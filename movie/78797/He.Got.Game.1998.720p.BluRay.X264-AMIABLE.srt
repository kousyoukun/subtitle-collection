1
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,600
Shuttlesworth!
Shuttlesworth!

2
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,480
-What's up, bro?
-Game's over. Warden wants to see you.

3
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
The warden?
What's this all about?

4
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,600
Don't know nothing.
Don't want to know nothing.

5
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,440
He tells me to get you,
so I get you.

6
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,720
Thank you, Books.
You may wait outside.

7
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,680
Jake, please sit down.
Sit down.

8
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,520
I was told you were
on the court.

9
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
Yes, sir.
I try to stay fit, trim.

10
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,480
You know, everything like that.
Keep my mind occupied.

11
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,240
As you already know, you've picked
the perfect recreation.

12
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,720
Dr. James Naismith
knew what he was doing.

13
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,360
-It's a great game, isn't it?
-Basketball, yes.

14
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,480
-You played some?
-Uh, yes, sir, when I was younger.

15
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,960
-You know, I put in a little work.
-I coach my son's team.

16
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,960
I ran a neighbourhood center.

17
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,400
Let's go. Show me that.
Oh, good!

18
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,440
That's good, but you crossed over.
You still bailed out.

19
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,920
-You coached?
-Nah, nothing like that there.

20
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,320
You know, I see somebody out there,
a little kid who needs some help.

21
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,600
I work with him,
give him a few tips.

22
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,040
-Which hand did you shoot with?
-Right.

23
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,280
-Which hand are you
supposed to be shooting with?
-Left.

24
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,720
But nowadays, uh,
Warden, they--

25
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,600
these kids ain't going to listen
to nothing you say, you know.

26
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,520
They think they know it all.

27
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,920
All they want to do is dunk and--
you know, everything like that.

28
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,880
Their fundamentals is, uh--
is, like, sorely lacking.

29
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,040
That's strange.
I haven't had that problem yet.

30
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,080
Yeah, well, you--


31
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
The kids are smart.

32
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,480
They know they don't listen to you,
they end up in here with me.

33
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,600
I never thought about it like that.

34
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,320
Did you vote for Governor Pernell?

35
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
Uh, nah, I ain't never voted.

36
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,640
No matter. What does matter
is Governor is a big,

37
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
huge, fanatical
basketball fan.

38
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,920
He played himself--
four years, varsity, at Big State.

39
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,920
Good, not great athlete.

40
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,560
He's the biggest supporter
Big State has. Bleeds red and white.

41
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I saw
something like that about him on TV.

42
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,200
Do you have a son named
Jesus Shuttlesworth?

43
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
Yes, sir.

44
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Is your son considered the number one
high school prospect...

45
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,080
in these United States
of America?

46
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,600
Some people rate him
that high, some don't.

47
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,960
-You know, two, three, six.
-Come on, Jake. Come on.

48
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Don't be modest. You ought to be proud.
You ought to be proud as a peacock.

49
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,280
I always been proud of my son even
before he was the number one prospect...

50
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
in the whole entire world.

51
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,640
-You aren't modest, after all.
-God is working with me on that, sir.

52
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,840
The governor's made a request
that your son, Jesus Shuttlesworth,

53
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,520
seriously consider enrolling
in his alma mater, Big State.

54
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,960
If you persuade your son
to do this,

55
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,240
the governor's given me
his word...

56
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,800
he'll do everything
in his power to...

57
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,480
cut your time here short,
considerably.

58
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,400
The governor can do that?
He can--

59
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,760
-He can do that.
-I'm looking at 15, Warden. I mean--

60
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
This is for real, right?

61
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,920
You can make the governor
very happy.

62
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,360
He's got a great reputation
for never forgetting anyone
who's done right by him.

63
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,360
He's also never forgiven anyone
who's done him wrong.

64
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,360
Can't do nothing in here, though.
I mean, behind these--

65
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,640
Behind these bars, you know,
these walls and everything like that,

66
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,440
I mean, something
like this here...

67
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,680
can't be worked out
over the phone or--

68
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,080
We have to get started right away.

69
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,280
The NC two -A deadline for kids
to declare is one week away.

70
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,760
-One week?
-Seven days.

71
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,120
Everything's been arranged.

72
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,720
-It's all been worked out.
-The Bulls ain't got nothing,

73
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,360
especially against
the Knicks.

74
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,680
All you ever talk about is
Jordan this, Jordan that.

75
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
Guard!

76
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
You do your part, you deliver your son,

77
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,520
-Guard!
-Governor Pernell will do his part.

78
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,400
-Guard!
-What the hell's going on in there?

79
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,720
You'll have to excuse
the temporary discomfort,

80
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,040
but we can't trust
in your abilities as an actor.

81
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
There's little margin
for error.

82
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,360
Let's go, Doc!
Hurry up.

83
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
Where you taking him?

84
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
-What's wrong with this inmate?
-I don't know.

85
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
-Food poisoning?
-Are you sure?

86
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
I don't know.
He just rolled him in.

87
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,280
I want this inmate
quarantined immediately.

88
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,520
-Looks like he ate some
of this fine prison cuisine.
-I can't take a chance.

89
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,400
Last time something like this happened,
half the prison population got sick.

90
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,320
-He's quarantined now. He's contagious.
-God!

91
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,400
One last thing.

92
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,520
Don't try any funny business.

93
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,560
Any shenanigans, the deal is off.

94
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,160
Any shenanigans, the deal is off.

95
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
Can't you make him shut up?

96
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,680
-The guy's in pain.
-Then give him something.

97
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
We got two more hours to go.
Man, I don't want to hear that shit.

98
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
Two parole officers
will be assigned to you.

99
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,760
-Spivey, he's a black man.

100
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,800
You should like him.
He should like you.

101
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
Your other chaperone is Crudup.

102
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,960
Quiet. But, as my father told me,
it's the quiet one's you have to watch.

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,080
Spivey, I'm sick
as a dog, man.

104
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,600
Here. Drink that.

105
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,800
Drink it.

106
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Spivey and Crudup,

107
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,400
two of the best,
handpicked by me.

108
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,640
If necessary, these men have
been given a green light to shoot.

109
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,640
We don't give a shit about you,
or you being sick as a dog.

110
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,640
You want to throw up, let us know.
We'll pull over.

111
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
You puke back there,
my main man Crudup will see to it...

112
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
that you lick it
all back up,

113
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,160
every single
nasty-ass drop.

114
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,840
You understand,
my brother? Capisce?

115
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Yeah, capisce.
Can you pull over?

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,960
Please?

117
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,920
Remember what my main man Spivey said.
Don't get any in the car.

118
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,400
-Not a drop, not a speck.

119
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,280
-Don't move too fast 
-What up?

120
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,680
-Let's keep control 
-What's up, bro?

121
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,400
He's always singing.

122
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,800
-You know, right?
-Yo, I sound good though, man.

123
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,400
Better take this court over, yo.

124
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,920
-We got to play for real.
-And don't be confused

125
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,400
You just have
to be willing

126
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,440
-Willing to end the--Aw!
-Shit!

127
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,800
Check out Rodman here.

128
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,520
Hey, yo, yo, yo!
We got next!

129
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
-Going to kick these motherfuckers' ass.
-For real.

130
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,600
Play ball!

131
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
Big man.

132
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,360
-Look at the pants on that kid, man.
-Let's go, baby.

133
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,040
-That's off.
-Break!

134
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,480
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, G!

135
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,640
Hey!

136
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,960
-Bring it on now.
-Move it by yourself. Come on.

137
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,080
-Block it.
-Whoa!

138
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,640
Aw, shit!

139
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,400
-I got it.
-Come on, come on, come on, come on.

140
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,600
Come on! I'm open.

141
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,200
-Ah, that's our ball.
-Nice shot, Johnny!

142
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Whoo-hoo!
Good pass, James!

143
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
-Just let me know.
-What's the score?

144
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,080
Let's go, Boog!

145
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,000
I got it.

146
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,200
I got hops, baby! I got hops.

147
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,920
Center court.

148
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840
You got it. You got it.

149
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,000
-Let's go, Boogs.
-Come on, baby. Let's go, baby.

150
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,640
Get ready to help out, Booger,
before we get beat. Just steal.

151
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,040
Show me something, kid.

152
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,320
I got it! All the way!
Fly! Alley-oop!

153
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,520
Show time!

154
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,280
Yeah! We're the Lincoln Railsplitters,
baby! What, what, what, what?

155
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,800
You didn't read the paper
that day, son?

156
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,240
Aw! Railsplitters!
That's right.

157
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,040
So Jesus
has led the Railsplitters...

158
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,640
to the Promised Land despite
being down late the second half.

159
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,480
Coach Cincotta's team
refused to die.

160
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,000
They come back to win it,
and there's bedlam at the Garden.

161
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Number one.

162
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,320
The game brings me
love, peace and happiness.

163
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,800
My name is Sip Rodgers.

164
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,000
I go to Abraham Lincoln High School.

165
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,920
I play the two-spot.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,680
We're the Railsplitters,
and nobody's fucking with us.

167
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
Basketball is like
poetry in motion.

168
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,360
Just coming down the court,
you got a defender in your way.

169
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,240
You take him to the left.
You take him back to the right.

170
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,480
And he's falling back,
and you just "J" right in his face.

171
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,080
And then you look at him,
and then you say, "What?"

172
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
Basketball's the birthplace
of all of my dreams,

173
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,080
of everything that I want to be, of
everything I want to accomplish in life.

174
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,680
I feel handsome when I'm on the court.
I feel like I'm somebody.

175
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
The way this goes down
is simple

176
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,440
From this day forth
anything dealing with rap stay off

177
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,120
This the play-offs
No payoffs, strictly skills

178
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,480
If your braings insane
then stick to your deals

179
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,360
In this field it ain't about selling
a mil wit' the run of the mill

180
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,120
So just be telling it real, it ain't
like a third-time felon's appeal

181
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,520
'Til a god schools them
and tells them the deal

182
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,840
I'll allow you to write
maybe allow you to bite

183
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,320
If you down to fight the power
here's the power to fight

184
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,120
I overpower the mic
Hit the crowd with the bomb diggy

185
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,120
Ring the alarm
Now the squad's wit' me

186
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,400
From way back I shown no weakness
when I speak this

187
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,960
Mentally strong to keep this hit
and my speech is given

188
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,240
Now listen from the beginning
'til I reach the ending

189
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,440
My short story's winning
and keep the beat spinning

190
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,640
You know the name, P.E.
You know the game, P.E.

191
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
We ain't for the fame
We for the change

192
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,440
Word is Bond, I wake up every day
wit' my game face on

193
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,040
You know the name, P.E.
You know the game, P.E.

194
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,160
We ain't for the fame
We for the change

195
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,200
Word is Bond, I wake up every day
wit' my game face on

196
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,160
We back harder than ever
Follow my lead

197
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,640
Through the fast lane
in the game

198
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,360
This is Mr. Shuttlesworth.
His key?

199
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,680
You ain't ready to get it, I don't
know why they keep asking for it

200
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,960
Is this guy going to mean
any trouble?

201
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,880
Nah, he's not
going to mean any trouble.

202
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,800
If you somewhat sure
Hip-hop's like a chess game

203
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,000
Discussing the war, strategize
Move like masterminds

204
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,320
-So where y'all staying at?
-Marriott, mid-town Manhattan.

205
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,000
That's what I figured. Why aren't
I staying down there with y'all?

206
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,560
Only place
on Coney Island, my man.

207
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,680
Why waste all that valuable time
commuting back and forth...

208
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,240
when you can walk
to see your son right from here?

209
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,600
You also don't have a choice.

210
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,880
The way I see it, this is better
than your room at the hoosegow.

211
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,600
-This is the Ritz to you.
-I ain't mad at nobody.

212
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,120
You understand
what I'm saying?

213
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah. Yeah, this is
better than the Marriott.

214
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,880
Keep your hands still.
There you go.

215
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,320
-All right. Sit down.
-Huh?

216
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,760
You heard what the fuck I said.
I said sit down!

217
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,720
There's a couple of things
I think we better go over.

218
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,960
Number one:
You ain't on vacation.

219
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,920
You're not a free man.

220
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,320
In the eyes of the law,
you are still a convicted felon.

221
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,480
Your ass is ours.
You understand that?

222
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,000
-Do you?
-Yeah, I over-stand it.

223
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,880
-Then answer us when we speak to you.
-I understand it, over-stand it.

224
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,320
The sooner you do
what you going to do,

225
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,720
the better it will be
for all concerned parties.

226
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,600
Mr. Shuttlesworth,
you are now wired.

227
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,800
It's a letter of intent
for your son to sign. Take it.

228
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,360
In here there's some money.
Get some clothing.

229
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Toothpaste, deodorant,
personal effects, whatever have you.

230
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,440
Take a shower. Wash your ass.

231
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,120
Give me your right leg.

232
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,800
Just in case you get any smart ideas,
we will track you down.

233
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,440
And when we find you,
we will shoot you dead.

234
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,400
-You have to check in with us daily.

235
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,680
Plus, when we page you, you have to
return our call within ten minutes...

236
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,800
or there's going to be
hell to pay.

237
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,800
Yeah. So y'all going to be
following me everywhere I go?

238
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,320
No, we're not going to
follow you.

239
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,360
We're going to get you a passport,
plane ticket and a VISA card.

240
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,720
Of course we're going to be around.
What the fuck you think we're going to do?

241
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,720
-So how long I got exactly?
-You got 'til midnight Sunday.

242
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,080
-I guess I better get working.
-That would be the best thing to do.

243
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,240
And we will see you tomorrow.

244
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,520
-Yeah, I bet you will.
-How's the tummy?

245
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,400
Great. Everything's lovely.
Nice seeing you gentlemen.

246
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
-Just in case.
-Thank you.

247
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
It's open.

248
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,800
Shit.

249
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
Thank you, Jesus.

250
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,800
Thank you.

251
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,600
If man is the father
the son is the center of the Earth

252
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,560
In the middle
of the universe

253
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,480
Then why is this verse
coming six times rehearsed

254
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,960
Don't freestyle much
but I write them like such

255
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,160
Amongst the themes
controlled by the screens

256
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,720
What does it all mean
all this shit I'm seeing

257
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,200
Human beings
screaming vocal javelins

258
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,480
Sign of a local nigga
unravelling

259
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,920
My wandering
got my ass wondering

260
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,280
Where Christ is
in all this crisis

261
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,760
Hating Satan
never knew what nice is

262
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,240
Check the papers
while I bet on ices

263
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,680
More than your eyes can see
and ears can hear

264
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,120
-Year by year all sense disappears
-Know y'all did your homework.

265
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,040
-Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear
-What's up?

266
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,120
Beware: two triple-0
is near

267
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,320
It might feel good
It might sound a little something

268
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,360
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothing

269
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,360
-What's up?
-What is game, who got game

270
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
-I saw you running.

271
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,360
Don't even try to play it off.

272
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,640
If you would've been on time,
there would've been no need to run.

273
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,360
-The bus would've come sooner,
I would've been on it.
-I didn't tell you?

274
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,080
The B-36 don't come
until I get here, Lala.

275
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,200
You know I got it like that.

276
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,480
Why you going to play me
like that?

277
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,320
-You played yourself, faded yourself.
-That's crazy.

278
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,520
Oh?

279
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,880
You're lucky the bus is here,
late like you.

280
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,440
People use
Even murders excused

281
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,680
So, uh, have you narrowed down
your choices yet?

282
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,600
Not yet.

283
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
You going to let me in
on your secret?

284
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,720
You know I'll never keep
anything from you, never.

285
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,480
Folks don't even
own themselves

286
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,760
Anyway, there's this guy
that I know that I want you to meet.

287
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,440
Who's the guy?

288
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
He's a friend of the family.
His name is D'Andre Mackey.

289
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,560
-What does he do?
-D'Andre's an agent.

290
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,000
You know I ain't supposed to be talking
to no agent. That shit is illegal.

291
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,120
All he wants to do is talk to you for
five minutes, see where your head is at.

292
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
My head is on my shoulders
and going to stay there.

293
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,880
I'm not fucking
with no agents, Lala.

294
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,840
Who got game
Where's the game in life

295
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,800
Jesus, please?

296
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,720
I got game
She got game

297
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,120
-Please?
-They got game, he got game

298
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,680
Come on. He's a friend
of the family.

299
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
-Five minutes of your time.
-So?

300
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,440
It's just five minutes of your time
before you make your decision.

301
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,680
Come on. Please?

302
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
I don't know.

303
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,520
Let me think about it.

304
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,440
-I'll see you fourth period, all right?
-Sounds good.

305
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,680
Mmm. Mmm.

306
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,000
-I'll be so happy
when this stuff is over with.
-It won't be long now.

307
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,480
What do you got? A Monday morning
10:00 a.m. press conference, right?

308
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,240
-Yeah.
-Have you made a decision yet?

309
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,080
You know what?
That's the thing that's bothering me.

310
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,800
And you know what? You're my coach,
right? I mean, I don't mind.

311
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,160
Every time I walk down the hallways,
"Where you going?

312
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,000
Where you going? Have you chosen a
school yet? Are you going to the NBA?"

313
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm going to tell y'all
Monday morning.

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,560
-I'm tired of hearing that.
-I can understand that.

315
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,480
Look, maybe it's in your best interest
to take it as a compliment.

316
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,400
People really do care about you.

317
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,680
People don't care about me.

318
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,000
They care about themselves.

319
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,000
They're just trying to get over, trying
to get a piece of Jesus, that's all.

320
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,920
Not everybody's a scumbag.

321
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,640
Some are--don't get me wrong--
but not everybody. Okay?

322
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,840
When are you going to make
a decision?

323
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,120
Sometime between now and
Monday morning, 10:00 a.m.

324
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,000
I still have a lot of thinking to do.
I have to weigh my options.

325
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,400
-You got my home phone number, right?
-Yeah, I got it.

326
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,200
You call me anytime.
I don't care how late it gets,
you want to talk this thing through.

327
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,320
Jesus, I always thought of you
as a son. You know that, right?

328
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,280
Yeah, I know that too.

329
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,840
You remember what I told you?
You remember?

330
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,240
-I remember. You tell me every day.
-What? What did I say?

331
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,600
I know what you told me, Coach.
I know, I know.

332
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,960
It'll make me feel good
again, all right?

333
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,280
This is going to be the most
important decision in your life.

334
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,800
-Hi, young man.
-I'm John Thompson
from Georgetown University.

335
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,520
Hello. I'm Dean Smith, the basketball
coach, University of North Carolina.

336
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm John Chaney
from Temple University.

337
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
I'm Roy Williams
from the University of Kansas.

338
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm Coach Noland Richardson,
the University of Arkansas.

339
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,240
I'm Lute Olson, head basketball coach
at the University of Arizona.

340
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,560
-And this will be--
-The most important decision--
-In your life.

341
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,760
This will be the most important
decision in your life.

342
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Coach, I understand
the magnitude of this decision.

343
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,040
God bless you, son.
I believe you do.

344
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,680
Baby, I love you 
You having a good time?

345
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,520
You having a good time?
Because you look so good.

346
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,800
Mmm, you look so good.
So you like the wig?

347
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,120
-I love it!
-You look great!
You look fucking wonderful!

348
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,480
You know what? You look like
Kim Novak from what movie?

349
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,040
-Vertigo.
-Vertigo, baby, I tell you.

350
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,280
So what do you want to do
for your birthday? It's your day.

351
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,600
I want to go on the Cyclone.
I want to go on the Turbo-Jet.

352
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,640
-I want to go on the Wonder Wheel.
-Damn!

353
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,360
Brother?

354
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,720
Do you know me?
Do you know my lady?

355
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,640
No, I don't think so.

356
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,320
Well, brother, you looking at us with
all that fucking familiarity and shit.

357
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,360
Mind your own business, man.

358
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,120
Yeah, you right.

359
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,040
Obviously, I'm wrong, brother.
It's my mistake, uh--

360
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,720
No disrespect.

361
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,800
I don't want no trouble, my man.

362
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,760
Bitch, what--
Get your motherfucking--

363
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,560
I got to meet your brother.
Please let me meet your brother.

364
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,920
I have to meet him. We'll talk about
this tomorrow. See you later, Mary.

365
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,600
See you, Sarah.

366
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,800
Miss Shuttlesworth.

367
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,320
Boo Boo.

368
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,800
-It's okay.
-Daddy.

369
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
How're you doing, baby?

370
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,640
Oh! My little woman.

371
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,960
-Daddy.
-How're you doing, baby?

372
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,720
Look at you. You done all grown up
and everything like that.

373
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,720
That's what I keep trying
to tell him.

374
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,160
-How's he doing? How's your brother?
-Bossy as usual.

375
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,080
He's supposed to be bossy
and everything like that.

376
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,720
He's supposed to be,
taking care of his little sister.

377
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,520
Daddy, when did you get out?

378
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,920
Last night.

379
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,840
Look. Come on.

380
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,240
Let me walk you over to Uncle Bubba
and Aunt Sally's house.

381
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,400
We don't live there anymore.
He moved us out.

382
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,360
-Where you all live at?
-O'Dwyer Gardens.

383
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,280
Uncle Bubba
hasn't changed a bit.

384
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,720
So who paying the rent?

385
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,720
-My brother.
-Your brother?

386
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,360
-He working?
-Naw.

387
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
-How long y'all been living around here?
-About a year.

388
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
-A year?
-Yeah.

389
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
That's good. How're you doing
in school? You doing all right?

390
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,440
-I got an "A" in Science.
-In Science, yeah? What you studying?

391
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,280
-Oh, cells or something.
-Cells?

392
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,480
Yeah, me too.

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,360
-So, this is our building.
-Right here?

394
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,840
Yeah.

395
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,040
It's all right.
This is pretty nice, actually.

396
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,840
So--

397
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,880
You ain't going to
invite me upstairs?

398
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,120
I don't know if I should.
I could get in trouble.

399
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,080
-With who?
-You know who.

400
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
All right.
Tell you what.

401
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,120
I'll leave before he come,
all right?

402
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,160
All right, Boo?

403
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,080
Okay.

404
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,680
What's in the bag?

405
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Toothbrush, toothpaste. An afro pick?

406
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,000
Underwear?
Skittles, Daddy!

407
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,960
Ha-ha!
You figured I forgot, huh?

408
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,000
-You went shopping?
-Yeah, a little bit. Who this, baby?

409
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
That's Lala.
Lala Bonilla, Jesus' lady.

410
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,920
Lala Bonilla.

411
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,200
Daddy, how'd you get out? I thought you
were going to be away a long, long time.

412
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,440
Can Daddy's little Boo Boo
keep a secret?

413
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,480
Yeah.

414
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,360
I'm out on a--what you call like a...
work release program, baby,

415
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,400
where's if l--

416
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,520
-Well, I got a week to do a job.
-Meaning?

417
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,840
Meaning if I do a good job,
I can get out sooner than expected.

418
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,600
-What kind of job do you have to do?
-I can't tell you that yet.

419
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,360
Because I'm too young.
I cannot wait until I'm 18.

420
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,160
I am tired of people telling me
that I'm not old enough.

421
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,480
"Can't do this. No, no, honey,
can't do this. You're too young--"

422
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,840
Hold on, hold on.
Sit down.

423
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,760
Look. Number one, you ain't too young.
You're a young woman.

424
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,320
It's just that I could...
get in trouble.

425
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,560
-Now, you don't want your daddy
to get in trouble, do you?
-No.

426
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,360
I don't want you getting into any more
trouble. I know it wasn't your fault.

427
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,960
I know you didn't mean it.

428
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,160
You don't know what
that means to your daddy.

429
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,720
Now, let's hit them Skittles.

430
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,640
Your brother, he's doing
all right, huh?

431
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,560
-He is so good.
-Yeah?

432
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,880
He is better than good, Daddy.
You should see him play.

433
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
He's a zillion times better
than when you last saw him.

434
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,120
-Remember when he used to be
so weak on his left hand?
-Yeah.

435
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,440
Naw, now he can handle it
with both.

436
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,800
-And he can shake so good.
-Can he?

437
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,000
I bet he can finally beat you.

438
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,360
You think so?

439
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,880
-Yeah, he probably can.

440
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,720
You've reached Mary and Jesus.
We're not at home.

441
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,720
-Leave a message at the beep.

442
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,880
It's me, baby. It's Lala.

443
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,360
Hello, son.

444
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,760
Mary, what did I tell you
about letting strangers in the house?

445
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,160
-He's not a stranger. He's our father.
-I don't have a father.

446
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,760
-Hey, wait a minute--
-Daddy, he's tripping.

447
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,720
Tripping? We'll see who's tripping
later on tonight.

448
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,000
-What did I tell you about
talking to strangers anyway?
-"Don't do it."

449
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,480
-And why?
-Because it may cause us harm.

450
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,280
So why did you let
this stranger in our house?

451
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,720
Mary, do you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.

452
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:16,960
Mary, do you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.

453
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,880
I'm not standing here for
my health, and you ain't deaf.

454
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,040
-Don't talk to your sister like that.
-Am I talking to you?

455
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,320
Matter of fact, I don't
even know why you're here.

456
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,360
Mary, answer me right now.

457
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,560
I won't do it again,
I promise!

458
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,320
It's time for you
to get to stepping.

459
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,800
And I'd appreciate it if you don't
ever walk through that door ever again.

460
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,520
All right.
Look, I need to talk to you.

461
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,920
-Why?
-I just need to. When can we talk?

462
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
I don't know.
I'm usually around.

463
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,280
-Where you going to be at?
'Cause this is kind of urgent.
-I'm usually at the Garden.

464
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
-All right.
-All right.

465
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,720
-I'll see you down there.
-Yeah, you can see me there.

466
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,120
Enjoy the Skittles, baby.

467
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,880
Now you enjoy walking
out that front door.

468
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,640
-Where you think you're going?
-Help!

469
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,720
Get in there!

470
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,960
Open the door!

471
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,880
-Who's trying to break the door down?
-Booger!

472
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,680
What's up?

473
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,760
Hey, how y'all doing?

474
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,040
-Not good.
-What's wrong, dear?

475
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,560
-Guess who showed at the apartment?
-Who?

476
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,960
-Daddy.
-Lord have mercy!

477
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,720
-Booger, take your cousin in your room.
-Go in the room.

478
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Come on, Mary. Um--

479
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,160
You can play with
my Sony Playstation.

480
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,240
-Good, 'cause I can always beat you.
-I'm getting good at--

481
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,400
Sit down, son.

482
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,920
When did all this happen?

483
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,480
-About half an hour ago.
-What did he say? What does he want?

484
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,640
He says he wants to speak to me.
He says it's urgent.

485
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,400
-It don't make no sense.
-It makes perfect sense.
He smells the money.

486
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,680
What I'd like to know, how does a
convicted murderer get out so quick?

487
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,200
How can this happen?
He's not even eligible for parole yet.

488
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,560
He told Mary that he was out
on a work release program or something.

489
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,200
The man escaped
just like Shawshank.

490
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,200
Clint Eastwood in Escape From Alcatraz.
The Fugitive.

491
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,240
-He wasn't acting like no fugitive.
-We should call the cops.

492
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,480
-Yeah.
-We ain't going to do no such a thing.

493
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,560
I think you need to go
and talk to your father.

494
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,480
He ain't my father,
all right?

495
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,320
I know how you feel, son,
but the fact remains he is your daddy.

496
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,920
But as your legal guardians as appointed
by the court in the state of New York,

497
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,560
I feel you need to involve us
more in your life.

498
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Jesus, we're family.

499
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,800
Your mother--Martha,

500
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,680
my sister--I loved her.

501
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,360
We feel responsible
for the both of you.

502
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,040
I made a promise to your mother
that if anything ever happened to her,

503
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,600
that we would be there
for the both of you.

504
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,160
You hear me, Jesus?

505
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,760
Like I said, son, you need to talk
to your daddy, see what he has to say.

506
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,320
I told him I'd be here
at the Garden.

507
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,600
Before you go now, I want you to use
some of my John the Conqueror root.

508
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,280
This is what my daddy brought
up here from Mississippi.

509
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,160
Now, you rub some of this here between
your wrist and your elbow, see,

510
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,120
just like this here.

511
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,000
-Now, this'll fix you up real good.
-Oh, Bubba.

512
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,200
Don't nobody care nothing
about your country, backward old root.

513
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,240
-This mojo works! It worked on your ass!
-Hmph!

514
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,280
-No, thanks, Uncle Bubba.
-Suit yourself.

515
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,160
-You make a decision yet?
-No, not yet.

516
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,000
Your Aunt Sally feels bad
that we aren't being included
in such an important decision.

517
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
He does not speak for me!
You do what you feel is right.

518
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,840
-Thank you, Aunt Sally.
-Will you be quiet, please?

519
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,520
What they offering you, boy?
What they going to give you?

520
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,080
-Full athletic scholarship.
-Whoo! That's wonderful!

521
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,400
Full athletic scholarship,
that's all?

522
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,160
No money, no cars,
no job for your family?

523
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,120
-No school say nothing like that.
-See, I don't believe that.

524
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,160
You're trying
to hold out on us.

525
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
-Holding out?
-You're trying to cut us out the deal.

526
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,840
-What deal?
-The deal is about to go down!
I hear things.

527
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,800
No, you ain't hear that.

528
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,160
Think of your Uncle Bubba,
your Aunt Sally.

529
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,040
I think it's only right that we
be compensated for sacrifices...

530
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,040
we made when we
took y'all in.

531
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,960
Bubba! I don't want
any part of this.

532
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
I'm going into the bedroom.

533
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,800
Good. Take your big ass
on in the bedroom, then.

534
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,680
Why you got to talk to Aunt Sally
like that? I thought we were family.

535
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,000
-We are family. Blood, thick as thieves.
-I don't even know why l--

536
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,360
My controls ain't working.
It's sticking or something.

537
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.
Say it. I'm the bomb.

538
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,840
Mm-hmm, yo, I'm the bomb.
You know I'm the bomb, right?

539
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,640
Now, we put out
a lot of money for y'all.

540
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,560
All I'm asking is that you
let me wet my beak a little bit.

541
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,280
-Wet your beak?
-Wet my beak, son.

542
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,280
You didn't see The Godfather II?
The man was called The Black Hand.

543
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,640
-I suspect you already
got a deal in place.
-What kind of deal?

544
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,880
The kind of deal that would enable you
to get your own apartment,

545
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,560
pay rent, pay Ma Bell,

546
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,440
pay Con Ed, buy clothes, furniture
with no visible means of income.

547
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,680
You ain't got no job, son!
No J-O-B!

548
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,800
Don't try to play me for no fool now.

549
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,800
-Am I making this clear?
-Yeah, you're making it very clear!

550
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,880
When I really get paid, I ain't going to
lose track of you and Aunt Sally!

551
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,480
I'm going to take care of you,
with interest if you want!

552
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,440
I ain't too old to have dreams.
Is that what you think?

553
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,120
I still got dreams.
I got plans too. Big plans.

554
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,000
-Now, why should me and
your Aunt Sally get cut off?
-Anything else, Uncle Bubba?

555
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,440
-Yo.
-Yeah!

556
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,640
-Check them.
-Ahh!

557
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,560
These are the new Jordans.

558
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,160
That's it, huh? Yeah.
How much these cost, man?

559
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,480
-139, 150 with tax.
-One-fifty? Where the holes at?

560
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,200
They're on the inside.
You got to lace them up that way.

561
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,640
-Do that for me, man, all right?
-Yeah, no problem, man.

562
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,640
Let's get rid of this first.

563
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
139!

564
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,320
It's arthritis.

565
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,280
You know, I got that, uh...
arthritis thing happening.

566
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,080
Yeah? My brother's got
the same arthritic condition.

567
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,840
-Really?
-Only it's his left ankle.

568
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,760
-It's going around here in Coney Island.
-Yeah, yeah. It's contagious.

569
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,960
-Like the plague.
-Yeah.

570
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,440
Damn, what's he doing here?

571
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Hello, Mr. Shuttlesworth.

572
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,880
Since when do you start
calling your uncle Mister?

573
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,800
Hello, Uncle Jake.

574
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,440
-Huh?
-Hello, Uncle Jake.

575
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,320
-How you doing? You all right?
-Okay.

576
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,600
-How's your game?
-Okay.

577
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,920
-That left hand coming?
-Okay.

578
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
-Schoolwork?
-Okay.

579
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,960
All right.

580
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,440
So it look like you, uh--
look like you grew a little bit.

581
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,840
-You think so?
-Oh, no doubt.

582
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,440
-You ain't clowning me, are you?
-I wouldn't clown you, son.

583
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,960
I know you grew--
What, a couple, three inches?

584
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,400
-Yo, for reals?
-It's the truth.

585
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm--

586
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,560
That's the best news
I've heard in weeks.

587
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,680
All right. Well, cool.

588
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,640
I'm going to let you two talk,
you know, get reacquainted.

589
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,040
Hey, you eating
them vegetables, boy?

590
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,840
-Always, man. Hey, welcome back.
-All right.

591
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,120
-All right.
-So you got new Jordans, I see.

592
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,840
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, a little something, son, you know.

593
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,200
So you ready?
One-on-one?

594
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,640
Still can't beat your pops?

595
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
No, thank you.

596
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,680
-You ain't no competition.
-I ain't no competition?

597
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,800
-Naw.
-Son, l--

598
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,800
-If your mother could see--

599
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Hey, all right. I'm sorry, all right?
Hey, wait a minute.

600
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,840
That's the wrong way to start
a conversation with me.

601
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,760
All right. Hold up, hold up.

602
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,280
Look, you get
any of them letters?

603
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah, I got
your stupid letters.

604
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,160
I tore them up too.

605
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,720
-What about Mary's?
-I tore those up too.

606
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,840
All right. Since you too scared
to play me, can we talk for a moment?

607
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,200
-Talk about what?
-A lot of things.

608
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,800
I got to ask you a few questions,
you know, catch up on things.

609
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,680
Look, I don't have a lot of time,
so make it quick.

610
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,560
I got even less time,
so I'm going to make it real quick.

611
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,560
I read all about you,
everything like that, and, uh--

612
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,800
Game really developed.
All the hard work done paid off.

613
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,360
I'm proud of you, son.
I mean that.

614
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,440
I know these are
tough times for you now.

615
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,600
So I figure, hey, you know,
you might need some fatherly advice.

616
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,080
-From who?
-From me.

617
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,840
-About what?
-About, number one,
where you going to go to school.

618
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,240
-Have you made a decision?
-Aw, damn! You too?

619
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
I already know
what you're about to say.

620
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,560
"This is about to be the most
important decision in your life."

621
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,600
That ain't what I was about to say.
I'm going to ask you--

622
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
I'm just hoping that you
ain't compromising yourself, son.

623
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,760
I know what's going on. I know people
are offering you all kinds of things.

624
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,480
I just don't want to see you beholden
to somebody for something you done took.

625
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,640
-Something I took?
-Yeah.

626
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,000
What do you expect? I got to
take care of Mary, nobody else but me.

627
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,360
I refuse to let Mary grow up
in the same apartment with Uncle Bubba.

628
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,160
Look. All I'm saying is--
I would like to know where you're going.

629
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,120
-What difference does it
make where I'm going?
-I would like to know.

630
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,200
I don't know yet.
I have to weigh my options.

631
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,480
-You got any idea?
-Like I told the rest of
the world, I don't know yet.

632
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,680
I pray that you understand...

633
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,120
why I pushed you so hard.

634
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,560
It was only to get you
to that next level, son.

635
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,200
You's the first Shuttlesworth that's
even going to make it out these projects.

636
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,840
I was the one who put the ball in
your hand. I put the ball in your crib.

637
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,920
-I ain't no baby no more.
-All right.

638
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,440
Why the hell did you name me Jesus
anyway? What type of name is that?

639
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,400
-It's a biblical name.
-No kidding.

640
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
-You don't like that name?
-I never liked my name.

641
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,800
-You ain't never told me.
-I used to tell Mommy a lot of things.

642
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,000
-Why you ain't never tell me?
-You haven't been around lately.

643
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,800
I used to hate for Mom
to call me in to come in for dinner.

644
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,240
Jesus! Jesus!

645
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,080
You're lucky my dribble's got--

646
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,920
-Dusted in for the N.B.A.
-Shut up! You look like--

647
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,320
-You look like a cockroach.
-Cockroach?

648
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,640
Cockroach this then.
Cockroach this.

649
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,760
That way. That way.

650
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,520
You just can't shoot
the darn fool.

651
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,360
-Ooh, shoot it? Shoot it?
-Yeah, shoot it.

652
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,080
Jesus!

653
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,400
-Jesus! Jesus!
-Jesus!

654
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,160
Jesus, time to come in and eat.
Bring your cousin Booger with you.

655
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,400
Could I just finish
one more shot, please?

656
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,640
-No! I said now, and I mean it!
-Come on.

657
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,960
People used to think she was
some type of religious freak,
catching the Holy Ghost.

658
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,960
Save me, Jesus!
Save me, Jesus!

659
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,840
-Just stop, Booger! That ain't funny!
-Well, it's funny to me.

660
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,320
Funny to me, just like you picking
and eating your boogers all the time.

661
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,040
-I don't eat my boogers!
-Yes, you do!

662
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,480
Man, you never seen me
eat my boogers.

663
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,920
How many you see me eat?
One, two or three?

664
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,800
I came to this court by myself.
Why you got to follow me?

665
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,160
-Maybe I wanted to play with Jesus.
-Jesus!

666
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,160
Jesus! Jesus!

667
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,480
-Jesus!
-Look at that.

668
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,200
Moses parted the Red Sea,
not Jesus.

669
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,320
-Moses, Jesus, whatever.
-Whatever?

670
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,760
Whatever.

671
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,960
Everybody and their mama's running
around saying they're born again.

672
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,360
Especially all
these athletes and entertainers.

673
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,200
They get caught smoking crack
in the hotel with ten whores.

674
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,360
All of a sudden they have a religious
experience? They find Jesus, all right.

675
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,840
What's wrong with finding Jesus, huh?
What's wrong with that?

676
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,120
How come you never hear Jesus being
praised in the losers' locker room then?

677
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,800
-They're probably cursing
that motherfucker out.
-Hey, wait, wait, wait.

678
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,760
-First, number one--
-God ain't shit.

679
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,560
Number one, why you got to use
all this kind of language?

680
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,960
You some kind of heathen now?
You don't make no mistakes?

681
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,840
You be out here shooting, but you
don't miss no shots ever? Ever?

682
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,360
People make mistakes. People veer off
the path. So what? God forgives them.

683
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,760
-Has God forgiven you
for killing my mother?
-I pray that He has.

684
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,760
-I believe He has. When will you?
-Never.

685
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,680
All right.
Well, hey, look.

686
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,840
-Hey. Shit.
-"Thou shall not kill."

687
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,360
-Isn't that from the Good Book?
-That's in the Good Book. So?

688
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,920
So what? Ain't nothing I can do, son,
that can bring your mother back.

689
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,200
What you want me to do, huh?

690
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,200
Did you even love my mother?

691
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,720
Yes, I loved her!

692
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,520
I loved her more than life itself.

693
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,560
You sure did have
a hell of a way of showing it.

694
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,080
When you going back anyway?

695
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,160
Yo, I got next.
I got next game, bro.

696
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,560
I want to go eat.

697
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,400
Jesus, you off
the phone yet?

698
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,680
Hey.

699
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,120
You been on the phone
all night.

700
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,000
All these schools calling, we need
to just get another unlisted number.

701
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,440
-It still gets out.
-I'll be so glad when
all this stuff is over.

702
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,880
-I know you will.
-How long's it going to be?

703
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,120
-Monday morning.
-Praise the Lord, and thank you, Jesus.

704
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,720
You think that's funny, don't you?

705
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,920
-I like teasing you.
-I know you do.

706
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,840
Everybody says I'm going to be rich,
won't have to worry about a thing.

707
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,080
-Did your father tell you that?
-No, but everybody else in the world.

708
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,680
Everybody else
in the world don't know.

709
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,720
Everybody says you're going to play pro
ball and have your own Nike sneakers...

710
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,320
and star in commercials
and make mad loot.

711
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,840
So much money that we won't be
in Coney Island no more.

712
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,800
What did I tell you about listening
to what people say?

713
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,440
I hear what you say, but if
everybody's saying the same
thing, it's got to be true.

714
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,640
Uncle Bubba even said you were
going to buy him and Aunt Sally
some new house in Long Island.

715
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,200
He asked me if I want
to go house shopping with him.

716
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,400
Looking for a big old house, too,
with, like, a green lawn and grass...

717
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,200
and lots of trees
and even a swimming pool in the back.

718
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,320
-Uncle Bubba told you that?
-Mm-hmm.

719
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,080
-I'm going to have to talk
to that uncle of yours.
-All the kids in school say,

720
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,520
-I'm going to have to talk
to that uncle of yours.
-All the kids in school say,

721
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,400
since I'm going to be
so rich and famous, that...

722
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,880
I'm not going to need to go
to school anymore...

723
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,920
'cause I already know how to count
and I'm just wasting my time.

724
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,640
If I hear you talking like that again,
I'll kill you myself!

725
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,040
Dang! Let go of me!

726
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,480
All those kids don't mean shit!
I'm raising you, nobody else!

727
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,400
-Get off of me!
-We're not rich.

728
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,320
We don't have no money.
We don't have shit.

729
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,960
If those were really
your friends, they wouldn't be
filling your head with bullshit.

730
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,840
I didn't say I believed it. I just said
that that's what people are saying.

731
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,200
-Can't believe you listen
to that bullshit.
-Fine! I'm sorry, all right?

732
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,520
Goodness!

733
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,280
You never tell me nothing.
You never even have time for me no more.

734
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,080
Well, it's going to be over
Monday morning, okay?

735
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,120
I'm really tripping.

736
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,360
I'm sorry. I apologize
for putting my hands on you, okay?

737
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,920
I'm just--I'm afraid.

738
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,360
Me too.

739
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,320
I mean, I just want
the best for both of us.

740
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,800
And, you know, Mommy,
she wanted you to go to college.

741
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,320
All these people around here, half
these people aren't going to college.

742
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,800
Mommy wants you
to get your degree.

743
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,160
Why is Daddy here?
Why did he come back?

744
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,160
He's not going to be here
much longer.

745
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,640
But, Jesus,
I miss him so, so much.

746
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,360
-Go to sleep.
-Good night.

747
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,680
Hello, everyone. I'm Robin Roberts.
Welcome to Sports Center.

748
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,320
Tonight, our feature is
about a biblical player--

749
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,040
the Chosen One, the second coming,
the resurrection,

750
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,000
the salvation.

751
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,160
ESPN gets religion as we follow a day
in the life of Abraham Lincoln senior...

752
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,640
Jesus Shuttlesworth, the number one
basketball prospect in the country.

753
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,960
Jesus of Coney Island.

754
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,320
Jesus is the best thing to happen to the
game since the tennis shoe was invented.

755
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,360
Jim Faen from Mount
Saint Mary's used to say,

756
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,080
"He gives me a tingle,"
and I think that's what Jesus does.

757
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,200
He makes you excited
to watch him.

758
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,280
Whew! Jesus Shuttlesworth.

759
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,160
He's the next phenom!
He's awesome, baby, with a capital "A"!

760
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,200
The guy's unbelievable!
He's a P.T.P., a prime time player!

761
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,320
He's the 3-S man!
Super, scintillating, sensational!

762
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,960
He's a high riser!

763
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,960
His game has got
everything you need.

764
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,720
He can defend.
He can run. He can finish.

765
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,280
He likes to play in a crowd,
and he can pass the basketball.

766
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,400
He makes people better.
He's the real thing.

767
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,480
He's able to do some of the things
that most coaches talk about,

768
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,240
and that is being able
to be a triple threat.

769
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,320
If that's something that we
as coaches have used for many
years--dribble, pass and shoot.

770
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,560
Pure shooter, fearsome defender,
a great player.

771
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,360
He was coming down for a fast break,
and the defender went for the ball.

772
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,880
He brought it behind his back
and switched it over to his right hand.

773
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,440
It went through his legs.

774
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,280
Defender came up and kind of
stutter-stepped a little bit,

775
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,520
pulled back and rang the three.

776
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,440
This kid might be ready
for the big leagues.

777
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,440
He plays to win, and a lot
of people play to play.

778
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,760
This guy plays to win.

779
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,480
He understands that if he
performs better, they are going to win.

780
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,280
But he knows how to pass.
He plays with his teammates.

781
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,480
He has all the attributes
that go into being a winner.

782
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,480
When I watched
Kenny Anderson's stuff,

783
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,880
-I'd never thought I would see
anybody better than those guys.
-Shit.

784
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,880
But along came Jesus.

785
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,480
There are very few players
that give you 40 minutes of everything.

786
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,280
Michael Jordan'll give you 35.
But 40 minutes of everything he's got...

787
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,120
because of what he's overcome
in his life.

788
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,480
In terms of dealing
with his sister,

789
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,160
and all of the pitfalls that come
with being in a deprived situation.

790
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,480
And in a situation that's void of any
kind of leadership other than his own,

791
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,280
he's had to be
very, very self-reliant.

792
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,120
Now, with kids as good as he is, he's
probably receiving a lot of pressure...

793
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,080
to go into the N.B.A.
because so many kids are doing it.

794
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,440
When you see a kid with this kind
of talent, it's almost normal for him...

795
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,560
to take that into consideration with the
kind of money that they're getting now.

796
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,520
But I would tell him that he needs to go
to college and get an education...

797
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,960
so that he'll be able to save
the money that he has.

798
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
My mother, she always
told me that, that...

799
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,440
it was great to be a superstar athlete
and to be able to make it to the N.B.A.

800
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,040
But... I mean, you're nothing
without your education.

801
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,200
And, you know, ever since day one,
she wouldn't let me play basketball.

802
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,200
She wouldn't let me play in the garden,
from day one, unless I did my homework.

803
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,120
That's right.

804
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,400
I think when April 11th comes,
I just want to let my hair down,

805
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,320
kick my feet up
and have a good time.

806
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,640
Just go hang out with my boys
back in high school:

807
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,280
-Sip, Booger, Lonnie, Mance.
-Lincoln! Linc--Linc--Lincoln!

808
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,400
-Man, those are my partners.
-My name is Sip!

809
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,320
Whether east or west!

810
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,080
-Yeah!
-I rock this joint!

811
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,600
-Yeah!
-With the most finesse. Roll call!

812
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,480
Lincoln! Linc--Linc--Linc--
Lincoln! Roll call!

813
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,240
-My name is Jesus.
-Yeah!

814
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,960
-I am the man.
-Yeah!

815
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,400
-What's up with these questions...
-Yeah!

816
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,600
about my plan?

817
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,800
I think it would just be
a sin that...

818
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,000
you know, come...
two months from now,

819
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,640
when I graduate,

820
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,200
my mother, she won't be able
to attend my graduation...

821
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,480
because, of course, she passed.

822
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,720
What most impresses me
about Jesus Shuttlesworth...

823
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,960
is the foresight
of his parents...

824
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,840
to name him appropriately
as the world's greatest.

825
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,680
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Jesus.

826
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,120
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Oh, Jesus!

827
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,880
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Jesus.

828
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,760
-Jesus.
-Jesus.
-Jesus.

829
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,040
-Jesus.
-Hallelujah, Jesus! Hallelujah!

830
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,520
He got game.

831
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,840
Who brought you this Victoria's Secret
bra-and-panties shit?

832
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,760
Bitch, where do you get
this shit from? You crazy?

833
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,640
-Bitch, are you out of your fucking mind?

834
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,560
-Dakota.
-I'm sorry.

835
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,520
Damn!

836
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,080
I'm sorry, baby.

837
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,800
The director is God.

838
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,440
You have no vision from nobody.

839
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,640
You trying
to antebellum my ass.

840
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,880
You trying to fucking
plantationalize on me, ain't you?

841
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,040
Bitch, this ain't Gone With The Wind.

842
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,520
You ain't Scarlett O'Hara!
I ain't Rhett Butler!

843
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,600
Bitch, I'll kick your ass.

844
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,880
Take that goddamn shit off.

845
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,880
Fucking with me.

846
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,200
Who the fuck
you think you are?

847
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,440
I'm sorry.

848
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,440
Bitch must be crazy.

849
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,080
Chilling me with some goddamn shit
from some other motherfucker.

850
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,840
Who the fuck
does she think she is?

851
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,640
I can't believe that bitch
did me like this.

852
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,560
Hello?

853
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
You all right? I heard
a lot of noise next door.

854
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,160
I thought maybe you need some help,
or something like that.

855
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,680
Here, let me help you up.

856
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,600
-What the hell do you want?
-It's all right. Come here.

857
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,560
I won't hurt you.
Come here.

858
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,040
You can walk? You all right?

859
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,360
Yeah. I need... some help!

860
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,840
You weren't knocking on that door
while I was getting my ass beat.

861
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,280
-Yeah, well, I didn't want to get
all up in your business--
-Smart, huh?

862
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,160
-My God, it's funny, isn't it?
-Y'all got some ice around here?

863
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,920
Oh, the sink doesn't work. There's
some cold water in the bathroom tub.

864
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,480
Oh, God.

865
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,240
At least I still got my teeth.

866
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,360
-Put this right here.
-Thanks.

867
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,280
Yeah. Right there.

868
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,200
I seen you around, you know.

869
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,400
-I noticed you right away.
-Yeah?

870
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,400
-You don't belong here.
-Oh, yeah? How can you tell that?

871
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,640
You don't seem like
the type of guy that would be here...

872
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,960
in this house of ill repute.

873
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,440
My name's Dakota.

874
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,920
You ever been there?

875
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,280
-Where?
-Dakota.

876
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,960
Oh, no, no, no.
I ain't never been nowhere.

877
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,960
I'm from upstate New York.

878
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,480
-I'm, uh, Jake. Jake--
-Please, no last names.

879
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,720
In my line of work,
last names aren't needed.

880
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,000
You're actually better off
without them.

881
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,280
-Why he beat you like that?
-Because he can.

882
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,200
And why you let him though?

883
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,400
Look. Are you trying to get
inside my head or something?

884
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,520
-You trying to see how I think?
-Naw.

885
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,560
You think you're
real slick, huh?

886
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,360
Naw, I just, you know--

887
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,560
I just want to get
to know you or something.

888
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,160
Look, I'm not a crack 'ho, okay?
I don't do drugs.

889
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,200
-I ain't accusing you of nothing, baby--
-Good.

890
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,640
I just want you to know--
I don't do drugs. I'm clean.

891
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,080
Right.

892
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,640
You still didn't answer
my question though.

893
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,880
Why you allow this, this,
this... pimp, you know, to just--

894
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,040
-His name is Sweetness.
-Is what?

895
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,000
-His name is Sweetness.
-All right.

896
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,960
All right.
Why you allow Sweetness...

897
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,280
to, you know, more or less,
just beat you down?

898
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,120
A lot of reasons.

899
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,000
-Mm.
-Take your pick.

900
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,960
Shoot.

901
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,960
I love him. He loves me.

902
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,080
I'm his number one money-maker.
I'm his bottom bitch.

903
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,000
Uh, low self-esteem.
I was abused as a child.

904
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,680
And, you know, I deserved it.
It keeps me in line.

905
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,960
And he always says he's sorry.

906
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,600
You know,
we're going to get married...

907
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,240
once he saves up enough money
to get out of this...

908
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,160
sh-shit-hole.

909
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,600
Here, let me freshen
that up for you.

910
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,240
So what about you?

911
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,200
I mean, look.

912
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,520
That's one of my problems,
or one of my many problems.

913
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,000
I tell people my whole life history and
I don't even know a thing about them.

914
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,680
Ah. Well, I told you
my first name was Jake,

915
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,960
and, uh, I got two children.

916
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,400
Got a son.
His name is Jesus,

917
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,520
and, uh, got a daughter
named Mary.

918
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,640
Are you, like,
religious or something?

919
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,240
Oh, most definitely. Most defin--
Well, more so like, uh--

920
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,240
Well, spirituality too.

921
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,000
You really think
you're slick, huh?

922
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,880
I'm not talking anymore
about me until you...

923
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,000
start talking some more
about you.

924
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,840
All right. Well, um...

925
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,320
I like you, you know, uh,
fa--uh, Dakota.

926
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,280
And, uh...

927
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,920
I think that, uh...
I can help you.

928
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,640
You know, trying
to fuck me isn't going to help me.

929
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,000
-Okay?
-I ain't talking about
nothing like that.

930
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,200
Why do you all men think...
dick is the cure-all?

931
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,480
I don't know about all men,
but I don't even think like that.

932
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,360
-Oh, no?
-No.

933
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,280
-You got a dick, don't you?
-Without a doubt.

934
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,200
-You got balls, don't you?
-Both of them. Both of them.

935
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,440
You really
think you're slick, huh?

936
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,000
No. I don't think
nothing like that.

937
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,720
So you want to know
something about me, or not?

938
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,960
I'm sorry.

939
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,240
I talk too much.
That's what Sweetness always says.

940
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,160
Where's my wig?

941
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,080
Damn!

942
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,880
-You lost your wig?
-Where's my wig?

943
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,320
Oh, man.

944
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,240
Look under the bed.

945
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,120
Bingo. There it is.

946
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,160
-Thanks.
 -All right.

947
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,680
Anyway, uh, l, uh...

948
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,400
have a wife--
had a wife named Martha...

949
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,640
and, uh...
I love her very much.

950
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,760
Uh, I took her life.

951
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,280
I murdered her, and, uh...

952
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,440
I'm serving time
for that right now.

953
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,360
I still got a ways
to go, and, uh...

954
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,880
I guess it's like God is paying--
making me pay for my sins.

955
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,800
Fuck you.

956
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,560
Okay? You killed your wife?
I don't believe you.

957
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,240
Well, it don't matter, but,
you know, it's true, uh...

958
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,480
I'm on a kind of a...
work release program.

959
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,320
Well, here we are, huh?

960
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,360
Both fucked-up people.

961
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,040
...kept his mouth shut before the game.

962
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,000
Let's go to the Garden.

963
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,320
First quarter, Knicks up one.
Jordan for three?

964
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,920
Boo-yeah!
M.J. got much game.

965
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,480
Beaucoup game
in the first quarter alone.

966
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,000
-Jesus.
-I don't know yet.

967
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,440
-No, it's me, baby. It's Lala.
-What time is it anyway?

968
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,360
It's like 1:00 a.m.
I'm really sorry it's so late,

969
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,400
but I really have
to speak to you.

970
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,800
-Honey, I really need you to meet with
that guy I was telling you about.
-Who?

971
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,520
-He still wants just
five minutes of your time.
-What's his name again?

972
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,840
D'Andre Mackey.
He's a good brother also.

973
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,720
-He's a good brother?
-Yeah.

974
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,640
I don't know.
I was dreaming.

975
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,400
I don't know, Lala.

976
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,320
I'll get in trouble
for this.

977
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,520
Look, I told you he's a really
good friend of the family,

978
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,640
and... it would mean
a lot to me.

979
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,560
So, please?

980
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,160
All right, all right. Just let
me go back to sleep, okay?

981
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,400
-Okay. I'll arrange everything.
-I'll see you tomorrow at school.

982
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,280
Good night.

983
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,840
-Jesus?
-What?

984
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,040
-I love you.
-I love you too.

985
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
So, what did he say?

986
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,040
He's down whenever
you want to meet.

987
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,800
Let's go, Shuttlesworth!

988
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,080
Yeah, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

989
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,440
-Morning, Jake.
-Hey, what's happening?

990
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,800
What time is it?

991
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,080
Time for you to get
your ass out of bed.

992
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,040
You see, if I was you, I wouldn't
spend too much time sleeping.

993
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,240
-Well, you ain't me, is you?
-That's right. I haven't killed anybody.

994
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,160
-Yet.
-Why you got to take it there, Spivey?

995
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,840
Come on, everybody, let's be friends.

996
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,840
You know, it's
Tuesday morning, and time is flying.

997
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,440
You trying to make me feel better?
I know what day it is.

998
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,520
I don't want you to lose track of time.
You see, we're on a tight schedule.

999
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,720
We can all go back early,
if you just...

1000
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,680
decide to give it up.

1001
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,600
Throw in the towel.

1002
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,280
You know, you haven't had
too much success with your son yet.

1003
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,760
-Have you?
-Come on now. Leave the man alone.

1004
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,400
It's not over 'til it's over,
'til the fat lady sings.

1005
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,600
That's right. That's right.
So since I'm on the clock,

1006
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,080
if you two gentlemen don't mind,
can I get on with my day?

1007
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,120
We're leaving.

1008
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,960
-Just doing our job, baby.
-We all happy in our work, ain't we?

1009
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,080
Y'all want some breakfast?

1010
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,120
Naw, naw, naw. We had the continental
over at the Marriott.

1011
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,320
-Yeah? Ain't as good as this though.

1012
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,520
Give me one at a time,
one at a time.

1013
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,440
-Can I have your autograph?
-Back up.

1014
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,600
Hey, yo, back up! Hey, back up,
back up! Let the man breathe.

1015
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,400
Give him some air.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.

1016
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,600
You want his autograph now, 'cause it's
going to be worth big money real soon.

1017
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,400
Now go on.
Hey, man, back up!

1018
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,320
Here you go.
Here you go, partner.

1019
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,560
Take it easy, Booger.
It's going to be all right.

1020
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,480
I'll take care of you,
all right? See?

1021
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,000
I wonder where the hell
this bus is. Damn!

1022
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,000
-For whom the final bell tolls 
-Whoo!

1023
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,040
-Big Time, what's up, baby?

1024
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,760
-What up, J-man?
-You got it.

1025
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,920
You not rolling public transportation
with all these knuckleheads.

1026
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,160
Big Time Willie, that's what I've been
trying to tell him but he won't listen.

1027
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,840
-I like to ride the bus.
These are my people.
-Hey, what's up with Jake?

1028
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,040
-These are my peeps right here.
-Yo, man, it's your pops.

1029
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,080
How are you doing, son?
Can I talk to you for a second?

1030
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,720
-One-on-one--
-Naw. Boog, get in the fucking car.

1031
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,280
We late for school.
Get in the fucking car, now.

1032
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,320
-Son--
-Hey, don't push me, man.

1033
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,200
-Can I talk to you, son?
-I don't know. You'll see me around.

1034
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,360
-Just off the back--
-Bye, Uncle Jake.

1035
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,960
Go ahead. Take off.

1036
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,360
-Smack me if I'm wrong--
-Big Time!

1037
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,800
So you want me to talk
to your pops, man?

1038
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,720
He's stressing you out, I see.

1039
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,400
I'll talk to him, man. I'll handle him.
Just give me the word.

1040
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,320
I can handle my own
business, all right?

1041
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,040
Yeah? You can handle it?
All right, J-man, handle it.

1042
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,160
You know, your pops,
bugged out as he is right now,

1043
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,640
back in the day,
he could play some ball, yeah.

1044
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,080
Did you know that? Huh?
Did you know that?

1045
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,520
-He knows.
-Yeah. Let's slide off to A.C., J-man.

1046
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,920
-What's up, Jesus!
-Atlantic City, my treat.

1047
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,200
-We got school.
-J-man.

1048
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,120
-A.C.--
-Like my cousin said, we got school.

1049
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,040
Right. My bad, my bad.

1050
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,680
Hey, can't be fucking with
y'all's education, right? Yeah.

1051
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,320
-So where you going to school, man?
You made up your mind?
-Not yet.

1052
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,440
Look, you pygmy motherfucker--

1053
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,720
-I'm not a pygmy.
-You want to walk to school?

1054
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,360
Big Time, it's cool.

1055
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,800
I'll kick your ass
out to the curb right now.

1056
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,560
I mean, my bad and all, my bad,

1057
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,200
but don't make me get violent
early in the morning.

1058
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,560
-Really. I ain't had my coffee.
-Be cool, all right?

1059
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,560
You know it's no coincidence
motherfuckers don't be fucking
with you, right?

1060
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,440
Starting beefs with you,
starting shit with you.

1061
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,600
You know.

1062
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,080
-As jealous as niggers is
around here, like that nigger.
-Jesus!

1063
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,400
Look, the reason
why nobody...

1064
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,120
fucks with you is 'cause Big Time Willie
put the word out, all right?

1065
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,320
-Oh, you did?
-Big Time Willie told motherfuckers...

1066
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,800
they be fucking with the J,

1067
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,400
they're going to wake up dead
in the Atlantic Ocean.

1068
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,840
Look, I hate to break it
down to you this way,

1069
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,120
but it's not 'cause
they love you, man.

1070
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,241
Huh? The bigger a nigger get up in this
motherfucker, the more they hate you.

1071
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,640
All right? I mean,
you can play ball and all that,

1072
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,080
but, shit, that don't mean shit
to these niggers 'round here;
put a cap in your ass.

1073
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,800
Just on G.P. That's on the strength.
So you got to watch your back.

1074
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,560
-Oh, so I should thank you then, huh?
-I don't give a fuck.

1075
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,920
I just want you to know
what the tick-tock is.

1076
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,840
He knows.

1077
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,720
Yeah.

1078
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,120
You know, a lot of great ballplayers
came out of Coney Island,

1079
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,520
but most of them
didn't amount to shit.

1080
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,000
-What about Stephon Marbury?
He made it.
-Oh, true that, true that.

1081
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,200
-Yeah, but he's one of the few.
-If he can make it out here, so can l.

1082
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,080
-Yeah? You're going to make it?
-Yeah, I'm going to make it.

1083
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,560
You're going to make it out like the rest
of these niggers out here, in a casket.

1084
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,280
First thing that's going to take you out
is these drugs they got for you.

1085
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,880
And you got the cocaine,
heroin, crack cocaine.

1086
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,280
You got the uppers, the downers,
the chiva, crystal meth.

1087
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,360
Acid.
We got the nicotine for you.

1088
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,480
Huh? You don't want
none of that?

1089
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,360
And don't forget about
the alcohol, baby.

1090
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,160
Yeah, we got that malt liquor,
a.k.a. "liquid crack."

1091
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,080
Get that motherfucker.

1092
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,480
Just for you, black man.

1093
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,480
You see that shit be advertised
up and down Park Avenue?

1094
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,520
Fuck, no!

1095
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,440
Why do you fuck with me,
you fucking bitches?

1096
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,160
I keep telling y'all,
stop fucking with me.

1097
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,160
Oh, and they got the other
thing for you, man.

1098
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,320
Yeah, I almost forgot.


1099
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,240
They got that pussy.

1100
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,240
-Give it to me, James.
-Take it.

1101
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,240
I know you know how to
spell that, don't you?

1102
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,160
-I do.
-How you spell it?

1103
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,920
-P-U-S--
-H.I.V.

1104
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,080
-Oh, baby, fuck me hard.
-Look at them come.

1105
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,760
He think 'cause he got that ball skill,
he going up in the N.B.A., he immune.

1106
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,480
How you going to be immune to pussy?
Pussy be talking to you, Jesus.

1107
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,400
Pussy be saying,
pussy be saying,

1108
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,320
"Come on in, Jesus.
Just a little taste."

1109
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,960
How you going to be immune
to that shit?

1110
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,680
-Feel so good.
-All that titty up in your face.

1111
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,080
All that good ass.
How you going to be immune to that thigh?

1112
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,480
All those lips, all those hips?
All those honey dips?

1113
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,800
Come on, man. Be real.

1114
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,160
That shit will fuck
a nigger up quick.

1115
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,960
Deadly combination.
You know what I'm saying?

1116
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,760
And I didn't even mention
the bloodsucking leeches.

1117
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,720
Oh, yeah.

1118
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,960
The newfound family.

1119
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,760
Pygmy buzzards be hovering over you
trying to get that loose change.

1120
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,960
You know what I'm saying?
Huh?

1121
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,600
They talking about "l love you."
"Oh, I love you."

1122
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,560
-I love you.
-Oh, I love you, Jesus. Oh, I love you.

1123
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,840
-You know I love you.
-I love you.

1124
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,320
Te amo. Jess, te amo.
Aye, qu fiebre.

1125
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,520
Come on, man.

1126
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,480
-I love you so much.
-I need some money.

1127
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,680
-Hook a brother up.

1128
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,200
I need some cash.
I'm going to get these Nikes.

1129
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,640
-I can't have anything but the best.
-This Hilfiger sweater--

1130
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,600
-Don't you want me looking good for you?

1131
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,280
-I love you.
-Hook a sister up. I need some money.

1132

1141
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,480
-Goddamn, man!
-Good block, baby.

1142
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,160
-Ball out, man.
-What?

1143
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,000
-What you mean, what?
You fouled the fuck out of me.
-That was our ball!

1144
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,920
You fouled me. It's the only way
you're going to block my shot anyway.

1145
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,840
You fouled me, you fouled me.
Boo-hoo!

1146
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,560
-Always crying.
-You the crybaby, you little
church-going motherfucker.

1147
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,320
That's why I don't like
playing with your ass, son.

1148
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,960
You swear you Jordan up in this piece.
You foul motherfuckers too.

1149
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,640
-Man, shut your--
-Fuck the call.

1150
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,040
-Give me the damn ball!
-Here, you want the ball?

1151
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,160
Go get it!

1152
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,080
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit.

1153
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,240
-Yo, I made that shit.
-That's a million-dollar shot, baby.

1154
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,800
-Goddamn!
-Jesus!

1155
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,040
-Coach is back.
-I need to see you in my office now.

1156
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,280
-So what's up, Coach?
-You know, I don't want
to keep busting your balls,

1157
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,480
but you got any idea where you're
going to go with this thing?

1158
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,600
I mean, kid,
an inkling, anything?

1159
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,000
-Naw, I don't know yet.
-You're not holding out on me, are you?

1160
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,840
No, Coach, you know I wouldn't do that
to you. I just don't know yet.

1161
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,040
I'll know on Monday morning.
I still have to weigh my options.

1162
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,480
Do me a favour.
Go lock the door.

1163
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,400
Lock the door.

1164
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,920
-Sit down.
-What's that?

1165
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,200
Sit down, Jesus.
Sit down.

1166
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,960
It's, uh--it's a little
package to help you...

1167
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,360
-maybe make your decision before Monday.
-I don't need that.

1168
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,760
Buddy, you know what this is?

1169
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,920
-What?
-That's $10,000.

1170
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,240
Huh? Take it.
10,000 "braziuls."

1171
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,200
Hey, hey, you know how much
Hilfiger this buys?

1172
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,520
Come on.

1173
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,440
It's yours. Don't be
afraid of it. Take it.

1174
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,640
-I can't take that.
-What do you mean? You been taking it.

1175
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,840
-I can't take it.
-You've been taking, kid.

1176
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,280
You told me before that it was
just a loan, didn't you?

1177
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,120
You're talking semantics here.

1178
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,440
Jesus, the fact remains, you took
the do-re-mi, pal. Think back with me.

1179
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,880
You remember that little problem
you had with Calculus?

1180
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,160
You remember the grade
you couldn't get?

1181
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,960
Coach bumped that up a bit for you.
You passed the course, didn't you?

1182
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,600
-Yeah.
-Your "dusanikbats" uncle.
You had to get out of his house.

1183
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,120
Within one week, a truck came and
moved you and your kid sister out.

1184
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,360
I ever bring that up?

1185
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,440
Never a word out of me.
Always there for you.

1186
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,360
Am I lying? Come on, kid.

1187
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,280
Come on, please, will you?

1188
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,520
I'm not asking you to commit a homicide
here. I'm asking you to just give me...

1189
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,480
a little bit of information.
I need something--anything.

1190
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,400
I ain't got nothing
to say, Coach.

1191
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,760
When I was a kid, my mother used to
go, "Arthur, you're a capo tost."

1192
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,920
-You know what a "capo tost" is?
-Naw.

1193
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,840
It means you got a head
like concrete.

1194
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,920
I think me and you, we suffer from
the same affliction. I swear to God.

1195
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,120
Kid, on the court, you're the most
coachable kid I ever had.

1196
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,040
I never had a boy
that could respond like you.

1197
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,200
Off the court,
I can't tell you a damn thing.

1198
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,360
This is your money.
Hey, this is yours.

1199
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,720
-I don't need that money, Coach.
-Tell me something.

1200
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,640
I got Calculus.

1201
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,640
You forgot something.

1202
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,000
Yeah.

1203
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,200
Mm, right there.

1204
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,280
Oh, yeah.

1205
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,000
-Mr. Shuttlesworth, how are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?

1206
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,480
-Dom Pagnotti. Pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1207
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,400
-Hello, Lala.
-Hello.

1208
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,520
-D'Andre, what's up?
-How you doing?

1209
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,280
-Why don't we go inside?
I'll show you my house.
-We'd love to.

1210
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,800
-Wow. This a phat crib.
-Ain't it?

1211
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,040
-What do you think?
-You have a really nice home.

1212
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,440
Thank you. I just did it.
Built it from scratch.

1213
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,360
-It's gorgeous.
-Thank you.

1214
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,520
Why don't you and Lala make
yourself at home and let me
and Jesus discuss some business.

1215
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,640
This right here
is a 355 Ferrari Spider, $130,000.

1216
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,480
You're looking at
a 12-cylinder Mercedes, 600 SL--

1217
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,400
$135,000.

1218
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,840
Now, if you want the best,
Jesus, you come right this way.

1219
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,880
A quarter-million-dollar
Lamborghini Diablo.

1220
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,800
-Take a look inside, Jesus.
-You can get a house
with a quarter million dollars.

1221
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,720
Not the house
I'm going to get you.

1222
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,640
-You like music?
-I love music.

1223
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,200
-Has a $30,000 stereo system.
State of the art.
-$30,000?

1224
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,200
30,000. That's a small trailer home
in North Carolina...

1225
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,280
you got playing music
for you right there.

1226
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,200
Now, Jesus,
I know you like Lala.

1227
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,800
Whatever may be may be.
But you can look like Buddy Hackett...

1228
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,560
and drive down a street with this
and have 40 girls chasing you.

1229
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,520
I want to show you my court.

1230
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,920
Oh, so you just got the court
built inside the house, huh?

1231
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,960
-Of course.
-Let's go one-on-one.

1232
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,920
-Let's see what you got.
-What I got?

1233
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,840
-Let's see what you got.
-I got--

1234
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,320
So you in the Mafia.
Down with Gotti, huh?

1235
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,320
Mafia? Gotti?

1236
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,120
Just because I'm an Italian American
doesn't mean I'm involved with the mob.

1237
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,720
I'm the best at what I do.
I'm a sports agent.

1238
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,680
Now, I don't know
if you realize this,

1239
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,680
but several NBA teams
are interested in you right now.

1240
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,600
At this point in time,
I can't tell you who,

1241
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,560
but I will tell you
they are contenders.

1242
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,200
Now, I know you've considered
jumping straight to the pros.

1243
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,640
The money is there.

1244
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,200
I have the contacts.
So apply for the NBA draft now.

1245
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,880
Right here, Jesus,
is a contract.

1246
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,800
This makes me your agent.

1247
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,720
This allows me
to represent you.

1248
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,360
I will take you to the top.

1249
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,800
I can't do that right now.
I have to weigh my options.

1250
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,040
-How much does your watch cost?
-89.95.

1251
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,720
89.95. Right here...

1252
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,320
is a platinum
and diamond Rolex.

1253
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,960
The best you can buy.

1254
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,240
Gold? Forget about it.
Silver? Forget about it.

1255
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,880
You have platinum and diamonds. That's
like having speed and power in the NBA.

1256
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,240
And, Jesus, that watch is a gift
from Dom Pagnotti to you.

1257
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,600
-Keep it.
-Oh, I bet there's strings
attached, too, huh?

1258
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,680
There's no strings, no rubber bands.
There's nothing attached at all.

1259
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,120
That's a $36,000 watch. That's like
having a Corvette on your wrist.

1260
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,840
-You keep that.
-I can't take this.

1261
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,080
-Why not?
-It's illegal. I can't take it.

1262
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,360
I don't see anyone here.
Just me and you.

1263
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,680
-There's nobody here,
but it's still illegal.
-You know what, Jesus?

1264
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,120
I'll keep it. The money
you and I going to make together,

1265
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,560
you could buy 20 of them
if you want.

1266
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,720
Yeah, that's all good
and everything, but when I'm ready,

1267
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:51,520
-I'm thinking about hiring
a brother to represent me.
-Yeah? Why's that?

1268
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,440
I just feel comfortable
with a brother.

1269
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,000
All right, Jesus,
let me ask you a question.

1270
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,240
-What color is this?
-It's green.

1271
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,160
You're black, I'm white,
this is green.

1272
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:05,440
When making a business decision,
the only color that matters is green.

1273
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,400
Now, do you consider yourself
a man or a boy?

1274
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,400
-Of course I consider myself a man.
-Okay.

1275
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,960
Because men make decisions
with their mind.

1276
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,520
Boys make decisions
with their heart, Jesus.

1277
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,520
-My partner D'Andre, he's black.
-No!

1278
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,440
So it really doesn't matter.

1279
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,040
You have the best
of both worlds.

1280
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,160
You need to sign with me,
and you need to sign with me now.

1281
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,560
-You talk a great game.
-Jesus, this isn't a game. This is life.

1282
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,760
I can bring you
to the Promised Land,

1283
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,560
but what you need to do, Jesus,
is give me the opportunity...

1284
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,560
to show you how good I am.

1285
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,440
Dear Jesus,
your daddy and I hope you're fine.

1286
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,360
"l thought it might be
a little hard for you...

1287
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,160
"being away from home for--
for the first time.

1288
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,080
I had no idea that--"

1289
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,000
I didn't even know
they had basketball camps.

1290
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,880
Thank God I got you out of Coney Island
for at least a week this summer.

1291
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,680
"You're really serious
about this basketball,

1292
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,600
and that's good."

1293
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,160
However, I do wonder sometimes...

1294
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,840
whether it's you or your father
that wants to pursue this.

1295
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,000
I know he drives you
too hard.

1296
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,960
That's right. Come on,
come on. Work, baby.

1297
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,880
You got to work harder
than the next man, right?

1298
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,480
It's the will of the man;
it ain't the skill of the man.

1299
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,720
He can't play you.
He can't do nothing with you!

1300
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,400
We the only two people up. Me, you and
Michael Jordan. That's the only people.

1301
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,320
Everybody else in the world is asleep.

1302
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,480
What you think Jordan doing right now?
He lifting weights right now.

1303
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,920
We out the projects, baby.
We out the projects.

1304
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,520
Where we going to live at, son? Where
we living at, yo? Where we living at?

1305
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,800
Huh? We living on East Side.
Where we at?

1306
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,080
We're up on the Upper West Side?
Central Park West somewhere?

1307
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,480
-Where we going to be at, huh?
What you going to buy Mama, son?
-House.

1308
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,400
Come on.
A big house, right?

1309
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,360
How many bedrooms?
How many bedrooms?

1310
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,320
-How many she want?
-As many as she wants.

1311
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,520
Don't never let them see you weak.
Let me tell you something.

1312
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,800
-Don't never let them see you weak.
-This is for everything.

1313
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,040
You miss, you know
you giving me ten pushups, right?

1314
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,760
You know if you miss, you
give me ten pushups, right?

1315
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,680
-All right, show me what you got.

1316
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,360
Concentrate.

1317
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,120
Four... three... two--

1318
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,240
That's what I'm talking about. That's
what I'm talking about. Are you tired?

1319
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,640
Jesus Shuttlesworth, he got game.
He don't get tired.

1320
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,960
-Are you tired? You tired?
-Uh-huh.

1321
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,280
"But, son, your father
does love you dearly."

1322
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,280
-You should have seen your boy today.
-What did he do?

1323
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,160
-What'd you get them for, son?
-About 34 points.

1324
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,080
-Thirty-four.
-Thirty-four points?

1325
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,680
You got 34, but one time
he went up, I was like, "Oh, my boy."

1326
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,920
-I thought he was going to dunk.
He just kept going.
-Really?

1327
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,400
He kept going. He's almost getting the
rim now, or the net, anyway--the net.

1328
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,400
-That's my baby.
-That's right. My boy.

1329
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,320
"Have fun at the camp,
and remember--"

1330
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,080
Use basketball as a tool.

1331
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,120
"Love, Mommy."

1332
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,160
"P.S.--Your sister
misses you badly."

1333
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,960
And when you get home,
please be nice to her.

1334
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,440
Big brothers have to protect
their little sisters.

1335
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,360
Come on, baby.

1336
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,240
-Don't hold back, baby.
-Oh, oh, yeah, oh.

1337
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,920
No, baby, come on. Don't hold back.

1338
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Come on, baby.

1339
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,920
Oh, yeah, baby.
Fuck me now.

1340
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,800
Fuck me. Oh, yeah.

1341
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,040
Yeah. Come on, baby.

1342
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,520
Come on, baby, come on.
Fuck me, baby.

1343
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,480
Where them elbows at?
Give me the elbows. Make me pay for it.

1344
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,400
Make me pay if I get too close.
Make me pay!

1345
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:24,560
Yes. All right,
good shoot! Oh!

1346
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,480
-All right.
-All right, that's two.

1347
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,440
-Two-zip.
-Two-zip.

1348
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,240
I'll give you ten.

1349
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,880
He's cheating, Jesus.

1350
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,160
Come on now. Play ball.

1351
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,120
Just 'cause a man bigger than you,
don't mean he better than you.

1352
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,960
Whoo-hoo!

1353
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,320
Play some "D" now.

1354
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,240
Get up on him, Jesus.

1355
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,080
Money.
What's that, baby?

1356
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,800
-Ask Goose.
-What was that, ten-one?

1357
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,960
-Ten-two? Butter.
-Luck.

1358
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,880
You ain't ready for me.

1359
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,800
Come on, Jesus.
Get up on him, Jesus.

1360
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,000
-Check it out.
-Check them.

1361
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,520
-Don't push me.
-So what I push you? So what?

1362
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,480
You're going to get mad
when you get pushed?

1363
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,560
What, you want to quit
when you get pushed?

1364
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,520
-Oh!
-Take your shot.

1365
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,720
I could take you out
your game that easy, huh?

1366
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,720
So somebody gets up on you.
So what?

1367
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,680
-Stop pushing him, man.
-You got to deal with that, son.

1368
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,880
You mad? That's all the players got
to do to you, is make you mad, huh?

1369
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,280
All they got to do is make you mad
and you'll give up, won't you?

1370
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,240
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't play.

1371
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,240
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't make a shot.

1372
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,120
Come get it now.
I ain't taking it easy on you.

1373
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,280
I told you I ain't taking it easy
on you. Where you at, boy?

1374
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,360
J-J, come on,
give the guy a break, man.

1375
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,720
Come on,
go strong, Jesus.

1376
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,640
-Why you cheating, man?
-How did I cheat?

1377
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,080
-Don't tell me how to raise my son.
-Stop pushing me.

1378
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,800
So I'm pushing you. So what?
Show me what you got.

1379
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,240
Stop pushing me.

1380
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,160
-Take it! Take it!
-Go strong, baby.

1381
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,240
-Like nobody's better than you!
-I'm supposed to be scared?

1382
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,320
Yes. That's what
I'm talking about.

1383
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,920
No matter what I say to you, I ain't
got nothing to do with your game.

1384
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,840
It's between you
and the rim.

1385
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,760
Don't be afraid of nobody.
That's right.

1386
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,000
Elbow me if--
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1387
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,200
-Go strong.
-Get out of here.

1388
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,160
Go get it, the ball.
Go get it.

1389
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,720
-Whoa, whoa.
-Get up.

1390
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,560
-Foul, man!
-All right, you got foul. No harm.

1391
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:25,240
Respect my call. Besides, that wasn't
a foul. That was attempted murder!

1392
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,480
What you mean, respect your call?
Ain't nobody even hardly touch you.

1393
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,120
-What you trying to prove?
-Just get up, boy, and stop
crying. Give me the ball.

1394
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,280
-Give me the ball, man.
-What you doing?

1395
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,760
-Check it out--
-Hey, respect my call.

1396
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:38,200
-Besides, that wasn't a foul--
-Don't start yelling at me, boy.

1397
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,560
No harm. No foul.
Are you hurt? You bleeding?

1398
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,160
What you think? I want to see
you get pushed like that. Ow!

1399
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,160
-You going to cry now or something?
-Why you got to push--Whoa!

1400
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,680
-Take the ball out. Huh?
-Man, I quit, man.

1401
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,120
-Man, I quit!
-You quit?

1402
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,960
-What?
-I quit. I'm out of here.

1403
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,200
Oh, you out of here now. You're
going to quit like a little bitch, huh?

1404
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,560
Big bitch!

1405
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,680
You better go
and get my ball!

1406
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,560
-I ain't getting a damn thing!
-Jesus!

1407
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,560
-Daddy, leave me alone!
-Jake, that's some wrong shit, man.

1408
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,640
I'm out of here, man.

1409
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,080
Fuck, that's why
he ain't going to make it.

1410
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,720
That's why he
ain't going to make it.

1411
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,480
Damn, I can't believe he threw
that shit over the fence.

1412
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,440
What's the matter, baby?
You don't like the food.

1413
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,760
The food is fine.
Just not hungry.

1414
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,200
-Where's your daddy?
-I don't know, and I don't care.

1415
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,000
Uncle Jake must have beat him
in basketball again. Ow!

1416
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,120
-Stop hitting on him.
-Tell him to stop then. He
always getting on my nerves.

1417
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,040
No, I'm not going
to tell him to shut up,

1418
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,320
and these basketball wars between
you and your father have got to stop.

1419
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,960
I just asked your son
where you were.

1420
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,040
Don't they feed you
at home, Booger?

1421
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,960
How you doing, baby?

1422
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,760
Your food was getting cold,
so I put it in the oven.

1423
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,280
You know, when you threw that ball
over the fence, it got lost.

1424
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,320
You know that, right?

1425
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,720
Paid my hard-earned money for that
basketball. You know that, don't you?

1426
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,720
We can always buy
a new basketball.

1427
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,040
Yeah, we don't need
a new ball, okay?

1428
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,960
We had a ball already.

1429
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,040
Besides, you need to learn how
to respect other people's property.

1430
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,360
Ball belonged to me,
not to him.

1431
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,480
-Mommy, can I be excused?
-No, you cannot. Sit your ass down.

1432
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,840
-I'm finished!
-Yeah, well, you ain't excused though.

1433
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,400
-He's done, Jake.
-I ain't done. Sit your black ass down.

1434
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,200
And it's time for you to go.
And put the bread back down.

1435
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,840
-Trying to sneak bread all the time.
-Bye, Jesus!

1436
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,800
I said sit down. I'm your daddy
and you're going to do what I tell you.

1437
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,720
Don't raise your voice.

1438
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,160
Do what I tell you to do,
and I'm telling you to sit down.

1439
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,240
-So? I'm finished.
-What?

1440
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,120
-You hear what I say to you, huh?
-Jake!

1441
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,640
-Boy, when I tell you to sit down--
-Get off me!

1442
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,080
-When I tell you to sit down--
-Jake, get off him!

1443
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,680
-Get up off me!
-Get off him! What's wrong with you?

1444
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,520
Are you out of your mind?

1445
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,760
Stop it! Please!

1446
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,640
Baby?

1447
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:45,880
-Mommy? Mommy?
-Baby?

1448
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,640
-Get up. Get up.
-Wake up, baby.

1449
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,240
Baby, wake up.
Call 9-1-1, son.

1450
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,800
Call 9-1-1. Go ahead.
Call 9-1-1. Go, go.

1451
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,120
Come on, let's walk.

1452
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,280
I knew you was going to come though.
I appreciate it, though, son.

1453
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,680
Yeah, I appreciate you for coming
to meet me and everything like that.

1454
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:55,560
I got this for Mary here. You know,
I thought she might like these here.

1455
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,240
My all-time favourite ballplayer
was Earl Monroe.

1456
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,600
Earl the Pearl.

1457
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,360
Yeah, he was nice. See, everybody
remember him from the Knicks,

1458
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,480
you know, when he helped win
that second championship.

1459
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,560
I'm talking about when he was with the
Bullets down at Winston-Salem Stadium...

1460
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,200
before that game, with 42 points
a game the whole season.

1461
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,160
41.6...

1462
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,840
the whole season.

1463
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,600
But the Knicks, they put the shackles on
him, man, you know, on his whole game.

1464
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,840
They locked him up,
like in a straitjacket or something.

1465
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:34,120
When he was in the streets of Philly,
the playgrounds,

1466
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,320
he was like--

1467
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,000
-You know what they called him?
-What?

1468
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,800
Jesus. That's what they called him--
Jesus. 'Cause he was the truth.

1469
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,600
Then the white media got a hold of it.
Then they got to call him Black Jesus.

1470
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,000
He can't just be Jesus.
He got to be Black Jesus.

1471
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,800
You know, but still...
he was the truth.

1472
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,560
So that's the real reason
why you got your name.

1473
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,440
You named me Jesus after Earl Monroe,
and not Jesus in the Bible?

1474
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,280
Not Jesus of the Bible,
Jesus of North Philadelphia.

1475
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,640
Jesus of the playgrounds.
That's the truth, son.

1476
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,880
The way he dished, the way
he, you know, he spinned.

1477
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,040
You know how you do,
coming off and all that. Taw!

1478
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,640
I want you to go
to Big State, son.

1479
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,520
That's the real reason
why I'm out here.

1480
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,240
That's the reason
they let me out.

1481
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,600
You find it in your heart to go
to Big State, and, uh...

1482
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,440
they may let me out
on an early parole.

1483
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,360
-So that's what this is all about, huh?
-That's a part of it.

1484
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,600
-Jake, you just like everybody else.
-I ain't like everybody else.

1485
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:52,000
I ain't like everybody else.
Everybody else ain't your father.

1486
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,920
Everybody else ain't
bring you in this world.

1487
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,320
Everybody else don't care
about you, son.

1488
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,880
Like that girl you running with.
You know her, Lay--Layla?

1489
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,800
-Lala!
-Lala. You know her?

1490
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,320
-Yeah, I know her.
-Yeah, she know you like a book too.

1491
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:08,000
Many a great man, son,
their downfall was 'cause of a woman.

1492
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,080
-You talking about Samson and Delilah.
-Yeah, that's right.

1493
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,600
Him too. Him too.
You see I don't cut my hair, right?

1494
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,120
So you do know
your Bible, huh?

1495
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:22,560
Look, son, just be careful.
That's all I'm saying to you, all right?

1496
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,640
All right?

1497
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,800
Do you know if you're
going to go to Big State?

1498
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,520
I mean, is that like a finalist,
or the final four for you?

1499
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,080
-They are in my top ten.
-In your top ten?

1500
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,480
All right. That's good.
One out of ten, that's--

1501
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,640
I can live with them odds.

1502
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,240
-What's up, Booger?
-Hi, Uncle Jake.

1503
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,160
All right, I'm, uh--

1504
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,000
Just give that to Mary.

1505
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,560
-What's up, Booger?
-What's up?

1506
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
She knows it's only a treat.

1507
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,720
She doesn't get it all the time.
Just once in a while.

1508
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,560
Aww.

1509
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,480
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1510
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,680
-Man, thank God it's Friday.
-Friday?

1511
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:25,280
You better thank God
you're here, man.

1512
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,360
I'm just glad you was able
to make it, man.

1513
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,440
Sorry it was
so last-minute though.

1514
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,720
Man, don't be crazy, man.
I know all the schools sweating you.

1515
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,080
-How many you visit?
-Four.

1516
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,480
You going to take the extra
ten they gave you?

1517
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,880
-You know I don't need no ten visits.
-Yeah, right.

1518
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,040
Hi, Chick.

1519
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,960
-That was my last one.
-Yeah?

1520
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,080
Who was that?
She was sweating you.

1521
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,200
You like this?
You like this, don't you?

1522
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,240
-Yeah, it's really nice.
-Yeah, I could tell.

1523
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,640
This ain't the projects, man. We got
like grass and trees, and fresh air.

1524
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,560
This is Morgan.
This is Monty.

1525
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,480
-How you doing?
-How you doing, Jesus?

1526
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,640
-We'll check you later.
-Later on. Them boys can play, man.

1527
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,600
What's up, Chick? Hey, Chick.

1528
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,520
Hey, girls, how you doing?

1529
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,440
-Hey.
-Oh, man.

1530
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,360
Mm!

1531
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,400
Goodness. I know the both
of y'all know Jesus Shuttlesworth.

1532
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

1533
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,480
That's not right, Chick.
That's not right, Chick.

1534
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,440
Hey, how about Sunday?
Take y'all out of church?

1535
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,960
-Wait. You're Jesus of Coney Island?
-Yeah, that's me.

1536
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,040
Look, you've got to come
to this school.

1537
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,560
With you and Chick, we'll
definitely go to the Final Four.

1538
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,520
-Go? We'll win the whole thing.
-That's you, dog.

1539
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,600
-You are going to go here, aren't you?
-Well, we hope so.

1540
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,520
It's my job to convince him.

1541
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,600
And this is his last
visit to any schools.

1542
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,680
-Jesus, Tech-U is a really cool place.
You will love it here.
-Really?

1543
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,160
-I mean, we really know how to party.
-Oh, you do?

1544
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,240
-Uh-oh.
-It's, uh, really cool.

1545
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,040
-I hope I see you around.
-All right.

1546
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,280
-Bye.
-Bye.

1547
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,840
-Bye, Chick.
-Bye, Chick.

1548
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,600
Come on. Let's go meet
Coach Billy Sunday, man.

1549
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,160
-Forget Billy Sunday.
We need to follow them.
-Man, he's a cool white boy.

1550
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,680
Now this is what I'm
talking about. Tech dome, baby!

1551
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,560
-Wow!
-Thousands of seats. Crowded, yo.

1552
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,880
When they get in here,
they tear the roof off, yo.

1553
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,440
See those seats
down there, man?

1554
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,360
-Yeah?
-The ones in the front.

1555
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,680
That's where all the alumni sit,
with all the money, man.

1556
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,440
-Where? Right here?
-Yeah, man. I even got
my favourite seat, right here.

1557
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,960
Wait. You can sit on mine.
I'm going to warm this one up.

1558
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,040
Feel that?
Feel the difference?

1559
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:27,240
Now, introducing--Number 34!

1560
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:33,160
From Coney Island,
Brooklyn, New York--

1561
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:37,840
Jee-suuus Shuttlesworth!

1562
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,840
Hello, son.
This is for you.

1563
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,280
Coach Sunday.

1564
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,680
I hope that Chick here
has been a gracious host.

1565
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,800
Oh, Chick has been great.

1566
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,640
Good. 'Cause we really know how
to treat our student athletes right.

1567
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,160
-Isn't that right, Chick?
-Yeah, oh, yeah.

1568
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,120
Coach is telling
the truth, man.

1569
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:34,080
I hope you don't think we're too forward
or aggressive with the highlight film...

1570
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,040
-or the jersey.
-No way.

1571
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,800
-That's the way we are here
at Tech U. We show love.
-Much love. Much love.

1572
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,240
Why beat around the bush?

1573
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,760
We scouted you since you were
in junior high school.

1574
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,440
We know all about you.
We love you.

1575
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:51,000
You're a great kid. Not only a
great ballplayer, a great student,

1576
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,240
but a beautiful human being.

1577
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,080
When I read about how you've been
raising your sister all by yourself,

1578
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,360
it made me want to cry.

1579
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,760
I said to myself,
"That's the kind of young man...

1580
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,280
"that will be the backbone
of this great country,

1581
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,840
-not just the Tech University
basketball team."
-Tell it.

1582
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,000
-You understand what I'm trying to say?
-Yes, sir.

1583
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,960
When I heard...
that you were coming to visit,

1584
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,440
I got down...
on my hands and knees...

1585
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,600
and I prayed to God.

1586
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,120
-Chick.
-Right here.

1587
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,320
-Dear Lord, please...
-Please.

1588
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,320
deliver Jesus to us.

1589
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:43,200
I got down on my knees,
and I asked God...

1590
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,480
to let Tech University
be the throne of Jesus.

1591
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,440
As you already know, this will be
the most important decision...

1592
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,640
of your life
that you'll ever make.

1593
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,120
Yeah.

1594
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:59,600
Son... don't blow it.

1595
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,760
-Hi, Chick. How you doing?
-Hey, what's up, Molly?

1596
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,080
-Hey, Chick.
-What's up, Liz?

1597
01:30:03,161 --> 01:30:06,280
-This is Jesus Shuttlesworth.
-Hi, Jesus.

1598
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,240
-We're glad you're here.
-We're having a little talk.

1599
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:13,920
Let us finish, and then we can
get up with y'all later. All right?

1600
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,400
Okay. All right.
Nice meeting you.

1601
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,320
-Bye.
-Nice seeing y'all.

1602
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,640
Mm!

1603
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,040
Lovely, huh?
Travel in packs too.

1604
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,680
Mm!

1605
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,880
You hit those?

1606
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,760
-About 50% from the field.
-You lying.

1607
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,081
You can have the rest.
I swear. Look, man.

1608
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,720
We got some serious freaks
up here in this piece, man.

1609
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,960
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh, Jesus.

1610
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,240
I was into my black bag
also, man.

1611
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,800
Yo, I was keeping beautiful,
fine dark sisters.

1612
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:51,120
Nubian sisters. Africa.
The whole nine. I'm telling you, man.

1613
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,480
Well, you know,
I got a lady back in Brooklyn.

1614
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,960
-Her name is Lala. We in love.
-I got a lady too.

1615
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,880
She at home,
and she ain't here.

1616
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,960
And I ain't talking about no love.
I'm talking about...

1617
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,040
these white freaks
here at Tech U, man.

1618
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,040
They love some ball-playing
brothers, man.

1619
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,480
-Let you get your swerve on, man.
-I hear all that, but--

1620
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,680
-What about the sisters?
-What about them?

1621
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,600
I love them, but they
make you work too hard, man.

1622
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,280
Them white girls over there, man,
they do your dirty drawers.

1623
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,240
Wash them.
Cook for you.

1624
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,160
-Give you money, man.
-Nuh-uh!

1625
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,360
-Let you drive the Benz
their daddy bought.
-Oh, hell, no!

1626
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,040
-They go the extra mile, man.
-You lying.

1627
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,040
You see Molly
over there, man?

1628
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,800
You can call her up at 4:00
in the morning, man.

1629
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
"Bitch, get over here.
Let me spank you."

1630
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,600
Man, before you hang the phone up,
she beating on the door.

1631
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,400
-You don't even got
to kick your own bed out.
-Man, you lying.

1632
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,040
-Buck!
-What's up, Buck?

1633
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,480
-Peace, bro! Peace.
-What's up, man?

1634
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,040
-We need to stay out in the hallway.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1635
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,680
-Everybody in the hallway.
-This is a party. It's a long hallway.

1636
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,720
You're good. Hey, where
the hell you at last night?

1637
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,800
Always messing around.
That's why I can't mess with y'all, man.

1638
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,880
-We need to be out here.
-Don't worry about that.

1639
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,960
I want you meeting
the assistant coaches.

1640
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,840
-What are the assistant coaches
doing in the hallway?
-Yeah. Right here, man.

1641
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,880
Lines and choruses
Days full of Doris's

1642
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,480
Jesus, say hello
to Buffy and Suzie.

1643
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,280
-Don't worry about the names.
-What's up?

1644
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,920
Boy. I know you'll
take care of business.

1645
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,240
Brooklyn is in the house.

1646
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,200
Boy, keep it real.
Keep it real. It's up to you.

1647
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,760
-Do what a black man got to do.
-Where you going?

1648
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,840
-Be right out here.
-You leaving?

1649
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,560
Holler if you need me, man.

1650
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:26,920
Hey there.

1651
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
-Sit down. Relax.
-Hi.

1652
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,040
-Yeah. Sit down right here.
-Don't be nervous.

1653
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,320
Beats in the game of rap, put my soul
in it, care less about the gold in it

1654
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,120
Boom the shottie
Got the motherfucking paparazzi

1655
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,520
-How're you doing?
-I'm doing fine.

1656
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,440
-Yeah?
-Yeah. How are you?

1657
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,640
-Good. How do you like your stay so far?
-It's been wonderful.

1658
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,320
He's so nervous.


1659
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,600
He's so tense. Very sexy.

1660
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:54,720
I know. Just can't wait 'til next
season when you're going to school here.

1661
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,560
-Can you?
-I can't wait.

1662
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,800
-I know. Hmm.
-I can't wait.

1663
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,760
Oh, Jesus!

1664
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,560
Yes!

1665
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:11,040
Yes, Jesus! Oh!

1666
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,320
Eat it!

1667
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,240
This guy, he's leaving me now.
He's right there.

1668
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,320
And I'm just going to...
you know, do whatever.

1669
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,080
I'll call you later. I'll call
you later. All right. See you. Bye.

1670
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:45,720
Hey, how you doing? I'm Jake
Shuttlesworth. I'm Jesus' father.

1671
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,120
Yeah, how are you?

1672
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,080
-May I ask you a question,
talk to you about something?
-About what?

1673
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:57,120
Well, number one, my son, he loves you
very much. You know that, right?

1674
01:33:57,161 --> 01:34:01,480
-Yeah. I feel the same way.
-Do you? That's good. That's lovely.

1675
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,000
You haven't talked to him today?
Seen him, nothing like that?

1676
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,160
I was talking to him last night. He told
me that he was heading out of town today.

1677
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,800
I don't remember where he was saying
he was going 'cause I was half-asleep.

1678
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,680
-Nah, I haven't seen him.
-You sure?

1679
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,680
-I haven't seen him.
-Okay.

1680
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,080
Okay. He's waiting for you?

1681
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:22,240
-He's my big brother.
-He's your big brother?

1682
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:27,520
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I can see the resemblance.

1683
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,040
-What are y'all? Dominican? Cuban?
-No.

1684
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,400
-Borinquen, baby, thank you.
-Borinquen. Yeah, whatever.

1685
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,080
-So, like, listen, Layla--
-Lala.

1686
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,560
-Whatever.
-That's my name.

1687
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,440
Whatever they paying you,
I can do better than that.

1688
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,160
Pay whom what? You ain't got
no real money anyway anyhow.

1689
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,521
You ain't got to say that to me.
School's out. You know what I'm saying?

1690
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,440
Here's what I'm saying.
We can help each other, all right?

1691
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,920
You ain't got to play games with me.
Just listen to me for a second.

1692
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,840
We can help each other.

1693
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:55,400
If we work together, we can both get
what we want. You know what I'm saying?

1694
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,280
Look, I don't know who you
been talking to or who you think I am,

1695
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:01,160
but I'm the only one here who really,
really cares about Jesus.

1696
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,760
-Is that right?
-Yes.

1697
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,680
-Why don't you help me then,
since you really care about him?
-No.

1698
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,320
What you need to do is let go of my arm.
Let go of my arm!

1699
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,280
-No disrespect. No disrespect.
-Thank you.

1700
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,480
I think you heard
what she's saying.

1701
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,960
Look, son, why don't you--
What you got there, a Range Rover?

1702
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,040
-"Son"?
-Why don't you get in your Range Rover.

1703
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,280
-You ain't my pops.
-Don't be trying to blow up the spot!

1704
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,241
I'm not trying
to disrespect you--

1705
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:25,200
Huh? I didn't hear what you said.

1706
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,440
-What you say?
-D'Andre!

1707
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,320
-You can't talk now, huh?

1708
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,880
Are you okay?

1709
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,480
D'And--D'Andre?

1710
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,440
What do you want, what do you need
What will you find

1711
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,480
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep
Open your mind

1712
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,760
I hope this rhyme gets you in time
in space, come to a different place

1713
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,960
Will you hear spiritual lyrical
knowledge in your face to face

1714
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,640
Like welfare In these rappers' lyrics
they need health care

1715
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,760
Does KRS represent heaven
Hell, yeah

1716
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,920
Let me take you elsewhere where
you stand is a curse there for sure

1717
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,720
Unless you're mature, grow up

1718
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,120
If you're immature
then you live in sinister

1719
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,280
-Booger. Booger, what's happening?
-Hey, hey.

1720
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,240
-How you doing, man? You all right?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

1721
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,160
-Everything's good?
-Ah, you know, it's all right.

1722
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,560
-Yeah. Seen my son?
-No, I ain't seen him.

1723
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:09,120
-You ain't seen him?
-I ain't seen him.

1724
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,200
Lying motherfucker.
You've seen him. Where he at?

1725
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,200
-You're lying, nigger. Where's he at?
-I'm not lying, Uncle Jake.

1726
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,080
Yeah, all the times you ever been
up eating in my motherfucking house.

1727
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,000
-Where is he at?
-I talked to him yesterday.

1728
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,200
-Where'd he say he was going?
-Yo, yo! Balloons. Two for a dollar.

1729
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,760
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Let go. You're hurting my--

1730
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,320
All right. I'm sorry.
You want some of this here?

1731
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,720
My bad. It's my bad.
You all right? You straight?

1732
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,120
-You got some money?
-No. No.

1733
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,520
Public Enemy on the disk
Unstoppable

1734
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,760
Running the game Chuck and Kris

1735
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,800
-These are good!
-Mm-hmm.

1736
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,840
-I can eat 20 of these.
-Unstoppable Public Enemy on the disk

1737
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,240
Unstoppable
You don't want to take the risk

1738
01:36:45,321 --> 01:36:47,160
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey.

1739
01:36:47,241 --> 01:36:49,120
-How's it going, my man?
-Oh, good, good.

1740
01:36:49,161 --> 01:36:51,081
That's good.
You want a hot dog?

1741
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:54,840
Uh, naw, naw. Yo, uh, Borinquen,
give me one of them orange joints.

1742
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,400
-Okay, you got it.
-Yeah, it's, uh--

1743
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,400
Not as fast as I expected, but it's
all going to work out; I feel that.

1744
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,760
When's your son
coming back into town?

1745
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,680
Y'all heard about that?

1746
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,920
Oh, yeah,
the whole world heard about that.

1747
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,320
-Look, I need some money.
-Mm-hmm.

1748
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,200
You know, an advance or something
like that? I'm broke.

1749
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,080
I hope you're not looking to buy no
plane, train or bus ticket out of here.

1750
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,480
-Naw, nothing like that.
-You're trying to pull a fast one on us?

1751
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,520
-It's just I met a friend.
-Female friend?

1752
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,000
A female friend, and I'd like to take
her someplace other than Nathan's.

1753
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,680
Invite her up for one of them grilled
cheese sandwiches and orange soda.

1754
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,640
Now, I know you haven't fell...

1755
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:32,680
for that broken-down 'ho
you been messing around with.

1756
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,200
-What is a "'ho"?
Is that like a gardening tool?
-'Ho, man. Whore.

1757
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,160
Bitch that sells pussy.
Right, Jake?

1758
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:42,440
She ain't no bitch and she ain't no 'ho.
The lady's name is Dakota. Dakota.

1759
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,880
All right, Jake.
You don't have to get defensive.

1760
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,040
We know you've been locked up
five and a half years. Pussy is pussy.

1761
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:50,600
That's some
hard shit, my man, you know?

1762
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:53,081
No poontang
in five and a half years.

1763
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,400
I know you ain't been out
messing around with them little boys.

1764
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,640
-I ain't messing with no little boys.
-Nobody tossed your salad?

1765
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,720
Ain't nobody did
a motherfucking thing.

1766
01:37:59,801 --> 01:38:02,400
-I read in prison...
-I didn't engage in no
homosexual activities.

1767
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,360
-that the guy who's doing it--
-Y'all going to give me the money?

1768
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,080
Not the guy who's getting it up the
old kazoo, but the guy who's doing it,

1769
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,600
he doesn't consider himself
to be a faggot.

1770
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,720
-Crudup.
-You think that's true?

1771
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,200
Crudup. Just make sure
she's clean, my man.

1772
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:18,080
That could be some dirty-ass pussy.
Go and knock yourself out.

1773
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:20,040
Thank you.

1774
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,000
It's all the film thing,
baby. It's all the film thing.

1775
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,560
You see what I'm saying?
Lights, camera, action!

1776
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,480
All right, Sweetness.
Here we go, baby.

1777
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,400
-I'm making you some money tonight.
-Hey, baby.

1778
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,800
How much for a blow job?
You want to go for a ride?

1779
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,720
You want to have some fun?

1780
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,840
-I want to get my swerve on.
-Want to go out?

1781
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,440
Hey, baby,
you want to party with me tonight?

1782
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,360
This is my last 20 bucks.

1783
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,600
You take that $20
back to your wife, honey.

1784
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:51,280
This is your mama you're talking to.
Come here, baby.

1785
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,600
-Dakota.
-What about you?

1786
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,680
-What?
-Let's get out of here.

1787
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,920
-Will you beat it. Damn!
-Let's get out of here.

1788
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:01,600
-You are bad for business, okay?
-I got money, all right?

1789
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,840
Let's get out of here.

1790
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,600
Hey! What's
in the bag, all right?

1791
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,520
Man!

1792
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,321
Take a seat right there.

1793
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,520
Yeah, huh?
Come on. Sit down.

1794
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,520
Thanks.

1795
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,760
Some of this right there.

1796
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,840
For the lady...

1797
01:39:30,601 --> 01:39:32,640
and for the man.

1798
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:35,520
-Mm, thanks.
-And for the boys upstate.

1799
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,600
-Hey, don't waste it.
-Shit, they need it.

1800
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,200
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1801
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,440
So, um...

1802
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,520
I like talking to you and all,
but don't let that fool you, you know.

1803
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,160
There's no free pussy
around here, no freebies.

1804
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,960
Sweetness will have my ass.

1805
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,160
How much?

1806
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,320
How much you want to spend?

1807
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,480
The whole shot.

1808
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,280
How long have you
been locked up?

1809
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,280
2,213 days.

1810
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,280
That's six years,
23 days...

1811
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,520
in the State.

1812
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,480
Wow.

1813
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,360
How many tricks you turn
in that time?

1814
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,680
-All I count is the money.
-Yeah?

1815
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,280
Why don't you
just pretend like--

1816
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:53,120
like you mean it
or something?

1817
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,000
-I'm a good actress. 
-Are you?

1818
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,080
Yeah.

1819
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,640
Why don't you
take that wig off...

1820
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,920
and be real for a minute.

1821
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,760
I guess that's a requirement
of the job, huh? Right?

1822
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,120
To be a good actress?

1823
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,400
Act like it
means something?

1824
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,560
Hmm?

1825
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,400
Stand up.

1826
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,840
Naw, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1827
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,880
Mmm.

1828
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,640
Go slow.

1829
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,200
It's a long time,
you know?

1830
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,280
Mmm.

1831
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,800
Two thousand.

1832
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,680
Oh, damn.

1833
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,480
Hey, look, why don't we
take this on over there.

1834
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,160
Oh!

1835
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,880
It's okay.

1836
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,120
-It's okay.
-Sorry, l--

1837
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:31,000
No. Nothing
to be sorry about.

1838
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,000
It's been a long time.

1839
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,680
Anyway, we got all night.

1840
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,880
I'm turning the meter off.

1841
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,560
How was your trip, son?

1842
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:08,680
Good.
Whose car is this?

1843
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:11,360
-What, this brand-new Lexus?
-Yeah.

1844
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,280
Well, technically,
it's mine.

1845
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:16,040
It's registered in my name,
but it's for you.

1846
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,120
-For me?
-How you like it?

1847
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:20,160
LS400.

1848
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,720
Look at that.
Power moon roof.

1849
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:25,920
Got that, uh,
vehicle theft deterrent.

1850
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:29,200
That's to deter them Coney Island
Puerto Ricans from stealing your shit.

1851
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,680
I never asked for a car.
Did I ever ask for a car?

1852
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,080
-I asked for you.
-You must be out of your mojo mind.

1853
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,840
If anybody sees me in this car,
that's my ass.

1854
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:42,080
The way it was explained to me, as long
as it's in my name, it's all good.

1855
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,320
This shit
is all fucked up.

1856
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,560
You got to take it back,
give it back, do what you got to do.

1857
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,240
I don't even want to know
who you got it from either.

1858
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,720
You don't like the color?
What you want? Blue, black, white?

1859
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:55,040
-You take it back.
-Sh--

1860
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:18,560
-Mm, so how was your trip?
-My trip? Oh, I had a great trip.

1861
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:21,440
Best one, so far?
You think?

1862
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,320
I don't know. I mean,
they're all the same,

1863
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,200
but you just have a good time
with all of them.

1864
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,880
We all do the same things--go partying,
meet all the guys, go to classes.

1865
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,760
I mean, it was just--
It's off the hook.

1866
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:36,640
-Did you miss me, Jesus?
-Of course I missed you.

1867
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,040
That's all I did
was talk about Lala.

1868
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:44,920
Did you meet any women at the parties,
in the dorms and stuff like that?

1869
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Did I meet any women?

1870
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,600
There were women at this college.
There are women all over the place.

1871
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:53,120
I mean, there's women on the floor,
in the dorms, women in the classroom.

1872
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,240
There's a women's basketball team,
track team. Women all over the place.

1873
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,560
Of course I met women.
I got introduced to everybody.

1874
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,520
I said hello. That's about it.

1875
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,080
-So did you fuck anybody
while you were out there?
-Hell, no!

1876
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:11,080
Don't think I haven't heard stories
about these white college bitches.

1877
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,000
Me with a white bitch?

1878
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,280
They got them all lined up,
waiting to suck your dick.

1879
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,280
If my mother ever saw me with
a white bitch, she'd spin in her grave.

1880
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:21,160
Then she's spinning.
She's turning over and over and over.

1881
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:24,480
Don't be talking about my mother,
all right? Please.

1882
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,960
All right.

1883
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,440
D'Andre and Dom need to know something.

1884
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,120
Goddamn.
I should've known.

1885
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:36,000
-What?
-This whole world is bugged.

1886
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,560
And you're in it with them.
You're in cahoots with D'Andre and Dom.

1887
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:42,800
Don't even lie.
Tell me the truth.

1888
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,720
I knew that ever since
I left that house.

1889
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,200
Ever since I walked in the house,
as a matter of fact.

1890
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,800
And why shouldn't
I get paid, huh?

1891
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,800
Why shouldn't Lala get something
out of this? Everybody else is.

1892
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,440
I can't believe this.
I really can't.

1893
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,360
Well, you believe it.
I believed you when you said...

1894
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,960
that you would never
leave me, Jesus.

1895
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:04,640
And I believed you when you asked me
to get that abortion.

1896
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:06,881
When you begged me
to get that abortion, I believed you.

1897
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:09,720
-We both agreed on that.
-I wanted that child.

1898
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,760
-I wanted to know
what you think because it's--
-What I think?

1899
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,200
A baby's going to hurt
my chance of going to college.

1900
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:20,640
I mean, the top schools,
they're going to be scared away. Damn!

1901
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:25,000
I'm too young. You're too young.
We ain't ready for nothing like this.

1902
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,160
How did we get pregnant anyway?
Let's talk about that.

1903
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,440
Are you sure?

1904
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:32,200
I'm not getting pregnant
now, papi.

1905
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:35,360
I just want to
feel you inside of me...

1906
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,801
without a jimmy.

1907
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,880
"l can't get pregnant, papi.

1908
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,000
I want to feel you
inside of me, papi."

1909
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:50,600
-Isn't that what you said?
-Lala has to look out for herself.

1910
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,520
Lala played herself,
that's what she did.

1911
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,120
And don't think I don't know about
that D'Andre kid either.

1912
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:59,480
-Did you fuck him?
-So what?

1913
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:01,720
At least I can admit it.

1914
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,720
-Oh, so it makes it all right
that you admit it--
-I'm not saying it's all right.

1915
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,280
I'm just saying that there's a reason
and I can at least admit it.

1916
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,320
-That don't mean shit.
-That don't mean shit?

1917
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,240
-Go fuck all of Coney Island.
-Well, you know what?

1918
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,160
If it don't matter,
then why are you stressing?

1919
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,760
-You're going to wake up a whole
bunch of angry black folk.
-I don't give a fuck!

1920
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,680
You know
you're going to leave me.

1921
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,480
This is going to last while you're off
to college for a year?

1922
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:23,040
You want me to live in Lala-land?
Is that what it is?

1923
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,600
How do you know?
Tell me how you know.

1924
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:29,120
-I know 'cause I ain't stupid.
-You went to a fortune teller?

1925
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:31,320
You don't know shit.
You don't know what's going to happen.

1926
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,720
Jesus, I have read
all about...

1927
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,120
those high school sweethearts
who get left behind.

1928
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:40,520
I have seen that movie
many a time.

1929
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:44,640
I told them nobody can tell Jesus
what to do, but they fucking insisted.

1930
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:47,360
If they were stupid enough
to give me money...

1931
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:50,920
to use some kind of influence
over you that I never possessed,

1932
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
so be it.

1933
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,200
They put the money in my hand
with the promise of more to come.

1934
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,440
Just like
everybody else.

1935
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,560
Jesus, you have
no problems.

1936
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,680
Your life is set.
You got no worries.

1937
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,960
-I have nothing.
-Yeah, right.

1938
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,880
You're going to honestly lie
dead to my face and tell me...

1939
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,360
that it was going to be forever
and you were going to take care of me...

1940
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,560
and that I had no problems
or no worries?

1941
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:18,520
-That wasn't hard for me.
-Oh, my God.

1942
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:25,281
Come here.
That's it. Come here!

1943
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:34,120
Good riddance.

1944
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,160
What's up, son?

1945
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:47,560
So, this is it, yo?
Judgement day?

1946
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,920
Father and son?
Jake and Jesus?

1947
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,400
So you ain't going to
say nothing to me. Okay.

1948
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:59,840
I ain't got no more time to be trying
to beg your forgiveness or nothing,

1949
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,280
so I'll make this
real simple.

1950
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:04,160
This right here,
it's a letter of intent...

1951
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:07,040
for you to sign
to go to Big State.

1952
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:08,960
Right?

1953
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,880
Right there.

1954
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,360
I'll play you,
one-on-one, to 11.

1955
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,600
I win, you sign.

1956
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:20,480
You win, you do what you want to do.
Tear it up, whatever.

1957
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,360
I go back to Attica, 'cause I know
that's what you really want. Right?

1958
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,280
-You want to play me one-on-one?
-One-on-one.

1959
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,840
-lf I win, you get the hell out of here?
-I ain't stuttered, son.

1960
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,560
-The hell out of my life?
-Forever.

1961
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,720
-I'll take the bet. You're on.
-Bet.

1962
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,360
You want to take them shines off,
that gold?

1963
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:43,000
You going to take
that LoJack off?

1964
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,840
It don't come off, son.

1965
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,080
Check.

1966
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,840
Aah!

1967
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:02,760
That's one.

1968
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,720
-That's the only basket
you getting all game.
-Check.

1969
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,040
One.

1970
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,960
I can count.
That's one.

1971
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:23,080
Two.

1972
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:25,000
Two-one. That's something
you taught me.

1973
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,081
That's right.
I taught you well, son.

1974
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:30,280
A lot of things you learned from me.
This your ball?

1975
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:33,160
-What you stalling for?
-Everything you got you got from me.

1976
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:35,080
Everything you got.

1977
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:38,440
-Let me show you what you taught me.
-Yeah, show me. Show me!

1978
01:52:39,561 --> 01:52:41,440
Show me!

1979
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,640
I didn't teach you that,
though, did l?

1980
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,560
That's something
I didn't teach you.

1981
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,640
-That was luck.
-That's something you got to
learn on your own.

1982
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,720
Give it up. Give it up.

1983
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:55,080
Oh, why you do--

1984
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,080
Oh, yeah!

1985
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:00,480
Who taught you that one?

1986
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,440
I think I'll go around again.

1987
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:05,920
-Yeah!
-It's your ball.

1988
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,200
Mmm, I feel refreshed.

1989
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:27,320
You better shoot it. That's a brick.

1990
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,040
All right, we gon' cut out
all that lucky shit.

1991
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,040
-What's that?
-That's three.

1992
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:38,400
-You gon' play me?
-Yeah. I'm just warming up, baby.

1993
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,520
I give you that.

1994
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,680
-You better play some defence.
-I give you that.

1995
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,200
Don't give me too many.

1996
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:49,640
Yeah. Where you at, baby?
That's my rock.

1997
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,320
Yeah, that was luck, anyway.

1998
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,680
That's luck too, baby.

1999
01:54:00,761 --> 01:54:02,600
-Just call me the leprechaun.
-That's your last basket.

2000
01:54:02,681 --> 01:54:04,320
Yeah. I'm a lucky Negro.

2001
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,360
You ready?

2002
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:21,800
All right.

2003
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:23,520
Oh, I forgot.

2004
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,200
Payback is a bitch, huh?

2005
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,040
Yeah.

2006
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,240
Oh, don't get mad. You're the one
that taught me to be a good sportsman.

2007
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,040
Ball up.

2008
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,080
What you want,
the jump shot dunk?

2009
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,280
What?

2010
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:54,360
Huh?

2011
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:56,280
-Bottoms.
-What's that?

2012
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:58,760
-Seven to a lucky five.
-Seven to a lucky five.

2013
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,880
-Eight-five.
-Eight-five.

2014
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,280
I'm about to send you
down there with them.

2015
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,440
-Nine-five.
-You quitting?

2016
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,360
-I can take a loss.
-You just gon' give up, huh?

2017
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,280
-I ain't giving up.
-You just gon' give up.

2018
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:20,960
I'm teaching, brother. I'm teaching,
son, like I always taught you.

2019
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:26,080
Oh, you tired?

2020
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,800
Get that out of here.

2021
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,720
You're earning these two.

2022
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,760
Ohh!

2023
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:47,201
I thought you lifted weights
in Attica, in the joint. Huh?

2024
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,440
Point game.
Just play the game.

2025
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,360
Just play the game?

2026
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:54,280
I learned that from you.

2027
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,080
You better "D" up, Jake.

2028
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:02,680
Point game.

2029
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,920
This is your last chance.

2030
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,640
Come on, move away.

2031
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:17,280
Ohh!

2032
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:19,200
Ohh!

2033
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:20,960
Aah!

2034
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,520
Game time.

2035
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,760
What you looking around for?

2036
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,680
That's game--11-5.

2037
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,600
Jake.

2038
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,680
Somebody call a stretcher.

2039
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,920
Stick a fork in him.
He's done.

2040
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:45,560
Take your old ass
back to Attica.

2041
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,680
All right.

2042
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,600
What?

2043
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:06,200
Make you feel like a man now?
Huh?

2044
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:09,560
Maybe you could stop hating me.

2045
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,960
Is that going to bring
your mother back?

2046
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,320
-Maybe we could start being
father and son again.
-You ain't my father.

2047
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,440
Let me tell you something.

2048
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,320
You look out for yourself.
You look out for your sister.

2049
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,760
You ain't got to worry
about me no more.

2050
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:33,120
But you get that hatred
out your heart, boy,

2051
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:36,400
or you gon' end up
just another nigger,

2052
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,320
like your father.

2053
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,640
It's your ball.

2054
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:56,520
Well, Jake, I think it's time
for all of us to go back home.

2055
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,760
-Okay.
-No. No, Jake.

2056
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:00,680
Turn around.

2057
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:16,520
Let's go.

2058
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:19,400
Let him go. Huh?

2059
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,880
Jesus.

2060
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:26,560
Jesus!

2061
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:47,520
I'm going to read a, uh,
prepared statement from Jesus.

2062
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:50,520
"I'm sorry for not being
with you this morning,

2063
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:53,480
"but under the circumstances my family
and I have chosen to be alone.

2064
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,960
"This past week has been
a very difficult week for me.

2065
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:00,480
"I've done a lot of praying
and have asked for guidance from above.

2066
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,920
"And I do believe that God
has shown me the way.

2067
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,640
"My sister Mary
will be coming with me.

2068
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:11,520
"She will attend seventh grade
at a neighbouring junior high school.

2069
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:16,480
"This September I will
be enrolled at Big State University...

2070
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:19,360
-on a full--"
-on a full athletic scholarship."

2071
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:21,560
-Yes!
-Bullshit!

2072
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:25,400
Later!

2073
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,880
This shit is bogus.
The boy did not go for the bucks.

2074
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:35,480
Hold on.
"This is the right place for me.

2075
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:40,920
"In closing, my family and I send
our prayers out to my father.

2076
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,840
"May God bless him.

2077
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,800
Yours, truly,
Jesus Shuttlesworth."

2078
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:50,120
"Jake Shuttlesworth...

2079
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,200
-"a... convict--
-Convicted.

2080
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:55,640
-convicted mur... der..."
-Murderer.

2081
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:58,400
Give me the paper, man.
You're irking me with that shit.

2082
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:00,840
About to graduate,
you can't even read, dumb ass.

2083
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,000
Can too read. Miss Janus says
I got problems reading out loud.

2084
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,800
-He's just nervous.
-Man, fuck that, Sip. Finish reading.

2085
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,680
Gladly.

2086
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:12,360
"The father of the number-one basketball
prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth...

2087
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:16,040
"was captured last night in the Coney
Island section of Brooklyn, New York...

2088
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,080
-"after a week-long manhunt.
-What?

2089
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:21,440
"He had escaped the maximum security
Attica State Penitentiary...

2090

"seven days before.

2091
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,280
No official word yet
on how he escaped."

2092
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:28,440
How could Uncle Jake have escaped when
they let him walk out the front gate?

2093
02:00:28,521 --> 02:00:31,240
There's got to be some truth
to it if it's in the papers.

2094
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,160
Oh, come on, man!

2095
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:37,760
Yo, Shuttlesworth.

2096
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,800
Warden wants to see you now.

2097
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,200
He say what this is about?

2098
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:52,040
Things didn't work out
exactly as we planned,

2099
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:53,960
but the governor got
what he wanted.

2100
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:57,400
I'm happy for him.
Why do you think my son did it?

2101
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:00,640
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting
your son as yet. I can't speculate.

2102
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:03,240
-Maybe someday you'll get
to ask him that in person.
-Someday.

2103
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:05,160
And when will that be,
Warden?

2104
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:07,560
The governor
has yet to inform me.

2105
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,920
For your information,
technically...

2106
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,440
you did not get your son
to sign the letter of intent.

2107
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:17,320
Hopefully that's not going to
make a difference.

2108
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,280
-We need some time.
-Well, I got that, huh?

2109
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:25,800
Dear Jesus, ever since you was born
I been pushing you,

2110
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:31,840
trying to make you the best ball player
that you could possibly be,

2111
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,560
trying to make you the ball player
that I never was.

2112
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:37,320
I finally came
to the realization...

2113
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:40,680
that I was pushing you
further and further away from me also.

2114
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:46,600
I believe that things
gon' work out for the best for you,

2115
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:48,360
-Jesus was a name.
-for Mary.

2116
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,080
You got the game.

2117
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,120
Sip, sip, sip on this.

2118
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:55,000
Your great-grandfather always used to
tell me that you keep trying on shoes,

2119
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,440
sooner or later you gon'
find a pair that fit you.

2120
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:59,040
The... farmhouse...

2121
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:01,920
Well, I'm here to testify
that I found a pair.

2122
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,160
House. O-U-sss...

2123
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:06,080
They hurt like hell, son.

2124
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:10,720
-I love you.
-"l love you, son."

2125
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:14,360
Your father,
Jake Shuttlesworth.

2126
02:02:57,160 --> 02:03:02,600
Five, four, three, two, one.

2127
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,560
And the crowd goes wild.

2128
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:11,960
Uh-oh. He's heating up.

2129
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:15,240
You can't stop him.
You can only hope to contain him.

2130
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,160
Jake, stop!

2131
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:31,520
Stop right there!

2132
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:35,520
Turn around!
Do it now, or you're a dead man!

2133
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:51,720
Turn around and back up!

2134
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,200
Yeah, that's right,
this cut goes out to all y'all...

2135
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,840
that's been missing us for mad years.

2136
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:48,000
One love, yo. Hey, that's right.
He's got game.

2137
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,720
P.E., 1998.

2138
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:52,760
If man is the father
the son is the center of the earth

2139
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,360
In the middle
of the universe

2140
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:57,120
Then why is this verse
coming six times rehearsed

2141
02:05:57,161 --> 02:05:59,840
Don't freestyle much
but I write them like such

2142
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:02,120
Amongst the themes
controlled by the screens

2143
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:04,680
What does it all mean
All this shit I'm seeing

2144
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:06,960
Human beings
screaming vocal javelins

2145
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:08,800
Sign of a local nigga
unraveling

2146
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,920
-Uh-huh 
-My wandering got my ass wondering

2147
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,280
Where Christ is
in all this crisis

2148
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:16,600
Hating Satan
never knew what nice is

2149
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:19,120
Check the papers
Well, I bet on ices

2150
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,400
More than your eyes can see
and ears can hear

2151
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:23,840
Year by year
all the sense disappears

2152
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:26,040
Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear

2153
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:28,640
-Beware Two-triple 0 is near 
-It might feel good

2154
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,200
It might sound
a little something

2155
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:32,600
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothing

2156
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:35,640
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life

2157
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,280
Behind
the game behind the game

2158
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:41,560
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

2159
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:44,240
It might feel good
It might sound a little something

2160
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:47,520
-But fuck the game
if it ain't saying nothing 
-Damn

2161
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,080
Was it something I said

2162
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,600
Pretend you don't see
so you turn your head

2163
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:53,760
Race scared of his shadow
Does it matter

2164
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,241
The thought of reparation's got him
playing with the population

2165
02:06:57,320 --> 02:06:58,960
Nothing to lose
Everything approved

2166
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,040
People use
Even murders excused

2167
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,200
White men in suits
don't have to jump

2168
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:05,881
Still 1,001 ways
to lose with the shoes

2169
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:08,480
God takes care
of old folks and fools

2170
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,880
While the devil takes care
of making all the rules

2171
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:12,360
Folks don't even
own themselves

2172
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:14,720
Paying mental rent
to corporate presidents

2173
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,440
-My man, my man 
-One out of one million residents

2174
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,240
Be a dissident
who ain't kissing it

2175
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,360
The politics
of chains and whips

2176
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,720
Got the six missing chips
and all the championships

2177
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,040
What's love got to do
with what you got

2178
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:29,520
Don't let a win get to your head
or a loss to your heart

2179
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:31,760
-Word 
-Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear

2180
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,080
Beware
Two-triple 0 is near

2181
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:36,600
It might feel good
It might sound a little something

2182
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:38,400
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothing

2183
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:41,200
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life

2184

Behind
the game behind the game

2185
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:47,720
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

2186
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:50,321
It might feel good
It might sound a little something

2187
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:53,520
But fuck the game
if it ain't saying nothing

2188
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,040
Yeah, that's right.
Everybody got game.

2189
02:07:55,121 --> 02:07:58,840
But we just here to let you all know
that P.E. is in full effect...

2190
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:01,080
from right now
'til the year 2000.

2191
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:02,760
Hey, yo, my man, sing it.

2192
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:04,960
There's something happening here

2193
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,560
-Yeah, yeah.
-What it is

2194
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:09,720
Ain't exactly clear

2195
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:12,600
There's a man

2196
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:15,440
-With a gun over there 
-Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha!

2197
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:20,280
Telling me
I got to beware

2198
02:08:20,361 --> 02:08:23,800
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound

2199
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:27,120
Everybody look
what's going down

2200
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,680
Hey, yo, I don't think
they heard you, Stephen.
Kick it to them again one more time.

2201
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:32,920
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound

2202
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,240
Everybody look
what's going down

2203
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:42,120
Thought of that millennium
just be killing them

2204
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:45,440
And that's scary
Like lies buried in a library

2205
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:46,840
I ain't even got to ask it

2206
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:50,000
And who's underpaid that
got fouled at the basket

2207
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,720
I can't blame the M.V. who be
getting all the Benjies

2208
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,560
And taking them grants
for granted

2209
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:57,520
Last I checked pyramids
wasn't built like projects

2210
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,360
Or on them
government checks, uhh

2211
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,480
Modern-day thugs
ain't got no guts

2212
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,880
Pardon the expression
And the governor nuts

2213
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:06,080
Last time in a church
be the last time in a church

2214
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:09,000
Dead pledge allegiance
to CDs and movies

2215
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,360
Leaving reality
Believe in fantasy

2216
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,760
Bleeding fatalities
Too many formalities

2217
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:15,040
Prayers laced with fear
Beware

2218
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:17,440
Two-triple 0 is here

2219
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:20,120
It might feel good
It might sound a little something

2220
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:22,560
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothing

2221
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:25,880
What is game, who got game
Where is the game in life

2222
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:27,520
Behind
the game behind the game

2223
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:31,680
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game

2224
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:33,720
It might feel good
It might sound a little something

2225
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:37,080
But fuck the game
if it ain't saying nothing

2226
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:41,640
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2227
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:43,360
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2228
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,760
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2229
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:50,480
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2230
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:52,800
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2231
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:55,200
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2232
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:59,960
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2233
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,120
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2234
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,440
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2235
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:09,640
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2236
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,520
-I got game, she got game 
-Everybody knows

2237
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:14,560
-We got game, they got game
he got game 
-What's going down

2238
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:19,240
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound

2239
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:24,000
Everybody knows
what's going down

2240
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:28,720
Ahh, ohh
What's that sound

2241
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:33,360
Everybody knows
what's going down
