1
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:44,957
精神病患者

2
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:31,061
美亚利桑那州  凤凰城

3
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:43,562
12月11日  星期五

4
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:53,563
下午2点43分

5
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,757
你从没好好吃过午饭
You never did eat your lunch, did you?

6
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,628
我该回办公室了
I better get back to the office.

7
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,760
晚了老板会不高兴的
These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.

8
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,269
为什么不给他个电话
Why don't you call your boss and tell him

9
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,670
直接请一下午的假
You're taking the rest of the afternoon off?

10
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,106
反正是礼拜五  天又这么热
Friday anyway, and hot.

11
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,369
下午要是有空  我走着送你去机场吗
What do I do with my free afternoon? Walk you to the airport?

12
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,714
我们可以在这儿多快活一会儿
Well, we could laze around here a while longer.

13
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,416
3点就该退房了
Checking-out time is 3:00 pm.

14
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,857
这种档次的旅店  客人进来没人管
Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in,

15
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,983
可一旦时间到了...
But when your time is up...

16
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,654
萨姆  我讨厌和你在这样的地方偷偷摸摸
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.

17
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,459
听人家说  有些夫妻会故意
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend

18
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,432
找廉价小旅店尝尝鲜
An occasional night in a cheap hotel.

19
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,459
结了婚当然想干嘛就干嘛了
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.

20
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,166
你说话语气  太像结过婚的了
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.

21
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,004
萨姆  这是最后一次
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.

22
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,570
最后一次什么
Yeah? For what?

23
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,873
这一切
For this.

24
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,179
偷偷摸摸  私下幽会
For meeting you in secret so we can be secretive.

25
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:14,948
你来这儿出差  和我午间作乐
You come down here on business trips, and we steal lunch hours.

26
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,320
我甚至希望你没出现过
I wish you wouldn't even come.

27
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,995
好啊  那我们怎么联络感情呢
All right. What do we do instead?

28
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:23,496
写肉麻情书吗
Write each other lurid love letters?

29
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,758
萨姆  我得走了
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

30
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,699
下周我还能来
I can come down next week.

31
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,895
不要
No.

32
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,871
见你一面都不行吗
Not even just to see you?

33
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,872
吃顿正经的午饭怎么样
Have lunch, in public?

34
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,375
可以见面  吃晚饭也成
Oh, we can see each other. We can even have dinner.

35
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,904
但要很体面
But respectably.

36
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,815
在我家   对着我妈妈的照片
In my house, with my mother's picture on the mantel

37
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,286
我姐和我们一起烤3份牛肉
And my sister helping me broil a big steak for three.

38
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,313
那吃完牛肉之后
And after the steak,

39
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,984
让你姐去看电影  把你妈妈的照片扣过去怎么样
Do we send sister to the movies, turn Mama's picture to the wall?

40
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,118
萨姆
Sam!

41
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,662
好吧
All right.

42
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,569
曼璐  无时无刻  我都想见你
Marion, whenever it's possible, I want to see you.

43
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,873
任何情况  大庭广众也行
And under any circumstances, even respectability.

44
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,145
大庭广众听起来像是儿戏
You make respectability sound disrespectful.

45
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,808
不  我说真的
Oh, no, I'm all for it.

46
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:21,446
那就要控制欲火  耐心地等待
It requires patience, temperance, a lot of sweating out.

47
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,786
否则  很难办到
Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.

48
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:30,488
但如果能像现在这样见你爱抚你
But if I can see you and touch you, even as simply as this,

49
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:31,489
我无所谓
I won't mind.

50
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,762
我讨厌为不在的人卖命
I'm tired of sweating for people who aren't there.

51
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,437
我辛辛苦苦为老头子还债
I sweat to pay off my father's debts,

52
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,737
而他却躺在坟墓里
And he's in his grave.

53
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,033
我辛辛苦苦付给前妻生活费
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,

54
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:43,804
她却住在地球另一边的什么鬼地方
And she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.

55
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,978
我也花钱呀
I pay, too.

56
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,044
住旅馆不也得花钱吗
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

57
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,483
过几年  债务还清了
A couple of years my debts will be paid off.

58
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,183
如果我前妻再婚  生活费也不用给了
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.

59
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,021
我连一次婚都没结过
I haven't even been married once yet.

60
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,653
要是真结了婚  你就不这么想了
Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.

61
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,856
萨姆  我们结婚吧
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

62
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:14,264
行啊  想和我混菲尔威尔五金店后仓库吗
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

63
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,474
很搞笑的  跟你讲啊
We'll have lots of laughs. I'll tell you what.

64
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,207
我给前妻寄生活费  你得帮我贴邮票
When I send my ex-wife her alimony, you can lick the stamps.

65
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,112
我会贴邮票的
I'll lick the stamps.

66
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,853
曼璐  你要打消这念头
Marion, you want to cut this off,

67
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,418
还是找个合适的人吧
Go out and find yourself somebody availabIe?

68
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,259
我正在想这事呢
I'm thinking of it.

69
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,904
你怎么会想这事
How could you even think a thing like that?

70
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,005
别误了飞机
Don't miss your plane.

71
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,473
一起走  不行吗
Hey, we can leave together, can't we?

72
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,511
我已经晚了  而你还没穿上鞋呢
I'm late and you have to put your shoes on.

73
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,622
罗沃利老板吃午饭回来了吗
Is Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

74
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,162
他陪哈里斯街投资商吃午饭了
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property.

75
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,066
就是那位石油租赁商  所以还没回来
You know, the oil lease man. That's why he's late.

76
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,167
你头疼?
You got a headache?

77
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:15,701
一会儿就好
It'll pass.

78
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,361
头疼就像决心
Headaches are like resolutions,

79
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,405
忘了它就没事了
You forget them as soon as they stop hurting.

80
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,667
你有阿司匹林吗
Have you got some Aspirin?

81
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,368
我有一种药  但不是阿司匹林
I've got something, not Aspirin.

82
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,339
结婚那天我妈的医生给的
My mother's doctor gave them to me the day of my wedding.

83
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,178
泰迪发现我吃止疼片很生气
Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranqullizers.

84
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,181
有电话吗
Any calls?

85
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,554
泰迪打给我  我妈打来看泰迪是否打给我
Teddy called me. My mother called to see if Teddy called.

86
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,455
你姐打电话说要去图森买东西
Oh, your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying

87
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,719
还说她整个周末不回家了
And she'll be gone the whole weekend and...

88
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,859
真他妈的热
It's as hot as fresh milk.

89
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,368
小姐们  快让老板给你们装冷气机
Hey, you girls ought to get your boss to air condition you up.

90
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,839
他今天发财了
He can afford it today.

91
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:55,702
曼璐
Marion,

92
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,503
-拿文件给卡西迪先生看看  -好的
- Will you get the copies of that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?  - Yes, sir.

93
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:02,046
明天是我心肝宝贝的大日子
Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.

94
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,514
不是你  是我家闺女
Oh, not you. My daughter.

95
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,617
我的宝贝
A baby.

96
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,944
明天她要甜甜蜜蜜地
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self

97
00:08:10,944 --> 00:08:13,389
嫁给别人当老婆啦
Up there and gets married away from me.

98
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,520
给你看她的照片
I want you to take a look at my baby.

99
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,334
18岁啦
Eighteen years old

100
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,569
从小到大她从没不开心过
And she never had an unhappy day in any one of those years.

101
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,638
别扯了  汤姆  我办公室可凉快了
Come on, Tom. My office is air conditioned.

102
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,543
知道我怎么哄她开心的吗
Do you know what I do about unhappiness?

103
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,970
我把不开心都买去了
I buy it off.

104
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,440
你...你不开心吗
Are...are you unhappy?

105
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,814
偶尔吧
Not inordinately.

106
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,057
我送这套房子给闺女当嫁妆
I'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present.

107
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,558
4万块现金
$40,000 cash.

108
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,529
有钱能使鬼推磨
Now that's not buying happiness.

109
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,630
花这点儿钱只图大家乐呵
That's just buying off unhappiness.

110
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,232
一般我是带多少花多少
I never carry more than I can afford to lose.

111
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,132
数数
Count them!

112
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,235
我的天啊
I declare!

113
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,974
这就是我的花钱之道
I don't. That's how I get to keep it.

114
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,876
汤姆  直接付这么多现金不合程序
Tom, a cash transaction of this size is most irregular.

115
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:17,481
那又怎样  买卖就是你情我愿
So what? It's my private money. Now it's yours.

116
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,819
为何不先安放好这笔钱
Suppose we put it in the safe,

117
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,419
周一早上如果你感觉好点...
And then Monday morning when you're feeling good...

118
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,691
说到感觉好点
Oh, speaking of feeling good,

119
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,893
你念叨的桌子里的那瓶酒呢
Where's that bottle you said was in your desk?

120
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:36,272
我偶尔才大嘴巴的
You know, sometimes I can keep my mouth shut.

121
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,111
罗沃利  我他妈太馋那瓶酒了
Lowery, I am dying of thirst aroonie.

122
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,347
这钱可不能放在办公室里
I don't even want it in the office over the weekend.

123
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,653
周末前赶紧存到银行保险柜里
Put it in the safe deposit box in the bank,

124
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,819
周一再让他确认一下
And we'll get him to give us a check on Monday instead.

125
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:55,987
好的
Yes.

126
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,588
乔治・罗沃利私人办公室

127
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,263
他一直调戏你呢
He was flirting with you.

128
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,169
他一定注意到我的结婚戒指了
I guess he must've noticed my wedding ring.

129
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,084
进来
Come in.

130
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,553
老板  给您文件  可以的话
The copies Mr. Lowery, if you don't mind,

131
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,252
我想去完银行直接回家
I'd like to go right on home after the bank.

132
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,591
-我头有点晕...  -直接回家吧  宝贝儿
- I have a slight... - You go right on home.

133
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,824
你老板和我正要出去呢
Because me and your boss are going out

134
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,423
接着喝酒去  对吧
And get ourselves a little drinking done. Right?

135
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,298
当然  不舒服吗
Of course. Do you feel ill?

136
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,631
头有点儿疼
Just a headache.

137
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,073
你该去拉斯维加斯度个周末
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,

138
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,074
那儿可是世界的乐园
The playground of the world.

139
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,407
我在家休养两天就好了  谢谢
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed. Thank you.

140
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,776
不吃点儿药吗  对付头疼可管用了
Aren't you going to take the pills? They'll knock that headache out.

141
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,252
药片换不来开心
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.

142
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,338
去银行存完钱后
I guess I'll go put this money in the bank

143
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:00,288
我要回家睡上一觉
And then go home and sleep it off.

144
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,614
曼璐  怎么回事  你来这儿干什么
Marion, what in the world, what are you doing up here?

145
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,552
当然啦  见到你我好开心  一直都是啊
Of course I'm glad to see you, I always am,

146
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,418
曼璐  这是什么
What is it, Marion?

147
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,214
先停下
Hold it there.

148
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,924
您很赶时间啊
In quite a hurry.

149
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,163
对  我本想打个盹儿的
Yes. I didn't intend to sleep so long.

150
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,170
昨晚太困了  差点没撞车
I almost had an accident last night from sleepiness,

151
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,365
于是就在这儿停会儿
So I decided to pull over.

152
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,169
您在这儿过了一整晚吗
You slept here all night?

153
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,634
对  我说了  实在是太困了
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes open.

154
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,413
附近有好多汽车旅馆  您可以...
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should've...

155
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,212
我是说  那儿更安全
I mean, just to be safe.

156
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,612
我没打算睡一整晚的  只想停一小会儿
I didn't intend to sleep all night. I just pulled over.

157
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:23,153
我违法了吗
Have I broken any laws?

158
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,782
没有  女士
No, Ma.am.

159
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,348
那我可以走了吗
Then I'm free to go?

160
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,557
您遇到什么麻烦了吗
Is anything wrong?

161
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,396
当然没有  我像是遇到麻烦的人吗
Of course not. Am I acting as if there's something wrong?

162
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,458
说实话  很像
Frankly, yes.

163
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,163
拜托   我得走了
Please, I'd like to go.

164
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,533
真的没有吗
Well, is there?

165
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,869
您什么意思
Is there what?

166
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,377
跟您说过了  我没遇到什么麻烦
I've told you there's nothing wrong,

167
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,381
就是很着急  而您正在耽误我的时间
Except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time.

168
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,513
再等等  先别启动
Now, just a moment. Turn your motor off, please.

169
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,146
可以看下您的驾照吗
May I see your license?

170
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:00,950
为什么
Why?

171
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,119
请出示
Please.

172
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,646
请您稍等片刻
Be with you in a second!

173
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,615
-我没心情找麻烦  -什么
- I'm in no mood for trouble. - What?

174
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,537
俗话说的好
There's an old saying. ..

175
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,658
第一位顾客总是最麻烦
The first customer of the day is always the most trouble...

176
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,353
我说了  不想找麻烦
But like I say, I'm in no mood for it,

177
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,626
我直接实在点儿  包您满意
So I'm gonna treat you so fair and square that you won.

178
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,726
我有理由...
I have one human reason...

179
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,992
可以用我的车换吗
Can I trade my car in and take another?

180
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,330
秃子头上长虱子  明摆着  可以
Do anything you have a mind to being a woman, you will.

181
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:31,231
那辆是您的吗
That yours?

182
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,602
对  车本身没有任何毛病
Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.

183
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,164
-我只是...  -有点儿看腻了
- I just... - Sick of the sight of it.

184
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,368
那您随便看看
Why don't you have a look around here

185
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,876
挑辆中意的
And see if there's something that strikes your eyes.

186
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,936
然后我让机械师给您做个一站式维护
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic give yours the once-over.

187
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,004
-想喝点儿咖啡吗  我正打算...  -不  谢谢
- You want some coffee? I was just about... - No, thank you.

188
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,448
我很急  只想换辆车
I'm in a hurry and I just wanna make a change.

189
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,985
一般来讲  买完二手车
One thing people never ought to be

190
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,044
急着走的肯定有问题
When they're buying used cars and that's in a hurry.

191
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,668
不过我说了  天气好不吵架
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.

192
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,684
我先把您的车开到车库里
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

193
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,472
我为你推荐这款
That's the one I'd have picked for you myseIf.

194
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,710
-多少钱  -先试试吧
- How much? - Go ahead.

195
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,979
上街跑两圈
Spin it around the block.

196
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,280
看起来不错
It looks fine.

197
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,322
我的车外加多少钱卖
How much would it be with my car?

198
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,485
您不想试试车  考虑一两天吗
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?

199
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,529
您真是很急呀  有人追您吗
You are in a hurry, aren't you? Somebody chasing you?

200
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,530
当然没有  说个价吧
Of course not. Please.

201
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:37,369
遇到顾客这么为难售车员真是头一次呀
Well, it's the first time the customer ever high pressured the salesman.

202
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,567
大概算一下
I figure roughly

203
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,303
算上原先的的车您给700块吧
Your car plus $700.

204
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,711
700块
$700

205
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,180
您还是会花点时间讲价的  对吧
You always got time to argue money, huh?

206
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,515
行
All right.

207
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,017
我希望您证明下那车的确是您的
I take it you can prove that car is yours.

208
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,061
我是说联邦驾照  车辆所有权证明
I mean, out-of-state license and all. You got your pink slip...

209
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,929
-我确定手续齐备  -有卫生间吗
- I believe I have the necessary papers. - Is there a ladies room?

210
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,660
在楼里面
In the building.

211
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,346
那边
Over there.

212
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,829
我希望您先试一下车
I think you better take it for a trial spin.

213
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,501
我不想败坏加州查理(二手车商)的名声
I don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.

214
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,668
我看没必要吧
I'd really rather not.

215
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,569
我们就不能马上交易然后...
Can't we just settle this and...

216
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,206
女士  跟您说实话
I might as well be perfectly honest with you, Ma.am.

217
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,579
不是我不相信您  不过...
It's not that I don't trust you, but...

218
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,015
不过什么
But what?

219
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,915
因为赶时间  看好了就付钱
Is there anything so terribly wrong

220
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,955
有什么严重问题吗
About making a decision and wanting to hurry?

221
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,884
您认为那车是我偷的吗
Do you think I've stolen my car?

222
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,220
不是那意思  女士
No, Ma.am.

223
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,524
好吧  我们进去谈
All right, let's go inside.

224
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,306
放里面就行了
Just put it in here, please.

225
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,679
谢谢
Thank you.

226
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,814
加州查理: 见鬼了  警官
California Charlie's voice, heck, officer,

227
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,153
第一次遇到这样的顾客
That was the first time I ever saw the customer

228
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,421
这么为难售车员的
High pressure the salesman,

229
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,395
警察: 有人追她吗
Officer,' Somebody chasing her?

230
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,490
查理  让我看下她的文件
I better have a look at those papers, Charlie,

231
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,262
加州查理: 您看她有问题吗
Callfornia Charlie,' She look like a wrong one to you?

232
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,030
警察: 有点儿可疑
Officer,' Acted like one,

233
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,433
加州查理: 最可笑的是
Callfornia Charlie,' The only funny thing,

234
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,633
她还付给我700块现金呢
She paid me $700 in cash

235
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,481
卡洛琳: 是的  罗沃利老板
Caroline,' Yes, Mr. Lowery,

236
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,020
罗沃利: 卡洛琳  曼璐还没来吗
Lowery,' Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

237
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,193
卡洛琳: 还没有  老板
Caroline,' No, Mr. Lowery,

238
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:19,580
不过周一早上她总会晚到一会儿
But then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings,

239
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,025
罗沃利: 她来了马上给我打电话
Lowery,' buzz me the minute she comes in,

240
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,531
给她姐打电话  家里电话没人接
And call her sister, no one's answering at the house,

241
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,999
卡洛琳: 罗沃利老板  她姐姐单位我打过了
Caroline,' I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works,

242
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,093
就是那家音乐大师音像店
The Music Makers Music Store, you know,

243
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,832
和我们一样  她也不知道曼璐在哪儿
And she doesn't know where Marion is any more than we do,

244
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,100
罗沃利: 你最好去她家看看
Lowery,' you better run out to the house,

245
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,699
她可能在家  但没法接电话
She may be, well, unable to answer the phone,

246
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:41,440
卡洛琳: 她姐姐也正打算回家呢  和我们一样着急
Caroline,' her sister's going to do that, she's as worried as we are,

247
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,108
罗沃利: 我真是搞不明白
Lowery,' no, I haven't the faintest idea,

248
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:50,087
我最后看见你妹妹  是上周五办公室里
As I said, I last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday,

249
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,667
她说不舒服想早点下班
She said she didn't feel well and wanted to leave early,

250
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,717
我允许了
And I said she could,

251
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,785
那是最后一面  等等
That was the last I saw, oh, wait a minute,

252
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,695
我过一会儿又见到她了  开着车...
I did see her some time later, driving,,,

253
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:04,127
你最好赶紧来我办公室一趟
I think you'd better come over here to my office, quick,

254
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,861
卡洛琳  请卡西迪先生过来
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me,

255
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,133
罗沃利: 卡西迪  跟你说过  那么多现金不安全
After all, Cassidy, I toId you, all that cash!

256
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,841
我没有什么责任
I'm not taking the responsiblity,

257
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,473
卡西迪: 去他娘的
Cassidy,' Oh, for heaven's sake,

258
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,519
她给你当了10年差  你那么信任她
A girl works for you for 10 years, you trust her,

259
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:22,781
罗沃利: 好了  你最好来一趟
All right, yes, you better come over,

260
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:28,017
卡西迪: 我可不想4万块就这么打水漂了
Cassidy,' Well, I ain't about to kiss off $40,000!

261
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:30,108
我得把钱找回来  一个子儿都不能少
I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,

262
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:32,121
钱要是没了有她好看  臭娘们儿
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!

263
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,597
我要抓住她  不管你怎么想
I'll track her, never you doubt it,

264
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,099
罗沃利: 且慢  卡西迪
Lowery,' hold on, Cassidy,

265
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:40,662
我还是不能相信  其中定有蹊跷  我不能...
I still can't belleve. It must be some kind of a mystery, I can't...

266
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,037
卡西迪: 你不是去银行查过了吗
You checked with the bank, no?

267
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:43,938
他们不是从没见过她吗
They never laid eyes on her, no?

268
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,202
你到底信她什么  老天爷呀
You still trusting? Hot creepers!

269
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:49,003
我大大咧咧掏钱的时候她就坐在那儿
She sat there while I dumped it out!

270
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,651
眼皮都没抬几下  暗自盘算着
Hardly even looked at it, planning,

271
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:52,752
甚至还和我眉来眼去
And even flirting with me!

272
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:58,896
贝茨汽车旅馆  仍有空房

273
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,730
抱歉  雨太大我没听到您叫门
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you in all this rain.

274
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,596
请进来吧
Go ahead in, please.

275
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,131
风尘仆仆啊
Dirty night.

276
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,732
有空房吗
You have a vacancy?

277
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,745
总共12间  间间都空着呢
Oh, we have 12 vacancies. Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.

278
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,741
高速...转道了
They... They moved away the highway.

279
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,409
我还以为已经下高速了呢
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.

280
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,681
早料到了
I knew you must have.

281
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:47,317
谁没事愿在这儿停车呢
Nobody ever stops here anymore unless they've done that.

282
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:51,652
不过我们没感觉有什么损失
But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.

283
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,928
照常点灯  照常营业
We just keep on lighting the lights and following the formallties.

284
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:58,938
玛丽・萨米尔
Marie Samuels

285
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,931
您的家庭地址  填下镇名就行了
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.

286
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,646
洛杉矶
Los Angeles.

287
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,555
1号房  需要什么服务随叫随到
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want anything.

288
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:19,818
就在服务台旁边
Right next to the office.

289
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,918
我就想好好睡一觉  再吃点儿东西
I want sleep more than anything else, except maybe food.

290
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,610
沿路朝前10里左右有家大馆子
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles up the road,

291
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,692
就在菲尔威尔城外
Just outside of Fairvale.

292
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,232
这儿离菲尔威尔那么近啊
Am I that close to Fairvale?

293
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,825
15里  我去拿您的行李
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

294
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,148
天啊  里面真闷
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

295
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,356
垫子很软
Well, the mattress is soft

296
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,648
衣服可以挂在衣柜里
And there's hangers in the closet and

297
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:05,136
还有印有贝茨汽车旅馆的文具
Stationery with bates motel printed on it

298
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:08,571
可以带回家给您的朋友炫耀一下
In case you wanna make your friends back home feel envious.

299
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,130
还有那什么...
And the...

300
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:13,806
在那儿
Over there.

301
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,107
盥洗室
The bathroom.

302
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:21,647
如果您有需要  就敲一下墙
Well, if you want anything, just tap on the wall.

303
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,018
-我就在服务台  -谢谢您  贝茨先生
- I'll be in the office. - Thank you, Mr. Bates.

304
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,681
诺曼・贝茨
Norman Bates.

305
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,558
您不会是打算开车去吃晚饭吧
You're not really gonna go out again and drive up to the diner, are you?

306
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,928
是啊
No.

307
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,934
那您愿意帮我个忙吗  和我吃个晚饭怎么样
Well, then would you do me a favor? Would you have dinner with me?

308
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,492
我就一个人
I was just about to myseIf.

309
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,902
没什么特别的  只有三明治和牛奶
You know, nothing special, just sandwiches and milk.

310
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:44,636
如果你能来  我会非常高兴的
But I'd like it very much if you'd come up to the house.

311
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:49,541
我餐桌并不豪华  但厨房却很温馨
I don't set a fancy table, but the kitchen's awful homey.

312
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,045
-我很乐意  -好的
- I'd like to. - All right.

313
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,813
你自己收拾一下  脱掉湿靴子
You get yourself settled and take off your wet shoes,

314
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,650
我准备好了就叫你
And I'll be back as soon as it's ready.

315
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:57,916
好的
Okay.

316
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,320
我会...打伞来接你
With my... with my trusty umbrella.

317
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,035
不行  我告诉你  不行
No! I tell you no!

318
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,443
我不能让你带陌生年轻女孩来吃饭
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper!

319
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,847
烛光晚餐  这种低俗色情的方式
By candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap, erotic fashion

320
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,283
来自于年轻人低俗色情的心理
Of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

321
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,945
母亲  别这样
Mother, please.

322
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,247
然后呢  晚餐后呢  音乐?  情话?
And then what, after supper? Music? Whispers?

323
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,623
母亲  她只是个陌生人  饿着肚子  外面又在下雨
Mother, she's just a stranger. She's hungry and it's raining out.

324
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,685
母亲  她只是个陌生人...
...mother, she's just a stranger...

325
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:48,096
男人不该随便和不认识的女子来往...
As if men don't desire strangers. As if...

326
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:52,365
我不想再说这些令人反胃的事了  我觉得恶心
I refuse to speak of disgusting things, because they disgust me!

327
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,733
你明白了吗  孩子  去吧
You understand, boy? Go on.

328
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,999
告诉她  我做的饭和我儿子
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite

329
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,476
都不会让她喜欢的
With my food or my son!

330
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:03,905
你没胆量的话  要我亲自去说吗
Or do I have to tell her 'cause you don't have the guts?

331
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,212
怎么样  孩子  你有没有胆量  孩子
Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?

332
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,014
闭嘴  闭嘴
Shut up! Shut up!

333
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,328
我给你添麻烦了
I've caused you some trouble.

334
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,624
不
No.

335
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:56,160
母亲...我母亲
Mother... my mother...

336
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,665
怎么说呢
What is the phrase?

337
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,869
她今天心情不太好
She isn't quite herself today.

338
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:06,633
你不必麻烦了  我真的不饿
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.

339
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,004
我很抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,643
我希望能替她道歉
I wish you could apologize for other people.

341
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,017
不要紧
Don't worry about it.

342
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,651
不过既然你准备好了晚餐  我们一起吃吧
But as long as you've fixed a supper, we may as well eat it.

343
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:36,732
服务台那里会比较暖和
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.

344
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,886
雨停了
Well, it stopped raining.

345
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,449
服务台不太方便
Eating in an office is just too officious.

346
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,286
后面有个小房间
I have the parlor back here.

347
00:34:58,363 --> 00:34:59,489
好的
All right.

348
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,071
请坐
Sit down.

349
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,775
谢谢
Thank you.

350
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,749
你真好
You're very kind.

351
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,114
都是你的  我不饿  你吃吧
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

352
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,893
你...你吃东西的样子像只鸟
You... you eat like a bird.

353
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,528
你很了解它们
And you'd know, of course.

354
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,796
不  也不是
No, not really.

355
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,275
总之  我听说  跟鸟的吃相一样
Anyway, I hear the expression ..eats like a bird..

356
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:49,440
是不对...不对的
Is really a false... falsity.

357
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,216
因为鸟的食量很大
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.

358
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,421
我对鸟的习性不是很了解
But I don't really know anything about birds.

359
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,288
我喜欢收集东西
My hobby is stuffing things.

360
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,191
比如标本
You know, taxidermy.

361
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:07,260
我想我比较喜欢鸟
And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds

362
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:10,494
因为我讨厌看到野兽做成的标本
Because I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed.

363
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,560
像狐狸和人猿什么的
You know, foxes and chimps.

364
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,573
有些人甚至拿狗和猫做标本  我可做不到
Some people even stuff dogs and cats, but, oh, I can't do that.

365
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,609
我想只有鸟类标本比较好看  因为...
I think only birds look well stuffed because...

366
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,136
因为它们会和你培养出情感
Well, because they're kind of passive to begin with.

367
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:26,579
很奇怪的爱好  很稀奇
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

368
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,308
也很不寻常
Uncommon, too.

369
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,048
我想也是
Oh, I imagine so.

370
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,147
这并不如你想像的花钱  很便宜的
And it's not as expensive as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

371
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,751
只要有针线  苏打粉
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

372
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,592
只要花钱买些化学品就可以了
The chemicals are the only thing that cost anything.

373
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,723
人应该有爱好的
A man should have a hobby.

374
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:46,336
这...这不只是爱好
Well, it's... It's more than a hobby.

375
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,737
爱好是用来消磨时间  而不是充实自己的
A hobby's supposed to pass the time, not fill it.

376
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,478
你感到空虚吗
Is your time so empty?

377
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,638
不
No.

378
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,646
我经营这家旅馆
Well, I run the office

379
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,152
打扫房间
And tend the cabins and grounds

380
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,950
帮我母亲做些
And do little errands for my mother.

381
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:08,322
她认为我可以做的事
The ones she allows I might be capable of doing.

382
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,021
你和朋友们出去吗
Do you go out with friends?

383
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,900
一个男孩最好的朋友就是他母亲
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

384
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:23,140
你一生中还从未有过空虚的时候吧
You've never had an empty moment in your entire life, have you?

385
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,974
一个人的时候会有
Only my share.

386
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,535
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

387
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,283
我不是要刺探你
I didn't mean to pry.

388
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,376
我在找一处没人去的地方
I'm looking for a private island.

389
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,521
你在逃避什么事情吗
What are you running away from?

390
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,086
为什么这么问
Why do you ask that?

391
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,658
人们总是在逃避事情
People never run away from anything.

392
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,998
雨下的时间不长  你知道我怎么想的吗
The rain didn't last long, did it? You know what I think?

393
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,832
我在想
I think that

394
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,536
我们都掉在自己的陷阱中
We're all in our private traps,

395
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,581
被它紧紧困住  没人爬得出来
Clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out.

396
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,182
我们想抓住什么东西
We scratch and claw,

397
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,788
但抓到的只是空气  只是陷阱
But only at the air, only at each other.

398
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,221
结果  没有一点进展
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.

399
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:23,629
有时候我们根本没掉入那些陷阱
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.

400
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:29,065
我掉进去了  我不在乎了
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.

401
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,836
你应该在乎  应该在乎的
Oh, but you should. You should mind it.

402
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,276
我在乎  但我想说不在乎
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

403
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:41,285
如果有人像你母亲对你那样
You know, if anyone ever talked to me the way I heard,

404
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,114
同我说话的话...
The way she spoke to you...

405
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,891
有时候当她那样对我说话时
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,

406
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:53,931
我真想上楼去咒骂她  永远离开她
I feel I'd like to go up there and curse her and leave her forever.

407
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,464
至少不会顺从她
Or at least defy her.

408
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,869
但我知道我不能这样
But I know I can't.

409
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,008
她病了
She's ill.

410
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,308
听她说话的声音很健康
She sounded strong.

411
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,142
不  她病了
No, I mean ill.

412
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:17,115
自从我父亲死后她扶养我到现在
She had to raise me all by herself, after my father died.

413
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,783
当时我才5岁  对她的打击很大
I was only five and it must've been quite a strain for her.

414
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,293
她不必出去工作
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or anything like that.

415
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,488
他给她留下了一点儿钱
He left her a little money.

416
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:29,866
几年前母亲遇到了一个男人
Anyway, a few years ago, mother met this man.

417
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:33,700
他说服她盖了这栋旅馆
And he talked her into building this motel.

418
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,138
他可以说服她干任何事
He could have talked her into anything.

419
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,473
当他也死后  对她的打击更大
And when he died, too, it was just too great a shock for her.

420
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,813
他死的样子...
And the way he died...

421
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,517
你吃饭时不应该说这些的
I guess it's nothing to talk about while you're eating.

422
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:54,992
总之  那对她是一大重创  她什么都没了
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her. She had nothing left.

423
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,162
至少还有你啊
Except you.

424
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,624
儿子是替代不了爱人的
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.

425
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,467
你为什么不离开呢
Why don't you go away?

426
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:09,302
像你一样  去一个没人的地方吗
To a private island, like you?

427
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,345
不  不是像我
No, not like me.

428
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:19,475
我不能那样  谁来照顾她呢
I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?

429
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,111
她会很寂寞的
She'd be alone up there.

430
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,922
壁炉的火会灭的
Her fire would go out.

431
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,182
这里会寒冷得像座坟墓
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.

432
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,525
如果你爱某人
If you love someone,

433
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,828
即使你恨他  你也不会这样做
You don't do that to them, even if you hate them.

434
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,395
你知道吗  我不恨她
You understand, I don't hate her.

435
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,297
我只是恨她变成这个样子
I hate what she's become.

436
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,106
我恨她的病态
I hate the illness.

437
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,241
如果你把她安置在某处...
Wouldn't it be better if you put her

438
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,542
是不是比较好
Someplace...

439
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,915
你是说那个地方?  疯人院?
You mean an institution? A madhouse?

440
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,554
人们说的某处就是疯人院  不是吗
People always call a madhouse someplace, don't they?

441
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,691
把她安置在某处
Put her in someplace.

442
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,262
抱歉  我不是说不照顾她
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.

443
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,607
你对照顾知道多少
What do you know about caring?

444
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,839
你到那种地方去看过吗
Have you ever seen the inside of one of those places?

445
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,142
他们又哭又笑
The laughing and the tears

446
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,713
用阴冷的双眼观察你
And the cruel eyes studying you.

447
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,480
我的母亲去那种地方?
My mother there?

448
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,554
但她不会伤害别人
But she's harmless.

449
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,424
她不会伤害别人  就像那些标本鸟一样
She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds.

450
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:40,929
对不起
I am sorry.

451
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:45,702
我只是觉得...她好像在伤害你
I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.

452
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:48,896
我没有恶意
I meant well.

453
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,668
人们总说没有恶意
People always mean well.

454
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,874
他们言辞温和  动作优雅
They cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads

455
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,573
建议正确  好像很优美一样
And suggest, oh, so very delicately.

456
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,616
当然  我自己也对自己建议过
Of course, I've suggested it myself.

457
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,727
但我讨厌这种想法
But I hate to even think about it.

458
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:12,986
她需要我
She needs me.

459
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,397
她并不是...
It's not as if she were

460
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:22,235
疯子或者精神错乱的人
A maniac, a raving thing.

461
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:27,677
只是有时候会神智不清
She just goes a little mad sometimes.

462
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,183
我们有时候也会神智不清
We all go a little mad sometimes.

463
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,320
你没有过吗
Haven't you?

464
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:40,516
有过
Yes.

465
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,526
但一次就够了
Sometimes just one time can be enough.

466
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,662
谢谢你
Thank you.

467
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,827
谢谢你  诺曼
Thank you, Norman.

468
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,130
诺曼
Norman.

469
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:57,272
你是不是要回房去了
Oh, you're not going back to your room already?

470
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,243
我很累
I'm very tired.

471
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,178
明天还要开车  回凤凰城
And I have a long drive tomorrow, all the way back to Phoenix.

472
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:04,810
是吗
Really?

473
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,685
我在那里闯了点祸
I stepped into a private trap back there

474
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:13,118
我要回去处理一下
And I'd like to go back and try to pull myself out of it

475
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,450
乘还来得及
Before it's too late for me, too.

476
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:19,326
你真的不想再多待一会儿吗
Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay just a little while longer?

477
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,297
只是聊聊天
Just for talk?

478
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,597
我很想  但是...
Oh, I'd like to, but...

479
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:24,965
好吧
All right.

480
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,755
那明天早晨再见
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

481
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,665
我会给你带点儿早点  好吗
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

482
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,968
什么时候走
What time?

483
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,406
很早  黎明吧
Very early. Dawn.

484
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,577
好  怎么称呼...
All right, miss...

485
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:34,771
克兰
Crane.

486
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:35,938
克兰  没错
Crane. That's it.

487
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,481
晚安
Good night.

488
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:46,357
不
No!

489
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,025
不
No!

490
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:55,290
母亲  天哪  母亲
Mother! Oh, god, mother!

491
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,224
血  血
Blood! Blood!

492
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:26,956
我试过很多牌子
I've tried many brands.

493
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:31,618
到目前为止  我用过的似乎都没什么效果
So far, of those I've used, I haven't had much luck with any of them.

494
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,061
看看这个牌子怎么说
Let's see what they say about this one.

495
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,429
它说的那些成分
They tell you what its ingredients are

496
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,527
保证可以驱除所有蚊虫
And how it's guaranteed to exterminate every insect in the world,

497
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,665
但它没说是不是有痛苦
But they do not tell you whether or not it's painless.

498
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,471
我想  昆虫和人一样  希望没有痛苦地死去
And I say, insect or man, death should always be painless.

499
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,542
我想这个牌子的品质
I suppose, this one seems to claim more and better

500
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:53,447
应该比其他的好
Qualities than lots of the others.

501
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,488
萨姆?
Sam?

502
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:08,488
萨姆  有位女士找你
Sam! Lady wants to see you.

503
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:15,760
小姐  什么事
Yes, miss?

504
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,329
我是曼璐的姐姐
I'm Marion's sister.

505
01:01:17,808 --> 01:01:18,968
是莱拉呀
Oh, sure. Lila.

506
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,304
曼璐在这里吗
Is Marion here?

507
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,445
当然不在
Well, of course not.

508
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,242
有什么事吗
Something wrong?

509
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,315
她星期五离开家
She left home on Friday.

510
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:34,050
我和孩子在图森度周末  那时我就没见到她
I was in Tucson over the weekend and I haven't heard from her since.

511
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,024
甚至没接到她的电话
Not even a phone call.

512
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,882
如果你们两个要在一起  我不会管
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care,

513
01:01:38,882 --> 01:01:39,720
这不关我的事
It's none of my business,

514
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,889
我要和曼璐谈  我要曼璐告诉我
But I want to talk to Marion and I want her to tell me

515
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,592
这不关我的事  然后我就走...
It's none of my business and then I'll go...

516
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,932
鲍伯  出去吃午餐吧
Bob, run out and get yourself some lunch, will you?

517
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:48,972
没关系  萨姆  我带了
That's okay, Sam. I brought it with me.

518
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,973
那就出去吃吧
Run out and eat it.

519
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,681
我们两个怎么会在一起
Now, what thing could we be in together?

520
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,050
对不起  我失态了
Sorry about the tears.

521
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:04,516
曼璐出事了吗  怎么回事
Well, is Marion in trouble? What is it?

522
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:07,652
我们一起来谈谈曼璐  好不好
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?

523
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:13,319
你是谁  朋友
Who are you, friend?

524
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,558
我叫阿伯盖斯特  朋友
My name is Arbogast, friend.

525
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:17,759
私家侦探
I'm a private investigator.

526
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:20,130
她在哪里  克兰小姐
Where is she, Miss Crane?

527
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,693
我不认识你
I don't know you.

528
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:24,780
我知道你不认识我  因为如果你认识
Why, I know you don't, because if you did,

529
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,075
我就无法跟踪你了
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

530
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:28,373
你为什么要插手这事
What's your interest in this?

531
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,403
4万块钱
Well, $40,000.

532
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,117
-4万块钱?  -对
- $40,000? - That's right.

533
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,255
你们最好告诉我发生了什么事  快点说
Well, one of you'd better tell me what's going on, and tell me fast.

534
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:42,349
我实在无法忍受...
I can take just so much of this...

535
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,552
别激动  朋友
Now, take it easy, friend.

536
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:48,189
别激动  只是你的女朋友偷了4万块钱
Take it easy. It's just that your girlfriend stole $40,000.

537
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,665
你在说什么  到底怎么回事
What are you talking about? What is this?

538
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:54,898
她星期五本来该去银行存钱  但她没有
She was supposed to bank it on Friday for her boss and she didn't.

539
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,830
之后没有人再看到她
And no one has seen her since.

540
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,602
有人看到过她
Someone has seen her.

541
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:01,735
有人知道她有4万块钱
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.

542
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:04,576
萨姆  他们不想控告  只希望把钱要回来
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back.

543
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:05,774
萨姆  假如她在这里...
Sam, if she's here...

544
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,646
她不在  她不在这里
She isn't. She isn't.

545
01:03:07,718 --> 01:03:09,413
克兰小姐  可以问你个问题吗
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

546
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:12,250
你只是来这里而没有其他想法吗
Did you come up here on just a hunch and nothing more?

547
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,552
我根本没想到其他事  只是希望
Not even a hunch. Just hope.

548
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,185
等我们查证后  我就能相信你了
Well, with a little checking I could get to believe you.

549
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:21,063
我不在乎你是否相信我
I don't care if you believe me or not.

550
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,498
我只想在曼璐越陷越深之前找到她
All I want to do is see Marion before she gets in this too deeply.

551
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:26,160
你有没有去凤凰城的医院找
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?

552
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,026
她可能出了车祸  或被抢劫
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

553
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:30,005
不  有人看到她驾车离开市区
No, she was seen leaving town in her own car,

554
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:32,337
补充一下  是她老板看到的
By her employer, I might add.

555
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:35,040
我不敢相信  你呢
I can't believe it. Can you?

556
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,280
对于名声不好的人
Well, you know, we're always quickest to doubt people

557
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:41,874
我们都持怀疑态度
Who have a reputation for being honest.

558
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:44,250
我想她在这里  克兰小姐
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

559
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,482
她的这位男友...
Where there's a boyfriend...

560
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:48,788
可能并没有在幕后操纵
Well, she's not back there with the nuts and bolts,

561
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:51,589
但她一定在这里  在市区的某个地方
But she's here, in this town somewhere.

562
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:54,520
我会找到她  我会见到你的
I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.

563
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:33,668
-晚上好  -晚上好
- Evening. - Evening.

564
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:35,500
我刚才差一点儿在那里转弯
I almost drove right past.

565
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:38,632
我忘了把灯箱打开  我们有空房
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

566
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,700
总共12间  间间都空着呢  吃糖
Twelve, in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. Candy?

567
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:43,336
不  谢谢
No, thanks.

568
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:46,507
这两天我已经看了很多旅馆  眼都花了
Last two days, I've been to so many motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

569
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:49,035
这里是第一个
But, you know, this is the first place that

570
01:04:49,035 --> 01:04:50,110
远离尘世的地方
Looks like it's hiding from the world.

571
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:53,054
说实话  我不是忘了把灯箱打开
Well, I'll tell you the truth. I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.

572
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:56,388
只是想让人以为这里很少人来
Just doesn't seem like any use anymore, you know.

573
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,295
那里本来是主干道
See, that used to be the main highway right there.

574
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,591
进来登记吧
Well, wanna come in and register?

575
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:03,155
不  不  你坐下  我不想麻烦你
No, no, sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

576
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,757
只是想问你几个问题
I just wanna ask a few questions.

577
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:06,427
不  不麻烦  今天是换洗日
No, that's no trouble. Today's linen day.

578
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,371
我每周都把床铺清洗一下
I always change the beds here once a week

579
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,097
不管有没有人住
Whether they've been used or not.

580
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:11,640
你讨厌潮湿  对吧  那...
Hate the smell of dampness, don't you? It's such a...

581
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:14,438
我不知道  发臭了  进来吧
I don't know, creepy smell. Come on.

582
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,713
你想买栋旅馆吗
You out to buy a motel?

583
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,576
不是
No.

584
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,574
你刚才说这两天
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many

585
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,780
看了很多家旅馆  我在想你可能...
In the past couple of days, I thought maybe you...

586
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:28,518
你...你要问什么
What... What was it you wanted to ask?

587
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,390
我在找一个失踪的人
Well, you see, I'm looking for a missing person.

588
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:34,726
我叫阿伯盖斯特  私家侦探
My name's Arbogast. I'm a private investigator.

589
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:36,663
我一直在找一个女孩的下落
I've been trying to trace a girl

590
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:40,499
她在凤凰城失踪一个星期了
That's been missing for, oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

591
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:43,095
是家庭纠纷  他们已经原谅她了
It's a private matter. The family wants to forgive her.

592
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,300
她并没有任何麻烦
She's not in any trouble.

593
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,573
我想警察不会找没有惹麻烦的人
I didn't think the police went looking for people who aren't in trouble.

594
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:50,772
-我不是警察  -对啊
- I'm not the police. - Oh, yeah.

595
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,747
我们确信她走的是这条路
We have reason to believe that she came along this way.

596
01:05:52,816 --> 01:05:55,284
可能在这附近停留过  她来过这里吗
May have stopped in the area. Did she stop here?

597
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:57,912
我们这儿好几个礼拜没人来了
Well, no one's stopped here for a couple of weeks.

598
01:05:57,988 --> 01:06:00,320
你可不可以先看看照片再作证
Would you mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?

599
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,652
作证?
Commit myself?

600
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:03,386
你的口气真像警察
You sure talk like a policeman.

601
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,621
请认一下照片里的人
Look at the picture, please.

602
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:09,126
-确定吗  -确定
- Sure? - Yeah.

603
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,365
她可能用的是别名
Well, she may have used an alias.

604
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:13,902
曼璐・克兰才是她的真名
Marion Crane is her real name,

605
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,201
但她可能是用另一个名字登记的
But she could've registered under a different one.

606
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:21,802
老实讲  我甚至懒得再让客人登记
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother with guests registering anymore.

607
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:24,574
慢慢地就不再拘泥于形式
You know, one by one, you drop the formalities.

608
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:27,048
我甚至不该费时去换床单
I shouldn't even bother changing the sheets,

609
01:06:27,117 --> 01:06:29,381
然而积习难改
But old habits die hard.

610
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,248
这提醒了我...
Which reminds me...

611
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:33,587
那是什么
What's that?

612
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,386
旅馆的标志灯箱
It's the light. The sign.

613
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:38,357
上周有对夫妇说  如果那玩意儿没开着的话
We had a couple last week, said if the thing hadn't been on,

614
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,555
他们会以为这是间无人居住的旧...
They would've thought this was an old, deserted...

615
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,928
我也这么认为
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.

616
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,864
你说已经好几个礼拜没人来过这儿了
You said that nobody'd been here for a couple weeks,

617
01:06:44,935 --> 01:06:47,768
还有对夫妇经过并不知道你在营业
And there's a couple came by and didn't know that you were open.

618
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:48,826
对
Yeah.

619
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,239
正如你所言  积习难改
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.

620
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:54,209
有可能这个女孩是用化名来登记的
It's possible, this girl could've registered under another name.

621
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:55,938
介意我看一下登记簿吗
Do you mind if I look at your book?

622
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,946
-不介意  -谢谢
- No. - Thank you.

623
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:02,278
好的
All right.

624
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,547
从日期查起
I'll get the date somewhere.

625
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,649
瞧见了吧  没有此人
See, there's nobody.

626
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:11,490
我有她的笔迹样本  来对照一下
Let's see now, I have a sample of her handwriting here.

627
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:16,931
找到了
Here we are.

628
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:20,236
玛丽・萨米尔  有趣的化名
Marie Samuels. That's an interesting alias.

629
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:22,363
是她吗
Is that her?

630
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:23,701
是的  我想是的
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

631
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,798
玛丽  曼璐
Marie, Marion.

632
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,537
萨米尔  她男朋友叫萨姆
Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

633
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,571
她是否有可能乔装打扮过?
Was she in disguise, by any chance?

634
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:35,914
要再确认一下照片吗
Wanna check the picture again?

635
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:37,476
听着  我并没有对你撒谎  先生...
Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr...

636
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,613
我知道  我知道你没撒谎
Oh, I know that. I know you wouldn't lie.

637
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:41,554
时间久了记忆容易模糊
You know, it's tough keeping track of the time around here.

638
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,388
明白...
Oh, I know, I know.

639
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,752
记起来了
Oh, yeah.

640
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:47,990
那天下着雨
Well, it was raining

641
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:51,062
她的头发都湿透了
And her hair was all wet.

642
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:53,864
说实话  照片跟她本人真是相差甚远
I tell you, it's not really a very good picture of her either.

643
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:55,564
我想也是
No, I guess not.

644
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:57,163
跟我讲一下她吧
Tell me all about her.

645
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:03,241
那晚她来投宿已经相当晚了  所以直接就去睡了
She arrived rather late one night, and she went straight to sleep

646
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:06,009
第二天一早就退房了
And left early the next morning.

647
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,344
多早?
How early?

648
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,146
很早
Oh, very early.

649
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,481
哪天早上
Which morning was that?

650
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:18,160
第二天早上  是周日
The...The next morning. Sunday.

651
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:20,059
明白了
I see.

652
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,222
-有人跟她在这儿碰面吗  -没有
- Did anyone meet her here? - No.

653
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,062
有人跟她一起来吗
Did she arrive with anyone?

654
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:25,192
没有
No.

655
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:26,658
她有打过任何电话或是...
Did she make any phone calls or...

656
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:27,794
没有
No.

657
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,202
本地通话呢
Locally?

658
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,540
你跟她在一起过夜吗
Did you spend the night with her?

659
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,071
没有
No.

660
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:37,978
那你怎么知道她没打过电话
Well then, how would you know that she didn't make any phone calls?

661
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:43,619
她很累  然后...
Well, she was very tired and...

662
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:47,020
我开始记起来了
See, now I'm starting to remember.

663
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,682
我脑海里正在勾勒那个画面
I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.

664
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,623
如果你勾勒某个画面...
You know, if you make a mental picturization of something...

665
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:53,322
好...慢慢想
That's right. That's right. Take your time.

666
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:55,762
当时她...她就坐在后面...
She was... she was sitting back there...

667
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:58,767
不  不是  当时她手里拿着一个三明治站在后面
No, no, she was standing back there with a sandwich in her hand

668
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,496
还有她说她得早点去睡觉
And she said she had to go to sleep early

669
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:05,564
因为她还得开很远的路程
Because she had a long drive ahead of her.

670
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,177
-后面?  -回她要回的地方啊
- Back where? - Back where she came from.

671
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,217
不是  你之前说她坐在后面...
No, you said before that she was sitting back there...

672
01:09:10,217 --> 01:09:11,111
站在后面...
Standing back there...

673
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:13,615
是的  我后面的客厅里
Yes, back in my parlor there.

674
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,810
她很饿  然后我就给她做了个三明治
She was very hungry and I made her a sandwich

675
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:21,323
然后她说她很累就直接去睡了
And then she said that she was tired and she had to go right to bed.

676
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:24,991
-明白  她付现金还是支票?  -现金
- I see. How did she pay you? Cash? Check? - Cash.

677
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:26,392
现金
Cash, huh?

678
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,829
她离开之后  就没回来了吗
And after she left, she didn't come back?

679
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,161
她为什么要回来呢
Well, why should she?

680
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,967
我想就这么多了  阿伯盖斯特先生
Well, Mr. Arbogast, I guess that's about it.

681
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,304
如果你不介意的话  我先去忙了
I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.

682
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,405
说实话  我介意
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind.

683
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:49,612
如果做肉冻缺了凝结剂的话  就没法凝结
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

684
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,746
就做不成肉冻  缺一不可
It's not coming together. Something's missing.

685
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:56,681
我不知道你期望我告诉你些什么
Well, I don't know what you could expect me to know.

686
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,250
人们来来往往
People just come and go, you know.

687
01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:00,558
对  她不是还在这儿吧
That's right. She isn't still here, is she?

688
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,188
不在了
No.

689
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,969
如果我想要检查所有的房间
If I wanted to check the cabins, all 12 of them,

690
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,298
我是不是需要搜查令呀
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

691
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,156
如果你不信的话  就跟我来吧
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on with me.

692
01:10:10,156 --> 01:10:11,272
你可以帮我换床单
You can help me change beds.

693
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:13,901
不用了  多谢
Okay? Oh. no, thanks.

694
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,356
改变主意了?
Change your mind?

695
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,817
我...我想肯定是因为我的某些表情
You know, I... I think I must have one of those faces you just can't

696
01:10:39,817 --> 01:10:40,695
使得你不相信我的话
Help believing.

697
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,567
-还有人在家吗  -没有
- Is anyone at home? - No.

698
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:44,971
是吗  那儿有人坐在窗户旁边
Oh? There's somebody sitting up in the window.

699
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,235
没  没有
No, no, there isn't.

700
01:10:46,309 --> 01:10:47,401
肯定有  你去瞧瞧
Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

701
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,468
那肯定是我母亲
Oh, that must be my mother.

702
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:52,014
她是个病人
She's an invalid.

703
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,072
实际上  她喜欢独居
It's practically like living alone.

704
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,640
明白
Oh, I see.

705
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,786
如果这个女孩  曼璐・克兰在这儿
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here, you wouldn't

706
01:10:59,786 --> 01:11:01,289
你不会把她藏起来吧
Be hiding her, would you?

707
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:03,723
-不会  -即使她出高价也不会吗
- No. - Not even if she paid you well?

708
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:04,851
不会
No.

709
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:07,962
我们这样说好了  我不想跟你争论
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument,

710
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,625
她想要你勇敢地保护她
That she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

711
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,600
你知道你被利用了
You'd know that you were being used.

712
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:13,966
你不会蠢到被耍吧
You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?

713
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:15,629
但我并不傻  我...
But I'm not a fool. well, I...

714
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:18,765
我不能被别人愚弄  即便是被女人耍
And I'm not capable of being fooled, not even by a woman.

715
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,070
这不是在诋毁你的男子气概
Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.

716
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:21,303
这么说吧
Let's put it this way.

717
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:25,245
她可能耍了我  但她没有耍我的母亲
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.

718
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:27,249
那你母亲见过她了?  我可以跟你母亲谈一下吗
Well, then your mother met her. Could I talk to your mother?

719
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:29,979
不行  如我之前跟你说的  她不见外人
No. As I told you, she's confined.

720
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:31,350
知道  但就几分钟而已
Yes, but just for a few minutes. That's all.

721
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:33,514
可能会有你所遗漏的线索
There might be some hint that you missed out on.

722
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,922
生病的老女人通常比较易怒
You know, sick old women are usually pretty sharp.

723
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,459
阿伯盖斯特先生...我想我已经...
Mr. Arbogast... I think I've...

724
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:39,461
就一会儿  我不会触怒她的
Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.

725
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,196
我想我已经都跟你说清楚了
I think I've talked to you all I want to.

726
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:42,595
知道  但就...
Yes, but just for...

727
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,566
我想如果你马上离开就再好不过了  谢谢
I think it'd be much better if you left now. Thanks.

728
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,802
好吧
Well, all right.

729
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:51,769
如果你让我跟她谈一下肯定会让我少走很多冤枉路
You sure would save me a lot of leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

730
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:52,899
这也需要搜查令吗
Would I need a warrant for that, too?

731
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,204
当然
Sure.

732
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,572
好吧  不管怎样还是谢谢
All right. Thanks anyway.

733
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:54,862
喂  卢密斯  我是阿伯盖斯特  莱拉在吗
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

734
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,332
好  请让她听电话
Okay. Let me talk to her, please.

735
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,242
喂  莱拉
Hello, Lila.

736
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:03,674
听着  莱拉  曼璐来过这儿
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.

737
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:07,377
是的  上个星期六晚上她在贝茨汽车旅馆投宿
Yes, she spent last Saturday night at the Bates Motel.

738
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,247
就在旧公路旁边
It's right out here on the old highway.

739
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:12,777
我连她住哪个房间都知道  是1号房
I even know what cabin she was in. It was number one.

740
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:17,623
这个年轻的旅馆老板说她只住了一晚
This young fella that runs the place said that she just spent the night,

741
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:20,162
第二天就离开了  就这样
Left the next day and that was it.

742
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:24,360
还不大确定
No, not exactly.

743
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:27,609
相信我  我确实盘问过他
Well, I did question him, believe me,

744
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:29,972
但我认为我这趟没白来
But I think I got all there was to get.

745
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:33,236
我还得从这儿找点线索
I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here.

746
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:37,237
说实话  我感觉不是很满意...
Well, I tell you, I don't feel entirely satisfied...

747
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:39,679
这个小伙子有个生病的老母亲
See, this boy had a sick old mother.

748
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,684
我想她见过曼璐并跟她说过话
I think she saw Marion and talked to her.

749
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,983
没有  遗憾地是他不让我见她
No. No, unfortunately, he wouldn't let me see her.

750
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:50,188
我有  但我想会先回汽车旅馆
Well, I was, but I think I'll go back to the motel first.

751
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:54,755
不用  你跟卢密斯待一起  我大概1小时内回去
No, you stay there with Loomis. I'll be back in about an hour.

752
01:13:54,831 --> 01:13:56,924
好的  听着  我...
All right, fine. Listen, I...

753
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,525
你知道我的想法会很高兴的
You'll be happy to know what I think.

754
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:03,595
我想我们的朋友萨姆・卢密斯并不知道曼璐来这儿
I think our friend Sam Loomis didn't know that Marion was here.

755
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:08,436
好的  大概1小时左右见
Yeah. all right. See you in about an hour or less.

756
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
好的  再见
All right, bye bye.

757
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:07,430
贝茨?
Bates?

758
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,817
有时寂寞的声音会萦绕在周六的夜晚
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound.

759
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,986
有留意过吗  莱拉
Ever notice that, Lila?

760
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:49,694
萨姆  他说1小时左右
Sam, he said an hour or less.

761
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,596
对
Yeah.

762
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:54,664
已经过去3个小时了
It's been three.

763
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:56,898
难道我们就这样坐着干等吗
Well, are we just going to sit here and wait?

764
01:17:56,973 --> 01:17:58,531
他会回来的
He'll be back.

765
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,432
耐心等待吧
Let's sit still and hang on, okay?

766
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,410
旧公路有多远?
How far is the old highway?

767
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:10,179
你不会想要出去吧
You wanna go out there, don't you?

768
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:11,777
-找阿伯盖斯特跟那个老太太算账...  -是的
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady... - Yes.

769
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,515
-或许摇醒她  -是的
- Maybe shake her up. - Yes!

770
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,216
那可不是什么理智的行为
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

771
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,054
在我的家族字典里没有耐心两字
Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam.

772
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:18,753
-我要出去  -听着  阿伯盖斯特说过...
- I'm going out there. - Look, Arbogast said...

773
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:20,728
1个小时左右嘛
An hour, or less.

774
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:26,901
我走了
Well, I'm going.

775
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:28,664
你会迷路的
You'll never find it.

776
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:33,667
待在这儿
Stay here.

777
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:34,903
为什么我不可以跟你一起去
Why can't I go with you?

778
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:37,202
不知道  我们其中一个得留下
I don't know. One of us has to be here,

779
01:18:37,203 --> 01:18:38,743
说不定他已经在路上了
In case he's on the way.

780
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,009
我该做些什么  就这样坐着干等吗
What am I supposed to do, just sit here and wait?

781
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,914
对  待在这儿
Yeah. stay here.

782
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:04,936
阿伯盖斯特?
Arbogast?

783
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:07,674
阿伯盖斯特?
Arbogast!

784
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:12,414
阿伯盖斯特?
Arbogast!

785
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:43,569
他还没回来吗
He didn't come back here?

786
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:44,943
萨姆
Sam!

787
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:48,575
阿伯盖斯特跟贝茨都不在  只有一个老太太在家
No Arbogast, no Bates. Only the old lady at home.

788
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:51,620
病老太没法应门  或是不愿应门
Sick old lady unable to answer the door, or unwilling.

789
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:53,655
他会去哪儿了呢
Where could he have gone?

790
01:19:53,723 --> 01:19:54,934
也许他找到了一些确切的线索
Maybe he got some definite lead.

791
01:19:54,935 --> 01:19:55,918
就直奔线索而去了
Maybe he went right on.

792
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:57,118
不知会我一声?
Without calling me?

793
01:19:57,193 --> 01:19:58,251
走得太急了
In a hurry.

794
01:19:58,327 --> 01:19:59,794
萨姆  当时他什么线索都没有就打来了
Sam, he called when he had nothing.

795
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,387
什么都没  除了一股不满意的感觉
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

796
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:05,161
你不认为如果他发现了什么会打给我们吗
Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything at all?

797
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,826
是的  我想他会打来
Yes, I think he would've.

798
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:08,892
我们去见艾尔・钱伯斯吧
Let's go see Al Chambers.

799
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,029
他是谁
Who's he?

800
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,733
我们这儿的副警长
Our deputy sheriff around here.

801
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,604
好的  我去拿外套
All right. Let me get my coat.

802
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:23,318
晚上好
Good evening.

803
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:27,889
不知道该从何说起  直接切入主题吧
Well, I don't know where to start, except at the beginning.

804
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:29,049
好
Yes.

805
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:31,181
这位是来自凤凰城的莱拉・克兰
This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.

806
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,057
你好
How do you do?

807
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,460
她来这儿是为了找她妹妹的
She's been here searching for her sister.

808
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:38,159
请了一位私家侦探帮忙...
There's this private detective helping and...

809
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:40,293
我们接到那个私家侦探打来的电话
Well, we got a call from this detective

810
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,769
说他在那家旧公路旁的汽车旅馆追查到她的消息
Saying that he'd traced her to that motel out on the old highway.

811
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,806
那肯定是贝茨汽车旅馆
That must be the Bates Motel.

812
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:45,560
他查到她住过那儿
He traced her there

813
01:20:45,561 --> 01:20:47,775
然后打给我们说他要去盘问贝茨太太
and called us to say he was going to question Mrs.Bates.

814
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,435
诺曼结婚了?
Norman took a wife?

815
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:52,845
不是  我想没有  是位老太太  他的母亲
No, I don't think so. An old woman. His mother.

816
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:54,718
不管是谁  自从挂完电话后
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.

817
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,343
我们就跟他失去了联系
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

818
01:20:56,419 --> 01:20:59,946
你妹妹失踪多久了
Now, your sister's missing how long?

819
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:03,219
到昨天为止  她已经失踪1个星期了
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday, without a trace.

820
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:06,784
你跟那位侦探怎么会追查到菲尔威尔的
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?

821
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,057
他们以为她来找我了
They thought she'd be coming to me.

822
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:10,257
她是独自离开凤凰城的吗
Left Phoenix under her own steam?

823
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,492
是的
Yes.

824
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:14,161
她不像是失踪倒像是逃跑
She's not missing so much as she's run away.

825
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,294
对
That's right.

826
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,497
为什么
From what?

827
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:20,601
她偷了些钱
She stole some money.

828
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:22,007
很多吗
A lot?

829
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:25,377
4万块钱
$40,000.

830
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,573
那警方没有...
And the police haven't been able to...

831
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:28,997
大家考虑到...
Everyone concerned thought

832
01:21:28,998 --> 01:21:31,484
如果他们能让她把钱还回去的话
If they could get her to give the money back,

833
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:34,022
他们可以避免她被抓进警局
They could avoid involving her with the police.

834
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,058
所以才请私家侦探
That explains the private detective.

835
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:38,026
他追查到她曾住在贝茨旅馆
He traced her to the Bates place.

836
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:40,562
他打电话给你具体说了些什么
What exactly did he say when he called you?

837
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:44,497
他说曼璐在那儿住了一晚就走了
Well, he said that Marion was there for one night and then she left.

838
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,262
带着4万块钱?
With the $40,000?

839
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:49,096
钱的事他只字未提
Well, he didn't say anything about the money.

840
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:51,571
电话内容无关紧要  是吗
It isn't important what he said on the phone, is it?

841
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,232
在他跟那位母亲谈完话之后
He was supposed to come back here and talk to us

842
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:55,402
他本该回到这儿跟我们碰面  但他并没回来
After he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

843
01:21:55,478 --> 01:21:57,708
所以我才找你介入调查此事
That's what I want you to do something about.

844
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,270
调查什么
Like what?

845
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:01,810
抱歉我说话急了点
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

846
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:03,191
只是我敢肯定那儿
It's just that I'm sure there's

847
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:05,581
有什么不对劲  并且我必须调查清楚
something wrong out there and I have to know what.

848
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:07,966
我也觉得那儿不对劲
Well, I think there's something wrong too, Miss,

849
01:22:07,967 --> 01:22:09,146
但不是同一件事
but not the same thing.

850
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:12,388
我想不对劲的是你的私家侦探
I think what's wrong is your private detective.

851
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:16,488
我想他可能从诺曼・贝茨那儿
I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going,

852
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:18,658
知道你妹妹去向的重要线索
Probably from Norman Bates,

853
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:20,511
然后打给你  让你们继续等消息
And called you to keep you still

854
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:22,898
而他就出发去追她和钱
While he took off after her and the money.

855
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:26,840
不会的  他说他还没调查清楚会再回来
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied and he was going back there.

856
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:29,309
为什么不打给诺曼  问他说到底发生了什么事
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened?

857
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:30,743
现在吗
At this hour?

858
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:33,043
我刚从那儿回来  他出去了
Well, he was out when I was there just a while ago.

859
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,174
如果他回来了  可能还没睡
If he's back, he probably isn't even in bed yet.

860
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:36,809
你去的时候他在家
He wasn't out when you were there,

861
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:37,412
夜阑人静
He just wasn't

862
01:22:37,412 --> 01:22:40,219
像某些人一样  不应门罢了
answering the door in the dead of night, like some people do.

863
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,553
这个小伙子像位隐士
This fellow lives like a hermit.

864
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:45,753
你肯定还记得10年前发生的那件不幸的事
You must remember that bad business out there about 10 years ago.

865
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,489
求你打一下吧
Please. Call.

866
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:57,900
弗洛里  警长让你连线贝茨汽车旅馆
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to connect him with the Bates Motel.

867
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,573
喂  是诺曼吗  我是钱伯斯警长
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

868
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,979
我很好  谢谢
I've been just fine, thanks.

869
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:12,213
听着  我们这儿出了点事
Listen, we got worries here.

870
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,257
今晚是否有个男的去过你那儿
Yeah, have you had a fella stop by there tonight...

871
01:23:17,393 --> 01:23:19,759
他不是来投宿的
Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway.

872
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,125
他是位私家侦探  名字叫...
He's a private detective, name of...

873
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:22,789
阿伯盖斯特
Arbogast.

874
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:24,423
叫阿伯盖斯特
Arbogast.

875
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:29,904
他离开之后呢
And after he left?

876
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:34,072
没关系  诺曼
No, that's okay, Norman.

877
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:39,512
这位侦探去过那儿  诺曼跟他讲了那个女孩的事
This detective was there, Norman told him about the girl,

878
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:42,483
侦探谢过他之后就走了
The detective thanked him and he went away.

879
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:46,484
他没再回去吗  他没去见那位母亲吗
And he didn't come back? He didn't see the mother?

880
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:48,819
你的侦探告诉你  他不能马上回来
Your detective told you he couldn't come right back

881
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:52,827
因为他要去盘问诺曼・贝茨的母亲  是吗
Because he was going to question Norman Bates's mother, right?

882
01:23:52,895 --> 01:23:54,021
是的
Yes.

883
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:57,461
诺曼・贝茨的母亲10年前就去世了
Norman Bates's mother has been dead and buried

884
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:00,559
并安葬在绿色草坪墓地
In Green Lawn cemetery for the past 10 years.

885
01:24:02,071 --> 01:24:04,869
她被安葬时所穿的寿衣还是我帮诺曼选的
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in.

886
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:05,802
浅紫光蓝色
Periwinkle blue.

887
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,535
那不只是地方历史事件
It ain't only local history, Sam.

888
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:11,444
也是菲尔威尔地区唯一一起谋杀跟自杀案
It's the only case of murder and suicide on Fairvale Ledgers.

889
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:15,973
当贝茨太太发现跟她交往的家伙已有家室
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was involved with

890
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,315
她就把他毒死了
When she found out he was married.

891
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,481
然后她也服毒自杀了
Then took a helping of the same stuff herself.

892
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:24,492
是番木鳖碱  死得很难看
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

893
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:27,758
诺曼发现他们死在一起
Norman found them dead together.

894
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,320
在床上
In bed.

895
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,865
你是说我见到的那个坐在窗边的老妇人
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in the window out there wasn't

896
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:33,492
不是贝茨的母亲吗
Bates' mother?

897
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:37,801
等等  萨姆  你肯定见过一位老妇人吗
Now, wait a minute, Sam. Are you sure you saw an old woman?

898
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:40,341
是的  在汽车旅馆后面的房子里
Yes! In the house behind the motel!

899
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,707
我去叫门  但她根本不理我
I called and pounded but she just ignored me!

900
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:45,542
你是想告诉我  你见到了诺曼・贝茨的母亲  对吗
You want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother?

901
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:48,845
但她肯定是  因为阿伯盖斯特也这么说
But it had to be because Arbogast said so, too!

902
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:52,614
那个年轻人不让他去见她  是因为她病得很重
And the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was too ill.

903
01:24:52,688 --> 01:24:55,555
好吧  如果那位妇人是贝茨太太
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs. Bates,

904
01:24:56,892 --> 01:25:00,225
那埋在绿草坪墓地的又是谁呢
Who's that woman buried out in Green Lawn cemetery?

905
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:46,940
母亲  我现在要提出...
Now, mother, I'm gonna bring something up...

906
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,872
抱歉  孩子
I am sorry, boy,

907
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:53,608
但你命令我时  看起来确实很可笑
But you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders.

908
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:55,309
求您了  母亲
Please, mother.

909
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:58,319
不行  我不会藏在果窖里
No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

910
01:25:59,722 --> 01:26:01,883
你觉得我疯了  对吗
You think I'm fruity, huh?

911
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:04,084
我就待在这儿
I'm staying right here.

912
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,992
这是我的房间  谁也别想把我赶走
This is my room and no one will drag me out of it,

913
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:10,155
我无耻的儿子更不行
Least of all my big, bold son.

914
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:11,358
他们会来这儿的  母亲
They'll come now, mother.

915
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:15,369
他跟踪过那个姑娘  现在有人要跟踪他
He came after the girl, and now someone will come after him.

916
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:17,200
母亲  求您了  几天就好
Mother, please, it's just for a few days.

917
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:19,706
这样他们就找不到您了
Just for a few days so they won't find you.

918
01:26:19,775 --> 01:26:21,709
几天就好吗
Just for a few days?

919
01:26:22,044 --> 01:26:25,309
在这阴暗潮湿的果窖?  决不
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!

920
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:29,315
你曾把我藏在那里  孩子  你休想再让我去那儿了  绝不
You hid me there once, boy, and you won't do it again, not ever again!

921
01:26:29,385 --> 01:26:30,943
现在滚蛋
Now get out!

922
01:26:32,488 --> 01:26:34,353
我让你滚蛋  小子
I told you to get out, boy.

923
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:36,254
我把您抱下去  母亲
I'll carry you, mother.

924
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:39,294
诺曼  你想干什么
Norman, what do you think you're doing?

925
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:42,592
别碰我  诺曼
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!

926
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:51,233
把我放下  放下我  我自己能走
Put me down! Put me down! I can walk on my own.

927
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:00,842
早上好  早上好
Good morning. Good morning.

928
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:02,406
早上好
Good morning.

929
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:04,782
如果您不介意  我们愿驾车带您去那间旅馆
We thought if you didn't mind, we'd drive out to that motel with you.

930
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:05,877
他已经去过了
He's already been.

931
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:07,148
在仪式之前离开的
Went out before service.

932
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,382
你们俩吃过早餐了吗
Did you two have breakfast?

933
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:09,754
什么也没发现吗
You didn't find anything?

934
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:12,760
没有  我们别挡道
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.

935
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:15,995
他说了什么关于我妹妹的事吗
Well, what did he say about my sister?

936
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:19,261
和他向你的侦探说的一样  她用了匿名
Just what he told your detective, she used a fake name.

937
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,562
我看过了登记簿
Saw the register myself.

938
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:23,605
看过了整个地方  事实上  那小伙子一个人住在那儿
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact. That boy's alone there.

939
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:25,037
他母亲不在吗
No mother?

940
01:27:25,107 --> 01:27:26,665
肯定是你的幻觉  萨姆
You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

941
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:29,643
我知道你不会产生幻觉
I know you're not the seeing illusion's type,

942
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:32,202
但那儿没有女人  而且我不相信鬼神之说
But no woman was there and I don't believe in ghosts,

943
01:27:32,281 --> 01:27:34,146
-就是这样  -我仍然觉得那儿有...
- So there it is. - I still feel that there's something...

944
01:27:34,216 --> 01:27:37,845
我理解你的感受  很抱歉不能让你好受些
Can see you do. I'm sorry l couldn't make you feel better.

945
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,649
你今天下午来我办公室
You want to come around to my office this afternoon

946
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:42,849
填一份失踪人口及遭遇抢劫的报告  这才是你要做的
And report a missing person and a theft, that's what you want to do.

947
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,916
你越快把此事交由法办
The sooner you drop this in the lap of the law,

948
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:48,861
就越有可能快点找到你妹妹
That's the sooner you stand a chance of your sister being picked up.

949
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,523
怎么样
How about that?

950
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:52,294
我不知道
I don't know.

951
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:53,527
今天是周日
It's Sunday.

952
01:27:54,236 --> 01:27:56,727
晚饭时来我家填报告吧
Come on over to the house and do your reporting around dinnertime.

953
01:27:56,805 --> 01:27:58,602
这样会比较好
It'll make it nicer.

954
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:00,539
你也来吧  萨姆
You too, Sam.

955
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,701
谢谢
Thank you.

956
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:06,176
也许我真的会产生幻觉
Maybe I am the seeing illusions type.

957
01:28:06,248 --> 01:28:07,738
不  你不会
No, you're not.

958
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:10,647
好吧  你想让我把你送回旅馆还是...
Well, you want me to drop you at the hotel or...

959
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:11,743
萨姆
Sam.

960
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:15,187
在没亲自去过那里之前  我不会罢休的
I still won't feel satisfied until I go out there.

961
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:18,450
我也不会  走吧
Neither will I. Come on.

962
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:23,927
我们最好想想到了那儿要怎么做
We better decide what we're gonna say or do when we walk in there.

963
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:26,297
我们先去注册结婚
We're going to register as man and wife.

964
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,962
再去他那儿租间房
We're going to get shown to a cabin,

965
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:33,373
之后我们要调查那儿的每个角落  从里到外
And then we're going to search every inch of the place, inside and out.

966
01:28:57,299 --> 01:28:59,096
我想知道诺曼・贝茨在哪儿隐居
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting.

967
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,658
有人在窗户那儿  我看到窗帘动了
Someone's at that window. I just saw the curtain move.

968
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:03,034
过来
Come on.

969
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,035
什么事
Well?

970
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:08,303
正想给你打电话
Just coming up to ring for you.

971
01:29:09,611 --> 01:29:10,942
我猜你们想住店
Suppose you want a room.

972
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:12,776
我们本想直接去旧金山
We were gonna try to make it straight to San Francisco,

973
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,975
但是我们看了看天
But we don't like the look of that sky.

974
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,483
感觉马上要变天了  对吧
Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?

975
01:29:16,552 --> 01:29:18,213
好吧
Okay.

976
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,220
我带你们去10号房间
I'll take you to cabin 10.

977
01:29:26,295 --> 01:29:27,626
我们最好还是先登记  对吧
Better sign in first, hadn't we?

978
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,630
不  没必要
No. That's not necessary.

979
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:33,725
我的老板会为此次旅行买单  90%可以报销
My boss is paying for this trip and, well, it's 90% business.

980
01:29:33,802 --> 01:29:36,566
但他需要正式发票
He wants practically notarized receipts.

981
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:39,266
我们最好登记  并拿到发票
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.

982
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,357
谢谢
Thank you.

983
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:04,631
-我帮你们去拿行李  -我们没行李
- I'll get your bags. - Haven't any.

984
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:08,500
那我带你们看一下房间
I'll show you the room, then.

985
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,333
头回看到你这么开旅店
First time I've ever seen it happen.

986
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,373
在美国的其他旅店  没有行李的旅客必须登记
You check in any other place in this country without bags

987
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:14,500
而且要付定金
And you have to pay in advance.

988
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:15,804
10美元
$10.

989
01:30:23,352 --> 01:30:24,876
我的发票
That receipt.

990
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:32,555
我先去看看
I'll go on ahead.

991
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,294
好了  这是您的发票  那么  我来给您带路
All right, there's your receipt. Now, I'll show you the cabin.

992
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:44,066
不麻烦了  我们自己能找到
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

993
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:04,455
萨姆  我们必须去调查那个房间
Sam, we have to go into that cabin and search it,

994
01:31:04,526 --> 01:31:08,053
无论我们多么害怕  或者付出多大代价
No matter what we're afraid of finding or how much it may hurt.

995
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,358
知道了
I know.

996
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:11,694
如果真有事  你觉得那儿会是事发地点吗
Do you think if something happened, it happened there?

997
01:31:11,767 --> 01:31:13,257
我不知道
I don't know.

998
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:16,093
但如果你有一家这样不赚钱的旅店
But if you had a useless business like this motel,

999
01:31:16,171 --> 01:31:17,365
需要什么把它脱手
What would you need to get out?

1000
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:19,498
然后在别的地方再开一家新的呢
To get a new business somewhere else?

1001
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:20,939
4万块钱?
$40,000?

1002
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:25,772
你如何证明这点
How could we prove that...

1003
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:28,441
如果他在新高速路上开了家汽车旅店  一年后...
Well, if he opens a motel on the new highway in, say, a year...

1004
01:31:28,517 --> 01:31:31,008
这儿一定有证据
There must be some proof that exists now,

1005
01:31:31,086 --> 01:31:34,647
一定有能证明他抢走了曼璐钱的证据
Something that proves he got that money away from Marion somehow.

1006
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:36,247
你凭什么那么肯定
What makes you sound so certain?

1007
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,349
阿伯盖斯特  她喜欢我  萨姆
Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

1008
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:40,972
或者他对我感到愧疚  对你
Or he felt sorry for me and he was

1009
01:31:40,972 --> 01:31:42,921
他亦是如此
Beginning to feel the same way about you.

1010
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:45,728
从上次和他通话就可以证明
I could tell the last time I talked to him on the phone.

1011
01:31:45,801 --> 01:31:47,132
在去任何地方  或是作任何事情前
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

1012
01:31:47,202 --> 01:31:49,932
他一定会通知我们  除非有人阻止了他
Or done anything without telling us, unless he was stopped.

1013
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:53,839
如果有人阻止了他  说明他一定发现了什么
And he was stopped. So he must have found out something.

1014
01:31:56,044 --> 01:31:58,205
我们从1号房间开始调查
We'll start with cabin one.

1015
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:03,550
如果他看到我们  咱们就假装在散步
If he sees us, we're just taking the air.

1016
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,744
贝茨
Bates.

1017
01:33:27,202 --> 01:33:29,500
-没有浴帘  -萨姆
- No shower curtain. - Sam!

1018
01:33:29,571 --> 01:33:30,697
看  这是什么
Look! What is it?

1019
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:33,138
是数字  它没被冲掉  看
It's figuring. It didn't get washed down. Look.

1020
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:37,042
一些数字是用4万加减得来的
Some figure has been added to or subtracted from 40,000.

1021
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,340
这证明曼璐来过这儿
That proves Marion was here.

1022
01:33:38,413 --> 01:33:39,710
这太巧了
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

1023
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,772
贝茨从未否认她来过这儿
Bates never denied she was here.

1024
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,809
这不能证明他找到了那些钱吗
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out about the money?

1025
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:46,581
我们要直接去问他把钱藏哪儿了吗
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

1026
01:33:46,655 --> 01:33:47,679
不
No.

1027
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:51,248
但那老妇人  无论她是谁  她曾告诉过阿伯盖斯特一些事
But that old woman, whoever she is, she told Arbogast something.

1028
01:33:51,326 --> 01:33:53,988
我想让她也把那些告诉我们
I want her to tell us the same thing.

1029
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:55,554
你不能上去
You can't go up there.

1030
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,120
为什么
Why not?

1031
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,167
-因为贝茨  -那我们去找他
- Bates. - Well, let's find him.

1032
01:33:59,234 --> 01:34:01,930
我们其中一人把他稳住  另一人去找那位老妇人
One of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the old woman.

1033
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:05,063
如果他不愿意　你一定稳不住他
You'll never be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held.

1034
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,835
我不想让你独自去他的房间
I don't like you going into that house alone.

1035
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:10,036
但我能应付那个老病妇
I can handle a sick old woman.

1036
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:13,677
好吧　我去把贝茨稳住
All right, I'll find bates and keep him occupied.

1037
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:15,773
等等
Wait a minute.

1038
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:19,013
如果你从那妇人嘴里得知了什么后
If you get anything out of the mother,

1039
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:21,916
能找到回城的路吗
Can you find your way back to town?

1040
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,548
是的　当然
Yes, of course.

1041
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:27,523
如果你真的得到了重要证据　不必来通知我
If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.

1042
01:34:50,585 --> 01:34:51,950
你在找我吗
You looking for me?

1043
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,647
-什么事　-是的　事实上
- Why - Yes, as a matter of fact.

1044
01:34:53,722 --> 01:34:55,383
我的妻子在睡觉
Wife's taking a nap

1045
01:34:55,457 --> 01:34:57,652
但我可能会吵到她
And I never can keep quiet enough for her,

1046
01:34:57,726 --> 01:34:59,387
所以我来找你聊聊天
So I just thought I'd look you up and talk.

1047
01:34:59,461 --> 01:35:01,691
很好　你对房间还满意吗
Good. You satisfied with your cabin?

1048
01:35:01,763 --> 01:35:03,321
很好
Oh, it's fine.

1049
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:20,099
这么半天　都是我在讲话　对吧
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?

1050
01:36:20,175 --> 01:36:22,234
我原本认为总是独处的人
I thought it was the people who were alone most of the time

1051
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,608
一旦有谈话的机会　会滔滔不绝
Who did all the talking when they got the chance.

1052
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:26,840
而你却一言不发
Here you are doing all the listening.

1053
01:36:26,915 --> 01:36:29,281
你一个人住在这儿　对吧
You are alone here, aren't you?

1054
01:36:29,351 --> 01:36:30,943
这会让我发疯的
Drive me crazy.

1055
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:35,017
我觉得你的反应太极端了　对吧
I think that would be a rather extreme reaction, don't you?

1056
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,648
这只是种修辞手法
Just an expression.

1057
01:36:36,725 --> 01:36:40,217
我是说　无论如何我也会离开
What I meant was I'd do just about anything to get away.

1058
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:42,058
-你不会吗　-不会
- Wouldn't you? - No.

1059
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:49,602
贝茨太太?
Mrs. Bates?

1060
01:38:06,548 --> 01:38:08,982
我不是说你住在这里不应该感到满足
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here,

1061
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,950
我只是不敢相信你会很满足
I'm just doubting that you are.

1062
01:38:11,019 --> 01:38:13,656
我觉得如果你有机会摆脱困境  你肯定会
I think if you saw a chance to get out from under, you.

1063
01:38:13,656 --> 01:38:14,682
把这旅店脱手
Do unload this place.

1064
01:38:14,756 --> 01:38:18,089
这里吗  这旅店是我的全部
This place? This place happens to be my only world.

1065
01:38:19,127 --> 01:38:22,528
我在这里长大  在这里度过了快乐的童年
I grew up in that house up there. I had a very happy childhood.

1066
01:38:22,597 --> 01:38:24,224
我和母亲生活的非常幸福
My mother and I were more than happy.

1067
01:39:26,227 --> 01:39:28,627
你害怕了  是我的话让你害怕了吗
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?

1068
01:39:28,696 --> 01:39:30,220
我不知道你在说些什么
I don't know what you.ve been saying.

1069
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:33,563
我在说你母亲  还有你的汽车旅馆
I've been talking about your mother, about your motel.

1070
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:34,693
你要如何处理它
How you gonna do it?

1071
01:39:34,769 --> 01:39:35,895
处理什么
Do what?

1072
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,905
去个新地方再买一家吗  这样你就不必藏起你的母亲了
Buy a new one in a new town where you won't have to hide your mother.

1073
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,737
请你立刻开车离开这儿  好吗
Why don't you just get in your car and drive away from here, okay?

1074
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,777
你哪儿来的钱去做那些  贝茨
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates?

1075
01:39:43,845 --> 01:39:45,813
你是否已经把钱存起来了
Or do you already have it socked away?

1076
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:46,869
闭嘴
Shut up!

1077
01:39:46,948 --> 01:39:48,745
很多钱  4万块钱
A lot of it. $40,000.

1078
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,978
我打赌你妈妈知道钱在哪儿  也知道钱是怎么来的
I bet your mother knows where the money is and what you did to get it.

1079
01:39:56,057 --> 01:39:58,048
我想她会告诉我们的
I think she'll tell us.

1080
01:39:59,928 --> 01:40:03,420
跟你一起来的女孩呢  她在哪儿
Where's that girl you came here with? Where is she?

1081
01:41:08,296 --> 01:41:09,854
贝茨太太
Mrs. Bates...

1082
01:41:30,051 --> 01:41:31,780
我就是诺曼・贝茨
I'm Norman Bates!

1083
01:42:03,017 --> 01:42:06,214
如果谁能猜到答案  那他一定能当心理学家了
If anyone gets any answers it'll be the psychiatrist.

1084
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:08,983
就连我也搞不懂他  而且他还认识我
Even I couldn't get to Norman and he knows me.

1085
01:42:09,057 --> 01:42:11,321
-你不冷吗  小姐  -不冷
- You warm enough, miss? - Yes.

1086
01:42:12,327 --> 01:42:14,192
他跟你谈过了吗
Did he talk to you?

1087
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:16,189
没有
No.

1088
01:42:17,999 --> 01:42:23,301
我得知了一切  但不是从诺曼那里  是从他妈妈那儿
I got the whole story, but not from Norman. I got it from his mother.

1089
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:27,007
诺曼・贝茨已经不存在了
Norman Bates no longer exists.

1090
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:30,705
他本来还有一半尚存
He only half existed to begin with.

1091
01:42:30,778 --> 01:42:33,679
现在另一半完全占据了他
And now the other half has taken over,

1092
01:42:35,183 --> 01:42:37,276
或许一直如此
Probably for all time.

1093
01:42:39,387 --> 01:42:41,218
是他杀了我妹妹吗
Did he kill my sister?

1094
01:42:41,289 --> 01:42:43,154
是
Yes.

1095
01:42:43,224 --> 01:42:44,316
也不是
And no.

1096
01:42:44,859 --> 01:42:47,987
听着  如果你想为我们打精神病学的铺垫
Well, now look, if you're trying to lay some psychiatric groundwork

1097
01:42:48,062 --> 01:42:50,326
这位伙计更愿意去抓...
For some sort of plea, this fellow would like to cop...

1098
01:42:50,398 --> 01:42:53,265
精神病学家不做任何铺垫
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.

1099
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:55,666
他们仅仅想解释缘由
He merely tries to explain it.

1100
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:58,500
-但我妹妹...  -是啊
- But my sister is... - Yes.

1101
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:03,469
是啊  我很遗憾
Yes, I'm sorry.

1102
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:06,274
你的私家侦探也很遗憾
The private investigator, too.

1103
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:10,875
如果你去调查汽车旅馆附近的沼泽  你就会...
If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

1104
01:43:14,422 --> 01:43:17,550
你是否有失踪人口案件仍然在册
Have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books?

1105
01:43:17,625 --> 01:43:19,149
是的  有两个
Yes, two.

1106
01:43:19,227 --> 01:43:20,387
都是年轻女孩吗
Young girls?

1107
01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:21,986
他是不是已经承认...
Did he confess to...

1108
01:43:22,063 --> 01:43:24,122
-就像我说的  -那位母亲
- Like I said, - The mother.

1109
01:43:26,734 --> 01:43:30,693
现在  我从他母亲那儿得到信息的方式是这样的
Now, to understand it the way I understood it, hearing it from the mother,

1110
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:34,337
说道诺曼人格中母亲的那部分
That is, from the mother half of Norman's mind,

1111
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:37,376
我们须从10年前谈起
You have to go back 10 years

1112
01:43:37,845 --> 01:43:41,246
那时  诺曼杀了他的母亲及她的情人
To the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover.

1113
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:43,715
自从他父亲去世后
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,

1114
01:43:43,785 --> 01:43:46,185
他的精神就极度紊乱了
Had been ever since his father died.

1115
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,816
他的母亲  是一位执着而且苛刻的女性
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman,

1116
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:54,462
他们两个多年来就好像生活在
And for years the two of them lived

1117
01:43:54,462 --> 01:43:57,025
没有其他人的世界里
As if there was no one else in the world.

1118
01:43:57,432 --> 01:43:59,229
然后  她爱上了一个男人
Then she met a man,

1119
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:03,602
对于诺曼  感觉就像她为了那个男人把自己抛弃了
And it seemed to Norman that she threw him over for this man.

1120
01:44:04,372 --> 01:44:08,103
这让他无法忍受  最终将二人全部杀死
Now, that pushed him over the line and he killed them both.

1121
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:12,440
弑母大概是最无法令人忍受的犯罪了
Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all,

1122
01:44:13,915 --> 01:44:16,884
尤其是儿子亲手杀了母亲
Most unbearable to the son who commits it.

1123
01:44:17,852 --> 01:44:22,619
因此  他必须洗清罪恶  至少在他的思想中要这样
So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind.

1124
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:27,457
他偷走了她的尸体
He stole her corpse.

1125
01:44:30,031 --> 01:44:32,329
棺材下葬时装的是其他重物
A weighted coffin was buried.

1126
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,694
他把尸体藏在了果窖
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

1127
01:44:36,137 --> 01:44:39,038
并十分妥善地保存着它
Even treated it to keep it as well as it would keep.

1128
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:41,336
但这还不够
And that still wasn't enough.

1129
01:44:42,143 --> 01:44:45,772
她人虽在那里  但却成了一具尸体
She was there, but she was a corpse.

1130
01:44:48,316 --> 01:44:51,114
所以他开始以母亲的方式思考  说话
So he began to think and speak for her,

1131
01:44:51,185 --> 01:44:53,745
可以说  他把自己的一半给了他母亲
Give her half his life, so to speak.

1132
01:44:54,355 --> 01:44:58,382
有时  他的两种人格同时存在  可以形成对话
At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations.

1133
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:02,952
而其他的时候  他母亲的人格完全占据了他
At other times, the mother half took over completely.

1134
01:45:03,431 --> 01:45:08,198
他再也不完全是诺曼了  大部分时间他是自己的母亲
He was never all Norman, but he was often only mother,

1135
01:45:09,604 --> 01:45:12,971
因为他是如此病态地妒忌着自己的母亲
And because he was so pathologically jealous of her,

1136
01:45:13,441 --> 01:45:15,932
所以他认为母亲也同样妒忌着他
He assumed that she was as jealous of him.

1137
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:20,572
因此  如果他被其他女人深深吸引
Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman,

1138
01:45:21,582 --> 01:45:24,312
他"母亲"的一面就会发狂
The mother side of him would go wild.

1139
01:45:27,588 --> 01:45:29,613
当他遇到你妹妹时
When he met your sister,

1140
01:45:30,992 --> 01:45:33,290
就被她深深触动  深深吸引
He was touched by her, aroused by her.

1141
01:45:33,361 --> 01:45:34,885
他想要她
He wanted her.

1142
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:41,160
这激怒了他"母亲"的一面  然后他"母亲"杀了那姑娘
That set off the jealous mother, and mother killed the girl.

1143
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:46,434
杀完人后  诺曼如梦方醒
After the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,

1144
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:50,977
变回了那个忠诚的儿子  并掩盖掉一切罪行
And, like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime

1145
01:45:51,045 --> 01:45:53,673
他确信杀人的是他母亲
He was convinced his mother had committed!

1146
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:56,114
他为什么要穿成那样
Why was he dressed like that?

1147
01:45:56,551 --> 01:45:58,451
他是个异装癖
He's a transvestite.

1148
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:00,887
并不确切
Not exactly.

1149
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:04,958
为了达到改变性别或者自我满足
A man who dresses in women's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change

1150
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:07,494
而穿上女人服饰的男人被称作异装癖
Or satisfaction is a transvestite.

1151
01:46:07,562 --> 01:46:12,090
但对于诺曼而言  他只是想竭尽全力去维持
But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible

1152
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:15,658
自己母亲还活着的这一幻觉
To keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive.

1153
01:46:16,971 --> 01:46:19,531
而当现实逼近时
And when reality came too close,

1154
01:46:19,607 --> 01:46:23,168
当危险或者欲望要吞噬这个幻觉时
When danger or desire threatened that illusion,

1155
01:46:25,513 --> 01:46:28,641
他就会穿上女人服饰  甚至戴上假发
He'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he bought.

1156
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:32,812
在屋子里徘徊  坐在母亲的椅子上  用母亲的腔调说话
He'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

1157
01:46:32,887 --> 01:46:35,117
他试着成为自己的母亲
He tried to be his mother.

1158
01:46:37,024 --> 01:46:39,686
现在  他做到了
And now he is.

1159
01:46:41,596 --> 01:46:44,895
这就是我说  是从他母亲那里得知一切的原因
That's what I meant when I said I got the story from the mother.

1160
01:46:44,966 --> 01:46:48,197
当人们脑海中出现双重人格时
You see, when the mind houses two personalities,

1161
01:46:48,803 --> 01:46:51,431
就一定会有冲突  甚至战争
There's always a conflict, a battle.

1162
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,238
对于诺曼而言  战争已经结束
In Norman's case, the battle is over,

1163
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:58,511
较为强势的人格获胜
And the dominant personality has won.

1164
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:01,377
那4万块钱呢  谁拿走了
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1165
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:06,179
在沼泽里  这次犯罪源于人格分裂  而非图财
The swamp. These were crimes of passion, not profit.

1166
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:12,153
他觉得有点冷  我能把毯子给他吗
He feels a little chill. Can I bring him this blanket?

1167
01:47:12,226 --> 01:47:14,194
当然  可以
Oh, sure. All right.

1168
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:28,598
谢谢
Thank you.

1169
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:38,847
当一位母亲不得不谴责自己的儿子时
It's sad when a mother has to speak the words

1170
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,944
是多么悲哀啊
That condemn her own son,

1171
01:47:41,022 --> 01:47:44,856
但我不会让他们认为是我杀的人
But I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder,

1172
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:48,759
他们会抛弃他的  就像我数年前应该做的那样
They'll put him away now, as I should have years ago,

1173
01:47:49,497 --> 01:47:51,624
他一向很坏
He was always bad,

1174
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:56,727
最终  他打算告诉警察是我杀的那些女孩和那个男人
And in the end he intended to tell them I killed those girls and that man,

1175
01:47:56,804 --> 01:48:00,570
除了端坐和凝视外  我什么也做不了
As if I could do anything except just sit and stare,

1176
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:03,041
就像他的标本鸟一样
Like one of his stuffed birds,

1177
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:07,303
他们知道  我连手指都动不了  而且我也不会
They know I can't even move a finger, and I won't,

1178
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:12,978
我只会在这里静静端坐  以免被人怀疑
I'll just sit here and be quiet, just in case they do suspect me,

1179
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:19,255
他们大概会监视我  好吧  让他们看吧
They're probably watching me, well, let them,

1180
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,660
让他们看看我是什么样的人
Let them see what kind of a person I am,

1181
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:26,332
我甚至不会拍死这只苍蝇
I'm not even gonna swat that fly,

1182
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,130
我希望他们在监视我  他们就会看到
I hope they are watching, they'll see,

1183
01:48:29,637 --> 01:48:31,332
他们会看到并且明白
They'll see and they'll know,

1184
01:48:31,405 --> 01:48:35,933
之后  他们会说"为什么  她连苍蝇都不愿伤害啊"
And they'll say, ''why, she wouldn't even harm a fly, ''
