1
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:15,911
You never did eat your lunch, did you?

2
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:19,076
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

3
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:21,130
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,065
Why don't you call your boss and tell him...

5
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:25,295
you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,890
It's Friday anyway, and hot.

7
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:32,808
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,322
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

9
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:39,214
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:42,818
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

11
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:45,187
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:48,057
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,059
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

14
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:51,894
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:55,931
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,667
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,739
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.

18
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:05,353
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:09,111
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:12,014
You come down here on business trips,

21
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:14,323
and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:17,553
I wish you wouldn't even come.

23
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,190
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,579
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:28,912
- I can come down next week.
- No.

26
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:34,038
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

27
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:38,255
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

28
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:40,342
But respectably.

29
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:43,245
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

30
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:47,082
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

31
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:49,391
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

32
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:51,507
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

33
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:53,623
Sam!

34
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,908
All right.

35
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:06,637
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

36
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:11,206
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

37
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:14,710
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

38
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,989
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

39
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:24,286
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

40
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:29,360
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

41
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,263
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

42
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:37,232
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:40,235
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

44
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,066
on the other side of the world.

45
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,041
I pay too.

46
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,128
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,416
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

48
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,691
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

49
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:01,290
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,441
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,102
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:15,804
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:19,374
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:22,332
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:34,857
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

56
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:37,246
I'm thinking of it.

57
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:43,866
How could you even
think a thing like that?

58
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:46,735
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

59
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:50,614
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

60
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:05,954
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

61
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:08,924
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

62
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:12,360
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

63
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:15,364
Lt'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

64
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:18,033
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

65
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:21,036
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

66
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:23,972
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

67
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:27,009
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

68
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:29,145
Any calls?

69
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:33,523
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

70
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:36,946
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

71
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:39,260
and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

72
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:47,062
Wow. It's as hot as fresh milk.

73
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:51,867
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

74
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,937
He can afford it today.

75
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:57,039
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

76
00:07:57,105 --> 00:08:01,076
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.

77
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:04,446
Oh... Oh, not you.
My daughter.

78
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:06,949
A baby.

79
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,920
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

80
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,040
I want you to take a look at my baby.

81
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,295
Eighteen years old...

82
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:25,100
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

83
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,217
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

84
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,939
Do you know what I do about unhappiness?

85
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,442
I buy it off.

86
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:35,978
Are, uh... Are you unhappy?

87
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:38,970
Uh, not inordinately.

88
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:45,507
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

89
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,353
Forty thousand dollars cash.

90
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:52,259
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

91
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:55,831
That's just buying off unhappiness.

93
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:01,103
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

94
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,412
- Count them!
- I declare!

95
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:07,142
I don't. That's how I get to keep it.

96
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:11,294
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

97
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:14,149
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

98
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,380
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe,

99
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:20,989
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

100
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:26,017
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

101
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:30,132
Uh-oh.

102
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:34,728
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

104
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:43,192
Lowery, I am dying of "thirst-aroonie."

105
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,517
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

106
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:53,488
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a check on Monday.

107
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:56,241
Yes.

108
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:04,579
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

109
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:19,904
Come in.

110
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:25,587
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

111
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:28,123
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

112
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:31,093
Because me and your boss are going out
and get ourselves...

113
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,095
a little drinking done, right?

114
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,998
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

115
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:40,535
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

116
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,003
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

117
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:50,178
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

118
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:53,568
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.

119
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:58,610
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

121
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:04,146
Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?

122
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,848
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

123
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:10,966
What is it, Marion?

125
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:50,106
Uh, hold it there.

127
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:57,657
In quite a hurry.

128
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:03,298
I didn't intend to sleep so long.
I almost had an accident from sleepiness.

129
00:15:03,298 --> 00:15:06,901
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

130
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:10,872
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

131
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:14,476
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

132
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,671
I mean, just to be safe.

133
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:19,681
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

134
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,672
Have I broken any laws?

135
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,980
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

136
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:28,356
Is anything wrong?

137
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:31,960
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

138
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,954
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

139
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,871
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

140
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:45,013
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

141
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,117
and you're taking up my time.

142
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,977
Now, just a moment.

143
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:52,681
Turn your motor off, please.

144
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:55,753
May I see your license?

145
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:01,470
- Why?
- Please.

147
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:09,592
Be with you in a second!

148
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:15,083
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

149
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,155
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

150
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,221
But I'm in no mood for it,

151
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,824
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

152
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:26,561
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

153
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:29,564
Being a woman, you will.
That yours?

154
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes, it's, it's...
There's nothing wrong with it. I just...

155
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,202
Sick of the sight of it.

156
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:37,906
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes,

157
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:40,136
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

158
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:42,176
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

159
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,045
and just wanna make a change.

160
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:45,914
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buying used cars...

161
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,269
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

162
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:52,567
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

164
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:15,510
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

165
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,111
- How much?
- Go ahead.

166
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:18,913
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

167
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,915
How much would it be with my car?

168
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:24,112
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

169
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:28,656
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing ya?

170
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:30,658
Of course not. Please.

171
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:36,664
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

172
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:41,135
Ah, I figure roughly...

173
00:20:41,135 --> 00:20:44,127
your car plus $700.

174
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:48,776
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

175
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,812
All right.

176
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,919
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

177
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,116
I mean, out-of-state license.
You got your pink slip...

178
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:04,352
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

179
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,392
In the building.

180
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:19,969
Over there.

182
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:19,000
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

183
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,836
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

184
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,839
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

185
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,117
I might as well be perfectly honest with you.
It's not that I don't trust you...

186
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:32,747
But what?
Is there anything so terribly wrong...

187
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:35,249
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

188
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,753
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

189
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:42,268
All right, let's go inside.

191
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:20,508
Hey!

192
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:30,071
Just put it in here, please.

193
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:34,356
Thank you.

194
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:44,952
Heck, Officer, that was the first time...

195
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:47,822
I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.

196
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:49,824
Somebody chasing her?

197
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:52,827
I better have a look at those papers, Charlie.

198
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:57,025
- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.

199
00:23:57,064 --> 00:24:01,216
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

200
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:11,452
Yes, Mr. Lowery.

201
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:13,981
Caroline. Marion still isn't in?

202
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:17,752
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

203
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:21,222
Buzz me the minute she comes in.

204
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:24,532
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

205
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:29,063
I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...

206
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,966
and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.

207
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:35,803
You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.

208
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:39,113
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

209
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,213
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

210
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:48,205
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

211
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:51,986
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

212
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:54,659
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

213
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:58,125
I did see her some time later driving...

214
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:02,198
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

215
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:05,414
Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

216
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:11,420
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

217
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:14,008
I'm not taking the responsibility.

218
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:18,479
Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.

219
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:20,595
All right, yes, you better come over.

220
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,120
Well, I ain't about to kiss off $40,000!

221
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,190
I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missing, I'll replace it...

222
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:30,258
with her fine, soft flesh!

223
00:25:30,258 --> 00:25:33,294
- We'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

224
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:38,493
I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. I, I can't...

225
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:41,969
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

226
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:46,121
You still trusting? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

227
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,089
Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And, and even flirting with me!

230
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:21,155
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

231
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,569
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

232
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:32,801
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

233
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:36,343
They, uh... They moved away the highway.

234
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:40,281
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.

235
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:45,480
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here anymore unless they've done that.

236
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:49,457
But... there's no sense dwelling on our losses.

237
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:53,689
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

238
00:28:57,198 --> 00:29:01,316
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

239
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:06,843
Los Angeles.

240
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,685
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

241
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:20,588
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

242
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:24,158
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

243
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:28,868
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

245
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:50,295
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

246
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:58,559
Well, the, uh, mattress is soft and...

247
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,789
there's hangers in the closet
and stationary...

248
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,830
with "Bates Motel" printed on it...

249
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,667
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

250
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,658
And the, uh...

251
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:12,773
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

252
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:15,276
Yeah.

253
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:19,588
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just... just tap on the wall.

254
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,615
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.

255
00:30:21,615 --> 00:30:24,288
Norman Bates.

256
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:30,191
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

257
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,593
- No.
- Then would you do me a favor?

258
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:34,428
Would you have dinner with me?

259
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:38,899
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special... just sandwiches and milk.

260
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,736
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

261
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:46,331
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

262
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:49,877
- I'd like to.
- All right.

263
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:52,713
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

264
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:56,350
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

265
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,945
With my... With my trusty umbrella.

266
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,772
No! I tell you no!

267
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:25,873
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

268
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:29,877
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

269
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:33,647
- of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
- Mother, please.

270
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:37,003
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

271
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:40,327
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

272
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:45,792
"Mother, she's just a stranger." As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

273
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:50,531
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

274
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:52,726
Do you understand, boy? Go on.

275
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:55,803
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

276
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:58,672
with my food or my son!

277
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:01,709
Or do I have to tell her
because you don't have the guts?

278
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:06,419
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

280
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:51,625
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

281
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,628
Mother... My mother, uh...

282
00:33:54,628 --> 00:33:57,431
What is the phrase?

283
00:33:57,431 --> 00:34:00,628
She isn't quite herself today.

284
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:05,900
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

285
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:08,817
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:14,114
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

287
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:16,116
Don't worry about it.

288
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:20,234
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

289
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:34,567
It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

290
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:50,150
Well, it stopped raining.

291
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,302
Uh, eating in an office
is just... just too officious.

292
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:57,312
- I have the parlor back here.
- All right.

293
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:15,748
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

294
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:21,882
You're very kind.

295
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:25,875
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

296
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,505
You... You eat like a bird.

297
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:37,920
And you'd know, of course.

298
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:39,967
No, not really.

299
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:43,570
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

300
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,075
is really a fal... false... falsity.

301
00:35:48,075 --> 00:35:51,954
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

302
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:58,719
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

303
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,754
You know, taxidermy.

304
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:05,305
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

305
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:07,814
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

306
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:09,819
You know, foxes and chimps.

307
00:36:09,897 --> 00:36:14,015
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

308
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:17,638
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

309
00:36:17,638 --> 00:36:21,313
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

310
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:24,211
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

311
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:27,915
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

312
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:31,785
And it's... it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

313
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:34,621
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

314
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,055
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

315
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:40,049
A man should have a hobby.

316
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:44,211
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

317
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:49,523
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

318
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,539
Is your time so empty?

319
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:55,142
No. Uh...

320
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:57,292
Well, I run the office...

321
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:59,813
and tend the cabins and grounds...

322
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:02,783
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

323
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:05,652
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

324
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:08,769
Do you go out with friends?

325
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:13,841
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

326
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:20,705
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

327
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:27,399
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

328
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,977
I didn't mean to pry.

329
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:32,935
I'm looking for a private island.

330
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:37,918
What are you running away from?

331
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:43,690
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

332
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,124
People never run away from anything.

333
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:52,933
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

334
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:55,731
I think that...

335
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,659
we're all in
our private traps,

336
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:05,034
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

337
00:38:06,713 --> 00:38:08,908
We scratch and... and claw,

338
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:12,953
but only at the air,
only at each other.

339
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:17,924
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

340
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:20,392
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

341
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:26,066
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it anymore.

342
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:29,422
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

343
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:32,071
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

344
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:39,206
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

345
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:43,050
the way she spoke to you...

346
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,043
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that,

347
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,692
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

348
00:38:51,692 --> 00:38:54,126
Or at least defy her.

349
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:02,871
But I know I can't. She's ill.

350
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:07,009
She sounded strong.

351
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:09,827
No, I mean... ill.

352
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:15,048
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

353
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,852
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

354
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:22,789
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

355
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:27,427
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

356
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:30,964
And he... he talked her
into building this motel.

357
00:39:30,964 --> 00:39:34,001
He could have talked her into anything.

358
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:38,140
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

359
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,630
And the way he died...

360
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:48,081
I guess it's nothing
to talk about while you're eating.

361
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:52,819
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

362
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:55,188
Except you.

363
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:58,464
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

364
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,096
Why don't you go away?

365
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,326
To a private island, like you?

366
00:40:08,668 --> 00:40:12,272
No... not like me.

367
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:16,424
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

368
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:19,468
She'd be alone up there.

369
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:23,750
The fire would go out.

370
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,584
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.

371
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:32,044
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

372
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:38,172
You understand,
I... I don't hate her.

373
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:42,271
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

374
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:49,658
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her... some place?

375
00:40:53,814 --> 00:40:57,170
You mean an institution? A madhouse?

376
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:04,380
People always call
a madhouse "some place," don't they?

377
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:06,573
Put her in "some place."

378
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:11,198
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

379
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:13,767
What do you know about caring?

380
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:16,964
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

381
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:20,841
The laughing and the tears...

382
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:23,196
and the cruel eyes studying you.

383
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,360
My mother there?

384
00:41:27,214 --> 00:41:30,206
But she's harmless.

385
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:35,002
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

386
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:38,706
I am sorry.

387
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:42,910
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

388
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:48,470
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

389
00:41:48,535 --> 00:41:52,272
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

390
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:54,342
oh, so very delicately...

391
00:42:01,014 --> 00:42:05,212
Of course, I've suggested it myself.

392
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:09,643
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

393
00:42:14,294 --> 00:42:19,099
It... It's not as if she were
a... a maniac, a raving thing.

394
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:21,659
She...

395
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:24,873
She just goes a little mad sometimes.

396
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:30,249
We all go a little mad sometimes.

397
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:34,422
Haven't you?

398
00:42:36,316 --> 00:42:38,466
Yes.

399
00:42:38,518 --> 00:42:43,956
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

400
00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:47,093
Thank you, "Norman."

401
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:49,963
Norman.

402
00:42:49,963 --> 00:42:53,399
Oh, you're not... you're not
going back to your room already?

403
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,269
I'm very tired.

404
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:59,306
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

405
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,274
Really?

406
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:04,630
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

407
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:09,354
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

408
00:43:10,984 --> 00:43:13,386
before it's too late for me too.

409
00:43:13,386 --> 00:43:16,990
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

410
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,593
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

411
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:23,196
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

412
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:25,198
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

413
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:28,235
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

414
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,531
All right, Miss, uh...

415
00:43:30,537 --> 00:43:32,528
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

416
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:34,994
Good night.

426
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:45,291
Ow! No!

427
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,680
No! Aaah!

432
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:52,318
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

433
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,867
Blood! Blood!

1
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:24,007
I've tried many brands.01:00:21,405

2
01:00:24,007 --> 01:00:27,711
So far, of those I've used,
I haven't had much luck with any of them.

3
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:30,714
Let's see what they say about this one.

4
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:33,283
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

5
01:00:33,283 --> 01:00:37,287
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

6
01:00:37,287 --> 01:00:40,257
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

7
01:00:40,257 --> 01:00:44,161
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

8
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:48,313
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

9
01:00:59,476 --> 01:01:01,831
Sam?

10
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:05,015
Sam! Lady wants to see ya.

11
01:01:10,787 --> 01:01:13,490
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

12
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:16,402
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

13
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:20,630
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
- Thank you.

15
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:26,571
She left home on Friday.

16
01:01:26,636 --> 01:01:30,273
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

17
01:01:30,273 --> 01:01:32,741
Not even a phone call.

18
01:01:32,742 --> 01:01:36,346
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business,

19
01:01:36,346 --> 01:01:39,463
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

20
01:01:39,516 --> 01:01:43,186
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

21
01:01:43,186 --> 01:01:46,223
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

22
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:55,167
Now, what thing could we be in together?

23
01:01:55,232 --> 01:01:57,348
Sorry about the tears.

24
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,670
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

25
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,821
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?

26
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,312
Who are you, friend?

27
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:11,542
My name is Arbogast, friend.

28
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:14,518
I'm a private investigator.

29
01:02:14,518 --> 01:02:18,255
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

30
01:02:18,255 --> 01:02:22,294
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

31
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:24,761
What's your interest in this?

32
01:02:24,761 --> 01:02:27,878
Well, $40,000.

33
01:02:29,332 --> 01:02:31,448
- $40,000?
- That's right.

34
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:38,542
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

35
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:40,544
Now, take it easy, friend.

36
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:44,414
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

37
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:46,803
What are you talking about?
What is this?

38
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:51,454
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

39
01:02:51,454 --> 01:02:54,651
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

40
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:57,360
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.

41
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,716
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

42
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:03,733
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

43
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:07,604
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

44
01:03:07,604 --> 01:03:10,574
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

45
01:03:10,574 --> 01:03:14,444
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

46
01:03:14,444 --> 01:03:17,447
I don't care if you believe me or not.

47
01:03:17,447 --> 01:03:20,564
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

48
01:03:20,584 --> 01:03:23,576
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

49
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:28,740
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car... by her employer, I might add.

50
01:03:28,792 --> 01:03:31,545
I can't believe it. Can you?

51
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,465
We're always quickest to doubt people...

52
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:37,979
who have a reputation for being honest.

53
01:03:38,134 --> 01:03:40,364
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

54
01:03:40,403 --> 01:03:42,806
Where there's a boyfriend...

55
01:03:42,806 --> 01:03:47,811
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

56
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:50,962
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

59
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:29,586
- Evening.
- Evening.

60
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:31,588
I almost drove right past.

61
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:34,858
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

62
01:04:34,858 --> 01:04:37,827
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

63
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:39,829
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

64
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:43,833
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

65
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:47,404
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

66
01:04:47,404 --> 01:04:50,407
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

67
01:04:50,407 --> 01:04:53,410
- Just doesn't seem like any use anymore.
- Oh?

68
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:56,846
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

69
01:04:56,846 --> 01:04:59,849
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

70
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:02,852
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

71
01:05:02,852 --> 01:05:05,855
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

72
01:05:05,855 --> 01:05:10,610
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such
a, I don't know... creepy smell.

73
01:05:11,728 --> 01:05:13,719
You out to buy a motel?

74
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:17,334
No.

75
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,969
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days,

76
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:21,871
I thought maybe...

77
01:05:21,871 --> 01:05:24,874
What, uh... What was it
you wanted to ask?

78
01:05:24,874 --> 01:05:27,577
I'm looking for a missing person.

79
01:05:27,577 --> 01:05:30,580
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

80
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,014
I've been trying to trace a girl...

81
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:36,586
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

82
01:05:36,586 --> 01:05:39,556
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

83
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:41,558
She's not in any trouble.

84
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:44,561
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

85
01:05:44,561 --> 01:05:46,597
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

86
01:05:46,663 --> 01:05:51,334
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

87
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:54,337
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

88
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:56,339
Mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

89
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:57,807
Commit myself?

90
01:05:57,807 --> 01:06:01,117
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

91
01:06:02,746 --> 01:06:04,816
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

92
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:07,884
Well, she may have used an alias.

93
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:09,886
Marion Crane's her real name,

94
01:06:09,886 --> 01:06:13,456
but she could've registered
under a different one.

95
01:06:13,456 --> 01:06:17,608
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering anymore.

96
01:06:17,627 --> 01:06:20,630
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

97
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:24,667
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

98
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:26,469
Which reminds me...

99
01:06:26,469 --> 01:06:27,538
Which reminds me...

100
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:30,440
- What's that?
- The sign.

101
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,750
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on,

102
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:36,780
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

103
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,930
You see, that's exactly my point.

104
01:06:38,948 --> 01:06:41,551
Nobody'd been here for a couple weeks,

105
01:06:41,551 --> 01:06:45,555
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

106
01:06:45,555 --> 01:06:47,625
As you say, old habits die hard.

107
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:51,594
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

108
01:06:51,594 --> 01:06:53,824
- No.
- Thank you.

109
01:06:55,532 --> 01:06:57,867
All right.

110
01:06:57,867 --> 01:07:01,738
I'll get the date somewhere. Mm-hmm.

111
01:07:01,738 --> 01:07:04,206
See, there's nobody.

112
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:07,810
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

113
01:07:09,012 --> 01:07:11,014
Oh, yes.

114
01:07:11,014 --> 01:07:13,016
Here we are.

115
01:07:13,016 --> 01:07:15,018
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

116
01:07:15,018 --> 01:07:17,020
That's an interesting alias.

117
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,622
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

118
01:07:19,622 --> 01:07:21,624
Marie, Marion.

119
01:07:21,624 --> 01:07:24,775
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

120
01:07:24,828 --> 01:07:29,699
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

121
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:33,470
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

122
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,473
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

123
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:38,408
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

124
01:07:38,408 --> 01:07:39,727
I know.

125
01:07:39,742 --> 01:07:41,812
Oh, yeah.

126
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:47,044
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

127
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:49,052
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

128
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:50,854
No, I guess not.

129
01:07:50,854 --> 01:07:52,856
Tell me all about her.

130
01:07:52,856 --> 01:07:54,926
Well, um,

131
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:59,109
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

132
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,865
and, uh, left early the next morning.

133
01:08:01,865 --> 01:08:04,982
- How early?
- Oh, ex... very early.

134
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:08,438
Mm-hmm. Which morning was that?

135
01:08:08,438 --> 01:08:10,349
Uh, the, um...

136
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,716
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

137
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:16,018
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

138
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:18,047
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

139
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,884
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

140
01:08:20,884 --> 01:08:23,753
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

141
01:08:23,753 --> 01:08:25,755
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

142
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:29,759
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

143
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,035
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

144
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,234
Uh, w-w...

145
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:39,736
Well, she was very tired a-and, uh...

146
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:42,605
See, I... N-Now I'm staring
to, um... remember.

147
01:08:42,605 --> 01:08:45,073
I-I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

148
01:08:45,074 --> 01:08:48,111
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

149
01:08:48,177 --> 01:08:51,567
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

150
01:08:51,581 --> 01:08:54,584
N-No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

151
01:08:54,584 --> 01:08:57,587
She said she had to go to sleep early...

152
01:08:57,587 --> 01:09:01,705
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

153
01:09:01,758 --> 01:09:04,594
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

154
01:09:04,594 --> 01:09:07,230
No, you said before she
was standing back there...

155
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,232
Yes, b-back in my parlor.

156
01:09:09,232 --> 01:09:12,235
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

157
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:17,240
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

158
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,242
I see. How did she pay you?

159
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:21,110
- Cash? Check?
- Cash.

160
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,112
Cash, huh? Mm-hmm.

161
01:09:23,112 --> 01:09:27,717
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

162
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:29,753
Hmm.

164
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:35,825
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

165
01:09:35,825 --> 01:09:39,374
I-I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

166
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:42,441
To tell you the truth, I do mind.

167
01:09:42,532 --> 01:09:45,922
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

168
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:48,938
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

169
01:09:48,938 --> 01:09:52,374
Well, I-I-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

170
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:54,544
People just come and go, you know.

171
01:09:54,544 --> 01:09:56,978
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

172
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,848
No.

173
01:09:58,848 --> 01:10:04,587
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

174
01:10:04,587 --> 01:10:08,023
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

175
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:10,174
Oh.  No, thanks.

176
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,126
Uh, change your mind?

177
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,682
Oh.

178
01:10:32,682 --> 01:10:36,470
You know, I... I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

179
01:10:36,586 --> 01:10:38,463
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

180
01:10:38,554 --> 01:10:41,090
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

181
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:43,160
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

182
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:45,217
Oh, th-that must be my mother.

183
01:10:45,294 --> 01:10:47,897
She's an, uh, "inavlid..." an invalid.

184
01:10:47,897 --> 01:10:50,331
Uh, it's practically like living alone.

185
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,608
Oh, I see.

186
01:10:52,635 --> 01:10:57,306
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

187
01:10:57,306 --> 01:10:59,876
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

188
01:10:59,876 --> 01:11:01,912
No.

189
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:06,849
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

190
01:11:06,849 --> 01:11:08,885
You'd know you were being used.

191
01:11:08,951 --> 01:11:11,943
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

192
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:14,724
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

193
01:11:14,724 --> 01:11:17,727
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

194
01:11:17,727 --> 01:11:21,117
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

195
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,133
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

196
01:11:24,133 --> 01:11:26,203
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

197
01:11:26,269 --> 01:11:30,106
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

198
01:11:30,106 --> 01:11:33,257
Sick old women are usually pretty sharp.

199
01:11:33,309 --> 01:11:35,311
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr. Arbogast, I-I think I've...

200
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:38,915
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

201
01:11:38,915 --> 01:11:41,918
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

202
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:43,954
Well, all right.

203
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,957
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

204
01:11:47,957 --> 01:11:51,074
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

205
01:11:51,127 --> 01:11:53,277
All right. Thanks, anyway.

209
01:12:47,383 --> 01:12:50,987
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

210
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:53,376
Let me talk to her,
please.

211
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,861
Hello, Lila.

212
01:12:56,926 --> 01:13:00,763
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.

213
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:03,766
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

214
01:13:03,766 --> 01:13:05,768
It's out on the old highway.

215
01:13:05,768 --> 01:13:09,238
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

216
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:13,550
Well, this young fella that runs
the place said she just spent the night,

217
01:13:13,709 --> 01:13:16,379
left the next day and that was it.

218
01:13:16,379 --> 01:13:19,974
Mmm. Um, no, not exactly.

219
01:13:21,517 --> 01:13:23,667
Well, I did question him, believe me,

220
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:26,631
but I think I got
all there was to get.

221
01:13:26,722 --> 01:13:29,525
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

222
01:13:29,525 --> 01:13:33,129
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

223
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:36,132
See, this boy had a sick old mother.

224
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:39,068
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

225
01:13:39,068 --> 01:13:42,405
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

226
01:13:42,405 --> 01:13:47,076
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

227
01:13:47,076 --> 01:13:50,913
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

228
01:13:50,913 --> 01:13:52,915
All right, fine. Listen, I...

229
01:13:52,915 --> 01:13:55,918
You'll be happy to know what I think.

230
01:13:55,918 --> 01:14:00,070
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

231
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:04,293
All right. See ya
in about an hour... or less.

232
01:14:04,293 --> 01:14:06,443
All right, bye-bye.

233
01:15:01,951 --> 01:15:04,067
Bates?

235
01:17:37,106 --> 01:17:41,258
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

236
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:46,215
Sam, he said an hour or less.

237
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:48,445
Yeah.

238
01:17:48,484 --> 01:17:50,453
It's been three.

239
01:17:50,453 --> 01:17:52,603
Are we just going to sit here and wait?

240
01:17:52,621 --> 01:17:54,771
He'll be back.

241
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:57,458
Let's sit still and hang on, okay?

243
01:18:02,298 --> 01:18:05,734
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

244
01:18:05,734 --> 01:18:08,337
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

245
01:18:08,337 --> 01:18:10,612
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

246
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:13,642
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

247
01:18:13,642 --> 01:18:15,644
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

248
01:18:15,644 --> 01:18:17,760
An hour, or less.

249
01:18:21,283 --> 01:18:23,285
Well, I'm going.

250
01:18:23,285 --> 01:18:25,401
You'll never find it.

251
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:30,824
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

252
01:18:30,826 --> 01:18:34,830
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

253
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:37,399
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

254
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:39,196
Yeah. Stay here.

257
01:18:59,288 --> 01:19:01,404
Arbogast?

258
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:04,407
Arbogast!

259
01:19:07,096 --> 01:19:09,007
Arbogast!

265
01:19:38,294 --> 01:19:40,863
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

266
01:19:40,863 --> 01:19:44,366
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

267
01:19:44,366 --> 01:19:47,597
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door... or unwilling.

268
01:19:47,636 --> 01:19:49,638
Where could he have gone?

269
01:19:49,638 --> 01:19:51,640
Maybe he got some definite lead.

270
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,642
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

271
01:19:53,642 --> 01:19:55,644
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

272
01:19:55,644 --> 01:19:57,646
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

273
01:19:57,646 --> 01:20:01,650
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

274
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:03,652
Yes, I think he would've.

275
01:20:03,652 --> 01:20:05,847
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

276
01:20:05,888 --> 01:20:09,517
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

277
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:19,602
Good evening.

278
01:20:19,602 --> 01:20:23,720
Well, I... I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

279
01:20:23,772 --> 01:20:25,774
Yes.

280
01:20:25,774 --> 01:20:28,777
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

281
01:20:28,777 --> 01:20:31,780
She's been here
searching for her sister.

282
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,782
There's this
private detective helping.

283
01:20:33,782 --> 01:20:36,352
We got a call from this
detective... he'd traced her...

284
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,502
to that motel on the old highway.

285
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:40,556
That must be the Bates Motel.

286
01:20:40,556 --> 01:20:43,593
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs. Bates.

287
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:45,661
Norman took a wife?

288
01:20:45,661 --> 01:20:49,265
No, I-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

289
01:20:49,265 --> 01:20:52,257
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

290
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:55,871
Now, your sister's missing how long?

291
01:20:55,871 --> 01:20:58,908
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

292
01:20:58,974 --> 01:21:02,745
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

293
01:21:02,745 --> 01:21:04,895
They thought she'd be coming to me.

294
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:07,516
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

295
01:21:07,516 --> 01:21:09,518
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

296
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:11,520
That's right.

297
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,670
From what?

298
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,293
She stole some money.

299
01:21:17,293 --> 01:21:19,328
A lot?

300
01:21:19,328 --> 01:21:21,319
Forty thousand dollars.

301
01:21:21,363 --> 01:21:23,399
The police haven't been able to...

302
01:21:23,465 --> 01:21:27,060
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

303
01:21:27,202 --> 01:21:30,005
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

304
01:21:30,005 --> 01:21:32,007
That explains the private detective.

305
01:21:32,007 --> 01:21:33,998
He traced her to the Bates place.

306
01:21:34,243 --> 01:21:37,246
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

307
01:21:37,246 --> 01:21:40,522
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

308
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:42,551
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

309
01:21:42,551 --> 01:21:44,985
about the money.

310
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:47,556
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

311
01:21:47,556 --> 01:21:51,427
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

312
01:21:51,427 --> 01:21:53,429
That's what I want you
to do something about.

313
01:21:53,429 --> 01:21:54,897
Like what?

314
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:57,466
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

315
01:21:57,466 --> 01:22:01,303
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

316
01:22:01,303 --> 01:22:05,007
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

317
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:08,010
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

318
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:12,288
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

319
01:22:12,314 --> 01:22:14,350
probably from Norman Bates,

320
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:17,626
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

321
01:22:17,653 --> 01:22:22,057
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

322
01:22:22,057 --> 01:22:24,207
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

323
01:22:24,259 --> 01:22:26,170
At this hour?

324
01:22:26,261 --> 01:22:30,866
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

325
01:22:30,866 --> 01:22:33,802
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answering
the door in the dead of night,

326
01:22:33,802 --> 01:22:35,804
like some people do.

327
01:22:35,804 --> 01:22:38,741
This fellow lives like a hermit.

328
01:22:38,741 --> 01:22:41,643
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

329
01:22:41,643 --> 01:22:43,759
Please. Call.

330
01:22:49,017 --> 01:22:53,374
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

331
01:22:59,428 --> 01:23:02,545
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

332
01:23:02,598 --> 01:23:05,601
Ye... I been just fine, thanks.

333
01:23:05,601 --> 01:23:08,195
Listen, we got worries here.

334
01:23:08,303 --> 01:23:11,739
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

335
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:15,477
Well, this one wouldn't be a customer.

336
01:23:15,477 --> 01:23:18,514
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

337
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,696
Arbogast.

338
01:23:22,918 --> 01:23:25,034
And after he left?

339
01:23:27,623 --> 01:23:29,773
No, that's... that's okay, Norman.

341
01:23:32,494 --> 01:23:35,497
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

342
01:23:35,497 --> 01:23:38,500
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

343
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,837
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

344
01:23:41,837 --> 01:23:44,840
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

345
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:48,477
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

346
01:23:48,477 --> 01:23:50,479
Yes.

347
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:53,277
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

348
01:23:53,382 --> 01:23:57,534
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

349
01:23:57,586 --> 01:24:01,156
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

350
01:24:01,156 --> 01:24:03,158
'T ain't only local history, Sam.

351
01:24:03,158 --> 01:24:07,129
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

352
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:10,999
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was... involved with...

353
01:24:10,999 --> 01:24:13,635
when she found out he was married,

354
01:24:13,635 --> 01:24:16,832
then took a helping of
the same stuff herself.

355
01:24:16,872 --> 01:24:20,609
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

356
01:24:20,609 --> 01:24:23,479
Norman found them dead together.

357
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:26,415
In bed.

358
01:24:26,415 --> 01:24:28,849
You mean that old woman I saw sitting
in the window wasn't Bates' mother?

359
01:24:28,851 --> 01:24:33,555
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

360
01:24:33,555 --> 01:24:35,910
Yes! In the house behind the motel!

361
01:24:35,924 --> 01:24:38,154
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

362
01:24:38,193 --> 01:24:40,829
You saw Norman Bates' mother?

363
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:44,566
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

364
01:24:44,566 --> 01:24:48,275
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

365
01:24:48,403 --> 01:24:52,207
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs. Bates,

366
01:24:52,207 --> 01:24:56,041
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

367
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:42,772
Now, Mother, um...
I-I'm gonna bring something up...

368
01:25:42,824 --> 01:25:45,561
I am sorry, boy,

369
01:25:45,561 --> 01:25:49,097
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

370
01:25:49,097 --> 01:25:51,099
Please, Mother.

371
01:25:51,099 --> 01:25:54,296
No! I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

372
01:25:54,469 --> 01:25:57,620
Ha! You think I'm fruity, huh?

373
01:25:57,673 --> 01:25:59,709
I'm staying right here.

374
01:25:59,775 --> 01:26:02,778
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it,

375
01:26:02,778 --> 01:26:05,280
least of all my big, bold son.

376
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,282
They'll come now, Mother.

377
01:26:07,282 --> 01:26:11,119
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

378
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:15,271
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

379
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,640
Just for a few days?

380
01:26:17,693 --> 01:26:21,597
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!

381
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:24,987
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

382
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,036
Now get out!

383
01:26:28,036 --> 01:26:31,907
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

384
01:26:31,907 --> 01:26:34,944
Norman, what do you think you're doing?

385
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:38,798
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!

386
01:26:43,785 --> 01:26:46,936
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

390
01:26:52,194 --> 01:26:54,196
Wonderful sermon today.

391
01:26:54,196 --> 01:26:56,832
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

392
01:26:58,732 --> 01:27:00,962
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

393
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:03,537
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

394
01:27:03,537 --> 01:27:06,072
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

395
01:27:06,072 --> 01:27:09,843
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.

396
01:27:09,843 --> 01:27:12,118
What did he say about my sister?

397
01:27:12,145 --> 01:27:15,582
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

398
01:27:15,582 --> 01:27:19,860
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

399
01:27:19,886 --> 01:27:22,889
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

400
01:27:22,889 --> 01:27:25,323
I know you're not
the seeing-illusions type,

401
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:28,370
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

402
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:30,372
I still feel there's something...

403
01:27:30,463 --> 01:27:33,967
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

404
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:38,572
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

405
01:27:38,572 --> 01:27:41,405
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

406
01:27:41,508 --> 01:27:45,011
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up.

407
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:47,081
How 'bout that?

408
01:27:47,147 --> 01:27:50,219
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

409
01:27:50,283 --> 01:27:54,640
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

410
01:27:54,654 --> 01:27:56,656
You too, Sam.

411
01:27:56,656 --> 01:27:59,659
Thank you.

412
01:27:59,659 --> 01:28:04,664
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

413
01:28:04,664 --> 01:28:07,861
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

414
01:28:07,901 --> 01:28:12,639
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

415
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,836
Neither will I. Come on.

416
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:19,948
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

417
01:28:20,013 --> 01:28:22,208
We're going to register as man and wife.

418
01:28:22,248 --> 01:28:25,638
We're going to get shown to a cabin,

419
01:28:25,652 --> 01:28:29,247
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

421
01:28:52,579 --> 01:28:55,491
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

422
01:28:55,582 --> 01:28:57,584
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

423
01:28:57,584 --> 01:28:58,699
Come on.

424
01:29:01,955 --> 01:29:04,357
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

425
01:29:04,357 --> 01:29:06,507
Uh-huh. Suppose you want a room.

426
01:29:06,559 --> 01:29:08,948
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco,

427
01:29:08,962 --> 01:29:11,364
but we don't like the look of that sky.

428
01:29:11,364 --> 01:29:14,515
Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?

429
01:29:21,207 --> 01:29:23,810
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

430
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:25,812
That's not necessary.

431
01:29:25,812 --> 01:29:29,487
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90% business.

432
01:29:29,616 --> 01:29:32,352
He wants practically notarized receipts.

433
01:29:32,352 --> 01:29:35,469
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.

434
01:29:53,173 --> 01:29:55,289
Thank you.

435
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:59,521
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

436
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:06,054
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

437
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:08,121
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

438
01:30:08,121 --> 01:30:12,273
- and you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

440
01:30:18,732 --> 01:30:21,041
That receipt.

441
01:30:25,905 --> 01:30:28,544
I'll go on ahead.

442
01:30:33,146 --> 01:30:36,182
All right, there's your receipt.
I'll show you the cabin.

443
01:30:36,182 --> 01:30:39,254
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

444
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:59,979
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

445
01:31:00,006 --> 01:31:02,976
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

446
01:31:02,976 --> 01:31:04,978
I know.

447
01:31:04,978 --> 01:31:07,013
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

448
01:31:07,013 --> 01:31:09,015
I don't know, but if you had...

449
01:31:09,015 --> 01:31:12,451
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

450
01:31:12,452 --> 01:31:16,001
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

451
01:31:18,758 --> 01:31:20,828
How could we prove that...

452
01:31:20,894 --> 01:31:23,797
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

453
01:31:23,797 --> 01:31:26,027
There must be some proof that exists now,

454
01:31:26,065 --> 01:31:29,262
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

455
01:31:29,302 --> 01:31:34,296
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

456
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:36,376
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

457
01:31:36,376 --> 01:31:38,044
the same way about you.

458
01:31:38,044 --> 01:31:40,914
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

459
01:31:40,914 --> 01:31:43,348
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us,

460
01:31:43,349 --> 01:31:44,918
unless he was stopped.

461
01:31:44,918 --> 01:31:48,957
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

462
01:31:51,024 --> 01:31:53,902
We'll start with cabin one.

463
01:31:55,461 --> 01:31:58,771
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

464
01:32:30,563 --> 01:32:32,679
Bates.

465
01:33:21,247 --> 01:33:23,283
No shower curtain.

466
01:33:23,283 --> 01:33:25,952
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

467
01:33:25,952 --> 01:33:28,102
It's figuring.
It didn't get washed down. Look.

468
01:33:28,154 --> 01:33:32,125
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

469
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:34,593
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

470
01:33:34,594 --> 01:33:36,596
Bates never denied she was here.

471
01:33:36,596 --> 01:33:39,952
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

472
01:33:39,966 --> 01:33:42,535
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

473
01:33:42,535 --> 01:33:46,072
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

474
01:33:46,072 --> 01:33:49,382
I want her to tell us the same thing.

475
01:33:49,409 --> 01:33:51,639
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

476
01:33:51,644 --> 01:33:53,646
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

477
01:33:53,646 --> 01:33:57,016
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

478
01:33:57,016 --> 01:34:00,353
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

479
01:34:00,353 --> 01:34:03,323
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

480
01:34:03,323 --> 01:34:05,325
I can handle a sick old woman.

481
01:34:05,325 --> 01:34:08,476
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

482
01:34:09,329 --> 01:34:11,364
Wait a minute.

483
01:34:11,364 --> 01:34:14,640
If you get anything out of the mother,

484
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:17,036
can you find your way back to town?

485
01:34:17,036 --> 01:34:19,372
Yes, of course.

486
01:34:19,372 --> 01:34:22,728
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

487
01:34:46,731 --> 01:34:49,467
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

488
01:34:49,467 --> 01:34:51,617
Wife's taking a nap and...

489
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:55,707
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

490
01:34:55,707 --> 01:34:59,222
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

491
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,287
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

492
01:36:15,287 --> 01:36:17,689
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

493
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,044
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

494
01:36:20,225 --> 01:36:22,375
Here you are doing all the listening.

495
01:36:22,427 --> 01:36:24,863
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

496
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:27,599
Drive me crazy.

497
01:36:27,599 --> 01:36:30,602
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

498
01:36:30,602 --> 01:36:35,722
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

499
01:36:35,774 --> 01:36:37,924
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

500
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:45,011
Mrs. Bates?

503
01:38:01,826 --> 01:38:04,529
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here,

504
01:38:04,529 --> 01:38:06,531
I'm just doubting that you are.

505
01:38:06,531 --> 01:38:10,101
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

506
01:38:10,101 --> 01:38:14,105
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

507
01:38:14,105 --> 01:38:17,108
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

508
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:19,906
My mother and I were more than happy.

509
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:24,042
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

510
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:26,044
I don't know what you've been saying.

511
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:29,161
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

512
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,530
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

513
01:39:31,583 --> 01:39:34,452
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

514
01:39:34,452 --> 01:39:37,330
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

515
01:39:37,422 --> 01:39:41,335
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

516
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:44,668
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

517
01:39:47,999 --> 01:39:51,603
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

518
01:39:51,603 --> 01:39:55,312
I think she'll tell us.

519
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,069
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

520
01:41:03,841 --> 01:41:06,150
Mrs. Bates, it's...

523
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:29,782
Norman Bates!

525
01:41:57,996 --> 01:42:01,799
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

526
01:42:01,799 --> 01:42:04,602
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

527
01:42:04,602 --> 01:42:06,638
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

528
01:42:07,839 --> 01:42:10,608
Did he talk to you?

529
01:42:10,608 --> 01:42:13,486
No.

530
01:42:13,578 --> 01:42:18,652
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother."

531
01:42:19,851 --> 01:42:23,400
Norman Bates no longer exists.

532
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:26,224
He only half-existed to begin with.

533
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:30,342
And now the other half has taken over,

534
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,075
probably for all time.

535
01:42:34,799 --> 01:42:36,790
Did he kill my sister?

536
01:42:36,868 --> 01:42:40,338
Yes... and no.

537
01:42:40,338 --> 01:42:43,141
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

538
01:42:43,141 --> 01:42:45,910
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

539
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:49,027
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.

540
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,649
He merely tries to explain it.

541
01:42:51,649 --> 01:42:54,641
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

542
01:42:56,921 --> 01:43:01,726
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

543
01:43:01,726 --> 01:43:05,514
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

544
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:12,336
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

545
01:43:12,336 --> 01:43:15,726
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

546
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,732
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said,

547
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:20,960
the "mother."

548
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:26,606
To understand it the way I understood it,
hearing it from the "mother"...

549
01:43:26,684 --> 01:43:30,221
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

550
01:43:30,221 --> 01:43:33,257
you have to go back ten years...

551
01:43:33,257 --> 01:43:35,927
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

552
01:43:35,927 --> 01:43:41,001
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

553
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:47,271
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman,

554
01:43:47,271 --> 01:43:51,389
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

555
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:55,278
Then she met a man,

556
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:59,884
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

557
01:43:59,884 --> 01:44:03,287
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

558
01:44:03,287 --> 01:44:07,439
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

559
01:44:09,293 --> 01:44:13,264
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

560
01:44:13,264 --> 01:44:18,816
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

561
01:44:21,072 --> 01:44:23,540
He stole her corpse.

562
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:28,460
A weighted coffin was buried.

563
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:31,482
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

564
01:44:31,482 --> 01:44:34,758
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

565
01:44:34,786 --> 01:44:37,488
And that still wasn't enough.

566
01:44:37,488 --> 01:44:41,447
She was there... but she was a corpse.

567
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:46,614
So he began to think and speak for her,

568
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:49,803
give her half his life, so to speak.

569
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:54,438
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

570
01:44:54,438 --> 01:44:58,943
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

571
01:44:58,943 --> 01:45:03,539
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother,"

572
01:45:05,183 --> 01:45:08,920
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her,

573
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,593
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

574
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:17,001
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

575
01:45:17,028 --> 01:45:20,941
the "mother" side of him would go wild.

576
01:45:23,034 --> 01:45:26,026
When he met your sister,

577
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,840
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

578
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,542
He wanted her.

579
01:45:31,542 --> 01:45:35,581
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

580
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:42,427
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

581
01:45:42,453 --> 01:45:46,290
and, like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime...

582
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:48,860
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

583
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:51,295
Why was he... dressed like that?

584
01:45:51,295 --> 01:45:54,232
He's a transvestite.

585
01:45:54,232 --> 01:45:57,068
Uh, not exactly.

586
01:45:57,068 --> 01:46:00,617
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change,

587
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,921
or satisfaction, is a transvestite.

588
01:46:02,974 --> 01:46:07,278
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

589
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:10,475
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

590
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:15,021
And when reality came to close,

591
01:46:15,086 --> 01:46:18,635
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

592
01:46:21,058 --> 01:46:24,095
he dressed up,
even to a cheap wig he bought.

593
01:46:24,161 --> 01:46:28,199
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

594
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:30,429
He tried to be his mother.

595
01:46:32,003 --> 01:46:35,154
And, uh, now he is.

596
01:46:35,206 --> 01:46:40,200
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother."

597
01:46:40,278 --> 01:46:44,282
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

598
01:46:44,282 --> 01:46:47,952
there's always a conflict, a battle.

599
01:46:47,952 --> 01:46:51,555
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

600
01:46:51,555 --> 01:46:53,864
and the dominant personality has won.

601
01:46:53,891 --> 01:46:58,009
And the $40,000? Who got that?

602
01:46:58,062 --> 01:47:02,021
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

603
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:06,379
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

604
01:47:07,505 --> 01:47:09,496
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

605
01:47:22,153 --> 01:47:24,542
Thank you.

606
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:34,231
It's sad when
a mother has to speak the words...

607
01:47:34,231 --> 01:47:36,500
that condemn her own son,

608
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:40,404
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

609
01:47:40,404 --> 01:47:44,976
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

610
01:47:44,976 --> 01:47:47,809
He was always bad, and in the end...

611
01:47:47,912 --> 01:47:52,349
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man,

612
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:56,187
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare,

613
01:47:56,187 --> 01:47:59,223
like one of his stuffed birds.

614
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:02,772
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

615
01:48:02,927 --> 01:48:08,524
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

616
01:48:11,469 --> 01:48:15,339
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

617
01:48:15,339 --> 01:48:19,243
Let them see what kind of a person I am.

618
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,518
I'm not even gonna swat that fly.

619
01:48:21,545 --> 01:48:25,116
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

620
01:48:25,116 --> 01:48:27,118
They'll see and they'll know,

621
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:32,795
and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."
