1
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:21,263
It's a story that might bore you, but you don't have to listen,

2
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:24,307
because I always knew it was going to be like that.

3
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,274
Woman: And it was, I think, in that last year, or weekend...

4
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,943
really a Friday in December at Camden...

5
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:37,445
and this was years ago, when I was a different person

6
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:40,866
and I was so drunk that I ended up losing my virginity.

7
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:49,082
I lost it to some guy who I thought was a Ceramics major,

8
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,334
but was actually either a NYU film student

9
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:53,837
who was just up to Camden for the "End of the World,"

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,464
or a townie.

11
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:01,636
I actually had my eye on someone else that night...Victor.

12
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,805
I'm telling you, with European girls,

13
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:05,307
it's just a numbers game.

14
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:09,019
If you stand in any major European city on any fucking corner,

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,480
and consecutively ask every girl that walks by if she'll fuck you,

16
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,357
one out of 20 will say "yes."

17
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:17,194
Woman: A junior, a Drama major, just back from Europe...

18
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:19,905
only a little gay, with flecked blond hair,

19
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:22,699
a great body and these amazing gray eyes.

20
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:25,660
Bam...20th one, you're fucking. Right there.

21
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:28,163
It's a confirmed statistic, my man.

22
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:31,875
Woman: But Victor was fucking my roommate, Lara.

23
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:35,670
She gave him mono before he dumped her.

24
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:39,216
I'm told that later, after I left Camden,

25
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:43,220
she got really drunk and went wandering through Windham House,

26
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:45,680
and did the whole football team.

27
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:49,184
Man: White girl...

28
00:01:56,525 --> 00:02:00,487
She's now married to a senator and has four kids.

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,781
How time distorts things.

30
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,158
So you know the movie I'm talking about?

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,079
It was wrongfully labeled "A Tarantino Film,"

32
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,665
even though he was just credited as executive producer.

33
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:14,084
So this guy from NYU, or whatever...

34
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,002
who wasn't even a good Victor facsimile...

35
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:19,589
and I were talking on this ratty old couch.

36
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,177
I'm sure you've seen this movie, this Russian classic,

37
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,221
- "The Man with the Camera"? - Yep, yep.

38
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:30,058
I kept agreeing with his likes and dislikes, all the time thinking

39
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,228
that while he might not be Victor, he was cute enough.

40
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,189
It's real. It's like real... shit.

41
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:39,651
I was sure that I was mispronouncing all these filmmakers' names,

42
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,112
remembering all the wrong actors,

43
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:44,990
naming the wrong cinematographers, but I wanted him.

44
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,952
...I see the same kind of "silent movie actress" quality.

45
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,872
Seriously, has anyone ever told you you look like Clara Bow?

46
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:54,875
Because you do, I'm serious. I'm telling you.

47
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,294
I know these things, and... and...

48
00:02:57,335 --> 00:03:02,924
Woman: I could see that his gaze was drifting towards Kristin Notneff.

49
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:06,261
And she was looking back at him with confidence, because she knew

50
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:09,598
that underneath her clothes she was wearing a black bra

51
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,851
with matching black lace panties, which I wasn't.

52
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:16,563
Um, I'm sorry, what was I talking about?

53
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,399
Woman: But I had the next best thing.

54
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:22,694
I've got a joint in my room.

55
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:28,950
Except it wasn't my room. It was Lorna Slavin's room,

56
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,119
who was off- campus at her boyfriend's house,

57
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:33,622
probably swallowing his DNA.

58
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,999
And I didn't have a joint either,

59
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,918
and if I did, I didn't know where it was,

60
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,630
because it would have been Lorna Slavin's joint.

61
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:44,216
He wouldn't have cared if I had one or not.

62
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:54,726
I must have passed out around then.

63
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,521
When I came to, he was already fucking me,

64
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:00,357
but he didn't know that I was a virgin and that it hurt.

65
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:03,109
Not that badly...only a little bit of sharp pain,

66
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:05,320
but not as bad as I had been taught to expect...

67
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:08,406
but not exactly pleasant, either.

68
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,661
That's when I heard another voice in the room.

69
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,163
Now, I want you to do her like Ron Jeremy would.

70
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,624
Woman: I remember the weight on the bed shifting,

71
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,126
and realizing that this person behind me

72
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:24,130
wasn't the NYU film student guy, but somebody else.

73
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:28,134
Oh, my God, it was some townie.

74
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,762
I had actually lost my virginity to a townie.

75
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,350
This wouldn't have happened with Victor.

76
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:39,813
He would have taken me gently in his big, strong Drama major arms,

77
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,858
and undressed me quietly and expertly,

78
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:46,778
taken my bra off with grace and ease.

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,531
And it probably wouldn't have hurt.

80
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:53,869
I should have given myself to Victor last term when I had the chance.

81
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,585
Dude, we had to put the keg somewhere.

82
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,712
Don't put it there, it's blocking my shot.

83
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,423
Now get the fuck out of here before you ruin my movie.

84
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,849
Woman: I always knew it would be like this.

85
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:58,941
I just get the feeling my life lacks forward momentum.

86
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,068
Like everything is moving by so quickly

87
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:04,112
that time just seems to stop.

88
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:09,492
Man's voice: Sometimes I can't believe the shit

89
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,451
that spills out of my mouth.

90
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,871
So while I talk about God knows what,

91
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:16,039
I let my eyes drift across the room,

92
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:19,459
as my mouth allows thoughts to drop out of my brain

93
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:22,045
and roll off my tongue like gumballs,

94
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:25,716
I imagine all the things in life that never were,

95
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:29,302
and all the things that could have been.

96
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,891
He'll do.

97
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,476
I like this song.

98
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,020
Man's voice: Gay song, definitely.

99
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,855
Do you have any E?

100
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:44,733
That shit makes your spinal fluid run backwards.

101
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:49,988
- I may have some up in my room - You're game, right?

102
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:53,699
No one's twisting your arm.

103
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:57,286
I don't even know why I'm trying to convince you.

104
00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:59,038
Let's do it.

105
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,167
I think it's kicking in.

106
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,587
I feel it now, too.

107
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,005
Man's voice: The truth is, I feel nothing.

108
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,111
What the fuck!

109
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:42,954
- Sorry, I thought you were gay - Fuck you, I'm no fag!

110
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,084
You sure about that?

111
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:52,254
I definitely detect a certain "faggy- ness" to you.

112
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:57,217
Get the fuck outta here, you fucking homo!

113
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:02,930
I'm not gay.

114
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:04,807
You're lucky I don't kill you.

115
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,646
Luck has nothing to do with it.

116
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:12,731
Everything is preordained.

117
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:14,525
Manifest destiny.

118
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,193
You can stop time from happening no more than you can will

119
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:19,279
the oceans to overwhelm the world,

120
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:22,115
or to cause the moon to drop from her outer sphere.

121
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,242
Three months later, the handsome dunce

122
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:25,660
had an affair with a friend of mine.

123
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,620
Within a year, he was a full- blown queen

124
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:29,746
and telling people I couldn't get it up.

125
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,709
Luck has nothing to do with anything.

126
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:12,551
Man's voice: A great numb feeling washes over me

127
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:15,512
as I let go of the past and look forward to the future.

128
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:18,640
I pretend to be a vampire.

129
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:21,725
I don't really need to pretend, because that's who I am,

130
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:25,396
an emotional vampire.

131
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:27,273
I've just come to expect it...

132
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,400
that vampires are real,

133
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,485
that I was born this way,

134
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,614
that I feed off of other people's real emotions.

135
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:38,700
I search for this night's prey.

136
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:41,953
Who will it be?

137
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:58,594
You look familiar... have we met?

138
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:01,263
I think I fucked her somewhere toward the beginning of term,

139
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,139
the "Wet Wednesday" party.

140
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,224
No.

141
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,186
- What's your name? - Peter.

142
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,606
Really? Aren't you a senior?

143
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,649
No, a freshman.

144
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,360
Really? I thought you were older.

145
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,487
No, I'm a freshman.

146
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,200
Peter. Peter the freshman.

147
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:30,207
She has dick- sucking lips, so I consider the options.

148
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,709
I leave right now, go back to my room,

149
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:36,045
play the guitar...

150
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:40,174
masturbate to broadband- speed Internet porn...

151
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,219
I'm going to come on those tits.

152
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:44,803
...go to sleep.

153
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,679
Or...

154
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,807
I could play "Quarters" with Dickie and Quinlivan

155
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,642
and that dumb guy from LA.

156
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:54,979
Or I could take her to the Carousel for some coffee

157
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,440
and ditch her there with the bill.

158
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,156
Or I could take her back to my room,

159
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,992
hope the Frog is gone, get stoned and fuck her.

160
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:11,870
So, what do you think?

161
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,331
What do I think?

162
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,708
I think, why not?

163
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,836
Rock and roll.

164
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,093
She slowly followed me back to my dorm room

165
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:29,928
like she knew this would happen,

166
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:31,763
too eager, too stunned to speak.

167
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:34,516
I was so excited, I couldn't stop shaking

168
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,310
and I dropped the key when I tried to unlock the door.

169
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:45,651
She sat on the bed and I played her a song I had written myself,

170
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:48,863
then segued into one by Counting Crows.

171
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:52,366
I played it quietly and sang the lyrics slowly and softly.

172
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:56,452
She was so moved that she actually started to cry.

173
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,873
#I'm not ready for this sort of thing...#

174
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:05,253
Maybe it was the Ecstasy I'm pretty sure she was on.

175
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,005
Maybe it was that she thought she really loved me.

176
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,966
But when he kissed her on the lips, he instantly went hard.

177
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,843
She was crying, her face was slick,

178
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,845
but she let let him pull her clothes off.

179
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:18,307
She smelled like sweet fruit. She was small, too.

180
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,142
Her pubic hair was light and sparse.

181
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,560
Yet, when he fingered her, he didn't feel anything...

182
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:24,228
she wasn't getting wet,

183
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,772
even though she was making soft little moans.

184
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:29,358
He was semi- stiff and losing his erection.

185
00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:32,361
Something was wrong, something was missing,

186
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,197
he didn't know what.

187
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:42,913
Confused, he started to fuck her.

188
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:53,088
Before he came, it hit him...

189
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:56,592
he can't remember the last time he had sex sober.

190
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:01,889
Girl: Peter! Oh, Peter!

191
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:40,452
Fuck!

192
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:49,169
#This is stranger than I thought#

193
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:53,256
#Six different ways inside my heart#

194
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:56,801
#And everyone I'll keep tonight#

195
00:17:56,844 --> 00:18:01,222
#Six different ways go deep inside#

196
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:05,016
#I'll tell them anything at all#

197
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,270
#I know I'll give them more and more...#

198
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:28,831
#I'll tell them anything at all#

199
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:32,500
#I know I'll give the world and more#

200
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:36,087
#They think I'm on my hands and head#

201
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,300
#This time they're much too slow#

202
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:44,637
#Six sides to every lie I say#

203
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,515
#It's that American voice again#

204
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,810
#It was never quite like this before#

205
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:55,397
#Not one of you is the same#

206
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:58,025
#To do do do...#

207
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:04,781
You sneaky bitch.

208
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:14,664
Sean's voice: "Got you.

209
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,708
You're mine now for the rest of the day,

210
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:18,919
week, month, year, life.

211
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:22,297
Have you guessed who I am? Sometimes I think you have.

212
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,174
Sometimes, when you're scanning a crowd,

213
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,176
I feel those sultry dark eyes of yours stop on me.

214
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:30,179
Are you too afraid to come up to me and let me know how you feel?

215
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:32,348
I want to moan and writhe with you,

216
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,517
and I want to go up to you and kiss your mouth

217
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,186
and pull you to me and say, 'Love you, love you,'

218
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:38,938
while stripping.

219
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,189
I want you so bad it stings.

220
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,650
I want to kill the ugly girls you're always with.

221
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:46,861
Do you really like those boring, naive, coy, calculating girls,

222
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:48,530
or is it just for sex?

223
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,323
The seeds of love have taken hold,

224
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:53,326
and if we won't burn together, I'll burn alone."

225
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:01,333
#This is stranger than I ever thought.#

226
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,466
What?

227
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:13,761
How'd she do that?

228
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:26,731
Blood clot.

229
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,863
What's going on?

230
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:35,449
You're gonna have to sell that bike of yours,

231
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,200
- that's what's going on - Why?

232
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:41,745
Where's my money, college boy?

233
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:44,415
Do you take American Express?

234
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,250
That's not funny.

235
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:51,796
You like that?

236
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,882
They taught it to me in the Army.

237
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:56,301
One of 1 7 hand- to- hand combat methods

238
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,428
of rendering your enemy defenseless.

239
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:01,389
Now, all I got to do is apply positive pressure

240
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:03,932
to rip your carpals free from your metacarpals,

241
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,435
and you will be unable to operate your weapon!

242
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,979
I'm not your enemy, Rupert, and I don't have a weapon.

243
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:13,776
That's why you get a little time, homes.

244
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:29,373
You want some coke?

245
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:31,625
Sure.

246
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,628
Then buy some of your own, bitch.

247
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,839
Get the fuck out of my crib and get me my money.

248
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:40,675
There's an Orgy Night at Booth House.

249
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,677
I'm scoring for a bunch of freshman.

250
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,638
They're rich, they want cocaine, they'll pay premium to get it.

251
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,723
What do you think?

252
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,437
I think you're a rich motherfucking motherfucker,

253
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,608
who owes me a shitload of motherfucking cash.

254
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,902
That's what I think, you rich motherfucking motherfucker.

255
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,196
You want some blow, motherfucker?

256
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,866
You bring me my motherfucking cash, motherfucker! Fuck you!

257
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,494
Jesus fucking Christ, Rupert, don't get so tense.

258
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,621
I'll show you tense, motherfucker.

259
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:13,997
You're into me for a fuckload of money,

260
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,042
and I think you and your motherfucking rich- kid friends

261
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,337
are gonna take off to all your rich- ass motherfucking lives,

262
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,007
Ieaving me holding my motherfucking dick!

263
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,176
So fuck you!

264
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,513
Fucking, Rupert, fucking A'. I'm not like those rich assholes.

265
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:32,932
I'm on financial aid. I have to work for a living.

266
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm from a fucking farm in Nebraska.

267
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:37,061
My family had to sell the fucking cow to get me here.

268
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:39,397
- I'm working in food service - Bullshit!

269
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:42,441
My father's in the hospital, okay?

270
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:45,986
My family's strapped for cash. I might have to drop out.

271
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:51,616
- Really? - The Lord is my witness. Yes.

272
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,203
You really don't have any fucking cash?

273
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:57,747
No, I had to work all summer just to pay for this term.

274
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:12,093
I thought you went home to New York for the summer.

275
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:16,598
That's what I told people so they wouldn't laugh at me.

276
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:19,851
I actually had to wash pigs all summer, Rupert.

277
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:24,021
Jesus Christ, man, I can get these kids to overpay,

278
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:26,774
they're so desperate for drugs.

279
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:29,568
I'm your key to moving this shit on campus.

280
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:31,945
You need me, and you know it.

281
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,073
And I need the cash. We need each other.

282
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,407
You get this straight, fuckhead.

283
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,367
I need you like I need

284
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,703
a motherfucking asshole on my elbow!

285
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:43,915
Right here! An asshole!

286
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,126
That's how much I need you.

287
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,590
What do you think, Guest?

288
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:57,636
I think you should sniff less cocaine.

289
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:01,139
And stop leaving the gun there laying on the table, man.

290
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,475
Leave the boy alone before he piss in panty.

291
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:10,147
You know I'm just fucking with you, baby, right?

292
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,359
Right.

293
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:18,196
What kind of markup do you think you can get

294
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:20,115
off these rich- ass freshmen?

295
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:23,493
Well, that depends on how stepped- on it is.

296
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:27,414
Stepped- on? Guest, is our shit stepped- on?

297
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:30,208
No, man, it's fresher than the morning snow.

298
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,251
What the bumbaclot wrong with him?

299
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:34,086
Maybe 20% over market value.

300
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:37,047
50%, you say!

301
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,924
Hot damn, college boy!

302
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,176
That's some good motherfucking math!

303
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:44,179
I do believe we have ourselves a deal.

304
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:49,934
Do we have ourselves a deal?

305
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:53,146
Sean: Sure.

306
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:58,818
Good, it's time for you to get to work.

307
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:03,947
Sometimes, a minute...

308
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:09,453
will last like an hour, you know?

309
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:11,955
Where other times...

310
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:14,749
an hour just...

311
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:18,586
just zips by in like a minute.

312
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,717
It's all subjective.

313
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,095
Every person perceives it...

314
00:25:29,138 --> 00:25:31,181
perceives it different.

315
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:34,893
It's like, that's why you can't trust clocks, you know?

316
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:42,067
Marc, you owe me 500 bucks.

317
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:44,985
I want it by Sunday.

318
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:47,196
Okay?

319
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:50,908
You notice I don't have any clocks in my room,

320
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,621
because they interfere with your ability to...

321
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,416
...to adjust the time to...

322
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:04,879
to suit your needs, you know?

323
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:07,882
Marc.

324
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:12,385
Do not be a slave to time, my friend,

325
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:16,223
because, it...

326
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:19,434
there's no point.

327
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,659
I...I can feel my dick.

328
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,120
I can feel my dick.

329
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:42,414
Whoo!

330
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:44,457
Oh my God!

331
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,176
- Hey! Fucking, hey!

332
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:58,595
What about the cash?

333
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:01,515
Marc, what about the fucking cash?

334
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:04,183
What class, man?

335
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:05,935
Who teaches that?

336
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:08,104
Fucking...

337
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:10,940
Just go away, you know.

338
00:27:10,983 --> 00:27:12,608
Just stop bugging me.

339
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:15,570
Just stop asking me. Stop kicking my fucking bed.

340
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:18,613
Stop, you know, oooh...

341
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:22,075
I'll get you your fucking... just don't fuck my karma, dude!

342
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,327
Don't fuck it up!

343
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:42,775
#Get yourself together, get yourself together#

344
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:44,777
#Shake, shake, shake...#

345
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:50,908
#Get yourself together...#

346
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,292
Hi, Mitch. What's up?

347
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:05,422
Not very much. What's up with you?

348
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:07,716
Not much.

349
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:10,008
Can we talk?

350
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:13,220
What do you want to talk about?

351
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:15,264
Just what's going on.

352
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:18,559
Hey, I warned you.

353
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,269
Remember that.

354
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,562
I know, I know.

355
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:25,565
Wait, what did you warn me about?

356
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:28,151
I warned you!

357
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,944
#Shake, shake, shake...#

358
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,532
Wait, Mitch.

359
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,785
Mitch, don't be such a pussy.

360
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:40,954
I am warning you again.

361
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:42,956
I don't know what your fucking problem is.

362
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:45,959
Just stay the fuck aw...

363
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,128
- Hey - Hey, guys.

364
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,964
Is there some sort of problem, Paul and Mitchell?

365
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:55,342
No...you two know each other?

366
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,678
Yeah. Hi.

367
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:58,721
Hi.

368
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:05,560
Mitch, I'm kinda through partying tonight.

369
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:09,856
Do you want to walk me back to my room?

370
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:13,109
My roommate's at her boyfriend's tonight.

371
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,362
Mitch: Yeah.

372
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:18,947
What about you, Paul? What are you doing?

373
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,326
- Come on, let's go - It might be fun.

374
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:24,370
- No - Come on.

375
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:26,872
- Let's go - You know you want to.

376
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,919
- Later, guy - Bye, Paul. Maybe next time.

377
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:45,098
Mr. Bateman.

378
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,826
Excuse you.

379
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,956
Sean Bateman, right?

380
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:15,667
Right. It's Paul?

381
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,670
Right.

382
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,550
The girl with Mitchell?

383
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,971
Paul: You mean, Candice? Her name is Candice.

384
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,763
Yeah, that's right.

385
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,349
I had a class with her, but I failed it.

386
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:35,519
Really? My type of guy.

387
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,521
Fucking keg's dead.

388
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,816
Typical. I wish I had a case of beer.

389
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,817
- Quesadilla? - What?

390
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,154
A quesadilla? Mexican food? El Sombrero?

391
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,032
El Sombrero closed a long time ago.

392
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,325
How about tomorrow night? I'll buy.

393
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,662
I don't know. You'll buy?

394
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,705
Totally buy.

395
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,379
Rock and roll.

396
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,965
Tomorrow, then.

397
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:28,234
#Yellow is the color of my true love's hair#

398
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:34,199
#In the morning, when we rise#

399
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:39,870
#In the morning, when we rise#

400
00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:42,623
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

401
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:45,417
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

402
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,586
#I love the best#

403
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,925
#Green is the color...#

404
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,594
How could you possibly go out this early in the morning?

405
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:59,680
- I've got class - It's Saturday.

406
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:02,850
#When we rise#

407
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:05,936
#In the morning#

408
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:08,480
#When we rise#

409
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:10,315
Merde! What is it?

410
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:12,150
Asshole, turn off the fucking thing!

411
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,653
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

412
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:16,405
#I love the best#

413
00:33:21,451 --> 00:33:26,580
#Blue is the color of the sky#

414
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:32,586
#In the morning, when we rise#

415
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:38,508
#In the morning, when we rise#

416
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:41,636
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

417
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,431
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

418
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:46,807
#I love the best...#

419
00:34:20,923 --> 00:34:25,969
#Mellow is the feeling that I get#

420
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:31,849
#When I see her, hm- mmm#

421
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:37,855
#When I see her, oh, yeah#

422
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:41,025
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

423
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:43,860
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

424
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:46,196
#I love the best#

425
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:55,747
#Freedom is a word I rarely use#

426
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:01,377
#Without thinking, oh, yeah#

427
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:08,008
#Without thinking, hm- mmm#

428
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,510
- #Of the time #- #Of the time#

429
00:35:10,552 --> 00:35:13,471
- #Of the time #- #Of the time#

430
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:15,556
#When I've been loved#

431
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:25,274
#Yellow is the color of my true love's hair#

432
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:27,651
#In the morning#

433
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:31,738
#When we rise#

434
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:37,411
#In the morning, when we rise#

435
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:40,371
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

436
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:43,290
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

437
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,918
#I love the best.#

438
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:12,276
- Hi - Hey.

439
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:13,944
Are you here for that class?

440
00:36:13,987 --> 00:36:16,572
The tutorial on the Post- Modern Condition?

441
00:36:16,613 --> 00:36:18,614
- Yeah - It was canceled.

442
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:20,408
Typical.

443
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:22,160
I've never seen you there before.

444
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:23,786
That's what's so typical.

445
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:26,205
It's the first time I ever bothered to show up for it.

446
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:28,333
Yeah, you've got bad timing.

447
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,752
Saturdays suck ass.

448
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:32,544
I don't have to put up with this shit.

449
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:34,963
I'm dropping this fucking class.

450
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:38,300
- Yeah, me too - Really?

451
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:40,719
Mm- hmm. I think I'm gonna change my major.

452
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:44,473
- To what? - I don't know yet.

453
00:36:44,514 --> 00:36:46,515
- What's yours? - I don't even know.

454
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,148
Your name's Sean Bateman, right?

455
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:56,859
Right. Your name is Lauren.

456
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:59,320
Yeah. I bought pot from you last year.

457
00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:02,113
It was good. A little seedy though.

458
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:04,949
You used to go out with that Paul Denton dude, right?

459
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:07,160
Yeah.

460
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:10,121
Before.

461
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:12,832
Show me your eyes.

462
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:15,542
#...Feeling that I get#

463
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:21,423
#When I see her, hm- mmm#

464
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:27,471
#When I see her, oh, yeah#

465
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,347
- #That's the time #- Rock and roll.

466
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,933
- #That's the time #- #That's the time#

467
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:34,977
- #That's the time #- #I love the best#

468
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:39,440
Maybe I'll see you at the next pre- Saturday- party party.

469
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,441
Or something.

470
00:37:41,484 --> 00:37:45,612
#Freedom is a word I rarely use#

471
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:51,368
#Without thinking, oh, yeah#

472
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:56,790
#Without thinking, mm- hmm#

473
00:37:56,832 --> 00:38:00,376
- #Of the time #- #Of the time#

474
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,920
- #Of the time #- #Of the time#

475
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:05,881
#When I've been loved.#

476
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:50,089
Oh my God. Harry tried to kill himself.

477
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:52,466
Paul's voice: That is so typical.

478
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:54,968
I just knew something like this was going to happen.

479
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:57,471
I just had a feeling that there would be some obstacle,

480
00:38:57,472 --> 00:38:59,348
major or minor, that was going to prevent

481
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,350
my evening with Sean from happening.

482
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:03,769
You've got to come to Fel's house...he's there.

483
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,021
Shit, Jesus, Paul. We've got to do something.

484
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:09,440
That's way too gay.

485
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:12,818
Um... call security?

486
00:39:12,861 --> 00:39:14,945
Trust me, they'll be there within an hour.

487
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:16,947
Security. Security?

488
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:19,699
What do you need, a formal fucking invitation?

489
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:21,743
I have an appointment at 7:00, Raymond!

490
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:25,830
You are killing Harry! Pull it together!

491
00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:27,499
Mach schnell!

492
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:30,794
What did he do, try to OD on Sudafed and wine coolers?

493
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:35,214
Oh, my God. I brought Paul.

494
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:38,133
- What did he take? - I don't know.

495
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,469
Oh, Harry, sweetie, are you okay?

496
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,638
He's going to get death of cold.

497
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,933
I think we should take him to Dunham Hospital.

498
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:48,309
That's all the way in fucking Keene! Are you crazy?

499
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:51,270
- Where else is there, asshole? - I have to meet someone at 7:00.

500
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:53,231
Fuck your meeting! Get the car, Raymond!

501
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,858
Grab his feet! Jesus!

502
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:57,986
Jesus, this is so typical.

503
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:02,531
He found out he was adopted today.

504
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:04,950
Could we stop at a Circle K and get some cigarettes?

505
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:07,160
I remind you we have somebody OD'ing back here.

506
00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:08,912
He's not OD'ing.

507
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:11,248
He's a freshman. Freshman don't OD.

508
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:15,168
Fuck you, Paul! Oh shit, he's throwing up!

509
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,295
- Open the fucking window! - He's not throwing up.

510
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:20,506
Then what do you call that "ccchhh" sound, huh?

511
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:22,675
Dry heaves. He's forgetting to breathe

512
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:24,593
and he has a lot of air in his stomach.

513
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:26,303
Maybe you should be inducing vomiting.

514
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:28,513
Should I just pull the car over?!

515
00:40:28,597 --> 00:40:31,182
- Can I change the CD? - Shut up, Paul!

516
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:32,851
You're going to be okay.

517
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:37,147
#Blue- eyed dressed for every situation#

518
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:40,317
#Moving through the doorway of the nation#

519
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:49,783
- Come on, grab his arm - Oh, God.

520
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:52,328
Okay, you're gonna make it.

521
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,912
Both: Help!

522
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,789
- Help! - We need some help over here.

523
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,334
- Please! This guy's OD'ing! - Oh my God.

524
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:02,128
Will you get him into the Emergency Room?

525
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,047
- Thank God - I'm on my break.

526
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,215
I there anyone else around here, please?!

527
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:07,967
- Hello? - Please take care of Harry.

528
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,801
Please, you've got to take care of him!

529
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:11,678
- Move, move! - Oh, God. Oh, God.

530
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:13,555
Sir, can I speak to your manager, please?

531
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,724
Will you get him up. His name's Harry, please!

532
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,351
- What's his name? - Harry.

533
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,436
- Harry - Harry, Harry.

534
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:25,149
I'm not getting any pulse.

535
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,151
Is this a joke?

536
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,570
I can see him moving. He's not dead.

537
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,948
- I can see him breathing - He's dead, Paul, shut up!

538
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,326
And how did this happen, exactly?

539
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,869
- Oh God, I don't know! - Oh God, oh God!

540
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,122
Will you shut up? He's not dead.

541
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,625
He hasn't got a pulse. There's no heartbeat.

542
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,627
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

543
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,045
Harry, please come back.

544
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,215
Sorry, there's nothing more I can do here.

545
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:52,049
You have to do something.

546
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,051
I've seen this on ER. Please fix him!

547
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,470
Harry's gone bye- bye. Harry's gone to the big bye- bye.

548
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:59,556
He's got his name in the papers on the back side.

549
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,977
It's "'toe- tag time' in Teenville" tonight. Again.

550
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:04,394
- What? - Teenville?

551
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,396
You should've just said no, Harry.

552
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,106
- I'm not dead, am I? - Ahh!

553
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,149
Yes, you are! Shut up!

554
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:12,652
Actually, you don't have a pulse. I think you're dead.

555
00:42:12,653 --> 00:42:15,571
If you let me run a few tests, I could probably prove it.

556
00:42:15,614 --> 00:42:17,907
- You've got a malpractice suit! - Harry is dead.

557
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,783
You don't know what you're talking about!

558
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:22,411
Harry: Seriously, am I dead?

559
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:26,415
A few tests on Harry, I'm sure I could prove he's dead.

560
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:29,710
No! Pain and suffering!

561
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,879
I must insist you bring back your friend's corpse

562
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,798
for me to do some tests.

563
00:42:44,807 --> 00:42:47,726
Is your ultimate deterrent to a Friday night party working?

564
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:49,769
Sort of.

565
00:42:49,812 --> 00:42:51,771
The best would be Victor though.

566
00:42:51,856 --> 00:42:55,317
Okay, enough fantasizing. Victor is 3000 miles away.

567
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,986
Use the book.

568
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:00,447
Okay, how do I look?

569
00:43:00,488 --> 00:43:03,282
You look kinda skinny, actually.

570
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:06,201
Skinny? Really?

571
00:43:06,202 --> 00:43:08,162
Bulimic skinny or anorexic skinny?

572
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:09,747
What's the difference?

573
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:11,707
Bulimic skinny passes for healthy,

574
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,627
except your teeth rot, but my teeth aren't rotting, so...

575
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,003
So you look bulimic skinny?

576
00:43:17,046 --> 00:43:18,921
Lauren, I'm telling you,

577
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:21,633
it's amazing the weight you lose when you get off the pill.

578
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:24,844
Yeah, until the 50 pounds you gain when you get knocked up.

579
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,512
Okay, well, do the math.

580
00:43:26,554 --> 00:43:29,723
If a condom is 98% safe, and he wears two,

581
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:32,017
then you're 196% safe.

582
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,686
That is a much better percentage than the pill can offer.

583
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:36,563
I don't think it works that way, Lara.

584
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:40,192
Abstinence is 1 00% safe, which is less of a percentage than...

585
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:42,652
Whatever, I don't care. I don't major in math.

586
00:43:42,694 --> 00:43:45,821
- So are you coming or not? - I don't know.

587
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:48,741
Lauren, listen to your friend and roommate.

588
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:50,534
If you spend the rest of your life

589
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:53,204
waiting for Victor, you're never gonna lose your virginity.

590
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:55,915
You can't just wait for destiny to play itself out.

591
00:43:55,957 --> 00:43:58,041
You have to make it happen.

592
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:30,738
Is she coming tonight?

593
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:33,116
- I doubt it - Why?

594
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:35,743
- She's been looking at the book - What book?

595
00:44:35,785 --> 00:44:38,495
It's this big medical book she's got of venereal diseases.

596
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:41,164
Before a party, she looks through it to discourage herself

597
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:43,041
from hooking up with people like you.

598
00:44:43,084 --> 00:44:44,918
It's got some pretty nasty imagery.

599
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:47,379
And it helps her keep her focused on her homework.

600
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:53,009
- So, she's not coming, then? - Nope.

601
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:55,761
So, you want to get me another beer?

602
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:15,989
Hey, Sean. Sorry I'm late.

603
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:17,782
What?

604
00:45:17,824 --> 00:45:20,451
There was this whole thing... I had to take this freshman

605
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:23,787
to the hospital and there was this sick kid and, anyhow, I'm...

606
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,998
What the fuck are you talking about?

607
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:29,001
- I'm here - Never mind.

608
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:32,379
- I'll make it up to you - You don't have to.

609
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:35,131
I know I don't have to, but I want to.

610
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:37,467
- I insist - Whatever.

611
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:39,260
Really.

612
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:43,473
I have some pot in my room

613
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:45,308
if you want to smoke and get stoned.

614
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,102
- You have pot? - In my room, yeah.

615
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:54,816
- Want a beer? - Let's go.

616
00:46:00,322 --> 00:46:03,407
Hey, Lauren, this is...

617
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:06,160
- Jim - Jim, from Dartmouth.

618
00:46:06,203 --> 00:46:08,663
- Hi - Brewski for you- ski?

619
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:12,041
- Sure - Hey, you want it you got it.

620
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:17,963
He thinks this is the "Dress to Get Screwed" party.

621
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:19,839
If you want him, I'll give him to ya.

622
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:22,217
No, that's okay.

623
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:25,428
You sure? 'Cause I don't see Victor around.

624
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:27,847
What about Sean Bateman? Have you seen him around?

625
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:31,016
Yeah, actually, Sean Bateman just ran off with Paul.

626
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:33,060
- Paul Denton? - Uh- huh.

627
00:46:33,103 --> 00:46:35,020
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

628
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:37,398
You don't think... no.

629
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:40,109
- I don't know - No.

630
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:42,277
He must just be selling him something.

631
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:44,153
- Must be - Must be.

632
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:46,406
Yeah.

633
00:46:46,448 --> 00:46:49,701
Okay, so what is this? Are you out on the prowl again?

634
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,787
Yeah, that book's just not...it's not doing it.

635
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,580
- No? - Huh- uh.

636
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:59,376
Good. Okay, well, just don't wait up for me, okay?

637
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:01,253
- Okay - Okay.

638
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:03,380
Okay.

639
00:47:05,717 --> 00:47:08,302
Miss Lauren Hynde.

640
00:47:08,343 --> 00:47:13,055
Why weren't you at my tutorial last Saturday?

641
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:22,148
Would you like a drink?

642
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,274
Come here.

643
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:26,540
- Mmm? - Mm- hmm.

644
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:29,251
- Yeah

645
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:44,683
- Do you want a turn- on? - No thanks.

646
00:48:44,724 --> 00:48:46,684
Well...

647
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,316
don't mind if I do.

648
00:49:05,035 --> 00:49:08,413
Are we going to do it here on the couch?

649
00:49:08,455 --> 00:49:10,623
Do what?

650
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,166
You know, do it.

651
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:14,502
What?

652
00:49:14,544 --> 00:49:16,545
Fuck?

653
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:19,673
Oh, are you mad?

654
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:21,508
I would lose my tenure.

655
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:24,177
And I'm a married man.

656
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:28,056
But aren't you hitting on me?

657
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:32,184
Well, for a hummer, sure.

658
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,357
I've heard you're talented, Miss Hynde.

659
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:43,987
And it certainly can't hurt your GPA.

660
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:48,325
So, shall we?

661
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:27,569
So where did you spend last summer?

662
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:31,657
- Berlin - Paul: Sprechen sie Deutsch?

663
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:34,451
What?

664
00:50:34,494 --> 00:50:37,704
- Do you speak German? - No.

665
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:41,207
- What the f...? - You don't?

666
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,087
No. Why?

667
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:49,257
Well, I don't know.

668
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:53,177
I just assumed, since you spent the summer in Berlin...

669
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,136
I thought maybe you...

670
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:57,764
No. Berlin, New Hampshire.

671
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:06,064
Sean's voice: I need to get some more pot.

672
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,816
I'm running out.

673
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,735
And I need to get laid.

674
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:14,738
Where the fuck was Lauren tonight?

675
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:18,450
Lara's kind of hot. I could bang her and feel good about it.

676
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,952
I'd rather have Lauren.

677
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,079
I wonder why.

678
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:27,959
It would just ruin my illusion of her innocence,

679
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,877
her purity.

680
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,547
Whoa!

681
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,923
Is that really what I want?

682
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:40,137
I need to fuck someone.

683
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:42,472
Then I need to get more pot.

684
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:46,518
Paul's voice: I watched him with growing intensity

685
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,313
as he refilled the pipe in the dark and smoky din of the room.

686
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:52,857
He delicately fingered what looked like dried moss to me,

687
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:55,151
and it struck me then that I liked Sean

688
00:51:55,193 --> 00:51:58,779
because he looked slutty, a boy who'd been around.

689
00:51:58,821 --> 00:52:02,073
A boy who couldn't remember if he was Catholic or not.

690
00:52:16,546 --> 00:52:19,590
#Whooo...#

691
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:36,356
#I don't know what color your eyes are, baby#

692
00:52:36,398 --> 00:52:40,443
#But your hair is long and brown#

693
00:52:40,526 --> 00:52:44,404
#Your legs are strong and so, so long#

694
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:48,533
#And you don't come from this town#

695
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:52,579
#My head is full of magic, baby#

696
00:52:52,622 --> 00:52:56,708
#And I have to share this with you#

697
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,711
#I feel I'm on top again, baby#

698
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:04,382
#That's got everything to do with you#

699
00:53:04,424 --> 00:53:06,717
#I'm alive#

700
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:10,388
#So alive.#

701
00:53:21,203 --> 00:53:23,622
Woman on TV: Suck it harder!

702
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:26,375
Look at that chick's cans.

703
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:29,628
- Implants - I like the feel of fake tits.

704
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:35,008
- I need to get cable in my room - Hello?

705
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:38,762
Hi, Mom.

706
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:41,223
- What's going on?

707
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:44,560
Sean: You are one dirty bitch!

708
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:46,979
Paul: Tomorrow? The Jareds are coming?

709
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:49,106
Oh.

710
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:55,654
Does it have to be this weekend? I have a lot of schoolwork.

711
00:53:55,738 --> 00:53:59,199
- How about next weekend? - Faggoty sitcom,

712
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:01,994
- faggoty sitcom... - Paul: Richard?

713
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,205
Okay.

714
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:07,332
Yeah, you too.

715
00:54:11,462 --> 00:54:13,964
I have to go into the city tomorrow night.

716
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:17,092
Rock and roll.

717
00:54:17,134 --> 00:54:19,762
- You want to go? - Nope.

718
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:22,222
"Dressed to Get Screwed Party" is tomorrow night.

719
00:54:23,223 --> 00:54:25,851
I know, and I don't want to leave you here alone.

720
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:28,812
Deal with it. I'm borrowing these.

721
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:30,481
Wait.

722
00:54:30,522 --> 00:54:33,817
Would you give me a ride to the bus station tomorrow?

723
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:37,988
Whatever. Look, I have to meet my advisor.

724
00:54:55,047 --> 00:54:57,007
Paul's voice: I shouldn't be leaving.

725
00:54:57,049 --> 00:55:00,844
He'll sleep with someone else. It's the "Dressed to Get Screwed Party."

726
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:03,389
What the fuck am I doing?

727
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:07,142
I love you, Sean Bateman.

728
00:55:10,938 --> 00:55:13,982
Sean's voice: I wonder if Lauren goes wild during sex.

729
00:55:14,024 --> 00:55:16,693
I wonder if she comes easily.

730
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:20,239
Or at all. I won't go to bed with a girl who doesn't.

731
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,116
If I can't make a girl come, why bother?

732
00:55:22,157 --> 00:55:24,368
It would be like asking questions in a letter.

733
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:27,162
Mmmm...

734
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:28,997
I'm hungry.

735
00:56:41,904 --> 00:56:43,864
So, tonight's the night?

736
00:56:43,906 --> 00:56:46,200
- I'm going all the way - Who's the lucky boy?

737
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:48,702
- I'm not telling - You will if you want the room.

738
00:56:48,744 --> 00:56:50,037
Okay, okay...

739
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,582
- Sean Bateman - He's a drug dealer.

740
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:56,126
- He made me "zzshing"! - "Zzshing"?

741
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:59,963
"Zzshing" like you just know that you'll be with that person

742
00:57:00,005 --> 00:57:01,882
and something amazing will happen,

743
00:57:01,924 --> 00:57:05,719
like he just fucking fucks you right up the...

744
00:57:05,761 --> 00:57:07,763
"Zzshing."

745
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:11,016
- No, I've never heard that - You will someday.

746
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,852
You know, you might be afflicted with synesthesia.

747
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:15,062
What?

748
00:57:15,104 --> 00:57:16,939
It's a clinical disorder which causes you

749
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,650
to hear what you see and see what you hear...

750
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:21,693
an uncontrolled combination of your senses.

751
00:57:21,777 --> 00:57:23,695
You should really get that checked out.

752
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:26,907
- Prozac might help - What?

753
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,700
Aaah!

754
00:57:31,912 --> 00:57:33,580
Oooh...

755
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:38,460
Rusty pipes.

756
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:45,300
#And the thought of rubbing feet is getting so exciting#

757
00:57:45,384 --> 00:57:48,470
#Skyrocket in flight#

758
00:57:48,554 --> 00:57:52,391
#Afternoon delight.#

759
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:09,908
Hello?

760
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:13,203
Can I talk to Sean Bateman? I think he lives upstairs.

761
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,141
Yeah?

762
00:58:34,183 --> 00:58:36,185
Sean.

763
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:37,978
Who is this, Patrick?

764
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,440
Who the hell is Patrick? No, it's is Paul.

765
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:44,193
Paul...?

766
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:47,154
Yeah, remember me?

767
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:50,240
Sean: No. This better be good.

768
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:53,744
I was just wondering what was going on. Who's Patrick?

769
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:55,662
It's none of your business, what do you want?

770
00:58:55,704 --> 00:58:57,456
Paul: Were you asleep?

771
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:00,959
- No, of course not - What are you doing?

772
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:03,003
That's none of your fucking business.

773
00:59:03,045 --> 00:59:04,797
I'm getting ready to go to this party.

774
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:07,049
With who? With Patrick?

775
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:08,842
No.

776
00:59:08,884 --> 00:59:12,012
With the person who's leaving notes in my box.

777
00:59:12,054 --> 00:59:14,348
- Are you? - Deal with it.

778
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:18,185
- Are you just fucking with me? - Rock and roll.

779
00:59:18,227 --> 00:59:21,188
Motherfucker!

780
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,440
Who?

781
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:29,988
Oh, Jesus Christ, Richard, is that you?

782
00:59:30,072 --> 00:59:35,327
It's Dick. And yes, it's me.

783
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:46,713
What the hell are you doing?

784
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:49,383
Getting fucked up.

785
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:52,553
Maybe getting fucked.

786
00:59:56,974 --> 00:59:59,017
Oh, Richard.

787
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:05,107
All right, Richard...

788
01:00:05,149 --> 01:00:08,610
Oh, yeah, you're just turning me on, Richard.

789
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,654
Richard: Ride 'em cowboy!

790
01:00:10,696 --> 01:00:12,823
Paul...!

791
01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:14,867
You remember Mrs. Jared?

792
01:00:14,908 --> 01:00:18,579
Of course. Hello, Mrs. Jared.

793
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,622
I leave you alone for five minutes and you're drinking.

794
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:22,916
Drunk. I'm drunk.

795
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:25,461
Mrs. Jared: Then take a shower and sober up.

796
01:00:25,502 --> 01:00:29,840
Oh, my tortures never end. How are you, Paul?

797
01:00:29,882 --> 01:00:31,633
Fine.

798
01:00:31,717 --> 01:00:34,970
Would you talk to him? He'll listen to you.

799
01:00:35,012 --> 01:00:37,306
Come on, Myra.

800
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:43,771
I'll see you both downstairs in 15 minutes, hmm?

801
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:57,785
You want to take a shower with me...

802
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:01,246
for old times' sake?

803
01:01:10,547 --> 01:01:13,634
- Want one? - What are they?

804
01:01:13,675 --> 01:01:16,678
- Does it matter? - No.

805
01:01:16,678 --> 01:01:18,764
#Oh well, I guess it would be nice#

806
01:01:18,806 --> 01:01:21,350
#If I could touch your body#

807
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:23,811
#I know not everybody#

808
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:26,313
#Has got a body like you#

809
01:01:26,355 --> 01:01:28,690
#But I've gotta think twice#

810
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:31,568
#Before I give my heart away#

811
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,737
#And I know all the games you play#

812
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:36,073
#Because I play them too...#

813
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:37,491
Fine with me.

814
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:44,123
So when she showed up...

815
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:47,584
#Oh baby, I reconsider#

816
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:50,129
#My foolish notion#

817
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,297
#Well, I need someone to hold me#

818
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:54,466
#But I wait for something more#

819
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:56,969
#Yes, I gotta have faith#

820
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,430
#I gotta have faith#

821
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:01,974
#'Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith,#

822
01:02:02,057 --> 01:02:05,227
#I gotta have faith, faith, faith...#

823
01:02:06,562 --> 01:02:08,147
Oh, yeah.

824
01:02:08,188 --> 01:02:10,149
#Got to, got to have faith#

825
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:14,862
#Before this river, becomes an ocean#

826
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:19,199
#Before you throw my heart back on the floor#

827
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:22,077
#Oh baby, I reconsider#

828
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:24,663
#My foolish notion#

829
01:02:24,705 --> 01:02:26,874
#Well, I need someone to hold me#

830
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:30,043
#But I'll wait for something more#

831
01:02:31,587 --> 01:02:34,006
#'Cause I gotta have faith#

832
01:02:34,047 --> 01:02:36,550
#Ooh, I gotta have faith#

833
01:02:36,592 --> 01:02:39,219
#'Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith,#

834
01:02:39,261 --> 01:02:42,514
#I gotta have faith, faith faith.#

835
01:02:42,556 --> 01:02:45,809
Mrs. Denton: Then I realized my Cadillac had been stolen.

836
01:02:45,893 --> 01:02:47,394
Mrs. Jared: Oh, my God.

837
01:02:47,478 --> 01:02:49,897
Mrs. Denton: Stolen. The police couldn't have cared less.

838
01:02:49,938 --> 01:02:52,608
They said my insurance would take care of it.

839
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:56,862
Frankly, I was getting sick of the color, you know?

840
01:02:56,904 --> 01:02:59,323
Mrs. Jared: I'm going to ask one more time, Richard,

841
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:02,367
kindly remove your sunglasses.

842
01:03:07,331 --> 01:03:09,500
Very well, then...

843
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:13,128
why don't you tell us about school?

844
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,380
Tell us about school.

845
01:03:17,591 --> 01:03:21,053
- Ciggy - Oh, Ri...don't smoke.

846
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:23,847
You're not allowed to smoke here, Richard...

847
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:28,894
- ...I don't think...- My name is not Richard.

848
01:03:31,063 --> 01:03:33,023
- Then what is it? - Dick.

849
01:03:33,065 --> 01:03:35,067
- What? - Dick.

850
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:38,821
You heard me. Dick.

851
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:41,949
No. Your name is Richard.

852
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:44,701
Sorry, it's Dick.

853
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:53,377
Well, then...Dick, how is school?

854
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,796
It sucks cock.

855
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:04,263
Yeah, it does.

856
01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:07,808
And what classes are you taking...Dick?

857
01:04:09,518 --> 01:04:11,603
"Gang Bang 1 01,"

858
01:04:11,645 --> 01:04:13,397
"Freebase Tutorial"...

859
01:04:13,439 --> 01:04:16,442
and "Oral Sex Workshop."

860
01:04:24,658 --> 01:04:27,661
Well, then, how are you liking that, Dick?

861
01:04:29,705 --> 01:04:31,498
Yeah.

862
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:35,794
"How do you like that?"

863
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,340
What has happened to you?

864
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:42,384
What do you mean, what has happened to me?

865
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:43,677
What do you think?

866
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:46,930
I can see what that school has done to you.

867
01:04:46,972 --> 01:04:50,642
Maybe perhaps Paul and I should go upstairs...

868
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:52,144
- Mrs. Jared: No - Mrs. Denton: No?

869
01:04:52,227 --> 01:04:54,062
No. If anyone is going to leave this table,

870
01:04:54,104 --> 01:04:56,398
- it's going to be Richard - It's Dick!

871
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,067
Leave the table now, Richard.

872
01:04:59,109 --> 01:05:02,029
Why? Why?

873
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:04,615
I'm asking you to leave the table, now.

874
01:05:04,656 --> 01:05:06,617
No, no, no...

875
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:10,996
I will not leave the table. No!

876
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:13,248
Leave the table!

877
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:16,210
Well, fuck you- ooo!

878
01:05:17,628 --> 01:05:21,673
And fuck you. And fuck you, pretty boy.

879
01:05:21,757 --> 01:05:24,468
And fuck you all very much.

880
01:05:25,636 --> 01:05:27,763
I'm outta here.

881
01:05:29,223 --> 01:05:31,350
Have a good one!

882
01:05:43,904 --> 01:05:46,073
Mrs. Jared: Oh, everything's fine now.

883
01:05:46,115 --> 01:05:48,492
No, really. I'm terribly sorry.

884
01:05:48,534 --> 01:05:50,911
- Man: Are you sure, ma'am? - Oh, positive. Yes.

885
01:05:50,953 --> 01:05:53,497
- My son isn't well - Yeah.

886
01:05:53,539 --> 01:05:55,332
He's...well, not well.

887
01:05:55,374 --> 01:05:57,209
He's been under a lot of stress, midterms starting...

888
01:05:57,251 --> 01:06:00,712
School. Yes, of course.

889
01:06:00,712 --> 01:06:02,923
I would like another Vodka Collins.

890
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:04,925
Eve, would you like anything?

891
01:06:04,967 --> 01:06:09,346
Yes...well, I mean, no, no.

892
01:06:09,388 --> 01:06:11,390
Go ahead.

893
01:06:11,473 --> 01:06:13,267
Get her another one.

894
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:15,769
- Please - Thank you, Paul.

895
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:18,564
Sure, Mom.

896
01:06:20,732 --> 01:06:22,693
You know,

897
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:26,363
I think my next car

898
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:28,866
is going to be blue.

899
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:31,160
Blue, don't you think? A very dark blue.

900
01:06:31,201 --> 01:06:33,245
What do you think, Paul?

901
01:06:36,123 --> 01:06:38,083
Blue.

902
01:06:47,926 --> 01:06:49,887
#Baby girl, where you at?#

903
01:06:49,928 --> 01:06:52,181
#Got no strings, got men attached#

904
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:56,477
#Can't stop that feeling for long, no#

905
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:58,479
#You making dogs wanna beg#

906
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,773
#Breaking them off your fancy legs#

907
01:07:00,814 --> 01:07:05,778
#But they make you feel right at home, now#

908
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:10,699
#See all these illusions just take us too long#

909
01:07:10,783 --> 01:07:13,118
#And I want it bad#

910
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,454
#Because you walk pretty, because you talk pretty#

911
01:07:15,537 --> 01:07:19,041
#'Cause you make me sick and I'm not leaving#

912
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:23,170
#Till you're leaving oh, I swear there's something

913
01:07:23,212 --> 01:07:25,297
#When she's pumping asking for a raise...#

914
01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:38,966
Those are grown in shit.

915
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:41,344
#So does she want me to buy her things?#

916
01:07:41,385 --> 01:07:44,222
#On my house, on my job on my loot, shoes#

917
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:46,974
#My shirt, my crew, my mind my father's last name?#

918
01:07:47,016 --> 01:07:49,143
#When I get you alone...#

919
01:07:48,705 --> 01:07:51,416
Thank God you're still dealing.

920
01:07:51,499 --> 01:07:54,377
So where's Lauren?

921
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:56,963
She's out of town.

922
01:07:57,005 --> 01:08:00,592
Do you have a thing for her?

923
01:08:00,634 --> 01:08:03,595
She won't put out. You know that, right?

924
01:08:03,637 --> 01:08:07,682
She's got this little boyfriend who she's saving herself for.

925
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:10,894
You're just wasting your time and money.

926
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:13,563
She's got a boyfriend?

927
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:17,651
#All these intrusions just take us too long#

928
01:08:17,692 --> 01:08:20,528
#And I want you so bad#

929
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,906
#Because you walk city, because you talk city#

930
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:24,824
#'Cause you make me sick...#

931
01:08:24,866 --> 01:08:27,327
Yes, yes, yes.

932
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:31,957
Yes, yes, oh, oh, oh...!

933
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:46,429
Hi, Sean.

934
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:00,819
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.

935
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:02,904
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...

936
01:09:04,572 --> 01:09:06,950
Sean's voice: Disillusionment strikes.

937
01:09:06,992 --> 01:09:08,952
After all my pining for Lauren,

938
01:09:08,994 --> 01:09:12,247
this...her roommate.

939
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:14,749
The inevitable conclusion.

940
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:18,962
It's like bad poetry... and then what?

941
01:09:19,004 --> 01:09:21,172
I'm still hard, so I keep on going.

942
01:09:21,214 --> 01:09:25,593
She's groaning now. Humping up, down, up.

943
01:09:25,635 --> 01:09:27,929
Is it ever going to end?

944
01:09:27,971 --> 01:09:30,056
I should never have done this.

945
01:09:30,098 --> 01:09:32,559
I should have kept it innocent.

946
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:34,644
God, oh yes.

947
01:09:34,728 --> 01:09:37,480
I put my hand over her mouth.

948
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:40,275
She comes, licking my palms, snorting.

949
01:09:41,526 --> 01:09:44,321
It's over.

950
01:09:44,362 --> 01:09:46,489
Kleenex.

951
01:10:12,557 --> 01:10:16,311
What's wrong? I told you I came.

952
01:10:20,815 --> 01:10:24,903
I was born in a Holiday Inn.

953
01:10:24,945 --> 01:10:27,614
Sean: Better it's not Lauren. Note to self:

954
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:31,034
never 'shroom again. Only gets you into trouble.

955
01:10:34,537 --> 01:10:36,498
Woman: I've written you this last letter

956
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:38,750
because I know I'll never have you.

957
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:40,835
I stood in a corner and watched you go off with her.

958
01:10:40,919 --> 01:10:43,254
She's so beneath you.

959
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:45,131
You probably did it just to hurt me.

960
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:46,925
Well, it worked. You hurt me,

961
01:10:47,008 --> 01:10:49,052
and now there's nothing else I can do.

962
01:10:49,135 --> 01:10:52,222
There won't be any more notes. It's last call.

963
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:03,400
#No, I can't forget this evening#

964
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:06,987
#Or your face as you were leaving#

965
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:14,369
#But I guess that's just the way the story goes#

966
01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:17,956
#You always smile but in your eyes#

967
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:22,085
#Your sorrow shows#

968
01:11:22,168 --> 01:11:26,631
#Yes, it shows#

969
01:11:29,634 --> 01:11:33,263
#No, I can't forget tomorrow#

970
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:37,809
#When I think of all my sorrow#

971
01:11:37,851 --> 01:11:39,769
#When I had you there#

972
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:44,274
#But then I let you go#

973
01:11:44,316 --> 01:11:46,776
#And now it's only fair#

974
01:11:46,818 --> 01:11:51,615
#That I should let you know#

975
01:11:51,656 --> 01:11:56,620
#What you should know...#

976
01:11:56,661 --> 01:11:59,914
#Know...#

977
01:11:59,956 --> 01:12:05,462
#I can't live#

978
01:12:05,503 --> 01:12:07,422
#If living is without you#

979
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:10,759
#I can't live#

980
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,638
#I can't give anymore#

981
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:18,600
#I can't live#

982
01:12:18,683 --> 01:12:22,062
#If living is without you#

983
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:25,565
#I can't give#

984
01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:30,820
#I can't give anymore#

985
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:34,574
#Well, I can't forget this evening#

986
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:38,078
#Or your face as you were leaving#

987
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:44,793
#But I guess that's just the way the story goes#

988
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:48,838
#You always smile but in your eyes#

989
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,425
#Your sorrow shows#

990
01:12:52,467 --> 01:12:57,514
#Yes, it shows...#

991
01:14:41,576 --> 01:14:44,204
I only did it with her because I'm in love with you.

992
01:16:43,281 --> 01:16:45,408
Lauren, I love you.

993
01:16:47,619 --> 01:16:49,746
Laur...

994
01:16:52,123 --> 01:16:53,917
- Lauren...! - Leave, Sean!

995
01:16:53,959 --> 01:16:56,252
Since when does fucking somebody else

996
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:58,380
mean that I'm not faithful to you?

997
01:16:58,463 --> 01:17:00,548
Lauren...

998
01:17:03,635 --> 01:17:07,347
She's not ever going to want see you again.

999
01:17:14,646 --> 01:17:16,773
Lara: Face it...

1000
01:17:16,815 --> 01:17:19,651
you fucked up.

1001
01:18:18,335 --> 01:18:21,171
- Hello? - Frenchman: Hello?

1002
01:18:21,212 --> 01:18:22,672
Hello?

1003
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:24,966
- Hello, Bertrand? - Bertrand's not in.

1004
01:18:25,008 --> 01:18:27,344
Is it Jean- Jacques? Hello?

1005
01:19:02,921 --> 01:19:04,881
Lauren...

1006
01:19:21,481 --> 01:19:24,776
Fuck! Fuck!

1007
01:19:35,787 --> 01:19:37,998
Come on.

1008
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,795
Woman announcer: Results are evident in a few short weeks.

1009
01:20:25,837 --> 01:20:27,464
Male announcer: Call and order your bottle of "Longitude"

1010
01:20:27,505 --> 01:20:31,092
having your credit card ready and calling 1- 800- 51 8- 3492.

1011
01:20:31,134 --> 01:20:33,595
That's 1- 800- 51 8- 3492.

1012
01:20:33,637 --> 01:20:36,306
Imagine the look on her face if you were much larger.

1013
01:20:36,348 --> 01:20:38,850
Call now... 1- 800- 51 8- 3492.

1015
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:44,648
- Typical - Radio: #WTNA...#

1016
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:47,233
#Tom and Andy... More music.#

1017
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:59,329
#Could be wrong#

1018
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:02,832
#I could be right#

1019
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:10,256
#Could be wrong...#

1020
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:15,553
#I could be wrong I could be right...#

1021
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:35,156
Sean...?

1022
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:37,492
#May the road rise with you#

1023
01:21:37,534 --> 01:21:41,496
#May the road rise with you...#

1024
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,548
Gotcha.

1025
01:21:52,632 --> 01:21:55,176
You're so sad.

1026
01:21:55,218 --> 01:21:57,721
Sean, you're sick.

1027
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:03,059
Hey... wait a minute.

1028
01:22:14,154 --> 01:22:16,323
Yeah.

1029
01:22:22,245 --> 01:22:25,081
#I could be wrong I could be right#

1030
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:27,876
#I could be black I could be white...#

1031
01:22:37,469 --> 01:22:39,429
Victor: Took a charter flight on a DC- 1 0 to London,

1032
01:22:39,471 --> 01:22:41,431
Ianded at Heathrow. Took a cab to the city center.

1033
01:22:41,473 --> 01:22:43,224
Don't let people lie to you, hostels are for the ugly.

1034
01:22:43,266 --> 01:22:45,018
I'm staying at Home House, the most beautiful hotel.

1035
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,020
Called a friend from school who was selling hash,

1036
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,730
but she wasn't in. Met a couple of Brits

1037
01:22:48,772 --> 01:22:50,231
who take me to of all places, Camden Street.

1038
01:22:50,273 --> 01:22:52,359
I flirt a bit at the Virgin Megastore, buy some CDs,

1039
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,402
then follow some girls with pink hair.

1040
01:22:54,444 --> 01:22:56,404
I wandered around trying to get laid until it started to rain,

1041
01:22:56,446 --> 01:22:58,114
then went back to Home House. "Ministry of Sound" is dead,

1042
01:22:58,156 --> 01:22:59,824
so I go to "Rem Forum," but it's "Gay Night."

1043
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:02,535
I find one hetero girl and we dry- hump on the dance floor.

1044
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,579
We cab it back to Home House, I strip her clothes off

1045
01:23:04,621 --> 01:23:06,957
suck her toes and we fuck. Hung out for four or five days,

1046
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:08,833
met the world's biggest DJ, Paul Oakenfold.

1047
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,210
Kept missing the Changing of the Guards.

1048
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,212
Wrote my mom a postcard I never sent, bought speed

1049
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,130
from an Italian junkie trying to sell me a stolen bike.

1050
01:23:14,172 --> 01:23:16,174
Smoked a lot of hash that had too much tobacco in it.

1051
01:23:16,216 --> 01:23:17,509
Saw the Tate. Saw Big Ben.

1052
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:19,719
Ate a lot of weird English food. It rained a lot.

1053
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,638
It was expensive and I'm jonesing...split for Amsterdam.

1054
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,640
The Dutch all know English so I didn't have to speak Dutch,

1055
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,809
which was a relief. I cruise the red light district,

1056
01:23:25,892 --> 01:23:27,644
visit a sex show, visit a sex museum,

1057
01:23:27,686 --> 01:23:29,771
smoke a lot of hash. I meet a Dutch TV actress

1058
01:23:29,813 --> 01:23:31,273
and we drink absinthe at a bar called "Absinthe."

1059
01:23:31,356 --> 01:23:33,483
The museums were cool. Lots of Van Goghs

1060
01:23:33,566 --> 01:23:35,110
and the Vermeers were intense. Wandered around,

1061
01:23:35,193 --> 01:23:36,987
bought a lot of pastries, ate some intense waffles.

1062
01:23:37,028 --> 01:23:39,572
Bought some coke and I cruised the red light district

1063
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,075
I found some blonde with big tits that reminds me of Lara.

1064
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,244
I gave her 1 00 guilders. In the end, she pulls me out,

1065
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:45,954
I come between her tits even though I'm wearing a rubber.

1066
01:23:45,996 --> 01:23:48,623
We made small talk about AIDS, her Moroccan pimp and herself.

1067
01:23:48,665 --> 01:23:50,000
I wake to the sound of a wino singing.

1068
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:52,002
It's 8:00 a.m. and hot as blazes.

1069
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:53,878
I pretend to ice- skate around Central Station.

1070
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,381
Trade songs with a Kiwi girl, then split for Paris

1071
01:23:56,423 --> 01:23:58,425
Wandered the Champs- Elys's, climbed the Eiffel Tower

1072
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,468
for only seven francs... the ticket machine was broken.

1073
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:01,970
Got the hang of the Metro, took it everywhere.

1074
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:04,514
Ford model party, hooked up with a model named Karina.

1075
01:24:04,514 --> 01:24:07,142
She chugs my cock at the Marriott, which is good.

1076
01:24:07,225 --> 01:24:09,936
Played billiards, went shopping I think she gave me mono.

1077
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,980
Drove a Ferrari that belonged to the Saudi royal family.

1078
01:24:12,063 --> 01:24:14,024
Made out with a Dutch model in front of the Louvre.

1079
01:24:14,065 --> 01:24:15,942
Saw the Arc de Triomphe... almost became road kill.

1080
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,612
"Oakie" invites me to Dublin, I catch an Aer Lingus flight,

1081
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:20,947
stay at the Morrison...Dublin rocks like you can't imagine.

1082
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:23,074
Oakenfold lets me spin some discs with him.

1083
01:24:23,116 --> 01:24:25,160
Irish girls are small as leprechauns.

1084
01:24:25,201 --> 01:24:26,828
I swap hickeys with a drunk woman after groping my abs

1085
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,413
and calling me "Mr. LA." She strips for me

1086
01:24:28,455 --> 01:24:29,789
in the bathroom of the club. Sneak into the Guinness factory

1087
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,916
and steal some stout so good my dick goes hard.

1088
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,960
I fly to Barcelona which is a bust.

1089
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,004
Too many fat American students, too many lame meat markets.

1090
01:24:36,087 --> 01:24:37,547
I dropped acid at the Sagrada Familia,

1091
01:24:37,589 --> 01:24:39,174
which was a trip, to say the least.

1092
01:24:39,257 --> 01:24:40,717
Cruise up the coast to Museo Gala Dali,

1093
01:24:40,759 --> 01:24:42,344
but had no more acid, which sucked.

1094
01:24:42,427 --> 01:24:44,054
Some girl from Canada calls me on my cell,

1095
01:24:44,095 --> 01:24:46,014
so I let her listen to the church bells.

1096
01:24:46,056 --> 01:24:47,682
Canta Cruz is beautiful but there are no girls there,

1097
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:49,267
just old hippies. So I went to Switzerland

1098
01:24:49,309 --> 01:24:51,144
where, ironically, I couldn't find anyone with the time.

1099
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:53,188
Took Glacier Express to Shiltone

1100
01:24:53,229 --> 01:24:54,898
which is beautiful in a way I can't describe.

1101
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,900
EuroPass into Italy, ended up in Venice,

1102
01:24:56,942 --> 01:24:58,151
met a hot girl who looks like Rachel Leigh Cook,

1103
01:24:58,193 --> 01:24:59,402
and speaks better English than I do.

1104
01:24:59,444 --> 01:25:01,488
She's living for a year on only $5.00 a day.

1105
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,907
We gondola around, buy hash. She thinks I'm a capitalist...

1106
01:25:03,949 --> 01:25:06,034
my room costs more for one night than her entire trip.

1107
01:25:06,076 --> 01:25:08,161
She doesn't mind much when I pay the bills. I ditch her

1108
01:25:08,244 --> 01:25:09,746
and hook up with a couple who obviously want a threesome.

1109
01:25:09,829 --> 01:25:12,958
Much tension, but the doofus offers to drive me to Rome,

1110
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,752
an offer I jump at. Traffic's bad, we're stopped for hours.

1111
01:25:15,794 --> 01:25:18,672
The wife's a freak. The guy wigs out on me.

1112
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:21,216
It's like a Polanski film. We stop in Florence,

1113
01:25:21,257 --> 01:25:22,968
where I see some big dome. A bomb goes off

1114
01:25:23,009 --> 01:25:24,803
I lose the weird couple, which is probably for the best.

1115
01:25:24,844 --> 01:25:26,763
Ended up in Rome, which is big and hot and dirty.

1116
01:25:26,763 --> 01:25:28,765
Just like LA, but with ruins. I went to the Vatican,

1117
01:25:28,765 --> 01:25:30,725
which is ridiculously opulent. Stood for two hours

1118
01:25:30,767 --> 01:25:33,436
to get into the Sistine Chapel, which now cleaned, looks fake.

1119
01:25:33,436 --> 01:25:34,980
I meet two underage Italian girls who I try to talk

1120
01:25:35,021 --> 01:25:37,315
into fucking each other while I jack off onto them.

1121
01:25:37,357 --> 01:25:38,608
Bored, I buy them some ice cream instead.

1122
01:25:38,692 --> 01:25:40,151
My hotel has a gym, so I work out.

1123
01:25:40,193 --> 01:25:42,279
I bump into some guy from Camden who says he knows me,

1124
01:25:42,362 --> 01:25:44,281
but I'm sure that he's a fag, so I lose him.

1125
01:25:44,364 --> 01:25:45,782
I try to fart and instead shit my pants.

1126
01:25:45,865 --> 01:25:48,285
In my room I masturbate and have a pain in my groin.

1127
01:25:48,326 --> 01:25:50,453
I dream about a beautiful girl, half in water,

1128
01:25:50,495 --> 01:25:52,414
stretching her lean body. She asks me if I like it.

1129
01:25:52,455 --> 01:25:53,832
I tell her she can clean fish with it.

1130
01:25:53,873 --> 01:25:55,625
I don't know what it means, but I wake well- rested,

1131
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:57,460
masturbate in the shower, and check out.

1132
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:00,463
Make my way back to London, hang out in Piccadilly Circus.

1133
01:26:00,505 --> 01:26:02,841
Swap shirts with some upper- crusty Cambridge chick.

1134
01:26:02,882 --> 01:26:04,884
Hers was an Agnes B.; mine, it cost me my Chanel.

1135
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,928
She acts stuffy and prudish, but is really wild underneath.

1136
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:09,097
She barely looks at my abs, though she wants to.

1137
01:26:09,139 --> 01:26:11,099
The next day I drop acid and get lost in the subway

1138
01:26:11,141 --> 01:26:12,851
for a full day and can't find my way out.

1139
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,769
I meet a cute girl that lets me jack off onto her

1140
01:26:14,811 --> 01:26:16,563
as long as no come gets onto her Paul Smith coat.

1141
01:26:16,646 --> 01:26:18,356
We get stoned while listening to Michael Jackson records.

1142
01:26:18,398 --> 01:26:20,400
The next morning, I wake up talking to myself.

1143
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,402
I had a big bump on my head from flailing in my sleep.

1144
01:26:22,485 --> 01:26:24,362
I get my stuff and barely make my plane

1145
01:26:24,446 --> 01:26:26,364
back to the United States. I no longer know who I am

1146
01:26:26,406 --> 01:26:29,117
and I feel like the ghost of a total stranger.

1147
01:26:33,204 --> 01:26:35,206
So then I ended up back here.

1148
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:39,085
I'm so there when school's out, you don't even know.

1149
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:42,130
No, I do know. And you don't know until you do know.

1150
01:26:42,172 --> 01:26:44,799
And you have to go there to know.

1151
01:26:44,841 --> 01:26:47,177
You still fucking that girl from Hawaii...Page?

1152
01:26:47,218 --> 01:26:49,679
Oh, no, man. I gave up on that shit.

1153
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,433
She had issues. I moved on to this chick named Candice.

1154
01:26:53,516 --> 01:26:55,185
- Yeah? - She's great.

1155
01:26:55,226 --> 01:26:57,020
Did you fuck like a racehorse?

1156
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,606
You know it, brother.

1157
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:03,318
- I met a girl - Did you score some hot poon?

1158
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,570
It's not about that.

1159
01:27:06,738 --> 01:27:08,031
No...

1160
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:12,285
it's about good times and cuddling up.

1161
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:16,164
She's a fag hag, right?

1162
01:27:16,206 --> 01:27:18,750
It's cool because they're fun and they like to dance.

1163
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,503
I tell you, Victor,

1164
01:27:21,544 --> 01:27:23,964
I think I'm in love with this girl.

1165
01:27:23,964 --> 01:27:26,841
She's sweet. She's pure.

1166
01:27:26,883 --> 01:27:29,970
She's innocent.

1167
01:27:30,053 --> 01:27:32,430
She's a virgin.

1168
01:27:33,974 --> 01:27:35,934
Mitch: How young is she?

1169
01:27:35,976 --> 01:27:38,937
"Out of the car seat, onto my meat."

1170
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:41,481
"If she's bleeding, I'm breeding."

1171
01:27:41,523 --> 01:27:45,443
"If there's grass on the field, play ball," you know?

1172
01:27:45,485 --> 01:27:48,488
Mitch: "Old enough to pee, old enough for me."

1173
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,615
Yeah.

1174
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:55,203
- Ow! - Bateman.

1175
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,539
Bateman. Come on. What's up, man?

1176
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,916
Got any "Toot- ankhamen"?

1177
01:28:05,088 --> 01:28:07,215
Sean: How much you want?

1178
01:28:08,258 --> 01:28:09,884
Three grams.

1179
01:28:09,926 --> 01:28:12,012
300. Up front.

1180
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:18,184
I don't fucking trust you.

1181
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,562
Tough shit.

1182
01:28:20,604 --> 01:28:23,440
Take Mitchell with you, then.

1183
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:28,695
We take your car, and I drive.

1184
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:41,082
- Go with him, bitch - Fucker. Ow! Shit!

1185
01:28:41,124 --> 01:28:43,835
I want change. Bring Daddy back change.

1186
01:28:43,877 --> 01:28:46,630
#1000 times...#

1187
01:28:50,216 --> 01:28:53,011
Mitch: Would you keep your eyes on the road?

1188
01:28:55,972 --> 01:28:57,974
Bitchen ride. You pick the color?

1189
01:28:58,016 --> 01:28:59,976
Yeah, and I don't want you to crash it.

1190
01:29:00,018 --> 01:29:02,979
I didn't realize it came in "banana."

1191
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:07,984
- Relax - Mitch: Oh, right. Relax.

1192
01:29:08,026 --> 01:29:10,445
While my car is being used to run a drug deal,

1193
01:29:10,487 --> 01:29:12,822
I'll just sit back and relax.

1194
01:29:12,864 --> 01:29:15,909
I don't give a fuck if we do this deal or not,

1195
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:17,911
but you do. Your girlfriend needs her nose candy.

1196
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:20,121
Without nose candy, she won't fuck you, and you know it.

1197
01:29:20,163 --> 01:29:22,123
I have my terms, if you don't live up to them,

1198
01:29:22,165 --> 01:29:25,001
you get no pussy. So deal with it.

1199
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:37,055
Looks kind of dark. Maybe nobody's home.

1200
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:39,432
Rupert doesn't leave home.

1201
01:29:43,687 --> 01:29:46,731
- I'm gonna wait in the car - It's okay. Rupert's cool.

1202
01:29:46,773 --> 01:29:50,443
- But I don't want to go in - Just come in.

1203
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:53,446
Let's get this over with.

1204
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,918
Who dat?

1205
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:11,172
"Blouse and skirt." Sean, are you dat, man?

1206
01:30:11,214 --> 01:30:13,550
Just the man we're looking to see tonight.

1207
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:16,553
Come in out the cold, mon.

1208
01:30:16,594 --> 01:30:21,808
Sean, Sean, Sean, what, bubba?

1209
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:26,021
You college boys look nice and sweet and sexy.

1210
01:30:26,062 --> 01:30:29,441
Come, mon. Rupert's in the kitchen.

1211
01:30:35,405 --> 01:30:40,243
Rupert, extra chicken in the coop.

1212
01:30:42,621 --> 01:30:45,373
Sean. Who's your friend?

1213
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:48,793
This is Mitch.

1214
01:30:48,835 --> 01:30:50,170
Mitch.

1215
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:53,006
- Hi - You a cop, Mitch?

1216
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:56,551
- No - Does he look like a cop?

1217
01:30:56,593 --> 01:30:59,012
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

1218
01:30:59,054 --> 01:31:01,431
Unless he's got a crack pipe stuck to his lip,

1219
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:03,850
I gotta assume he's fucking "21 Jump Street."

1220
01:31:03,892 --> 01:31:08,021
I'm not "21 Jump Street," whatever that is.

1221
01:31:08,063 --> 01:31:10,690
Where Richard Grieco and Johnny Depp got their start.

1222
01:31:10,732 --> 01:31:13,193
Come on. Where you been?

1223
01:31:13,276 --> 01:31:16,571
You can bet the boy is not a cop. Look upon him.

1224
01:31:16,613 --> 01:31:19,574
Obviously.

1225
01:31:19,616 --> 01:31:23,453
- What can I do you boys for? - Came to pick up some stuff.

1226
01:31:23,453 --> 01:31:25,747
Did you now?

1227
01:31:25,789 --> 01:31:28,083
Where's my money, God damn it, Bateman?

1228
01:31:29,668 --> 01:31:31,670
Don't act crazy, man. Me and my buddy Mitch

1229
01:31:31,711 --> 01:31:34,255
just came by to pick up a couple of grams.

1230
01:31:34,297 --> 01:31:37,133
What the fuck's this?

1231
01:31:38,885 --> 01:31:40,595
$300?

1232
01:31:40,637 --> 01:31:44,933
You owe me $3,000, asshole. Where's my fucking money?

1233
01:31:44,975 --> 01:31:47,227
Hey, wait a minute. Wait.

1234
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:49,020
I'm gonna wait in the car. Excuse me.

1235
01:31:49,104 --> 01:31:50,689
Wait.

1236
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:53,233
Wait for what, asshole? You owe me some fucking money!

1237
01:31:53,275 --> 01:31:55,235
Listen...

1238
01:31:56,278 --> 01:31:58,113
...he's got it.

1239
01:31:58,154 --> 01:32:00,115
I don't know what the hell is going on.

1240
01:32:00,156 --> 01:32:02,367
I just...I came here for some blow, man.

1241
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:04,327
Come on, Mitchell, give Rupert his money.

1242
01:32:04,327 --> 01:32:06,371
What the fuck are you talking about?

1243
01:32:06,413 --> 01:32:09,708
- Give Rupert his money! - I'm gonna go wait in the car.

1244
01:32:09,749 --> 01:32:12,294
Hey, boy! Don't better fuck with us.

1245
01:32:12,335 --> 01:32:14,379
This is absolute shit!

1246
01:32:14,421 --> 01:32:17,424
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1247
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:18,967
Wait! This guy!

1248
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:23,555
- Do you really have it? - I don't...this guy...I...

1249
01:32:23,596 --> 01:32:25,181
You owe me some fucking money!

1250
01:32:25,265 --> 01:32:28,351
- Would you fucking tell him?! - Okay.

1251
01:32:28,435 --> 01:32:30,395
He doesn't have it.

1252
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,483
What do you got for me?

1253
01:32:35,525 --> 01:32:37,736
I know you got something. What do you got for me?

1254
01:32:37,777 --> 01:32:39,738
I have this.

1255
01:32:50,373 --> 01:32:52,500
Sean: Back off! Back the fuck off!

1256
01:33:11,102 --> 01:33:13,063
Let me in! Let me in, I have the keys!

1257
01:33:13,104 --> 01:33:15,440
I have the keys. Fucking let me in.

1258
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:24,157
Fuck!

1259
01:33:27,243 --> 01:33:30,080
Are you fucking crazy?

1260
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,415
Define "crazy."

1261
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,212
Whoo!

1262
01:33:49,891 --> 01:33:52,352
- Wasn't that fun? - Fuck you.

1263
01:33:52,394 --> 01:33:54,354
You're a fucking asshole.

1264
01:33:54,396 --> 01:33:55,772
Why don't you do something about it?

1265
01:33:55,814 --> 01:33:57,899
Fuck you! Get out of my fucking car!

1266
01:33:57,941 --> 01:34:00,944
- Take a swing, man - Give me my keys.

1267
01:34:00,944 --> 01:34:03,071
Come on. I know you want to.

1268
01:34:03,113 --> 01:34:05,115
- Fuck you - Fucking pussy.

1269
01:34:05,115 --> 01:34:06,992
Get out of my fucking car.

1270
01:34:07,033 --> 01:34:11,121
Get out of my fucking car, you piece of shit.

1271
01:34:11,162 --> 01:34:15,458
Get out! Get out of my car!

1272
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:18,086
Fucking asshole!

1273
01:34:23,341 --> 01:34:26,636
Mitchell, you're a pussy.

1274
01:34:26,636 --> 01:34:28,888
Asshole!

1275
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:32,309
Fucking spit in my car.

1276
01:34:32,309 --> 01:34:34,436
Fuck.

1277
01:34:42,652 --> 01:34:47,115
#Hey there, "Mr. Talk Too Much"#

1278
01:34:47,157 --> 01:34:49,784
#What's in store for us now?#

1279
01:34:51,745 --> 01:34:55,665
#I don't know how to speak to you#

1280
01:34:55,707 --> 01:34:58,668
#I don't know how to trust in you...#

1281
01:34:58,668 --> 01:35:00,795
What?!

1282
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:07,719
- I have good news - What?

1283
01:35:07,761 --> 01:35:10,513
Victor's back from Europe.

1284
01:35:14,517 --> 01:35:17,812
Really...?

1285
01:35:18,897 --> 01:35:22,400
Really? Shit.

1286
01:35:22,484 --> 01:35:25,904
Sean: Lauren. Wait.

1287
01:35:25,946 --> 01:35:28,740
Don't. Hey... wait, Lauren.

1288
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,619
- Oh my God - Can't we talk?

1289
01:35:32,661 --> 01:35:34,371
No!

1290
01:35:34,371 --> 01:35:36,122
Lauren.

1291
01:35:36,164 --> 01:35:39,250
Don't walk...hey!

1292
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:42,379
I really did try to kill myself.

1293
01:35:42,462 --> 01:35:45,215
Just before I faked it.

1294
01:35:47,425 --> 01:35:50,804
- Wow. Sean, it's over - No, it's not.

1295
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:53,348
Yeah, it is. I'm in love with somebody else.

1296
01:35:55,183 --> 01:35:57,811
- Who? - My old boyfriend Victor.

1297
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:00,188
And that's none of your fucking business, actually.

1298
01:36:01,898 --> 01:36:05,318
- Fucking Victor? - Yeah.

1299
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:12,742
Then why the fuck are you writing me letters?

1300
01:36:14,577 --> 01:36:16,204
Wow.

1301
01:36:18,331 --> 01:36:22,794
Deal with it, Sean. It's over. Rock and roll.

1302
01:36:24,504 --> 01:36:26,464
Lauren, I want to know you.

1303
01:36:28,591 --> 01:36:32,762
What does that mean, "know me"? "Know me."

1304
01:36:32,804 --> 01:36:35,098
Nobody knows anyone else, ever!

1305
01:36:35,098 --> 01:36:38,601
You will never, ever know me.

1306
01:37:22,938 --> 01:37:25,398
Holy shit.

1307
01:37:33,531 --> 01:37:35,492
Ahem...

1308
01:37:38,119 --> 01:37:42,457
You do not know what a drag it is to see you right now.

1309
01:37:48,004 --> 01:37:49,631
Look...

1310
01:37:49,673 --> 01:37:51,633
yeah...

1311
01:37:53,176 --> 01:37:56,846
You smell really good

1312
01:37:56,888 --> 01:37:59,307
but I don't know who you are.

1313
01:37:59,349 --> 01:38:01,893
Victor, shut up. It's me.

1314
01:38:01,977 --> 01:38:06,356
Oh, of course. How are... you?

1315
01:38:06,356 --> 01:38:09,818
How long have you been here? Why haven't you called?

1316
01:38:13,321 --> 01:38:15,115
I...

1317
01:38:15,156 --> 01:38:17,659
This is embarrassing. I'm sorry...

1318
01:38:17,701 --> 01:38:19,202
It's all right.

1319
01:38:19,202 --> 01:38:23,164
I don't have the slightest idea who you are right now.

1320
01:38:23,206 --> 01:38:27,043
Really, it's... it's totally blank.

1321
01:38:29,462 --> 01:38:34,217
- Yeah, it is - Should I know you?

1322
01:38:41,057 --> 01:38:44,602
It's great seeing you, really.

1323
01:39:23,058 --> 01:39:24,934
Hey, man.

1324
01:39:32,317 --> 01:39:34,903
Looks like it's gonna be a cold one.

1325
01:39:40,575 --> 01:39:42,535
You know...

1326
01:39:42,577 --> 01:39:46,456
I find myself talking to you when you're not even around...

1327
01:39:46,498 --> 01:39:49,125
just carrying on conversations.

1328
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:51,920
I wish you wouldn't tell me shit like that.

1329
01:39:51,962 --> 01:39:53,797
But, Sean, I don't...

1330
01:39:53,797 --> 01:39:56,549
You've got the wrong idea. I don't want to be with you.

1331
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:03,264
What do you mean? No, I just...

1332
01:40:03,306 --> 01:40:08,019
want to know you. Just want to know who you are.

1333
01:40:08,103 --> 01:40:10,563
Sean: No one will ever know anyone.

1334
01:40:11,898 --> 01:40:14,359
You're not ever gonna know me.

1335
01:40:14,359 --> 01:40:18,280
What the hell does that mean?

1336
01:40:18,321 --> 01:40:20,782
It means, Paul,

1337
01:40:20,824 --> 01:40:25,161
you're not ever gonna know me.

1338
01:40:25,203 --> 01:40:28,957
Figure it out. Deal with it.

1339
01:40:31,376 --> 01:40:33,920
Fuck you, Bateman.

1340
01:40:35,547 --> 01:40:38,091
Fuck you, Bateman!

1341
01:40:40,468 --> 01:40:42,679
Fuck you!

1342
01:40:49,436 --> 01:40:52,522
Fuck... you!

1343
01:41:44,491 --> 01:41:47,452
Welcome to "Buford T. Pusser County."

1344
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:57,128
You wanna fuck with me? You wanna fuck with me?

1345
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:59,881
I'll show you fucking!

1346
01:42:01,716 --> 01:42:04,219
You hear what Guest said, motherfucker?

1347
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,471
I have your money, my brother wired it into my account.

1348
01:42:06,513 --> 01:42:10,350
You got the money? It was that easy, motherfucker?

1349
01:42:10,392 --> 01:42:12,519
Fuck you, motherfucker.

1350
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,562
How goddamn funny you think this is?

1351
01:44:11,096 --> 01:44:13,515
How are you, Miss Hynde?

1352
01:44:14,641 --> 01:44:17,310
Okay.

1353
01:44:17,352 --> 01:44:19,646
How have you been...

1354
01:44:19,688 --> 01:44:21,273
Mr. Denton?

1355
01:44:21,314 --> 01:44:23,733
Okay.

1356
01:44:49,926 --> 01:44:52,595
He really likes you.

1357
01:44:52,637 --> 01:44:55,348
That's great.

1358
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:01,563
Listen...were you putting notes in his box?

1359
01:45:01,605 --> 01:45:03,565
Whose box?

1360
01:45:05,859 --> 01:45:09,404
I thought you were putting notes in his box.

1361
01:45:09,446 --> 01:45:12,907
Purple ones? Love letters?

1362
01:45:12,949 --> 01:45:16,620
No, I didn't put notes into anybody's box.

1363
01:45:16,661 --> 01:45:19,914
You didn't?

1364
01:45:19,956 --> 01:45:22,542
Wrong person.

1365
01:45:22,584 --> 01:45:24,753
Wasn't me.

1366
01:45:27,797 --> 01:45:31,926
- Then there's someone else - Doesn't matter anyway.

1367
01:45:31,968 --> 01:45:34,638
Not to people like him.

1368
01:45:41,102 --> 01:45:44,189
Not to people like us.

1369
01:46:20,016 --> 01:46:23,436
Sean: I started driving faster as I left the college behind.

1370
01:46:25,605 --> 01:46:28,400
Someplace unoccupied, I hoped.

1371
01:46:28,441 --> 01:46:30,443
At first I thought there were things about her

1372
01:46:30,485 --> 01:46:34,489
that I would never forget, but in the end,

1373
01:46:34,531 --> 01:46:36,866
all I could think about was...
