1
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,210
My dad always told
me stories about her-

2
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,160
How she was this great oceanographer.

3
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,420
Stories about the baby they had...

4
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,730
and how my mom just
had to name her... Nim.

5
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,700
She invented that name.

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,330
At least,that's how
my dad tells the story.

7
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,160
That's all my mother is to me now
- just these stories.

8
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,120
But they're really some amazing stories.

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,110
Like the one he calls ''The
Oceanographer and the Great Blue Whale. ''

10
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,970
Once upon a time,the oceanographer
went out on the wide-open sea...

11
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,360
to find out what was in the
stomach of the great blue whale.

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
As my mother was staring
into the mouth of the whale...

13
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,220
a mysterious ship came out of nowhere.

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,540
It was called The Buccaneer Ship.

15
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,400
It got much too close,and
it frightened the whale.

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,590
And the oceanographer was
swallowed and taken by the sea.

17
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,920
Dad felt that we should sail the
ocean and look for that blue whale-

18
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,900
that,someday,that whale
would bring her back to us.

19
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,340
I think he just missed her.

20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,720
We both did.

21
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,180
By my fourth birthday,we had
sailed around the globe... twice-

22
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,380
From the Cape of Good Hope
to the tip of Ratagonia...

23
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,180
from Singapore to the Cook Islands.

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,800
Then one day,we found it-

25
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,200
our home.

26
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,730
This is my island.

27
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,480
Not a bad place to grow up,huh?

28
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,020
See,I don't have to go to school.

29
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,430
- I'm home-schooled.
- Hey,Selkie!

30
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,630
Watch out! Move it!

31
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,540
Or,technically,island-schooled.

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,180
Sorry!

33
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,370
Everything I know about the
world I learned from my friends.

34
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,180
Galileo!

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,510
Like,do you know that two objects...

36
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,710
no matter how big they are,will
fall at exactly the same speed?

37
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,820
Galileo proved it. He's my pelican.

38
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,670
Selkie,my sea lion,taught
me how to swim.

39
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,450
- So I returned the favor by teaching her soccer.
-

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,170
She's an excellent midfelder.

41
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,460
Oh,and I'll bet you didn't know that sea
turtles and certain species oflizards...

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,010
really get on each other's nerves.

43
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,570
Anything else I need to
know about the world...

44
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,810
I just open one of the
books my dad brought for me.

45
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,220
With a little imagination,I
can go anywhere. -

46
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,530
All in all,not a bad life.

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,040
For dinner,I throw together
some vegetables from our garden.

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,600
And for a little extra flavor,I toss
in some freshly dug-up mealworms.

49
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,160
Mmm. My dad's favorite.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,690
Incredible day,Nim.
A new species,I think.

51
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,790
Well,if its new,remember
what youre naming it.

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,560
''Protozoa Nim. I havent forgotten.

53
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,720
See,my dad's a marine biologist.

54
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,220
He's obsessed with nanoplankton,the
tiniest little particles in the ocean.

55
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,800
They're not really my
thing,but to each his own,right?

56
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,070
Did you know there are millions of
picoplankton in a milliliter of water?

57
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,840
Protozoa Nim could be here right now.

58
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,440
What? Wha-

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,580
- Hey,Lizard!
- Hes not ''Lizard. His name is Fred.

60
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,460
For a guy who loves nature,you'd
think he'd be more into animals.

61
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,830
When they have more than one
cell,Jack sort ofloses interest.

62
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,360
Scientists write to him from all over the
world with questions about all sorts of things.

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,960
He even writes articles sometimes...

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,100
like this great one
for National Geographic.

65
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,040
- Whats the reading?
- Thirty-seven knots!

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,530
Hey,I'm not saying a scientist's
life is for everyone...

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
but it is the life for us.

68
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,670
Every few months,the supply ship
comes,bringing us things that we need.

69
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,940
New books and paper,nails and cloth-

70
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,880
All the things we can't
make for ourselves.

71
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,740
We sail out into the
open water to meet it.

72
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,790
No one,not even the
supply ship's captain...

73
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,320
has ever seen how amazing
our little island really is.

74
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,280
We take care of our island,Nim,our
islands gonna take care of us.

75
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,290
And that's the way we wanna keep it-

76
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,560
our own perfect,secret world.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,390
-  Are ya ready?
-  I'm ready.

78
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,310
Ah,bounty.

79
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,150
Look at this
- Heirloom tomato seeds.

80
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,570
- Do you remember those freckled ones we were reading about?
- Check it out!

81
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,460
The new Alex Rover!
My Arabian Adventure.

82
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,750
What do you think happens in Arabia?

83
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,580
Wait until after dinner,Nim.

84
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,210
No,Im just gonna start it.

85
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,960
''It's been my curse my entire life.

86
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,140
''I do not go looking for
trouble,but somehow it finds me.

87
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,680
The question wasn't,am I going to die?

88
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,310
The question was,how am I going to die?

89
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,900
Will it be by my captors'guns,or
will it be death by thirst?

90
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,360
Must be the hero of my own life story.

91
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,580
Must be the hero of my own life story.

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,820
Must be the hero of my own life story.

93
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,470
Where are you taking me?

94
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,550
A special hole,just for you,Alex Rover.

95
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,780
Ever heard of the Rit of Spiders?

96
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,480
''Pit of Spiders,huh?

97
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,690
Well,I guess that answers
the ''how will I die question.

98
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,800
No,no,no,no! Wait,wait,wait,stop!

99
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,510
Wherere you going?

100
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,350
Oh,death by thirst
makes a late comeback.

101
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,820
How did Alex Rover get to be Alex Rover?

102
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,360
- Well,lets see.
- Was he born with all that courage?

103
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,430
''Was he born with all that courage?

104
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,270
The thing about courage is...

105
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,680
its somethin that we have to
learn and relearn our whole lives.

106
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,220
You know,its not just in you.

107
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,690
Its in every choice we
make,each and every day.

108
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,690
- Where do you think Alex Rover is at this very minute?
- Oh,well,I dont know.

109
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,720
Maybe hes chained up in a sarcophagus
20,000 fathoms under the sea.

110
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,230
Or in some pit of spiders...

111
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,570
trapped without the
antidote for their poison.

112
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,310
Yeah,pit of spiders. I like that.

113
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,410
Okay. Time to get some rest.

114
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,040
Sleep tight,now,okay?

115
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,220
And no dreaming about spiders.

116
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,560
Spider! Spider!

117
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,500
Get away from me.

118
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,140
All right. These all go back here.

119
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,880
Straight. Right angles.

120
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,420
Is-Is this the,uh,Telegraph
Hill Pharmacy?

121
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,560
Yes,I need a delivery,please.

122
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,260
Uh,Purell.

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,590
Well,h-how many bottles do you have?

124
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,980
Oh. Uh,very good. All of them.

125
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,260
Yeah. Send em all.

126
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,970
Uh,who is it?

127
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,220
- Telegraph Hill Pharmacy.
- Uh,just leave it there,please.

128
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,250
Just leave it here? In the rain?

129
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,770
Yeah,go ahead. I-I put it on my
MasterCard. I left you a very nice tip.

130
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,690
- Uh,make sure you get it.
- Okay.

131
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,510
Alexandra,it's Buffy,your
favorite editor.

132
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,830
I know you're there,and I know
you're not going to pick up.

133
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,710
I just worry about you,darling...

134
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,590
sitting at your computer,living
on a diet of only Rrogresso soup.

135
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,580
- How can you eat that every day?
- Buffy.

136
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,850
So,how is the new Alex Rover coming?

137
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,380
Wasn't I supposed to read
something two weeks ago?

138
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,630
No pressure,no pressure,no pressure.

139
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,360
See,what you don't know about me
is that where there's an Alex Rover-

140
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,710
theres a way!

141
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,220
I have a certain knack for getting out of
predicaments far worse than this one,you know.

142
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,160
Eh. Excuse me?

143
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,330
No,hold on. No. Im supposed
to get outta this,you know.

144
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,840
Alexandra!

145
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,330
Why cant I get this?

146
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,760
No pressure,no pressure,no pressure.

147
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,820
Volcanic sacrifice. What was I thinking?

148
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,220
Volcano,volcano.

149
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,200
''Living in the Shadow
of a Volcano. ''Hmm.

150
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,860
Well,thats just crazy. I
mean,why would anyone do that?

151
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,380
Perfect.

152
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,880
- What you doin,Jack?
- Ah,there you areI

153
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,340
Currents shifted,Nim. Zanders Atoll
is gonna be just five feet underwater.

154
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,010
Zander's Atoll? But it's almost dinnerI

155
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,480
Hey,we might not see algae
growth like this for years.

156
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,080
More plankton?

157
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,290
This is the trip we find Protozoa Nim.

158
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,450
I swear it. I can feel it in my bones.

159
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,470
But Chiccas eggs are about
to hatch. I need to be here.

160
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,830
No negotiating. I mean,this is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.Come on!

161
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,380
Yeah,you said that last week
about the southern borealis.

162
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,610
- Two nights,Nim.
- No! Chicca only saved one last year,Jack.

163
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,880
One little turtle. I want to stay.

164
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,450
We can talk on the satellite phone.

165
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,030
Nim,please.

166
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,880
Im not a little girl anymore.

167
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,370
You got so much of your
mom in you,you know that?

168
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,900
- Thats a good thing,right?
- Yeah,good.Sure.

169
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,100
Unfortunately,I could never
win a fight with her either.

170
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,200
Okay,it's only four hours till low tide.

171
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,950
Oh! Hey,could you grab my
collection jars and my wet suit?

172
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,290
I already packed them for youI

173
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,910
Any e-mails show up,tell em Im on expedition.
Ill get to their questions on Thursday.

174
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,340
Hey,Lizard,get off of that.

175
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,700
He's not ''Lizard. '' His name is Fred.

176
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,190
Unless it's,like,a
ridiculously obvious e-mail.

177
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,450
- Then I can help em,right?
- Id rather you just said Thursday.

178
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,840
Nim,are you sure youre okay with this?

179
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,500
Come on. Youve left me alone before.

180
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,840
Well,yeah. One night. But never for two.

181
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,580
Well,look,Ive got Selkie and Fred and
Galileo and the new Alex Rover book.

182
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,170
- Ill be excellent.
- All right,all right.

183
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,090
- You just come back with Protozoa Nim!
- I will!

184
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,600
Ill see ya Thursday! Love you!

185
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,740
Love you too!

186
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,570
Ill radio you tonight!

187
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,940
No parties while Im gone!

188
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,040
#Baby,baby please let me hold him #

189
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,260
#I wanna make him stay up all night #

190
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,510
#Sister,Sister He's just a plaything #

191
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,650
# We wanna make him stay up all night #

192
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,330
#Here we go #

193
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,150
#See him drink from a bottle #

194
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,760
#See him eat from a plate ##

195
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,680
Ooh,two new e-mails. Aren't we popular?

196
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,790
Hey,Freddie.Hows it goin?

197
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,080
''DearJack Rusoe,I need a bit
of help on my newest adventure.

198
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,510
Might you be able to answer a
few questions for me? Alex Rover.

199
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,670
Alex Rover?Alex Rover
is writing to my dad?

200
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,240
Do you think its the Alex Rover?

201
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,330
Its him! Its him! Its really him!

202
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,520
Dear Alex Rover,Im sureJack would love
to help you with your newest adventure.

203
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,820
Hes a great fan of yours. We both are.

204
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,680
From... Nim.

205
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,750
''Dear Alex Rover...

206
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,600
''I'm sureJack would love to help
you with your newest adventure.

''He'll be back on Thursday. He's
a great fan of yours. We both are.

208
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,500
From Nim.

209
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,400
Nim. Hmm,what an unusual name.

210
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,920
Dear Nim,are you Jack's
research associate?

211
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,360
Jack wrote of a volcano where you live.

212
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,440
Are you familiar with
it? Sincerely,Alex Rover.

213
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,150
Send.

214
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,710
- What are you doing,Alexandra?
- Um,research.

215
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,180
Go. Go. Go away. Leave me alone.

216
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,580
You dont mean that. You love me.

217
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,590
And what makes you so sure of that,huh?

218
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,100
Because the whole
world loves Alex Rover.

219
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,000
Really? I know. ''Translated
into 21 different languages.

220
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,070
No pressure,no pressure,no pressure.

221
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,060
Youve been writing chapter
eight for three months now.

222
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,550
So either sacrifice me to the damn
volcano or let me find my escape already.

223
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,450
- Hey! Its time to finish the book.
- Shh!Im thinking.

224
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,640
Yeah. Youre thinking. Youre thinking.

225
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,610
Thats the problem. Youve gotta get
outta your head and into your body.

226
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,670
Hey,thats it. Kinka.

227
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,920
Kinka?

228
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,950
Kinka!

229
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,190
Kinka!

230
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,220
Kinka!

231
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,250
Yeah!

232
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,680
It was incredible,Jack.

233
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,160
Chicca's babies were born
tonight,just like I said.

234
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,530
-  That's excellent.
-  And the mole crabs were crazy hungry.

235
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,150
It was so important that I
stayed. I saved all six turtles.

236
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,930
Well,they're lucky you were
there. I'm proud of you,honey.

237
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,810
- Hows Zanders Atoll? - Oh,I
wish you could see this,Nim. Its-

238
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,500
I mean,its more incredible
than the Milky Way.

239
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,960
Next time theres no negotiating,okay?

240
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,220
Have you found my nanoplankton yet?

241
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,580
Mmm. I have a pretty
good feeling about it.

242
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,040
Now,go to sleep,Nim. No more
reading. Well talk in the morning.

243
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,330
How did you know I was reading?

244
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,300
Oh,I know you pretty well.

245
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,790
Good night,Nim. Sleep tight.

246
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,040
Its just magnificent.

247
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,260
No!

248
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,060
Jack? Daddy?

249
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,200
Oh,no.

250
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,280
Freddie!

251
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,250
Its a mess in here,eh,Selk?

252
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,130
No power. This rots.

253
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,020
Jack?

254
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:57,510
Can you hear me?
Jack... Michael... Rusoe?

255
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,460
Daddy,can you hear me?

256
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,700
Jack?

257
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,780
Come in,DaddyI

258
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,860
Jack? Daddy?

259
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,250
Rrotozoa Nim.

260
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,000
Leak. Leak is not good.

261
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,040
Nobody likes a leak.

262
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,560
Middle of nowhere.

263
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,350
No mast. No satellite.

264
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,020
Sinking ship.

265
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,490
How do I get back to Nim?

266
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,370
Hes not even due back
till tomorrow,right,Fred?

267
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,480
Nothin to worry about.

268
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,390
Gotta get food. I gotta get strength.

269
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,800
I gotta get back to Nim.

270
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,710
Thats my fish! I saw it first!

271
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,550
What? Huh? Who are you?

272
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,260
Do I know you? You're
one of Nim's friends?

273
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,930
I must be gettin
sunstroke. Talkin to a bird.

274
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,070
You just come back with Rrotozoa NimI

275
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,800

276
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,110

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,010
I'll radio you tonightI

278
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,430
Its a mess in here,eh,Selk?

279
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,390
Alex Rover? Hes writing to us again?

280
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,880
''Dear Nim,are you
Jack's research associate?

281
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,840
''Rerhaps you can help me. I'm up
against a very serious deadline.

282
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,560
''Jack wrote of a volcano where
you live. Are you familiar with it?

283
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,580
Sincerely,Alex Rover. ''

284
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,270
''Dear Alex Rover,we do have a volcano
-''

285
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,680
Only we call it Fire Mountain.

286
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,700
It hasnt exploded in years,but when it
did,the sky went completely white with ash.

287
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,380
Thats excellent. ''Sky white
with ash. I like that image.

288
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,680
All right. Dear Nim,can one
really see bubbling lava...

289
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,080
inside the mouth of a volcano?

290
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,330
Send. All right.I cant wait for that.

291
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,440
Oh,no. Mailman. Oh,no. Hey!

292
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,140
Uh- Uh- Excuse me! Can you
just leave it on the porch?

293
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,040
Can you just leave it under the door?

294
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,120
Ouch.

295
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,850
Dear Alex Rover...

296
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,930
I'm not sure what it looks like inside
a volcano,but I'll let you know soon.

297
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,970
Sincerely,Nim,Jack's research associate.

298
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,800
Oh,so much mail.

299
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,330
I just open the door.
Open the door,no big deal.

300
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,710
Just get the mail,get the mail.

301
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,670
Okay,Fred. No big deal. Let's do this.

302
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,240
I can do it. I can do it.

303
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,270
Everyone turns knobs.
You can do it. Come on.

304
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,190
Come on.Just a little farther.

305
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,640
Okay,grab it. One,two,three.

306
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,510
Who needs mail?

307
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,700
I can get it tomorrow.

308
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,590
Hmm,interesting.

309
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,550
Not really lava as
much as dry,craggy rock.

310
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,480
I cant wait to tell Alex Rover.

311
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,130
Galileo,we were worried
about you! Whered you go?

312
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,440
Were just doing some
research for Alex Rove-

313
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,960
Whats that? Hold on,Fred!

314
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,140
Oh,come on. Come on,open up!

315
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,870
Open! Unclip,unclip!

316
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,850
Come on!

317
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,140
Fred,are you okay?

318
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,410
Lets,um
- Lets not tellJack we came here,okay?

319
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,610
''Dear Alex Rover,my volcano
expedition didn't go well at all.

320
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:26,250
I fell down the face of the mountain
and got a nasty five-inch cut on my leg.

321
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,870
Oh,my. All because of me.

322
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,780
''It's very swollen and
now pus is coming out.

323
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,070
P.S. How would you handle a
fve-inch gash with pus coming out?''

324
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,390
What would I do?

325
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,920
Dear Nim,the most
important thing for a cut...

326
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,510
is to make sure that
it's kept clean and dry.

327
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,360
In the Cook Islands,they use
the stem of a Simarouba plant...

328
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,330
- to keep out infection.
- Hmm. Simarouba.

329
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,990
P.S. Are you all right,Nim?

330
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,980
''Dear Alex,regarding your
question 'Am I all right?'

331
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,170
''I will be when my dad gets back.

332
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:15,920
''But its awfully good
talking to a real live hero.

333
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,540
Nim.

334
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,760
W-Wait a minute.
''When my dad gets back?

335
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,140
Oh,my God.

336
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,590
Who are you,Nim? How old are you?

337
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,660
Are you all alone,wherever you are?

338
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,780
What is it? What does it want out there?

339
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,880
It's coming so fast.

340
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,910
''Buccaneer? Buccaneer ship?

341
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,670
''The Oceanographer and
the Great Blue Whale. ''

342
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,270
Oh,no.

343
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,350
I think were being invaded.

344
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,160
Simply heavenly. Bloody paradise.

345
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,380
Not on any map,either.

346
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,540
Captain,come and take a look at this.

347
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:12,630
Oh,yes. This is my
bowl of rice,all right.

348
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,000
Thisll do quite nicely.

349
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,200
Look at him.

350
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,950
Pretty little porpoise.

351
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,850
Nature in all its glorious splendor.

352
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,530
Put the barbies over there.

353
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,460
Well fill the sand with beach chairs...

354
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,110
and we sell pi¨¾a coladas
for 1 0 bucks a pop.

355
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,270
Shh,Freddie.

356
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,010
You promised everyone a private island,Captain,and
that's exactly what they're getting.

357
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,030
Corporates are gonna love it. Thisll
be their own private Buccaneer paradise.

358
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,980
- ''Buccaneer paradise?
-  Excellent.

359
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,370
We come back in two days.

360
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,070
How great would a
hotel look right there?

361
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,510
Strip all the trees back. Rerfect.

362
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,900
Back in two days.

363
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,350
Jack?

364
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,140
Jack,come in.

365
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,230
Daddy!

366
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,870
Daddy,where are you?

367
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,030
I need you.

368
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:40,240
''Who are you,Nim? How old are you?

369
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,320
Are you all alone wherever you are?

370
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,930
''Yes. Im all alone. Im
1 1,and my fathers gone.

371
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,030
''Hes lost at sea.

372
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,590
''And my leg is swollen and bleeding.

373
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,100
And the Buccaneers are coming
to take over the island. Nim.

374
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,180
What can I possibly do,Nim?

375
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,950
What can I possibly do,Nim?

376
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,520
Come.

377
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,350
Come?

378
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,230
I cant do this all by myself.

379
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,850
I cant be the hero of my own story.

380
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,100
I need you,Alex Rover.

381
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,000
Please. Help me.

382
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,150
Help me,please.

383
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,810
Im sorry.

384
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,840
I wish I could come,but Im
a borderline agoraphobic.

385
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,240
Borderline? Is that
what youre callin it?

386
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,230
Youre not actually
gonna send that,are you?

387
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,870
Im sorry.

388
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:11,230
I wish I could come,but
Im borderline agoraphobic.

389
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,670
I havent even left my
apartment in 1 6 weeks.

390
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,430
What are you talking about?

391
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,690
Youre one of the greatest
adventurers who ever lived!

392
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,690
Youre Alex Rover!

393
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,930
But Im not that Alex Rover.

394
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,160
Yeah,youre definitely not.

395
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,270
9 1 1. What is your emergency?

396
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,070
Uh,me? Thats really,really
not important.

397
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,270
Whats important is that
theres a little girl...

398
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,370
and shes all alone somewhere deep
in the middle of the South Pacific...

399
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,690
and,well,she-she-shes
badly injured herself...

400
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,170
and I feel
- I feel quite responsible for this.

401
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,870
Excuse me. Did you say ''South Pacific?

402
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,930
Yes,yes,I did.

403
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,870
Im sorry. We serve only the
greater San Francisco Bay area.

404

-  Suva Department of Interior.
- Suva,Fiji Islands.

405
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,960
- Fiji,yeah.
- Uh,theres a little girl on a remote island...

406
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:11,530
- somewhere near you,I think.
- There are 331 islands comprise Fiji,maam.

407
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,510
''Nim,where are you exactly?''

408
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,330
Dear Alex Rover...

409
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,980
our island is 20 degrees
south,1 62 degrees west...

410
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,440
in the south Asiatic Sea.

411
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,390
- Don't share my location- - ''Dont
share my location with anyone else.

412

''My dad would be devastated if the
world discovered our secret home.

413
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,970
But Im scared to be all alone. Nim.

414
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,240
- Lets do it.
- Do what?

415
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,670
Go.

416
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,020
Twenty degrees south,1 62 degrees west.

417
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,750
I cant even leave my apartment. I cant-
I-I cant go to the south Asiatic Sea!

418
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,380
Its just along the
road. Alex,she needs you.

419
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,370
I dont even know her.

420
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,830
What dont you know?
That shes a little girl?

421
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,960
That shes alone on an island,and
that shes askin for your help.

422
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,010
Be the hero of your own life story.

423
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,420
Dont throw that line at
me. I wrote that line.

424
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,690
Oh,I know. Why dont you
follow it for a change then?

425
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,070
Come on. Lets get out
of this damned apartment.

426
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,830
Lets go on an adventure!
Come on a road trip with me.

427
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:31,410
Hey,you never know.
You might even enjoy it.

428
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,150
I need you,Alex Rover.

429
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:48,270
Oh,I really am losing my mind.

430
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,940
Dear Nim. After some
serious soul-searching...

431
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,240
I've decided to travel to 20
degrees south,1 62 degrees west.

432
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,430
Sadly,the only flight I could get
leaves San Francisco at midnight...

433
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,900
and makes some unusual connections.

434
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:11,140
I cannot say for sure when I'm arriving,but
please know that I am on my way.

435
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,750
If for some reason I never arrive,it
probably means... I'm lost at sea.

436
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,300
Sincerely,Alex Rover.

437
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,310
Alex Rover is coming?

438
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,180
Selkie,he's comingI He's on his wayI

439
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,030
I cant do it. I cant go.

440
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,510
Frankly,Im amazed you made it this far.

441
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,240
Yeah,probably best that you dont go.

442
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,000
I mean,after all-

443
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,380
It was me she asked
for,wasnt it? Not you.

444
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,100
But,unfortunately,youre not real.

445
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,520
I am to you.

446
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,280
Come on.

447
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,620
- Open the door,Alexandra.
- You cant make me.

448
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,190
No,youre right. I cant.

449
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,790
You have to do it for yourself.

450
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,500
Go on.

451
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,660
Now,turn the knob.

452
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,520
Yeah. You can do it.

453
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,110
Yes! Whoo!

454
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,810
Lets go save that little girl.

455
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,660
Take my hand,Alexandra.

456
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,400
No.

457
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,000
- Touch the world.
- I dont wanna touch the world.

458
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,480
I-Its not sanitary.

459
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,720
- Come on!
- Stop pulling!

460
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,820
Quit itI

461
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,280
-  Quit it!
- What the-

462
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,570
What are you afraid of?

463
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,830
Everything!

464
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,190

465
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,020
Yeah. Im fine. Im just-

466
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,390
Im thrilled to be
getting some fresh air.

467
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,600
Can-Can-Can you just
hold-hold- hold on?

468
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,600
Im just a little
- Im a little prone to motion sickness.

469
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,680
Were not movin yet.

470
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:09,390
Yeah,well,it-its really the- Its really
the idea of motion that sickens me.

471
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,460
This is what we gotta do,Freddie.

472
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,770
We have to keep em in the bay.
Now,Alex Rovers on his way.

473
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,160
We've just gotta hold
them off our beach.

474
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,520
Its pure and simple. Lines of
defense,like the Peloponnesians.

475
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,250
Theyre ancient Greek warriors.

476
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,060
Its all there in the World Book.

477
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,470
Galileo,youre just in time!

478
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,340
We need you. We're being invaded.

479
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,230
Now it's all hands on deck.
Everybody's helping out.

480
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,460
Wait,wait. Galileo.

481
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,770
Galileo,no! What are you doing?
Galileo,come back!I need those!

482
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,930
Those were my tools!

483
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,050
Shoes,maam.

484
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,070
Shoes? Thats disgusting.

485
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,570
Excuse me,maam.

486
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,100
Turn around,please.

487
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,790
We got a hot one! Bag check!

488
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,300
Whats this?

489
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,520
I-I-Its
for my soup.

490
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,130
Not allowed.

491
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,210
How am I supposed to
open it? With my teeth?

492
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,390
- What are these? -
Oh,thats-thats hand sanitizer.

493
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,640
- Its-Its an excellent,excellent
product. - Not allowed.

494
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,250
- You should use this in your line of work.
- Im sorry.

495
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,710
- No liquids greater than
three ounces allowed. - B-But I-

496
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
Next!

497
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
Oh,no! No! No!

498
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,750
Dont! Dont die on me!

499
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,500
Oh,shoot.

500
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,310
My tool belt.

501
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,950
Galileo?

502
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,590
Galileo. Thank you.

503
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,730
Theres hope forJack
yet,you lousy sharks!

504
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:01,560
Oh,my God,it's so hot in
here. It's like a Turkish bath.

505
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,090
Are you finding it
excessively hot in here?

506
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:08,060
I already answered you that,miss.
Its very comfortable to me.

507
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,730
Oh. Excuse me. Um,just-just-
Last time,I promise.

508
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,010
What is it now,maam?

509
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,890
Do you happen to have any way
of heating up Progresso soup?

510
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,350
You know,Im not much
of a traveler,but,uh-

511
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,300
They confiscated my
opener at the airport.

512
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,200
My arm!

513
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,750
- Oh,Im sorry.
- Its fine. Its just minor turbulence,okay?

514
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,510
- Its fine.
- Minor turbulence. Thats right.

515
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,910
Uh,you know what? I-Im just
gonna- Just one second. Im gonna-

516
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:37,470
But- I- Im just
gonna do this one-

517
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,950
I-If you dont mind,Ill
just scoot right by you.

518
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,250
Scuse me.

519
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,750
Oh,airplanes.

520
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,150
Theres nothing good about
airplanes,except the peanuts.

521
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,670
Am I allergic to peanuts?

522
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,110
What was I possibly thinking?

523
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,170
You were thinking,''Wanderlust,adventure,frequent
flier miles. ''

524
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,460
Can I just have a little
privacy in the bathroom?

525
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,840
I mean,I mean,please. Is nothing sacred?

526
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,120
- What are these?
- Motion sickness pills.

527
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,600
Dont they make you drowsy?

528
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,720
Drowsy.

529
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,480
Miss Rover? Miss Rover? Miss Rover?

530
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,450
- Wha- - Were here.
Were in Borneo.

531
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,610
Oh,but I dont wanna be in
Borneo. I wanna be in Rarotonga.

532
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:44,920
Well,your connecting flight to
Rarotonga leaves from Gate F-7 1 in-

533
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,900
- in 1 2 minutes.
-  Okay.

534
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,390
- Do you want a hand or anything?
- No. Im...good.

535
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,110
Okay.

536
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,630
- Scuse me. Sorry.
- Hey!

537
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,620
Oh! Oh! Oh! Im so sorry. Im so sorry.

538
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,420
I-I didnt mean to. I gotta go,though.

539
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,800
No,no,wait. Wait,how-

540
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,270
I think theres been
some mistake. Im- Um-

541
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,630
I-Im supposed to be on
the plane to Rarotonga.

542
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,280
Oh,yes. No mistake.

543
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,620
Well-Well- No.
No,no,no,no,no,no.

544
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,480
Expedia specifically said to me that I
would be on the big plane to Rarotonga.

545
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,240
Oh,this is the big plane to Rarotonga.

546
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,430
Oh,this is the big
plane to Rarotonga. Oh.

547
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,400
Isnt that funny? Alex Rover.

548
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,230
Same name as great adventure hero.

549
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,720
Yes. Its hilarious.

550
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,980
Okay. First,the most important thing
is that they dont know were here.

551
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,920
Kill that fre. We'll cover the path too.

552
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,160
We have to make this
place seem horrible...

553
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,820
the last place anybody would wanna be.

554
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:03,490
When Jack gets back,Im telling
him I protected this island.

555
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,440
We can take em,Selk. We have no choice.

556
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,310
No fire tonight,guys.

557
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,930
No fire and no light.

558
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,470
Nobody can know that were here.

559
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:26,940
Come on,guys. Nobodys out there.

560
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:30,190
Well just all close our eyes.

561
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,100
Oh,please. Please dont take me now.

562
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,490
I promise that if I survive this,I
will never leave the house again.

563
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:52,050
I promise I will only listen
to my deepest fears and doubts.

564
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,460
Orion is there,and-and this is April.

565
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:04,400
Then I must be nine degrees north of-

566
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,930
Theres a shipping lane through-

567
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,090
What? Am I too far north?

568
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,210
Yeah,maybe youre right.

569
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,010
I mean,you know your stars,Galileo.

570
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,080
Emily?

571
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,840
Is it you?

572
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:39,080
I will get back to her,Emily! I
- I swear it!

573
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,610
I will take care of Nim!

574
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,470
Emily?

575
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:02,590
Look at 'em. I promised
Jack no one gets on our sand.

576
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,180
Courage is something you find every day.

577
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,320
Selkie,wake up!

578
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,050
Today's the day we fght
for our piece of the world.

579
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,490
This is our islandI

580
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,850
Oh,its fantastic. Amazing!

581
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,510
Check it out,Dad. Totally undiscovered.

582
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,190
Course it's discovered,Edmund.
Cruise line done discovered it.

583
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,740

593
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,170
Two hamburger. Two

594
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,130
- Oh,no,no. Thats not a hamburger. Trust me.

596
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,100

597
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:09,830
I-I-I dont need a goat.
You-You need that goat.

598
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,520
You should wash your hands
before you touch anything else.

599
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,480
- Buy from me! Buy from me!
- I cant. I need Fire Mountain.

600
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:18,180
- I know what you need. I take you.
- You know Fire Mountain?

601
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,820
Its 20 degrees south
and 1 62 degrees west.

602
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,500

- I dont need any toothbrushes.

605
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,330
I always bring my own. Thank you.

606
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,790
You can use that for yourself.
Your own teeth. Brush,brush.

607
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,920
Okay. Thank you. Good-bye.

I know what you need. I take you.

611
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,380
You wouldnt happen to have any hand sanitizer
up there amongst all those Coke cans,would you?

612
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:52,310
I know what you need. I take you.

Trust,trust. Thats easy for you to say.

617
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,360
Trust is the secret to adventure.

618
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,020
Chapter four,The Trek to Kilimanjaro.

619

Ah. See?What did I tell you? -

622
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,420
They've come to the wrong place.

623
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,660
Nobody invades my island
and gets away with it.

624
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,890

There are no horrible creatures,Mum.

But,uh,how many lizards can fly,Captain?

No. No. It doesnt feel just

01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,680
You cant say that. Youre a hero!

784
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:52,350
Im not a hero. I wish I were.
Im just a helicopter pilot.

785
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,390
No,youre the hero,Alexandra.

786
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,610
You came all the way down here
just to answer a distress call.

787
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:03,190
You-You seized the moment,claiming
control of this part of your life!

788
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,890
-  Im gonna be sick.
- No,no. No,no,no,no.

789
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,190
- You can't. OhI
- Whats that?

790
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,670
I-I think its a cruise ship.

791
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,620
- I'm taking her down. We land there.
- There?

792
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,970
No!

793
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,920
South by southeast,full speed.

794
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,420
Captain,you might want to see this.

795
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:41,400
Good Lord.

796
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:52,080
No more!No more! No more!

797
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:54,720
Oh,thank you!

798
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,930
Who gave you permission
to land on my ship?

799
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,470
- Who are you?
- Im Alex Rover.

800
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:06,420
Alex Rover? The adventurer?

801
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:10,080
No! The writer!

802
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:16,070
Come on now! Dont let me down
here! Youre my last chance!

803
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,490
Come on! Come on!

804
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,360
Thats it!

805
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:23,440
Come on!

806
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,440
You did it!

807
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,970
Whoo-hooI Okay. Come onI

808
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:33,150
Take me home! Come on,Mother Nature!

809
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,110
Take me back to Nim!

810
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,560
I know the coordinates perfectly
well. Theyre right in my head.

811
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,590
It is,uh,20 degrees
south,1 62 degrees west.

812
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,720
Theres a little girl there.

813
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,130
Theres no girl for 200 miles.

814
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:52,240
Oh,but she's-she's
all alone on an island.

815
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,350
And but-but
what-

816
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,390
Why is everybody looking
at me like Im crazy?

817
01:08:56,410 --> 01:09:00,510
Weve just come from the nearest island.
Trust me,no human being could survive there.

818
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,790
- Just take me to the island!
- Young lady,were battling a bloody monsoon here.

819
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,550
Now,this ship is full throttle at
sea and we will not be coming about.

820
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:08,520
Uh,but-
I-

821
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,510
Captain,shes not
playing with a full deck.

822
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:13,830
You should have the medic come
and give her a little sedation.

823
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,660
- Yeah,why don't you do that,huh?
- Yeah.

824
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:18,450
- Eddie?
- Hes probably after the dessert tray.

825
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,780
I know shes there. You
know,I mean,I heard her voice.

826
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,720
I didnt really hear her
voice. I got her e-mails.

827
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,530
- Youre not crazy.
- Im not?

828
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:30,530
I know it. I saw her. Shes real.

829
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,810
- She-Shes real? -
And shes on the island.

830
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,510
Oh. Thanks. Thanks.

831
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:40,140
The way you are handling it,the poise
with which you are handling this situation-

832
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:43,790
- Ships medic is on his way,Captain.
- Thank you,Ensign.

833
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,300
- Hey! Hey! After her!
- Security!

834
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,720
Bingo in five minutes.

835
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:05,240
Stop her! Someone stop her!

836
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:11,440
Oh,stupid suitcase! Oh,you dropped soup.

837
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:14,940

Don't let her goI

841
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:46,930
What on earth are you doing?

842
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,470
Just having a nervous breakdown!

843
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,360
No,no,no,no,no. No,dont do this!

844
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:01,780
I will not give up,Nim!

845
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:04,480
I promise you!

01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,220
Are you all right,Daddy?

850
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,380

01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,650
We have to save him!

853
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:30,080
Nim? Nim!

Is that you? Nim?

857
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,810
Is that you? Nim.

858
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,040

Alex Rover,hes a man. Hes a hero.

01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:37,400
He was gonna help me find my dad.

865
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:40,660
He saves people. He doesnt need saving.

866
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:43,010

871
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,970
But I didnt say I needed you.

01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:02,910
- You have to go. - What are

874
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:09,630
This is our island,okay?

01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,000
And we dont want anyone else here! Okay?

Apparently,she can do quite
well. She doesnt need me.

881
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,770
Of course she needs you.

882
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:43,100
And to be honest,you
kinda need her as well.

883
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,820

You cannot be alone for the

What?Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah.
Okay. Okay,look.

No more adventures.

01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,360
- Youre on your own. -
You-You-You cant quit.

897
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:43,710
I created you,and you have to do
what I say,not-not the opposite.

898
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:48,060
Good-bye,old friend. Good luck.

899
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:51,980
But wa-Wait! Wait! Come back!

900
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,740
Go to the little girl!

901
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:22,090
Nim?  Oh! What was that?

902
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,490
Oh,God.Just kill me now
and just get it over with.

903
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,340
Nim? Help!

904
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:38,650
Uh,Nim? HelpI

Can you hear me? It's so dark out hereI

906
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:47,780
Nim?

907
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:51,820
Nim? Come on,help me.

908
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,860
I traveled halfway around
the world. I took a plane.

909
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:58,940
I took a helicopter. I
- I stole a boat.

910
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,060
The least you can do is help
me get the last hundred yards.

911
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:09,540
Nim? Nim.

912
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:11,560
Im sorry you dont want me here...

913
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,490
but I
- I just thought I was doin the right thing.

914
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:22,410
Oh. Oh,no.Oh,no. Oh.

915
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,390
This is how it ends.

916
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,570
A bright light in the darkness.

917
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,530
My- My worst
nightmare-

918
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,930
Death by
- death by firefly!

919
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,370
Thank you,Nim.

920
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:04,570
How long have you lived here?

921
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,880
As long as I can remember.

922
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:13,230
You can go in if you want.

923
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,870

Nim,how long has your father been gone?

But when Jack sets his mind on

- Hell be back.

01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:03,200
- I didnt?
- No.

941
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:08,020
I mean,all Alex Rover ever does
is try new things all the time.

942
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,070
So?

943
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:26,520
How is it?

944
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,860
Chewy.

945
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,350
Its chewier than Id expected...

946
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:38,600
and its,uh,not disgusting.

947
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,600
What was I possibly thinking?

948
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:31,710
Uh. Oh,okay,okay.

949
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:35,070
Nim?

950
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,400
Nim?

951
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:43,760
Nim?

952
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:31,180
Its beautiful.

953
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,860
Its empty.

954
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,430
Maybe-

955
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,940
Maybe hes-hes just lost.

956
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:45,820
No.

957
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:49,230
No,my
- my dad is smarter than that.

958
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,340
If his boat was all right,he
would be home by now.

959
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,230
You-You found your way all
the way from San Francisco...

960
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,870
and you dont know how to do anything.

961
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,610
My dad would be back
from Zanders Atoll...

962
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:12,780
if he was still alive.

963
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:18,520
Hes not coming back,Alexandra.

964
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:22,130
Oh,look.I-

965
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,540
Listen to me.

966
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:34,460
No matter what happens...

967
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:39,700
whether its here or anywhere...

968
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:42,390
Ill take care of it.

969
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:46,580
You-You will not be alone.

970
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:10,270
What-What-What
is that?

971
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,780
Galileo?

972
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:35,580
Its him.

973
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,110
It's himI DaddyI

974
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,950

977
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,960
Daddy! Daddy!

978
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:21,530
- Oh. Nimmy! Oh! Oh,my God.
- Youre here! Youre alive!

979
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,980
Youre-Youre alive!

980
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:28,350
- I was so worried.
- I told you Id be back,didnt I?

981
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:30,370
Oh. Look at you.

982
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:33,320
Oh,I missed you so much.

983
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,940
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I am now.

984
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:41,930
Thank you,Galileo!

985
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:44,160
Thank you,GalileoI

986
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:46,300
Whats this?

987
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:49,630
- Protozoa Nim?
- I dont know.

988
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,800
I have a pretty good feeling about it.

989
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:55,340
Come here.

990
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,740
- What?
- Hi.

991
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:10,800
Whos this?

992
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:14,320
Dad,this is Alex Rover.

993
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,720
Alex Rover? I thought-

994
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,860
She wrote the books,Dad.

995
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:23,200
This is Alexandra Rover,the writer.

996
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:25,990
From San Francisco.

997
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:31,840
You must beJack Rusoe,the scientist.

998
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,450
Uh,yeah,Jack...

999
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,940
the scientist,yeah.

1000
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,800
What,Daddy?

1001
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:44,500
Oh,nothing. Im sorry.

1002
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:48,370
I just imagined Alex Rover so...

1003
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,800
well,differently.

1004
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,980
''The Writer and the Scientist. ''

1005
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:59,710
That's how their story began.

1006
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,190
How it ends exactly...

1007
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,020
nobody knows.

1008
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:09,190
# It's a beautiful day #

1009
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:15,530
# The sky falls,you feel

1012
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,520
# But you've got no destination #

1013
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:29,230
# You're in the mud #

1014
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:32,640
# In the maze ofher imagination #

1015
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,830
# You love this town #

1016
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:40,400
# Even if that doesn't ring true #

1017
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:43,570
# You've been all over #

1018
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:46,440
# And it's been all over you #
