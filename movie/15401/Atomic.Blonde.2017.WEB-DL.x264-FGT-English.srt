00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:21,218
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

18
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:23,020
It was Satchel, wasn't it?

19
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:25,022
Satchel gave me up.

20
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:31,362
I always thought,
if I got tagged,

21
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:33,798
it would be by the best.

22

But you're not the best,
are you, Bakhtin?

23
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:40,738
You're the biggest fucking cunt

Where's C?

50
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:20,451
Given the scale
of recent world events,

51
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,486
C will not be joining us.

52
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:27,091
Yes, of course.

53
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:38,202
The voices on record
are the following:

54
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:41,305
myself, Senior Directorate
Officer Eric Gray;

55
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,374
our American guest,
Emmett Kurzfeld

56
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:46,310
of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency;

57
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:47,754
and returning
British Operational Officer

58
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:49,346
Lorraine Broughton.

59
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,148
Before we begin, sir,
may I formally request

60
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:52,583
that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed

61
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,418
- from the debriefing.
- Request denied.

62
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:57,421
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear.

63
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:00,157
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing,

64
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,434
- not its controller.
- I understand that.

65
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,560
I was there, in Berlin.

66
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:07,531
And I'm here with the full
executive authority of Langley.

67
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:09,333
If it'd make you
more comfortable,

68
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:12,436
I could stand behind the mirror
with everybody else.

69
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:15,038
But it's a little crowded
back there.

70
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:19,210
Cocksucker.

71
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:21,445
What did you say?

72
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:23,280
I didn't say anything.

73
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:25,449
I'm sorry. Did you say
something, Lorraine?

74
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,184
Did you hear me say something?

75
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:29,720
- I thought you said something.
- What did she say?

76
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,388
What?

77
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,559
Well...

78
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:38,162
do you want
to play the tape back?

79
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,338
Well, then...

80
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:50,841
Shall we begin?

81
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:55,179
Berlin.

82
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,514
What happened?

83
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:59,150
Yeah.

84
00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:00,784
Berlin.

85
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:07,158
Fuck.

86
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:16,700
Ah. Lorraine.

87
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,702
Sorry to bring you in
on such short notice.

88
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,272
You know C.

89
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:23,707
- Yes.
- We were just going over your file.

90
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,642
I see your Russian
is excellent.

91
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:28,379
An expert in escape
and evasion.

92
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,214
Proficient
in intelligence collection

93
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:31,515
and hand-to-hand combat.

94
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:33,884
It's an impressive set
of skills.

95
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,487
Knowing the Reds as I do,

96
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,489
she'll need to use
every damn one of them.

97
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,758
I'll get straight to the point.

98
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,627
How well do you know
James Gascoigne?

99
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,429
Enough to say hello.

100
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:46,797
We worked together

101
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,699
- in Istanbul in '85.
- He's dead.

102
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:55,439
Gascoigne was killed last night
on a mission in Berlin.

103
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:56,873
The West German Police

104
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:59,576
fished his body out
of the Spree this morning.

105
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,647
And the coroner extracted
a 7.62 Tokarev round

106
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,216
from the base of his skull.

107
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:06,583
Soviets.

108
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:08,819
Yesterday, Gascoigne met
with a Stasi officer,

109
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:11,488
code-named Spyglass.

110
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,390
We promised Spyglass immunity

111
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,226
in exchange
for a document on microfilm,

112
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,228
code-named "the list."

113
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:19,330
Hidden in a Swiss watch,
no less.

114
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:22,633
The list contains every active
clandestine officer,

115
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,335
all their shady deals.

116
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,603
It's an atomic bomb
of information

117
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:29,440
that could extend the Cold War
for another 40 years.

118
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:33,977
And we believe the man that
killed Gascoigne now has it.

119
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,381
Our sources point
to Yuri Bakhtin,

120
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:40,517
a KGB hatchet man with more
than a dozen confirmed kills.

121
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,319
So you want me in Moscow?

122
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,587
No.

123
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,656
Bakhtin never got
on the flight.

124
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,260
So he's still in Berlin,
along with the list.

125
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:51,862
Everyone's hunting for it.

126
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:53,330
The Yanks, the Frogs.

127
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,565
Soviets, of course.

128
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:56,267
And our man, Percival.

129
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,568
Who's Percival?

130
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:58,902
David Percival.

131
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:00,504
He's our number one in Berlin.

132
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:04,408
He's your point of contact now.

That's really nice.

147
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:42,946
Now, where's that fucking list?

148
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,549
I gave the microfilm
to Gascoigne last night.

149
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:47,050
James didn't show up.

150
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,452
I did my part.

151
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:49,820
I gave him the list.

152
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:51,822
You have to get me
and my family across.

153
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:53,590
It's not safe
for us anymore here.

154
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:55,592
The Russians are onto me.

155
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,060

158
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,400
You listen to me, Spyglass.

159
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:04,711
Without that list, why
shouldn't I take you outside

160
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,945
and shoot you
in the fucking head?

161
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:08,639
You are going to kill
a Stasi officer?

162
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:10,774
One that's about to defect
to the West? Yeah.

163
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,976
Without an embassy
to look after him,

164
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,579
Percival has gone
somewhat native.

165
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,314
Gone fucking feral.

166
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:19,082
Berlin is the Wild West.

167
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:20,751
If that bloody wall
comes crashing down,

168
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:22,686
we don't want to be under it.

169
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:26,923
If the Russians get that list,
we're all buggered sideways.

170
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,026
You're Elizabeth Lloyd.

171
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,828
A Cambridge-educated lawyer

172
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:33,364
sent by
James Gascoigne's family

173
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:34,765
to retrieve
the body and effects

174
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:36,633
of their recently deceased son.

175
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,802
Your mission is to connect
with Percival

176
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:41,338
and do whatever it takes
to get that list home.

177
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:44,408
And remember, Lorraine,
this is highly sensitive.

178
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:46,777
Trust no one.

179
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:54,017
Follow me! Come, come, come!

180
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:56,553
Quickly! This way.

181
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:57,954
Tell me you made a copy.

182
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,690
- I memorized it.
- Memorized it?

183
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,124
Every single agent
on that list?

184
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:03,494
Every Wednesday, you visit
the Penny Lane brothel.

185
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:06,096
Your favorite girl is Margot.
Her real name is Maria.

186
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,998
Maria?

187
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:09,666
All right, I'll get you across.

188
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,835
- You're a good man, Percival.
- Fuck off.

189
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,404
I just want the list.
Once I've...

190
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:14,705
- Oh, fuck.
- Halt!

191
00:13:14,738 --> 00:13:15,906
I'll be in touch.

192
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,875
Uh...

193
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:20,411
Document. Document.

194
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:21,878
Oh, gee...

195
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:44,561
Oh, I'm so fucking late.

196
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:00,243
Welcome to

197
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,445
Tempelhof
International Airport.

198
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:30,741
Miss Broughton,
Mr. Percival was running late.

199
00:15:30,774 --> 00:15:32,676
He sent me to pick you up.

200
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,044
Checked bags?

201
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:35,779
No, they've been sent.

202
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,681
Please, follow me.

203
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:06,042
So... is this your first time
in Berlin?

204
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,978
Yes.

205
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:10,246
Well, it's a remarkable time
to be here.

206
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,284
Wonderful music,
superb nightlife,

207
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,152
marvelous restaurants.

208
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:19,823
You must try the Central Cafe
for a drink.

209
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,658
You'll need it later.

210
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,800
You remember Mr. Bremovych,
don't you?

211
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,305
Of course you do.

212
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:38,942
Well, he's very curious

213
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:40,644
what you're doing here
in Berlin.

214
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:48,852
What the fuck are you doing?

215
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:25,956
What the fuck are you doing?

216
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:44,975
Welcome to Berlin.

217
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:46,276
I'm David...

218
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:48,244
Where the fuck were you?

219
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:50,947
Don't shoot.
I-I've got your shoe.

220
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:56,853
Let me help you with your bags.

221
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:00,356
Come on.

222
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,825
Fuck's sake.

223
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,894
Russians are fucking heavy.

224
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:05,829
Five minutes on the ground,

225
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,398
- and I'm already made.
- You're not made, I hope.

226
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,000
- They knew my name.
- That's troubling.

227
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:12,402
- And yours.
- That's hardly surprising.

228
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:16,907
Great fucking start, Percival.

229
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:26,883
So, what was
your first impression?

230
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,284
Of David?

231
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:30,453
Well...

232
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,055
he was handsome.

233
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,824
Late 30s.

234
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,227
Disastrous
Sinead O'Connor hair.

235
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,462
Irish singer.

236
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,741
- Mmm.
- I asked him what the deal was with that,

237
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:45,736
and he said,
"It's to blend in."

238
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:47,370
Want to touch it?

239
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:49,339
It's to blend in, in the East.

240
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,288
That was the Brandenburg Gate,
by the way.

241
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:58,148
I mean, how the fuck
do the suits think

242
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:00,326
that you're going to be able
to help me find that list?

243
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,152
As soon as you pick up
Gascoigne's body,

244
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:03,930
they'll null and void
your visa, and you'll be on

245
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:05,364
- the first flight back home.
- I'll figure it out.

246
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,824
That's Checkpoint Charlie.

247
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,325
My office is just back there.

248
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,962
I'm not here to collect
postcards, Percival.

249
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,297
Just drop me at my hotel.
It's around the corner.

250
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,000
I thought you said you'd
never been to Berlin before.

251
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,501
I can read a fucking map.

252
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,037
This will just take a minute.

253
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,947
What are you doing?

254
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:33,116
Sending a message
to that fascist pig.

255
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:41,157
Say hello
to Comrade Bremovych for me.

256
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,239
Bremovych...

257
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:30,967
Whoo!

258
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:19,282
Tensions are high
in East Berlin tonight

259
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,651
as civil disobedience
continues to build momentum.

260
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:24,354
East Berlin's youth leaders
shout out their protests

261
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:26,256
through tear gas
and water cannons.

262
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,491
And there are numerous reports
of police

263
00:22:28,524 --> 00:22:31,928
beating peaceful demonstrators
with batons.

264
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:47,978
♪ How does it feel

265
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:54,617
♪ To treat me like you do?

266
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:05,361
I've been sent to arrange

267
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:07,363
the return
of a British subject.

268
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:08,999
The body was identified

269
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,466
by your attaché.

270
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,302
Yes, I believe so.

271
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:14,037
This was not a question.

272
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,338
It was a statement.

273
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:18,508
♪ How does it feel

274
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,444
♪ To treat me like you do?

275
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:23,446
He was your colleague?

276
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,248
Different department.

277
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:27,417
- Which department?
- A different one.

278
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:32,022
You have the transfer papers?

279
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,602
You know those movies

280
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:49,672
where the picture
just starts to slow down...

281
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:51,607
...and melt?

282
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:55,245
Then catch fire?

283
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:59,049
Well...

284
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:02,685
...that's Berlin.

285
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:06,422
The passport number
is incorrect.

286
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:08,058
I will not release this body

287
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,359
without the correct
information.

288
00:24:09,392 --> 00:24:10,632
It's a simple mistake.

289
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,228
Miss Lloyd, in Germany,

290
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,297
we don't make simple mistakes.

291
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:13,323
I'm not going to lie,
I'm impressed.

292
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:15,391
You've got some balls
breaking in here.

293
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:16,726
You should see my balls.

294
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,261
Then you'd be really impressed.

295
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:20,563
Hmm.
I'll take your word for it.

296
00:25:20,596 --> 00:25:22,532
I see you found a way to stay.

297
00:25:22,565 --> 00:25:25,168
You wrote "16"
when it should have said "76."

298
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,569
That's right.

299
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:28,371
I'm not going anywhere.

300
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:30,173
I'm here for at least
another week.

301
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,308
Lucky fucking me.

302
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,843
They won't release the body now

303
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:36,279
until they've investigated
that red-tape nightmare.

304
00:25:36,312 --> 00:25:38,114
How the fuck
did you get in here?

305
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:40,116
You know, I've been
in Berlin a long time,

306
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,684
and I think I know
every doorman

307
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:45,555
of every decent shithouse,
borderline decent flophouse

308
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:47,357
both sides of the wall.

309
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,759
Well, then you must know
Spyglass.

310
00:25:51,294 --> 00:25:53,329
Never met the fellow.

311
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,198
He was James's.

312
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:58,301
What do you know
about this woman

313
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,536
who's been following me
since Tempelhof?

314
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:05,508
I'd say that you're
an attractive woman

315
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,777
and you should do the math.

316
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:11,381
You know,
if I was to follow you,

317
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:14,484
I mean, properly,
you'd never fucking know.

318
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:18,354
There's a knack to it,
isn't there?

319
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:21,457
It's like walking a tightrope
or playing the bagpipes.

320
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:24,294
You can either do it
or you can't.

321
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:27,597
Knock yourself out.

322
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,825
I'd like to purchase a watch.

323
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:00,863
I need access to a network
in East Berlin.

324
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:06,469
Come back tomorrow
before closing.

325
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:09,372
East Berlin is on
a short fuse again tonight

326
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:13,776
as Communist Party officials
struggle to maintain order.

327
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:15,978
How well do you know
James Gascoigne?

328
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,647
He's dead.

329
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,758
- You need to be careful.
- The coroner extracted

330
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:22,985
a 7.62 Tokarev round
from the base of his skull.

331
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,487
Soviets.

332
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,422
We know who Satchel is.

333
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,359
You need to run.

334
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:41,364
You expected to find the list

335
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:43,065
in Gascoigne's apartment.

336
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,700
You realize you were late
to the party.

337
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:46,602
Percival, the Russians...

338
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:49,004
everybody must have already
ransacked the place.

339
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:50,640
Yes.

340
00:28:50,673 --> 00:28:54,910
But the list
wasn't our only problem.

341
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:58,648
Before I left,
he told me one last thing.

342
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,387
This is exactly why
I didn't want the CIA present.

343
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:10,993
Spyglass revealed
that this list

344
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:14,063
would expose a double agent
by the name of Satchel.

345
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:18,067
I want Satchel, dead or alive.

346
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,571
This traitor has been
a thorn in our side for years.

347
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:23,573
He's a black eye to the Crown.

348
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:25,007
And the single biggest

349
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,810
intelligence leak
in MI6 history.

350
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:31,714
You expose this bastard,
Satchel,

351
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:34,384
and we'll hang him for treason.

352
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:38,488
You might find yourself taking
tea at Buckingham Palace.

353
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:41,824
So no, I wasn't just looking

354
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:45,060
for the list
in Gascoigne's apartment.

355
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,082
Percival and I seem to have

356
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:10,085
a different definition
for collaboration.

357
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:14,156
What's that supposed to mean?

358
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,958
He was the only one who knew

359
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:17,960
I was going
to Gascoigne's apartment.

360
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:20,763
And if I knew he was
going to call the police,

361
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:22,465
I would have worn
a different outfit.

362
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,002
♪ All I wanted

363

00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,106

402
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,683
With repeated calls
for change on the streets

403
00:32:53,716 --> 00:32:55,985
and the protesters
growing ever more confident,

404
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,754
time is running out
for the East German government.

405
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:00,322
Popular opinion has it

406
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,625
that the Communists' claim
to leadership

407
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:04,226
can't be upheld much longer.

408
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,729
And if rapid change
is not forthcoming,

409
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:08,864
today's relatively calm
protests

410
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:12,802
could be seen as the calm
before the storm.

411
00:33:12,835 --> 00:33:15,671
It's not just new faces
that are called for,

412
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:18,641
but perhaps a complete
demolition of the wall.

413
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:41,664
Mmm.

414
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:47,770
Let me take your coat.

415
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:57,179
Make yourself at home.

416
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,189
Fucking hell.

417
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:10,292
You want a pair of jeans?

418
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:11,994
Help yourself.

419
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,675
Hmm.

420
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,910
Your library
includes Larry Flynt?

421
00:34:29,011 --> 00:34:30,880
Champion of free speech.

422
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:33,849
Hmm.

423
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,086
What have you found on Bakhtin?

424
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,922
Look, if Bakhtin wanted
the Russians to have that list,

425
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:42,324
he would have given it
to them by now.

426
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:44,960
We just have to wait
for him to make his move.

427
00:34:44,994 --> 00:34:46,662
We can't afford to wait.

428
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:48,097
This is your city, Percival.

429
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,767
Or do you only know
doormen and bellhops?

430
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:59,008
So, what did you find
in Gascoigne's apartment?

431
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,043
Some Deutsche Marks,

432
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:03,746
empty passports, travel visas

433
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:07,683
and a picture of the two of you
together a few years back.

434
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:14,156
Did I not mention
that we were friends?

435
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:15,290
- No.
- No?

436
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:17,659
No, I must have forgot to.

437
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:23,032
Get your coat, love.

438
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,101
We're going for a walk.

439
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:34,443
Look, we're all
exposed by that list.

440
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:37,913
And saving the world
is cool and all that,

441
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:40,716
but my main objective
is staying alive.

442
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,193
I've been head of
Berlin Station for ten years.

443
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:43,819
You've got to know
that I'm the only man

444
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,430
in this town that can help you
get that list.

445
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:47,089
Yes, I've read your file.

446
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:49,191
I've also read your dog file.

447
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:52,261
So let's cut the crap,
shall we?

448
00:35:52,294 --> 00:35:54,764
This whole hungover,
show-up-late,

449
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:58,000
don't-know-which-way-is-up act,
I'm not buying it.

450
00:35:58,033 --> 00:36:01,103
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

451
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:03,405
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

452
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:05,307
Niccolo Machiavelli.

453
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:08,143
It was on your shelf.

454
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:11,113
Oh, my God,
I think I fucking love you.

455
00:36:11,146 --> 00:36:12,748
That's too bad.

456
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:17,820
If Percival was telling
the truth about Bakhtin,

457
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:21,256
I needed to figure out
what the Russians knew.

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,425
I'm not speaking German
tonight.

473
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:32,227
So, you're British?

474
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:38,934
Very impressive.

475
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:42,905
This can't be your only talent.

476
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,575
Talents can be overrated.

477
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:49,211
A dedication...

478
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:52,047
a loyalty
is very rare these days.

479
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,856
Everyone here is searching
for something.

480
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:04,626
What are you looking for?

481
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:08,097
Well, when all's said and done,
wouldn't you say deep down

482
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,566
we're all just searching
for the same thing?

483
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:20,309
I leave you alone
for only a moment,

484
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,077
and already you are
attracting admirers.

485
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:25,881
Monsieur,
three is not always a crowd,

486
00:38:25,915 --> 00:38:27,950
but tonight it is.

487
00:38:27,983 --> 00:38:29,084
Hmm.

488
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:30,920
French women.

489
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:35,024
What about the British?

490
00:38:35,057 --> 00:38:38,360
Maybe we could make
some sort of, uh, arrangement.

491
00:38:40,629 --> 00:38:42,631
We haven't seen each other
in a long time,

492
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:44,599
and we really need to catch up.

493
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:48,403
Alone.

494
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:51,473
Ladies,
Berlin is a small place.

495
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:54,876
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

496
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:07,089
Sorry.

497
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:09,558
You looked like
you needed saving.

498
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:14,563
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, Miss...

499
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:16,031
Lasalle.

500
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:17,232
Delphine Lasalle.

501
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,401
Pleased to meet you.

502
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:24,173
So, what do you do, Delphine?

503
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:27,376
I'm a part-time translator
who really wants to be a poet.

504
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,078
Maybe a rock star.

505
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:36,151
My friend owns a club nearby.

506
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:37,486
Want to come check it out?

507
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:39,488
- Now?
- Sure.

508
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:43,225
I can't.

509
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:46,428
Well, I'll give you
the address anyway.

510
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:49,131
Come meet me there
tomorrow night?

511
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:52,434
Will you come?

512
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:55,604
Maybe?

513
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:58,173
You're relentless.

514
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:00,075
Oui.

515
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:04,279
David Hasselhoff's in town.

516
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:06,548
Lucky us.

517
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,683
Berlin is truly doomed.

518
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:32,307
Your watch is ready.

519
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:35,144
It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.

520
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:46,288
I think you'll find my contact
very useful.

521
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,770
Your watch is ready.

522
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:04,273
It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.

523
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,643
I think you'll find my contact
very useful.

524
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:12,214
East Berliners stormed

525
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:14,549
the West German embassies
in Czechoslovakia

526
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,251
earlier this week,
as the Czech government

527
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:18,187
has begun to wave the refugees

528
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,222
through checkpoints
with few questions.

529
00:41:20,255 --> 00:41:23,125
One has to ask how long
the East Berlin government

530
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:24,826
can hold on...

Bakhtin and the list

539
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,383
had not yet surfaced
in the West.

540
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,385
I needed to meet
my new contact

541
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:53,388
and see what I was up against
in the East.

542
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:03,098
You should have applied
for a visitor's permit.

543
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,335
What kind of work do you do?

544
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:07,736
Legal affairs.

545
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,747
If you do not return
before 6:00,

546
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,249
you will be arrested.

547
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:21,416
Do you understand?

548
00:42:22,517 --> 00:42:23,585
I understand.

549
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,561
Right now I'm not feeling
very confident

550
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,229
about this story of yours.

551
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,766
Why not use Percival's
connections in the East?

552
00:42:39,301 --> 00:42:41,770
He told me...

553
00:42:41,803 --> 00:42:44,139
to trust no one.

554
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:48,510
Hello?

555
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:53,675
Go there.

556
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:55,156
You are late.

557
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:57,492
And you were followed.

558
00:46:57,526 --> 00:47:00,028
I'm late
because I was followed.

559
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:03,832
I lost them 20 minutes ago
near the Palast der Republik.

560
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,435
You're as good
as your reputation.

561
00:47:06,468 --> 00:47:08,603
Are you sure this
is the best place to meet?

562
00:47:09,971 --> 00:47:11,673
Keep your enemies close.

563
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:15,644
I'm a permanent fixture
for them now.

564
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:18,713
The Watchmaker says

565
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:21,015
there has been great interest
in this list

566
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:23,151
on the black market
the last few days.

567
00:47:23,184 --> 00:47:25,587
- Any sign of Bakhtin?
- No.

568
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,122
This Satchel character
has people worried

569
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:29,924
on both sides of the wall.

570
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:31,926
Yeah.

571
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,195
What kind of network
have you assembled?

572
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:37,699
There's a lot of, uh,
dissatisfied youth

573
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,801
on this side of the wall.

574
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,774
They're like a...

575
00:47:45,807 --> 00:47:48,477
tinderbox.

576
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,844
If you find the right spark...

577
00:47:52,947 --> 00:47:54,816
Keep talking.

578
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:35,990
I am interested
in selling a watch.

579
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:38,793
What are you selling?

580
00:48:38,827 --> 00:48:40,795
It is extremely valuable.

581
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:43,632
Finest quality and...

582
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:45,700
filled with secrets.

583
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,945
Would you mind if I inspect
the merchandise?

584
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:02,584
Fuck yes, I mind.

585
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:07,922
Just tell potential buyers
Bakhtin is open for business.

586
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:26,541
Ladies,
Berlin is a small place.

587

you needed saving.

590

615

You're Lorraine Broughton, MI6,

616
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:19,220
and you're here because
of the death of Gascoigne.

617
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:24,125
What do you know
about Gascoigne?

shouldn't we all care?

Whatever is in that list has
people willing to kill for it.

622
00:51:52,286 --> 00:51:55,456
This is my first assignment
with the French intelligence.

623
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:57,726
I've only been here a year.

624
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:01,062
I'm scared, okay?

625
00:52:01,095 --> 00:52:04,866
I got into this
because it was exciting.

626
00:52:04,899 --> 00:52:07,301
But it's never been
like this in Berlin.

627
00:52:10,304 --> 00:52:12,707

653
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:13,287
We needed to get you
a message, Lorraine.

654
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:16,590
We're several days into a
mission without a single lead.

655
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:19,427
And plenty of distractions.

656
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,196
You have to be reminded
of the course at hand.

657
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,265
Oh, I received your message.

658
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:40,581
That's quite a view.

659
00:55:40,614 --> 00:55:43,351
70 miles of barbed wire,

660
00:55:43,384 --> 00:55:47,521
310 guard towers,
65 anti-vehicle trenches,

661
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:52,526
40,000 Soviet-trained,
heavily armed frontier troops.

662
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,031
All that,
and 5,000 GDR citizens

663
00:55:57,065 --> 00:55:59,567
still had the brass balls
to escape.

664
00:56:01,502 --> 00:56:03,204
You've got the MI6 so worried

665
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:06,340
they called the CIA
to talk sense into you.

666
00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:11,212
Eric Gray called me.

667
00:56:11,245 --> 00:56:13,147
Of course he did.

668
00:56:13,181 --> 00:56:16,217
I don't have to remind you of
how fast the clock is ticking.

669
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,186
If this thing gets out,

670
00:56:18,219 --> 00:56:20,721
a lot of good,
hard-working folks...

671
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:24,425
brave men and women
are going to show up dead.

672
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,594
You and I included.

673
00:56:26,627 --> 00:56:28,596
I swear to God,
the last few weeks,

674
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:31,665
I dread even waking up
in the morning.

675
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:36,971
I understand the severity
of the situation, sir.

676
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:38,639
And the time imperative.

677
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:43,144
Listen, I didn't climb
all the way up here

678
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:46,047
just to give you
some rousing pep talk.

679
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,182
So I'll cut to the chase.

680
00:56:48,216 --> 00:56:50,318
Last night, you met a woman.

681
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:54,488
Delphine Lasalle
is out of her depth.

682
00:56:54,522 --> 00:56:57,225
Given the climate, I'd hate
to see an executive order

683
00:56:57,258 --> 00:57:01,495
come down the line
that falls in her disinterest.

684
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:04,198
Her disinterest?

685
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:06,400
What do you mean,
her disinterest?

686
00:57:06,434 --> 00:57:08,202
Don't insult my intelligence,
Lorraine.

687
00:57:08,236 --> 00:57:11,372
You know exactly
what I fucking mean.

688
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:13,574
Hope you get a snapshot.

689
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:17,178
Next week, this will be
a whole different picture.

690
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:28,522
Central has been compromised.

691
00:57:57,551 --> 00:58:00,154
♪ Stronger than reason

692
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:04,125
♪ Stronger than lies

693
00:58:04,158 --> 00:58:07,361
♪ The only truth I know

694
00:58:07,395 --> 00:58:12,833
♪ Is the look in your eyes

695
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:20,541
♪ The look in your eyes...

696
00:58:33,621 --> 00:58:37,191
Meet me at the Rough
Trade Bar at Oranienstrasse.

697
00:58:37,225 --> 00:58:38,692
We need to talk.

698
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:41,595
♪ Just like a knife

699
00:58:41,629 --> 00:58:45,233
♪ My favorite weapon

700
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:50,404
♪ Is the look in your eyes...

701
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:56,477
Look at all these hedonists.

702
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:00,080
It's like a beautiful woman
gone wrong. I fucking love it.

703
00:59:01,749 --> 00:59:04,152
Word is Bakhtin has resurfaced.

704
00:59:04,185 --> 00:59:06,454
Cops found him
with a homemade lobotomy.

705
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:09,357
Either way,
we have to deal with Spyglass.

706
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,825
Thinking it through, he doesn't
have much time over there.

707
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:13,427
Our priority is the list.

708
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:15,629
- We can't make mistakes.
- Come on.

709
00:59:15,663 --> 00:59:18,166
He's hardly the most
trustworthy person I ever met.

710
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:19,609
Or the fucking brightest.

711
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:21,502
Wait.
You said you hadn't met him.

712
00:59:24,772 --> 00:59:27,508
I lied.

713
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:31,179
And he claims to have
memorized the entire list.

714
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:35,283
He's ready to make the jump.

715
00:59:35,316 --> 00:59:37,885
You believe he committed
the entire thing to memory?

716
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:40,788
Everything.

717
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:44,692
Had I known earlier, I would
have prioritized Spyglass.

718
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:47,561
His knowledge made him
as valuable as the list.

719
00:59:48,862 --> 00:59:50,664
I could have grabbed him
at any moment.

720
00:59:50,698 --> 00:59:52,800
Instead,
Percival kept it a secret,

721
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:55,336
putting us in
a precarious position.

722
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:03,711
Look, the KGB
are going to have

723
01:00:03,744 --> 01:00:06,347
some very angry bastards out
there looking for Spyglass.

724
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,748
We can't trust any
of the old

725
01:00:07,781 --> 01:00:08,816
usual methods.

726
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:10,351
It's not that difficult

727
01:00:10,384 --> 01:00:11,761
to drive across
the border these days.

728
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:14,688
It is when you're wanted
like Spyglass is.

729
01:00:14,722 --> 01:00:16,724
We have to walk him across
personally

730
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:19,460
to ensure his safety
in plain sight.

731
01:00:19,493 --> 01:00:21,471
We'll use the demonstration
tomorrow at Alexanderplatz.

732
01:00:21,495 --> 01:00:22,963
That's insane.

733
01:00:22,996 --> 01:00:26,200
All those protesters
will make a great distraction.

734
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:29,237
Spyglass is my guy.

735
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,571
We're going to do it my way.

736
01:00:32,773 --> 01:00:34,442
Fine.

737
01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:37,678
But we use my contact
to get all our papers in order.

738
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:40,281
All right.

739
01:00:40,314 --> 01:00:41,715
We have a deal?

740
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:46,754
I'll take that as a yes.

741
01:00:54,495 --> 01:00:58,632
You see...

742
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,468
I received a call

743
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:03,371
from David Percival
that evening, Lorraine.

744
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:12,580
He said he had the list.

745
01:01:12,613 --> 01:01:14,582
I'll need
a little time to wrap it up.

746
01:01:16,584 --> 01:01:18,686
And he knew
the identity of Satchel.

747
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:23,391
Oh, I'm very close to Satchel.

748
01:01:44,745 --> 01:01:47,415
And no one thought to tell me?

749
01:01:49,016 --> 01:01:50,684
Hmm?

750
01:01:54,922 --> 01:01:57,525
Fuck.

751
01:02:03,063 --> 01:02:05,566
You brought a lot of friends.

752
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,403
I heard Bakhtin
had a little accident.

753
01:02:09,437 --> 01:02:11,905
I heard he slipped
and fell on an ice pick.

754
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:13,374
Berlin's a cruel mistress.

755
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:15,976
Especially for traitors
like Bakhtin.

756
01:02:16,009 --> 01:02:17,678
Oh, don't be
such a fucking Communist.

757
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:18,979
You've got a problem.

758
01:02:19,012 --> 01:02:20,314
Yeah, I know.

759
01:02:20,348 --> 01:02:22,282
You have the fucking list.

760
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:26,019
We've been in the trenches
long enough to know

761
01:02:26,053 --> 01:02:29,390
that at times like this Berlin
has its own set of rules.

762
01:02:29,423 --> 01:02:33,026
I can give you information
that will keep the balance.

763
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,729
Now, are you in or out?

764
01:02:43,404 --> 01:02:45,906
Percival's trying to set me up.

765
01:02:49,777 --> 01:02:51,612
Are you surprised?

766
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,748
Not really.

767
01:02:54,782 --> 01:02:57,351
These relationships
aren't real.

768
01:02:57,385 --> 01:02:59,587
They're just a means to an end.

769
01:03:02,456 --> 01:03:05,426
When you tell the truth,
you look different.

770
01:03:05,459 --> 01:03:07,127
Your eyes change.

771
01:03:08,562 --> 01:03:10,330
Thanks for the warning.

772
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,067
What do you mean?

773
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:16,670
I mean,
I better not do it again.

774
01:03:22,576 --> 01:03:24,545
Why?

775
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:30,350
'Cause it's going to get me
killed one day.

Whatever went wrong did so
because someone wanted it to.

Someone from the inside.

805
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,910
Were you betrayed
by a fellow agent?

806
01:06:09,943 --> 01:06:12,012
You mean Satchel?

807

Would that be unheard of?

Per your request.

809
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:24,291
You won't be needing that.

810
01:06:24,324 --> 01:06:26,827
It will be worse
if they find it on you.

811
01:06:28,295 --> 01:06:30,097
Everything else ready?

812
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:32,032
Yes. Everything you requested.

01:06:32,065 --> 01:06:33,734
I'm ready.

814
01:06:37,337 --> 01:06:40,173
What do you think of his shirt?

815
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:42,610
I wouldn't be
caught dead in it.

816
01:06:42,643 --> 01:06:45,045
But for him, it's perfect.

817
01:06:45,078 --> 01:06:47,080
Stand over here.

818
01:06:49,149 --> 01:06:51,251
Now look like a free man.

819
01:06:55,255 --> 01:06:57,124
East Berlin peace leaders

820
01:06:57,157 --> 01:07:00,628
have organized a demonstration
this week at Alexanderplatz.

821
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:09,169
Did he tell you
I memorized the whole list?

822
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:12,072
Yes.

823
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,942
I realize I may not be

824
01:07:14,975 --> 01:07:16,810
as valuable
to some people and...

825
01:07:16,844 --> 01:07:20,180
some people may even
want me dead, but...

826
01:07:22,149 --> 01:07:24,084
...what choice do I have?

827
01:07:25,653 --> 01:07:27,688
You're no good to me dead.

828
01:07:27,721 --> 01:07:30,924
And I've never lost a package.

829
01:07:32,259 --> 01:07:35,128
I know.

830
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,301
Hey, hey, hey.

831
01:07:41,334 --> 01:07:43,370
It's his family.

832
01:07:45,072 --> 01:07:47,040
This was not part of the plan.

833
01:07:47,074 --> 01:07:48,776
Part of mine.

834
01:07:50,277 --> 01:07:52,145
Please.

835
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:53,781
I'll take the wife and kid.

836
01:07:53,814 --> 01:07:56,850
You just have to deal
with Spyglass.

837
01:07:56,884 --> 01:07:59,753
I don't know if I have
enough passports.

838
01:08:00,921 --> 01:08:02,690
Percival.

839
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:04,925
Your old golden boy.

840
01:08:37,124 --> 01:08:38,892
We have to go.

841
01:08:42,395 --> 01:08:44,331
See you in the West.

842
01:08:44,364 --> 01:08:45,465
Good luck.

843
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:42,089
This was never part
of the plan.

844
01:09:42,122 --> 01:09:44,157
It was part of mine.

845
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:38,445
Stay low.

846
01:10:45,919 --> 01:10:47,320
In here.

847
01:10:51,058 --> 01:10:52,592
I need to deal with this now,

848
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:54,561
or we'll never get across.

849
01:10:59,099 --> 01:11:00,267
I don't want to die.

850
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,169
You're not going to die.

851
01:11:02,202 --> 01:11:03,971
Stay here.

852
01:14:00,213 --> 01:14:01,614
Fuck.

853
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:17,297
Two more. There's two more.

854
01:15:01,174 --> 01:15:02,509
Go.

855
01:15:06,846 --> 01:15:09,082
You need to stop that bleeding.

856
01:15:09,116 --> 01:15:10,583
Search for anything.

857
01:15:10,617 --> 01:15:13,052
Alcohol, rags.

858
01:17:48,941 --> 01:17:50,977
Am I a bitch now?

859
01:18:41,794 --> 01:18:42,962
Get in.

860
01:18:44,063 --> 01:18:45,665
Get in!

861
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,742
You need to work
on your German.

862
01:18:58,945 --> 01:19:00,713
It's horrible.

863
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,352
What the hell?

864
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:15,562
Oh!

865
01:19:17,364 --> 01:19:19,932

01:19:19,966 --> 01:19:21,901

You all right?

883
01:20:45,552 --> 01:20:47,420
Yeah.

884
01:20:47,454 --> 01:20:49,689
We have to go...

885
01:21:01,868 --> 01:21:04,003
It's so cold!

886
01:21:04,036 --> 01:21:06,973
- Open your door.
- My foot is... it's stuck!

887
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:18,518
Just breathe.

888
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:36,062
- You need a break?
- No.

889
01:22:44,003 --> 01:22:46,673
So...

890
01:22:46,706 --> 01:22:48,741
Yes, I-I think I understand
everything.

891
01:22:48,775 --> 01:22:50,276
You made your plan.

892
01:22:50,309 --> 01:22:53,946
And you failed to get
the high-value asset

893
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,848
safely across to the West.

894
01:22:55,882 --> 01:22:58,651
You sent me into
a fucking hornet's nest.

895
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,188
I was made by the KGB

896
01:23:02,221 --> 01:23:04,190
from the moment my feet
touched the ground.

897
01:23:04,223 --> 01:23:06,092
Maybe even before.

898
01:23:07,994 --> 01:23:09,696
But then you knew that,
didn't you?

899
01:23:10,963 --> 01:23:13,833
You had your doubts
about Percival,

900
01:23:13,866 --> 01:23:17,770
and you used me
to shake him down.

901
01:23:17,804 --> 01:23:19,939
Ready when you are.

902
01:23:38,758 --> 01:23:40,102
Hey, hey...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

903
01:23:40,126 --> 01:23:41,961
Whoa, whoa.
It's me. It's me.

904
01:23:53,405 --> 01:23:54,941
He's dead.

905
01:23:54,974 --> 01:23:57,143
Spyglass is dead.

906
01:23:59,779 --> 01:24:01,580
And you are alive.

907
01:24:04,016 --> 01:24:05,985
They're all listening to me.

908
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,256
They knew.

909
01:24:11,758 --> 01:24:13,893
The KGB knew everything.

910
01:24:15,261 --> 01:24:17,196
I need to get across.

911
01:24:19,131 --> 01:24:20,633
Jan.

912
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:04,276
Well, I expected more
out of the Brits

913
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:06,913
- than a royal goat fuck.
- I know. We're sorry.

914
01:25:06,946 --> 01:25:08,247
Oh, no, wait.
You lot don't have

915
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,782
your own private
Stasi agent, do you?

916
01:25:09,816 --> 01:25:12,952
Not one with
a photographic memory.

917
01:25:20,326 --> 01:25:22,161
We need to get with Broughton

918
01:25:22,194 --> 01:25:23,763
and get on the same page.

919
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:26,098
We need that list...
now more than ever.

920
01:25:27,466 --> 01:25:29,101
Broughton?

921
01:25:30,202 --> 01:25:31,738
She made it out.

922
01:25:33,305 --> 01:25:34,506
Right.

923
01:25:36,976 --> 01:25:41,814
You know, a beautiful Italian
girl once said to me, "David...

924
01:25:41,848 --> 01:25:44,116
you can't unfuck
what's been fucked."

925
01:25:46,085 --> 01:25:48,485
Women are always getting in the
way of progress, aren't they?

926
01:25:52,391 --> 01:25:53,893
What no one in Germany

927
01:25:53,926 --> 01:25:55,203
believed possible
has happened tonight.

928
01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:58,230
The wall is coming down.
The wall is down.

929
01:25:58,264 --> 01:26:01,868
People here have lived
with the wall since 1961,

930
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:05,972
and I think now it's time to...
break the wall down, you know.

931
01:26:06,005 --> 01:26:07,907
The wall is crumbling.

932
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:10,242
The sledgehammers
in the hands of men

933
01:26:10,276 --> 01:26:13,412
not born when it went up
tear into it.

934
01:26:13,445 --> 01:26:15,147
And behind it,

935
01:26:15,181 --> 01:26:17,784
the East German soldiers
tried to stop the tide.

936
01:26:17,817 --> 01:26:19,351
Water cannons were brought out.

937
01:26:19,385 --> 01:26:21,921
But the West Berliners
were determined.

938
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:23,531
One West Berliner
sprayed champagne back.

939
01:26:23,555 --> 01:26:25,191
You know, if I was

940
01:26:25,224 --> 01:26:26,759
to follow you,
I mean, properly...

941
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,296
...you'd never fucking know.

942
01:26:30,329 --> 01:26:32,264
It is the moment

943
01:26:32,298 --> 01:26:34,533
Berliners have waited
28 years for.

944
01:26:34,566 --> 01:26:37,236
Even the East Germans
seem exhilarated.

945
01:26:37,269 --> 01:26:39,371
A symbolic breach
in the structure

946
01:26:39,405 --> 01:26:42,174
that cost hundreds of lives
and separated friends,

947
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:45,544
families and lovers
for decades.

948
01:26:45,577 --> 01:26:48,247
I found a French UHF device

949
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,784
in my coat after Spyglass died.

950
01:26:51,818 --> 01:26:54,353
I now believe it was Percival
who planted it.

951
01:26:54,386 --> 01:26:56,388
Made it look like Lasalle.

952
01:27:19,411 --> 01:27:21,180
Why are you here?

953
01:27:22,581 --> 01:27:24,884
You need to leave Berlin.

954
01:27:26,853 --> 01:27:29,488
Well, when I didn't hear
from you, I got worried.

955
01:27:29,521 --> 01:27:31,858
How naive can you be?

956
01:27:32,992 --> 01:27:35,027
We chose this life, Delphine.

957
01:27:36,262 --> 01:27:37,897
This only ends one way.

958
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:39,798
What are you talking about?

959
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,372
He set us both up.

960
01:27:46,405 --> 01:27:48,841
You have to leave
while you can.

961
01:28:14,133 --> 01:28:15,567
Yes?

962
01:28:15,601 --> 01:28:17,269
Don't underestimate me,
Percival.

963
01:28:17,303 --> 01:28:19,305
Oh, Lasalle,
listen to me very carefully.

964
01:28:19,338 --> 01:28:21,607
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

965
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,642
- You set me up.
- You...

966
01:28:23,675 --> 01:28:25,444
Come on, now.
This is the game.

967
01:28:25,477 --> 01:28:27,446
I know your secrets, David,

968
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:30,216
and I can play this game
better than you think.

969
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:52,204
♪ I'm in the dark,
I'd like to read his mind ♪

970
01:28:56,142 --> 01:29:00,379

976
01:29:22,334 --> 01:29:24,136
Percival is trying

977
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:26,272
to set me up.

978
01:29:26,305 --> 01:29:27,974
Are you surprised?

979
01:29:28,007 --> 01:29:29,675
Not really.

980
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:31,944
These relationships
aren't real.

981
01:29:31,978 --> 01:29:34,981
They're just a means to an end.

982
01:29:35,014 --> 01:29:38,084
When you tell
the truth, you look different.

983
01:29:38,117 --> 01:29:39,718
Your eyes change.

984
01:29:39,751 --> 01:29:41,620
Thanks for the warning.

985
01:29:44,223 --> 01:29:45,591
What do you mean?

986
01:29:45,624 --> 01:29:48,060
I mean,
I better not do it again.

987
01:29:48,094 --> 01:29:49,996
Why?

988
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:52,498
'Cause it's going
to get me killed one day.

989
01:29:56,602 --> 01:29:59,471
There is something
that I need to tell you.

990
01:30:07,546 --> 01:30:09,448
It has to do
with your friend Percival.

991
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,017
- He's...
- Shh.

992
01:30:16,155 --> 01:30:19,591

all the trouble I'll get ♪

993

01:31:49,481 --> 01:31:51,117

1025
01:32:45,504 --> 01:32:48,140
Celebrations continue
in the streets tonight.

1026
01:32:48,174 --> 01:32:49,508
From the moment the first wave

1027
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:51,377
of East Germans crossed
into Berlin,

1028
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:53,179
they have been showered
with champagne

1029
01:32:53,212 --> 01:32:55,481
and cheered by a crowd
of thousands.

1030
01:32:55,514 --> 01:32:59,451
It is clear this will be one
of Berlin's most dramatic days.

1031
01:32:59,485 --> 01:33:02,321
East Berliners are overcome
as they cross the border

1032
01:33:02,354 --> 01:33:04,490
that has been closed to them
for 28 years.

1033
01:33:04,523 --> 01:33:06,258
West Berliners
are chipping away

1034
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:08,827
at the wall that scarred
their city and scaling it.

1035
01:33:24,543 --> 01:33:27,646
There is no more
interference from the police.

1036
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:29,748
Unified, Berliners
lay symbols of peace.

1037
01:33:29,781 --> 01:33:32,484
Thousands of them looking east
and chanting,

1038
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:33,819
"Down with the wall."

1039
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,345
There's only one question
left to ask.

1040
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:02,948
Who won?

1041
01:34:02,981 --> 01:34:05,584
And what was
the fucking game anyway?

1042
01:34:06,885 --> 01:34:08,487
And I was thinking,

1043
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,289
the wall will never fall.

1044
01:34:10,322 --> 01:34:11,866
Germany's peaceful revolution

1045
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:14,660
is probably the political
and cultural story of 1989.

1046
01:34:14,693 --> 01:34:16,733
We're going to take a
quick break, but we'll be back

1047
01:34:16,762 --> 01:34:18,330
with an in-depth look
at the number-one

1048
01:34:18,364 --> 01:34:19,974
musical controversy
of the year... sampling.

1049
01:34:19,998 --> 01:34:22,268
Is it art,
or is it just plagiarism?

1050
01:34:22,301 --> 01:34:23,635
Don't go away.

1051
01:34:30,576 --> 01:34:34,346
To win, first you have to know
whose side you're on.

1052
01:34:40,919 --> 01:34:43,322
In our line of work,

1053
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:45,391
that's right up there
with black holes

1054
01:34:45,424 --> 01:34:47,726
or "to be or not to be."

1055
01:34:49,528 --> 01:34:51,363
You fight the good fight,
and then one day

1056
01:34:51,397 --> 01:34:53,465
you wake up and you realize
that all you were

1057
01:34:53,499 --> 01:34:55,000
was Satan's little helper.

1058
01:35:15,421 --> 01:35:17,022
Ironic.

1059
01:35:17,055 --> 01:35:21,627
The news will tell them
there will be no more secrets.

1060
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:25,964
But you and I,
we both know that's not true.

1061
01:35:25,997 --> 01:35:29,968
The world is run on secrets.

1062
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:38,444
Whoever has that list
has power.

1063
01:35:38,477 --> 01:35:41,980
And without it, you're just
another fucking target.

1064
01:35:48,787 --> 01:35:50,322
So, what have I learned

1065
01:35:50,356 --> 01:35:52,324
after all this time?

1066
01:35:52,358 --> 01:35:54,826
After all
the sleepless nights,

1067
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:58,564
lying to friends,
lovers, myself?

1068
01:35:58,597 --> 01:36:01,533
Playing this crooked game
in this crooked town

1069
01:36:01,567 --> 01:36:04,703
filled with backstabbers
and four-faced liars?

1070
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:06,538
I'll tell you
what I've learned.

1071
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:09,675
One thing and one thing only.

1072
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:12,511
I fucking love Berlin!

1073
01:36:37,536 --> 01:36:39,638
You didn't have to kill her.

1074
01:36:39,671 --> 01:36:41,940
You what... what...
you suddenly decided

1075
01:36:41,973 --> 01:36:45,143
to develop a conscience
after all you've done?

1076
01:36:45,176 --> 01:36:48,447
Have you noticed
how everyone you get close to

1077
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,048
ends up fucking dead?

1078
01:36:50,081 --> 01:36:53,419
You gave Bremovych
the details of the plan.

1079
01:36:53,452 --> 01:36:58,089
You went to the KGB
to take me out.

1080
01:36:58,123 --> 01:37:00,926
You were too fucking scared
to do it yourself.

1081
01:37:00,959 --> 01:37:04,630
Too smart, more like.

1082
01:37:04,663 --> 01:37:07,098
If those KGB pricks
had done their part,

1083
01:37:07,132 --> 01:37:11,069
I'd be on my way to a hand job
with the queen by now.

1084
01:37:11,102 --> 01:37:13,472
I've read that list,

1085
01:37:13,505 --> 01:37:15,507
Lorraine.

1086
01:37:17,843 --> 01:37:19,911
And you feature heavily.

1087
01:37:19,945 --> 01:37:23,415
Turns out you've been
a very naughty girl.

1088
01:37:25,851 --> 01:37:28,420
Spyglass was a liability
to us all.

1089
01:37:28,454 --> 01:37:30,021
I couldn't risk
leaving him with you.

1090
01:37:30,055 --> 01:37:32,458
Where's the list, David?

1091
01:37:32,491 --> 01:37:34,660
I don't have it.

1092
01:37:34,693 --> 01:37:36,895
It's en route to MI6,
where it belongs.

1093
01:37:53,111 --> 01:37:56,047
Are you going to lie
till the very end?

1094
01:38:02,087 --> 01:38:05,457
Truth and lies.

1095
01:38:05,491 --> 01:38:07,493
People like us
don't know the difference.

1096
01:38:07,526 --> 01:38:10,028
No, we know the difference,
David.

1097
01:38:10,061 --> 01:38:12,664
We choose to ignore it.

1098
01:38:13,965 --> 01:38:16,568
Isn't that right,
Comrade Satchel?

1099
01:38:18,069 --> 01:38:20,572
So that's how
you'll make it work.

1100
01:38:20,606 --> 01:38:23,542
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

1101
01:38:23,575 --> 01:38:25,143
Well played.

1102
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,462
You killed David Percival?

1103
01:38:47,032 --> 01:38:49,100
All the paperwork
is in order for the bodies

1104
01:38:49,134 --> 01:38:52,037
of James Gascoigne
and David Percival.

1105
01:38:54,906 --> 01:38:56,942
You killed
our head of station,

1106
01:38:56,975 --> 01:38:59,144
an officer of the Crown.

1107
01:38:59,177 --> 01:39:02,113
You'd better have hard proof
and a damn good explanation.

1108
01:39:02,147 --> 01:39:03,915
Who are you
to judge my actions?

1109
01:39:03,949 --> 01:39:05,851
I'm your superior.

1110
01:39:12,057 --> 01:39:14,059
My superior.

1111
01:39:16,161 --> 01:39:18,864
This was never
about stopping the war.

1112
01:39:18,897 --> 01:39:21,700
It was about saving your ass.

1113
01:39:21,733 --> 01:39:25,537
You couldn't bear
the embarrassment of the sins

1114
01:39:25,571 --> 01:39:28,540
that we committed
in the Cold War.

1115
01:39:28,574 --> 01:39:31,543
And I was stupid enough
to give my life for it.

1116
01:39:31,577 --> 01:39:34,613
Yes, well,
that's your job, isn't it?

1117
01:39:34,646 --> 01:39:35,881
I did my job.

1118
01:39:40,085 --> 01:39:44,556
Despite your best efforts
and your incompetence,

1119
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:47,192
I succeeded where you failed.

1120
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:52,097
I uncovered your traitor,
Satchel.

1121
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:55,233
Brought him the only justice
he deserved.

1122
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,606
A bullet.

1123
01:40:01,807 --> 01:40:03,274
Percival meeting with Bremovych

1124
01:40:03,308 --> 01:40:05,777
the day before Spyglass
was killed.

1125
01:40:05,811 --> 01:40:07,789
Maybe we could make

1126
01:40:07,813 --> 01:40:09,347
some sort of, uh, arrangement.

1127
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:11,349
You got to know
that I'm the only man

1128
01:40:11,382 --> 01:40:13,351
in this town that can
help you get that list.

1129
01:40:13,384 --> 01:40:15,787
Very impressive. Dedication.

1130
01:40:15,821 --> 01:40:18,590
Loyalty.
They're rare things these days.

1131
01:40:18,624 --> 01:40:19,991
"It's a double pleasure

1132
01:40:20,025 --> 01:40:21,860
to deceive the deceiver."

1133
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:28,634
We have a deal?

1134
01:40:31,136 --> 01:40:32,237
What about the British?

1135
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:34,606
Do you trust Gray?

1136
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,341
- No.
- What about C?

1137
01:40:36,374 --> 01:40:37,843
C is an arrogant lapdog

1138
01:40:37,876 --> 01:40:39,611
who understands
precisely fuck-all

1139
01:40:39,645 --> 01:40:41,947
