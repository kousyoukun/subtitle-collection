Lorraine, you're the subject of this debriefing.

327
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,750
但你不是管事的  我明白
Not it's controller. I understand.

328
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,620
我当时在柏林
I was there in Berlin.

329
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,780
我在此全权代表中情局
And I'm here with the full executive authority of Langley.

330
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,190
本来为了让你好受一点

331
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,900
我可以和他们一起躲到玻璃后面
I could stand behind the mirror with everybody else.

332
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,020
不巧那边挤了点
But it's a little crowded there.

333
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,760
婊子养的
Cock sucker..

334
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,700
你说什么?
What did you say?

335
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,540
没说什么
I didn't say anything.

336
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
洛林 你刚说什么了?
I'm sorry, did you say something, Lorraine?

337
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,550
你听见我说什么了?  我知道你说了
Did your hear me say something? I thought you said something.

338
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,170
她说什么了?
What did she say?

339
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,370
啊?
What?

340
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,840
额..
Now...

341
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,480
你可以把录像带倒回去听听啊
Do you want to play the tape back?

342
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,080
好吧
Well then.

343
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,590
我们可以开始了吗
Shall we begin?

344
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,020
柏林那边
Berlin.

345
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,060
到底发生了什么事?
What happened?

346
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,740
是啊
And...

347
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,770
柏林
Hm, Berlin...

348
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,770
妈的
Fuck..

349
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,240
你好 洛林
Ah, Lorraine,

350
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,970
抱歉这么着急把你叫来
Sorry to bring you in a such short notice.

351
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,610
你认识C首长吧?
You know C.

352
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,560
认识  我们刚刚看了你的档案
Yes. We were just going over your file.

353
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,670
知道你俄语很棒
I see your Russian is excellent.

354
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,710
懂得如何脱身
You expert in escape and evasion.

355
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,140
精通情报收集

356
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,930
擅长近身肉搏战
and hand to hand combat.

357
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,820
你所掌握的技能真是让人印象深刻啊
It is an impressive set of skills.

358
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,920
跟我一样 很了解苏联人
Knowing the Reds as I do,

359
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,890
想完成任务她得使出浑身解数了
she'll need to use every damn one of them.

360
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,320
那我就直接切入主题了
I will get straight to the point

361
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
你对詹姆斯.加斯科涅了解多少?
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

362
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,540
知道一点
Enough to say hello.

363
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,640
我们85年在伊斯坦布尔一起工作过
We worked together in Istanbul in 85.

364
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,370
他死了
He is dead.

365
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,320
他昨晚在柏林执行任务时被杀害
Gascoigne was killed last night on a mission in Berlin.

366
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,350
今天早上西德警察把他的尸体从河里打捞出来
West German police fished his body out of the street this morning.

367
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,250
并且从他身体里取出一枚7.62毫米的托卡列夫手枪子弹
And the coronary extracted a 7.62 mm Tokarev round...

368
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,590
刺穿头骨
From the base of the skull.

369
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,130
苏联人干的
Soviets..

370
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,950
昨天加斯科涅会见了一位斯塔西的军官
Yesterday.. Gascoigne met with a Stasi officer,

371
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,040
代号"小望远镜"
code named Spyglass.

372
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,540
我们承诺给小望远镜提供豁免权,以此来交换一个缩微胶卷中的文件
We promised Spyglass immunity in exchange for a document on microfilm..

373
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,160
我们称它为“名单”
Codenamed "The list".

374
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,190
这份名单藏在一个瑞士手表里
Hidden in a Swiss watch.

375
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,470
名单上有所有秘密活跃的官员名字
The list contains every active clandestine officer.

376
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,170
和所有见不得人的交易
All the shady deals..

377
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,220
信息量极大
It's an atomic bomb of information

378
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,140
足以让冷战再延续四十年
that could extend the cold war for another forty years,

379
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,660
我们认为现在名单在杀害加斯科涅的那个杀手手里
And we believe that the man that killed Gascoigne, now has it.

380
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,180
我们的消息来源指向尤里·巴赫金
Our sources point to Yuri Bakhtin,

381
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,000
此人是克格勃机构的头牌杀手 手上有几十条人命
KGB hatchet man with more than a dozen confirmed kills.

382
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,640
所以你要派我去莫斯科?
So, you want me in Moscow?

383
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,620
不
No.

384
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,550
巴赫金并没上飞机
Bakhtin never got on the flight.

385
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,000
所以他和那个名单都还在柏林
So he's still in Berlin along with the list.

386
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,080
所有人都在找他 美国佬和法国方面
Everyone is hunting for it, the Yankees, the Frogs.

387
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,930
苏联方面  当然还有我们的人 珀西瓦尔
Soviets, and Cruzes.. And our man, Percival

388
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,050
珀西瓦尔是谁?  大卫·珀西瓦尔
Who is Percival? David Percival.

389
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,450
他是我们在柏林的一号特工
He is our number one in Berlin.

390
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,510
也是你的联络人
He is your point of contact.

391
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,870
这可是上好的香水
Straight from the teat of the Virgin Mary.

392
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,640
搞到这东西不容易
Jordache wasn't easy.

393
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,210
这是我给我妻子准备的生日礼物
It's for my wife's birthday.

394
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,890
很好 现在告诉我名单在哪里
That's very nice, now where is that fucking list?

395
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,460
我昨晚把胶片给加斯科涅了
I gave the microfilm to Gascoigne last night.

396
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,930
他并没有出现
James didn't show up.

397
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,530
我已经做了我该做的 把名单给他了
I did my part I gave him the list.

398
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,500
你必须把我和我家人送走 我们在这里不安全
You have to get me and my family across this. Not safe for us anymore here.

399
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,850
俄国人盯上我了
The Russian's are onto me.

400
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,960
没有名单 免谈
No list, no deal.

401
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,230
我可是豁出去了啊  没有名单 免谈
I risked everything. No list, no deal..

402
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,600
听着小望远镜 没拿到名单
You listen to me Spyglass without that list...

403
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,180
我完全可以把你拉出去一枪毙了你
Why shouldn't I take you outside and shoot you in the fucking head?

404
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,170
你敢杀一名斯塔西官员?
You are going to kill a stasi officer?

405
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,950
对于你这种要投奔西德的 是的
One that's about to defect to the west, yeah.

406
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,920
没有大使馆照顾
Without an embassy to look after him

407
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,370
珀西瓦尔 什么都要靠自己 和当地人差不多了
Percival has gone somewhat native.

408
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,120
狂傲不逊
And fucking feral,

409
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,080
柏林局势混乱
Berlin is the Wild West.

410
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,720
要是那该死的墙倒塌 我们可不想被埋在下面
If that bloody wall comes crashing down we don't want to be under it.

411
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,310
要是苏联方面得到名单 我们都要被盯上了
If the Russians get that list, we're all bugged.

412
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,020
这就被动了
Side ways.

413
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,960
你的新身份是伊丽莎白·劳埃德
You are Elisabeth Loyd.

to retrieve the body and the effects of their recently deceased son.

416
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,710
你的任务就是找到珀西瓦尔
Your mission is to connect with Percival

417
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,090
不惜一切代价拿回名单
and do whatever it takes to get that list home.

418
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,520
记住 洛林
And remember Lorraine...

419
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,180
这是敏感时期
This is highly sensitive..

420
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,900
不要相信任何人
Trust no one.

424
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,130
都背下来了? 所有人的名字?
You memorized it? Every single agent on that list?

425
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,510
你每周三都会去竹篙巷妓院
Every wednesday you visit the Penny lane brothel..

Your favorite girl is Margot, her real name is Maria.

427

Alright, I will get you across. You're a good man, Percival.

少废话
Fuck off.

430
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,070
我只想要得到名单 只要我一拿到 哦 妈的

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,750
他们知道我的名字  这就麻烦了
They knew my name. That's troubling.

464
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,220
还有你的名字  哇哦,出乎意料
And yours. Probably surprising.

465
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,940
真是个不错的开始 珀西瓦尔
Great fucking start, Percival.

466
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,290
你对他的第一印象如何?
Well what was your first impression?

467
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,900
你说大卫吗?
Of David?

468
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,260
他很帅 三十几岁
He was handsome, late thirties.

469
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,380
有着和奥康纳一样的头发
Disastrous Sinnade O'Connor hair.

470
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,180
那是个爱尔兰歌手
Irish singer.

471
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,320
我问他在那里如何生存
I asked him what the deal was and he said...

472
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,880
他说尽量融入当地人的生活
Is to blend in.

473
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,790
你想摸摸吗?
You wanna touch it?

474
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,410
让自己看起来像当地人一样
To blend in the east.

475
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,380
我当时正沿着门口跑
I was running by gate by the way. I mean, how the fuck,

476
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,240
那些犹太人怎么会认为你会帮我找回名单?
does the Jews think that you're gonna be able to help me find that list?

477
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,310
只要你去认领加斯科涅的尸体
As soon as you pick up Gascoingne's body,

478
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,430
他们就会注销你的护照 明天用第一班飞机把你遣送出境
They will null and void your visa and you'll be on the first flight back home.

479
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,680
我自有办法   那是查利检查站
I'll figure it out. That's Checkpoint Charlie.

480
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,950
我办公室就在那边
My office is back there.

481
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,980
我不是来这儿搜集明信片的
I'm not here to collect postcards, Percival.

482
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,170
我的酒店就转角处 在那下车
Just drop me at my hotel, it's around the corner.

483
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,640
你不是说你之前没来过柏林吗?
I thought you said you had never been to Berlin before.

484
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,300
难道我不会看地图吗?
I can read a fucking map!

485
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,620
一分钟就看懂地图了
That will just take a minute.

486
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,460
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

487
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,740
给法西斯猪一个警告
Sending a message to a fascist pig.

488
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,170
替我向布雷莫维奇同志问好
Say hello to Comrade Bremovych for me.

489
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,220
今晚的柏林高度警戒
Tensions are high in East Berlin tonight,

490
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,040
因为公民抗议行为势头不减
as civil disobedience continues to build momentum.

491
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,230
警方用催泪瓦斯和水枪镇压示威人群
These berlin youth leaders shout out their protest..

492
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,430
这些柏林青年仍然大声表达自己的抗议
Through tear gas and water cannons

493
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,960
并有多起报道说警察
and there are numerous reports of police

494
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,430
用警棍殴打和平示威者
beating peaceful demonstrators with batons.

495
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,840
我是来取一位英国公民的尸体的
I have been sent to arrange the return of a British subject.

496
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,620
尸体是通过身体组织鉴定的
The body was identified by a tissue.

497
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,140
我相信
Yes. I believe so.

498
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,000
这不是一个问题
This was not a question.

499
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,830
这是个声明
It was a statement.

500
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
他是你同事?
He was your colleague?

501
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,840
不在同一部门
Different department.

502
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,680
他是哪个部门的  不是跟我一个部门的
Which department? A different one.

503
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,450
你有转移尸体的授权书吗?
Do you have the transfer papers?

504
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,090
你们知道那些电影吗 画面渐渐慢下来
Do you know those movies where the picture just starts to slow down...

505
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,650
融化
and melt..

506
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,670
然后燃烧
Then get fire...

507
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,140
哇
Wow...

508
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,820
柏林的日子就像那种电影一样
That's Berlin.

509
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,240
护照号码是错的
The passport number is incorrect.

510
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,230
如果不提供准确信息的话我是不会让你带走尸体的
I will not release this body without the right information.

511
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,900
这个错误没什么大不了的
It's a simple mistake.

512
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,300
罗伊德女士 在德国 我们从不会犯这种低级的错误
Miss Loyd, in Germany we don't make simple mistakes.

513
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,020
我实话实说 你让我吃了一惊
I am not gonna lie. I'm impressed.

514
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,900
敢跑到我这来 胆子得够大
You have got some balls breaking in here!

515
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,630
那你得看看我的蛋蛋 你会更吃惊的
You should see my balls then you will be really impressed.

516
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,440
我记住你这句话了
I will take your word for it.

517
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,490
我知道你找到了留在德国的办法
I see you've found a way to stay,

518
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,900
你把16天的签证时长改成了76天
You are at 16 when you feel it's 76.

519
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,210
没错
That's right.

520
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,540
我哪儿也不去
I am not going anywhere.

521
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,030
我至少在这呆一周
I'm here for at least another week.

522
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,000
我他妈的太幸运了
Lucky fucking me.

523
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,830
他们现在是不会交出尸体的 除非他们解开谜团 找到真相
They won't release his body now, till they investigated that right through a nightmare.

524
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,860
你到底怎么进来的?
How the fuck did you get in here?

525
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,570
我呆在柏林很久了 我应该认识几乎所有还不错的宾馆
You know, I've been in Berlin a long time, and I think I know every doormen..

526
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,090
的看门人
Of every decent shithouse

527
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,450
还有柏林墙两边还算不错的妓院
borderlined decent brothels on both sides of the wall.

528
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,060
那你肯定认识小望远镜
Well then you must know Spyglass.

529
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,990
我从来没见过他
Never met the fella.

530
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,460
他是詹姆斯的人
He was James'

531
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,670
从机场就一直跟着我的那个女人 你了解她的情况吗?
What do you know about this woman who's been following me since Templehof?

532
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,360
我不得不说 你真的太有魅力
I'd say that you're an attractive woman...

533
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,080
然后你得自己想想为什么了
and you should do the math.

534
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,560
你知道的如果是我跟踪你 我说认真的
You know, if I was to follow you, I mean, properly

535
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,090
你永远不会发现
you'd never fuckin know.

536
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,920
跟踪是有技巧的
There's a knack to it, isn't there?

537
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,440
就像走钢丝 吹风笛一样
It's like walking a tightrope or playing the bagpipes.

538
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,860
你可能很快就轻车熟路 也可能一辈子都学不会
You can either do it, or you can't.

539
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,110
随便你
Knock yourself out.

540
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,570
我想买块表
I'd like to purchase a watch.

541
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,810
我需要获取东德情报网的权限
I need access to a network in East Berlin.

542
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,340
明天关门之前再来
Come back tomorrow before closing.

543
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,540
尽管共产党官员尽力维持秩序
East Berlin.. Is on a short fuse again tonight,

544
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,730
但今晚东德再一次举行游行示威
as communist party officials struggled to maintain order.

545
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,890
你了解詹姆斯多少?
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

546
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,370
他死了
He is dead.

547
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,930
验尸官在头盖骨底部
The coronary extracted a 7.62mm Tokarev

548
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,370
取出7.62毫米托卡列夫手枪子弹
around in the base of his skull.

549
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,750
苏联人干的
Soviets

550
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,420
我们知道萨切尔是谁
We know who Satchel is.

551
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,910
我们必须离开
We need to run.

552
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,270
你想在加斯科涅的公寓里找到名单吗?
You expected to find the list in Gascoigne's apartment?

553
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,820
你没有意识到你已经太迟了吗?
You realized you were late to the party?

554
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,020
珀西瓦尔还有那些俄罗斯人肯定已经抢先搜查过了
Percival, the Russians, everybody must have already ransacked the place.

555
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,790
是的
Yes.

556
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,730
我们的问题不只是那份名单
But the list wasn't our only problem.

557
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,620
我去柏林之前 你还告诉过我一件事
Before I left, you told me one last thing.

558
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,220
这就是我为什么我不希望中情局的人在场
This is exactly why I didn't want the CIA present.

559
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,650
小望远镜透露 这份名单
Spyglass revealed that this list..

560
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,400
会使一个代号为萨切尔的双重间谍暴露身份
Would expose a double agent by the name of Satchel.

561
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,810
无论是死是活 我要见到萨切尔
I want Satchel, dead or alive.

562
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,080
这个叛徒多年来都是我们的眼中钉
This traitor's been a thorn in our side for years.

563
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,600
他败坏了我们的名声
He is a black eye to the Crown.

564
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,270
这也是军情六处有史以来最大的一起情报泄露案件
And the single biggest intelligence leak in MI6 history.

565
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,170
你必须得找到这个叫萨切尔的混蛋
You expose this bastard Satchel.

566
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,830
要不然我们就判决你犯下叛国罪 执行绞刑
We'll hang you for treason.

567
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,210
然后你就可能发现自己坐在白金汉宫喝茶
You might find yourself taking tea in Buckingham Palace.

568
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,260
所以
So no.

569
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,900
我并不只是在加斯科涅的公寓里找那份名单
I wasn't just looking for the list in Gascoigne's apartment.

570
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,430
前进 把她抓回来
Go ahead, bring her back.

571
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,130
小心点
Take action.!

572
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,560
我和珀西瓦尔对合作的定义明显不一样
Percival and I seem to have a different definition for collaboration.

573
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,920
在第三层  快上楼
In the third floor. Quickly the stairs!

574
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,860
这是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

575
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,570
只有他知道我去了加斯科涅的公寓
He was the only one who knew I was going to Gascoigne's apartment.

576
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,440
如果我发现他报警了
If I knew he was going to call the police,

577
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,420
我会换身装束
I would have worn a different outfit.

578
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,320
换身装束..
Different outfit...

579
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,860
快点 我看到了
Quick. I saw something.

580
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,430
喂!站住!
Hey! halt!

581
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,240
街上出现了越来越多追求改变的呼声
With repeated calls for change on the streets

582
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,760
这使示威者更加有信心
and the protestors going ever more confident..

583
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,280
留给东德政府的时间已经不多了
Time is running out for the east German governtment.

584
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,800
人们普遍认为 由共产党执政的局面
Popular opinion has it that the Communist.

585
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,750
不会持续太久
Claim to leadership can't be upheld much longer.

586
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,380
如果还没有改变
And if rapid change is not forthcoming..

587
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,580
那么今天相对平静的抗议
Today's relatively calm protest..

588
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,690
就会是暴风雨前的宁静
Could be seen as the calm before the storm.

589
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,030
人们要求的不仅是换一个新的领导人
It's not just new faces that recalled for..

590
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,570
或许还想彻底拆除柏林墙
But perhaps a complete demolition of the wall.

591
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,490
外套给我吧
Let me take your coat.

592
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,100
别太拘束
Make yourself at home..

593
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,410
我的天
Fucking yeah!

594
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,900
喝杜松子酒吗?
You want a pair of Jeans?

595
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,860
请自便
Help yourself.

596
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,820
你的图书馆里竟然有拉里·弗林特的色情书
Your library includes Larry Flynt.

597
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,600
言论自由的追求者嘛
Champion of free to speech.

598
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,520
你怎么看巴赫金的?
What did you find on Bakhtin?

599
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,790
如果巴赫金想要俄罗斯人拿到那份名单
Look if Bakhtin.. Wanted the Russians to have that list,

600
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,850
那么现在他早就给他们了
he would have given it to them by now.

601
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,710
你只要等他进一步的活动
You just have to wait for him to make his move.

602
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,240
我等不及了
I can't afford to wait.

603
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,870
珀西瓦尔 这是你的地盘
This is your city, Percival.

604
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,560
但是你居然只认识些看门的和些妓女
But you only know doormen and belhoffs.

605
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,640
所以你在加斯科涅的公寓里找到了什么?
So what did you find in Gascoigne's apartment?

606
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,640
一些标记
Some Doich marks.

607
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,490
空白的护照 签证
Empty passports, visas.

608
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,740
还有几年前你们俩的合照
And a picture of two of you.. together a few years back.

609
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,750
我没说过我们是朋友吗?
Did I not mention that we were friends?

610
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,860
没有  没有?
No. No?

611
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,890
我可能忘说了
I must have forgotten.

612
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,630
那就当我现在告诉你了吧
There you go love.

613
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,380
我要去走走
I'm down for a walk.

614
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,170
我们都在那个名单上
Look, we are all exposed by that list.

615
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,400
拯救世界虽然很酷
Saving the world is cool and all that...

616
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,730
但是我的目标是保住自己的性命
but my main objective is staying alive.

617
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,670
我驻扎德国10年了
I have been held up in Berlin stationed for 10 years,

618
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,830
你要知道我是这里唯一一个能帮你拿到那份名单的人
you have got to know I am the only man in this town who can help you get that list.

619
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,450
没错 我看过你的档案
Yes, I've read your file.

620
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,770
我也看了你的档案
I've also read your DOG file.

621
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,730
那我们就别废话了
So let's cut the crap.. shall we?

622
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,670
你整天喝的酩酊大醉 疯疯癫癫 我不知道你真实的一面是什么样子
This whole hungover, sheer play, don't know which way is up act..

623
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,420
但是我不会轻易上当的
I am not buying it.

624
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,610
到现在为止我还是相信你 但是我也可以随时抛弃你
I trust you but far as I can throw you.

625
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,430
欺骗欺人者 其乐无穷
"It's a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver".

626
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:07,080
你书架上有本尼克洛·马基雅维利的书
Nicola Maquiavelo. It was on your shelf.

627
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,080
天哪 我想我爱上你了  非常遗憾
Oh, my God, I think I fucking love you. That's too bad.

628
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,540
如果关于巴赫金的事 珀西瓦尔说的都是真话
If Percival.. Was telling the truth about Bakhtin,

629
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,830
我得查出俄罗斯人知道了什么
I needed to figure out what the Russians knew.

630
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,840
来一杯斯托尼酒 加冰
Stoney on ice.

631
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,090
我今晚不说德语
I am not speaking German tonight.

632
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,110
所以那你是英国人
So you're British.

633
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,470
我记住你了
Very impressive.

634
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,160
这绝不是你唯一的天赋
This can't be your only talent.

635
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,930
天才是会被高估的
Talents can be overrated.

636
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,340
但能尽心尽力办事又忠心耿耿的人是越来越少见了
But dedication and loyality is very rare these days.

637
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,060
这里的每个人都在找某样东西
Everyone here searching for something.

638
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,180
你在找什么?
What are you looking for?

639
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,500
说了这么多
When all said and done..

640
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,390
你还不如说 我们所有人实际上找得都是同一件东西
Wouldn't you say deep down we're all just searching for the same thing..

641
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,120
我让您一个人呆了会
I leave you alone for only a moment...

642
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,580
您就有仰慕者了?
and already you are attracting admirers.

643
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,760
先生 三个人本来也可以的
Mossier, three is not always a crowd.

644
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,670
但是今晚不行
But tonight it is.

645
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,910
法国小姐 你又来了啊
French women

646
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,100
那这位英国小姐怎么想的呢?
What about the British?

647
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,260
或许我们可以达成一些协议?
Maybe we can make some sort of arrangement?

648
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,230
我们太久没见了
We haven't seen each other in a long time,

649
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,860
所以得好好聊聊
and we really need to catch up.

650
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,310
单独谈谈
Alone.

651
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,420
女士们 柏林是个小地方
Ladies, Berlin is a small place.

652
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,520
我想我们会再见面的
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

653
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,980
抱歉
Sorry.

654
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,500
你看起来需要帮助
You looked like you needed saving.

655
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,330
多谢你的好意 还请问女士你叫?
Well I appreciate the gesture, Miss...?

656
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,600
拉萨尔
Lasalle...

657
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,310
德尔菲娜·拉萨尔
Delphine Lasalle.

658
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,510
很高兴认识你
Pleased to meet you.

659
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,740
所以 德尔菲娜 你是做什么的?
So, what do you do, Delphine?

660
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,360
我是兼职口译者
I am a parttime translator.

661
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,640
但我更想当个诗人
Who really wants to be a poet...

662
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,290
或者是个摇滚巨星
maybe a rock star.

663
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,000
我的朋友在附近有家俱乐部
My friend owns a club nearby.

664
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,080
你想去吗?
Wanna come check it out?

665
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,400
现在?  是啊
Now? Sure.

666
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,220
我不能
I can't.

667
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,740
好吧 反正我给你个地址
Well, I'll give you the address anyway.

668
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,950
明晚在那不见不散
Come meet me there tomorrow night.

669
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,600
你会来吗?
Will you come?

670
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,230
也许吧
Maybe?

671
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,550
你很执着啊
You are relentless.

672
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,050
是啊
Oui..

673
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,970
大卫·哈塞尔霍夫在城里
David Hasselhof is in town.

674
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,290
我们很幸运
Lucky us.

675
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,120
柏林真的完了
Berlin is truly doomed..

676
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,490
你的手表准备好了
Your watch is ready.

677
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,160
在桌上的信封里
It's on that counter, in that plain envelop.

678
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,620
我相信你肯定会觉得我的线人非常棒
I think you will find my contact very useful.

679
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,790
你的手表准备好了
Your watch is ready.

680
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,450
在桌上的信封里
It's on that counter. In that plain envelop.

681
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,040
我相信你肯定会觉得我的线人非常棒
I think you will find my contact very useful.

682
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,640
东德人在本周早些时候
East Berliners stormed the West Germany embassies in

683
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,320
闯进捷克斯洛伐克的西德大使馆
Czechoslovakia early at this week...

684
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,100
现在捷克政府下令 在边境站处
As the Czech government has began to waive the refugees

685
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,470
不必问难民太多问题 尽快放行
through checkpoints with few questions.

686
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,460
公众不禁疑惑 东德政府这样还能持续多久
One has to ask how long the East Berlin government can hold on..

687
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,480
巴赫金和名单还没出现在西德
Bakhtin and the list had not yet surfaced in the west.

688
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,250
我要和我的新线人见面谈谈
I needed to meet my new contact.

689
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,960
看看我在东德到底要对付谁
And see what I was up against in the east.

690
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,280
你应该申请访问资格
You should have applied for a visit experiment.

691
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,470
你从事的是什么工作?
What kind of work do you do?

692
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,460
法律事务
Legal affairs..

693
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,730
如果你在六点之前没回来
If you do not return before 6'o clock..

694
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,360
你就会被逮捕 清楚了吗?
You will be arrested. Did you understand?

695
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,910
我知道了
I understand.

696
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,010
现在我还是不是很相信你的故事
Right now I'm not feeling very confident of this story of yours.

697
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,530
为什么在东德不用珀西瓦尔的线人
Why not use Percival's connections in the East?

698
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,950
你告诉过我
You told me...

699
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,080
不要相信任何一个人
To trust no one.

700
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,590
你好
Hello.

701
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,350
快点 这边!
Go ahead, on the side!

702
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,090
你迟到了
You are late.

703
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,220
还被人跟踪
And you were followed.

704
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,010
我迟到就是因为我被人跟踪了
I'm late because I was followed.

705
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,530
20分钟之前 我在共和国广场附近 刚甩掉他们
I lost them 20 minutes ago near the Piazza della Republic.

706
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,070
你还真有两下子啊
You're as good as your reputation.

707
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,490
你确定在这见面最好吗?
Are you sure this is the best place to meet?

708
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,060
在敌人的眼皮底子下
Keep your enemies close.

709
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,650
最危险的地方就是最安全的地方
I am a permanent fixture for them now.

710
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,560
钟表匠说 这些天在黑市
The watchmaker says there has been great interest in this list..

711
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,000
有很多人对这份名单感兴趣
...In the black market the last few days.

712
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,280
有巴赫金的消息了吗?  没有
Any sign of Bakhtin? No.

713
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,860
这个萨切尔让墙两边的人忧心忡忡
This Satchel character, has people worried on both sides of the wall.

714
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,480
没错
Yeah..

715
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,440
你的情报网怎么样?
What kind of network have you assembled?

716
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,660
在墙的这边
There's a lot of dissatisfied youths...

717
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,660
有很多对他们不满意的年轻人
on this side of the wall.

718
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,510
他们就像
They are like uh...

719
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,560
导火索
Tinder books.

720
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,590
只要你找到正确的火花
If you find the right spark...

721
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,830
继续说
keep talking.

722
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,720
我想卖块表
I am interested in selling a watch.

723
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,130
具体说说看
What are you selling?

724
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,810
它非常贵重
It is extremely valuable...

725
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,030
质量很好
Finest quality and...

726
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,190
还装满了秘密
filled with secrets.

727
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,180
介意我先检查一下货物么?
Would you mind if I inspect the merchandise?

728
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,990
我当然介意
Fuck yes, I mind.

729
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,900
你只要告诉有意愿的买家
Just tell potential buyers...

730
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,750
巴赫金有意出售
Bakhtin is open for business.

731
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:25,330
女士们 柏林是个小地方
Ladies, Berlin is small place.

732
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,700
我想我们会再见面的
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

733
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,170
抱歉
Sorry.

734
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,370
你看起来需要帮助
You looked like you needed saving.

735
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,160
我朋友在附近有家俱乐部
My friend owns a club nereby.

736
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,290
你想来吗?
Wanna come check it out?

737
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,370
我还以为你不会来
I didn't think that you'd show.

738
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,940
斯托尼加冰
Stoney on the rocks.

739
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,460
你记性不错
You pay attention.

740
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:17,470
我喜欢追求细节
I look for pleasure in the details.

741
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,490
既然我们聊的还不错
Speaking of which...

742
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,420
我真想问你个问题
I have been dying to ask you a question..

743
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:42,120
我们去个安静点的地方
Let's go someplace quite.

744
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,000
为什么带着枪 德尔菲娜?
Why the gun, Delphine?

745
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,530
你以为你伪装的很好 但实际上很烂
You're not as well disguised as you may think.

746
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,170
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

747
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,520
你是军情六处的洛林
You are Lorraine Broughton, MI6.

748
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,870
你到这里来就是因为詹姆斯死了
And you are here because of the death of Gascoigne.

749
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,820
关于詹姆斯 你知道些什么事?
What do you know about Gascoigne?

750
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,410
什么也不知道
Nothing.

751
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,020
但是如果有人杀了个盟军的特工
But if someone is killing Allied officers...

752
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,170
我们不都得关注吗?
Shouldn't we all care?

753
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,590
假如人们都愿意
What if it is in that list...?

754
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,110
为了那份名单去厮杀
That's people willing to kill for it.

755
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,860
这是我在法国情报局的第一项任务
It's my first assignment with the French intelligence.

756
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,410
我来这儿只有一年
I've only been here a year.

757
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,980
我害怕了 不行吗?
I'm scared, okay?

758
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,210
当初我接了这项任务是因为觉着很刺激
I got into this because it was exciting,

759
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:06,520
但是没曾想柏林会变成现在这副模样
But it's never been like this in Berlin.

760
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,460
你应该去当一名诗人的
You should have become a poet.

761
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,340
或去做个摇滚明星
Or a rock star.

762
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,710
所以你和一个法国女特工接上头了
So you made contact with the French operative.

763
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,390
是的
Obviously.

764
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,750
为什么?
Why?

765
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,250
我相信她有我可以利用的情报
I believed she had information I could exploit.

766
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,980
没别的原因
Nothing more.

767
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,360
那她有么?
And did she?

768
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,140
她有什么情报吗 洛林?
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

769
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,340
我得告诉你些事
There's something I need to tell you

770
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,140
和你的朋友珀西瓦尔有关
It has to do with your friend Percival.

771
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,350
洛林
Lorraine...

772
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,800
她有提供任何情报吗 洛林?
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

773
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,850
她给过你情报吗?
She gave you information?

774
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:19,820
她什么也没给我
She gave me nothing.

775
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,190
他妈的大卫·珀西瓦尔
David fucking Percival.

776
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,200
你跟踪我?
Are you following me?

777
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,140
你他妈还以为自己间谍当的挺好的吧
Maybe you're not as good at this spy shit as you think.

778
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,330
这下是替詹姆斯捅的 你这杂种
That was for James, you fucking prick.

779
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,280
现在把那份该死的名单给我
Now gimme that fucking list.

780
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,130
我们得告诉你一个消息 洛林
We needed to get you a message, Lorraine.

781
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,460
几天过去了 你一点线索都没有
There are several days on to a mission without a single lead.

782
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,860
还旁生许多枝节
And plenty of distractions.

783
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,870
我们必须提醒你发生这些事情的原因
We had to remind you of the cause it had.

784
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,060
哦 我收到你们的消息了
Oh. I received your message.

785
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,990
从这看挺壮观的
That's quite a view.

786
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,880
70英里的铁丝网
70 miles of barbed wire,

787
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,090
310个警戒塔 65条反装甲战壕
310 guard towers, 65 antivehicle trenches,

788
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:51,290
4万名训练有素全副武装的苏联边防军
40,000 Soviet trained heavily armed frontier troops.

789
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,350
面对这些
All that... and...

790
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,600
居然还有5千多名东德人敢外逃
five thousand GDR citizens still had the brass balls to escape.

791
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,150
你可没少让军情六处操心
You have got the MI6 a worry...

792
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,400
他们甚至找了CIA来帮你
They called the CIA to talk sense into you.

793
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,150
埃里克·格雷给我打了电话
Eric Gray called me.

794
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,610
他当然会打给你的
Of course he did.

795
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,880
不用我多说 你也知道时间紧迫吧
I don't have to remind you of how fast the clock is ticking.

796
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,580
一旦名单曝光
If that thing gets out...

797
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,680
很多辛勤工作的人
a lot of good hard working folks...

798
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,000
不论男女 都会因此而死
brave men and women, are gonna show up dead.

799
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,500
包括你我
You and I included.

800
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,570
我发誓 这几周
I swear to god the last few weeks..

801
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:30,320
我甚至每天早上一睁开眼就感到恐惧
I dreaded even waking up in the morning.

802
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,710
我知道形势很严峻
I understand the severity of the situations,

803
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,670
时间也很紧迫
and time imperative.

804
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,330
听着 我大老远过来可不是为了给你加油助威的
Listen, I didn't climb all the way up here just to give you some arousing pep talk..

805
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,750
我就直接说重点吧
So I'll cut to the chase.

806
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,200
你昨晚遇到的那个女的
Last night you met a woman.

807
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,430
德尔菲娜·拉萨尔那点儿本事在这可不够看
Delphine Lasalle is out of her depth.

808
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:57,130
在现在的形势下 我可不希望看到任务执行失败
Given the climate I hate to see an executive order come down the line

809
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,600
不过她可一点也不在乎这个
that falls in her disinterest.

810
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,470
她不在乎?
Her disinterest?

811
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,130
你说她不在乎是什么意思?
What do you mean her disinterest?

812
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,610
这还需要问? 洛林 你能不知道我是什么意思?
Don't insult my intelligence Lorrain. You know exactly what the fuck I mean.

813
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,280
希望你拍张照片留念
Hope you get a snapshot.

814
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,840
下周这儿可就天翻地覆喽
Next week, this will be a whole different picture.

815
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,630
萨切尔已经暴露了
Satchel has been compromised.

816
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,620
到奥兰尼亚街的同性恋酒吧见一面吧
Meet me at the Rough Trade Bar, Oraniastrasse.

817
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,240
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

818
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,100
看看隐于夜生活的柏林的另一面
Look at all these hiddenness.

819
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,790
就像个疯狂的美女 我他妈太喜欢这儿了
It's like a beautiful women gone wrong. I fucking love it.

820
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,740
听说巴赫金又出现了
Word is Bakhtin has resurfaced.

821
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,880
警察发现他脑袋上被开了个洞
Cops found him with a homemade lobotomy.

822
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,350
不管怎么样 我们都得解决小望远镜的问题
Either way, we have to deal with Spyglass.

823
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,910
好好想想 他那边也没多少时间了
Thinking it through, he doesn't have much time over there.

824
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,890
我们的首要任务是找到那份名单
Our priority is the list.

825
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,740
我们不能犯错  拜托!
We can't make mistakes. Come on!

826
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,650
我的天 他是我认识的最值得信赖的人 我很少遇到像他这样的
He is hardly the most trustworthy person I've ever met, all the fucking Christ

827
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,900
等下 你说你从来没见过他
Wait, you said you hadn't met him.

828
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,510
我撒谎了
I lied.

829
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,420
他声称 他已经把整张名单都背下来了
And he claimes.. To have memorized the entire list.

830
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,560
他准备叛逃
He is ready to make the jump.

831
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,930
你相信他能记住所有的内容?
You believe he comitted the entire thing to memory?

832
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,730
是的 一字不差
Everything.

833
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:43,590
早知道是这样 我会把小望远镜放在任务首位
Had I known earlier I would have prioritized Spyglass.

834
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:47,140
这就意味着 他和那份名单同样重要了
His knowledge made him as valuable as the list.

835
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,260
我们本可以随时带走小望远镜的
We could have grabbed him at any time.

836
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:51,530
就因为珀西瓦尔一直不告诉我这个情况
Instead Percival kept it a secret,

837
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,700
使我们处于危险境地
putting us in a precarious position.

838
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:04,450
克格勃会派出手下
Look the KGB are gonna have some very angry bastards out there...

839
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,380
四处寻找小望远镜的下落
...looking for Spyglass.

840
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,010
我们不能按照老规矩或老办法来办这事
We can't trust any of the old rules or methods.

841
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,500
这几天想坐车越境也不是那么难
It's not that difficult to drive across the border these days.

842
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,580
如果你跟小望远镜一样被通缉 越境就难了
It is when you are wanted like Spyglass is!

843
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:18,460
我们必须在光天化日之下 亲自带他走过边境以确保其安全
We have to walk him across personally to ensure his safety in plain sight

844
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,570
我们要利用明天在亚历山大广场举行的示威游行
We'll use the demonstration tomorrow at the alexanderplatz in plain sight

845
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:24,910
你简直是疯了  那些示威者们会帮我们分散敌人的注意力
That's insane. All those Protestants will make a great distraction.

846
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,210
小望远镜是由我负责的 我们得按照我的方法去做
Spyglass is my guy. We're gonna do it my way.

847
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:32,940
好吧
Fine..

848
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,550
但是得用我的关系网搞到越境所需的文件
But we use my contact to get all ours papers are in order.

849
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,400
可以
Alright.

850
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,020
说定了吗?
We have a deal?

851
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,930
不说话我当你同意了
I'll take that as a yes.

852
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,460
你要知道
You see...

853
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,480
那晚我接到了帕西瓦尔的电话 洛林
I received a call from David Percival, that evening, Lorraine.

854
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,420
他说他得到了那份名单
He said he had the list.

855
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,280
给我点时间 让我理解一下
I will need a little time to wrap it up.

856
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,520
他知道萨切尔的真实身份
...and he knew the identity of Satchel.

857
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,560
我已非常接近萨切尔了
Oh, I'm very close to Satchel.

858
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,540
居然没人想告诉我这些?
And no one thought to tell me?

859
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,060
妈的
Fuck!

860
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,620
你带了这么多人来啊
You brought a lot of friends.

861
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,030
我听说巴赫金出了点儿小意外
I heard Bakhtin had a little accident.

862
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,860
我听说他滑倒摔在了一个冰锥上
I heard he slipped and fell on an ice pick.

863
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,560
柏林像是个残忍的女人
Berlin is a cruel mistress.

864
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,030
尤其是对像巴赫金这样的叛徒
Especially for traitors like Bakhtin.

865
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:17,590
别跟我来共产党那一套 你有麻烦了
Don't be such a fucking communist, you have got a problem.

866
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,000
是的 我知道
Yeah I know.

867
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,500
那份名单在你手上
You have the fucking list.

868
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,210
我们敌对了这么久 都应该知道
We've been in the trenches long enough to know that

869
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:27,780
如今这世道 柏林有她自己的一套规则
in times like these, Berlin, has its own set of rules.

870
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,630
我可以给你情报
I can give you information...

871
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,820
可以保证双方处于制衡状态
that will keep the balance.

872
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,480
你现在到底跟不跟我合作
Now, are you in or out?

873
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,290
帕西瓦尔想陷害我
Percival is trying to set me up...

874
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,570
你很惊讶?
Are you surprised?

875
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,800
并不是
Not really.

876
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,820
特工之间的合作不过是虚与委蛇
These relationships aren't real.

877
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,620
只是为完成任务的手段罢了
They are just a means to an end.

878
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:04,170
当你讲真话时 你看起来不一样了
When you tell the truth, you look different.

879
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:06,560
你的眼神变了
Your eyes change.

880
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,280
谢谢你提醒我
Thanks for the warning.

881
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:15,510
什么意思?  我的意思是我不会再犯这样的错了
What do you mean? I mean I better not do it again.

882
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,550
为什么?
Why?

883
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:29,260
因为将来有一天 我可能会为之丧命
Because it's going to get me killed one day.

884
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,230
哇哦 不错哦
Well, I'm impressed.

885
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:53,510
我还以为默克尔没什么本事呢
Thought Merkel out here was just a good bartender.

886
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,450
你闻起来就像是个斯塔西特工
You smell like a Stasi officer.

887
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,380
刮掉胡子
Shave off the mustache.

888
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,650
用西德产的香皂和香水
Use the soap and colognes from the west.

889
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,900
东德这边的东西你都不能带走
You can't take anything from the east.

890
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,960
默克尔会给你拿些衣服
Merkel will give you some clothes.

891
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,360
这边走 小望远镜先生
Right this way Mr. Spyglass.

892
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,740
这本应该很容易的
It should have been easy.

893
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,830
计划很周全
Plan was sound..

894
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:05,160
无论是哪出了差错 肯定是有人故意为之
Whatever went wrong did so because someone wanted it to.

895
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,770
而且罪魁祸首还是内部人员
Someone from the inside.

896
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,920
你是被自己人出卖了
You were betrayed by a fellow agent.

897
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:11,010
你说的是萨切尔
You mean Satchel.

898
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,680
这种事又不是没发生过
Would that be unheard off?

899
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,480
根据您的要求
As per your request.

900
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,640
你并不需要枪
You won't be needing that.

901
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,290
如果他们发现你有枪情况会更糟
It will be worse if they find it on you.

902
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:29,220
其他的都准备就绪了吗?
Everything else ready?

903
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,580
是的 都是按照您的吩咐办的
Yes, everything you requested.

904
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,500
我准备好了
I'm ready.

905
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,970
你觉着他这衬衫怎么样?
What do you think of his shirt?

906
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:42,110
我可不想死的时候穿着这件衬衫
I wouldn't be caught dead in it.

907
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,640
但是对他来说挺完美的
But for him it's perfect.

908
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,660
站到这边
Stand over here.

909
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,120
表情自然点儿
Now look like a free man.

910
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,870
这些柏林青年领袖们本周末在亚历山大广场组织了
These Berlin youth leaders have organised

911
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:01,360
一场示威游行
a demonstration this week at Alexanderplatz.

912
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:09,280
他是不是跟你说我记住了名单的所有内容?
Did he tell you that I memorized the whole list?

913
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,280
是的
Yes.

914
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:16,080
我知道对于某些人来说 我并不是那么重要
I realize I may not be as valuable to some people and

915
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,070
甚至有些人想要杀死我 但是...
Some people may even want me dead but...

916
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,440
我能有什么选择?
What choice do I have?

917
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,660
你死了对我一点好处也没有
You are no good to me dead.

918
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,500
而我从未失手过
And I've never lost a package.

919
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:33,740
我知道
I know.

920
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:43,270
这是他的家人
It's his family.

921
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,910
这事不在我的计划之中
This was not part of the plan.

922
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,720
我的计划里有
Part of mine.

923
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,070
拜托了
Please.

924
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,020
我负责带走他的妻女
I will take the wife and the kid.

925
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,590
你只需要保护好小望远镜
You will just have to deal with Spyglass.

926
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,620
我不知道护照够不够用
I don't know if I have enough passports.

927
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,750
珀西瓦尔
Percival.

928
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,780
你的王牌特工
Your golden boy..

929
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,500
我爱你
I love you.

930
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,560
我们必须出发了
We have to go.

931
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:45,500
西德见 祝你好运
See you in the west. Good luck.

932
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:01,750
我们要自由选举
We want free elections

933
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,540
事先计划里并没有这部分
This was never part of the plan.

934
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,550
我的计划里有
It's part of mine..

935
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:39,140
别起来
Stay low.

936
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,470
进去
In here.

937
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:54,030
我们得先给你止血 否则不可能越过边境
We need to deal with this now or we will never get to cross.

938
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:01,000
我不想死  你不会死的
I don't want to die. You are not going to die.

939
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,950
呆在这
Stay here.

940
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,810
妈的
Fuck!

941
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,090
两个 还有两个
Two more. Just two more.

942
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,740
走
Go!

943
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,180
你需要止血
You need to stop that bleeding...

944
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,390
去找找任何有帮助的东西
Search for anything...

945
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:12,520
酒 碎布
alcohol, rags.

946
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,870
还敢叫我婊子吗?
Am I a bitch now?

947
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,190
上车
Get in!

948
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,810
上车
Get in!

949
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,270
你得好好练练德语
You need to work on your German.

950
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:00,680
讲的太烂了
It's horrible.

951
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:04,550
我操
Fucking hell.

952
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:55,330
系上安全带
Fasten your seatbelt.

953
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:46,090
你没事吧?  我没事
Are you allright? Yeah

954
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,040
我们得走了
We have to go...

955
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,140
太冷了  打开车门
It's so cold! Open your door!

956
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:06,770
我的脚 卡住了
My foot... It's stuck!

957
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,160
我动不了了  深呼吸
I can't move. Just breathe.

958
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,940
我的腿
My leg!

959
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,490
你需要休息一会儿吗?  不
You need a break? No!

960
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,660
那么
So...

961
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,760
好吧 我想我知道全过程了
Yes, I think I understand everything.

962
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,370
你制定了计划
You made your plan.

963
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:50,850
但却失败了
You failed to get the...

964
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,470
你没能把这位极度重要的情报人员安全带到西德
high value asset safely across to the west.

965
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,950
你他妈把我派进了一个马蜂窝里
You sent me in to a fucking hornet's nest.

966
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,180
我刚下飞机就被克格勃的人认出来了
I was made by the KGB from the moment my feet touched the ground.

967
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:05,210
他们甚至可能早就知道了我的身份
Maybe even before.

968
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,210
你早就知道了 对吗?
You knew that. Didn't you?

969
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:12,600
你也怀疑珀西瓦尔
You had your doubts about Percival.

970
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:16,430
所以你利用我去试探他
And you used me to shake him down.

971
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,630
洗耳恭听
Ready when you are.

972
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,420
嘿!是我!
It's me, it's me!

973
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:53,630
他死了
He's dead.

974
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:56,260
小望远镜死了
Spyglass is dead.

975
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:00,460
但你还活着
And you're alive.

976
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:05,430
你没听懂我的意思
You aren't listening to me.

977
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,840
他们知道了
They knew..

978
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:13,190
克格勃的人什么都知道了
The KGB knew everything.

979
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,510
我需要离开这里
I need to get across.

980
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,610
扬
Jan.

981
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,610
我本以为英国佬们能搞定这件事 结果搞得一团糟
I expected more out of the Brits, and a wild goatfuck.

982
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:05,660
我知道 抱歉了
I know, we're sorry.

983
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:08,660
不 等等 等一下 你们没在斯塔西安插人吗?
No wait, your lot don't have your own private stasi agent, do you?

984
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,660
可他们没一个有过目不忘的能力
Not one with a photographic memory.

985
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:21,150
我们得注意布劳顿
We need to get with Broughton.

986
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,210
了解那个计划的所有情况
Get on the same page.

987
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,550
我们需要那份名单
We need that list.

988
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,820
现在就要
Now more than ever.

989
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,470
布劳顿
Broughton.

990
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:30,650
她成功逃了出来
She made it out.

991
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:33,720
真的吗?
Really?

992
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,220
你知道吗
You know...

993
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,310
大卫 一个意大利美女曾经对我说过 大卫
Beautiful Italian girl once said to me, David...

994
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:43,000
你永远不能改变已经发生过的事情
You can't unfuck what's been fucked.

995
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:48,520
女人办事总拖后腿 对吧
Women are always getting in way of progress, aren't they?

996
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:54,990
今晚发生了一件所有德国人都不会相信的事
What no one in Germany believed possible has happened tonight...

997
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:57,640
柏林墙倒了 真的倒了
The wall is coming down, the wall is down.

998
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,400
从1961年起那面墙下就伴随着我们的生活
We are in there living with the wall since 1961 and...

999
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,240
所以 我觉得现在是时候推倒它了
I think now it's time to break the wall down, you know.

1000
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,510
当那面墙粉碎时
The wall is crumbling.

1001
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:13,410
这些年轻人都出生于柏林墙建成之后 他们用锤子敲猛力敲击墙面
The sledgehammers in the hands of men not born when it went up tear into it.

1002
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:16,680
墙后的东德士兵还试图阻止
Behind it, the East German soldiers tried to stop...

1003
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,930
高压水枪都出动了 西柏林人表现地很是坚决
water cannons were brought out, but the west Berliners were determined.

1004
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:23,430
一个西柏林人喷洒香槟以示回应
One west Berliner sprayed champaigne back.

1005
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:26,480
我很负责的告诉你 如果是我跟踪你
If I was to follow you, I mean, properly,

1006
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,820
你永远都发现不了
You would never fucking know.

1007
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:34,110
柏林人等了28年就为这一天
It is the moment Berliners have waited 28 years for.

1008
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:36,230
甚至东德人都显得很兴奋
Even the East Germans seem exhilarated.

1009
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:40,170
柏林墙的建立导致了千百人的死亡
A symbolic breach in the structure that cost hundreds of lives...

1010
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:44,700
使得亲朋爱侣分离数十年 柏林墙的倒下极具历史意义
and separated friends, families and lovers for decades.

1011
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:50,060
小望远镜死后 我在他的大衣口袋中找到了一个法国特高频发信装置
Found a French UHF device in my coat after Spyglass died.

1012
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:53,200
现在我觉得这窃听器是珀西瓦尔放在我外套内的
I now believe it was Percival who planted it.

1013
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,120
而且要让它看起来像拉萨尔做的
Made it look like Lasalle.

1014
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:20,300
你为什么在这
Why are you here?

1015
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,060
你得离开柏林
You need to leave Berlin.

1016
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:28,160
没有了你的消息 我很担心
When I didn't here from you, I got worried.

1017
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,050
别这么幼稚
How naive can you be?

1018
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,270
我们选择了这种生活 德尔菲娜
We chose this life, Delphine.

1019
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,370
这种生活只会有一种结局
This only ends one way.

1020
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:39,600
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1021
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:45,410
我们都进了他的圈套了
He set us both up.

1022
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,900
在你能走的时候赶紧走
You have to leave while you can.

1023
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,310
别低估我 珀西瓦尔
Don't underestimate me, Percival.

1024
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:18,640
哦 拉萨尔 你要仔细听我说
Oh. Lasalle, listen to me very carefully!

1025
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,040
你根本不知道你在跟谁打交道
You have no idea who you are dealing with...

1026
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,930
你给我下套
You set me up.

1027
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:24,600
得了吧 这游戏就是这么玩的
Come on now, this is the game.

1028
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,530
我知道你的秘密 大卫
I know your secrets, David.

1029
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:30,050
而且这个游戏我玩的 比你想象的要好
And I can play this game better than you think.

1030
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,450
珀西瓦尔试图陷害我
Percival is trying to set me up.

1031
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,100
你惊讶吗
Are you surprised?

1032
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,550
并不
Not really.

1033
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,920
特工之间的合作不过是虚与委蛇
These relationships aren't real.

1034
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,380
只是为完成任务的手段罢了
They are just a means to an end.

1035
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:36,930
当你讲真话时 你看起来不一样了
When you tell the truth, you look different.

1036
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:38,670
你的眼神变了
Your eyes change.

1037
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:41,140
谢谢你提醒我
Thanks for the warning.

1038
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:47,130
什么意思?  我的意思是我不会再犯这样的错了
What do you mean? I mean I better not do it again.

1039
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,570
为什么?
Why?

1040
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:51,890
因为将来有一天 我可能会为之丧命
Because it's going to get me killed one day.

1041
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,640
我有些事情需要告诉你
There's something that I need to tell you.

1042
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:08,590
一定和你的朋友珀西瓦尔有关吧
It has to do with your friend Percival.

1043
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:10,200
他...
He...

1044
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,410
对不起 亲爱的
Sorry darling!

1045
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,260
这就是游戏规则
This is the game.

1046
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:43,220
我去
Fuck!

1047
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,220
今晚的街道上庆典将会继续
The celebrations continue in the streets tonight...

1048
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:50,320
从第一波东德人穿过柏林墙开始
from the moment of first wave of East Germans crossing through Berlin

1049
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,370
数千人喝着香槟 一起狂欢
They have been showered with champagne and cheered by a crowd of thousands.

1050
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:58,290
很明显 这将会是东德最激动人心的日子之一
It is clear. This will be one of Berlin's most dramatic days.

1051
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:01,180
当西柏林人从边境涌入时 东柏林人显得十分热情
East Berliners are overcome as they cross the border..

1052
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,340
这条边境整整封闭了28年
That has been closed to them for 28 years.

1053
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:08,830
西柏林人凿穿了那面荼毒了他们城市的墙 然后推倒了它
West Berliners are chipping through wall that scar their city and scaling it.

1054
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:26,540
警察再也不会来干涉他们了
There is no more interfarence from the police.

1055
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:29,240
东西柏林人和平地团结在了一起
Unified Berliners laced up with the peace

1056
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:33,340
数千名示威名着魔似的呼喊着“再无柏林墙”
Thousands of the mutinees, enchanting it, "Down with the wall."

1057
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:58,350
所以现在只有一个问题
So only one question after you ask...

1058
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,560
这次事件中 到底谁才是真正的胜利者
Who won?

1059
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,910
这所谓的游戏到底是什么
And what was the fucking game anyway?

1060
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,190
我曾以为这面墙永远不会倒呢
I was thinking the wall will never fall...

1061
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:14,260
德国的和平变革
Germany's peaceful revolution..

1062
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:30,250
要想赢的话
To win...

1063
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:33,590
首先你必须明确你的立场
First you have to know which side you are on..

1064
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:41,790
在我们的工作中
In our line of work...

1065
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:44,300
有许多阴暗面
That's right up there with black holes.

1066
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:46,990
追随你选择的道路一直到底
All to be or not to be.

1067
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,010
你以为你在为正义而战 忽然有一天你清醒了
You fight the good fight and then one day you wake up..

1068
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:54,810
你会意识到自己是撒旦的使者 不过在传播毁灭而已
And you realize that all you were was satan's little helper.

1069
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,900
真是讽刺啊
Ironic.

1070
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:20,170
新闻告诉公众 不会再有秘密了
The news will them there will be no more secrets.

1071
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:24,510
但你和我都知道这不是真的
But you and I, we both know that's not true.

1072
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:28,880
这个世界永远存在着秘密
The world is run on secrets.

1073
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:37,610
拥有这份名单的人将拥有权利
Whoever has that list has power...

1074
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:40,810
没有它 你不过就是另一个目标罢了
And without it, you're just another fucking target..

1075
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:50,810
所以经历了这一切之后我又学到了什么吗
So what have I learned after all this time?

1076
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:53,940
那所有的无眠之夜
After all those sleepless nights.

1077
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:56,990
那些对朋友 对爱侣 甚至对自己的欺骗
Lying to friends, lovers, myself.

1078
01:35:56,990 --> 01:36:00,310
在这个扭曲的城镇玩这些扭曲的游戏
Playing this crooked game in this crooked town..

1079
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:03,580
充满了恶意中伤和狡诈的谎言
Filled with backstabbers and full fledged lies.

1080
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:07,930
我要告诉你 我在这所明白的 唯一一件事
I'll tell you what I've learned, one thing and one thing only.

1081
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:12,120
我热爱着柏林
I fucking love Berlin!

1082
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:38,470
你不必杀了她的
You didn't have to kill her.

1083
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,020
在你做过那些事之后
You suddenly decided to develop a conscience

1084
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:44,400
你怎么突然良心发现了
after all you've done.

1085
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,930
希望你注意到 每一个跟你接触的人
Hope you noticed how everyone you get close to..

1086
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,950
都以死亡收场...
Ends up fucking dead...

1087
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:52,180
你把计划的细节透露给布雷莫维奇
You gave Bremovych the details of the plan.

1088
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:55,610
你想借克格勃的手来干掉我
You wanted the KGB to take me out.

1089
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:59,990
是啊  你太害怕了 不敢自己动手了
Yeah. You're too fucking scared to do it yourself.

1090
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:06,080
如果这帮克格勃的废物把你搞定了
If those KGB pricks done their part.

1091
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:09,270
那我现在就能受到女王的接见了
I'd be on my way to handjob with the queen by now.

1092
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:12,040
我已经读过那份名单
I have read that list.

1093
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,100
洛林
Lorraine.

1094
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:22,660
原来你是这么淘气的女孩
Turns out you've been a very naughty girl.

1095
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,920
小望远镜对我们来说是个累赘
Spyglass was a liability to us all.

1096
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,220
我不能冒险让他留在你身边
I could not risk leaving him with you.

1097
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,940
名单在哪 大卫
Where is the list, David?

1098
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:33,070
不在我手上
I don't have it.

1099
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:36,680
它正在前往军情六处的路上
It's enroute to MI6, where it belongs!

1100
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,420
到现在你还打算撒谎吗
Are you going to lie to the very end?

1101
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:03,970
真相与谎言
Truth and lies...

1102
01:38:04,690 --> 01:38:06,720
我们这样的人总是很难看出两者的区别
People like us don't know the difference.

1103
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,150
不 我们知道它们的区别 大卫
No, we know the difference, David.

1104
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:11,970
我们只是选择去无视它
We choose to ignore it.

1105
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,800
不是吗 萨切尔同志
Isn't that right comrade Satchel?

1106
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,530
原来你准备这么干
So that's how you make it work?

1107
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:22,600
欺骗欺人者 其乐无穷
It's a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.

1108
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,700
干的漂亮
Well played.

1109
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,030
你杀了大卫·珀西瓦尔
You killed David Percival.

1110
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:47,670
詹姆斯·加斯科涅和大卫·珀西瓦尔
All the paperwork are in order

1111
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:51,020
尸体和文件手续都准备好了
for the bodies of James Gascoigne and David Percival.

1112
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:57,800
你杀了柏林情报站的负责人  一名宣誓效忠女皇陛下的特工
You killed our head of station, an officer of the crown.

1113
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,320
你最好有确凿的证据和充足的理由
You better have hard proof and a damn good explanation.

1114
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,950
你有什么资格来审判我?  我是你的上级
Who are you to judge my actions? I'm your superior.

1115
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,670
我的上级
My superior..

1116
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:17,610
这次任务和阻止冷战没有任何关系
This was never about stopping the war.

1117
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:20,790
而是为了保住你的位置
...was about saving your ass.

1118
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:24,000
我们在冷战中犯下的罪行 要是暴露出去
You couldn't bear the embarrassment

1119
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,470
会让你十分难堪
of the sins that we committed in the Cold War.

1120
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:30,590
我是多么愚蠢啊 竟然愿意为之卖命
And I was stupid enough to give my life for it.

1121
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:31,950
好吧
Yes, well...

1122
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,730
这就是你的工作 不是吗
That's your job, isn't it?

1123
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:36,200
我完成了我的工作
I did my job.

1124
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:42,950
虽然你在我的背后捅刀子 而且能力极其低下
Despite your backstabbers and your incompetence..

1125
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:46,390
我完成了你搞不定的任务
I succeeded where you failed.

1126
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:50,760
我把内部的叛徒 萨切尔 揪了出来
I uncovered your traitor Satchel.

1127
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:54,010
给了唯一配得上他的结局
Brought him the only justice he deserved.

1128
01:39:57,170 --> 01:39:59,120
死亡
A bullet!

1129
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:04,810
就在小望远镜被杀前一天珀西瓦尔见了布雷莫维奇
Percival meeting with Bremovych. The day before Spyglass was killed.

1130
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,630
或许我们可以做一些准备
Maybe we can make some sort of arrangement

1131
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:12,120
你要知道我是这里唯一一个能帮你拿到那份名单的人
..you've gotta know I am the only man in this town that can help you get that list.

1132
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,590
我记住你了
Very impressive.

1133
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:17,700
奉献 忠诚这些品质现如今都难能可贵
Dedication... loyality are rare thing these days.

1134
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:21,610
欺骗欺骗者 其乐无穷
It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.

1135
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,990
成交吗
We have an deal?

1136
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:31,480
那这位英国小姐怎么想的呢?
What about the British?

1137
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,710
你信任格雷吗?   并不
Do you trust Gray? No.

1138
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:35,750
那C呢?
What about C.?

1139
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:37,820
C是个自大的哈巴狗
C is a arrogant lab dog

1140
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,970
珀西瓦尔就是萨切尔
Percival was Satchel.

1141
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,850
那名单在哪?
Where is the list?

1142
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,710
名单在哪? 洛林
Where is the list, Lorraine?

1143
01:40:58,410 --> 01:41:00,410
我不知道
I don't know.

1144
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,280
扯淡
Oh, bollocks.

1145
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,290
首相最近可不会好过了
The Prime Minister's gonna have a difficult time with this.

1146
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,280
我们决定隐瞒这个任务 布劳顿
We are choosing to burry this one, Broughton.

1147
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,980
你的任务从未发生
Your mission never took place.

1148
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,270
这段对话
This conversation...

1149
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,080
也从未发生
It never happened.

1150
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:29,540
我打算让你休假一段时间 立即生效
I am putting you on leave effective immidiately.

1151
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:33,500
你会开始一段新生活 好好休息
You will start the next decade.. Well rested.

1152
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:36,510

C...
C..

1153
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:40,640
我该穿什么
What should I wear?

1154
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:48,670
去和女王喝茶?
For my tea with the Queen?

1155
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:03,160
你真的认为我会把名单给你?
Did you really think I was going to give you that list?

1156
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:08,450
在你死前 我想让你那迟钝的脑袋明白
Before you die, I want to get this through your thick primitive skull.

1157
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,930
我从未为你工作
I've never worked for you.

1158
01:46:12,930 --> 01:46:15,770
你却一直在为我卖命
You worked for me.

1159
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,070
我给你的每一个假情报
Every false intel I gave you...

1160
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:26,510
都在铁幕上撕开一道裂缝
A rip in the iron curtain.

1161
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:32,710
你给我的每一个情报都化作我枪膛里的一颗子弹
Every piece of intel you gave me a bullet in my fucking gun.

1162
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:35,300
我想好好过日子
I want my life back.

1163
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,320
一路顺风
Safe travels.

1164
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:54,280
航班预计在11小时37分钟之后抵达兰利市
Estimated flight time to Langley, 11 hours and 37 minutes

1165
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:56,470
准备起飞
Clear to takeoff.

1166
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,380
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

1167
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:01,160
听起来不错
That sounds good.

1168
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,290
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

1169
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:12,820
你当时骂我浑蛋?
Cocksucker?

1170
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:15,090
真的吗?
Really?

1171
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:20,180
很不错 我们俩演的还挺像的
I'm glad it was convincing.
