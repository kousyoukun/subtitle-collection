00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:15,680


2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:26,680

斯塔西：东德秘密情报机构

5
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,560
东德和西德
East and West..

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,010
并非因为彼此有武装而互相猜疑
Do not mistrust each other because we are armed..

7
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,210
恰恰是因为我们互相猜疑
We are armed...

8
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,240
我们才不得不武装起来
because we mistrust each other.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,290
戈尔巴乔夫先生
Mr Gorbachev,

10
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,400
拆掉这堵墙
Tear down this wall.

00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,490
28年后 1989年11月
In November 1989, after 28 years,

12
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,050
柏林墙被推倒 冷战结束
The Berlin Wall came down and the cold war ended.

13
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,460
我们要讲的不是这个柏林墙的故事
This is not that story.

14
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,180
柏林 1989年11月

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,360
该死的詹姆斯・加斯科涅
James fuckin' Gascoigne...

17
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,730
你是怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

18
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,770
你他妈还以为自己间谍当的挺好的吧
Maybe you're not as good at this spy shit as you think.

19
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,260
是萨丘对吗?
It was Satchel, wasn't it?

20
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,450
萨丘出卖了我
Satchel gave me up.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,600
我一直认为应该由最好的特工解决我
I always thought if I got tackled by the best,

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,520
但是巴赫金 你不是最好的
But you're not the best, are you Bakhtin?

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
你就是个克格勃的混蛋
You're the biggest fucking cunt in the KGB.

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,070
尽管骂吧 吉米
Sticks and stones, Jimmy.

25
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,540
10天后 伦敦

C长官在哪?

28
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,460
考虑到最近的发生的事 这次审讯他是不会露面的
Given the scale of recent world events he will not be joining us.

29
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,990
是啊 当然了
Yes of course.

38
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,460
洛林 这次主要汇报人是你
Lorraine, you're the subject of this debriefing.

39
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,730
但你不是管事的 我明白
- Not it's controller. - I understand.

40
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,600
我当时在柏林

00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,760
我在此全权代表中情局

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,170
本来为了让你好受一点

43
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,880
我可以和他们一起躲到玻璃后面
I could stand behind the mirror with everybody else.

44
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,000
不巧那边挤了点
But it's a little crowded there.

45
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,740
婊子养的
Cock sucker..

46
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,680
你说什么?
What did you say?

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,520
没说什么
I didn't say anything.

48
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
洛林 你刚说什么了?
I'm sorry, did you say something, Lorraine?

49
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,530
你听见我说什么了? 我知道你说了
- Did your hear me say something? - I thought you said something.

50
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,150
她说什么了?
What did she say?

51
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,350
啊?
What?

52
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,820
额..
Now...

53
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,460
你可以把录像带倒回去听听啊
Do you want to play the tape back?

54
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,060
好吧
Well then.

55
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,570
我们可以开始了吗
Shall we begin?

56
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,000
柏林那边
Berlin.

57
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,040
到底发生了什么事?
What happened?

58
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
是啊
And...

59
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,750
柏林
Hm, Berlin...

60
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,750
妈的
Fuck..

61
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,140
最开始
THE BEGINNING

62
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,220
你好 洛林
Ah, Lorraine,

63
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,950
抱歉这么着急把你叫来
Sorry to bring you in a such short notice.

64
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,590
你认识C长官吧?
You know C.

65
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,540
认识 我们刚刚看了你的档案
- Yes - We were just going over your file.

66
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,650
知道你俄语很棒

擅长近身肉搏战

70
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,800
你所掌握的技能真是让人印象深刻啊
It is an impressive set of skills.

71
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,900
跟我一样 很了解苏联人
Knowing the Reds as I do,

72
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,870
想完成任务她得使出浑身解数了
she'll need to use every damn one of them.

73
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,300
那我就直接切入主题了
I will get straight to the point

74
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,020
你对詹姆斯.加斯科涅了解多少?
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

75
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,520
知道一点
Enough to say hello.

76
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,620
我们85年在伊斯坦布尔一起工作过
We worked together in Istanbul in 85.

77
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,350
他死了
He is dead.

78
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,300
他昨晚在柏林执行任务时被杀害
Gascoigne was killed last night on a mission in Berlin.

79
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,330
今天早上西德警察把他的尸体从河里打捞出来
West German police fished his body out of the street this morning.

80
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,230
并且从他身体里取出一枚7.62毫米的托卡列夫手枪子弹
And the coronary extracted a 7.62 mm Tokarev round...

81
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,570
刺穿头骨
From the base of the skull.

82
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,110
苏联人干的
Soviets..

83
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,930
昨天加斯科涅会见了一位斯塔西的军官
Yesterday.. Gascoigne met with a Stasi officer,

84
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,020
代号"小望远镜"
code named Spyglass.

85
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,520
我们承诺给小望远镜提供豁免权 以此来交换一个缩微胶卷中的文件
We promised Spyglass immunity in exchange for a document on microfilm..

86
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,140
我们称它为“名单”
Codenamed "The list".

87
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,170
这份名单藏在一个瑞士手表里
Hidden in a Swiss watch.

88
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,450
名单上有所有秘密活跃的官员名字
The list contains every active clandestine officer.

89
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,150
和所有见不得人的交易
All the shady deals..

90
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,200
信息量极大
It's an atomic bomb of information

91
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,120
足以让冷战再延续四十年
that could extend the cold war for another forty years,

92
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,640
我们认为现在名单在杀害加斯科涅的那个杀手手里
And we believe that the man that killed Gascoigne, now has it.

93
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,160
我们的消息来源指向尤里・巴赫金
Our sources point to Yuri Bakhtin,

94
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,980
此人是克格勃机构的头牌杀手 手上有几十条人命
KGB hatchet man with more than a dozen confirmed kills.

95
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,620
所以你要派我去莫斯科?
So, you want me in Moscow?

96
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,600
不
No.

97
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,530
巴赫金并没上飞机
Bakhtin never got on the flight.

98
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,980
所以他和那个名单都还在柏林
So he's still in Berlin along with the list.

99
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,060
所有人都在找他 美国佬和法国方面
Everyone is hunting for it, the Yankees, the Frogs.

100
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,910
苏联方面 当然还有我们的人 珀西瓦尔
- Soviets, and Cruzes.. - And our man, Percival

101
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,030
- 珀西瓦尔是谁? - 大卫・珀西瓦尔
- Who is Percival? - David Percival.

102
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,430
他是我们在柏林的一号特工
He is our number one in Berlin.

103
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,490
也是你的联络人
He is your point of contact.

104
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,410
营业中
The shop is open!

105
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,580
钱好 但是情报更好
Money is good, information is better.

106
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,930
你给我带了什么情报?
And you? What do you have for me?

107
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,850
这可是上好的香水
Straight from the teat of the Virgin Mary.

108
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,080
东柏林
EAST BERLIN

109
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,620
搞到这东西不容易
Jordache wasn't easy.

110
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,190
这是我给我妻子准备的生日礼物
It's for my wife's birthday.

111
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,870
很好 现在告诉我名单在哪里
That's very nice, now where is that fucking list?

112
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,440
我昨晚把胶片给加斯科涅了
I gave the microfilm to Gascoigne last night.

113
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,910
他并没有出现
James didn't show up.

114
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,510
我已经做了我该做的 把名单给他了
I did my part I gave him the list.

115
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,480
你必须把我和我家人送走 我们在这里不安全
You have to get me and my family across this. Not safe for us anymore here.

116
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,830
俄国人盯上我了
The Russian's are onto me.

117
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,940
没有名单 免谈
No list, no deal.

118
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,210
我可是豁出去了啊 没有名单 免谈
- I risked everything. - No list, no deal..

119
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,580
听着小望远镜 没拿到名单
You listen to me Spyglass without that list...

120
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,160
我完全可以把你拉出去一枪毙了你
Why shouldn't I take you outside and shoot you in the fucking head?

121
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,150
你敢杀一名斯塔西官员?
You are going to kill a stasi officer?

122
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,930
对于你这种要投奔西德的 是的
One that's about to defect to the west, yeah.

123
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,900
没有大使馆照顾
Without an embassy to look after him

124
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,350
珀西瓦尔 什么都要靠自己 和当地人差不多了
Percival has gone somewhat native.

125
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,100
狂傲不逊
And fucking feral,

126
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,060
柏林局势混乱
Berlin is the Wild West.

127
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,700
要是那该死的墙倒塌 我们可不想被埋在下面
If that bloody wall comes crashing down we don't want to be under it.

128
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,290
要是苏联方面得到名单 我们都要被盯上了
If the Russians get that list, we're all bugged.

129
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,000
这就被动了
Side ways.

130
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,940
你的新身份是伊丽莎白・劳埃德
You are Elisabeth Loyd.

131
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,330
一位毕业于剑桥的律师 受詹姆斯.加斯科涅家人所托
A Cambridge- educated lawyer, sent by James Gascoinge's family

to retrieve the body and the effects of their recently deceased son.

133
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,690
你的任务就是找到珀西瓦尔
Your mission is to connect with Percival

134
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,070
不惜一切代价拿回名单
and do whatever it takes to get that list home.

135
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,500
记住 洛林
And remember Lorraine...

136
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,160
这是敏感时期
This is highly sensitive..

137
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,880
不要相信任何人
Trust no one.

138
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,750
跟我走 快
Follow me! Come, come, come.

139
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,250
这边 快点

190
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,300
我问他在那里如何生存
I asked him what the deal was and he said...

191
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,860
他说尽量融入当地人的生活
Is to blend in.

192

让自己看起来像当地人一样

194
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,360
我当时正沿着门口跑
I was running by gate by the way. I mean, how the fuck,

195
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,220
那些犹太人怎么会认为你会帮我找回名单?
does the Jews think that you're gonna be able to help me find that list?

196
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,290
只要你去认领加斯科涅的尸体
As soon as you pick up Gascoingne's body,

197
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,410
他们就会注销你的护照 明天用第一班飞机把你遣送出境
They will null and void your visa and you'll be on the first flight back home.

198
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,660

我办公室就在那边

我不是来这儿搜集明信片的
I'm not here to collect postcards, Percival.

201
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,150
我的酒店就转角处 在那下车
Just drop me at my hotel, it's around the corner.

202
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,620
你不是说你之前没来过柏林吗?
I thought you said you had never been to Berlin before.

203
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,280
难道我不会看地图吗?
I can read a fucking map!

204
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,600
一分钟就看懂地图了
That will just take a minute.

205

219
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,790
这是什么?
What have we here?

220
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,090
来啊 来跳舞
Come on, dance for me.

221
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,560
音乐响起了
The music is on, no?

222
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,080
给他来点掌声
Give him a round of applause.

223

昨晚有个家伙在这里

224
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,860

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,490
他没露过面 布雷莫维奇同志
He never showed up, Comrade Bremovych.

229
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,700
资本主义的败类 他会卖掉名单的
Capitalist bastard, he's gonna sell the list.

认识吗?
Do you know him?

235
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,200
今晚的柏林高度警戒
Tensions are high in East Berlin tonight,

236
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,020
因为公民抗议行为势头不减
as civil disobedience continues to build momentum.

237
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,210
警方用催泪瓦斯和水枪镇压示威人群
These berlin youth leaders shout out their protest..

238
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,410
这些柏林青年仍然大声表达自己的抗议
Through tear gas and water cannons

239
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,940
并有多起报道说警察
and there are numerous reports of police

240
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,410
用警棍殴打和平示威者

尸体是通过身体组织鉴定的
The body was identified by a tissue.

243
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,120
我相信
Yes. I believe so.

244
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,980
这不是一个问题
This was not a question.

245
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,810
这是个声明
It was a statement.

246
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,180
他是你同事?
He was your colleague?

247
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,820
不在同一部门
Different department.

248
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,660
- 他是哪个部门的 - 不是跟我一个部门的
- Which department? - A different one.

249
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,430
你有转移尸体的授权书吗?
Do you have the transfer papers?

250
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,070
你们知道那些电影吗 画面渐渐慢下来
Do you know those movies where the picture just starts to slow down...

251
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,630

252
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,650
然后燃烧
Then get fire...

253
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,120
哇
Wow...

254
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,800
柏林的日子就像那种电影一样
That's Berlin.

255
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,220
护照号码是错的
The passport number is incorrect.

256
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,210
如果不提供准确信息的话我是不会让你带走尸体的
I will not release this body without the right information.

257
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,880
这个错误没什么大不了的
It's a simple mistake.

258
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,280
罗伊德女士 在德国 我们从不会犯这种低级的错误
Miss Loyd, in Germany we don't make simple mistakes.

259
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,000
我实话实说 你让我吃了一惊
I am not gonna lie. I'm impressed.

260
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,880
敢跑到我这来 胆子得够大
You have got some balls breaking in here!

261
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,610

You should see my balls then you will be really impressed.

262
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,420
我记住你这句话了
I will take your word for it.

263
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,470
我知道你找到了留在德国的办法
I see you've found a way to stay,

264
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,880
你把16天的签证时长改成了76天
You are at 16 when you feel it's 76.

265
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,190
没错
That's right.

266
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,520
我哪儿也不去
I am not going anywhere.

267
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,010
我至少在这呆一周
I'm here for at least another week.

268
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,980
我他妈的太幸运了
Lucky fucking me.

269
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,810
他们现在是不会交出尸体的 除非他们解开谜团 找到真相
They won't release his body now, till they investigated that right through a nightmare.

270
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,840
你到底怎么进来的?
How the fuck did you get in here?

271
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,550
我呆在柏林很久了 我应该认识几乎所有还不错的宾馆
You know, I've been in Berlin a long time, and I think I know every doormen..

272
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,070
的看门人
Of every decent shithouse

273
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,430
还有柏林墙两边还算不错的妓院
borderlined decent brothels on both sides of the wall.

274
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,040
那你肯定认识小望远镜
Well then you must know Spyglass.

275
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,970
我从来没见过他
Never met the fella.

276
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,440
他是詹姆斯的人
He was James'

277
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,650
从机场就一直跟着我的那个女人 你了解她的情况吗?
What do you know about this woman who's been following me since Templehof?

278
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,340
我不得不说 你真的太有魅力
I'd say that you're an attractive woman...

279
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,060
然后你得自己想想为什么了
and you should do the math.

280
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,540
你知道的如果是我跟踪你 我说认真的
You know, if I was to follow you, I mean, properly

281
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,070
你永远不会发现
you'd never fuckin know.

282
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,140
跟踪是有技巧的
There's a knack to it, isn't there?

283
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,420
就像走钢丝 吹风笛一样
It's like walking a tightrope or playing the bagpipes.

284
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,840
你可能很快就轻车熟路 也可能一辈子都学不会
You can either do it, or you can't.

285
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,090
随便你
Knock yourself out.

286
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,550
我想买块表
I'd like to purchase a watch.

287
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,790
我需要获取东德情报网的权限
I need access to a network in East Berlin.

288
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,320
明天关门之前再来
Come back tomorrow before closing.

289
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,520
尽管共产党官员尽力维持秩序
East Berlin.. Is on a short fuse again tonight,

290
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,710
但今晚东德再一次举行游行示威
as communist party officials struggled to maintain order.

291
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,870
你了解詹姆斯多少?
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

292
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,350
他死了
He is dead.

293
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,910
验尸官在头盖骨底部
The coronary extracted a 7.62mm Tokarev

294
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,350
取出7.62毫米托卡列夫手枪子弹
around in the base of his skull.

295
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,730
苏联人干的
Soviets

296
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,400
我们知道萨丘是谁
We know who Satchel is.

297
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,890
我们必须离开
We need to run.

298
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,250
你想在加斯科涅的公寓里找到名单吗?
You expected to find the list in Gascoigne's apartment?

299
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,800
你没有意识到你已经太迟了吗?
You realized you were late to the party?

300
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,000
珀西瓦尔还有那些俄罗斯人肯定已经抢先搜查过了
Percival, the Russians, everybody must have already ransacked the place.

301
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,770
是的
Yes.

302
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,710
我们的问题不只是那份名单
But the list wasn't our only problem.

303
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,600
我去柏林之前 你还告诉过我一件事
Before I left, you told me one last thing.

304
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:05,200
这就是我为什么我不希望中情局的人在场
This is exactly why I didn't want the CIA present.

305
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,630
小望远镜透露 这份名单
Spyglass revealed that this list..

306
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,380
会使一个代号为萨丘的双重间谍暴露身份
Would expose a double agent by the name of Satchel.

307
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,790
无论是死是活 我要见到萨丘
I want Satchel, dead or alive.

308
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,060
这个叛徒多年来都是我们的眼中钉
This traitor's been a thorn in our side for years.

309
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,580
他败坏了我们的名声
He is a black eye to the Crown.

310
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,250
这也是军情六处有史以来最大的一起情报泄露案件
And the single biggest intelligence leak in MI6 history.

311
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,150
你必须得找到这个叫萨丘的混蛋
You expose this bastard Satchel.

312
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,810
要不然我们就判决你犯下叛国罪 执行绞刑
We'll hang you for treason.

313
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,190
然后你就可能发现自己坐在白金汉宫喝茶
You might find yourself taking tea in Buckingham Palace.

314
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,240
所以
So no.

315
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,880
我并不只是在加斯科涅的公寓里找那份名单
I wasn't just looking for the list in Gascoigne's apartment.

316
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,410
前进 把她抓回来
Go ahead, bring her back.

317
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,110
小心点
Take action.!

318
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,540
我和珀西瓦尔对合作的定义明显不一样
Percival and I seem to have a different definition for collaboration.

319
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,900
- 在第三层 - 快上楼
- In the third floor. - Quickly the stairs!

320
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,840
这是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

321
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,550
只有他知道我去了加斯科涅的公寓
He was the only one who knew I was going to Gascoigne's apartment.

322
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,420
如果我发现他报警了
If I knew he was going to call the police,

323
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,400
我会换身装束
I would have worn a different outfit.

324
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,300
换身装束..
Different outfit...

325
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,840
快点 我看到了
Quick. I saw something.

326
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,410
喂!站住!
Hey! halt!

327
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,220
街上出现了越来越多追求改变的呼声
With repeated calls for change on the streets

328
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,740
这使示威者更加有信心
and the protestors going ever more confident..

329
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,260
留给东德政府的时间已经不多了
Time is running out for the east German governtment.

330
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,780
人们普遍认为 由共产党执政的局面
Popular opinion has it that the Communist.

331
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,730
不会持续太久
Claim to leadership can't be upheld much longer.

332
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,360
如果还没有改变
And if rapid change is not forthcoming..

333
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,560
那么今天相对平静的抗议
Today's relatively calm protest..

334
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,670
就会是暴风雨前的宁静
Could be seen as the calm before the storm.

335
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,010
人们要求的不仅是换一个新的领导人
It's not just new faces that recalled for..

336
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,550
或许还想彻底拆除柏林墙
But perhaps a complete demolition of the wall.

337
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,470
外套给我吧
Let me take your coat.

338
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,080
别太拘束
Make yourself at home..

339
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,390
我的天
Fucking yeah!

340
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,880
喝杜松子酒吗?
You want a pair of Jeans?

341
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,840
请自便
Help yourself.

342
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,800
你的图书馆里竟然有拉里・弗林特的色情书
Your library includes Larry Flynt.

343
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,580
言论自由的追求者嘛
Champion of free to speech.

344
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,500
你怎么看巴赫金的?
What did you find on Bakhtin?

345
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,770
如果巴赫金想要俄罗斯人拿到那份名单
Look if Bakhtin.. Wanted the Russians to have that list,

346
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,830
那么现在他早就给他们了
he would have given it to them by now.

347
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,690
你只要等他进一步的活动
You just have to wait for him to make his move.

348
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,220
我等不及了
I can't afford to wait.

349
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,850
珀西瓦尔 这是你的地盘
This is your city, Percival.

350
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,540
但是你居然只认识些看门的和些妓女
But you only know doormen and belhoffs.

351
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,620
所以你在加斯科涅的公寓里找到了什么?
So what did you find in Gascoigne's apartment?

352
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,620
一些标记
Some Doich marks.

353
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,470
空白的护照 签证
Empty passports, visas.

354
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,720
还有几年前你们俩的合照
And a picture of two of you.. together a few years back.

355
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,730
我没说过我们是朋友吗?
Did I not mention that we were friends?

356
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,840
- 没有 - 没有?
- No. - No?

357
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,870
我可能忘说了
I must have forgotten.

358
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,610
那就当我现在告诉你了吧
There you go love.

359
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,360
我要去走走
I'm down for a walk.

360
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,150
我们都在那个名单上
Look, we are all exposed by that list.

361
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,380
拯救世界虽然很酷
Saving the world is cool and all that...

362
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,710
但是我的目标是保住自己的性命
but my main objective is staying alive.

363
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,650
我驻扎德国10年了
I have been held up in Berlin stationed for 10 years,

364
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,810
你要知道我是这里唯一一个能帮你拿到那份名单的人
you have got to know I am the only man in this town who can help you get that list.

365
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,430
没错 我看过你的档案
Yes, I've read your file.

366
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,750
我也看了你的档案
I've also read your DOG file.

367
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,710
那我们就别废话了
So let's cut the crap.. shall we?

368
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,650
你整天喝的酩酊大醉 疯疯癫癫 我不知道你真实的一面是什么样子
This whole hungover, sheer play, don't know which way is up act..

369
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,400
但是我不会轻易上当的
I am not buying it.

370
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,590
到现在为止我还是相信你 但是我也可以随时抛弃你
I trust you but far as I can throw you.

371
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,410
欺骗欺人者 其乐无穷
"It's a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver".

372
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,060
你书架上有本尼克洛・马基雅维利的书
Nicola Maquiavelo. It was on your shelf.

373
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,060
- 天哪 我想我爱上你了 - 非常遗憾
- Oh, my God, I think I fucking love you. - That's too bad.

374
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:17,520
如果关于巴赫金的事 珀西瓦尔说的都是真话
If Percival.. Was telling the truth about Bakhtin,

375
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,810
我得查出俄罗斯人知道了什么
I needed to figure out what the Russians knew.

376
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,820
来一杯斯托尼酒 加冰
Stoney on ice.

377
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,340
晚上好 女士
Good evening Miss.

378
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,070
我今晚不说德语
I am not speaking German tonight.

379
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,090
所以那你是英国人
So you're British.

380
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,210
你以为我是瑞典人吗?
Were you hoping I was Swedish?

381
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,450
我记住你了
Very impressive.

382
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,140
这绝不是你唯一的天赋
This can't be your only talent.

383
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,910
天才是会被高估的
Talents can be overrated.

384
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:52,320
但能尽心尽力办事又忠心耿耿的人是越来越少见了
But dedication and loyality is very rare these days.

385
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,040
这里的每个人都在找某样东西
Everyone here searching for something.

386
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,160
你在找什么?
What are you looking for?

387
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
说了这么多
When all said and done..

388
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,370
你还不如说 我们所有人实际上找得都是同一件东西
Wouldn't you say deep down we're all just searching for the same thing..

389
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
我让您一个人呆了会
I leave you alone for only a moment...

390
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,560
您就有仰慕者了?
and already you are attracting admirers.

391
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,740
先生 三个人本来也可以的
Mossier, three is not always a crowd.

392
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,650
但是今晚不行
But tonight it is.

393
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,890
法国小姐 你又来了啊
French women

394
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,080
那这位英国小姐怎么想的呢?
What about the British?

395
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,240
或许我们可以达成一些协议?
Maybe we can make some sort of arrangement?

396
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,210
我们太久没见了
We haven't seen each other in a long time,

397
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,840
所以得好好聊聊
and we really need to catch up.

398
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,290
单独谈谈
Alone.

399
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,400
女士们 柏林是个小地方
Ladies, Berlin is a small place.

400
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,500
我想我们会再见面的
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

401
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,960
抱歉
Sorry.

402
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,480
你看起来需要帮助
You looked like you needed saving.

403
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,310
多谢你的好意 还请问女士你叫?
Well I appreciate the gesture, Miss...?

404
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,580
拉萨尔
Lasalle...

405
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,290
德尔菲娜・拉萨尔
Delphine Lasalle.

406
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,490
很高兴认识你
Pleased to meet you.

407
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,720
所以 德尔菲娜 你是做什么的?
So, what do you do, Delphine?

408
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,340
我是兼职口译者
I am a part- time translator.

409
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,620
但我更想当个诗人
Who really wants to be a poet...

410
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,270
或者是个摇滚巨星
maybe a rock star.

411
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,980
我的朋友在附近有家俱乐部
My friend owns a club nearby.

412
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,060
你想去吗?

414
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,200
我不能
I can't.

415
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,720
好吧 反正我给你个地址
Well, I'll give you the address anyway.

416
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,930
明晚在那不见不散
Come meet me there tomorrow night.

417
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,580
你会来吗?
Will you come?

418
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,210
也许吧
Maybe?

你很执着啊
You are relentless.

420
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,030
是啊
Oui..

421
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,950
大卫・哈塞霍夫在城里
David Hasselhof is in town.

422
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,270
我们很幸运
Lucky us.

423
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,100
柏林真的完了
Berlin is truly doomed..

424
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,470
你的手表准备好了
Your watch is ready.

425
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,140
在桌上的信封里
It's on that counter, in that plain envelop.

426
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,600
我相信你肯定会觉得我的线人非常棒
I think you will find my contact very useful.

427
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,770
你的手表准备好了

428
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,430
在桌上的信封里
It's on that counter. In that plain envelop.

429
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,020
我相信你肯定会觉得我的线人非常棒
I think you will find my contact very useful.

430
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,620
东德人在本周早些时候
East Berliners stormed the West Germany embassies in

431
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,300
闯进捷克斯洛伐克的西德大使馆
Czechoslovakia early at this week...

432
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,080
现在捷克政府下令 在边境站处
As the Czech government has began to waive the refugees

433
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,450
不必问难民太多问题 尽快放行
through checkpoints with few questions.

434
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,440
公众不禁疑惑 东德政府这样还能持续多久
One has to ask how long the East Berlin government can hold on..

435
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,460
巴赫金和名单还没出现在西德
Bakhtin and the list had not yet surfaced in the west.

436
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,230
我要和我的新线人见面谈谈
I needed to meet my new contact.

437
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,940
看看我在东德到底要对付谁
And see what I was up against in the east.

438
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,260
你应该申请访问资格
You should have applied for a visit experiment.

439
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,450
你从事的是什么工作?
What kind of work do you do?

440
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,440
法律事务
Legal affairs..

441
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,710
如果你在六点之前没回来
If you do not return before 6'o clock..

442
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:22,340
你就会被逮捕 清楚了吗?
You will be arrested. Did you understand?

443
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,890
我知道了
I understand.

444
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,990
现在我还是不是很相信你的故事
Right now I'm not feeling very confident of this story of yours.

445
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,510
为什么在东德不用珀西瓦尔的线人
Why not use Percival's connections in the East?

446
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,930
你告诉过我
You told me...

447
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,060
不要相信任何一个人
To trust no one.

448
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,570
你好
Hello.

449
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,240
我不确定 但我想就是她
I'm not sure, but I think it's her.

450
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,330
她现在在去亚历山大广场的路上
She is heading towards Alexanderplatz.

451
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,310
把她抓过来
Bring her to me.

452
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,100
你跟我走
You are coming with me.

453
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,910
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

454
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,450
他就只想谈谈
He just wants to talk.

455
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,330
快点 这边!
Go ahead, on the side!

456
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,070
你迟到了
You are late.

457
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,200
还被人跟踪
And you were followed.

458
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,990
我迟到就是因为我被人跟踪了
I'm late because I was followed.

459
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,510
20分钟之前 我在共和国广场附近 刚甩掉他们
I lost them 20 minutes ago near the Piazza della Republic.

460
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,050
你还真有两下子啊
You're as good as your reputation.

461
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,470
你确定在这见面最好吗?
Are you sure this is the best place to meet?

462
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,040
在敌人的眼皮底子下
Keep your enemies close.

463
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,630
最危险的地方就是最安全的地方
I am a permanent fixture for them now.

464
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,540
钟表匠说 这些天在黑市
The watchmaker says there has been great interest in this list..

465
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,980
有很多人对这份名单感兴趣
...In the black market the last few days.

466
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,260
- 有巴赫金的消息了吗? - 没有
- Any sign of Bakhtin? - No.

467
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,840
这个萨丘让墙两边的人忧心忡忡
This Satchel character, has people worried on both sides of the wall.

468
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,460
没错
Yeah..

469
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,420
你的情报网怎么样?
What kind of network have you assembled?

470
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,640
在墙的这边
There's a lot of dissatisfied youths...

471
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,640
有很多对他们不满意的年轻人
on this side of the wall.

472
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,490
他们就像
They are like uh...

473
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,540
导火索
Tinder books.

474
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,570
只要你找到正确的火花
If you find the right spark...

475
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,810
继续说
keep talking.

476
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,700
我想卖块表
I am interested in selling a watch.

477
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,110
具体说说看
What are you selling?

478
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,790
它非常贵重
It is extremely valuable...

479
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,010
质量很好
Finest quality and...

480
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,170
还装满了秘密
filled with secrets.

481
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:57,160
介意我先检查一下货物么?
Would you mind if I inspect the merchandise?

482
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:01,970
我当然介意
Fuck yes, I mind.

483
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,880
你只要告诉有意愿的买家
Just tell potential buyers...

484
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,730
巴赫金有意出售
Bakhtin is open for business.

485
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:26,310
女士们 柏林是个小地方
Ladies, Berlin is small place.

486
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,680
我想我们会再见面的
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

487
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,150
抱歉
Sorry.

488
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,350
你看起来需要帮助
You looked like you needed saving.

489
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,140
我朋友在附近有家俱乐部
My friend owns a club nereby.

490
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,270
你想来吗?
Wanna come check it out?

491
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,350
我还以为你不会来
I didn't think that you'd show.

492
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,920
斯托尼加冰
Stoney on the rocks.

493
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,440
你记性不错
You pay attention.

494
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,450
我喜欢追求细节
I look for pleasure in the details.

495
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,470
既然我们聊的还不错
Speaking of which...

496
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:28,400
我真想问你个问题
I have been dying to ask you a question..

497
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,100
我们去个安静点的地方
Let's go someplace quite.

498
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:07,980
为什么带着枪 德尔菲娜?
Why the gun, Delphine?

499
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,510
你以为你伪装的很好 但实际上很烂
You're not as well disguised as you may think.

500
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,150
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

501
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,500
你是军情六处的洛林
You are Lorraine Broughton, MI6.

502
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,850
你到这里来就是因为詹姆斯死了
And you are here because of the death of Gascoigne.

503
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,800
关于詹姆斯 你知道些什么事?
What do you know about Gascoigne?

504
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,390
什么也不知道
Nothing.

505
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,000
但是如果有人杀了个盟军的特工
But if someone is killing Allied officers...

506
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,150
我们不都得关注吗?
Shouldn't we all care?

507
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,570
假如人们都愿意
What if it is in that list...?

508
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,090
为了那份名单去厮杀
That's people willing to kill for it.

509
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,840
这是我在法国情报局的第一项任务
It's my first assignment with the French intelligence.

510
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,390
我来这儿只有一年
I've only been here a year.

511
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,960
我害怕了 不行吗?
I'm scared, okay?

512
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,190
当初我接了这项任务是因为觉着很刺激
I got into this because it was exciting,

513
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,500
但是没曾想柏林会变成现在这副模样
But it's never been like this in Berlin.

514
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,440
你应该去当一名诗人的
You should have become a poet.

515
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,320
或去做个摇滚明星
Or a rock star.

516
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,690
所以你和一个法国女特工接上头了
So you made contact with the French operative.

517
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,370
是的
Obviously.

518
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,730
为什么?
Why?

519
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:28,230
我相信她有我可以利用的情报
I believed she had information I could exploit.

520
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,960
没别的原因
Nothing more.

521
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,340
那她有么?
And did she?

522
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,120
她有什么情报吗 洛林?
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

523
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,320
我得告诉你些事
There's something I need to tell you

524
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,120
和你的朋友珀西瓦尔有关
It has to do with your friend Percival.

525
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,330
洛林
Lorraine...

526
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,780
她有提供任何情报吗 洛林?
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

527
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,830
她给过你情报吗?
She gave you information?

528
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,800
她什么也没给我
She gave me nothing.

529
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,170
他妈的大卫・珀西瓦尔
David fucking Percival.

530
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,180
你跟踪我?
Are you following me?

531
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:40,120
你他妈还以为自己间谍当的挺好的吧
Maybe you're not as good at this spy shit as you think.

532
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,310
这下是替詹姆斯捅的 你这杂种
That was for James, you fucking prick.

533
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:49,260
现在把那份该死的名单给我
Now gimme that fucking list.

534
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:13,110
我们得告诉你一个消息 洛林
We needed to get you a message, Lorraine.

535
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,440
几天过去了 你一点线索都没有
There are several days on to a mission without a single lead.

536
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,840
还旁生许多枝节
And plenty of distractions.

537
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,850
我们必须提醒你发生这些事情的原因
We had to remind you of the cause it had.

538
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:25,040
哦 我收到你们的消息了
Oh. I received your message.

539
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,970
从这看挺壮观的
That's quite a view.

540
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,860
70英里的铁丝网
70 miles of barbed wire,

541
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:47,070
310个警戒塔 65条反装甲战壕
310 guard towers, 65 anti- vehicle trenches,

542
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:52,270
4万名训练有素全副武装的苏联边防军
40,000 Soviet trained heavily armed frontier troops.

543
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,330
面对这些
All that... and...

544
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:59,580
居然还有5千多名东德人敢外逃
five thousand GDR citizens still had the brass balls to escape.

545
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,130
你可没少让军情六处操心
You have got the MI6 a worry...

546
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,380
他们甚至找了CIA来帮你
They called the CIA to talk sense into you.

547
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:11,130
埃里克・格雷给我打了电话
Eric Gray called me.

548
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,590
他当然会打给你的
Of course he did.

549
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,860
不用我多说 你也知道时间紧迫吧
I don't have to remind you of how fast the clock is ticking.

550
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,560
一旦名单曝光
If that thing gets out...

551
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,660
很多辛勤工作的人
a lot of good hard working folks...

552
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,980
不论男女 都会因此而死
brave men and women, are gonna show up dead.

553
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,480
包括你我
You and I included.

554
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,550
我发誓 这几周
I swear to god the last few weeks..

555
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,300
我甚至每天早上一睁开眼就感到恐惧
I dreaded even waking up in the morning.

556
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,690
我知道形势很严峻
I understand the severity of the situations,

557
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,650
时间也很紧迫
and time imperative.

558
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,310
听着 我大老远过来可不是为了给你加油助威的
Listen, I didn't climb all the way up here just to give you some arousing pep talk..

559
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,730
我就直接说重点吧
So I'll cut to the chase.

560
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,180
你昨晚遇到的那个女的
Last night you met a woman.

561
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:54,410
德尔菲娜・拉萨尔那点儿本事在这可不够看
Delphine Lasalle is out of her depth.

562
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,110
在现在的形势下 我可不希望看到任务执行失败
Given the climate I hate to see an executive order come down the line

563
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,580
不过她可一点也不在乎这个
that falls in her disinterest.

564
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,450
她不在乎?
Her disinterest?

565
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:06,110
你说她不在乎是什么意思?
What do you mean her dis- interest?

566
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:10,590
这还需要问? 洛林 你能不知道我是什么意思?
Don't insult my intelligence Lorrain. You know exactly what the fuck I mean.

567
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,260
希望你拍张照片留念
Hope you get a snapshot.

568
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,820
下周这儿可就天翻地覆喽
Next week, this will be a whole different picture.

569
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,710
这个电话可改变你的一生
This call could change your life!

570
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:28,610
萨丘已经暴露了
Satchel has been compromised.

571
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,790
个人档案
PERSONAL PROFILE

572
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,320
萨丘 双面间谍
SATCHEL Double Agent

573
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:36,600
到奥兰尼亚街的同性恋酒吧见一面吧
Meet me at the Rough Trade Bar, Oraniastrasse.

574
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,220
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

575
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,080
看看隐于夜生活的柏林的另一面
Look at all these hiddenness.

576
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,770
就像个疯狂的美女 我他妈太喜欢这儿了
It's like a beautiful women gone wrong. I fucking love it.

577
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,720
听说巴赫金又出现了
Word is Bakhtin has resurfaced.

578
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,860
警察发现他脑袋上被开了个洞
Cops found him with a homemade lobotomy.

579
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,330
不管怎么样 我们都得解决小望远镜的问题
Either way, we have to deal with Spyglass.

580
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,890
好好想想 他那边也没多少时间了
Thinking it through, he doesn't have much time over there.

581
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,870
我们的首要任务是找到那份名单
Our priority is the list.

582
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,720
我们不能犯错 - 拜托
- We can't make mistakes. - Come on!

583
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,630
我的天 他是我认识的最值得信赖的人 我很少遇到像他这样的
He is hardly the most trustworthy person I've ever met, all the fucking Christ

584
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,880
等下 你说你从来没见过他
Wait, you said you hadn't met him.

585
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,490
我撒谎了
I lied.

586
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,400
他声称 他已经把整张名单都背下来了
And he claimes.. To have memorized the entire list.

587
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,540
他准备叛逃
He is ready to make the jump.

588
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:37,910
你相信他能记住所有的内容?
You believe he comitted the entire thing to memory?

589
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,710
是的 一字不差
Everything.

590
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:44,570
早知道是这样 我会把小望远镜放在任务首位
Had I known earlier I would have prioritized Spyglass.

591
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:48,120
这就意味着 他和那份名单同样重要了
His knowledge made him as valuable as the list.

592
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,240
我们本可以随时带走小望远镜的
We could have grabbed him at any time.

593
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,510
就因为珀西瓦尔一直不告诉我这个情况
Instead Percival kept it a secret,

594
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:55,680
使我们处于危险境地
putting us in a precarious position.

595
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,430
克格勃会派出手下
Look the KGB are gonna have some very angry bastards out there...

596
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:06,360
四处寻找小望远镜的下落
...looking for Spyglass.

597
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,990
我们不能按照老规矩或老办法来办这事
We can't trust any of the old rules or methods.

598
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:11,480
这几天想坐车越境也不是那么难
It's not that difficult to drive across the border these days.

599
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,560
如果你跟小望远镜一样被通缉 越境就难了
It is when you are wanted like Spyglass is!

600
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:19,440
我们必须在光天化日之下 亲自带他走过边境以确保其安全
We have to walk him across personally to ensure his safety in plain sight

601
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,550
我们要利用明天在亚历山大广场举行的示威游行
We'll use the demonstration tomorrow at the alexanderplatz in plain sight

602
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,750
你简直是疯了
That's insane.

603
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,890
那些示威者们会帮我们分散敌人的注意力
All those Protestants will make a great distraction.

604
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:31,190
小望远镜是由我负责的 我们得按照我的方法去做
Spyglass is my guy. We're gonna do it my way.

605
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:33,920
好吧
Fine..

606
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,530
但是得用我的关系网搞到越境所需的文件
But we use my contact to get all ours papers are in order.

607
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,380
可以
Alright.

608
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,000
说定了吗?
We have a deal?

609
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:46,910
不说话我当你同意了
I'll take that as a yes.

610
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,440
你要知道
You see...

611
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:03,460
那晚我接到了帕西瓦尔的电话 洛林
I received a call from David Percival, that evening, Lorraine.

612
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:12,400
他说他得到了那份名单
He said he had the list.

613
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,260
给我点时间 让我理解一下
I will need a little time to wrap it up.

614
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,500
他知道萨丘的真实身份
...and he knew the identity of Satchel.

615
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,540
我已非常接近萨丘了
Oh, I'm very close to Satchel.

616
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,520
居然没人想告诉我这些?
And no one thought to tell me?

617
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,040
妈的
Fuck!

618
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,600
你带了这么多人来啊
You brought a lot of friends.

619
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,010
我听说巴赫金出了点儿小意外
I heard Bakhtin had a little accident.

620
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:11,840
我听说他滑倒摔在了一个冰锥上
I heard he slipped and fell on an ice pick.

621
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,540
柏林像是个残忍的女人
Berlin is a cruel mistress.

622
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,010
尤其是对像巴赫金这样的叛徒
Especially for traitors like Bakhtin.

623
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,570
别跟我来共产党那一套 你有麻烦了
Don't be such a fucking communist, you have got a problem.

624
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,980
是的 我知道
Yeah I know.

625
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,480
那份名单在你手上
You have the fucking list.

626
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,190
我们敌对了这么久 都应该知道
We've been in the trenches long enough to know that

627
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,760
如今这世道 柏林有她自己的一套规则
in times like these, Berlin, has its own set of rules.

628
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,610
我可以给你情报
I can give you information...

629
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,800
可以保证双方处于制衡状态
that will keep the balance.

630
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,460
你现在到底跟不跟我合作
Now, are you in or out?

631
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:46,270
帕西瓦尔想陷害我
Percival is trying to set me up...

632
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:51,550
你很惊讶?
Are you surprised?

633
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,780
并不是
Not really.

634
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,800
特工之间的合作不过是虚与委蛇
These relationships aren't real.

635
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,600
只是为完成任务的手段罢了
They are just a means to an end.

636
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:05,150
当你讲真话时 你看起来不一样了
When you tell the truth, you look different.

637
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,540
你的眼神变了
Your eyes change.

638
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,260
谢谢你提醒我
Thanks for the warning.

639
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,490
什么意思? - 我的意思是我不会再犯这样的错了
- What do you mean? - I mean I better not do it again.

640
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,530
为什么?
Why?

641
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:30,240
因为将来有一天 我可能会为之丧命
Because it's going to get me killed one day.

642
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,630
禁止通行
NO ENTERING

643
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:39,200
东德
THE EAST

644
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,210
哇哦 不错哦
Well, I'm impressed.

645
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:54,490
我还以为默克尔没什么本事呢
Thought Merkel out here was just a good bartender.

646
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,430
你闻起来就像是个斯塔西特工
You smell like a Stasi officer.

647
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:11,360
刮掉胡子
Shave off the mustache.

648
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,630
用西德产的香皂和香水
Use the soap and colognes from the west.

649
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,880
东德这边的东西你都不能带走
You can't take anything from the east.

650
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,940
默克尔会给你拿些衣服
Merkel will give you some clothes.

651
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,340
这边走 小望远镜先生
Right this way Mr. Spyglass.

652
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:28,820
布雷莫维奇说那个叛徒就在那栋楼里
Bremovych says the traitor is in that building.

653
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,880
保持警惕
Stay alert.

654
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,720
这本应该很容易的
It should have been easy.

655
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,810
计划很周全
Plan was sound..

656
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:06,140
无论是哪出了差错 肯定是有人故意为之
Whatever went wrong did so because someone wanted it to.

657
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,750
而且罪魁祸首还是内部人员
Someone from the inside.

658
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,900
你是被自己人出卖了
You were betrayed by a fellow agent.

659
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,990
你说的是萨丘
You mean Satchel.

660
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,660
这种事又不是没发生过
Would that be unheard off?

661
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,460
根据您的要求
As per your request.

662
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,620
你并不需要枪
You won't be needing that.

663
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,270
如果他们发现你有枪情况会更糟
It will be worse if they find it on you.

664
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,200
其他的都准备就绪了吗?
Everything else ready?

665
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,560
是的 都是按照您的吩咐办的
Yes, everything you requested.

666
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,480
我准备好了
I'm ready.

667
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:39,950
你觉着他这衬衫怎么样?
What do you think of his shirt?

668
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:43,090
我可不想死的时候穿着这件衬衫
I wouldn't be caught dead in it.

669
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:45,620
但是对他来说挺完美的
But for him it's perfect.

670
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,640
站到这边
Stand over here.

671
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,100
表情自然点儿
Now look like a free man.

672
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:58,850
这些柏林青年领袖们本周末在亚历山大广场组织了
These Berlin youth leaders have organised

673
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:02,340
一场示威游行
a demonstration this week at Alexanderplatz.

674
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:10,260
他是不是跟你说我记住了名单的所有内容?
Did he tell you that I memorized the whole list?

675
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,260
是的
Yes.

676
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,060
我知道对于某些人来说 我并不是那么重要
I realize I may not be as valuable to some people and

677
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,050
甚至有些人想要杀死我 但是...
Some people may even want me dead but...

678
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,420
我能有什么选择?
What choice do I have?

679
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,640
你死了对我一点好处也没有
You are no good to me dead.

680
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,480
而我从未失手过
And I've never lost a package.

681
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,720
我知道
I know.

682
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:44,250
这是他的家人
It's his family.

683
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,890
这事不在我的计划之中
This was not part of the plan.

684
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,700
我的计划里有
Part of mine.

685
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,050
拜托了
Please.

686
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,000
我负责带走他的妻女
I will take the wife and the kid.

687
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,570
你只需要保护好小望远镜
You will just have to deal with Spyglass.

688
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,600
我不知道护照够不够用
I don't know if I have enough passports.

689
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,730
珀西瓦尔
Percival.

690
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:05,760
你的王牌特工
Your golden boy..

691
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,420
你现在必须听妈妈的话
You must listen to your mother now.

692
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,680
做个坚强的女孩儿
Be my strong girl.

693
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,480
我爱你
I love you.

694
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,540
我们必须出发了
We have to go.

695
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:46,480
西德见 祝你好运
See you in the west. Good luck.

696
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,150
他们刚从楼里出来了
They just left the building.

697
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,730
我们要自由选举
We want free elections

698
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,440
40米了 还在靠近
40 meters and closing.

699
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,780
我看到他们了
I have them in sight.

700
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,740
怎么回事?
What's happening?

701
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,220
我看不到他们了
I've lost them!

702
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,520
事先计划里并没有这部分
This was never part of the plan.

703
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,530
我的计划里有
It's part of mine..

704
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,190
全是雨伞 我什么也看不见
It's the umbrellas. I can't see anything.

705
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,050
我也看不见
Neither can I!

706
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:02,530
谁能看见他们? 回话
Who can see them? Report!

707
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,920
人太多了
There are too many people.

708
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,080
我开了一枪
I have a shot.

709
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,090
打中目标了吗?
Is the target down?

710
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,540
看不清楚 我们得转移了
No visual. We need to move.

711
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:40,120
别起来
Stay low.

712
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:47,450
进去
In here.

713
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,010
我们得先给你止血 否则不可能越过边境
We need to deal with this now or we will never get to cross.

714
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,980
我不想死 - 你不会死的
- I don't want to die. - You are not going to die.

715
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,930
呆在这
Stay here.

716
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:42,170
用无线电呼叫支援
Get on the radio!

717
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,520
正在努力
I'm trying!

718
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,130
快点
Hurry!

719
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,380
她在这儿 速来支援
She's here. Hurry!

720
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:01,790
妈的
Fuck!

721
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:17,070
两个 还有两个
Two more. Just two more.

722
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,800
不要
Wait!

723
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,660
别开枪
Don't shoot!

724
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,720
走
Go!

725
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,160
你需要止血
You need to stop that bleeding...

726
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,370
去找找任何有帮助的东西
Search for anything...

727
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:13,500
酒 碎布
alcohol, rags.

728
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,630
受死吧 臭婊子
Take that, bitch.

729
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,850
还敢叫我婊子吗?
Am I a bitch now?

730
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,160
站住 你们在这干什么呢?
Stop! What are you doing here?

731
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,930
请等一下
Just a minute, please.

732
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:38,730
把手放到脑后
Hands behind your head!

733
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:40,140
趴到地上
Get down!

734
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,530
马上趴下
Right now!

735
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:43,170
上车
Get in!

736
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:45,790
上车
Get in!

737
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,250
你得好好练练德语
You need to work on your German.

738
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:01,660
讲的太烂了
It's horrible.

739
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:05,530
我操
Fucking hell.

740
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:56,310
系上安全带
Fasten your seatbelt.

741
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:47,070
- 你没事吧 - 我没事
- Are you allright? - Yeah

742
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,020
我们得走了
We have to go...

743
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,120
太冷了 - 打开车门
- It's so cold! - Open your door!

744
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,750
我的脚 卡住了
My foot... It's stuck!

745
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,140
我动不了了 - 深呼吸
- I can't move. - Just breathe.

746
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,920
我的腿
My leg!

747
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:35,470
你需要休息一会儿吗? - 不
- You need a break? - No!

748
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,640
那么
So...

749
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:48,740
好吧 我想我知道全过程了
Yes, I think I understand everything.

750
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,350
你制定了计划
You made your plan.

751
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,830
但却失败了
You failed to get the...

752
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:55,450
你没能把这位极度重要的情报人员安全带到西德
high value asset safely across to the west.

753
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,930
你他妈把我派进了一个马蜂窝里
You sent me in to a fucking hornet's nest.

754
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:04,160
我刚下飞机就被克格勃的人认出来了
I was made by the KGB from the moment my feet touched the ground.

755
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,190
他们甚至可能早就知道了我的身份
Maybe even before.

756
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:10,190
你早就知道了 对吗?
You knew that. Didn't you?

757
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:13,580
你也怀疑珀西瓦尔
You had your doubts about Percival.

758
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:17,410
所以你利用我去试探他
And you used me to shake him down.

759
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,610
洗耳恭听
Ready when you are.

760
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,400
嘿!是我!
It's me, it's me!

761
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,610
他死了
He's dead.

762
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,240
小望远镜死了
Spyglass is dead.

763
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,440
但你还活着
And you're alive.

764
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,410
你没听懂我的意思
You aren't listening to me.

765
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,820
他们知道了
They knew..

766
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,170
克格勃的人什么都知道了
The KGB knew everything.

767
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,490
我需要离开这里
I need to get across.

768
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,590
扬
Jan.

769
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,930
我需要用车
I need the car.

770
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:38,810
您好啊 大使
Good day, Ambassador.

771
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,980
谢谢你
Thank you.

772
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,570
请节哀
My condolences

773
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:05,590
我本以为英国佬们能搞定这件事 结果搞得一团糟
I expected more out of the Brits, and a wild goatfuck.

774
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,640
我知道 抱歉了
I know, we're sorry.

775
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,640
不 等等 等一下 你们没在斯塔西安插人吗？
No wait, your lot don't have your own private stasi agent, do you?

776
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,640
可他们没一个有过目不忘的能力
Not one with a photographic memory.

777
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:22,130
我们得注意布劳顿
We need to get with Broughton.

778
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:23,190
了解那个计划的所有情况
Get on the same page.

779
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,530
我们需要那份名单
We need that list.

780
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:26,800
现在就要
Now more than ever.

781
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,450
布劳顿
Broughton.

782
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:31,630
她成功逃了出来
She made it out.

783
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:34,700
真的吗?
Really?

784
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,200
你知道吗
You know...

785
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,290
大卫 一个意大利美女曾经对我说过 大卫
Beautiful Italian girl once said to me, David...

786
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,980
你永远不能改变已经发生过的事情
You can't unfuck what's been fucked.

787
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:49,500
女人办事总拖后腿 对吧
Women are always getting in way of progress, aren't they?

788
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:55,970
今晚发生了一件所有德国人都不会相信的事
What no one in Germany believed possible has happened tonight...

789
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:58,620
柏林墙倒了 真的倒了
The wall is coming down, the wall is down.

790
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:02,380
从1961年起那面墙下就伴随着我们的生活
We are in there living with the wall since 1961 and...

791
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:06,220
所以 我觉得现在是时候推倒它了
I think now it's time to break the wall down, you know.

792
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,490
当那面墙粉碎时
The wall is crumbling.

793
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:14,390
这些年轻人都出生于柏林墙建成之后 他们用锤子敲猛力敲击墙面
The sledgehammers in the hands of men not born when it went up tear into it.

794
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:17,660
墙后的东德士兵还试图阻止
Behind it, the East German soldiers tried to stop...

795
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:21,910
高压水枪都出动了 西柏林人表现地很是坚决
water cannons were brought out, but the west Berliners were determined.

796
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,410
一个西柏林人喷洒香槟以示回应
One west Berliner sprayed champaigne back.

797
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,460
我很负责的告诉你 如果是我跟踪你
If I was to follow you, I mean, properly,

798
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,800
你永远都发现不了
You would never fucking know.

799
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,090
柏林人等了28年就为这一天
It is the moment Berliners have waited 28 years for.

800
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,210
甚至东德人都显得很兴奋
Even the East Germans seem exhilarated.

801
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:41,150
柏林墙的建立导致了千百人的死亡
A symbolic breach in the structure that cost hundreds of lives...

802
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:45,680
使得亲朋爱侣分离数十年 柏林墙的倒下极具历史意义
and separated friends, families and lovers for decades.

803
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:51,040
小望远镜死后 我在他的大衣口袋中找到了一个法国特高频发信装置
Found a French UHF device in my coat after Spyglass died.

804
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:54,180
现在我觉得这窃听器是珀西瓦尔放在我外套内的
I now believe it was Percival who planted it.

805
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,100
而且要让它看起来像拉萨尔做的
Made it look like Lasalle.

806
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,280
你为什么在这
Why are you here?

807
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,040
你得离开柏林
You need to leave Berlin.

808
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:29,140
没有了你的消息 我很担心
When I didn't here from you, I got worried.

809
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:32,030
别这么幼稚
How naive can you be?

810
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,250
我们选择了这种生活 德尔菲娜
We chose this life, Delphine.

811
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,350
这种生活只会有一种结局
This only ends one way.

812
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:40,580
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

813
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:46,390
我们都进了他的圈套了
He set us both up.

814
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,880
在你能走的时候赶紧走
You have to leave while you can.

815
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,290
别低估我 珀西瓦尔
Don't underestimate me, Percival.

816
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:19,620
哦 拉萨尔 你要仔细听我说
Oh. Lasalle, listen to me very carefully!

817
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:22,020
你根本不知道你在跟谁打交道
You have no idea who you are dealing with...

818
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,910
你给我下套
You set me up.

819
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:25,580
得了吧 这游戏就是这么玩的
Come on now, this is the game.

820
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,510
我知道你的秘密 大卫
I know your secrets, David.

821
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:31,030
而且这个游戏我玩的 比你想象的要好
And I can play this game better than you think.

822
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:26,430
珀西瓦尔试图陷害我
Percival is trying to set me up.

823
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,080
你惊讶吗
Are you surprised?

824
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,530
并不
Not really.

825
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,900
特工之间的合作不过是虚与委蛇
These relationships aren't real.

826
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,360
只是为完成任务的手段罢了
They are just a means to an end.

827
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:37,910
当你讲真话时 你看起来不一样了
When you tell the truth, you look different.

828
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:39,650
你的眼神变了
Your eyes change.

829
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:42,120
谢谢你提醒我
Thanks for the warning.

830
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:48,110
什么意思? - 我的意思是我不会再犯这样的错了
- What do you mean? - I mean I better not do it again.

831
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:49,550
为什么
Why?

832
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:52,870
因为将来有一天 我可能会为之丧命
Because it's going to get me killed one day.

833
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,620
我有些事情需要告诉你
There's something that I need to tell you.

834
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,570
一定和你的朋友珀西瓦尔有关吧
It has to do with your friend Percival.

835
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,180
他...
He...

836
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,390
对不起 亲爱的
Sorry darling!

837
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:51,240
这就是游戏规则
This is the game.

838
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,200
我去
Fuck!

839
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,200
今晚的街道上庆典将会继续
The celebrations continue in the streets tonight...

840
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,300
从第一波东德人穿过柏林墙开始
from the moment of first wave of East Germans crossing through Berlin

841
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:55,350
数千人喝着香槟 一起狂欢
They have been showered with champagne and cheered by a crowd of thousands.

842
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:59,270
很明显 这将会是东德最激动人心的日子之一
It is clear. This will be one of Berlin's most dramatic days.

843
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:02,160
当西柏林人从边境涌入时 东柏林人显得十分热情
East Berliners are overcome as they cross the border..

844
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,320
这条边境整整封闭了28年
That has been closed to them for 28 years.

845
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:09,810
西柏林人凿穿了那面荼毒了他们城市的墙 然后推倒了它
West Berliners are chipping through wall that scar their city and scaling it.

846
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:27,520
警察再也不会来干涉他们了
There is no more interfarence from the police.

847
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,220
东西柏林人和平地团结在了一起
Unified Berliners laced up with the peace

848
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:34,320
数千名示威名着魔似的呼喊着“再无柏林墙”
Thousands of the mutinees, enchanting it, "Down with the wall."

849
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,330
所以现在只有一个问题
So only one question after you ask...

850
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,540
这次事件中 到底谁才是真正的胜利者
Who won?

851
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:05,890
这所谓的游戏到底是什么
And what was the fucking game anyway?

852
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:10,170
我曾以为这面墙永远不会倒呢
I was thinking the wall will never fall...

853
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:15,240
德国的和平变革
Germany's peaceful revolution..

854
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:31,230
要想赢的话
To win...

855
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:34,570
首先你必须明确你的立场
First you have to know which side you are on..

856
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:42,770
在我们的工作中
In our line of work...

857
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:45,280
有许多阴暗面
That's right up there with black holes.

858
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:47,970
追随你选择的道路一直到底
All to be or not to be.

859
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,990
你以为你在为正义而战 忽然有一天你清醒了
You fight the good fight and then one day you wake up..

860
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:55,790
你会意识到自己是撒旦的使者 不过在传播毁灭而已
And you realize that all you were was satan's little helper.

861
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,880
真是讽刺啊
Ironic.

862
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:21,150
新闻告诉公众 不会再有秘密了
The news will them there will be no more secrets.

863
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:25,490
但你和我都知道这不是真的
But you and I, we both know that's not true.

864
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:29,860
这个世界永远存在着秘密
The world is run on secrets.

865
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,590
拥有这份名单的人将拥有权利
Whoever has that list has power...

866
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,790
没有它 你不过就是另一个目标罢了
And without it, you're just another fucking target..

867
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:51,790
所以经历了这一切之后我又学到了什么吗
So what have I learned after all this time?

868
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:54,920
那所有的无眠之夜
After all those sleepless nights.

869
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,970
那些对朋友 对爱侣 甚至对自己的欺骗
Lying to friends, lovers, myself.

870
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:01,290
在这个扭曲的城镇玩这些扭曲的游戏
Playing this crooked game in this crooked town..

871
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:04,560
充满了恶意中伤和狡诈的谎言
Filled with backstabbers and full fledged lies.

872
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,910
我要告诉你 我在这所明白的 唯一一件事
I'll tell you what I've learned, one thing and one thing only.

873
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:13,100
我热爱着柏林
I fucking love Berlin!

874
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:39,450
你不必杀了她的
You didn't have to kill her.

875
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:43,000
在你做过那些事之后
You suddenly decided to develop a conscience

876
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:45,380
你怎么突然良心发现了
after all you've done.

877
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,910
希望你注意到 每一个跟你接触的人
Hope you noticed how everyone you get close to..

878
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:49,930
都以死亡收场...
Ends up fucking dead...

879
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:53,160
你把计划的细节透露给布雷莫维奇
You gave Bremovych the details of the plan.

880
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:56,590
你想借克格勃的手来干掉我
You wanted the KGB to take me out.

881
01:36:57,550 --> 01:37:00,970
是啊 你太害怕了 不敢自己动手了
- Yeah. - You're too fucking scared to do it yourself.

882
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:07,060
如果这帮克格勃的废物把你搞定了
If those KGB pricks done their part.

883
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:10,250
那我现在就能受到女王的接见了
I'd be on my way to handjob with the queen by now.

884
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:13,020
我已经读过那份名单
I have read that list.

885
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,080
洛林
Lorraine.

886
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:23,640
原来你是这么淘气的女孩
Turns out you've been a very naughty girl.

887
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,900
小望远镜对我们来说是个累赘
Spyglass was a liability to us all.

888
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:30,200
我不能冒险让他留在你身边
I could not risk leaving him with you.

889
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,920
名单在哪 大卫
Where is the list, David?

890
01:37:32,370 --> 01:37:34,050
不在我手上
I don't have it.

891
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:37,660
它正在前往军情六处的路上
It's enroute to MI6, where it belongs!

892
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,400
到现在你还打算撒谎吗
Are you going to lie to the very end?

893
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,950
真相与谎言
Truth and lies...

894
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:07,700
我们这样的人总是很难看出两者的区别
People like us don't know the difference.

895
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:10,130
不 我们知道它们的区别 大卫
No, we know the difference, David.

896
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:12,950
我们只是选择去无视它
We choose to ignore it.

897
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:16,780
不是吗 萨丘同志
Isn't that right comrade Satchel?

898
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,510
原来你准备这么干
So that's how you make it work?

899
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:23,580
欺骗欺人者 其乐无穷
It's a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.

900
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:25,680
干的漂亮
Well played.

901
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:45,010
你杀了大卫・珀西瓦尔
You killed David Percival.

902
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:48,650
詹姆斯・加斯科涅和大卫・珀西瓦尔
All the paperwork are in order

903
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:52,000
尸体和文件手续都准备好了
for the bodies of James Gascoigne and David Percival.

904
01:38:54,970 --> 01:38:58,780
你杀了柏林情报站的负责人  一名宣誓效忠女皇陛下的特工
You killed our head of station, an officer of the crown.

905
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,300
你最好有确凿的证据和充足的理由
You better have hard proof and a damn good explanation.

906
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,930
你有什么资格来审判我 我是你的上级
- Who are you to judge my actions? - I'm your superior.

907
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:14,650
我的上级
My superior..

908
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:18,590
这次任务和阻止冷战没有任何关系
This was never about stopping the war.

909
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:21,770
而是为了保住你的位置
...was about saving your ass.

910
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:24,980
我们在冷战中犯下的罪行 要是暴露出去
You couldn't bear the embarrassment

911
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:28,450
会让你十分难堪
of the sins that we committed in the Cold War.

912
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:31,570
我是多么愚蠢啊 竟然愿意为之卖命
And I was stupid enough to give my life for it.

913
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:32,930
好吧
Yes, well...

914
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,710
这就是你的工作 不是吗
That's your job, isn't it?

915
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,180
我完成了我的工作
I did my job.

916
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:43,930
虽然你在我的背后捅刀子 而且能力极其低下
Despite your backstabbers and your incompetence..

917
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:47,370
我完成了你搞不定的任务
I succeeded where you failed.

918
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:51,740
我把内部的叛徒 萨丘 揪了出来
I uncovered your traitor Satchel.

919
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,990
给了唯一配得上他的结局
Brought him the only justice he deserved.

920
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:00,100
死亡
A bullet!

921
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:05,790
就在小望远镜被杀前一天珀西瓦尔见了布雷莫维奇
Percival meeting with Bremovych. The day before Spyglass was killed.

922
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:09,610
或许我们可以做一些准备
Maybe we can make some sort of arrangement

923
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:13,100
你要知道我是这里唯一一个能帮你拿到那份名单的人
..you've gotta know I am the only man in this town that can help you get that list.

924
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,570
我记住你了
Very impressive.

925
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:18,680
奉献 忠诚这些品质现如今都难能可贵
Dedication... loyality are rare thing these days.

926
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:22,590
欺骗欺骗者 其乐无穷
It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.

927
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:28,970
成交吗
We have an deal?

928
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,460
那这位英国小姐怎么想的呢?
What about the British?

929
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,690
你信任格雷吗?  并不
- Do you trust Gray? - No.

930
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:36,730
那C长官呢?
What about C.?

931
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,800
C长官是个自大的哈巴狗
C is a arrogant lab dog

932
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:47,950
珀西瓦尔就是萨丘
Percival was Satchel.

933
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,830
那名单在哪?
Where is the list?

934
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:58,690
名单在哪? 洛林
Where is the list, Lorraine?

935
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:01,390
我不知道
I don't know.

936
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,260
扯淡
Oh, bollocks.

937
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,270
首相最近可不会好过了
The Prime Minister's gonna have a difficult time with this.

938
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:16,260
我们决定隐瞒这个任务 布劳顿
We are choosing to burry this one, Broughton.

939
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:18,960
你的任务从未发生
Your mission never took place.

940
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,250
这段对话
This conversation...

941
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,060
也从未发生
It never happened.

942
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:30,520
我打算让你休假一段时间 立即生效
I am putting you on leave effective immidiately.

943
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:34,480
你会开始一段新生活 好好休息
You will start the next decade.. Well rested.

944
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:37,490
C长官...
C..

945
01:41:39,290 --> 01:41:41,620
我该穿什么
What should I wear?

946
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:49,650
去和女王喝茶?
For my tea with the Queen?

947
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:14,590
三天后 巴黎
THREE DAYS LATER PARIS

948
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:40,840
萨丘同志
Comrade Satchel.

949
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,230
布雷莫维奇同志
Comrade Bremovych

950
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:02,680
名单
The list!

951
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,430
乖女孩
Good girl.

952
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:14,110
请允许我
Allow me.

953
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:21,180
今晚我们一醉方休
Tonight, we celebrate!

954
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,510
你没开玩笑?
Seriously?

955
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:48,450
有那么一刻我认为你想杀了我
For a moment, "I thought you wanted to kill me.

956
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:04,460
珀西瓦尔告诉我你的真实身份了
Percival told me who you are.

957
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:26,480
干这行
Be a professional...

958
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:28,850
就要准备随时进尸体袋
Get started on the plastic.

959
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:04,140
你真的认为我会把名单给你?
Did you really think I was going to give you that list?

960
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:09,430
在你死前 我想让你那迟钝的脑袋明白
Before you die, I want to get this through your thick primitive skull.

961
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:13,910
我从未为你工作
I've never worked for you.

962
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:16,750
你却一直在为我卖命
You worked for me.

963
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:25,050
我给你的每一个假情报
Every false intel I gave you...

964
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:27,490
都在铁幕上撕开一道裂缝
A rip in the iron curtain.

965
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:33,690
你给我的每一个情报都化作我枪膛里的一颗子弹
