GUNSMITH: He got Rictus.
Perfect shot. Impossible angle.

497
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,289
Cross is taking us out one by one.

00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:28,464
And Wesley is the only one
who can get to him.

499
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,635
Cross gets closer with each hour.

- Okay.

I want you to try and catch it.

504
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:50,153
You want me to stick my hand in there?

Yeah. It's my room.

No.

This was your father's room.

SLOAN: A member
of this fraternity went rogue.

562
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:20,631
WESLEY: Cross.

563
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:27,013
He started by killing
the one man who was better than him.

564
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:29,724
Your father.

565
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,520
Blindsided him on a rooftop.

566
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:36,856
Betrayed him.

567
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:42,153
Everything in this room,

568
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:45,823
books, weapons, clothes,

569
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:48,159
belonged to him.

570
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,244
Now they belong to you.

571
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:54,165
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

572
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,711
It may be the only way
of finding out who you are.

573

WESLEY: Now I know why I could never care
about anything before this.

574
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:25,154
I was living a lie.

575
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:30,326
Finally, I have a chance to step
into my father's shoes.

576

Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.

I've been pissing it all away
like it was another fucking billing report.

578
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,670
I have to train harder.

I have to be as good as my father.

580

On these shelves, Wesley,
are the records of the Fraternity kills,

581
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,272
everything you will need to kill your target.

582
00:48:59,355 --> 00:49:01,899
WESLEY: To kill Cross,

583
00:49:01,983 --> 00:49:06,779
the man who betrayed the Fraternity
and murdered my father, I must prepare.

584
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:11,200
I have to become his student,
memorise every move he ever made,

585
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:13,703
every attack he ever executed.

586
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,882
When he dropped a patient in an airtight
room surrounded by Secret Service agents.

587
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:28,759
When he took out that
businessman in the elevator.

588
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:30,970
His bullets untraceable, of course.

589
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:38,060
Or how no matter what the weapon
or how he eliminated his target,

590
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:42,315
he was always one chess move ahead.

591
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:45,610
One move more prepared.

592
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,778
One step quicker.

593
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:49,822
One shot more precise.

594
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:54,952
In fact, in all my research,
I found that he never missed a target.

595
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:57,371
Not until me.

SLOAN: We call this the Loom of Fate.

00:54:09,408 --> 00:54:13,954
After today,
you will never set foot in here again.

609
00:54:14,037 --> 00:54:15,372
Why not?

610
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:17,833
Because, like an apostle,

611
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:22,587
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.

612
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:28,260
Every culture in history has a secret code,

613
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:31,430
one you won't find in traditional texts.

614
00:54:32,723 --> 00:54:34,808
A thousand years ago,

615
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:39,229
a clan of weavers discovered
a mystical language hidden in the fabric.

616
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:44,109
They called themselves the Fraternity.

617
00:54:44,192 --> 00:54:46,820
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.

618
00:54:47,946 --> 00:54:49,322
Come here.

619
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,828
Look there.

620
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:58,040
Do you see that one thread
that missed the weave

621
00:54:58,123 --> 00:54:59,666
and lies on top of the others?

622
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,794
- Like a mistake?
- No, it's a code.

623
00:55:03,712 --> 00:55:07,049
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.

624
00:55:08,175 --> 00:55:10,510
If it's below, it's a zero.

625
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:13,138
Binary code?

626
00:55:13,722 --> 00:55:15,140
What does it say?

627
00:55:15,891 --> 00:55:17,392
It's a name.

628
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,728
A target.

629
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,191
Where do the names come from?

630
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:27,819
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.

631
00:55:27,903 --> 00:55:30,947
A necessity to maintain balance
in the world.

632
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,201
They are orders that must be executed,

633
00:55:34,618 --> 00:55:40,082
entrusted to us so that we
might forge stability out of chaos.

634

This one is yours.

635
00:55:48,757 --> 00:55:50,175
I don't...

636
00:55:52,052 --> 00:55:54,763
Look, I thought you brought me here
to kill Cross.

637
00:55:54,846 --> 00:55:56,139
You will.

638
00:55:56,223 --> 00:55:57,599
In time.

639
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:01,353
This is your first assignment.

640
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:03,605
The loom provides,

641
00:56:03,689 --> 00:56:05,607
I interpret,

642
00:56:05,691 --> 00:56:06,900
you deliver.

643
00:56:08,193 --> 00:56:10,529
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?

644
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:14,449
Not me.

645
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:17,119
Fate.

646
00:56:24,543 --> 00:56:28,380
FOx: The target will be in the conference
room, sitting at the head chair.

647
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:30,382

664
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:03,100
About 20 years ago,

665
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,520
there was this girl.

666
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:10,607
Her dad was a federal judge,

667
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:15,404
so she probably had it in her mind
that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.

668
00:58:20,826 --> 00:58:23,078
So she's home one Christmas,

669
00:58:23,161 --> 00:58:26,164
and her dad's on this big racketeering case.

670
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:29,501
The defendants want to get a softer judge.

671
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,962
One they can buy off.

672
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:35,048
So they hire this guy,

673
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:38,135
Max Petridge,

674
00:58:39,636 --> 00:58:42,180
get him to pay her father a visit.

675
00:58:45,267 --> 00:58:47,936
And the way he pays people a visit

676
00:58:49,855 --> 00:58:50,897
is to break in

677
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:52,024

678
00:58:52,816 --> 00:58:55,235
And tie up their loved ones,

679
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:57,612
and force them to watch

680
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:01,324
while he burns his targets alive.

681
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:14,004
And then he takes a wire hanger
and twists it round

682
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,843
and brands his initials into each
one of them so they will never ever forget.

683
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:27,559
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,

684
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:30,979
I found out that Max Petridge's name
had come up

685
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:34,316
weeks before the federal judge was killed,

686
00:59:35,025 --> 00:59:39,196
and that a Fraternity member
had failed to pull the trigger.

the ripples of our decisions go.

WESLEY: This is not me.

981
01:41:35,337 --> 01:41:37,881
This is just a motherfucking decoy.

982
01:41:44,513 --> 01:41:45,889
Oh, fuck.

WESLEY: This is me taking control.

985
01:41:54,231 --> 01:41:55,857
From Sloan,

986
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,527
from the Fraternity,

987
01:41:58,902 --> 01:42:02,406
from Janice, from billing reports,

988
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:05,200
from ergonomic keyboards,

989
01:42:05,283 --> 01:42:08,954
from cheating girlfriends
and sack-of-shit best friends.

990
01:42:10,747 --> 01:42:13,583
This is me taking back control

991
01:42:14,334 --> 01:42:15,877
of my life.

992
01:42:19,548 --> 01:42:21,925
What the fuck have you done lately?
