3
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:44,996
一千年前...

4
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,783
织布人部落建立了一个暗杀组织

5
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:55,303
他们为了重建世界的秩序 在混乱边缘执行任务

6
00:00:56,768 --> 00:01:01,099
他们自称为"兄弟会"

7
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,424
六周前...

8
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:14,837
# 祝你生日快乐 亲爱的珍妮丝 #
# Happy birthday, dear Janice. #

9
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,506
# 祝你生日快乐! #
# Happy birthday to you! #

10
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,638
今天是我那个厌食症老板的生日
It's my anorexic boss' birthday.

11
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:27,408
这就意味着在办公室的时候要承受无比巨大的压力...
This means there's a certain amount of inter-office pressure...

12
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:29,507
来站在这个会议桌旁...
to stand around the conference table...

13
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:32,971
吃着恶心的食物 还得装出一副尊敬她的样子
eating crappy food and pretending to worship her.

14
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,002
这个真好吃
That's so good.

15
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:40,434
假装五分钟 珍妮丝并没有让我们的生活很糟糕
Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable,

16
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:43,231
那只不过是我一天中最艰难的工作罢了
is the hardest work I'll do all day.

17
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:51,861
我工作的职位名称叫客户经理
My job title is account manager.

18
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:56,030
其实以前我被叫做客户服务代表
I used to be called an account service representative,

19
00:01:56,124 --> 00:01:59,540
但是一个咨询顾问说 我们应该管理我们的顾客...
but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients...

20
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:01,502
而不是服务他们
and not service them.

21
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,545
我有一个既不能管理也不能服务的女友
I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service.

22
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:14,257
这是我最好的朋友拜瑞 正在宜家餐桌上干她
That's my best friend, Barry, fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table.

23
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,973
我可是花了好价钱买了那张餐桌
I picked up for a really good price.

24
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:22,432
我最近觉得很难去在乎什么事情
I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days.

25
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:27,768
事实上 我唯一在乎的事就是我不在乎任何事这一现状
In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything.

26
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,571
说真的 这让我很困扰
Seriously. It worries me.

27
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:33,609
我的名字叫韦斯利・吉布森
My name is Wesley Gibson.

28
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:41,241
在我七天大的时候 我父亲就离开了我
My dad walked out on my mom when I was seven days old.

29
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:46,080
有时候我在想他到底有没有过望着我蓝色的眼睛问问自己
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,

30
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:51,919
"我是刚刚做了21世纪最无关紧要的人的父亲吗?"
"Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century?"

31
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:11,772
如果你能在二十八号之前把我的委托物给我的话... 是的
Well, if you could get me the consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah.

32
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,326
你面前有号码吗?
Do you have the numbers in front of you?

33
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,577
放松
Relax.

34
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:30,791
如果你的名字出现了的话 你已经死了
If your name had come up, you'd be dead already.

35
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,469
最近出现了一些意想不到的失误
We've had some unexpected losses recently.

36
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,972
我们想知道...
We'd like to know...

37
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:42,977
我们的敌人是从哪里得到军火的
where our competitor is getting his munition.

38
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,489
这个子弹很干净
It's clean.

39
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,151
什么意思?
Meaning?

40
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,698
意思就是难以追踪
Meaning it's untraceable.

41
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:00,488
你的对手非常聪明
Your competitor's very smart.

42
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:02,950
趴下!
Get down!

43
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:21,837
该死
Fuck it.

44
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,007
没人能离开兄弟会 克洛斯
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.

45
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:54,557
我对兄弟会有了新的看法
I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.

46
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,107
小心点儿
Careful.

47
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:00,106
你没办法毁掉已经存在上千年的东西的
You don't destroy something that's been around for a thousand years.

48
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:03,148
兄弟会已经毁了 他坏了规矩
It's already destroyed. He broke the code.

49
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,399
我要阻止这一切
I have to stop this.

50
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,448
- 真的吗?  - 你自己知道的
- Really?  - You know this.

51
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,069
那你为什么不来当面见我?
So why don't you face me yourself?

52
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,289
你这是送羊入虎口
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

53
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:19,961
他们只不过是诱饵
They were just the decoys.

54
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,292
再见 X先生
Goodbye, Mr X.

55
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,413
你这是送羊入虎口
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

56
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,660
他们只不过是诱饵
They were just the decoys.

57
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,327
韦斯利!
Wesley!

58
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,545
怎么了?
What is it?

59
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,507
什么叫"怎么了"? 你听听
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.

60
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,879
这么吵 我怎么睡得好?
Well, how am I suppose to sleep with all that fucking racket?

61
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:18,385
你到底打算什么时候才搬家 好让我们不用每天早上被这玩意儿吵醒?
When are we gonna move so we don't have to wake up to that shit?

62
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,188
我还挺喜欢的
I kind of like it.

63
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,147
这该死的声音能够盖过你心中焦虑的声音
It helps to drown out the sound of your annoying, fucking voice.

64
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,359
拜托了 再让我睡会儿
Now, please, let me sleep.

65
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,853
你到底有没有考虑过我们的谈话?
Have you even thought about our talk?

66
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,028
考虑过
Yes.

67
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,778
哪一次?
Which one?

68
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,327
很好 真的太好了
Perfect. That's perfect.

69
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,741
记得喂安娜贝尔
Feed Annabelle.

70
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,243
抱歉
Sorry.

71
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,583
哦 我了个去
Oh, my fucking God.

72
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:35,461
我希望你桌子上的那个不是我的财务报表
I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk.

73
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:38,009
真不巧啊 还真是
Holy shit on an altar, it is.

74
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,803
我希望一个小时后这份报表能出现在我的桌上
I want that report on my desk in one hour.

75
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:45,427
好吧 各位 我们还要再加班一个小时...
Okay, everybody, we're all gonna stay an extra hour...

76
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,515
想要听点儿坏消息吗?
Want to hear something sad?

77
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:52,270
我还得买个人体工学键盘来控制我的重复压力性损伤
I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.

78
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:56,906
就是因为这些我来回念叨的小事而倍感压力真的是太悲哀了
Just the fact that I repeat something enough that it causes me stress is fucking sad.

79
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:59,280
干得好 兄弟 你看到拜瑞了吗?
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?

80
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,158
他"又"去看牙医了
He had to go to the dentist. Again.

81
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:06,114
太棒了!
Yes!

82
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:08,616
拜瑞!
Barry!

83
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:15,122
你说他们这儿有紧急避孕药吗?
You think they have that morning-after pill here?

84
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,796
那个很有用的 碾碎了 然后放到她的煎蛋卷里
That thing works. Crush it up, put it in her omelette,

85
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:20,753
"嘿 宝贝 在床上吃早餐哦" 简直安全的不得了
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed." You can never be too safe.

86
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:22,307
天啊
Oh, God.

87
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:25,592
我把钱包弄丢了
I lost my wallet somewhere.

88
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,431
一起算吗?
All this together?

89
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,184
- 不用 不用了  - 一起
- No, no.  - Yes.

90
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:35,730
他真够哥们儿
He is the man.

91
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,146
- 总共多少?  - 哦 加上这个
- How much is it?  - Oh. Plus this.

92
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:40,527
二十块四毛二
$20.42.

93
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,071
西瓜味儿
Watermelon.

94
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,037
小弟弟最爱
Chicks dig it.

95
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:50,074
谢谢
Thanks.

96
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:51,624
下次见
See you next time.

97
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:52,791
晚安
Have a good night.

98
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,422
我超爱这种能量饮料 兄弟
I love these energy drinks, man.

99
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:57,460
感觉能量饮料能让我净化
I'm almost, like, kind of on an energy drink cleanse,

100
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:00,670
我早餐喝一瓶 午餐喝两瓶或者三瓶
where I do one for breakfast and then, like, two or three for lunch.

101
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,043
我够哥们儿?
I'm the man?

102
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,380
是啊 没错 拜瑞 我够哥们儿
Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.

103
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:05,884
说真的 我实在是太够哥们儿了
In fact, I'm so much the man,

104
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:10,683
我有一张长期药物处方 以此来控制我的焦虑症
I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks.

105
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,858
天啊 我希望有别的什么能缓解我的压力
God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress.

106
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:15,518
你好 韦斯利
Hello, Wesley.

107
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:21,315
总有那么些人 很漂亮的人
You know, there are people, beautiful people,

108
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:25,155
你希望她们以不同的眼光 不同的立场来看你
you just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place,

109
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:27,700
而不是看你在哪儿 你会成为什么人
instead of where you are, what you've become.

110
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:29,496
妮可真够正点
Nicole is so hot.

111
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,239
什么?
What?

112
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:35,202
炸弹就要爆炸了
Boom goes the dynamite.

113
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:38,166
但更多时候 你都在希望自己别这么磨叽...
But most of all, you wish you weren't such a pussy...

114
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:41,376
老是想一些不可能改变的事情
for wishing for things that will never change.

115
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:47,054
我全能的神啊 你就跟发春一样站在那儿
Good God Almighty, you're over here like it's spring fucking break,

116
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,429
而我还没拿到我的财务报表
and I still don't have that billing report.

117
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,091
我为什么还让你呆在这儿 韦斯利?
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?

118
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:54,521
我马上做好 珍妮丝
I'll get it done, Janice.

119
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:58,106
说得好像你以前没跟我说过这话似的 "我马上做好"
Like I never heard that before. "I'll get it done."

120
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,441
"我马上做好 我马上做好 珍妮丝"
"I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice."

121
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,273
"我马上做好"
"I'll get it done."

122
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,912
怎么不帮你自己说几句话?
Why don't you have anything to say for yourself?

123
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,917
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

124
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:23,092
你真的一无是处
Well, you're worthless.

125
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:26,176
我才是很抱歉的那一个 抱歉雇佣了你这么个废物
I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.

126
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:55,113
你知道一天结束时最好的事是什么吗?
You know what the best thing is about the end of the day?

127
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:58,161
那就是明天一切重新来过
Tomorrow it starts all over again.

128
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,261
余额不足 你是个废物 对/不对

129
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:47,361
你破产了 最好的朋友上了你女朋友 你知道 却窝囊得什么都干不了 对/不对

130
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,021
- 嗨 你好吗?  - 很好
- Hi. How you doing?  - Good.

131
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:27,617
- 不好意思?  - 你说抱歉说太多了
- I'm sorry?  - You apologise too much.

132
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,341
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

133
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,558
我认识你父亲
I knew your father.

134
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:50,020
我父亲在我出生后一周就走了 所以...
My father left the week I was born, so...

137
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,809
听着 这边有很多酒精饮料 所以...
Look, the liquor rounds are just over there, so...

138
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,453
你父亲曾经是世界顶尖的暗杀者之一
Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived.

139
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:10,165
杀了他的那个男的就在你后面
The man who killed him is behind you.

140
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,322
这人刚刚开枪了...
This guy's just shooting up...

141
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:39,708
对不起 对不起
Sorry. Sorry.

142
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:09,566
什么... 哦 我的天! 我的天啊! 刚刚到底发生了什么?
What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What the fuck just happened?

143
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,578
拜托了! 拜托了! 拜托再开快点儿
Please! Please! Please drive faster.

144
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,541
- 拜托你安静点儿  - 再开... 再开快点儿
- Please be quiet.  - Please drive... Please drive faster.

145
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:21,080
拜托... 拜托你要理解我是很惜命的!
Please... Please understand that I care about my life!

146
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,468
我不知道你到底是怎么惹了那个家伙
I don't know what the fuck you did to piss this guy off,

147
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,716
但是你得让我下车 然后去报警!
but you're gonna have to let me out and call the cops!

148
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:34,757
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

149
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:42,272
你要干嘛? 哦 该死! 你疯了吗?
What are you doing? Oh, shit! Are you crazy?

150
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,567
哦 该死
Oh, shit!

151
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,952
我想我们甩掉他了 我们甩掉他了
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.

152
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,206
能不能在下个拐角处放我下去?
Could you let me out at the next corner, please?

153
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,907
该死!
Shit!

154
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:04,912
靠!
Fuck!

155
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:09,092
哦 该死!
Oh, shit!

156
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:12,965
他就在那儿!
He's right there!

157
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,485
听着 我是个会计 我就是一会计
Look, I'm an accountant. I'm just an accountant.

158
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,565
我靠!
Oh, fuck!

159
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,782
他可真他妈的执着
He's fucking persistent, you know.

160
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,368
靠!
Fuck!

161
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,665
快点好好教训他!
You kick his ass!

162
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:53,841
打他啊!
Shoot him!

163
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:59,006
你在干嘛? 你干嘛打咱们车的玻璃 哈?
What are you doing? What are you shooting our car for, huh?

164
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,515
- 你疯了吗?  - 抓着方向盘
- Are you crazy?  - Grab the wheel.

165
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,016
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

166
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:09,353
快回来!
Get back in here!

167
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:13,490
天啊!
Oh, my God!

168
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,212
该死! 对不起
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.

169
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:42,267
- 枪!  - 什么?
- Gun!  - What?

170
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,603
在座位下面?
Under the seat!

171
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:47,804
给
Here.

172
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:15,753
哦 我靠!
Oh, shit!

173
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:20,255
我靠!
Shit!

174
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:27,467
- 小心!  - 让开!
- Look out!  - Get out!

175
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:29,805
小心! 哦 我的天!
Look out! Oh, my God!

176
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,143
我靠!
Shit!

177
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:43,985
对不起!
I'm sorry!

178
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,181
小心后面!
Behind you!

179
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,303
操
Fuck.

180
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,271
该死 该死
Shit. Shit.

181
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,556
你好
Hello.

182
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,852
我没钱也...
I don't have any money or...

183
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,898
我本以为...
I thought he'd be...

184
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:49,609
他会更高
taller.

185
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:52,065
更高?
Taller?

186
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,656
先生...
Sir...

187
00:21:55,582 --> 00:22:00,078
先生 我昨天就试着向这位女士解释我是个会计了
Sir, I've been trying to explain to the lady here that I'm an accountant.

188
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,869
我是个客户服务代表... 是个客户经理
I'm an account service representative... I'm an account manager.

189
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:06,918
我相信如果你打给我的老板珍妮丝的话
And I'm sure that if you call my boss, Janice,

190
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,879
无论什么误会 她都能解释清楚的
she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.

191
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:13,220
你可以给她发邮件或者... 她会解释清楚的
You can contact her by email or... She'll put you straight.

192
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:15,549
打掉苍蝇的翅膀
Shoot the wings off the flies.

193
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,759
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what that means.

194
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:22,729
打掉苍蝇的翅膀
Shoot the wings off the flies.

195
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,981
我真的觉得你把我和别人搞混了
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else.

196
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:33,903
我数三下
On three.

197
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,699
你开枪 或者我开枪
Either you shoot, or I do.

198
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:49,211
一
One.

199
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:53,507
好吧
Okay.

200
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:01,217
二
Two.

201
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:03,351
我看都看不见他们!
I can't even see them!

202
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,147
三
Three.

203
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,207
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

204
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,349
那根本不可能
That's impossible.

205
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:54,894
在今天之前 很多事情对于你来说都是不可能吧
A lot of things for you weren't possible before today.

206
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:58,906
你所感受到的 并不是什么恐慌症
What you experienced, Wesley, was not a panic attack.

207
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:03,361
你的心跳达到每分钟四百以上
Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute,

208
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:06,160
如此高的心率可以将大量的肾上腺素输送进你的血液
sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your bloodstream.

209
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,416
这也让你能够比平常人有更快的反应能力
This allows you to see and react faster than normal.

210
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:12,420
这世界上仅有一少部分人能做到
Only a few people in the world can do that.

211
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,833
你父亲可以 你也可以
Your father could do it and you can do it.

212
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:20,336
只要一点训练 你就能学会控制这种力量
With a little work, you can learn to control these attacks.

213
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,221
离我远一点
Stay away from me.

214
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:24,384
后退
Just stay back from me.

215
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:26,765
我拿着枪呢 先生 对吧?
I have a gun, sir. All right?

216
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,390
我叫斯隆
My name is Sloan.

217
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,733
这位是福克斯
This is Fox.

218
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:36,484
这周围的所有人都精于刺杀
And the others you see around you are all very good at killing.

219
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,896
所以 如果我是你 我会用枪指着我
So, if I were you, I'd keep the gun pointed at me.

220
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,029
你不会想瞄准他们中的任何一个的
You don't wanna point it at any of them.

221
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:42,695
这样好多了
That's better.

222
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,196
- 你疯了  - 没有
- You're insane.  - No.

223
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:46,362
你的血管里流淌着杀手的血液...
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing...

224
00:24:46,455 --> 00:24:48,827
浪费生命对你来说才是真正的疯狂
when you have the blood of a killer flowing in your veins.

225
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:52,415
你就像是笼中猛兽 只需要一把释放你的钥匙
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,

226
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:54,954
但你不重视你的能力 不利用你的能力...
coasting through life in a miserable existence...

227
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:59,128
最终只能悲惨的过完人生 你才是疯了
when you have a caged lion locked inside and a key to release it.

228
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:04,680
你拿着的这把枪是今西17号 它曾经属于你父亲
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17. It belonged to your father.

229
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:08,678
他甚至能用这把枪指挥交响乐团
He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it.

230
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:12,767
而你 将会拿着这把枪杀掉那个冷血杀死你父亲的人
And you're going to use it to kill the man who shot him down in cold blood.

231
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:16,604
- 我不能...  - 和昨晚想杀你的是同一个人
- I can't...  - The same man who tried to kill you tonight.

232
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,567
你父亲是我们的一员
Your father was one of us.

233
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:25,440
我们是暗杀组织 是命运的武器
A fraternity of assassins. The weapons of fate.

234
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,954
我们已经将他所有的财产转移给你了
We've transferred all of his assets over to you.

235
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,456
我向你保证 财产相当丰厚
And let me assure you, they are substantial.

236
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:39,128
这是你等待已久的命运...
It is your long-awaited destiny...

237
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:40,674
加入我们吧
to join us.

238
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:55,428
后退 后退
Back off. Back off.

239
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,647
你根本不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

240
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:02,821
离我远点儿 离我远点儿
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

241
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:05,028
你不离我远点儿吗?
You stay away from me?

242
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:08,366
能不能离我远点儿? 能不能让我过去?
You stay away from me, please? Will you let me through?

243
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:43,309
你有没有过那种做梦做到一半然后突然醒来
You know when you have a dream and you're half awake,

244
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:45,442
而那个梦还在你脑中盘旋的感觉吗?
but it's still in the fringe of your brain?

245
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,313
然后你睁开眼睛 庆幸刚刚那是梦
Then you open your eyes and you're so damn glad it was a dream.

246
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:59,123
根本不是这么回事儿
This was nothing like that.

247
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,647
对不起 能不能先让我用下? 谢谢
I'm sorry. Could you just give me one second? Thank you.

248
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,611
该死
Oh, shit.

249
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,295
韦斯利
Wesley.

250
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,257
你怎么了?
What's up with you?

251
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,552
你什么意思啊?
What do you mean?

252
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,938
你... 你今天来得很早
You're... You're here early.

253
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:07,684
你... 你看起来很有精神
Is... You seem a little pepped up.

254
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:10,267
- 你还好吗?  - 当然 我很好
- You all right?  - Well, yeah.

255
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:12,358
很好
Yeah.

256
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,983
我觉得我自己...
I guess I feel...

257
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:17,949
有那么点儿不一样了
kind of different.

258
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:21,122
好吧 我打算去拿点儿便利贴 你要吗?
Whatever. I'm gonna go get some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?

259
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,284
- 不要  - 真不要?
- No.  - Really?

260
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,116
- 真的  - 好吧
- Yeah.  - Okay.

261
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:41,971
我的苍天啊 我还没拿到我的财务报表
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle, I still don't have my billing reports,

262
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,977
但你还有空坐在这儿查你那些狗屁玩意儿
but you've got time to sit here and Google your ass off.

263
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:46,604
好吧 我只知道一件事
Well, I know one thing.

264
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:49,144
下个礼拜你就会拿到你的评估
You've got your review coming up next week,

265
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:53,561
我已经迫不及待想勾全了那些选项
and I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes.

266
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,654
态度 差评! 表现 差评!
Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!

267
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:59,990
业务能力 差评!
Management skills, poor!

268
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:03,362
合作能力强 简直就是个笑话
Works well with others. That's a fucking joke.

269
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:07,119
这是什么破玩意儿? 这混蛋是谁?
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?

270
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:10,163
某些衰人在中央大楼上被爆头...
Some loser gets his head blown off at the Metropolitan...

271
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:12,460
给我闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up!

272
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,928
她也就有那么一点微不足道的力量
She has one single iota of tenuous power.

273
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:26,851
就想让每个人都听她的
She thinks she can push everyone around.

274
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,098
你不需要这玩意儿
You don't need this.

275
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,855
我理解你
I understand.

276
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:40,693
你的初中生活一定很辛苦
Junior high must have been kind of tough,

277
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:44,401
但并不代表你有权利把你的员工当畜生 珍妮丝
but it doesn't give you the right to treat your workers like horseshit, Janice.

278
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:46,867
我知道大家都在嘲笑你 珍妮丝
I know we laugh at you, Janice.

279
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:50,872
我们都知道你把果冻面包圈放在最上面的抽屉里
We all know you keep your stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk.

280
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,035
但是我想让你知道...
But I want you to know...

281
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:57,673
如果你没这么贱的话 我们都会觉得很抱歉
if you weren't such a bitch, we'd feel sorry for you.

282
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:02,045
我会为你感到抱歉
I do feel sorry for you.

283
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:05,884
但是现在的情况是 你的表现
But as it stands, the way you behave,

284
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:09,678
我觉得我可以代表整个办公室的人...
I feel I can speak for the entire office...

285
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:12,138
对你说...
when I tell you...

286
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:14,980
去你妈的
go fuck yourself.

287
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:32,499
真棒 兄弟 谁是真汉子?
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?

288
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,499
操你妈

289
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,081
我是
I'm the man.

290
00:30:52,965 --> 00:30:54,081
摄像头拍下嫌犯面容

291
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:58,081
通缉令

292
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,120
这是个坏主意
That's a bad idea.

293
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,965
找不到你的钥匙了吗?
Couldn't find your keys, huh?

294
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,794
这会经常用到 你会教我的对吗?
That could be handy. You going to teach me that?

295
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,593
我会需要的
I might need that.

296
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,841
你叫"福克斯" 对吧? 这是什么? 是代号吗?
So, Fox, right? What is that? Is that a call sign?

297
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,638
就像"壮志凌云"(汤姆・克鲁斯主演电影)里的小牛?
Is it like Maverick in Top Gun?

298
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,760
你要是告诉我 就得杀了我?
You could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?

299
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,647
开玩笑的
I'm just kidding.

300
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:21,713
十七号纺织厂

301
00:32:51,468 --> 00:32:52,713
彼得!
Peter!

302
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:58,848
检查一下这台机床梭子的转速 应该是每分钟三百转
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB. It should be 300 per minute.

303
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:02,477
这种棉织品 反向线应该是四千根
This kind of cotton weave, the opposing thread count should be 4,000.

304
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,978
嘿 真了不起 是吧?
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?

305
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,943
这是幌子吗?
Is it a front?

306
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:13,525
- 什么的幌子?  - 我不知道
- Front for what?  - I don't know.

307
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:15,157
杀手组织的
Assassinations.

308
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:19,404
你也许以为这是幌子
You may think this is a front for something,

309
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:23,247
我只能告诉你这是一个纺织厂
all I can tell you is this is a textile mill.

310
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:26,249
乔治... 乔治 去给彼得解释一下
And George... George, go help Peter up there.

311
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:27,449
好的
Yeah.

312
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,794
这是家纺织厂
This is a textile mill.

313
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,370
而且很不错
And a damn good one.

314
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:35,254
真棒 不过这是废话吧?
Yeah, that's cute, but that's bullshit, right?

315
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:38,595
我是说 这些人都是杀手吧 对吗?
I mean, all these guys are killers, aren't they?

316
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,056
我觉得你该回答我几个问题
I think you owe me some answers.

317
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:46,229
好吧 我显然是不懂
All right. Clearly I don't understand,

318
00:33:46,313 --> 00:33:49,148
你们是做毛衣的还是杀人的?
but do you make sweaters or do you kill people?

319
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:12,795
喝杯咖啡的时间可回答不了这么多
That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.

320
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,012
你真的准备好听答案了吗?
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?

321
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,759
是的
Yes, I'm sure.

322
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,512
我没法回头了
I can't go back.

323
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:30,264
回到原来的生活
Not to my life.

324
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,396
他归你了
He's all yours.

325
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:39,148
好 咱们走
All right. We're up.

326
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,536
你好吗?
How you doing?

327
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:54,247
我是"维修员"
I'm The Repairman.

328
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,080
你修什么?
What do you repair?

329
00:34:56,464 --> 00:35:00,509
一辈子的坏习惯
A lifetime of bad habits.

330
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:03,006
- 好吧  - 你帮我个忙好吗?
- Okay. - Would you do me a favour?

331
00:35:03,095 --> 00:35:05,670
把你的手放到身后
Just put your arms behind your back.

332
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:08,173
- 没事的  - 我不懂...
- It's okay.  - I don't know...

333
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:09,928
- 放到背后就行  - 这样?
- Just behind your back.  - Is this okay?

334
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,348
放松
Just relax.

335
00:35:11,438 --> 00:35:13,180
这也是训练?
Is this part of it?

336
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:15,816
我们开始吧
There we go.

337
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:20,569
- 你要在我头上套个袋子?  - 不 不用袋子
- You going to put a bag over my head?  - No. There's no need for a bag.

338
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:23,857
- 不会太紧吗?  - 不 这样很好
- That's not too tight, is it?  - No, that's nice.

339
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:34,661
你为什么来这里 韦斯利?
Why did you come here, Wesley?

340
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:37,539
是你带我来的 你忘了?
Well, you brought me here, remember?

341
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,919
你他妈的干什么...
What the fuck did you do that...

342
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:57,534
"维修员"打了他几下...
How many punches did The Repairman throw...

343
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:59,891
他就晕过去了的?
before he was counting sheep?

344
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:05,567
以前我不被经常打脸 明白吗?
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having my face smashed in before, all right?

345
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:10,200
- 你用刀的次数多吗?  - 早饭 中饭和晚饭时都用
- Did you spend a lot of time with knives? - At breakfast, lunch and dinner.

346
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:12,735
我靠
Fuck.

347
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:19,033
刚才那是个反问句 蠢货
It was a rhetorical question, culo.

348
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:22,413
你要是再插嘴 我就用刀刃了
You interrupt me again, I use the business end.

349
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,298
现在你需要听好了 
Here's what you need to know, puto.

350
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,590
刀子很容易隐藏
Knives are easy to hide.

351
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:32,263
它们不会卡壳 也永远不会用光子弹
They don't jam and they never run out of bullets.

352
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:35,926
当你要做近距离接触的任务时...
They come in handy...

353
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,641
刀子是非常好用的
when you have to do some close contact work.

354
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,522
老兄 你干吗?
What the fuck, man?

355
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:50,488
- 过来 过来  - 啥?

试着砍我 嘿!
Try to cut me. Hey!

358
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:02,372
- 就用那个捅我...  - 你当心点 这刀很快
- Just stick me with that...  - Be careful with that. That's sharp.

359
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,464
- 你就捅啊捅啊捅  - 为什么?
- Just stick and stick and stick.  - Why?

360
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,122
- 说真的 老兄 我可能会弄伤你  - 喂!
- Seriously, man, I could hurt you.  - Hey!

361
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:10,127

363
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:13,762
- 不 我不是胆小鬼  - 你就是胆小鬼!
- No, I'm not a pussy.  - You're a pussy!

364
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:16,849
我不是胆小鬼 我只是在意你的健康状况
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect for the human condition.

365
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,642
- 放屁 胆小鬼!  - 我不是胆小鬼!
- Fuck that, you pussy!  - I'm not a pussy!

366
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:19,890
- 你就是胆小鬼!  - 我不是胆小鬼!
- You're a pussy!  - I'm not a pussy!

367
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:22,434
- 来吧 胆小鬼  - 我不是胆小鬼!

370
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,455
操!
The fuck!

371
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,839
稍等一下 稍等一下
Just a moment. Just a moment.

372
00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:55,507

Sorry.

373
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:57,470

你一定要喝下去 喝下去 对

376
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,528
- 这是哪?  - 这里是康复室
- What is this? - This is the recovery room.

377
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:17,657
这种药浴可以刺激白血球 加快康复
This bath stimulates white blood cells and speed up the process.

378
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:21,243

In here, bruises, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days.

379

Get up.

383
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:34,793
这是"枪械师"
This is The Gunsmith.

384
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:39,879
他对枪械的了解比任何人都多 他会教你怎么用枪
He knows more about a piece than anybody, and he's gonna teach you how to use one.

385
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:42,262

388
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,229
- 怎么弄的?  - 从大楼上跳下来摔的

- 那他还好吧?  - 还行 不过伤势挺重的
- So, is he okay?  - Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.

390
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,276
天啊
Oh, my God.

391
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,952
天啊 这做得太像真的了
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.

392
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:07,031
他已经在康复室呆了三天
He's been in recovery for, like, three days now,

393
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,244
他们说还不能让他出来
and they say they're not even gonna let him out.

394
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:21,421

天啊!
Oh, my God!

397
00:39:26,017 --> 00:39:29,433
我们不能开枪打死掉的女人! 也许她是什么人的妈妈...
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman! She might be somebody's mom...

398
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:35,265
你必须了解子弹打在人身上是什么样的
You need to know what it's like to put a bullet in a body.

399
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:37,522
你为什么来这儿?
Why are you here?

400
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,568
你知道 我以为我是来学习当超级刺客的
You know, I thought I was learning to be some kind of super assassin.

401
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:45,263
如果我想挨揍
You know, if I wanted to get beat up,

402
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:48,288
我就会呆在自己的小办公室隔间里了
I would have stayed in my cubicle, you know.

403
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:56,750

From there.

406
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:17,776
- 你要我射穿死猪?  - 我要你让子弹拐弯
- You want me shoot through Wilbur?  - I want you to curve the bullet.

407
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:20,977
我怎么才能做到?
How am I suppose to do that?

408
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:23,278
这不是怎么做的问题
It's not a question of how,

409
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:25,696
而是做什么
it's a question of what.

410
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:28,951
如果没有人告诉你子弹是走直线的...
If no one told you that bullets flew straight ...

411
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:31,243
我给你一把抢 让你去射目标
and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target,

412
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:33,075
你会怎么做?
what would you do?

413
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,450
让你的本能引导你
Let your instincts guide you.

414
00:40:50,642 --> 00:40:52,848
他到底怎么做到的?
How the hell did he do that?

415
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:55,722
你能做到吗? 你能做到吗? 喂?
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?

416
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:01,852
嘿 我觉得那火车我上去过
Hey, I think that's my old train.

417
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:03,320
你还得上
Still is.

418
00:41:12,455 --> 00:41:15,207
操! 你混蛋!
Shit! You fucking asshole!

419
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,666
来吧!
Come on!

420
00:41:21,088 --> 00:41:22,416
我们走
Let's go.

421
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:24,914
你是不是疯了?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

422
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:39,471
天啊 天啊 天啊
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

423
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,122
天啊 我觉得... 我觉得... 我觉得...
Oh, God, I feel... I feel... I feel...

424
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,413
我觉得还不错
I feel kind of good.

425
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:16,551
他干掉了里克特斯 完美的一枪 不可思议的角度
He got Rictus. Perfect shot. Impossible angle.

426
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,175
克洛斯正在一个一个地杀我们
Cross is taking us out one by one.

427
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:28,353
韦斯利是唯一能杀掉他的人
And Wesley is the only one who can get to him.

428
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:32,527
每过一个小时 克洛斯都会离我们进一步
Cross gets closer with each hour.

429
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,694
回去工作
Get back to work.

430
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:41,362
看见没?
See that?

431
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,748
- 是个梭子  - 对
- It's a shuttle.  - Okay.

432
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,327
我要你想办法抓住它
I want you to try and catch it.

433
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:50,048
你要我把手伸进去?
You want me to stick my hand in there?

434
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:52,256
对 我要你抓住它
Yes. I want you to catch it.

435
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:03,430
你要不要拿枪顶住我的头?
You wanna put a gun to my head?

436
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,400
我眼里的东西就会像苍蝇一样变慢
I can just slow things down like with the flies.

437
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:08,516
你必须学会自己控制这种能力
You need to learn to control that by yourself.

438
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,992
操 操 操!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

439
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,790
这真扯淡! 去他妈的!
This is bullshit! Fuck this!

440
00:43:38,304 --> 00:43:40,262
今天怎么样了 韦斯利?
How's it going today, Wesley?

441
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:43,349
不好 去他妈的织布机 去他妈的维修员!
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!

442
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:47,267
我能打掉苍蝇的翅膀! 我已经准备好了!
I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly! I'm ready!

443
00:43:47,355 --> 00:43:49,644
等到福克斯说你准备好了 你才算是准备好了
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.

444
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:52,188
- 谁让她负责的?  - 我
- Who put her in charge?  - I did.

445
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,478
韦斯利
Wesley.

446
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:06,204
别人都以为要抓这些小美人得用奶酪
People think you use cheese to catch these beauties.

447
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,994
其实它们见到花生酱就会发疯
But they go ape-shit for peanut butter.

448
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:13,702
你父亲特别爱玩这个 看好
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch.

449
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:19,928
塑性炸药和花生酱!
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!

450
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:22,298
抱歉 小老鼠
Sorry, Mickey.

451
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:27,058
五 四 三 二 一
Five, four, three, two, one.

452
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,060
嘿 嘿 俄罗斯人
Hey. Hey, Russian.

453
00:44:39,488 --> 00:44:41,198
这一只很不错
Good for one. Yeah.

454
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:44,399
要是有一千只会怎样?
Imagine if you had a thousand.

455
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:49,206
他们也狠狠地整过你 对吗?
They really fucked you up, didn't they?

456
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:52,033
他们对你做过什么?
What the hell did they do to you?

457
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:55,536
无缘无故把你扔到高速火车上?
Throw you in front of a moving train for no reason?

458
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,706
把你打得满地找牙?
Beat the shit out of you?

459
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:03,875
你可以说 这是个鬼地方
You know, you can say it, this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?

460
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:05,299
操蛋!
Bullshit!

461
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:16,271
维修员 五分钟后见
Repairman. Five minutes.

462
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:21,145
你就不能提醒我一下?
Heads up out of the question?

463
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:28,197
我靠
Fuck.

464
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:30,693
你他妈的在浪费我的时间! 你为什么来这儿?
You're a waste of my fucking time! Why are you here?

465
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:32,781
我不知道 揍我吧
I don't know, so hit me.

466
00:45:42,092 --> 00:45:45,756
- 你为什么来这儿?  - 我活得一团糟 为什么不来这儿?
- Why are you here?  - I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I?

467
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:49,844
我要好好揍你一顿!
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

468
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,677
告诉我你要我说什么
Tell me what you want me to say.

469
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:55,259
- 你为什么来这儿?  - 我不知道!
- Why are you here?  - I don't know!

470
00:45:58,274 --> 00:45:59,981
你为什么来这?
Why are you here?

471
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,690
- 你为什么来这儿?  - 我不知道!
- Why are you here? - I don't know why I'm here.

472
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:05,486
你为什么来这?
Why are you here?

473
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,731
你为什么来这?
Why are you here?

474
00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:12,864
我不知道我是谁
I don't know who I am.

475
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:20,123
- 你说什么?  - 我说...
- What did you say?  - I said...

476
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:23,336
我不知道我是谁
I said I don't know who I am.

477
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:40,646
你真的想知道自己是谁?
Do you really want to know who you are?

478
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:54,778
这是我的房间
Yeah. It's my room.

479
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,575
不
No.

480
00:46:58,332 --> 00:47:00,490
这是你父亲的房间
This was your father's room.

481
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:15,216
出了什么事?
What happened?

482
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,851
"兄弟会"的一名成员叛变了
A member of this fraternity went rogue.

483
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:20,509
是克洛斯
Cross.

484
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,890
他一开始就杀了一个比他优秀的人
He started by killing the one man who was better than him.

485
00:47:28,153 --> 00:47:29,611
你父亲
Your father.

486
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,398
在屋顶上偷袭他
Blindsided him on a rooftop.

487
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,736
背叛他
Betrayed him.

488
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:42,030
这个房间里的一切
Everything in this room,

489
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:45,708
书 武器 衣服
books, weapons, clothes,

490
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:48,039
都是他的
belonged to him.

491
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,123
现在归你了
Now they belong to you.

492
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,052
在房间里找找你和他的联系 韦斯利
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

493
00:47:55,388 --> 00:47:58,591
这可能是唯一知道你是谁的方法
It may be the only way of finding out who you are.

494
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:22,282
现在我知道了为什么我以前对什么事都不在乎
Now I know why I could never care about anything before this.

495
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:25,039
我生活在谎言中
I was living a lie.

496
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:30,209
我终于有机会穿上父亲的鞋子
Finally, I have a chance to step into my father's shoes.

497
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:33,796
成长起来 过我天生该过的生活
Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.

498
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:38,804
我之前还一直在逃避它 把它当成了又一份该死的结算报告
I've been pissing it all away like it was another fucking billing report.

499
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:40,548
我要更加努力训练
I have to train harder.

500
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,214
我要想我父亲一样优秀
I have to be as good as my father.

501
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:55,857
韦斯利 这些架子上放的 是"兄弟会"的刺杀记录
On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the Fraternity kills,

502
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:59,150
刺杀目标所需的一切都在这里
everything you will need to kill your target.

503
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:01,779
要杀克洛斯
To kill Cross,

504
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:06,660
这个背叛兄弟会 杀害我父亲的家伙 我必须做好准备
the man who betrayed the Fraternity and murdered my father, I must prepare.

505
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:11,077
我必须成为他的学生 记住他的每一次行动
I have to become his student, memorize every move he ever made,

506
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:13,578
他的每一次刺杀
every attack he ever executed.

507
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:25,758
他曾经在被特工处包围的密闭房间里杀掉了一个病人
When he dropped a patient in an airtight room surrounded by Secret Service agents.

508
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:28,638
他曾经在电梯里干掉了那个商人
When he took out that businessman in the elevator.

509
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:30,851
当然了 他的子弹是无迹可寻的
His bullets untraceable, of course.

510
00:49:33,315 --> 00:49:37,942
不管他消灭目标时用的是什么武器什么方法
Or how no matter what the weapon or how he eliminated his target,

511
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:42,193
他总是技高一筹
he was always one chess move ahead.

512
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,492
多留一手
One move more prepared.

513
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:47,661
多行一步
One step quicker.

514
00:49:47,914 --> 00:49:49,705
多中一枪
One shot more precise.

515
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:54,829
事实上 我研究了那么多材料 发现他在杀人时从不失手
In fact, in all my research, I found that he never missed a target.

516
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:57,255
除了杀我那次
Not until me.

517
00:51:04,737 --> 00:51:05,900
是的!
Yeah!

518
00:51:53,701 --> 00:51:57,948
你这辈子第一次能掌控全局了 韦斯利
First time in your life, Wesley, you're in control.

519
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:37,944
射击目标
Shoot the target.

520
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,334
你疯了
You're crazy.

521
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,421
欢迎加入兄弟会
Welcome to the Fraternity.

522
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,065
我们叫它"命运织布机"
We call this the Loom of Fate.

523
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:13,751
过了今天 你就再也不能走进这里
After today, you will never set foot in here again.

524
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:15,165
为什么?
Why not?

525
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:17,629
因为你就和耶稣的门徒一样
Because, like an apostle,

526
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:22,381
你的任务不是解密 而是执行
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.

527
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:28,058
历史上每一个文明都有一套密码
Every culture in history has a secret code,

528
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:31,228
那是在传统文字中找不到的
one you won't find in traditional texts.

529
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:34,598
一千年前
A thousand years ago,

530
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:39,020
一群织布工发现织物中隐藏着一种神秘的语言
a clan of weavers discovered a mystical language hidden in the fabric.

531
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:43,899
他们自称"兄弟会"
They called themselves the Fraternity.

532
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:46,612
跟你说实话 我只看见一根根线
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.

533
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,121
过来
Come here.

534
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,620
看那里
Look there.

535
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:57,876
你有没有看见有一根线没有织进去...
Do you see that one thread that missed the weave...

536
00:54:57,922 --> 00:54:59,464
盖住了其他线?
and lies on top of the others?

537
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:02,585
- 这是出错了?  - 不 这是密码
- Like a mistake?  - No, it's a code.

538
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:06,843
如果垂直线在上 那就是一
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.

539
00:55:07,973 --> 00:55:10,298
如果在下 那就是零
If it's below, it's a zero.

540
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:12,935
二进制代码?
Binary code?

541
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,931
这说明什么?
What does it say?

542
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,182
名字
It's a name.

543
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:19,519
目标
A target.

544
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:23,985
那些名字是哪来的?
Where do the names come from?

545
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:27,611
是由必然产生的 韦斯利
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.

546
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:30,737
为了平衡这个世界的必然
A necessity to maintain balance in the world.

547
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:33,992
它们是必须被执行的命令
They are orders that must be executed,

548
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:39,872
我们被赋予在混乱中创造平静的使命
entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos.

549
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,416
这个是你的
This one is yours.

550
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:49,966
我不明白...
I don't...

551
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,554
我以为你带我来这里 是让我杀克洛斯
Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.

552
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:55,924
你会的
You will.

553
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,395
等时间到的时候
In time.

554
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:01,139
这是你第一个刺杀任务
This is your first assignment.

555
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,392
纺织机提供任务
The loom provides,

556
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:05,395
我来解密
I interpret,

557
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,685
你去执行
you deliver.

558
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,315
你要我去杀罗伯特・狄恩・达顿?
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?

559
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,240
不是我要
Not me.

560
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:16,909
是命运
Fate.

561
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,171
目标将会在会议室里坐在主席座上
The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair.

562
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,169
一共有六扇窗户
There are six windows.

563
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,169
你从第五扇射击他
You will shoot through the fifth.

564
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:44,524
第五扇
Fifth window.

565
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,195
动手
Now.

566
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:19,637
他做错了什么 为什么得死?
What did he do that he deserves to die?

567
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:22,263
你不知道
You don't know.

568
00:57:23,313 --> 00:57:26,931
我不知道他是否做过坏事 是不是个坏人
I don't know if he was bad, I don't know if he was evil.

569
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:29,898
我对他一无所知
I don't know anything about him.

570
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:33,395
我们从个织布机得到命令
We get our orders from a loom.

571
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:35,397
是命运
Fate.

572
00:57:35,742 --> 00:57:40,071
我们必须坚信自己做得对
And we're supposed to take it on faith that what we're doing is right.

573
00:57:41,622 --> 00:57:44,327
杀掉毫不相识的人
Killing someone we know nothing about,

574
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,743
我觉得我做不到
I don't know if I can do that.

575
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:02,885
二十年前
About 20 years ago,

576
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:06,310
有个女孩
there was this girl.

577
00:58:07,439 --> 00:58:10,393
她爸爸是联邦法官
Her dad was a federal judge,

578
00:58:10,484 --> 00:58:15,193
所以她一直觉得自己也会成为一个那样的人
so she probably had it in her mind that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.

579
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:22,861
有年圣诞节 她一个人在家
So she's home one Christmas,

580
00:58:22,954 --> 00:58:25,956
她爸爸要去处理一起敲诈案
and her dad's on this big racketeering case.

581
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:29,291
被告想要换一个
The defendants want to get a softer judge.

582
00:58:29,753 --> 00:58:31,745
他们能买通的法官
One they can buy off.

583
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:34,837
所以他们就雇了一个人
So they hire this guy,

584
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:37,925
叫马科斯・佩特里奇
Max Petridge,

585
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:41,966
让他去找她爸爸
get him to pay her father a visit.

586
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,728
这家伙的拜访方式
And the way he pays people a visit

587
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:50,679
就是闯进他家...
is to break in...

588
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:55,016
把他的家人绑起来
and tie up their loved ones,

589
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:57,399
让他们看着...
and force them to watch...

590
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,104
他是如何被活活烧死的
while he burns his targets alive.

591
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:13,785
然后杀手拿来一个衣架...
And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it round...

592
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:19,629
把它扭成自己的名字 让别人永远都忘不了他
and brands his initials into each one of them so they will never ever forget.

593
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:27,343
我加入了兄弟会后
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,

594
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:30,762
我发现就在联邦法官被杀几星期前...
I found out that Max Petridge's name had come up...

595
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:34,104
马科斯・佩特里奇就已经是目标了
weeks before the federal judge was killed,

596
00:59:34,815 --> 00:59:38,979
但那个兄弟会成员却不忍心扣下扳机
and that a Fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger.

597
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:46,490
谁都无法知道自己的决定究竟会有多大影响
We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go.

598
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:51,037
杀掉一个人 或许
You kill one, and maybe,

599
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:53,457
会救了无数无辜的人
save a thousand.

600
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:57,373
这就是兄弟会的原则
That's the code of the Fraternity.

601
00:59:57,463 --> 01:00:01,046
也是我们的信念和动力
That's what we believe in, and that's why we do it.

602
01:00:22,196 --> 01:00:23,310
动手!
Now!

603
01:01:08,073 --> 01:01:09,353
克洛斯
Cross.

604
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:10,729
还不行
Not yet.

605
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:15,736
目标会乘坐一辆黑色豪华轿车
Your target will be in a black limo.

606
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,535
他总是经过霍尔斯特德街的六个街区
He always travels the same six blocks of Halsted.

607
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,664
你可以在其中的三条街杀了他
You have three blocks to kill him.

608
01:01:29,177 --> 01:01:30,375
该死
Shit.

609
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:15,629
不好意思
I'm sorry.

610
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:36,110
拜瑞! 能喂喂安娜贝尔吗?
Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?

611
01:02:37,076 --> 01:02:38,405
拜瑞!
Barry!

612
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:46,824
韦斯利 嘿 你去哪了? 我真的很想你 兄弟
Wesley. Hey, where have you been? I have really missed you, man.

613
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:53,041
看看谁来了 你个混蛋!
Look at the big man. You fucking asshole! What?

614
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:54,332
怎么? 你消失了几周
What? You don't show up for weeks,

615
01:02:54,427 --> 01:02:57,048
现在又突然出现 来上厕所?
now you're just gonna stop by and use the bathroom?

616
01:02:57,137 --> 01:02:59,629
你以为你很牛逼?
You think you're a real big shot now, huh?

617
01:02:59,723 --> 01:03:02,095
不 知道吗? 你就是个屁!
No. You know what? You are nothing!

618
01:03:02,184 --> 01:03:04,556
不 你连屁都不如
No, you are less than nothing.

619
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,938
你连拜瑞的一半都赶不上
You're not even half the man that Barry is.

620
01:03:08,399 --> 01:03:12,478
拜瑞 对我好到你都无法想象!
Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of!

621
01:03:16,572 --> 01:03:19,692
她是谁 韦斯利? 你的新马子?
Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore?

622
01:03:19,784 --> 01:03:23,035
就是因为她? 她是妓女吧?
Is that what it takes now? You're paying for it?

623
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:56,897
韦斯利?
Wesley?

624
01:03:58,406 --> 01:03:59,900
他才是真汉子
He's the man.

625
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:10,908
- 你还好吧?  - 嗯
- You all right?  - Yeah.

626
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:14,500
- 嗯 我没事  - 坐下 我去找辆车
- Yeah. I'm okay.  - Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.

627
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:17,422
总算过去了 我得恢复一下
Big night. I got to get into recovery.

628
01:04:33,773 --> 01:04:34,971
该死
Shit.

629
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,942
混蛋!
Fuck!

630
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,955
牛之眼
Bull's-eye.

631
01:06:26,091 --> 01:06:27,798
他在这里干嘛?
What's he doing here?

632
01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:48,976
- 挺住!  - 坚持住 别闭眼睛
- Come on!  - Come on. Just stay with us.

633
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:50,482
把他衣服脱下来
Pull back his jacket.

634
01:06:55,117 --> 01:06:57,954
呼吸 快呼吸 好吗?
Breathe. Breathe, all right?

635
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:04,706
没事了 没事了
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

636
01:07:04,794 --> 01:07:05,958
一千
A thousand.

637
01:07:06,046 --> 01:07:07,421
坚持住!
Come on!

638
01:07:09,173 --> 01:07:11,213
- 不要!  - 不! 别闭眼睛
- Come on!  - No! No! Stay with us.

639
01:07:11,301 --> 01:07:12,415
- 别这样  - 睁开眼睛!
- Come on.  - Open your eyes!

640
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,838
别这样!
Come on!

641
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:15,967
不要这样!
Come on!

642
01:07:17,223 --> 01:07:18,633
不要这样!
Come on!

643
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,523
这是他用过的第一颗能追查的子弹
This bullet is the first traceable bullet he's ever used.

644
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:17,232
是这个人生产的 他叫佩克瓦斯基
It was made by this man. His name is Pekwarsky.

645
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:20,822
他现在在东摩拉维亚的一个修道院
He works out of what is now a monastery in Eastern Moravia.

646
01:08:20,909 --> 01:08:23,827
这里就是兄弟会的诞生地
This place is where the Fraternity was born.

647
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:30,833
他在嘲笑我
He's taunting me.

648
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,960
他给我发了一个讯息
He's sending me a message.

649
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:34,541
我也要回敬他一个
I'm gonna send him one back.

650
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:36,541
他在引诱你
He's trapping you.

651
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:39,006
让你去一个他很熟悉的地方
Leading you to a place he knows very well.

652
01:08:39,094 --> 01:08:40,968
我知道 我...
Look, I know this. I...

653
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:45,671
你们训练我就是为了这个
This is what you trained me for.

654
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,143
你不能独自去
You can't go alone.

655
01:08:47,227 --> 01:08:50,346
只有我一个人去他才会出现 他又不傻
I go alone or he doesn't show. He's not stupid.

656
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:55,392
听着杀掉兄弟会成员的人是我
Look, a member of the Fraternity is dead because of me.

657
01:09:00,907 --> 01:09:02,023
好吧
Okay.

658
01:09:04,369 --> 01:09:05,483
你去吧
Go.

659
01:09:09,374 --> 01:09:10,784
谢谢
Thank you.

660
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:21,205
我觉得不应该这样
I don't think that's a good idea.

661
01:09:30,978 --> 01:09:32,805
你的下一个任务
Your next assignment.

662
01:10:32,413 --> 01:10:33,742
佩克瓦斯基吗?
Pekwarsky?

663
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:50,043
该死
Shit.

664
01:10:58,022 --> 01:11:00,014
你为什么来这里?
What are you doing here?

665
01:11:01,274 --> 01:11:02,934
放下枪
Lower your gun.

666
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:15,285
你认得这个吧?
You recognise this?

667
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:17,318
从我肩膀里取出来的
I pulled this out of my shoulder.

668
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,946
用它射击的那个人杀了我爸爸
The guy who put it there killed my father.

669
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,248
我知道是你生产的 告诉我他在哪
Now, I know you made it, so tell me where he is.

670
01:11:22,336 --> 01:11:26,285
子弹是我设计的 但谁用他我可就不负责了
I did mould this, but I can't be responsible for the people who use them.

671
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:29,383
别废话 告诉我他在哪
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.

672
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:31,128
看看我手指放在哪
Look at my finger.

673
01:11:32,846 --> 01:11:35,847
我可以安排你们见面
I can try and arrange a meet.

674
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:02,165
你想过改行吗?
Have you ever thought about doing things differently?

675
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,875
什么意思?
How do you mean?

676
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,502
我也说不清
I don't know.

677
01:12:06,504 --> 01:12:08,662
像别人一样
Being somebody else.

678
01:12:09,674 --> 01:12:11,666
做个普通人
Somebody normal.

679
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:19,887
没想过
No.

680
01:12:25,856 --> 01:12:27,018
该死
Shit.

681
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:30,437
让开!
Out of the way!

682
01:13:00,766 --> 01:13:01,964
别过来
Stay.

683
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:23,900
嘿!
Hey!

684
01:13:26,206 --> 01:13:27,997
他在火车上
He's on the train.

685
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:29,829
只有他
He's alone.

686
01:13:30,253 --> 01:13:31,663
谢谢
Thank you.

687
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:56,645
不好意思 坐下!
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!

688
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:59,226
先生 坐下! 我不会伤害你们的
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.

689
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:02,408
先生 坐下... 坐下!
Sir, sit... sit down! Sir, sit down!

690
01:14:14,461 --> 01:14:17,332
让开! 坐下! 坐下!
Get out of the way! Sit down! Stay down! Stay down!

691
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:19,249
坐着别动! 坐下!
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!

692
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:31,049
韦斯利
Wesley.

693
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:42,025
让开! 都让开!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

694
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:55,092
不 不!
No, no, no!

695
01:18:30,877 --> 01:18:33,583
韦斯利 听我说
Wesley, listen to me.

696
01:18:33,673 --> 01:18:35,629
闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up!

697
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:37,874
你别跟我说话
You don't get to talk to me.

698
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,510
你不配跟我说话
You don't get to talk to me.

699
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:42,381
他们在骗你
Everything they told you was a lie.

700
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:46,598
闭嘴 你这个混蛋 闭上狗嘴
Shut up, you lying piece of shit. You shut the fuck up.

701
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,185
我是你父亲
You are my son.

702
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:55,893
你说什么?
What did you say?

703
01:18:56,485 --> 01:18:58,525
你刚才说什么?
What did you say to me?

704
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:31,804
他说的是真的吗?
Is it true?

705
01:19:34,482 --> 01:19:35,644
是的
Yes.

706
01:19:39,987 --> 01:19:41,481
你们为什么要这么做?
Why did you make me do this?

707
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:44,775
因为你是唯一让他下不了手的人
Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.

708
01:19:49,746 --> 01:19:51,537
你早就知道 该死的
You knew, God damn it.

709
01:19:51,873 --> 01:19:53,912
你一直都知道
You knew the entire time.

710
01:19:55,043 --> 01:19:56,951
他的名字出现了
Well, his name came up.

711
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,587
你的也一样
So did yours.

712
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,959
好的 没关系的
No, it was okay. Never mind.

713
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:53,009
不 不 不是那样的
No. No, it was complete shit.

714
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,944
我答应你爸爸 把你带回这里
I promised your father I'd bring you back here.

715
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,580
搞什么?
What the fuck?

716
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:21,785
他说只有这样才能让你相信
He said it was the only way you'd believe.

717
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:32,461
你爸爸总是带着这些照片
Your father was never more than a camera click away.

718
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:50,899
这是我
That's me.

719
01:21:55,117 --> 01:21:56,861
他是我爸爸
He was my father.

720
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:00,871
但我杀了他
And I killed him.

721
01:22:00,956 --> 01:22:05,202
对他而言 保护你比他自己的命都重要
To your father, protecting you was worth giving up his life.

722
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:07,873
保护我?
Protect me?

723
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:11,045
他想杀了我!
He was trying to fucking kill me!

724
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:14,798
不 他不是想杀你
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.

725
01:22:15,554 --> 01:22:17,712
他是想救你
He was trying to rescue you.

726
01:22:23,687 --> 01:22:26,178
克洛斯离开兄弟会的时候
When Cross left the Fraternity,

727
01:22:26,273 --> 01:22:28,229
斯隆就一直在找你
Sloan hunted you down.

728
01:22:30,067 --> 01:22:34,943
自从福克斯找上你 他就想把你们分开
Ever since Fox had her teeth in you, he's been trying to separate you from them.

729
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:41,242
你父亲不希望你加入兄弟会 韦斯利
Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley.

730
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:45,082
他希望你过不一样的生活
He wanted a different path for you,

731
01:22:50,379 --> 01:22:53,084
不要重蹈他的覆辙
with things that he could never have.

732
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:55,127
能有个家
A home.

733
01:22:56,093 --> 01:22:57,753
- 过着平静的生活  - 不
- Peace.  - No.

734
01:22:58,387 --> 01:23:01,341
他希望你有自己的人生
He hoped you would find your own way.

735
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:10,263
这个是你父亲留下的
Your father got hold of this.

736
01:23:12,235 --> 01:23:14,227
你来破译吧
Decipher it yourself.

737
01:23:21,452 --> 01:23:25,947
多年前 斯隆就为牟私利 开始捏造目标
Sloan began manufacturing targets of his own for profit years ago.

738
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:30,282
被你父亲发现了
Your father found out about it.

739
01:23:30,793 --> 01:23:33,153
所以他想做点什么 是吧?
And he was going to do something about it on his own, right?

740
01:23:33,212 --> 01:23:36,047
但斯隆让所有人都与他为敌
But Sloan turned everyone against him.

741
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:38,588
我父亲的名字没有出现 是吧?
My father's name never even came up, did it?

742
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:41,720
是的 坚守原则让他成为众矢之的
No. Holding to the code made him a target.

743
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:47,465
好了
Yes.

744
01:24:01,907 --> 01:24:04,279
- 你让我逃跑?  - 不
- You want me to run?  - No.

745
01:24:04,951 --> 01:24:06,742
我希望你活下去
I want you to live.

746
01:24:08,122 --> 01:24:10,873
你应该过截然不同的人生 韦斯利
You can have a different life, Wesley.

747
01:24:11,792 --> 01:24:14,330
这是你父亲希望的
Like your father wanted for you.

748
01:25:41,129 --> 01:25:42,955
他被我们教得很好
We trained him well.

749
01:26:26,839 --> 01:26:29,128
有一点我父亲说错了
My father was wrong about one thing.

750
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,921
他们说的不都是谎话
Everything they told me wasn't a lie.

751
01:26:32,011 --> 01:26:35,297
他们教会我如何杀人 如何麻木
They taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain,

752
01:26:35,389 --> 01:26:39,340
更重要的是 工欲善其事 必先利其器
and most importantly, that every job has a perfect weapon.

753
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:45,471
我就是那致命的武器
Well, I'm the perfect weapon.

754
01:26:47,526 --> 01:26:49,603
我应该逃跑?
And I'm supposed to run?

755
01:26:49,696 --> 01:26:52,268
不 我这一辈子都在逃跑
No, I've been doing that my entire life.

756
01:26:52,823 --> 01:26:54,199
所以这次不了
So I say no.

757
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:58,741
我要杀光他们 其它的就听天由命
I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess.

758
01:27:53,632 --> 01:27:54,913
杀了他
Kill him.

759
01:28:48,018 --> 01:28:49,393
他在这!
He's here!

760
01:31:59,454 --> 01:32:00,734
胆小鬼
Pussy.

761
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:03,825
胆小鬼 胆小鬼
Pussy, pussy.

762
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:19,723
胆小鬼 胆小鬼
Pussy, pussy.

763
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:26,051
胆小鬼
Pussy.

764
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,749
斯隆!
Sloan!

765
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:54,014
我父亲不是叛徒
My father wasn't a traitor.

766
01:33:57,444 --> 01:33:59,271
这是杀人指令
This is a kill order.

767
01:34:01,948 --> 01:34:04,274
上面写着斯隆
And it's got Sloan's name on it.

768
01:34:07,703 --> 01:34:09,696
你跟我是怎么说的?
What did you say to me?

769
01:34:10,373 --> 01:34:12,614
这是个名字 一个目标
It's a name. It's a target.

770
01:34:15,712 --> 01:34:18,037
不是我要他死
I don't want this person dead.

771
01:34:18,924 --> 01:34:20,418
但命运如此
Fate does.

772
01:34:23,929 --> 01:34:26,051
命运要你死
Fate wanted you dead.

773
01:34:28,098 --> 01:34:29,759
他无法改变
And he couldn't take it.

774
01:34:29,851 --> 01:34:33,894
所以他为了谋求私利 开始捏造目标
So he started manufacturing his own targets for his own gains.

775
01:34:34,563 --> 01:34:38,726
但我父亲发现了他的阴谋 想要阻止他
And that's when my dad found out and decided to stand against him.

776
01:34:39,777 --> 01:34:43,524
所以你就派我...
And that's when you sent a man's son...

777
01:34:43,613 --> 01:34:45,523
去杀我的父亲
to kill his father.

778
01:34:48,577 --> 01:34:51,412
你不是命运杀手 斯隆
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.

779
01:34:53,248 --> 01:34:56,000
你只是一个滥用子弹的暴徒
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.

780
01:35:12,558 --> 01:35:14,100
他说的是真的吗?
Is that true?

781
01:35:21,067 --> 01:35:23,190
真相是这样的
Here is what the truth is.

782
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:28,817
你的名字出现了
Your name came up.

783
01:35:40,044 --> 01:35:41,751
你的名字出现了
Your name came up.

784
01:35:57,018 --> 01:35:58,761
你的名字出现了
Your name came up.

785
01:36:00,772 --> 01:36:02,100
还有你的名字
Your name.

786
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:05,102
你的名字
Your name.

787
01:36:05,777 --> 01:36:07,105
你的
Yours.

788
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:10,568
这里每个人的名字都出现了
Everyone in this room.

789
01:36:16,121 --> 01:36:18,611
如果我不那么做
If I had not done what I did,

790
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:22,951
你们早都死了
you would all be dead.

791
01:36:25,588 --> 01:36:27,580
我救了你们
I saved your lives.

792
01:36:29,258 --> 01:36:33,207
看看现在的我们 多么强大
Now look where we are. We are stronger than ever.

793
01:36:34,429 --> 01:36:37,430
改写了历史
Changing the course of history as we see it.

794
01:36:39,434 --> 01:36:41,806
选择了目标
Choosing the targets we select.

795
01:36:43,813 --> 01:36:47,728
我们能够重构权力结构
We can redistribute power where we see fit.

796
01:36:50,278 --> 01:36:51,856
强者生存
The wolves rule.

797
01:36:53,782 --> 01:36:55,324
弱者灭亡
Not the sheep.

798
01:36:57,369 --> 01:37:00,703
如果你们想逐字逐句...
Now, if any of you feel the need to follow the code...

799
01:37:00,789 --> 01:37:03,244
遵守兄弟会的规矩
of the Fraternity to the letter,

800
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:07,824
那就把枪放进嘴里
I invite you to take your gun,

801
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,791
然后扣动扳机
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.

802
01:37:14,885 --> 01:37:17,093
韦斯利就想让你们这样
That is what Wesley demands.

803
01:37:18,765 --> 01:37:20,140
或者
Otherwise,

804
01:37:20,766 --> 01:37:22,640
可以杀掉这个混蛋...
shoot this motherfucker...

805
01:37:22,727 --> 01:37:26,013
让杀手兄弟会高一个层次...
and let us take our Fraternity of Assassins to heights...

806
01:37:26,105 --> 01:37:28,726
成为人类的神
reserved only for the gods of men.

807
01:37:32,611 --> 01:37:34,022
你们自己选吧
You choose.

808
01:37:49,086 --> 01:37:50,663
规矩去死吧
Fuck the code.

809
01:38:54,441 --> 01:38:56,267
斯隆!
Sloan!

810
01:39:21,467 --> 01:39:23,958
斯隆!
Sloan!

811
01:39:40,443 --> 01:39:44,144
六周以前 我是个普通人
Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.

812
01:39:46,282 --> 01:39:47,908
就像你一样
Just like you.

813
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:52,781
但现在的我呢?
But who am I now?

814
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:56,916
是客户经理?
Account manager?

815
01:39:59,296 --> 01:40:00,624
杀手?
Assassin?

816
01:40:02,631 --> 01:40:06,843
还是一个脑残地杀死自己父亲的人?
Or just another tool who was mind-fucked into killing his father?

817
01:40:08,846 --> 01:40:10,506
那都是我
I am all of these.

818
01:40:11,765 --> 01:40:13,474
也都不是我
And I am none of these.

819
01:40:16,228 --> 01:40:17,805
我到底是谁?
Who am I now?

820
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:51,882
这不是我的命运
This is not me fulfilling my destiny.

821
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:00,061
也不是追随我父亲的脚步
This is not me following in my father's footsteps.

822
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:02,882
搜索韦斯利・吉布森 无结果

823
01:41:04,567 --> 01:41:07,520
更不是我拯救了世界
This is definitely not me saving the world.

824
01:41:26,172 --> 01:41:28,924
还在想你是谁?
Still trying to figure out who you are?

825
01:41:30,092 --> 01:41:32,168
那不是我
This is not me.

826
01:41:35,055 --> 01:41:37,592
