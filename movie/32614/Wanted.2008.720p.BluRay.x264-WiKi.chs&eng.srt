2
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,290
一千年前…

3
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,540
一群织布工组织了一个秘密的刺客集团

4
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,710
他们通过暗杀活动  使濒临崩溃的世界恢复秩序

5
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,970
他们自称为"兄弟会"

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,310
六个星期前…

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,760
韦斯利·吉布森  没有结果

157
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,150
无法处理您的交易

158
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,360
无法处理您的交易

159
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,450
资金不足  你是个混蛋

160
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,660
你没钱了  你最好的朋友在操你女朋友

161
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,870
你知道  可是你这软蛋什么也做不了 
正确---- 错误---

332
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,480
黑帮在屋顶火拚 五人被乱枪打死

363
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,790
去你妈的

366
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,930
摄像头摄下嫌犯面容

367
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,440
通缉犯

378
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,640
17号织造厂

7
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,850
生日快乐  亲爱的贾妮丝
Happy birthday, dear Janice

8
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,520
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you!

9
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,650
正在过生日的是我那得了厌食症的老板
It's my anorexic boss' birthday.

11
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,370
这意味着各个办公室的人  都在某种程度的压力下
This means there's a certain amount of inter-office pressure

12
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,530
被迫站到会议桌边
to stand around the conference table

13
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,000
一边吃着垃圾食品  一边假装崇拜她
eating crappy food and pretending to worship her.

14
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,040
真好吃
That's so good.

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,460
要在整整五分钟里  忘记贾妮丝对大家的残酷压迫
WESLEY: Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable

16
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,260
这是我一天里最困难的工作
is the hardest work I'll do all day.

17
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,890
我的工作头衔是账户经理
My job title is account manager.

18
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,060
以前我的工作是叫做账户服务代表
I used to be called an account service representative,

19
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,560
可是有个顾问说  我们需要的是管理客户
but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients

20
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,520
而不是给他们服务
and not service them.

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,570
我有个女朋友  我对她既没有管理也没有服务
I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service.

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,280
我最要好的朋友巴里  正在一张宜家牌餐桌上操她
That's my best friend, Barry, fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table

25
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,000
那张桌子是我用很实惠的价钱淘来的
I picked up for a really good price.

26
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,460
我发现最近我很难在乎什么事了
I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days.

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,800
事实上  我唯一在乎的事就是  我对任何事情都关心不起来
In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything.

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,590
真的  这让我很担心
Seriously. It worries me.

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,640
我叫韦斯利·吉布森
My name is Wesley Gibson.

31
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,270
我出生才七天  爸爸就扔下妈妈跑了
My dad walked out on my mom when I was seven days old.

32
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,110
有时我想  也许他曾经望着宝贝儿子的蓝眼睛  扪心自问
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,

33
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,940
我就是这个21世纪头号废柴的老爸吗
"Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century?"

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,820
好  要是你能在28号以前把托卖的  货物给我  对
Well, if you could get me the consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah.

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,360
你面前有号码吗
Do you have the numbers in front of you?

36
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,620
别紧张
MR x: Relax.

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,830
如果出现的是你的名字  你早就死了
If your name had come up, you'd be dead already.

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
我们最近有一些意外的损失
We've had some unexpected losses recently.

39
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,010
我们想知道
We'd like to know

40
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,010
我们的对头是从哪里搞到军火的
where our competitor is getting his munition.

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,520
很干净
It's clean.

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,190
什么意思
Meaning?

43
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,730
意思就是没法追查来源
Meaning it's untraceable.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,440
你的对头非常聪明
Your competitor's very smart.

46
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,990
卧倒
Get down!

49
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,880
我操
Fuck it.

56
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,040
没有人能脱离兄弟会  "十字架"
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.

57
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,590
我对兄弟会有了新的看法
I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.

58
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,130
小心点
MR x: Careful.

59
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,140
你不可能毁掉存在了一千年的组织
You don't destroy something that's been around for a thousand years.

60
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,180
组织已经毁了  他破坏了法典
It's already destroyed. He broke the code.

61
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,430
我不能不阻止
I have to stop this.

62
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,480
真的  你明白
Really? You know this.

63
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,100
那为什么你不肯亲自来面对我
So why don't you face me yourself?

64
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,320
千万别派小绵羊来杀大灰狼
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

65
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,990
他们只是幌子
CROSS: They were just the decoys.

66
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,320
再见  X先生
Goodbye, Mr x.

71
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,440
千万别派小绵羊来杀大灰狼
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

72
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,690
他们只是幌子
They were just the decoys.

73
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,360
韦斯利
Wesley!

74
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,570
怎么啦
What is it?

75
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,530
什么怎么啦  听啊
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.

77
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,910
这么吵  你叫我怎么睡得着
Well, how am I suppose to sleep with all that fucking racket?

78
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,420
老是被这鬼东西吵醒  我们到底什么时候搬家
When are we gonna move so we don't have to wake up to that shit?

79
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,210
我倒是有点喜欢这声音
I kind of like it.

80
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,170
它可以淹没你那讨厌的破嗓门
WESLEY: It helps to drown out the sound of your annoying, fucking voice.

81
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,380
现在求求你  让我睡吧
Now, please, let me sleep.

82
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,890
你到底有没有考虑过我们谈的事
Have you even thought about our talk?

83
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,050
嗯
Yes.

84
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,810
哪一次
Which one?

85
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,350
好极了  好极了
Perfect. That's perfect.

86
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,770
给安娜贝尔喂食
Feed Annabelle.

91
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,270
对不起
Sorry.

92
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,610
哦  我的天哪
Oh, my fucking God.

93
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,490
但愿你桌上那个东西  不是我要的结算报告
I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk.

94
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,030
真像供桌上的一泡大便
Holy shit on an altar, it is.

95
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,830
一小时内把报告交到我桌上
I want that report on my desk in one hour.

96
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,450
好吧  各位  我们还要加班一小时…
Okay, everybody, we're all gonna stay an extra hour...

97
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
想听点惨事吗
Want to hear something sad?

98
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,290
我必须使用人体工程学键盘才能让  重复性压抑的危害不至于太大
I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.

99
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,920
我的重复性工作多得让我压抑  真他妈的惨
Just the fact that I repeat something enough that it causes me stress is fucking sad.

100
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,300
干得好  哥们  看见巴里没有
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?

101
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,180
他又去看牙医了
He had to go to the dentist. Again.

102
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,140
是啊
Yes!

104
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,640
巴里
Barry!

105
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,150
你说他们这里有没有事后避孕药
You think they have that morning-after pill here?

106
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,820
那东西很有用  碾碎了掺在荷包蛋里面
That thing works. Crush it up, put it in her omelette,

107
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,780
"嘿  宝贝  在床上吃早餐吧"  小心一点总没坏处
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed." You can never be too safe.

108
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,320
哦  老天
Oh, God.

109
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,620
我把钱包丢了
I lost my wallet somewhere.

110
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,450
这些都算在一起
All this together?

111
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,210
不  不  是的
No, no. Yes.

112
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,750
他是好汉
He is the man.

113
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,170
一共多少  哦  再加上这个
How much is it? Oh. Plus this.

114
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,550
20.42美元
$20.42.

115
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,090
西瓜味
Watermelon.

116
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,050
妞都喜欢
Chicks dig it.

117
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,100
谢谢
Thanks.

118
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,640
下回见
See you next time.

119
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,810
祝你晚上过得愉快
PHARMACIST: Have a good night.

120
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,430
我真喜欢这些能量饮料
I love these energy drinks, man.

121
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,480
我简直是在用能量饮料洗胃
I'm almost, like, kind of on an energy drink cleanse,

122
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,690
早饭时喝一罐  中饭时又要喝两三罐
where I do one for breakfast and then, like, two or three for lunch.

123
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,100
我是好汉
I'm the man?

124
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,430
对啊  巴里  我是好汉
Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.

125
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,930
事实上  我真是了不起的好汉
In fact, I'm so much the man,

126
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,730
要靠不停地吃药来防止焦虑症发作
I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks.

127
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,900
天哪  但愿有什么别的东西能缓解我的压力
God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress.

128
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,570
你好  韦斯利
Hello, Wesley.

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,360
你知道  有些人  是美人
You know, there are people, beautiful people,

130
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,200
你只希望她们能在别样的环境下  别样的地方看到你
you just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place,

131
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,740
不是在这个鬼地方看你  不是看你这副鬼样
instead of where you are, what you've become.

132
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,540
妮可长得太赞啦
Nicole is so hot.

133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,290
什么
What?

134
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,250
被她雷到啦
Boom goes the dynamite.

135
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,210
不过大多数时候  你希望自己不是那么废柴
WESLEY: But most of all, you wish you weren't such a pussy

136
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,420
不该企盼不可能发生的改变
for wishing for things that will never change.

137
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,100
全能的好上帝啊  你是在他妈的度春假吗
JANICE: Good God A'mighty, you're over here like it's spring fucking break,

138
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,470
我到现在还没拿到那份结算报告
and I still don't have that billing report.

139
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,140
我到底为什么养你  韦斯利
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?

140
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,560
我会做完的  贾妮丝
I'll get it done, Janice.

141
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,150
好像我以前没听过这话一样  "我会做完的"
Like I never heard that before. "I'll get it done."

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,480
我会做完的  我会做完的  我会做完的
"I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice.

144
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,320
我会做完的
"I'll get it done."

147
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,960
你就没什么要说的
Why don't you have anything to say for yourself?

148
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,960
对不起
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,130
哦  你这废物
Well, you're worthless.

150
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,220
我才应该说对不起  因为我雇了你这蠢驴
I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.

154
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,160
知道一天结束时最妙的一点是什么吗
You know what the best thing is about the end of the day?

155
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,200
明天又要从头再来一遍
Tomorrow it starts all over again.

163
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,060
嗨  你好吗  很好
Hi. How you doing? Good.

164
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,660
对不起  你道歉次数太多了
I'm sorry? You apologise too much.

165
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,370
我很抱歉
Sorry about that.

166
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,590
我认识你父亲
I knew your father.

167
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,060
我出生第一周  父亲就跑了  所以…
My father left the week I was born, so...

168
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,350
你父亲昨天在大都会大厦的屋顶上死了
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building.

169
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,770
对不起
Sorry.

171
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,780
你看  酒吧就在那边  所以…
Look, the liquor rounds are just over there, so...

172
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,490
你父亲是有史以来最优秀的刺客之一
Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived.

173
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,200
杀他的人就在你背后
The man who killed him is behind you.

176
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,590
别错过

177
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,550
最后的机会

179
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,390
那家伙乱开枪…
This guy's just shooting up...

180
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,770
对不起  对不起
Sorry. Sorry.

183
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,630
什么… 哦  上帝哦  上帝  刚才到底怎么回事
What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What the fuck just happened?

184
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,640
拜托  拜托  拜托  你开快点
Please! Please! Please drive faster.

185
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,600
拜托你安静  拜托  拜托开快点
Please be quiet. Please drive... Please drive faster.

186
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,140
请你  请你明白  我对自己的性命很在乎
Please... Please understand that I care about my life!

187
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,520
我不知道你干了什么事  把那家伙惹毛了
I don't know what the fuck you did to piss this guy off,

188
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,650
可是你得让我逃出去叫警察啊
but you're gonna have to let me out and call the cops!

189
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,820
嘿   嘿
Hey! Hey!

191
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,330
你干什么哦  操  你疯了吗
What are you doing? Oh, shit! Are you crazy?

192
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,620
哦  操
Oh, shit!

193
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,000
我看我们甩掉他了  我们甩掉他了
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.

194
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,260
在下一个街角让我下车  好吗
Could you let me out at the next corner, please?

195
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,970
操
Shit!

196
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,970
我操
Fuck!

197
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,140
哦  操
Oh, shit!

198
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,020
他就在那边
He's right there!

199
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,530
我是个会计  我只是个会计
Look, I'm an accountant. I'm just an accountant.

200
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,620
我操
Oh, fuck!

201
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,830
他还真是死心眼
He's fucking persistent, you know.

202
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,420
我操
Fuck!

204
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,720
给他点颜色瞧瞧
You kick his ass!

205
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,890
打他
Shoot him!

206
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,060
你干什么  你打自己的车干什么
What are you doing? What are you shooting our car for, huh?

207
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,570
你疯了吗  抓住方向盘
Are you crazy? Grab the wheel.

208
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,070
你要去哪
WESLEY: Where are you going?

209
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,410
回来
Get back in here!

210
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,540
哦  上帝
Oh, my God!

212
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,260
该死的对不起
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.

213
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,310
枪  什么
Gun! What?

214
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,650
在座位底下
Under the seat!

215
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,860
给
Here.

219
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,800
哦  操
Oh, shit!

221
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,300
操
Shit!

223
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,520
当心  让开
Look out! Get out!

224
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,860
当心哦  上帝
Look out! Oh, my God!

225
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,190
操
Shit!

226
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:44,030
对不起
I'm sorry!

230
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,250
在你后面
Behind you!

236
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,370
我操
Fuck.

237
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,330
操  操
Shit. Shit.

239
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,630
你好
Hello.

240
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,920
我没有钱  也没有…
I don't have any money or...

241
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,970
我还以为他的个子要
I thought he'd be

242
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,670
高一点
taller.

243
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,140
高一点
Taller?

244
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,720
先生…
Sir...

245
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,140
先生  我一直在对这位女士解释  我是个会计
Sir, I've been trying to explain to the lady here that I'm an accountant.

246
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,940
我是账户服务代表  我是账户经理
I'm an account service representative... I'm an account manager.

247
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,980
要是你们打电话给我的老板  贾妮丝
And I'm sure that if you call my boss, Janice,

248
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,940
她肯定会帮你们解决问题
she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.

249
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,280
你们可以给她发电子邮件或者  她会帮你们解决的
You can contact her by email or... She'll put you straight.

250
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,620
把苍蝇的翅膀打下来
Shoot the wings off the flies.

251
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,830
我不知道这是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

252
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,790
把苍蝇的翅膀打下来
Shoot the wings off the flies.

253
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,050
你们肯定是把我当成别人了
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else.

255
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,970
我数到三
On three.

256
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,760
你不开枪  我就开枪
Either you shoot, or I do.

257
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,270
一
One.

258
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,570
好吧
Okay.

260
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,280
二
Two.

261
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,410
我连看都看不清
I can't even see them!

263
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,210
三
Three.

265
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,270
好了  好了
Okay. Okay.

268
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,410
这不可能
That's impossible.

269
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,960
在今天以前  有很多事情对你来说是不可能的
SLOAN: A lot of things for you weren't possible before today.

270
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,960
韦斯利  你刚才体会到的  并不是恐慌症发作
What you experienced, Wesley, was not a panic attack.

271
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,420
你的心脏每分钟跳了400多下
Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute,

272
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,220
使你的血液里充满了肾上腺素
sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your bloodstream.

273
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,470
这就使你能比常人更快地观察和反应
This allows you to see and react faster than normal.

274
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,470
全世界能做到的人只有区区几个
Only a few people in the world can do that.

275
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,890
你父亲能做到  你也能做到
Your father could do it and you can do it.

276
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,400
稍微锻炼一下  你就能学会控制这样的发作
With a little work, you can learn to control these attacks.

277
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,270
离我远点
Stay away from me.

278
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,440
你离我远点
Just stay back from me.

279
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,820
我有枪  先生  明白吗
I have a gun, sir. All right?

280
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,450
我叫斯隆
My name is Sloan.

281
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,780
这位是狐狸
This is Fox.

282
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,540
在你周围的其他人都是杀人高手
And the others you see around you are all very good at killing.

283
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,960
所以呢  如果我是你  我会一直把枪指着我
So, if I were you, I'd keep the gun pointed at me.

284
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,080
用枪指着他们是没有好果子吃的
You don't wanna point it at any of them.

285
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,750
你这样比较好
That's better.

286
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,250
你是疯子  不
You're insane. No.

287
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,420
真正的疯狂是  明明体内流着杀手之血
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing

288
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,880
却碌碌无为地虚度光阴
when you have the blood of a killer flowing in your veins.

289
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,470
真正的疯狂是  心中关着一头猛狮
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,

290
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,010
手里掌握了释放它的钥匙
coasting through life in a miserable existence

291
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,180
却甘心被欺侮  被打败  浑浑噩噩地过着悲惨的人生
when you have a caged lion locked inside and a key to release it.

292
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,750
你手里的这把枪是伊玛尼什17型  它本来是你父亲的
This gun you're holding is an lmanishi 17. It belonged to your father.

293
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,750
他可以用它演奏交响乐
He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it.

294
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,840
你将用它杀死  残忍地枪杀你父亲的凶手
And you're going to use it to kill the man who shot him down in cold blood.

295
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,680
我不能  今天晚上想杀你的人也是他
I can't... The same man who tried to kill you tonight.

296
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,640
你父亲是我们的一员
Your father was one of us.

297
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,520
我们是刺客兄弟会  命运的武器
A fraternity of assassins. The weapons of fate.

298
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,020
我们已经把他的所有财产都转到你名下
We've transferred all of his assets over to you.

299
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,530
我向你保证   数目非常可观
And let me assure you, they are substantial.

300
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,200
这就是你等待了很久的命运
It is your long-awaited destiny

301
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,740
加入我们
to join us.

302
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,500
你退后  退后
Back off. Back off.

303
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,720
你对我一点也不了解
You don't know anything about me.

304
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,890
离我远点  离我远点
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

305
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,100
你离我远点
You stay away from me?

306
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,430
你离我远点  好吗  让我过去  行不行
You stay away from me, please? Will you let me through?

309
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,380
有时候做了一个梦  迷迷糊糊醒过来
You know when you have a dream and you're half awake,

310
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,510
那个梦仍然在脑海里  挥之不去
but it's still in the fringe of your brain?

311
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,390
这时候你睁开眼睛  发现那只是个梦  就会乐得打滚
Then you open your eyes and you're so damn glad it was a dream.

313
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,190
这一次可不是梦
This was nothing like that.

317
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,710
对不起  你等我一下好吗  谢谢
I'm sorry. Could you just give me one second? Thank you.

318
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,680
哦  操
Oh, shit.

320
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,360
韦斯利
Wesley.

321
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,320
你怎么了
What's up with you?

322
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,620
你什么意思
What do you mean?

323
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,000
你  你来得很早
You're... You're here early.

324
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,750
你  你看起来精神很好
Is... You seem a little pepped up.

325
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,340
你好吗  嗯  很好
You all right? Well, yeah.

326
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,420
很好
Yeah.

327
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,050
我觉得自己
I guess I feel

328
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,010
有点不一样了
kind of different.

329
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,180
随你怎么说吧  我要去拿点报事贴  要帮你拿一叠吗
Whatever. I'm gonna go get some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?

330
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,350
不用  真的
No. Really?

331
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,180
对  好吧
Yeah. Okay.

333
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,030
天哟  地哟  亲娘老子哟  我到现在还没拿到结算报告
Jesus H. Fucking Popsicle, I still don't have my billing reports,

334
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,030
你倒有闲工夫坐在这里上网
but you've got time to sit here and Google your ass off.

335
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,660
哦  我知道一件事
Well, I know one thing.

336
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,200
下星期就要评审你的表现
You've got your review coming up next week,

337
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,630
我是巴不得早一点扣你工资啊
and I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes.

338
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,710
工作态度  差  绩效  差
Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!

340
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,050
管理能力  差
Management skills, poor!

341
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,430
与他人的合作  那是天大的笑话
Works well with others. That's a fucking joke.

343
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,180
这是什么乱七八糟的   这家伙是谁
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?

344
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,220
有几个废柴在大楼上被人爆了头
Some loser gets his head blown off at the Metropolitan...

345
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,520
闭上你的臭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

346
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,990
她当了一个芝麻绿豆大的官
She has one single iota of tenuous power.

347
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,910
就以为可以把大家当佣人使唤
She thinks she can push everyone around.

348
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,160
你不需要这个
You don't need this.

349
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,910
我能理解
I understand.

350
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,750
国中的日子肯定不好过
Junior high must have been kind of tough,

351
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,460
可是这不等于说  你有权让员工做牛做马  贾妮丝
but it doesn't give you the right to treat your workers like horseshit, Janice.

352
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,920
我知道大家都在笑你  贾妮丝
I know we laugh at you, Janice.

353
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,930
我们都知道你在办公桌最上面的抽屉里  藏了很多果酱甜甜圈
We all know you keep your stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk.

354
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,100
可是我要告诉你
But I want you to know

355
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,730
如果你不是那么招人厌  我们会同情你的
if you weren't such a bitch, we'd feel sorry for you.

356
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,130
我真的有点同情你
I do feel sorry for you.

357
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,970
可是考虑到你的表现
But as it stands, the way you behave,

358
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,770
我觉得我可以代表整个办公室的人
I feel I can speak for the entire office

359
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,230
对你说
when I tell you

360
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,060
吃屎去吧
go fuck yourself.

362
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,580
太强了  谁是好汉
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?

364
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,170
我是好汉
I'm the man.

369
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,210
这是个坏主意
That's a bad idea.

370
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,040
找不到你的钥匙了吗
Couldn't find your keys, huh?

371
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,880
这一手可能很有用  你会教我吗
That could be handy. You going to teach me that?

372
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,670
我也许用得着
I might need that.

373
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,930
你叫  狐狸  对吧  那是什么  是代号吗
So, Fox, right? What is that? Is that a call sign?

374
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,720
就像《壮志凌云》里的"小牛"
Is it like Maverick in Top Gun?

375
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,850
你要是告诉我真名  就得杀了我
You could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?

376
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,730
我开玩笑的
I'm just kidding.

380
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,790
彼得
Peter!

381
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,920
检查一下这台STB的梭子转速  应该是每分钟300转
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB. It should be 300 per minute.

382
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,550
这种棉织品的相反丝线应该是4000根
This kind of cotton weave, the opposing thread count should be 4,000.

383
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,050
嘿   真了不起
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?

384
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,010
这是幌子吗
Is it a front?

385
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,600
什么东西的幌子  我不知道
Front for what? I don't know.

386
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,230
暗杀吧
Assassinations.

387
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,480
你也许以为这是用来掩盖的幌子
You may think this is a front for something,

388
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,320
我只能告诉你这是一个纺织厂
all I can tell you is this is a textile mill.

389
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,320
乔治… 乔治  去帮彼得一下
And George... George, go help Peter up there.

390
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,530
好
Yeah.

391
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,870
这是个纺织厂
This is a textile mill.

392
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,450
而且很不错
And a damn good one.

393
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,330
哦  妙极了  不过那是骗人的吧
WESLEY: Yeah, that's cute, but that's bullshit, right?

394
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,670
我是说  这些人都是杀手吧  对吗
I mean, all these guys are killers, aren't they?

395
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,130
我觉得你该回答我几个问题
I think you owe me some answers.

396
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,300
好吧  我显然是不懂
All right. Clearly I don't understand,

397
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,220
你们是做毛衣的还是杀人的
but do you make sweaters or do you kill people?

399
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,860
喝杯咖啡问了这么多问题
That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.

400
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,080
你真的准备好听答案了吗
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?

401
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,830
是的
Yes, I'm sure.

402
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,590
我没法回头了
I can't go back.

403
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,340
不可能回到原来的生活
Not to my life.

404
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,470
他归你了
He's all yours.

405
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,220
好  咱们走
All right. We're up.

406
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,610
你好吗
How you doing?

407
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,320
我是修补匠
I'm The Repairman.

408
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,150
你修补什么
What do you repair?

409
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,570
一辈子的坏习惯
A lifetime of bad habits.

410
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,100
好吧  你帮我个忙好吗
Okay. Would you do me a favour?

411
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,770
把你的手臂放到身后
Just put your arms behind your back.

412
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,270
没事的  我不知道
It's okay. I don't know...

413
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,020
放到背后  这样就行
Just behind your back. Is this okay?

414
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,440
放松
Just relax.

415
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,270
这也是训练
Is this part of it?

416
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,900
我们开始吧
REPAIRMAN: There we go.

417
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,650
你要在我头上套个口袋  不  不用口袋
You going to put a bag over my head? No. There's no need for a bag.

418
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,950
不会太紧吧  不  这样很好
That's not too tight, is it? No, that's nice.

419
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,750
你为什么来这里  韦斯利
Why did you come here, Wesley?

420
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,630
是你带我来的  你忘了
Well, you brought me here, remember?

421
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,010
你他妈的干什么
What the fuck did you do that...

424
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,560
修理工打了他几下
How many punches did The Repairman throw

425
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,980
才开始数绵羊的
before he was counting sheep?

426
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,650
以前我的脸被打的次数不多  明白吗
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having my face smashed in before, all right?

427
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,280
你用刀的次数多吗  早饭  中饭和晚饭时都用
Did you spend a lot of time with knives? At breakfast, lunch and dinner.

428
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,830
操
Fuck.

429
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,130
刚才那是个反问句   蠢驴
It was a rhetorical question, culo.

430
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,500
你要是再插嘴   我就用刀刃抽你
You interrupt me again, I use the business end.

431
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,380
他妈的  现在你听好了
Here's what you need to know, puto.

432
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,670
刀子很容易隐藏
Knives are easy to hide.

433
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,350
它们不会卡壳  也永远不会用光子弹
They don't jam and they never run out of bullets.

435
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,020
如果你要做近距离接触的工作
They come in handy

436
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,730
刀子是非常好用的
when you have to do some close contact work.

437
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,600
这是怎么回事  老兄
What the fuck, man?

438
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,570
过来  过来  啥
Come here. Come here. What?

439
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,370
现在  试着砍我  什么
Now, try to cut me. What?

440
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,990
试着砍我  喂
Try to cut me. Hey!

441
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,460
就用那个戳我  你当心点  这刀很快
Just stick me with that... Be careful with that. That's sharp.

442
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,540
你就戳  戳  戳   为什么
Just stick and stick and stick. Why?

443
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,210
说真的  老兄  我可能会弄伤你  喂
Seriously, man, I could hurt you. Hey!

444
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,210
好吧  娘娘腔
Okay, pussy.

445
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,130
我不是娘娘腔  你就是娘娘腔
I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy.

446
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,840
不   我不是娘娘腔  你就是娘娘腔
No, I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy!

447
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,930
我不是娘娘腔  我只是在意你的健康状况
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect for the human condition.

448
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,720
放屁  娘娘腔  我不是娘娘腔
Fuck that, you pussy! I'm not a pussy!

449
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,970
你就是娘娘腔  我不是娘娘腔
You're a pussy! I'm not a pussy!

450
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,520
来吧  娘娘腔   我不是娘娘腔
Come on, pussy. I'm not a pussy!

454
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,580
嗨   你好吗
Hi. How you doing?

455
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,830
怎么回事
What the fuck?

456
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,540
操
The fuck!

457
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,920
稍等一下   稍等一下
Just a moment. Just a moment.

458
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,590
对不起
Sorry.

459
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,550
喂   喂
WESLEY: Hello? Hey!

460
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,720
回来  喂
Hey, come back! Hey!

461
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,510
你一定要喝下去  喝下去  对
You must drink. Drink. Yeah.

463
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,600
这是什么  这里是康复室
What is this? This is the recovery room.

464
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,730
这种药浴可以刺激白血球  加快康复
This bath stimulates white blood cells and speed up the process.

465
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,320
在这里  瘀伤  刀伤  骨折只要几个小时就能好  不用等上几天
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days.

466
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,450
你骗我吧
You shitting me?

467
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,240
这是什么  伏特加  对
What is that? Vodka? Yeah.

468
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,240
你是俄罗斯人   对
Are you Russian? Yeah.

469
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,620
起来
Get up.

470
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,870
这是枪匠
This is The Gunsmith.

471
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,960
他对枪械的了解比任何人都多  他会教你怎么用枪
He knows more about a piece than anybody, and he's gonna teach you how to use one.

472
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,340
你好吗  很好
How you doing? Pretty good.

473
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:47,340
你知道吗塞尔查的腿断了  哦  真的
You know that Seltzer broke his leg? Oh, really?

474
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,350
真的  断了三处
Yeah, in three places.

475
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,310
怎么会的  从大楼上跳下来摔的
How'd he do that? Jumped off a building.

476
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,690
那他还好吧  还行  不过伤势挺重的
FOx: So, is he okay? GUNSMITH: Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.

477
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,360
哦  上帝
Oh, my God.

478
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,030
哦  上帝  这做得太像真的了
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.

479
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,110
他已经在康复室呆了三天
He's been in recovery for, like, three days now,

480
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,320
他们说还不能让他出来
and they say they're not even gonna let him out.

481
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,500
哦  上帝
Oh, my God.

482
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,250
哦  上帝
Oh, my God.

483
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,000
哦  上帝
Oh, my God!

484
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,510
喂  我们不能开枪打死掉的女人  也许她是什么人的妈妈…
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman! She might be somebody's mom...

486
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,350
你必须了解子弹打在人身上是什么样的
You need to know what it's like to put a bullet in a body.

487
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,600
你为什么来这儿
Why are you here?

488
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,650
你知道  我以为我是来学习  当超级刺客的
You know, I thought I was learning to be some kind of super assassin.

489
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,270
如果我想挨揍
You know, if I wanted to get beat up,

490
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,360
我就会呆在自己的小办公室隔间里了
I would have stayed in my cubicle, you know.

491
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,820
操
Fuck.

492
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,200
好  射靶子
FOx: All right, shoot the target.

493
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,450
从那里射
From there.

494
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,870
你要我射穿死猪  我要你让子弹拐弯
You want me shoot through Wilbur? I want you to curve the bullet.

495
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,090
我怎么才能做到
How am I suppose to do that?

496
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,380
你要问的不是怎么做
It's not a question of how,

497
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,800
而是做什么
it's a question of what.

498
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,050
如果没有人告诉你子弹是走直线的
If no one told you that bullets flew straight

499
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,340
我给你一把抢  让你去射靶子
and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target,

500
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,180
你会做什么
what would you do?

501
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,560
让你的直觉来引导你
Let your instincts guide you.

502
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,950
他到底是怎么做到的
How the hell did he do that?

503
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,830
你能做到吗  你能做到吗  喂
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?

504
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,960
嘿  我觉得那火车是我的老相识
Hey, I think that's my old train.

505
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,420
现在也是
Still is.

507
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,300
操你混蛋
Shit! You fucking asshole!

508
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,760
来吧
Come on!

509
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,520
咱们走
Let's go.

510
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,020
你是不是疯了
Are you out of your fucking mind?

511
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,570
哦  操  哦  操  哦  操  哦  操
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

513
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,220
哦  上帝  我觉得  我觉得  我觉得
Oh, God, I feel... I feel... I feel...

514
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,510
我觉得有点爽
I feel kind of good.

515
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,650
他干掉了裂嘴  完美的一枪  不可思议的角度
He got Rictus. Perfect shot. Impossible angle.

516
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:20,280
十字架正在一个一个地杀我们
Cross is taking us out one by one.

517
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,450
韦斯利是唯一能做掉他的人
And Wesley is the only one who can get to him.

518
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,620
每过一个小时   十字架都会走近一步
Cross gets closer with each hour.

519
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,790
回去工作
Get back to work.

520
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,460
看见那个吗
See that?

521
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,840
那是个梭子  对
It's a shuttle. Okay.

522
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,430
我要你想办法抓住它
I want you to try and catch it.

523
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,140
你要我把手伸进去
You want me to stick my hand in there?

524
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,350
对  我要你抓住它
Yes. I want you to catch it.

527
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,530
你要不要拿枪顶住我的头
You wanna put a gun to my head?

528
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,490
那样的话  我眼里的东西就会像苍蝇一样变慢
I can just slow things down like with the flies.

529
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,610
你必须学会自己控制这种能力
You need to learn to control that by yourself.

531
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,090
操  操  操
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

532
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,880
这是狗屎   我操
This is bullshit! Fuck this!

533
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,350
韦斯利  今天好吗
How's it going today, Wesley?

534
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,440
不好  我操织布机  我操修补匠
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!

535
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,360
我能打掉苍蝇的翅膀  我已经准备好了
I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly! I'm ready!

536
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,730
等到狐狸说你准备好了  你才算是准备好了
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.

537
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,280
谁让她负责的  我
Who put her in charge? I did.

539
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,580
韦斯利
Wesley.

541
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,290
别人都以为要抓这些小美人  得用奶酪
People think you use cheese to catch these beauties.

542
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,090
其实它们见到花生酱就会发疯
But they go apeshit for peanut butter.

543
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,800
你父亲特别爱玩这个  瞧
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch.

545
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,010
塑性炸药和花生酱
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!

546
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,390
对不起了  米奇
Sorry, Mickey.

547
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,140
五  四  三  二  一
Five, four, three, two, one.

548
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,150
嘿  嘿  俄国人
Hey. Hey, Russian.

549
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,280
这一只很不错
Good for one. Yeah.

550
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,490
要是有一千只会怎样  想想吧
Imagine if you had a thousand.

551
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,290
他们也狠狠地整过你  对吗
They really fucked you up, didn't they?

552
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,130
他们对你做过什么
What the hell did they do to you?

554
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,630
无缘无故把你扔到高速火车上
Throw you in front of a moving train for no reason?

555
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,800
打得你屁滚尿流
Beat the shit out of you?

556
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,970
你知道  你可以说出来的  这地方是狗屎  是狗屎  对吗
You know, you can say it, this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?

557
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,410
狗屎
Bullshit!

559
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,380
五分钟以后  修补匠
Repairman. Five minutes.

560
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,260
你就不能警告我一下
Heads up out of the question?

561
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,300
我操
Fuck.

562
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,810
你他妈的在浪费我的时间  你为什么来这儿
You're a waste of my fucking time! Why are you here?

563
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,890
我不知道  你打我吧
I don't know, so hit me.

564
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,860
你为什么来这儿  我活得猪狗不如  为什么不来这儿
Why are you here? I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I?

565
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,950
我要好好揍你一顿
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

566
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,780
告诉我吧  你要我说什么
Tell me what you want me to say.

567
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,370
你为什么来这儿  我不知道
Why are you here? I don't know!

568
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,080
你为什么来这儿
Why are you here?

569
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,790
你为什么来这儿   我不知道为什么来这儿
Why are you here? I don't know why I'm here.

570
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,590
你为什么来这儿
Why are you here?

571
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,840
你为什么来这儿
Why are you here?

572
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,970
我不知道我是谁
I don't know who I am.

573
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,230
你说什么  我说
What did you say? I said...

574
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,440
我说   我不知道我是谁
I said I don't know who I am.

575
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,740
你真的想知道你是谁
Do you really want to know who you are?

576
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,880
这是我的房间
Yeah. It's my room.

577
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,680
不
No.

578
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,600
这是你父亲的房间
This was your father's room.

579
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,320
出了什么事
WESLEY: What happened?

580
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,950
兄弟会的一个成员造反了
SLOAN: A member of this fraternity went rogue.

581
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,610
十字架
Cross.

582
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,000
他一开始就杀了一个比他优秀的人
He started by killing the one man who was better than him.

583
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,710
你父亲
Your father.

584
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,500
十字架在屋顶上偷袭他
Blindsided him on a rooftop.

585
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,840
背叛了他
Betrayed him.

586
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,130
这个房间里的一切
Everything in this room,

587
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,800
书  武器  衣服
books, weapons, clothes,

588
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,140
都是他的
belonged to him.

589
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,230
现在归你了
Now they belong to you.

590
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,150
在这个房间里试着了解他  韦斯利
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

591
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,690
也许只有靠这个方法  才能弄明白你是谁
It may be the only way of finding out who you are.

592
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,380
现在我知道了  为什么我以前对什么事都不在乎
Now I know why I could never care about anything before this.

593
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,130
我以前的生活是虚伪的
I was living a lie.

594
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,300
我终于有机会穿上父亲的鞋子
Finally, I have a chance to step into my father's shoes.

595
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:33,890
我成了男子汉  过上了我天生该过的生活
Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.

596
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,890
我之前还一直在逃避它  把它当成了又一份该死的结算报告
I've been pissing it all away like it was another fucking billing report.

597
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,650
我应该更努力地训练
I have to train harder.

598
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,320
我要和父亲一样优秀
I have to be as good as my father.

599
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,950
韦斯利  这些架子上放的  是兄弟会的刺杀记录
On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the Fraternity kills,

600
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,250
要杀你的目标  所有的信息都可以在这里找
everything you will need to kill your target.

601
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,870
要杀十字架
To kill Cross,

602
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,750
要杀那个背叛兄弟会  杀害我父亲的人  我必须做好准备
the man who betrayed the Fraternity and murdered my father, I must prepare.

603
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,170
我必须成为他的学生  记住他的每一次行动
I have to become his student, memorise every move he ever made,

604
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,680
他的每一次刺杀
every attack he ever executed.

605
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,850
他曾经在被特勤局特工包围的  密闭房间里杀掉了一个病人
When he dropped a patient in an airtight room surrounded by Secret Service agents.

606
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,730
他曾经在电梯里干掉了那个商人
When he took out that businessman in the elevator.

607
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,940
当然了  他的子弹是无迹可寻的
His bullets untraceable, of course.

608
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,030
不管他消灭目标时用的是什么武器  什么方法
Or how no matter what the weapon or how he eliminated his target,

609
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,290
他总是棋高一着
he was always one chess move ahead.

610
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,580
多留一手
One move more prepared.

611
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,750
先到一步
One step quicker.

612
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,790
先中一枪
One shot more precise.

613
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,920
事实上  我研究了那么多材料  发现他在杀人时从不失手
In fact, in all my research, I found that he never missed a target.

614
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,340
除了杀我那次
Not until me.

618
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:58,150
韦斯利  你这辈子第一次能控制了
First time in your life, Wesley, you're in control.

620
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,140
射靶子
Shoot the target.

621
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,530
你疯了
You're crazy.

625
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,620
欢迎加入兄弟会
Welcome to the Fraternity.

626
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,260
我们叫它天命织布机
We call this the Loom of Fate.

627
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:13,940
过了今天  你就再也不能走进这里
After today, you will never set foot in here again.

628
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,360
为什么
Why not?

629
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,820
因为你就和耶稣的门徒一样
Because, like an apostle,

630
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,570
你的任务不是阐释  而是传达
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.

631
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,240
历史上每一个文明都有一套密码
Every culture in history has a secret code,

632
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,410
那是在传统文字中找不到的
one you won't find in traditional texts.

633
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,790
一千年前
A thousand years ago,

634
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:39,210
一群织布工发现  织物中隐藏着一种神秘的语言
a clan of weavers discovered a mystical language hidden in the fabric.

635
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,090
他们自称为 "兄弟会"
They called themselves the Fraternity.

636
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,800
跟你说实话  我只看见一根根线
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.

637
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,300
过来
Come here.

638
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,810
看那儿
Look there.

639
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,020
你有没有看见  有一根线织得不合规律
Do you see that one thread that missed the weave

640
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,650
盖在了其他线上面
and lies on top of the others?

641
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,780
这是出错了  不  这是密码
Like a mistake? No, it's a code.

642
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,050
如果垂直线在上  那就是一
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.

643
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,510
如果在下  那就是零
If it's below, it's a zero.

644
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,140
二进制代码
Binary code?

645
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,140
内容是什么
What does it say?

646
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,390
是个名字
It's a name.

647
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,730
一个目标
A target.

648
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,190
那些名字是哪来的
Where do the names come from?

649
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,820
是因必要而产生的  韦斯利
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.

650
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,950
为了平卫这个世界的必要
A necessity to maintain balance in the world.

651
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,200
它们是必须被执行的命令
They are orders that must be executed,

652
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:40,080
我们被赋予在混乱中创造平静的使命
entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos.

653
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,630
这个是你的
This one is yours.

654
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,170
我不…
I don't...

655
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,760
听好  我以为你带我来这里杀十字架
Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.

656
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,140
你会杀的
You will.

657
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,600
等时间到的时候
In time.

658
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,350
这是你的第一项任务
This is your first assignment.

659
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,600
纺织机提供任务
The loom provides,

660
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,600
由我解读
I interpret,

661
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,900
由你执行
you deliver.

662
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,520
你要我去杀罗伯·迪恩·达登
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?

663
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,440
不是我
Not me.

664
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,110
是命运
Fate.

665
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,370
目标将会在会议室里 坐在主席座上
The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair.

666
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,380
总共有六个窗户
There are six windows.

667
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,380
你会从第五扇窗户射入
You will shoot through the fifth.

669
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,720
第五扇窗
Fifth window.

670
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,400
现在
Now.

674
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,840
他做了什么非死不可的事
What did he do that he deserves to die?

675
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,470
你不知道
You don't know.

676
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,140
我不知道他做了什么坏事  也不知道他有多邪恶
I don't know if he was bad, I don't know if he was evil.

677
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,100
我对他一无所知
I don't know anything about him.

678
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,600
我们从纺织机接收命令
We get our orders from a loom.

679
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,600
命运
Fate.

680
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,270
我们只能盲目地相信自己做的是对的
And we're supposed to take it on faith that what we're doing is right.

681
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,530
去杀我们根本不知道的人
Killing someone we know nothing about,

682
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,950
我不知道我能不能做到
I don't know if I can do that.

683
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,090
大约20年前
About 20 years ago,

684
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,510
有一个女孩
there was this girl.

685
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,590
她爸爸是联邦法官
Her dad was a federal judge,

686
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,390
所以她大概从小就认为  自己长大也会当法官
so she probably had it in her mind that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.

687
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,060
有一次她回家过圣诞节
So she's home one Christmas,

688
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,150
她爸爸正在办一件诈欺案
and her dad's on this big racketeering case.

689
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,490
被告想要换个较心软的法官
The defendants want to get a softer judge.

690
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,950
可以被他们收买的法官
One they can buy off.

691
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,030
所以他们雇用了一个人
So they hire this guy,

692
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,120
这个人叫做麦克斯·佩特里吉
Max Petridge,

693
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,160
让他去拜访她爸爸
get him to pay her father a visit.

694
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,920
而他拜访人的方法
And the way he pays people a visit

695
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,880
就是闯入对方家里
is to break in

697
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,220
绑起他的家人
And tie up their loved ones,

698
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,590
然后强迫他们看
and force them to watch

699
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,310
他活活烧死他的目标
while he burns his targets alive.

700
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,980
然后他会拿铁丝制衣架  把它卷起来
And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it round

701
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:19,820
把他名字的简写烙印在他们身上  让他们永生难忘
and brands his initials into each one of them so they will never ever forget.

702
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,540
我被吸收进兄弟会后
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,

703
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,960
在那联邦法官被杀之前几个礼拜
I found out that Max Petridge's name had come up

704
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:34,290
麦克斯·佩特里吉的名字就出现过
weeks before the federal judge was killed,

705
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,170
但当时的兄弟会成员却下不了手杀他
and that a Fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger.

706
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,680
我不知道我们做的决定对未来的影响有多深远
We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go.

707
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,230
也许你杀一个人
You kill one, and maybe,

708
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,650
可以救一千人
save a thousand.

709
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:57,570
那就是兄弟会的法规
That's the code of the Fraternity.

710
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,240
那正是我们所相信的  所以我们才做这些事
That's what we believe in, and that's why we do it.

711
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,530
现在
Now!

712
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,570
十字架
Cross.

713
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,940
还没
Not yet.

714
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,950
你的目标将会在一台黑色豪华轿车里
Your target will be in a black limo.

715
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,740
他的车会在哈士德路上行经六个路口
He always travels the same six blocks of Halsted.

716
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,870
你有三个路口的时间杀他
You have three blocks to kill him.

720
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,590
妈的
Shit.

722
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,840
对不起
I'm sorry.

723
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:36,310
巴里你能喂下安娜蓓尔吗
CATHY: Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?

724
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:38,610
巴里
Barry!

725
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:47,030
韦斯利  你跑哪去了  我很想念你  老弟
Wesley. Hey, where have you been? I have really missed you, man.

726
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:53,250
瞧你这好汉  操你妈的混蛋  怎么
Look at the big man. You fucking asshole! What?

727
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,540
怎么你失踪了几个礼拜
What? You don't show up for weeks,

728
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,250
现在只是来借个厕所
now you're just gonna stop by and use the bathroom?

729
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:59,840
你以为你是什么大人物了  是吧
You think you're a real big shot now, huh?

730
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,300
不  你知道吗  你什么屁都不是
No. You know what? You are nothing!

731
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,760
不  你连屁都不如
No, you are less than nothing.

732
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,140
你比半个巴里都不如
You're not even half the man that Barry is.

733
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:12,680
巴里至少能让我享受到  你想像不到的快乐
Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of!

734
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:19,900
她是谁  韦斯利  你的新婊子
Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore?

735
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,230
你堕落到这种程度需要花钱买了
Is that what it takes now? You're paying for it?

737
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,100
韦斯利
Wesley?

738
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,100
他是好汉
He's the man.

739
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,110
你还好吗  还好
You all right? Yeah.

740
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:14,700
我没事  坐下  我帮你找台车
Yeah. I'm okay. Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.

741
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,620
今晚很重要  我必须去康复室
Big night. I got to get into recovery.

744
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,170
妈的
Shit.

745
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,140
操
Fuck!

756
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,180
正中红心
Bull's -eye.

757
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,020
他在这干嘛
What's he doing here?

759
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:49,200
拜托  拜托  振作点
Come on! Come on. Just stay with us.

760
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,700
把他的夹克拉下
Pull back his jacket.

762
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,170
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe. Breathe, all right?

764
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:04,920
没事的  没事的  没事的
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

765
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,180
一千
A thousand.

766
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,630
拜托
Come on!

767
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,430
拜托  不  不  别死
Come on! No! No! Stay with us.

768
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:12,640
拜托  张开你的眼睛
Come on.Open your eyes!

769
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,060
快呀
Come on!

770
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,180
拜托
Come on!

771
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,850
拜托
Come on!

773
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:12,740
这颗子弹是他使用过的第一颗  能够追踪到来源的子弹
This bullet is the first traceable bullet he's ever used.

774
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,450
是这个人制造的  他叫沛克华斯基
It was made by this man. His name is Pekwarsky.

775
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:21,040
他的工作地点在东摩拉维亚修道院
He works out of what is now a monastery in Eastern Moravia.

776
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,040
这地方是兄弟会的诞生地
This place is where the Fraternity was born.

777
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,040
他在向我挑衅
He's taunting me.

778
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,170
他在传输一道讯息给我
He's sending me a message.

779
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,760
我也要传个讯息回去
I'm gonna send him one back.

780
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,760
他对你设了陷阱
He's trapping you.

781
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,220
引诱你到他的地盘
Leading you to a place he knows very well.

782
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,180
这些我都知道  我…
Look, I know this. I...

783
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:45,890
你训练我就是为了这个
This is what you trained me for.

784
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,350
你不能单独行动
You can't go alone.

785
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:50,560
如果我不单独去他就不会出现  他可不是笨蛋
I go alone or he doesn't show. He's not stupid.

786
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:55,610
听好  兄弟会的一个成员因我而死
Look, a member of the Fraternity is dead because of me.

787
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,240
好吧
Okay.

788
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:05,700
去吧
Go.

789
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,000
谢谢
Thank you.

790
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,420
我不认为那是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

791
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,020
你的下个任务
Your next assignment.

792
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,980
沛克华斯基
Pekwarsky?

793
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,290
妈的
Shit.

794
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,250
你在这干嘛
What are you doing here?

796
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,170
把你的枪放下
Lower your gun.

798
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,520
你知道这东西
You recognise this?

799
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,520
这是从我肩膀里取出来的
I pulled this out of my shoulder.

800
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,190
把它弄到我肩膀里的人就是杀我爸爸的人
The guy who put it there killed my father.

801
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:22,480
我知道子弹是你制造的  告诉我他在哪里
Now, I know you made it, so tell me where he is.

802
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:26,530
子弹的确是我做的  但我不能为使用它的人负责
I did mould this, but I can't be responsible for the people who use them.

803
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,610
我不管  告诉我他在哪里
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.

804
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,360
看看我的手指
Look at my finger.

805
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:36,080
我可以试着让你们会面
I can try and arrange a meet.

807
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:02,390
你有没有想过过不同的生活
Have you ever thought about doing things differently?

808
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,100
什么意思
How do you mean?

809
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,730
不知道
I don't know.

810
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,900
做另一个人
Being somebody else.

811
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,900
一个平凡人
Somebody normal.

812
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:20,120
没有
No.

814
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,250
妈的
Shit.

815
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,670
闪开
Out of the way!

819
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,200
别动
Stay.

820
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,140
嘿
Hey!

821
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,220
他在火车上
He's on the train.

822
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,060
他单独一人
He's alone.

823
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,890
谢谢
Thank you.

826
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,870
对不起  对不起  坐下
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!

827
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,460
先生  坐下没人会受伤
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.

828
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:02,630
先生  坐…坐下  先生  坐下
Sir, sit... Sit down! Sir, sit down!

830
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,560
闪开  坐下  坐下  坐下
Get out of the way! Sit down! Stay down! Stay down!

831
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,480
坐下  没事  坐下
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!

833
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:31,280
韦斯利
Wesley.

834
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:42,250
闪开  闪开
Out of the way! Out of the way!

837
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,340
不  不  不
No, no, no!

839
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,810
韦斯利  听我说
Wesley, listen to me.

840
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,860
闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

841
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,110
你不配跟我说话
You don't get to talk to me.

842
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:39,740
你不配跟我说话
You don't get to talk to me.

843
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,610
他们告诉你的都是谎言
Everything they told you was a lie.

844
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,830
闭嘴  你他妈的骗人  闭上你的鸟嘴
Shut up, you lying piece of shit. You shut the fuck up.

845
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:49,410
你是我儿子
You are my son.

847
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,130
你说什么
What did you say?

848
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:58,750
你刚说什么
What did you say to me?

850
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,030
是真的
Is it true?

851
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,870
对
Yes.

852
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,710
你为什么要我这么做
Why did you make me do this?

853
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:45,000
因为你是唯一他杀不了的人
Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.

855
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,760
你早知道了  他妈的
You knew, God damn it.

856
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,140
你从头就知道
You knew the entire time.

857
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,180
他的名字出现了
Well, his name came up.

858
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,810
你的也是
So did yours.

861
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,210
不  没关系  没事
No, it was okay. Never mind.

862
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:53,260
不  不  这一切都是乱来
No. No, it was complete shit.

863
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,200
我答应了你父亲把你带回来这里
I promised your father I'd bring you back here.

864
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,820
什么
What the fuck?

865
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:22,030
他说这是唯一让你相信的方法
He said it was the only way you'd believe.

866
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:32,710
你爸爸一直都在你身边
Your father was never more than a camera click away.

867
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,140
那是我
That's me.

868
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,110
他是我爸爸
He was my father.

869
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,110
而我杀了他
And I killed him.

870
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:05,450
对你父亲来说  保护你比自己的生命还重要
To your father, protecting you was worth giving up his life.

871
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,120
保护我
Protect me?

872
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:11,290
他他妈的差点杀了我
He was trying to fucking kill me!

873
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:15,040
不  他根本没有要杀你
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.

874
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:17,960
他是在救你
He was trying to rescue you.

875
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,430
十字架离开兄弟会后
When Cross left the Fraternity,

876
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,470
斯隆找到了你
Sloan hunted you down.

877
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:35,190
自从狐狸盯上你后  他就一直试着把你从他们身边分开
Ever since Fox had her teeth in you, he's been trying to separate you from them.

878
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,480
你爸爸从来不想让你进兄弟会  韦斯利
Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley.

879
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:45,320
他想给你一个不同的人生
He wanted a different path for you,

880
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,330
给你他永远得不到的东西
with things that he could never have.

881
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,370
一个家
A home.

882
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:58,000
和平  不
Peace. No.

883
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,580
他希望你能找到自己的前途
He hoped you would find your own way.

884
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:10,510
你爸爸找到了这个
Your father got hold of this.

885
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:14,470
你自己解读吧
Decipher it yourself.

886
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:26,190
斯隆几年前为了私欲开始自己伪造目标
Sloan began manufacturing targets of his own for profit years ago.

887
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:30,530
你爸爸得知了这件事
Your father found out about it.

888
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:33,360
他原本想要用自己的方法解决
And he was going to do something about it on his own, right?

889
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:36,280
但斯隆却说服了所有人敌对他
But Sloan turned everyone against him.

890
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,830
我父亲的名字从来就没出现过  对不对
WESLEY: My father's name never even came up, did it?

891
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,950
因为他遵遁规章反而让他成了目标
No. Holding to the code made him a target.

892
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,820
斯隆

893
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,710
对
Yes.

894
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,520
你要我逃跑  不
You want me to run? No.

895
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,980
我想要你活着
I want you to live.

896
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:11,110
你可以过着不同的生活  韦斯利
You can have a different life, Wesley.

897
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:14,570
就如你父亲所希望的
Like your father wanted for you.

898
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,220
我们把他训练得很好
We trained him well.

899
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:29,380
我爸爸说错了一件事
My father was wrong about one thing.

900
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:32,180
他们告诉我的并非全部是谎言
Everything they told me wasn't a lie.

901
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,560
他们教我如何杀人  如何抛弃情感
They taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain,

902
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,600
最重要的是  所有的任务都有一个最完美的武器
and most importantly, that every job has a perfect weapon.

903
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:45,730
我就是那完美的武器
Well, I'm the perfect weapon.

904
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,860
而我现在却要逃跑
And I'm supposed to run?

905
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,530
不  我已经逃避了一辈子
No, I've been doing that my entire life.

906
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,450
所以我拒绝
So I say no.

907
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,990
我要杀了他们  让命运来决定其它的事情
I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess.

909
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,170
杀了他
Kill him.

912
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,640
他在这里
He's here!

924
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:01,000
胆小鬼
Pussy.

925
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:04,080
胆小鬼  胆小鬼
Pussy, pussy.

927
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,970
胆小鬼  胆小鬼
Pussy, pussy.

928
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,310
胆小鬼
Pussy.

934
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:34,000
斯隆
Sloan!

935
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:54,270
我爸爸不是叛徒
My father wasn't a traitor.

936
01:33:57,690 --> 01:33:59,520
这是个杀人命令
This is a kill order.

937
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:04,550
而目标正是斯隆
And it's got Sloan's name on it.

938
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,970
你说过什么
What did you say to me?

939
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,890
是个名字  是个目标
It's a name. It's a target.

940
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:18,310
我不想要他死
I don't want this person dead.

941
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:20,690
是命运要他死
Fate does.

942
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:26,320
命运要你死
Fate wanted you dead.

943
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,030
他无法接受
And he couldn't take it.

944
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:34,160
所以他开始伪造一些目标来图利
So he started manufacturing his own targets for his own gains.

945
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:39,000
我爸得知了这件事  而决定与他对抗
And that's when my dad found out and decided to stand against him.

946
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:43,790
而你就利用他的儿子
And that's when you sent a man's son

947
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,790
去杀了自己的爸爸
to kill his father.

948
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,680
你不是命运的剌客  斯隆
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.

949
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:56,260
你只是个能让子弹转弯的坏人
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.

950
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,360
是真的吗
Is that true?

951
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:23,450
事实是这样的
Here is what the truth is.

952
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,080
你的名字出现了
Your name came up.

953
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,010
你的名字出现了
Your name came up.

954
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,030
你的名字出现了
Your name came up.

955
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:02,360
你的名字
Your name.

956
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:05,370
你的名字
Your name.

957
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:07,370
你的
Yours.

958
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,830
这房里的所有人
Everyone in this room.

959
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,880
如果我当时没那么做
If I had not done what I did,

960
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:23,220
你们都已经死了
you would all be dead.

961
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,850
我救了你们的命
I saved your lives.

962
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:33,480
看看现在的我们  比以往更加强大
Now look where we are. We are stronger than ever.

963
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:37,690
用我们的能力改变历史
Changing the course of history as we see it.

964
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:42,070
我们自己决定目标
Choosing the targets we select.

965
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:47,990
将权力分配到需要的地方
We can redistribute power where we see fit.

966
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:52,120
这是强者生存的世界
The wolves rule.

967
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,580
弱者只能死去
Not the sheep.

968
01:36:57,620 --> 01:37:00,960
如果你们认为必须完全
Now, if any of you feel the need to follow the code

969
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:03,520
遵照兄弟会的规章
of the Fraternity to the letter,

970
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:08,110
那请你们举起枪
I invite you to take your gun,

971
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,070
放到自己的嘴里  然后扣下扳机
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.

972
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,370
那是韦斯利想要的
That is what Wesley demands.

973
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,410
否则
Otherwise,

974
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,920
杀了这他妈的混蛋
shoot this motherfucker

975
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,300
让我们把兄弟会杀手带上前所未有的高度
and let us take our Fraternity of Assassins to heights

976
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:29,010
一个只适合神的高度
reserved only for the gods of men.

977
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,300
你的选择
You choose.

978
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,940
去他妈的规章
Fuck the code.

981
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,540
斯隆
Sloan!

983
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:24,240
斯隆
Sloan!

985
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:44,420
六个礼拜前  我只是个平凡无奇的人
Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.

986
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:48,180
就像你
Just like you.

987
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:53,050
但现在呢
But who am I now?

988
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,180
是帐户经理
Account manager?

989
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,900
杀手
Assassin?

990
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:07,120
或只是一个被利用来杀死自己父亲的工具
Or just another tool who was mind-fucked into killing his father?

991
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,790
我都是
I am all of these.

992
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,750
也都不是
And I am none of these.

993
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,090
我现在是谁
Who am I now?

994
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:52,160
我并没有达成我的使命
This is not me fulfilling my destiny.

996
01:40:57,330 --> 01:41:00,330
我并没有追随父亲的脚步
This is not me following in my father's footsteps.

997
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:07,800
我也绝对没有拯救世界
This is definitely not me saving the world.

999
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:29,190
还想知道你是谁
Still trying to figure out who you are?

1000
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,450
这不是我
This is not me.

1001
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:37,870
这是另一个他妈的圈套
This is just a motherfucking decoy.

1002
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,880
操
Oh, fuck.

1004
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:52,800
这是我控制情势
This is me taking control.

1005
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,840
不被斯隆
From Sloan,

1006
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,510
不被兄弟会
from the Fraternity,

1007
01:41:58,890 --> 01:42:02,390
不被珍妮丝  不被报表
from Janice, from billing reports,

1008
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:05,190
不被人体工学键盘
from ergonomic keyboards,

1009
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:08,940
不被劈腿女友  不被假惺惺的挚友所控制
from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best friends.

1010
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:13,570
这是我再一次重新掌握
This is me taking back control

1011
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,860
自己的人生
of my life.

1012
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:21,910
你最近做了些什么
What the fuck have you done lately?
