1
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:32,308
â™ª Ooh yeah

2
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:48,910
Oh shit. Hey man,
I gotta get to Brooklyn,
I gotta get to work,

3
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:51,672
open the bar,
I gotta work
on this audition
for the morning.

4
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,260
What're you
going in on?

5
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:56,642
Now is this scene
before or after
you saw your
own leg off?

6
00:00:56,677 --> 00:01:01,337
I've seen slaves breaking
their backs in the fields.
Have you?

7
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:07,964
Pardon me, pardon me,
I'm very sorry. No, we
should head out. We
gotta be there at four.

8
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:13,659
That's enough, from both of you.
And you...wait. That's enough.

9
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:15,144
We need you
up there, kid.

10
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,630
I'll be right up.

11
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:23,152
Brother, prepping an audition
or doing an audition, or
resting from an audition.

12
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:27,742
You can never commit,
because you never know,
you might get a job, but
you never do get a job.

13
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,055
Sorry, but you don't.

14
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,543
Okay, who needs what?

15
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,753
These three here,
we need two Ripostos
one Fellini.

16
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:42,619
I don't know what
he wants, and that
freak down there,
I'm not certain.

17
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh shit, is that Raphael?

18
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:49,212
I was a gay on
the Woody Allen
movie you did.

19
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:51,352
I'm gonna be right
with you.
Just kidding.

20
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:56,081
I knew you had a small part
but you were great. Thought
you were gonna be huge!

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,186
What happened?

22
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:06,919
When I headed
for that door
I realized

23
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:09,922
if I went out,
I would never
come back.

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,236
I didn't want to
never come back

25
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:19,104
but I couldn't come
back out onto the stage, so

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,900
there wasn't anything left
so I went up the ladder.

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,285
You're The King.
The King. You're
Joe Strummer.

28
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,425
- I'm Joe Strummer.
- You're a sonic producer.

29
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,772
I'm a sonic producer!

30
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:37,053
I think I liked it.
If you don't mind
I wanna sit for
the second scene.

31
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:39,987
Sure, no.
What you did,
really good.

32
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:44,233
Really good.
Very good, thanks.

33
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,890
I don't know what else
to tell you. You're in
an age void.

34
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:50,204
Would you like
a Peroni?

35
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,620
I want you to change
your attitude, chief.

36
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:56,486
I want you to ask
me again, and this
time, with a smile.

37
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:05,115
Go fuck yourself!
Get the fuck out!

38
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:08,153
Yeah, we will get
the fuck out of here!

39
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,536
- Look at me, look at me.
- Dude I can't do this anymore.
I'm gonna fucking kill someone.

40
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:23,237
- In an age void.
- What?

41
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:25,412
They don't know what
to do with me. That's
the problem.

42
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:28,415
Look, it's Lincoln Center.
It's a cultural superstore.

43
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:33,316
It's white boy business,
I mean, you getting that
part is a long shot,
come on!

44
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:35,974
Well what's the point
then, Raph?

45
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,632
Please, tell me,
I mean it's the same
five directors,

46
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,048
the same 10 writers,
the same 20 actors,

47
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:45,294
they just do everything!
It's not good for theaters,
it's fucking boring.

48
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:47,779
Look, it's a tight circle,
we're not part of it.

49
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:52,093
You know the days
of Joe Papp, off
the street, the living
theater, that's done!

50
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,510
Who's off the street?
I'm trained, well trained.

51
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,650
- I know you're trained.
- I went to conservatory!

52
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:59,756
Yeah but you didn't go
to Juilliard, and that's
what this is all about, right?

53
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,795
What big shows you were in,
who saw you do it, my dad
is Edward Albee, all that kind
of stuff.

54
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,417
- Edward Albee doesn't
have kids.
- I know.

55
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:07,385
- He's gay.
- Doesn't mean he
doesn't have kids.

56
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,973
- But he doesn't.
- Hey, Dom!
Who's this, your pimp?

57
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,285
Hey, how you doing,
what a sight!

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,495
You look fantastic. Look who
it is, Kaplan!

59
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,740
Hey don't mind us.
We were running
a scene right now...

60
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:22,331
I can't believe I'm running
into you maniacs, you guys
have been on my mind all week!

61
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:24,194
- Was it in a naughty way?
- Take it easy.

62
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,162
It's always a little
naughty with you, Raphael.

63
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:28,198
Tell us the less naughty
parts for now.

64
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,684
All right. That was an amazing
night at your bar last month.

65
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:33,549
We've had so many amazing nights
at the bar with you, Kaplan.

66
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,206
No, we were talking movies
with your writer friend,
Jonathan.

67
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,864
- You had those leather
pants on!
- We love those pants.

68
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:43,075
Wasn't Jonathan talking about
doing some low budget Raymond
Chandler detective story thing?

69
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,630
- No.
- That was our idea.

70
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,977
Who was mentioning
the Sweet Smell of Success?

71
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,634
- "Match me, Sidney"
- Match me.

72
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:53,431
I love that movie.
What's Jonathan up to?
I love his show.

73
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,399
Can you get me in touch?
I promised my boss I'd
find something interesting

74
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,159
for him to produce
for under 300 grand,

75
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:00,610
he's looking to shuffle
some money around
on a tax credit thing.

76
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:04,787
I don't know what
Jonathan' up to, but
we wrote that script.

77
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,858
- It's written, it's done.
- What script?

78
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,758
- The Raymond Chandler thing.
- We're burning down
the cultural superstar rasta.

79
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:15,245
Wow, look at you guys,
that's great. Did you write
parts for yourselves?

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,594
- Of course.
- Yeah, we're the leads.
We play brothers.

81
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,355
Okay, well what's
it about?

82
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,981
Don't be shy, Dominic.
Tell Kaplan what it's about.

83
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:29,915
It's, uh, well,
basically, um...

84
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,539
- Well, we play brothers.
- Yeah, I got that.

85
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:37,060
And, you know, we own
a detective agency.

86
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:39,822
- And it's a noir.
- Absolutely.

87
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,376
Uh, you know,
basically...

88
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:47,968
Well, it's an elevated
genre film. At least
that's how aunt
Carrie described it.

89
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:50,591
- Aunt Carrie read it?
- Yeah, she loved it.

90
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,938
How the hell did
you get aunt Carrie
to read it?

91
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,526
- No offense.
- None taken.

92
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:57,253
- We know some people.
- Yeah, we're tapped in.

93
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,151
Well, what'd she say?

94
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:01,257
She said, er, what did
she say, Raph?

95
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,293
- Said it was raw.
- Yeah, oh yeah.

96
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,193
She said it was really
raw and original,

97
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:08,713
and that she'd love
to get her hands on it.

98
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,680
It's called
"The Blackmailers
Don't Shoot."

99
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,924
- Or maybe "The Black Mask."
- Yeah, I like that one.

100
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,962
What the fuck, is it low
budget? You guys think
you can make it for under
300 k?

101
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:19,620
- Oh, yeah.
- Super low. Really low.

102
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,553
- Less than that.
- This sounds perfect.

103
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:26,213
My boss is looking
for something new.
I get to produce
this project.

104
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:27,939
Show me the script,
let's do this.

105
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:31,356
No wait, hold on
a minute, you know...

106
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,600
We're doing rewrites,
we're swamped, you know,
we can't.

107
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:36,948
This money goes away in two
weeks, we don't have to jump
through any hoops with them.

108
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:39,847
- I just need to see the script.
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

109
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,987
Look I get you guys,
I always have.

110
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:47,061
I can give you ten days,
that's it. But we're meeting
with other writers, so get
it to me.

111
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:50,582
How you gonna get out
of this. We don't even
know aunt Carrie.

112
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,170
I auditioned for her once.

113
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,795
- You can't write a script
in ten days.
- Yes, but we can.

114
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,418
We, together.

115
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,835
Come on, we've been talking
about doing this for years.

116
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:07,012
I have an idea.
What do writers do?
They go to the country.

117
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:12,535
We'll go to the country.
To my sister's house.
We'll have it all to ourselves.

118
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,539
Peace, quiet,
no distractions...

119
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,818
Let's just get there,
get down, and do it.

120
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,499
Photosynthesis baby.

121
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,160
Oh, I forgot how
peaceful it is in
the country.

122
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,267
Nature will flip
you, Dominic.

123
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,306
Flip you for real,
remember that.

124
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,521
Yeah!

125
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:57,433
Police activity,
people. stay back.

126
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,747
- Dominic, grab the bags.
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:09,928
That's very cute.
Very cute.

128
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:14,312
To Gigi's country manor.

129
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:20,456
- Starting tomorrow, I think
we should cleanse it out.
- No booze.

130
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,665
I saw this documentary
on Ingmar Bergman

131
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,702
- at the Film Forum.
- I love the Film Forum.

132
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:28,360
He said the demons
want you to stay in
bed with cold feet.

133
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:33,262
So the first thing he does
is he gets up in the morning
and he takes a walk.

134
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:35,609
And then he writes.

135
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,136
You want some gross
character of a woman!

136
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,622
That means power makes you
more masculine, and masculine
means you're ugly.

137
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:51,625
Well shame on you,
you macho shithead!

138
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,627
All right, fuck this.
Eureka!

139
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:57,527
Yes, that's it!
It's a simple
missing persons case.

140
00:09:57,562 --> 00:10:00,013
Gets more evolved
when we find the girl.

141
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,568
- Recognize!
- It's a character piece,

142
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,156
- masked as a noir,
- wonderful.

143
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,295
Wonderful, wonderful!

144
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:07,986
Maybe a dubonnet with a twist.

145
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,298
It's a secret!

146
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,196
Corruption that echoes
the world in which they live.

147
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:13,647
Yes, uh,
dark shame.

148
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,861
It could be
a double cross.

149
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,207
Could be,
a double cross.

150
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:23,761
- Genius!
- Yeah!

151
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:56,138
Maybe she joins a group, a cult, like the Source Family.

152
00:10:56,172 --> 00:11:01,868
A cult could be fun.
It's a period piece,
but maybe we
make it a mash up.

153
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:04,698
Set in Los Angeles over
a 24 hour sequence.

154
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,838
Some dialog,
dancing but heavy,

155
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,529
like The Umbrellas
of Cherbourg.

156
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:10,393
- I love that movie.
- Okay, so, dancing...

157
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,809
Mm hm.

158
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,535
- In a noir.
- Yep.

159
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,885
That's good, right,
we haven't seen that!
That's good.

160
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,819
Okay, so, she--

161
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:24,649
Who's...who's that?

162
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,518
That's what I
wanna know.

163
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,848
- Hello.
- Hi.

164
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,470
How you doing?

165
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:56,025
- You must be Dominic.
- How do you know
who I am?

166
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,269
I've seen
pictures of you.

167
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:01,617
Er...Where?

168
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:05,759
In Gigi's store. I used
to work there, I'm Ava.

169
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:08,935
Oh, yeah. How is it
we've never met?

170
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:11,765
- I guess we've just never
seen each other.
- You don't look like an Ava.

171
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,287
- What does an Ava look like.
- You change your name? Let me
see your ID. Got your passport?

172
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:19,428
Some outfit you have on.
Is your name Lawrence
by any chance?

173
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:21,775
Of Arabia? Close,
Raphael, of Brooklyn.

174
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,812
You wanna borrow this?
I got this one in Marrakesh,

175
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:26,711
Okay, Ava, Ava,
here's the, um...

176
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,473
Raphael, Brooklyn and I,
we really need to be alone.

177
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:32,682
So, um...

178
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,546
What you doing here?

179
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:36,963
Planting flowers.
I'm doing Gigi a favor.

180
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:39,689
My friend Carl is going
to do a shoot here in
a couple of weeks.

181
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,588
Okay, Gigi, she didn't
tell me anything about this.

182
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:44,902
- Don't worry about it.
We're the king of this castle.
- Something wrong?

183
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,387
Here's the thing, Ava.
We're up here to write.

184
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:51,391
- We've been contracted
to write a screenplay.
- We have nine days to finish.

185
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:55,257
I'll be very quiet.
Like a mouse.

186
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,638
Like a mouse.

187
00:12:57,673 --> 00:12:59,261
I'm staying out
in the trailer.

188
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,021
Well, why you
doing that?

189
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:05,129
- Why not?
- Okay, see. I just wanna
set the right tone.

190
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:07,787
The tone is set.

191
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:16,209
Now look.

192
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,831
That girl is very hot.

193
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:20,385
- I can see that.
- Just stay calm.

194
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,767
I can't control
the bitches worldwide.

195
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,874
Yeah, okay, this...
This is gonna be a problem.

196
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,773
- It's probably Karl Lagerfeld.
- What?

197
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,603
Why are
we whispering?

198
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:36,022
- What, what?
- Her friend who's gonna shoot
here in a couple of weeks.

199
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:41,890
- It's probably Karl Lagerfeld,
the famous designer.
- Yes, I know who he is, bitch.

200
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:55,006
What are you guys
whispering about?

201
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:57,975
Ingmar Bergman.

202
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:02,980
I told you.

203
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:04,913
We don't trust something
about her, correct?

204
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,363
We don't trust something
about anyone.
We're detectives.

205
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:08,744
Why hasn't she gone
to the police?

206
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,228
She wants to keep it
out of the paper.

207
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:12,852
Wants to use discretion
doesn't want anything
to go on record.

208
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,164
She's got an aversion
to celebrity culture.

209
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,063
Are you guys
going somewhere?

210
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,133
- Yeah.
- No.

211
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,720
Why?

212
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:23,793
You're sitting in your car.
I was hoping you could
give me a lift to the store.

213
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:26,693
- We can't.
- Absolutely. Why not?

214
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:29,765
Okay, I'm gonna walk then.
Do you guys need anything?

215
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,803
- No, no thank you. We're cool.
- Do you want some Red Bull?

216
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,323
- Are you kidding?
- For the writing.

217
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,049
No we're keeping it clean.

218
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:39,948
Okay.

219
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,052
Bye.

220
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:50,372
Ava, can you get me some
bittersweet chocolate,
some vanilla ice cream,

221
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,753
some cookies and maybe
some beef jerky.

222
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:56,723
- Don't go crazy. Just get
one or the other.
- Worry about yourself, damn!

223
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:59,001
Ava!

224
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:01,107
Just make it vanilla
swiss almond!

225
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:05,490
- Okay.
- And some condoms.

226
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:09,218
- I think you should fuck her.
- I'm absolutely not going
to fuck her!

227
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,324
- It'll open you wide up.
- I'm here to write.

228
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:12,808
- I'm writing!
- You can do both.

229
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:18,020
- Are you drinking a Red Bull?
- It's Prosecco.

230
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:23,267
Mm, ugh.
That's Red Bull.
Why would you
drink that?

231
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:27,650
You wanna work
all night? You wanna
be a big time writer?

232
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:30,101
Try something before
you dismiss it!

233
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:33,829
Put down the hand sanitizer
and get a little messy.

234
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:37,695
Gonna feel like
a tarantula.

235
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,190
What the fuck was that?

236
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,552
Whoa! Gigi!

237
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:12,764
Oh, my God, what are you
doing here? Are you okay?
Are you all right?

238
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,802
Gigi, what're you...
Have you been drinking?

239
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:18,322
Have you...
You're wasted!

240
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,565
Gi--

241
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,189
Raphael!
Raphael.

242
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,570
- Raphael.
- Gigi!

243
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:36,167
What are you doing
for fun these days?

244
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:39,964
I don't know, stranger,
what have you been doing
for fun these days.

245
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,967
Think we owe
each other
about three
happy new years.

246
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,419
- She drove here drunk.
- Oh, give it a rest!

247
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:50,664
I didn't drive anywhere.
I stopped for a second
or something.

248
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,495
Can't you see she needs
taking care of, Dominic?

249
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,945
Aw you!
You are in tune.

250
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,121
You simply tune in.
You always have.

251
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:00,674
Gigi!

252
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,026
My little darling!

253
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,133
Bring 'em more water please.
The last thing I want...
Okay, wow.

254
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:17,001
Splish, splash,
I feel fantastic!

255
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,004
Dom, you wanna get in there
and make it a family affair?

256
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,905
I'm so happy we're all
here. It's wide open.

257
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,425
- You guys have known each
other a while, right?
- Yeah.

258
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,912
- Raphael was
her boyfriend, sort of.
- What do you mean,
sort of?

259
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:34,191
Whatever they were.
That was way back.

260
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:35,192
Hey!

261
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:39,679
Yes, it's true. Raph was
my boyfriend, sort of.

262
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:46,651
- Speaking of, where's Wayne?
- Don't mention Wayne, no no,
don't mention Wayne.

263
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:49,068
Why not, why?
What happened now?

264
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,935
He has some nerve.
That's all I'll say.

265
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,835
Raph and I have a lotta work
to do tonight so we might have--

266
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,320
Not a bubble bath
without some bubbly.

267
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,115
Yes!

268
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,189
Please man.

269
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,123
Because I love it when a man
brings me champagne!

270
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:13,126
The honey is flowing
in all directions!

271
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:28,659
Yeah, get up.
Let's go.
We're leaving.

272
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:47,264
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

273
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:50,957
- Why?
- Why do you think?

274
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,242
Dominic. Dominic!

275
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,451
- What?
- I was losing my mind!

276
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:07,180
You can't leave, I practically
crashed the car into the house
last night. I drove drunk.

277
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:09,803
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time.

278
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,569
Get off!

279
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:25,405
I don't wanna be
alone right now.

280
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,338
Well I do!

281
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:33,137
- G, stop it.
- Why can't you stay?

282
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,831
- Because, I need to focus!
- So focus!

283
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,868
It's a really big house.

284
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:46,461
- Do you like that?
- I need you! I might
be at the end of a rope.

285
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,601
Fine, all right,
I'll stay!

286
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,362
Savage!

287
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:04,548
- Gorilla.
- Pussy!

288
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:09,656
What's up with my brother,
what are you feeding him?

289
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:12,245
Roast turkey and Miles
Davis of course.

290
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:20,253
Had a dream about
you last night, G.

291
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:25,396
That sounds
promising.

292
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:32,231
You were telling me
you wanted to sell
your shadow for 60
dollars.

293
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:38,271
- I could get more
than 60 bucks.
- I bet you could.

294
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:40,480
Hey would you mind
reading this with me?

295
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:50,801
I'm tired of my shadow
pinpointing exactly
where I am.

296
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,044
I'm not sure
that I follow.

297
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,529
I want to be rid of it.

298
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,635
It's not that simple, lady.

299
00:20:58,464 --> 00:20:59,913
Neither am I.

300
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:02,468
There's no turning back,
you understand?

301
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,504
Someone else could find
a better use for it.

302
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:06,886
It got a little complicated...

303
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:13,410
Missed you.

304
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:17,586
Change of plans.
We're not leaving.

305
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:22,764
So, upstairs in five,
back to work.
Is this hot?

306
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,424
G, just so you know,
you fucked up my rib,
really bad.
It's killing me.

307
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,428
- Let's go. Back to work.
- So...

308
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,813
...you write and then
you dream, or you dream
and then you write?

309
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:41,507
- Which comes first?
- I dunno, that's
a good question.

310
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,406
Sometimes I think
the dream is writing me.

311
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,696
- So if we find her,
why don't we bring her back?
- I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

312
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:00,560
Because if we bring
her back,
the movie ends.

313
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:03,322
I'm not so sure
about that,
I'm not sure at all.

314
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,185
What's so special
about this cult?

315
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,260
Primary colors, Stanley
the dog, abandoned peers.
Keep that close,
abandoned peers.

316
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:15,713
Snails. A quote:
trans-cranial
magnetic stimulation.

317
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,474
Grapefruit the size
of cannonballs.

318
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:22,962
The realism of nature combined
with the serial-ism of nature,
aka, whimsy. Aha!

319
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:24,412
What?

320
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:30,107
Carlos Puyol beats
Real Madrid
with his head.
With his head!

321
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:34,456
Raph, Raph, Raph.
What? Okay, what
is all that? Where
you going with all this?

322
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:37,597
You see how quickly
young Ava dropped her robe?

323
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:40,082
You gotta love a girl
who can think on her
feet, huh?

324
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:43,431
If you're a man with sight,
you'll notice she had a little
fur down there.

325
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:47,055
I've been wondering for some
time now if the kids have been
bringing bush back.

326
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:50,058
Kojakhas been ruling
the area for a long time now.

327
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:53,095
Back in the day,
your sister
had a full on Joan Baez.

328
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,582
- Okay, stop, stop.
Please, stop!
- What? What?

329
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,964
These are my notes.

330
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:02,139
These are things
that can
spark my vision.

331
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,831
We have to stick with it
to get somewhere.

332
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:09,905
I need to circle the muse.
I need to let the character
emerge. I'm not a machine!

333
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,323
You need to circle.
You seem to circle
a lotta things.

334
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:16,636
Oh, I see what's
happening here.

335
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:19,674
I'm just saying man,
sometimes, you gotta push.

336
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:24,368
Man, you gotta jump!

337
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,681
All right!
Okay! All right!

338
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:30,961
Just forget it, forget it!
Back to the story, okay?
Back to the story.

339
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:34,723
Just give me something
real man, something deep,
something truthful!

340
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:41,005
Oh, it rubs me the wrong way
when you say deep, and truth.
It just rubs me the wrong way!

341
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,699
The guy who wants success
in ten days. The guy who
wants everything now.

342
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:47,287
That guy's gonna talk to me
about truth, about death?

343
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,738
- You don't wanna get in there.
- Get in where, get in where?

344
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,327
You're just saying words,
I dunno what you're
talking about!

345
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:54,743
This is the omphalos
of the entire story.

346
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:58,195
- The omphalos?
- The navel, the central point?

347
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,852
Fuck you,
word of the day.

348
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,767
You gotta be kidding.

349
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:30,365
Dark, Mediterranean man
sits at his computer,

350
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,505
a pensive look
on his face.

351
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,198
- Hi, Ava.
- The curious girl
enters the room.

352
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:44,931
Hey, look, Ava, you're a really
nice girl, but I thought you
were gonna be quiet as a mouse.

353
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:49,660
His brow tightens,
she offers him a drink.
This is for you.

354
00:24:57,012 --> 00:25:00,015
No, I wasn't. I was
just waving to you and I was...

355
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,742
Look at those two.
They can't resist.

356
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:07,367
- How's the writing?
- I'm stuck.

357
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,266
On what?

358
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,341
Um, in...

359
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,792
In the story, my
character's hired to

360
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,035
find this girl who's
wrapped up in a cult.

361
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,660
I find her, I don't know
what happens next.
She's in some kind
of trouble.

362
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:27,008
Well, I know all
about trouble.

363
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:30,252
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

364
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:33,428
Well, what kind of trouble
have you been wrapped up in?

365
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:35,810
It depends how
you define trouble.

366
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,676
Sometimes trouble
give you the answers.

367
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:44,922
Maybe your character
is conflicted.

368
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:51,584
This girl is drawn to you.
She's involved in something
that intrigues you.

369
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:54,656
Question is,
do you explore it?

370
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,834
Or maybe he's
falling for her.

371
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:07,980
Anyway, if you get stuck
again, give me a holler.

372
00:26:50,574 --> 00:26:54,302
So he buys me this
'66 Barracuda Fastback.

373
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,546
Pearl white, burgundy bucket
seats, I love it.

374
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,100
- And Wayne loves it.
- I love it.

375
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,551
For about a week. And then
the next week he's just
in his shell.

376
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:08,661
He's curled up, he won't get
out of bed, and he's angry.
So angry about everything!

377
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:11,112
Then suddenly decides he
wants to get rid of it.

378
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:12,700
- What!
- Not just the car.

379
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:15,323
He's suddenly obsessed
with the Ramapough Indians.

380
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:19,638
- To what end, I have no idea!
- Is that a new thing?

381
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:25,989
He's riding the Staten Island
ferry back and forth. He's not
going to Staten Island, he's
just riding the ferry.

382
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:28,612
Says he needs
to stay on the water.

383
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,718
I don't know what's
going on with him.

384
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:35,136
Maybe it's everything going on
in the world right now. Maybe
that's what's setting him off.

385
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,586
- Yeah.
- I dunno.

386
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,968
We were so good for so long.

387
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:46,699
- And now, we're not connected.
- Not working.

388
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:49,219
I feel like he's
bamboozling me,
unless maybe it's me.

389
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,428
- No it's not.
- No, my man is fucked up.

390
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:57,330
I'm sorry, G. I love you, but
he's got some serious issues.
He was in a war.

391
00:27:57,365 --> 00:28:00,126
Then he was
fucking Team Six.

392
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:02,715
- What's Team Six?
- It means he was elite.

393
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,337
Okay, the best at
what he did.

394
00:28:04,372 --> 00:28:09,584
Anything after that,
it has to feel like a
let down to some degree.

395
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:11,724
- She's no let down!
- Yeah man.

396
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,661
No, you know what I mean.
I don't mean that. It's just
that now he's a...
he's a glorified handyman.

397
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:22,701
Let's not glorify the fact
that Wayne is a product
of the military industrial
complex.

398
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:26,877
It's sad, but he
made choices.
What I know,

399
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:32,020
is Gigi here is a radiant
sunflower. And one who
appreciates the sun,

400
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:33,712
certainly loves
sunflowers.

401
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,856
You're in love with him.
It's really simple.

402
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:45,862
Battle of the sexes,
people. Men in the lead.

403
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:47,933
All right, let's do it.
Let's go. I'll play around.

404
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:50,280
- On the case.
- I'll play around, here.

405
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:51,730
Get this going.

406
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,766
- Billie Jean gonna go down.
- I remember how to do this.

407
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,941
Oh, yeah.
Dominic is on fire.

408
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:59,254
Winning does
make you feel good.
I haven't won in a while.

409
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:00,497
Wait a second.

410
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,879
Winning is all.
Chiang Kai-shek,
remember that.

411
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:05,260
This is it.
This is how
it should be.

412
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:08,505
Friendship is as important
as romantic love,
remember that.

413
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,129
The cards are life.
Minnesota Fats,
remember that.

414
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,030
It's all in the sauce.

415
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:20,034
Listen, Raph, here it is.
I've got pages man, exciting
stuff. This is what
happens, okay?

416
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:22,830
Our girl, she's running
from everything, you know?

417
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:26,834
Her family, society, the status
quo's, all getting ripped out.

418
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:31,562
She's found a new life with
this cult, and I'll tell you
this much. It is beautiful
and I am wide open to it.

419
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:34,565
- Now what do you think?

420
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,568
I'm out.

421
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:40,019
I won.

422
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:45,542
You're mine.
You're mine.

423
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:52,549
Hey, hey, watch out.
Okay, come on you two,
let's do it.

424
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:21,233
Don't be
a sap, Renee.

425
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:25,168
You dummy up
on me now, you're
looking at 99 years
in Cincy.

426
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:28,240
Where'd you stash
the dame?

427
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:29,620
I'm not telling you
where she is.

428
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:34,211
I don't see that you have
much of a choice, bucko.

429
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,179
You wouldn't understand.

430
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,939
Try me.

431
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:43,980
She told me about
the light.

432
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:48,156
- I'm not talking
about a street lamp.
- Yeah.

433
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:54,714
A light? You getting
sucked into her cult.

434
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:57,683
I'll be lookin'
for you next.

435
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:01,342
- You may not find me.
- Wonderful, wonderful!

436
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,276
- Wonderful scenes you've
written. I love it
- It's good right?

437
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:09,005
I can't see him right now.
You gotta... You gotta stall
him. Make him go away.

438
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,696
Something! Okay?

439
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:19,429
Yo, dude! What's up, man?
Come down!

440
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeah, I'll be right down.

441
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,847
How you gonna act, man?

442
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,712
- I dunno.
- Oh, cool.

443
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:29,128
- What does Gigi want?
- She wants me to be cool.

444
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:31,303
Cool, man,
so just stay here,
cool spirit.

445
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:36,653
Smoke this, dude.
Chill out, when you're done
you go inside. Cool?

446
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,689
Yeah, okay, you
want me to stay here?

447
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:40,968
Yeah, stay here,
I gotta piss.

448
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,594
- Wait...
- Dude I gotta piss!

449
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:16,037
Gigi!

450
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,939
Gigi!

451
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:28,912
Hey, killer.

452
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,397
Look who it is. Holy shit.

453
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:34,228
I didn't know you were going
to fucking be here. What're
you doing?

454
00:32:34,262 --> 00:32:36,609
I'm up here with Dominic,
yeah, I'm writing with Dom.

455
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:38,094
- Work.
- Yeah, work.

456
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:42,063
- You still acting?
- Yeah, I still got the curse.

457
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:46,343
Well, you still look like
a movie star. You get
botox yet?

458
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,417
These are new.
Saw Dom on
Law and Order.

459
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:55,352
Got his ear cut off.
He was being such
a pussy about it.

460
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:57,009
You still working
at the bar?

461
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:59,839
Yeah, I'm still working
at the bar.

462
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:05,845
I gotta take care of some stuff
with G, so, um... maybe we
have a barbecue later.

463
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,985
Yeah?

464
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,885
She mentioned
you guys had
a little blow off.

465
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:21,723
She did?

466
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:24,036
You know,
just in passing.

467
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:28,075
Thought maybe you'd
wanna go get some flowers,

468
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,594
bring them up there,
Clark Gable style.

469
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:33,011
Oh, is that
what you think?

470
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:36,911
Well, all we have up
here is flowers.

471
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,948
I guess I'm
the flowers.

472
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,227
Yeah, I'm
just saying.

473
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,194
- She's still in bed.
- She's in bed?

474
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:48,405
You know that? You know
that she's in bed? How do
you know that she's in bed?

475
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:58,967
How do you know
she's still in bed?

476
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:03,006
You got a lotta
information.

477
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:08,080
Just up here riding with Dom,
you know?

478
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,357
You said that.

479
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:22,612
- Runs good, don't it.
- Yeah.

480
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:26,064
Hey, man, you haven't
changed a bit. Look out!

481
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:36,108
G. Hey, G.

482
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,352
G?

483
00:34:56,473 --> 00:35:01,340
- Hey, man, nice haircut, dude.
Like the way you're wearing it.
- Thanks, man, thanks.

484
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,929
You know, what's going on?
I thought you were driving
to L.A?

485
00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:06,725
Dude, so did I. We got
to Ohio and Wayne
pulled a 180.

486
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:10,453
- Wants to work it out with Gigi
- How long you gonna stay,
you think?

487
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,455
Dude, I dunno. Could be a while.

488
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:16,183
Hey can you do me a favor?
There's a black bag in there,
it's Wayne's. Can you grab it?

489
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:19,600
- Just in the back, dude.
- Yeah, no I got it.

490
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,672
- What is this?
- Oh, bro, that's my
head shot man.

491
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:26,607
- What do you
need a head shot for?
- Oh, it's for my show.

492
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:28,195
What show?

493
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:31,474
You didn't hear it, dude?
I got my own show.
Wayne's such a dick!

494
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:35,029
- I don't get it.
- Dude, I don't get
it either, bro.

495
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:38,791
I'm just teaching my class
at Point Pleasant one day,
surfing

496
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:41,139
It's like the best
day of my life
everyday.

497
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,244
Then getting changed
on the beach, right?

498
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:47,386
This guy comes up to me.
He's like "Hey, bro, I've been
watching you."

499
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:51,701
And I'm like "Hey, bro,
what the fuck, man?"
Because I thought he was
trying to pick me up, dude.

500
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,185
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

501
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,223
Happens that this guy works
for Jerry Bruckenheimer dude.

502
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:59,191
- Jerry Bruckheimer?
- Jerry Bruck-heemer.

503
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,469
- Bruckheimer.
- Yeah, dude,
he did Armageddon.

504
00:36:01,504 --> 00:36:03,954
He does The Amazing Race,
all these huge things!

505
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:06,302
- Jerr...Jerry Bruckheimer.
- Jerry Bruckheimer, yeah, dude!

506
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:08,718
He called me on my cellphone,
I pick up. I'm like "Hello"...

507
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:12,756
I'm like "Okay, dude, yeah,
go fuck yourself'", because I
thought it was Vasper calling.

508
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,552
Dude, it was really Jerry
Bruckheimer, he called
me up, he was like

509
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:18,452
"Hey, man, I want you
to come in, I want to
talk about your show."

510
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:21,731
So I go in and sit
down with him, dude.
You know what?

511
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,768
Great guy, man,
he's wearing
these tight jeans,
he's kinda staring.

512
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:28,255
He's got these beady
eyes, so I'm like
"Hey man", you know?

513
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:31,361
"Is everything cool here?"
and he's like "Yeah,
everything is cool here."

514
00:36:31,396 --> 00:36:37,264
- So then, we start talking
and we just get each other dude.
- Yeah.

515
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:40,232
He's like my other brother
from another mother, dude.

516
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,924
We're just mano e mano,
really vibing out,

517
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:46,687
and then he turns to me
he's like "You're my guy."

518
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:50,380
- Guy for what?
- Dude, for my show I just
told you about!

519
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:53,245
It's a reality show about
my life, bro, I'm gonna teach

520
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,799
guest celebrities how to surf
and they're gonna compete.

521
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:59,182
Dude, it's like Dancing
With the Stars. I mean
meets The It Factor,

522
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,011
meets, like, American Idol,

523
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:03,013
meets, like, we're gonna party.

524
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:06,638
- Sick!
- How much is he paying
you for this?

525
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:10,262
Dude, can't tell ya.
Signed a confidentiality
agreement.

526
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:14,024
- It's a lot of money, dude.

527
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:18,374
Hey, man, dude
hang on a sec, man.

528
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:21,480
My new agents are working out
the contract, fucking UTA.

529
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:25,622
- Ooda?
- Yeah, dude, United
Talent Agency.

530
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:28,901
- U-T-A?
- Yeah I call 'em "Uta"
to fuck with them.

531
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:32,698
UTA, man,
that's top ten.

532
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:39,567
- Hey man, what are you up to,
dude? What're you doing here?
- I'm just, you know man...

533
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:43,053
- I was, uh...
- Wayne said you were
on L.A Law.

534
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:45,815
You got your ear
cut off or something?

535
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,713
That was a while
ago, but, yeah.

536
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:50,164
That's great news,
that's awesome news.

537
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:53,167
Awesome. The door's that way.

538
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:56,998
Look at all the chimes, man!
Everywhere, just chimes.

539
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:00,347
Okay, man, I'll see
you inside.

540
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:10,253
G. G, wait, G!
God dammit!

541
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,497
- Gigi just pull out?
- She did.

542
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:15,223
- What she do that for?
Did she know I was here?
- I don't know.

543
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:20,367
- Come inside. Ah. Ow, Wayne!
- I'm here.

544
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:23,197
Aah, fuck.

545
00:38:25,544 --> 00:38:29,203
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right. Um...

546
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:33,241
I really don't know if she
knew you were here.

547
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:36,072
I'm sorry, man, I didn't mean
to do that. I was just...

548
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:39,903
- It's good, see, I'm cool.
- You okay?

549
00:38:39,938 --> 00:38:42,354
I'm okay, yeah.
What about you?
You okay?

550
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,254
Yeah, man, I'm good,
man, I'm good.

551
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:49,672
- That's good.
- You know...

552
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:52,537
Gigi hasn't been picking up
my calls for a few days, so...

553
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:57,818
- But I'm good, you know.
- You guys gonna...

554
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:01,373
- have it out or something?
I mean...
- Absolutely not.

555
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:04,894
Negative.

556
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,104
- Because I'm up here--
- Is she gonna break
up with me?

557
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:15,491
Wayne, I dunno what
she's gonna do. I
really don't know.

558
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:17,941
It's just, I'm up here,
I'm trying to work

559
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:19,667
Yeah, that's what
Raph said.

560
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,843
You guys are
working up here.

561
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:26,122
I didn't know you
were gonna be up here
you know, so it was a
little bit of a surprise.

562
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:30,437
- Well, I told G, you know.
- What are you guys doing
here, what's Raph doing here?

563
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:34,095
He's writing a script
with me. We're trying
to write a screenplay.

564
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,547
About what?

565
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:42,207
It's about some
fucked up, you know,
like some noir stuff. Some...

566
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:45,693
- missing people, and things--
- That's cool, man, I'm not
gonna get in the way.

567
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:49,456
I just wanted to see G man.
I don't know if she's been
picking up my calls...

568
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,425
But I'm here to make it cool,
you know. It's cool, I mean
is she cool? You think
she's cool?

569
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,255
- What do you think?
- You think she's
being uncool?

570
00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:01,399
- I'm asking you a question.
Can you focus?
- Okay.

571
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:05,506
I'm saying that
I'm cool, and I'm
wondering if she's cool.

572
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:09,199
- Is she cool?
- She's gonna come back.

573
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:11,478
I'm just asking
if she's cool.

574
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:13,756
She's been normal.

575
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,518
Are you not hearing what
I'm saying? I'm just asking
is she cool.

576
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:20,176
I dunno, I mean,
I'm not sure what
we're talking about.

577
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:22,592
Don't worry
about it.

578
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,288
Where's my bag?

579
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:32,084
- Huh?
- Where's my bag?

580
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:36,434
I dunno... Maybe...

581
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:41,197
- Maybe that's it there.
- What's it doing over there?

582
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:47,065
- What's it doing over here?
- I have no idea.

583
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,517
Hey, man, I'm really
sorry about that. I didn't
mean to...You okay?

584
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,173
Yeah, I'm good.

585
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:02,494
All right, see you
later, Wayne.

586
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,781
It's just we're
being pushed out!

587
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:17,475
- It's a reality surfer
show, so what?
- So what?

588
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,304
It starts with
a stupid
surfer show,

589
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:23,688
or Idol, Top Model,
then your Jennifer Hudson
winning a fucking oscar!

590
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:24,896
Do you wanna work?

591
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,831
- But you act like
you don't care!
- I don't care?

592
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:33,801
I don't know, just...
What are we missing?
What?

593
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:37,909
- Maybe, Devon...maybe
he just has 'it'.
- Definitely has 'Id'.

594
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:41,533
- So you agree, he has 'it'?
- He's a beach bum,
he's a pleasure seeker.

595
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:43,570
What does that have
to do with having 'it'?

596
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:45,054
Having 'it'?

597
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,194
- That's what the fuck
I'm talking about!
- Thought you meant 'Id'.

598
00:41:47,228 --> 00:41:51,267
Do you think he has
that something special?
Jesus Christ, Raph.

599
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,097
I wouldn't go so far
as to say Endless Summer,

600
00:41:54,132 --> 00:41:56,410
has 'it', whatever
that is exactly.

601
00:41:56,444 --> 00:42:01,139
Maybe people are seeing
something in him, that they
just don't see in us, and that
something is 'it'.

602
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:04,522
- I don't know what
you're talking about.
- He's on TV, we're not!

603
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,696
He's got a big
agent, we don't.

604
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:09,768
I bet you, in a year,
he's doing a war film
with Ed Harris,

605
00:42:09,803 --> 00:42:14,393
and you and I are still
shaking Cosmos in Brooklyn,
talking about Bertolt Brecht.

606
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:22,091
I'm not gonna change my
philosophy for living
because Devon got
a reality TV show.

607
00:42:24,162 --> 00:42:29,892
Come on! Okay, so what
is this so called philosophy
for living, Raph?

608
00:42:29,926 --> 00:42:32,515
Because the last I looked,
you were a 40 year old
bartender.

609
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,586
I don't give
a motherfuck
about Idol!

610
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:37,140
I don't give
a motherfuck
about Jennifer Hudson,

611
00:42:37,175 --> 00:42:39,660
surfing, 'it',
or whatever
you're talking about!

612
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:41,524
Now I wanna end
this conversation.

613
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,561
Either you're doing
something wrong,

614
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:49,567
or you're doing everything
right. That could mean that
you just don't have 'it'.

615
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:54,572
If you have talent,
if you have real talent,
you don't question it,

616
00:42:54,606 --> 00:43:00,957
and people that constantly
question it, are the mediocre
ones, and that's what you are.
Mediocre.

617
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:06,411
Is that how you
really feel about me?

618
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,281
I mean, is that
how you really feel?

619
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:16,801
- You're doing it right now!
- What? I'm doing what?

620
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:18,250
You're begging approval.

621
00:43:18,285 --> 00:43:22,392
You have this pathetic need
for validation, look at you.
Even from me.

622
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:25,706
Even from me,
the 40 year
old bartender.

623
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,053
Well, at least I'm
putting myself
out there.

624
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:33,956
At least I'm going for
something. You know what,
that takes courage.
You're doing nothing!

625
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,616
You've become a novelty act,
and I'll tell you something,

626
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,551
you're kidding yourself
if you think my sister would
ever have a serious
relationship with you.

627
00:43:45,174 --> 00:43:46,796
You're an entertainment.

628
00:43:48,384 --> 00:43:51,836
No one we know takes
you seriously. No one.

629
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:56,426
You're a fucking joke.

630
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:43,197
Should take a blowtorch
to this fucking place.

631
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:50,066
Dude, there's some chick
out here, bro, it's like
a mirage. She's so fucking
hot, dude.

632
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:55,762
- You know her?
- That's Ava. She used
to work for Gigi.

633
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:58,454
You're not gonna land her
the way you do those
L.A skanks.

634
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,732
Couple of tiki drinks
with some coke.

635
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:02,803
Dude, nobody drinks
tiki drinks.

636
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:06,082
Do you think
I can fuck her, bro?

637
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:16,714
- See all this stuff out here?
See all this?
- Yeah.

638
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:22,927
- It's my stuff. Gigi put
all my stuff out here.
- Wanna bring it back in?

639
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,758
She thinks it's over,
she's wrong.

640
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:31,418
Well, do you think,
there's a chance
it might be?

641
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:33,731
Might be what?

642
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,253
- Over, dude.
- Come here.

643
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:42,463
- What?
- Come here.

644
00:45:42,498 --> 00:45:45,708
- Come on, man. What did I
do, dude?
- Come here.

645
00:45:48,297 --> 00:45:51,921
- Come here.
- What? What are
you doing?

646
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:55,373
- Nothing man.
- Nothing? What are
you doing? Hey.

647
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:56,788
- Hey.
- Hey.

648
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:57,858
- Hey.
- Hey.

649
00:45:57,893 --> 00:46:00,378
- Hey.
- Why?

650
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:04,106
- Why?
- What are you doing, man?
What are you doing, stop.

651
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,626
- What are you prepared to do?
- No, Wayne, don't get yourself
worked up.

652
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:10,319
- Is God big and white?
- Don't get yourself worked up.

653
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:13,184
- Do you believe in the Pope?
- Chill out, stay in the pocket.

654
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:16,394
I'm in the pocket.
You in the pocket?

655
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:20,743
You want the same shit to happen
that happened in the city? You
want that to happen here?

656
00:46:22,193 --> 00:46:23,539
Do you?

657
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:26,645
Do you, man?

658
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,787
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

659
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,134
- I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah, me too, man.

660
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:37,622
Hey, tell me
this. She 18?

661
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:11,414
- Hey.
- Hi.

662
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:13,520
What's happening?

663
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:16,868
- You look nice and comfy.
- I feel comfy.

664
00:47:18,352 --> 00:47:20,803
- You know Wayne?
- I do.

665
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,150
I'm his brother, Devon.

666
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:26,982
- You're Ava.
- I am.

667
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,123
Hey.

668
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:35,300
Welcome to our illustrious
country home, Wayne's
brother, Devon.

669
00:47:40,996 --> 00:47:42,273
I surf.

670
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:46,001
Cool. Professionally?

671
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:51,661
Yeah, but that's not all I do.
I'm a philanthropist. Got my
own clothing line.

672
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:54,526
Devon, Devon!

673
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:57,840
I gotta get in the pocket man.
Gimme your car keys.

674
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,877
Oh, they're in the visor.

675
00:48:05,848 --> 00:48:10,784
He's fine. So, like,
what do you do?

676
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:13,925
What are you
a professional at?

677
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,652
Wayne said you're
en entrepreneur?

678
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:20,104
Did I just see Wayne
drive down the road?

679
00:48:20,138 --> 00:48:22,900
Yeah, he just took a drive
to get his head straight.

680
00:48:27,594 --> 00:48:29,872
- Hi, Dev.
- Hey, G.

681
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,771
Just met Ava.
She's very pretty.

682
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:36,603
You know...

683
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:39,571
Wayne really wants
to work it out with you.

684
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:49,650
- He's trying, you know,
he's really trying.
- He's crazy.

685
00:48:57,106 --> 00:49:00,523
Izzy, I didn't get your
messages. The service
is in and out up here.

686
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:03,975
I had to go to the emergency
animal hospital, all night
with him.

687
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,598
- All night and--
- The service is bad.
If I knew...

688
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:10,395
Of course I would have called
you if I knew Benny hurt his
eye, I mean, what...

689
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:15,228
Just tell me what's...
What happened? Tell me
what happened? Is he okay?

690
00:49:15,262 --> 00:49:19,853
I don't wanna talk to you until you're done writing this screenplay, or whatever it is.

691
00:49:19,887 --> 00:49:23,305
Are you serious? Are you
seriously doing this to me
right now?

692
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:26,273
- Can you put Benny on speaker
phone? I wanna talk to him.
- No, no,, no.

693
00:49:26,308 --> 00:49:30,208
That's ridiculous. I'm not
putting your dog on speaker
phone.

694
00:49:30,243 --> 00:49:33,039
Izz? Izzy,
are you there?

695
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:36,559
- You okay?
- Jesus!

696
00:49:36,594 --> 00:49:41,702
- Devon, you just scared
the shit out of me.
- All right, dude, chill out.

697
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:44,119
We're in a country.
It's illustrious here.

698
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:59,789
- How you doing, babe?
- What the hell?

699
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:04,484
- What happened to you?
- Me and your brother getting
down at the deeper truths.

700
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:06,037
How's it going
with you and Wayne?

701
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:09,696
- I haven't seen him yet.
- Yeah?

702
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:12,733
Well, if you need me,
you shoot up a flare, okay?

703
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:15,046
You still got it!

704
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:18,601
Look, I'm throwing a goddamn
party here tonight, lighting
this place up.

705
00:50:18,636 --> 00:50:24,021
- You got an old suit in that
collection for me?
- A party? Yeah, sure.

706
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:26,230
- I have a suit, of course.
- Okay, good.

707
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:35,204
- You smell that
night jasmine, do you?
- Yeah, I smell it.

708
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:43,178
Be cool, Raph. Okay?
Just be cool.

709
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:59,194
Hold up, broheim.

710
00:50:59,228 --> 00:51:02,335
What's up superstar, I heard
about your show. Congrats.

711
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:05,165
Thanks, friend.
Nice ride.

712
00:51:05,821 --> 00:51:07,892
What do you want, Dev?

713
00:51:07,926 --> 00:51:10,860
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the store.

714
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:13,656
Are you gonna
get something
for Gigi?

715
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:18,213
I'm gonna get something for
everybody you want me to
pick you up a nice Rose
there, Venice?

716
00:51:20,905 --> 00:51:22,389
Your eyes, my eyes.

717
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:28,326
Your eyes, my eyes, bro.
I'm watching you. All day.

718
00:51:38,164 --> 00:51:39,337
Hi.

719
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:41,926
Hi, Devon.

720
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,431
- Hello?
- What're you doing?

721
00:52:05,743 --> 00:52:09,195
I'm thinking.

722
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,409
What's all that noise?

723
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:21,897
- Cooking.
- Mm, what're you cooking?

724
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,420
Everything.

725
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:28,973
- Sauce?
-Yeah.

726
00:52:29,594 --> 00:52:31,148
Polenta?

727
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:33,322
- Mm hm.
- Nice.

728
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,084
Lamb?

729
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,987
- What do you want?
- Come around the corner,
by the pond.

730
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:52,824
Hey, how's the sauce?

731
00:52:54,032 --> 00:52:58,658
- Good. What're those?
- Would you like to have a seat?

732
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:00,280
Where'd you get 'em?
Did you take them?

733
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:03,318
Don't worry about
where I got 'em.
Just sit down, please?

734
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:04,836
I wanna talk.

735
00:53:04,871 --> 00:53:07,977
- Did you take those chairs
from somebody's porch?
- I borrowed them.

736
00:53:08,012 --> 00:53:09,910
Just bring 'em back, Jesus.

737
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:12,499
I thought we could sit down
and talk and be nice. What you
being so uptight about?

738
00:53:12,534 --> 00:53:15,433
- You asked me to marry you!
- How is that a bad thing?

739
00:53:15,468 --> 00:53:16,745
I don't see how this is a bad--

740
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:18,298
How and when you did
it is the bad thing.

741
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:21,267
And then you just took off?
That's a bad thing!

742
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:27,204
- I mean what were you thinking?
- I don't know.

743
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:35,350
My head was fucked up, okay,
but I've been thinking about
this for a long time.

744
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:41,390
- Jesus Christ, Wayne.
- Jesus Christ what? What do you
want from me? I love you.

745
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:43,081
I wanna marry you.

746
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:47,845
Where are you going?
Don't you think I know
what's wrong with me?

747
00:53:47,879 --> 00:53:51,400
Please, come back.
Please, come back here.

748
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:56,371
I got something for you. It's an
anger card, just for you to...
Sit down.

749
00:53:56,405 --> 00:54:01,134
- Babe, sit down.
- Hey, I don't wanna sit.

750
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:06,243
"There's nothing really worth
getting angry about. What're
you angry about this time?"

751
00:54:07,796 --> 00:54:11,834
- Are you asking me this?
I don't get it.
- No that's to myself.

752
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:16,874
I've been carrying that around
for a few weeks now. I write
stuff down that...

753
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:21,568
- Triggers?
- Yeah! More I write it out,
more I can start to see the...

754
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,540
- Patterns?
- Patterns.

755
00:54:27,574 --> 00:54:30,267
And then I can start to figure
some of that shit out.

756
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:34,512
Okay. This is very
evolved for you.

757
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,688
Is this some
kind of trick?

758
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:41,381
What do you think?
No, it's not a trick.

759
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:45,212
Okay, it's a trick.
You're being tricked.

760
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,905
"Lights."

761
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:50,217
Yeah? Okay, I know that one.

762
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:53,807
"Bruni the super?"

763
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:58,122
- Yeah, that fucking guy.
- Well, I know. Me too,
for that matter.

764
00:55:00,262 --> 00:55:01,608
Rain...

765
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,990
Rain gets you mad?

766
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:09,236
No, not the rain. Umbrellas.
People aren't careful you could
get your eye poked out.

767
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:13,793
They could easily lift it up,
or tilt it. They don't fucking
do that.

768
00:55:13,827 --> 00:55:16,209
Get poked with
a fucking umbrella.

769
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:21,041
I don't see anything on here
about the Barracuda.

770
00:55:21,076 --> 00:55:26,012
Are you listening, are you
really reading this? I'm
working my way up
to the big one.

771
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:33,364
Why would you wait till now
to give me this? After you've
caused all these problems...

772
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,508
You do something like this,
and then you propose, that's
reasonable.

773
00:55:39,543 --> 00:55:42,408
But, not on the heels
of a huge argument.

774
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:44,962
And then you--

775
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:48,068
â™ª Did you ever see a dream walking? â™ª

776
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:50,139
â™ª Well, I did

777
00:55:50,174 --> 00:55:54,972
â™ª Did you ever see a dream
talking? â™ª

778
00:55:55,006 --> 00:55:56,629
â™ª Well, I did

779
00:55:56,663 --> 00:56:00,080
â™ª Did you ever see heaven
right in your arms? â™ª

780
00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:02,462
â™ª Saying I love you, I do

781
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:03,774
Stop it!

782
00:56:03,808 --> 00:56:06,017
Well the dream that
was walking, I --

783
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:07,536
That was a little high.

784
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:12,714
- Stop. Stop!

785
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:15,924
I love you--

786
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:19,790
I didn't want you
to leave. I never
want you to leave.

787
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:23,552
But you're always
fucking leaving.

788
00:56:25,658 --> 00:56:29,455
I'm working on it, baby.
What do you think the card's
all about?

789
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:33,251
I don't wanna leave. I don't
want you to leave either.

790
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,705
Let's get married.

791
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,745
- Oh, my God!
- What, oh, my God?

792
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:47,473
I can't believe
you did it again!

793
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:50,579
- What am I doing?
- You're not getting it.

794
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:28,617
Dominic! Hey, it's me, Kaplan. Listen, bad news, the money went away for a little project.

795
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:31,206
So, I won't be
needing your script.

796
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,555
But hey, these things happen, you know, so, you gotta stick it out. The money was there,

797
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:38,558
now it's not. It's very
frustrating, but what can
you do?

798
00:57:38,593 --> 00:57:41,665
Okay, take care, babe.
I gotta go. Bye.

799
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,050
Fuck.

800
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,139
You were crying.
Why were you crying?

801
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:10,176
Because they sliced
my ear off, dude.

802
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,491
But that's not what would
happen. That's blunt trauma.
You would go into shock
or something.

803
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:16,803
You've never had your ear
cut off. How the fuck do
you know?

804
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:19,150
No, but I've been shot.
Got a piece of shrapnel
on my thigh,

805
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:23,120
seen my buddies get their
fingers blown off. That's not
what happens. You go into shock.

806
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:26,261
This guy, it was very close
to my head, man.

807
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:31,335
- It hit nerves and shit.
- What about playing like
an interior decorator?

808
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:35,132
Or maybe like
a hairdresser?

809
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:37,859
Stop it.
Come on, Wayne.

810
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:40,620
- Wanna do a shot?
- Yes.

811
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:51,389
Let's go out.

812
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:22,144
Cheers, bro!

813
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:23,318
Cheers!

814
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:25,147
I want you, right there.
You, give me...

815
00:59:32,016 --> 00:59:33,777
Check, check, check!

816
00:59:33,811 --> 00:59:37,608
DJ Fluxus is gonna juxt your whole position, people.

817
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:39,990
Everyone back down on the dance floor.

818
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,716
Let's do it.

819
01:01:02,313 --> 01:01:08,457
Listen to me, you're
my everything. You're
all that means
anything to me.

820
01:01:08,492 --> 01:01:13,531
You're my ice cream sundae,
you understand. You get me?

821
01:01:15,913 --> 01:01:18,778
Why don't we go
to Niagara Falls and
have a honeymoon?

822
01:01:20,297 --> 01:01:22,264
- Hey.
- Hey.

823
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:27,338
Hi! Those were seriously
some good dance moves.

824
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:30,341
- You too!
- Thanks.

825
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:34,829
Cold water doesn't bother
me. I can keep my hand
in there all night.

826
01:01:34,863 --> 01:01:36,658
Maybe you should
do that.

827
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,769
Ah. No.

828
01:01:45,425 --> 01:01:46,703
Sorry.

829
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:49,533
Whoa, what the fuck?
You're not into this?

830
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,512
- Come here.
- What? Oh.

831
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:20,495
Everybody on the dance
floor. Everybody, come down.

832
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:24,533
We do the honeymoon now,
and if that goes well, we
can get married later.

833
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:26,604
- Know what I mean?
- I like that.

834
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,091
And if we get really crazy,
we could drive to Canada.

835
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,714
Keep on driving
to Montreal.

836
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,752
Is that something you wanna do?
Don't you wanna do that?

837
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:38,547
Do you wanna
do that?

838
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:44,243
What?

839
01:02:44,277 --> 01:02:46,901
Look I'm sorry,
it's just, you know, I...

840
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:48,695
Have a girlfriend.

841
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:53,839
That's not what
I'm talking about.

842
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:02,502
All right,
okay, okay, next.

843
01:03:02,537 --> 01:03:05,436
You know what
the main ingredient
of the marshmallow is?

844
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,300
- Sugar!
- No.

845
01:03:07,335 --> 01:03:09,786
- Horse?
- Cocaine?

846
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,202
- No. What?
- Horse...horse hoof.

847
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:14,031
- Hooves, hooves!
- Oh, my God.

848
01:03:18,725 --> 01:03:22,764
Politics. Politics
people, politics.

849
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,663
All right, last one.
Who's on the 500
dollar bill?

850
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:29,322
William McKinley.
William McKinley.
William McKinley.

851
01:03:29,357 --> 01:03:31,842
- Bitches.
- Who the fuck knows that?

852
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:36,813
No one. That's the point.
William McKinley was a fucking
president of the United States
and no one knows who he is.

853
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:42,749
Everybody knows who Washington
is. Lincoln, fucking Ben
Franklin wasn't even president
and he's on some money.

854
01:03:42,784 --> 01:03:45,614
But what the fuck did
William McKinley do?

855
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:49,066
- He got assassinated.
- He did get assassinated.

856
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,241
- Does anybody know?
- He was President?

857
01:03:51,275 --> 01:03:55,245
- I've never even heard of him.
- They don't even make 500
dollar bills any more.

858
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:57,040
What's your point?

859
01:03:57,074 --> 01:04:01,078
My point is, McKinley
never made his mark.

860
01:04:01,389 --> 01:04:02,873
Oh.

861
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:06,359
- So you're a man on a mission.
- Yeah, I'm a man on a mission.

862
01:04:06,394 --> 01:04:08,637
You know, I wanna
make a mark.

863
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:11,088
What then?

864
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:18,337
I don't know. That's it.
I get to live my life
doing what I love.

865
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:21,996
Again, and again and again,
and again.

866
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:25,482
And then we die,
and then it's over
and who cares?

867
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:27,553
We're all fucking
just bacteria, dude.

868
01:04:31,419 --> 01:04:34,905
Why are you so caught
up in making a mark for?

869
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,598
I wake up every
morning with this...

870
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:44,570
pain in my stomach like I did
something wrong. I don't
wanna feel that shit any more.

871
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:47,849
Shame.

872
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,024
I don't know what
it is but I don't
wanna feel it.

873
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:52,233
Was talking about
self-loathing. Shame.

874
01:04:57,514 --> 01:04:59,619
You gotta look
to it man.

875
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:03,727
Everything else
will come.

876
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:08,214
I don't know...

877
01:05:09,526 --> 01:05:11,597
But you do know.

878
01:05:11,631 --> 01:05:17,879
It's exactly that. The weight
of all this stuff gets lifted
when you embrace love.

879
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,434
All of this other
stuff is real.

880
01:05:21,469 --> 01:05:24,955
But it's good to align
yourself with love.
It helps.

881
01:05:26,784 --> 01:05:29,166
What's the point,
if we don't have love?

882
01:05:29,856 --> 01:05:31,375
Yeah.

883
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,101
Why are we here?

884
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:40,971
Yeah, dude, love.
Riding high energy.
When I surf, I feel love.

885
01:05:41,006 --> 01:05:45,182
A wave is like a wavelength
of energy. It's moving water

886
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:48,841
and I'm riding the surface.
Dude, think about that!

887
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:53,742
I'm in perfect harmony
with mother nature
when I'm surfing.

888
01:05:53,777 --> 01:05:56,607
- That's amazing!
- That is amazing.

889
01:06:00,577 --> 01:06:02,027
I love Gigi.

890
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:05,927
I love Gigi too.

891
01:06:07,446 --> 01:06:09,275
I love you.

892
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,450
Take it easy, tiger.
She loves you too.

893
01:06:11,484 --> 01:06:14,039
I'm serious.

894
01:06:14,073 --> 01:06:19,147
- I love you too.

895
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,772
Love is a giant pickle.

896
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:27,984
I'm in love with you.

897
01:06:30,296 --> 01:06:34,645
These people, they don't know
what we're talking about.
I'm in love with you.

898
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,270
Wayne, I'm sorry you have
to hear this. I got nothing
against you.

899
01:06:43,758 --> 01:06:46,864
There's something alive
here between Gigi and me.

900
01:06:47,865 --> 01:06:49,626
Right.

901
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:54,838
Remember back in the day,
you wanted to drive down
the Pan-American highway
with me?

902
01:06:55,494 --> 01:06:57,875
Remember that?

903
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:01,051
You wanted to drive
all the way down
there with me?

904
01:07:02,777 --> 01:07:04,296
But I wasn't ready.

905
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:10,681
- These last few days
have been so--
- Let's hear him out.

906
01:07:13,305 --> 01:07:18,586
Gigi, I can love you
like you never, ever,
ever...

907
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:24,730
Like earth, like magic.
Just meet me in my car
at 4:00 a.m..

908
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:28,975
You don't bring anything.
We gonna make that drive.

909
01:08:09,188 --> 01:08:11,190
Hey, Dev, you're
in the wrong car.

910
01:08:18,508 --> 01:08:19,819
Sorry.

911
01:08:24,548 --> 01:08:25,618
Good night.

912
01:09:41,004 --> 01:09:42,557
What's up big boy?

913
01:10:13,174 --> 01:10:15,383
You know, I like
what you guys have
written so far.

914
01:10:16,695 --> 01:10:18,110
Yeah, what do you
like about it?

915
01:10:19,974 --> 01:10:22,045
I like that they
fall in love.

916
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,878
Does she fall through
with the double cross?

917
01:10:27,913 --> 01:10:30,156
Because that would be
heart breaking.

918
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:33,470
Would.

919
01:11:29,906 --> 01:11:32,667
Think she goes through
with the double cross?

920
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:34,704
I absolutely do.
