1
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,297
<i>Ooh yeah</i>

2
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,749
Oh shit. Hey man, I gotta get to
Brooklyn, I gotta get to work,

3
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,519
open the bar, I gotta work on
this audition for the morning.

4
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,120
What're you going in on?

5
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,490
Now is this scene before or
after you saw your own leg off?

6
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,293
I've seen slaves breaking their
backs in the fields. Have you?

7
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:07,802
Pardon me, pardon me, I'm very sorry. No, we
should head out. We gotta be there at four.

8
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:13,507
That's enough, from both of you.
And you... wait. That's enough.

9
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,140
We need you up there, kid.

10
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,479
I'll be right up.

11
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,017
Brother, prepping an audition or doing an
audition, or resting from an audition.

12
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,329
You can never commit,
because you never know,

13
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,588
you might get a job,
but you never do get a job.

14
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,988
Sorry, but you don't.

15
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,396
Okay, who needs what?

16
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,599
These three here,
we need two Ripostos one Fellini.

17
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,470
I don't know what he wants, and that
freak down there, I'm not certain.

18
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,606
Oh shit, is that Raphael?

19
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,076
I was a gay on the Woody Allen movie you did.

20
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,212
I'm gonna be right with you. Just kidding.

21
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,133
I knew you had a small part
but you were great.

22
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,916
Thought you were
gonna be huge!

23
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,182
What happened?

24
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,761
When I headed for that door I realized

25
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,895
if I went out, I would never come back.

26
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,100
I didn't want to never come back

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,939
but I couldn't come back out
onto the stage, so

28
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,840
there wasn't anything left
so I went up the ladder.

29
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,148
You're The King.
The King. You're Joe Strummer.

30
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,283
- I'm Joe Strummer.
- You're a sonic producer.

31
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,619
I'm a sonic producer!

32
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,891
I think I liked it. If you don't mind
I wanna sit for the second scene.

33
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,827
Sure, no.
What you did, really good.

34
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:44,098
Really good.
Very good, thanks.

35
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,038
<i>I don't know what else to tell you.
You're in an age void.</i>

36
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,037
Would you like a Peroni?

37
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,473
I want you to change your attitude, chief.

38
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:56,475
I want you to ask me again,
and this time, with a smile.

39
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,050
Go fuck yourself!
Get the fuck out!

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,888
Yeah, we will get the fuck out of here!

41
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,008
Look at me, look at me.

42
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:11,788
Dude I can't do this anymore.
I'm gonna fucking kill someone.

43
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,104
- In an age void.
- What?

44
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,272
They don't know what to do with me.
That's the problem.

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,275
Look, it's Lincoln Center.
It's a cultural superstore.

46
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:33,180
It's white boy business, I mean, you
getting that part is a long shot, come on!

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,816
Well what's the point then, Raph?

48
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,486
Please, tell me,
I mean it's the same five directors,

49
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,888
the same 10 writers, the same 20 actors,

50
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,159
they just do everything! It's not good
for theaters, it's fucking boring.

51
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,628
Look, it's a tight circle,
we're not part of it.

52
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,932
You know the days of Joe Papp, off the
street, the living theater, that's done!

53
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,368
Who's off the street?
I'm trained, well trained.

54
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,504
- I know you're trained.
- I went to conservatory!

55
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,607
Yeah but you didn't go to Juilliard, and
that's what this is all about, right?

56
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,703
What big shows you were in,
who saw you do it,

57
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,644
my dad is Edward Albee,
all that kind of stuff.

58
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,279
- Edward Albee doesn't have kids.
- I know.

59
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,248
- He's gay.
- Doesn't mean he doesn't have kids.

60
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,817
- But he doesn't.
- Hey, Dom! Who's this, your pimp?

61
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,118
Hey, how you doing, what a sight!

62
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,355
You look fantastic. Look who
it is, Kaplan!

63
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,591
Hey don't mind us.
We were running a scene right now...

64
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:22,196
I can't believe I'm running into you maniacs,
you guys have been on my mind all week!

65
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,031
- Was it in a naughty way?
- Take it easy.

66
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,000
It's always a little naughty
with you, Raphael.

67
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,035
Tell us the less naughty parts for now.

68
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,538
All right. That was an amazing
night at your bar last month.

69
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,407
We've had so many amazing nights
at the bar with you, Kaplan.

70
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,043
No, we were talking movies with
your writer friend, Jonathan.

71
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,712
- You had those leather pants on!
- We love those pants.

72
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:42,917
Wasn't Jonathan talking about doing some low
budget Raymond Chandler detective story thing?

73
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,486
- No.
- That was our idea.

74
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,821
Who was mentioning the <i>Sweet Smell of Success?</i>

75
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,490
- "Match me, Sidney"
- Match me.

76
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,770
I love that movie.

77
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:53,294
What's Jonathan up to?
I love his show.

78
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,263
Can you get me in touch? I promised my
boss I'd find something interesting

79
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,998
for him to produce for under 300 grand,

80
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,467
he's looking to shuffle some money
around on a tax credit thing.

81
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,638
I don't know what Jonathan' up
to, but we wrote that script.

82
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,707
- It's written, it's done.
- What script?

83
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,108
The Raymond Chandler thing.

84
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,611
We're burning down the
cultural superstar rasta.

85
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:15,082
Wow, look at you guys, that's great.
Did you write parts for yourselves?

86
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,583
- Of course.
- Yeah, we're the leads. We play brothers.

87
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,979
Okay, well what's it about?

88
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,827
Don't be shy, Dominic.
Tell Kaplan what it's about.

89
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,763
It's, uh, well, basically, um...

90
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,497
- Well, we play brothers.
- Yeah, I got that.

91
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,904
And, you know, we own a detective agency.

92
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,673
- And it's a noir.
- Absolutely.

93
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,209
Uh, you know, basically...

94
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:47,815
Well, it's an elevated genre film. At least
that's how aunt Carrie described it.

95
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,451
- Aunt Carrie read it?
- Yeah, she loved it.

96
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,786
How the hell did you get
aunt Carrie to read it?

97
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,388
- No offense.
- None taken.

98
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,091
- We know some people.
- Yeah, we're tapped in.

99
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,993
Well, what'd she say?

100
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,095
She said, what did she say, Raph?

101
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,130
- Said it was raw.
- Yeah, oh yeah.

102
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,033
She said it was really raw and original,

103
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,569
and that she'd love to get her hands on it.

104
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,537
It's called "The Blackmailers Don't Shoot."

105
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,773
- Or maybe "The Black Mask."
- Yeah, I like that one.

106
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,810
What the fuck, is it low budget? You guys
think you can make it for under 300 k?

107
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,480
- Oh, yeah.
- Super low. Really low.

108
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,415
- Less than that.
- This sounds perfect.

109
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:26,053
My boss is looking for something new.
I get to produce this project.

110
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,788
Show me the script, let's do this.

111
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,191
No wait, hold on a minute, you know...

112
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,460
We're doing rewrites,
we're swamped, you know, we can't.

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,797
This money goes away in two weeks, we don't
have to jump through any hoops with them.

114
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,700
- I just need to see the script.
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,835
Look I get you guys, I always have.

116
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:46,907
I can give you ten days, that's it. But we're
meeting with other writers, so get it to me.

117
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,444
How you gonna get out of this.
We don't even know aunt Carrie.

118
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,144
I auditioned for her once.

119
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,650
- You can't write a script in ten days.
- Yes, but we can.

120
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,252
We, together.

121
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,689
Come on, we've been
talking about doing this for years.

122
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,890
I have an idea.
What do writers do?

123
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,860
They go to the country.

124
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,399
We'll go to the country. To my sister's house.
We'll have it all to ourselves.

125
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:16,403
Peace, quiet, no distractions...

126
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,805
Let's just get there, get down, and do it.

127
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,464
Photosynthesis baby.

128
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,469
Oh, I forgot how
peaceful it is in the country.

129
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,241
Nature will flip you, Dominic.

130
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,279
Flip you for real, remember that.

131
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,486
Yeah!

132
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,271
Police activity,
people. stay back.

133
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,739
- Dominic, grab the bags.
- Oh, yeah.

134
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,881
That's very cute.
Very cute.

135
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,286
<i>To Gigi's country manor.</i>

136
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,700
Starting tomorrow,
I think we should cleanse it out.

137
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,294
No booze.

138
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,529
I saw this documentary on Ingmar Bergman

139
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,565
- at the Film Forum.
- I love the Film Forum.

140
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:28,202
He said the demons want you to
stay in bed with cold feet.

141
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:33,238
So the first thing he does is he gets up
in the morning and he takes a walk.

142
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,607
And then he writes.

143
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,985
You want some gross character of a woman!

144
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,455
That means power makes you more masculine,
and masculine means you're ugly.

145
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,458
Well shame on you, you macho shithead!

146
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,460
All right, fuck this.
Eureka!

147
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,364
Yes, that's it!
It's a simple missing persons case.

148
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,965
Gets more evolved when we find the girl.

149
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,403
- Recognize!
- It's a character piece,

150
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,005
- masked as a noir,
- Wonderful.

151
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,139
Wonderful, wonderful!

152
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,841
Maybe a dubonnet with a twist.

153
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,142
It's a secret!

154
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,044
Corruption that echoes the
world in which they live.

155
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,612
Yes, uh, dark shame.

156
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,721
It could be a double cross.

157
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,055
Could be, a double cross.

158
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,722
- Genius!
- Yeah!

159
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,989
<i>Maybe she joins a group,
a cult, like the Source Family.</i>

160
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,661
A cult could be fun.

161
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:01,728
It's a period piece,
but maybe we make it a mash up.

162
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,531
Set in Los Angeles over a 24 hour sequence.

163
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,700
Some dialog, dancing but heavy,

164
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,368
like <i>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.</i>

165
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,237
- I love that movie.
- Okay, so, dancing...

166
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,374
- In a noir.
- Yep.

167
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:18,877
That's good, right,
we haven't seen that! That's good.

168
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,813
Okay, so, she...

169
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,582
Who's... who's that?

170
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,456
That's what I wanna know.

171
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,711
- Hello.
- Hi.

172
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,312
How you doing?

173
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,882
- You must be Dominic.
- How do you know who I am?

174
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,118
I've seen pictures of you.

175
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,455
Er... Where?

176
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,592
In Gigi's store. I used
to work there, I'm Ava.

177
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,795
Oh, yeah. How is it
we've never met?

178
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,598
- I guess we've just never seen each other.
- You don't look like an Ava.

179
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,015
What does an Ava look like.

180
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,189
You change your name?

181
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,136
Let me see your ID.
Got your passport?

182
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,272
Some outfit you have on. Is your
name Lawrence by any chance?

183
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,608
Of Arabia? Close,
Raphael, of Brooklyn.

184
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,677
You wanna borrow this?
I got this one in Marrakesh,

185
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,546
Okay, Ava, Ava, here's the, um...

186
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:30,448
Raphael, Brooklyn and I,
we really need to be alone.

187
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,650
So, um...

188
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,388
What you doing here?

189
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,823
Planting flowers.
I'm doing Gigi a favor.

190
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,526
My friend Carl is going to do a
shoot here in a couple of weeks.

191
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,428
Okay, Gigi, she didn't tell me
anything about this.

192
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,917
Don't worry about it.
We're the king of this castle.

193
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:44,765
Something wrong?

194
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,234
Here's the thing, Ava.
We're up here to write.

195
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,238
- We've been contracted to write a screenplay.
- We have nine days to finish.

196
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:55,108
I'll be very quiet.
Like a mouse.

197
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,477
Like a mouse.

198
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,112
I'm staying out in the trailer.

199
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,881
Well, why you doing that?

200
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:05,116
- Why not?
- Okay, see. I just wanna set the right tone.

201
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,752
The tone is set.

202
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,063
Now look.

203
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,664
That girl is very hot.

204
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,233
- I can see that.
- Just stay calm.

205
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,602
I can't control the bitches worldwide.

206
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,739
Yeah, okay, this...
This is gonna be a problem.

207
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,608
- It's probably Karl Lagerfeld.
- What?

208
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,445
Why are we whispering?

209
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,654
What, what?

210
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:35,882
Her friend who's gonna
shoot here in a couple of weeks.

211
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,524
It's probably Karl Lagerfeld,
the famous designer.

212
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,986
Yes, I know who he is, bitch.

213
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,425
What are you guys whispering about?

214
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,969
Ingmar Bergman.

215
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,843
I told you.

216
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,778
We don't trust something about her, correct?

217
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,214
We don't trust something
about anyone. We're detectives.

218
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,582
Why hasn't she
gone to the police?

219
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,083
She wants to keep it
out of the paper.

220
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,686
Wants to use discretion doesn't
want anything to go on record.

221
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,021
She's got an aversion to celebrity culture.

222
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,923
Are you guys going somewhere?

223
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:17,991
- Yeah.
- No.

224
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,559
Why?

225
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,630
You're sitting in your car. I was hoping
you could give me a lift to the store.

226
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,533
- We can't.
- Absolutely. Why not?

227
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,603
Okay, I'm gonna walk then.
Do you guys need anything?

228
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,640
- No, no thank you. We're cool.
- Do you want some Red Bull?

229
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,176
- Are you kidding?
- For the writing.

230
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,042
No we're keeping it clean.

231
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,813
Okay.

232
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,045
Bye.

233
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:50,223
Ava, can you get me some bittersweet
chocolate, some vanilla ice cream,

234
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,592
some cookies and maybe some beef jerky.

235
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,563
- Don't go crazy. Just get one or the other.
- Worry about yourself, damn!

236
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,865
Ava!

237
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,967
Just make it vanilla swiss almond!

238
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,338
- Okay.
- And some condoms.

239
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,075
- I think you should fuck her.
- I'm absolutely not going to fuck her!

240
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,178
- It'll open you wide up.
- I'm here to write.

241
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,118
- I'm writing!
- You can do both.

242
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,016
- Are you drinking a Red Bull?
- It's Prosecco.

243
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:23,121
That's Red Bull.
Why would you drink that?

244
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,139
You wanna work all night?

245
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,494
You wanna be a big time writer?

246
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,963
Try something before you dismiss it!

247
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,798
Put down the hand sanitizer
and get a little messy.

248
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,041
Gonna feel like a tarantula.

249
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,181
What the fuck was that?

250
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,298
Gigi!

251
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,606
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
Are you okay? Are you all right?

252
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,642
Gigi, what're you...
Have you been drinking?

253
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,309
Have you...
You're wasted!

254
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,413
Gi...

255
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,049
Raphael!
Raphael.

256
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,516
- Raphael.
- Gigi!

257
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,029
What are you doing for fun these days?

258
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,799
I don't know, stranger, what have
you been doing for fun these days.

259
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,802
Think we owe each other
about three happy new years.

260
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,273
- She drove here drunk.
- Oh, give it a rest!

261
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,510
I didn't drive anywhere. I stopped
for a second or something.

262
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,346
Can't you see she needs
taking care of, Dominic?

263
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,782
Aw you!
You are in tune.

264
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,985
You simply tune in.
You always have.

265
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,618
Gigi!

266
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,860
My little darling!

267
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,129
Bring 'em more water please. The
last thing I want... Okay, wow.

268
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,836
Splish, splash, I feel fantastic!

269
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,971
Dom, you wanna get in there
and make it a family affair?

270
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,744
I'm so happy we're all
here. It's wide open.

271
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,745
You guys have known
each other a while, right?

272
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:27,280
Yeah.

273
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,751
- Raphael was her boyfriend, sort of.
- What do you mean, sort of?

274
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,054
Whatever they were.
That was way back.

275
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,055
Hey!

276
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:39,624
Yes, it's true. Raph was
my boyfriend, sort of.

277
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,218
Speaking of, where's Wayne?

278
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,499
Don't mention Wayne, no no,
don't mention Wayne.

279
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,067
Why not, why?
What happened now?

280
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,774
He has some nerve.
That's all I'll say.

281
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,677
Raph and I have a lotta work
to do tonight so we might have...

282
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,180
Not a bubble bath without some bubbly.

283
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,982
Yes!

284
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:07,053
- Please man.
- Why are you people ruining my life?

285
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,990
Because I love it when
a man brings me champagne!

286
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,091
The honey is flowing in all directions!

287
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,606
Yeah, get up. Let's go. We're leaving.

288
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,258
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

289
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,895
- Why?
- Why do you think?

290
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,106
Dominic. Dominic!

291
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,308
- What?
- I was losing my mind!

292
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:07,013
You can't leave, I practically crashed the car
into the house last night. I drove drunk.

293
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,780
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time.

294
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,521
Get off!

295
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,265
I don't wanna be alone right now.

296
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,331
Well I do!

297
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,972
- G, stop it.
- Why can't you stay?

298
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,677
- Because, I need to focus!
- So focus!

299
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,810
It's a really big house.

300
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:46,319
- Do you like that?
- I need you! I might be at the end of a rope.

301
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,586
Fine, all right, I'll stay!

302
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,322
Savage!

303
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,535
- Gorilla.
- Pussy!

304
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,509
What's up with my brother,
what are you feeding him?

305
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,176
Roast turkey and Miles Davis of course.

306
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,870
Had a dream about you last night, G.

307
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,389
That sounds promising.

308
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,828
You were telling me you wanted to
sell your shadow for 60 dollars.

309
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,138
- I could get more than 60 bucks.
- I bet you could.

310
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,471
Hey would you mind reading this with me?

311
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,650
I'm tired of my shadow
pinpointing exactly where I am.

312
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,886
I'm not sure that I follow.

313
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,518
I want to be rid of it.

314
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,622
It's not that simple, lady.

315
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,759
Neither am I.

316
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,328
There's no turning back, you understand?

317
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,868
Someone else could find a better use for it.

318
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,831
It got a little complicated...

319
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,273
Missed you.

320
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:17,443
Change of plans.
We're not leaving.

321
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:22,615
So, upstairs in five,
back to work. Is this hot?

322
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:27,287
G, just so you know, you fucked up
my rib, really bad. It's killing me.

323
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:31,422
- Let's go. Back to work.
- So...

324
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,664
...you write and then you dream,
or you dream and then you write?

325
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,367
- Which comes first?
- I dunno, that's a good question.

326
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,402
Sometimes I think the dream is writing me.

327
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,181
So if we find her,
why don't we bring her back?

328
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,551
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

329
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,420
Because if we bring her back, the movie ends.

330
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,156
I'm not so sure about that,
I'm not sure at all.

331
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,024
What's so special about this cult?

332
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,738
Primary colors,
Stanley the dog, abandoned peers.

333
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,097
Keep that close,
abandoned peers.

334
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:15,568
Trans-cranial
magnetic stimulation.

335
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,337
Grapefruit the size of cannonballs.

336
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:22,809
The realism of nature combined with the
serial-ism of nature, aka, whimsy. Aha!

337
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,277
What?

338
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:29,949
Carlos Puyol beats Real Madrid with his head.
With his head!

339
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,704
Raph, Raph, Raph. What?
Okay, what is all that?

340
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:34,320
Where you going
with all this?

341
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,457
You see how quickly
young Ava dropped her robe?

342
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,926
You gotta love a girl who can
think on her feet, huh?

343
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,296
If you're a man with sight, you'll
notice she had a little fur down there.

344
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,899
I've been wondering for some time now if
the kids have been bringing bush back.

345
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,902
<i>Kojak</i> has been ruling
the area for a long time now.

346
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,939
Back in the day,
your sister had a full on Joan Baez.

347
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,574
- Okay, stop, stop. Please, stop!
- What? What?

348
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,812
These are my notes.

349
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,981
These are things that can spark my vision.

350
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,684
We have to stick with it to get somewhere.

351
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:09,756
I need to circle the muse. I need to let
the character emerge. I'm not a machine!

352
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,405
You need to circle.

353
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,160
You seem to circle
a lotta things.

354
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,496
Oh, I see what's happening here.

355
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,532
I'm just saying man,
sometimes, you gotta push.

356
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:24,203
Man, you gotta jump!

357
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,539
All right!
Okay! All right!

358
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:30,810
Just forget it, forget it! Back to
the story, okay? Back to the story.

359
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,580
Just give me something real man,
something deep, something truthful!

360
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,791
Oh, it rubs me the wrong way
when you say deep, and truth.

361
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:40,853
It just rubs me the wrong way!

362
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:44,557
The guy who wants success in ten days.
The guy who wants everything now.

363
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,126
That guy's gonna talk to me
about truth, about death?

364
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,595
- You don't wanna get in there.
- Get in where, get in where?

365
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,165
You're just saying words, I dunno
what you're talking about!

366
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,600
This is the omphalos of the entire story.

367
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,037
- The omphalos?
- The navel, the central point?

368
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,837
Fuck you, word of the day.

369
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,756
You gotta be kidding.

370
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,203
Dark, Mediterranean man sits at his computer,

371
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,338
a pensive look on his face.

372
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:36,173
- Hi, Ava.
- The curious girl enters the room.

373
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:44,784
Hey, look, Ava, you're a really nice girl, but
I thought you were gonna be quiet as a mouse.

374
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,653
His brow tightens, she offers him a drink.
This is for you.

375
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,866
No, I wasn't. I was
just waving to you and I was...

376
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,733
Look at those two.
They can't resist.

377
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,338
- How's the writing?
- I'm stuck.

378
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,240
On what?

379
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,181
Um, in...

380
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,650
In the story, my character's hired to

381
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,886
find this girl who's wrapped up in a cult.

382
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:23,654
I find her, I don't know what happens next.
She's in some kind of trouble.

383
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,859
Well, I know all about trouble.

384
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,096
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

385
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,266
Well, what kind of trouble
have you been wrapped up in?

386
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,799
It depends how you define trouble.

387
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,670
Sometimes trouble give you the answers.

388
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,777
Maybe your character is conflicted.

389
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:51,417
This girl is drawn to you. She's involved
in something that intrigues you.

390
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,652
Question is, do you explore it?

391
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,529
Or maybe he's falling for her.

392
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,965
Anyway, if you get stuck again,
give me a holler.

393
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:54,146
So he buys me this '66 Barracuda Fastback.

394
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,383
Pearl white, burgundy bucket seats, I love it.

395
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,951
- And Wayne loves it.
- I love it.

396
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:02,388
For about a week. And then the
next week he's just in his shell.

397
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:06,630
He's curled up,
he won't get out of bed, and he's angry.

398
00:27:06,731 --> 00:27:08,494
So angry about everything!

399
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,963
Then suddenly decides
he wants to get rid of it.

400
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,565
- What!
- Not just the car.

401
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,167
He's suddenly obsessed with
the Ramapough Indians.

402
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:19,472
- To what end, I have no idea!
- Is that a new thing?

403
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:22,504
He's riding the Staten Island ferry
back and forth.

404
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:25,845
He's not going to Staten Island,
he's just riding the ferry.

405
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,447
Says he needs to stay on the water.

406
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,583
I don't know what's going on with him.

407
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,315
Maybe it's everything
going on in the world right now.

408
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,987
Maybe that's what's
setting him off.

409
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,423
- Yeah.
- I dunno.

410
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,957
We were so good for so long.

411
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,532
- And now, we're not connected.
- Not working.

412
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,181
I feel like he's bamboozling me,

413
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:49,068
unless maybe it's me.

414
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,270
- No it's not.
- No, my man is fucked up.

415
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,176
I'm sorry, G. I love you, but he's got
some serious issues. He was in a war.

416
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,979
Then he was fucking Team Six.

417
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,548
- What's Team Six?
- It means he was elite.

418
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,183
Okay, the best at what he did.

419
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:09,422
Anything after that, it has to feel
like a let down to some degree.

420
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,591
- She's no let down!
- Yeah man.

421
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,167
No, you know what I mean.

422
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:16,074
I don't mean that.
It's just that now he's a...

423
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,496
he's a glorified handyman.

424
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:22,535
Let's not glorify the fact that Wayne is a
product of the military industrial complex.

425
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:26,739
It's sad, but he made choices. What I know,

426
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,877
is Gigi here is a radiant sunflower.
And one who appreciates the sun,

427
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,377
certainly loves sunflowers.

428
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,850
You're in love with him.
It's really simple.

429
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,725
Battle of the sexes,
people. Men in the lead.

430
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,793
All right, let's do it.
Let's go. I'll play around.

431
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,129
- On the case.
- I'll play around, here.

432
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,564
Get this going.

433
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,599
- Billie Jean gonna go down.
- I remember how to do this.

434
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,801
Oh, yeah.
Dominic is on fire.

435
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,105
Winning does make you feel good.
I haven't won in a while.

436
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:00,339
Wait a second.

437
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,205
Winning is all.

438
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,742
Chiang Kai-shek, remember that.

439
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,111
This is it. This is how it should be.

440
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,347
Friendship is as important as
romantic love, remember that.

441
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:09,841
The cards are life.

442
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,216
Minnesota Fats, remember that.

443
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,888
It's all in the sauce.

444
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:19,892
Listen, Raph, here it is. I've got pages man,
exciting stuff. This is what happens, okay?

445
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,695
Our girl, she's running
from everything, you know?

446
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:26,699
Her family, society, the status
quo's, all getting ripped out.

447
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,706
She's found a new life with this cult,
and I'll tell you this much.

448
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:31,404
It is beautiful and I
am wide open to it.

449
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:34,407
- Now what do you think?
- I think you're out.

450
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,410
I'm out.

451
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,977
I won.

452
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:45,516
You're mine.
You're mine.

453
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,521
Hey, hey, watch out.

454
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,623
Okay, come on you two, let's do it.

455
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,087
<i>Don't be a sap, Renee.</i>

456
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:25,547
You dummy up on me now, you're
looking at 99 years in Cincy.

457
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,094
Where'd you stash the dame?

458
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,560
I'm not telling you where she is.

459
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,066
I don't see that you have
much of a choice, bucko.

460
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,166
You wouldn't understand.

461
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,014
Try me.

462
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,843
She told me about the light.

463
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:48,145
- I'm not talking about a street lamp.
- Yeah.

464
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:54,553
A light? You getting
sucked into her cult.

465
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,523
I'll be lookin' for you next.

466
00:30:57,623 --> 00:31:01,193
- You may not find me.
- Wonderful, wonderful!

467
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:04,130
- Wonderful scenes you've written. I love it
- It's good right?

468
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,868
I can't see him right now. You gotta...
You gotta stall him. Make him go away.

469
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,667
Something! Okay?

470
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,278
Yo, dude! What's up, man?
Come down!

471
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,111
Yeah, I'll be right down.

472
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,814
How you gonna act, man?

473
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,552
- I dunno.
- Oh, cool.

474
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,988
- What does Gigi want?
- She wants me to be cool.

475
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,157
Cool, man, so just stay here, cool spirit.

476
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:36,495
Smoke this, dude. Chill out, when
you're done you go inside. Cool?

477
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,531
Yeah, okay, you want me to stay here?

478
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,964
Yeah, stay here, I gotta piss.

479
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,570
- Wait...
- Dude I gotta piss!

480
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,033
Gigi!

481
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,938
Gigi!

482
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,747
Hey, killer.

483
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,250
Look who it is. Holy shit.

484
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,392
I didn't know you were
going to fucking be here.

485
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,086
What're you doing?

486
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,303
I'm up here with Dominic,

487
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:36,455
yeah, I'm writing with Dom.

488
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:37,957
- Work.
- Yeah, work.

489
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:41,927
- You still acting?
- Yeah, I still got the curse.

490
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:44,971
Well, you still look
like a movie star.

491
00:32:45,072 --> 00:32:46,396
You get botox yet?

492
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,270
These are new. Saw Dom on <i>Law and Order.</i>

493
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,775
Got his ear cut off.

494
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:55,207
He was being such a pussy about it.

495
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,842
You still working at the bar?

496
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,678
Yeah, I'm still working at the bar.

497
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:03,439
I gotta take care of
some stuff with G, so, um...

498
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,684
maybe we have a barbecue later.

499
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,984
Yeah?

500
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,719
She mentioned you guys had a little blow off.

501
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,698
She did?

502
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,681
You know, just in passing.

503
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,940
Thought maybe you'd wanna go get some flowers,

504
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,442
bring them up there, Clark Gable style.

505
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,010
Oh, is that what you think?

506
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,880
Well, all we have up here is flowers.

507
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,235
I guess I'm the flowers.

508
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,087
Yeah, I'm just saying.

509
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,056
- She's still in bed.
- She's in bed?

510
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:48,392
You know that? You know that she's in bed?
How do you know that she's in bed?

511
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,935
How do you know she's still in bed?

512
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,713
You got a lotta information.

513
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,947
Just up here riding with Dom, you know?

514
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,346
You said that.

515
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:22,461
- Runs good, don't it.
- Yeah.

516
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,029
Hey, man, you haven't
changed a bit. Look out!

517
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,106
G. Hey, G.

518
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,341
G?

519
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,889
Hey, man, nice haircut, dude.
Like the way you're wearing it.

520
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,200
Thanks, man, thanks.

521
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,769
You know, what's going on? I
thought you were driving to L.A?

522
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:04,647
Dude, so did I.

523
00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:06,572
We got to Ohio and
Wayne pulled a 180.

524
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:10,309
- Wants to work it out with Gigi
- How long you gonna stay, you think?

525
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,311
Dude, I dunno. Could be a while.

526
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:16,048
Hey can you do me a favor? There's a black
bag in there, it's Wayne's. Can you grab it?

527
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:19,451
- Just in the back, dude.
- Yeah, no I got it.

528
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,521
- What is this?
- Oh, bro, that's my head shot man.

529
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,458
- What do you need a head shot for?
- Oh, it's for my show.

530
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,060
What show?

531
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,330
You didn't hear it, dude? I got my own show.
Wayne's such a dick!

532
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,867
- I don't get it.
- Dude, I don't get it either, bro.

533
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,637
I'm just teaching my class at
Point Pleasant one day, surfing

534
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,973
It's like the best day of my life everyday.

535
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:43,108
Then getting changed on the beach, right?

536
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:47,246
This guy comes up to me. He's like
"Hey, bro, I've been watching you."

537
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,321
And I'm like
"Hey, bro, what the fuck, man?"

538
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:51,550
Because I thought he was
trying to pick me up, dude.

539
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,018
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

540
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,088
Happens that this guy works
for Jerry Bruckenheimer dude.

541
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,024
- Jerry Bruckheimer?
- Jerry Bruck-heemer.

542
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,326
- Bruckheimer.
- Yeah, dude, he did <i>Armageddon.</i>

543
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,796
He does <i>The Amazing Race,</i>
all these huge things!

544
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,165
- Jerr... Jerry Bruckheimer.
- Jerry Bruckheimer, yeah, dude!

545
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,567
He called me on my cellphone,
I pick up. I'm like "Hello"...

546
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,843
I'm like
"Okay, dude, yeah, go fuck yourself'",

547
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:12,604
because I thought
it was Vasper calling.

548
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,407
Dude, it was really Jerry Bruckheimer,
he called me up, he was like

549
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,310
"Hey, man, I want you to come in,
I want to talk about your show."

550
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,831
So I go in and sit down
with him, dude.

551
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:21,580
You know what?

552
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,616
Great guy, man, he's wearing these
tight jeans, he's kinda staring.

553
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:28,120
He's got these beady eyes, so
I'm like "Hey man", you know?

554
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,223
"Is everything cool here?" and he's
like "Yeah, everything is cool here."

555
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:35,751
So then, we start talking
and we just get each other dude.

556
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,129
Yeah.

557
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:40,065
He's like my other brother
from another mother, dude.

558
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,768
We're just mano e mano, really vibing out,

559
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,538
and then he turns to me
he's like "You're my guy."

560
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,242
- Guy for what?
- Dude, for my show I just told you about!

It's a lot of money, dude.

569
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,237
Hey, man, dude hang on a sec, man.

570
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:21,340
My new agents are working out
the contract, fucking UTA.

571
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,477

573
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,551
UTA, man, that's top ten.

574
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:37,206
Hey man, what are you up to, dude?
What're you doing here?

575
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:39,424
I'm just, you know man...

576

577
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,664
You got your ear cut off or something?

578
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,566
That was a while ago, but, yeah.

579
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,002
That's great news, that's awesome news.

580
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:53,005
Awesome. The door's that way.

581
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,973
Look at all the chimes, man!
Everywhere, just chimes.

582
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,582
Okay, man, I'll see you inside.

583
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,088
G. G, wait, G!
God dammit!

584
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,357
- Gigi just pull out?
- She did.

585
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,410
What she do that for?
Did she know I was here?

586
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:15,060
I don't know.

587
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,363
- Come inside. Wayne!
- I'm here.

588
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,166
Fuck.

589
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,041
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right. Um...

590
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:33,078
I really don't know if she knew you were here.

591
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,046
I'm sorry, man, I didn't mean
to do that. I was just...

592
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,751
- It's good, see, I'm cool.
- You okay?

593
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,352
I'm okay, yeah. What about you? You okay?

594
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,222
Yeah, man, I'm good, man, I'm good.

595
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,528
- That's good.
- You know...

596
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:52,529
Gigi hasn't been picking up
my calls for a few days, so...

597
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,669
- But I'm good, you know.
- You guys gonna...

598
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,371
- have it out or something? I mean...
- Absolutely not.

599
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,743
Negative.

600
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,078
- Because I'm up here...
- Is she gonna break up with me?

601
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,070
Wayne, I dunno what she's gonna do.

602
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:15,354
I really don't know.

603
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,789
It's just, I'm up here, I'm trying to work

604
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,170
Yeah, that's what Raph said.

605
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,694
You guys are working up here.

606
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,964
I didn't know you were gonna be up here you
know, so it was a little bit of a surprise.

607
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,354
Well, I told G, you know.

608
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,302
What are you guys doing here,
what's Raph doing here?

609
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:34,070
He's writing a script with me. We're
trying to write a screenplay.

610
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,409
About what?

611
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,047
It's about some fucked up, you know,
like some noir stuff. Some...

612
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,428
missing people, and things...

613
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:45,550
That's cool, man,
I'm not gonna get in the way.

614
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,321
I just wanted to see G man. I don't know
if she's been picking up my calls...

615
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,128
But I'm here to make it cool,
you know.

616
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:53,292
It's cool, I mean is she cool?
You think she's cool?

617
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:56,226
- What do you think?
- You think she's being uncool?

618
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,233
- I'm asking you a question. Can you focus?
- Okay.

619
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:05,502
I'm saying that I'm cool,
and I'm wondering if she's cool.

620
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,041
- Is she cool?
- She's gonna come back.

621
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,343
I'm just asking if she's cool.

622
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,612
She's been normal.

623
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:17,382
Are you not hearing what I'm saying?
I'm just asking is she cool.

624
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,150
I dunno, I mean,
I'm not sure what we're talking about.

625
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,732
Don't worry about it.

626
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,259
Where's my bag?

627
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,061
- Huh?
- Where's my bag?

628
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,399
I dunno... Maybe...

629
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,171
- Maybe that's it there.
- What's it doing over there?

630
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,912
- What's it doing over here?
- I have no idea.

631
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,382
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about that.
I didn't mean to... You okay?

632
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,148
Yeah, I'm good.

633
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,492
All right, see you later, Wayne.

634
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,638
It's just we're being pushed out!

635
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:17,309
- It's a reality surfer show, so what?
- So what?

636
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:19,144
It starts with a stupid surfer show,

637
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:23,548
or Idol, <i>Top Model,</i> then your Jennifer
Hudson winning a fucking oscar!

638
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,750
Do you wanna work?

639
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,687
- But you act like you don't care!
- I don't care?

640
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:33,658
I don't know, just...
What are we missing? What?

641
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,763
- Maybe, Devon... maybe he just has 'it'.
- Definitely has 'Id'.

642
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:41,366
- So you agree, he has 'it'?
- He's a beach bum, he's a pleasure seeker.

643
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,435
What does that have to do with having 'it'?

644
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:44,903
Having 'it'?

645
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,038
- That's what the fuck I'm talking about!
- Thought you meant 'Id'.

646
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:51,109
Do you think he has that something special?
Jesus Christ, Raph.

647
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,945
I wouldn't go so far as to say <i>Endless Summer,</i>

648
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,248
has 'it', whatever that is exactly.

649
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,298
Maybe people are seeing
something in him,

650
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,986
that they just don't see in us,
and that something is 'it'.

651
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:04,356
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- He's on TV, we're not!

652
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:06,558
He's got a big agent, we don't.

653
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,628
I bet you, in a year, he's doing
a war film with Ed Harris,

654
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:14,364
and you and I are still shaking Cosmos in
Brooklyn, talking about Bertolt Brecht.

655
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:22,038
I'm not gonna change my philosophy for
living because Devon got a reality TV show.

656
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:29,748
Come on! Okay, so what is this
so called philosophy for living, Raph?

657
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,350
Because the last I looked,
you were a 40 year old bartender.

658
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,453
I don't give a motherfuck about <i>Idol!</i>

659
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,988
I don't give a motherfuck
about Jennifer Hudson,

660
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,524
surfing, 'it',
or whatever you're talking about!

661
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,359
Now I wanna end this conversation.

662
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,395
Either you're doing something wrong,

663
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:49,401
or you're doing everything right.
That could mean that you just don't have 'it'.

664
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:54,406
If you have talent, if you have
real talent, you don't question it,

665
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:58,645
and people that constantly question it,
are the mediocre ones,

666
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,044
and that's what you are.
Mediocre.

667
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,868
Is that how you really feel about me?

668
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,125
I mean, is that how you really feel?

669
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,661
- You're doing it right now!
- What? I'm doing what?

670
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,096
You're begging approval.

671
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:22,234
You have this pathetic need for
validation, look at you. Even from me.

672
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,570
Even from me, the 40 year old bartender.

673
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,906
Well, at least I'm putting myself out there.

674
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:30,212
At least I'm going for something.

675
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:33,812
You know what, that takes courage.
You're doing nothing!

676
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:38,450
You've become a novelty act,
and I'll tell you something,

677
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,983
you're kidding yourself
if you think my sister

678
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:43,619
would ever have a
serious relationship with you.

679
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,789
You're an entertainment.

680
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,828
No one we know takes you seriously.
No one.

681
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,399
You're a fucking joke.

682
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:43,048
Should take a blowtorch to this fucking place.

683
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:47,833
Dude, there's some chick out here,
bro, it's like a mirage.

684
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,921
She's so fucking hot, dude.

685
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:55,627
- You know her?
- That's Ava. She used to work for Gigi.

686
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,296
You're not gonna land her
the way you do those L.A skanks.

687
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,599
Couple of tiki drinks with some coke.

688
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,799
Dude, nobody drinks tiki drinks.

689
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,408
Do you think I can fuck her, bro?

690
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:16,713
- See all this stuff out here? See all this?
- Yeah.

691
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,175
It's my stuff.
Gigi put all my stuff out here.

692
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:23,019
Wanna bring it back in?

693
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,625
She thinks it's over, she's wrong.

694
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:31,394
Well, do you think,
there's a chance it might be?

695
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,696
Might be what?

696
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,104
- Over, dude.
- Come here.

697
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:42,307
- What?
- Come here.

698
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,675
- Come on, man. What did I do, dude?
- Come here.

699
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,783
- Come here.
- What? What are you doing?

700
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:55,220
- Nothing man.
- Nothing? What are you doing? Hey.

701
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,655
- Hey.
- Hey.

702
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:57,722
- Hey.
- Hey.

703
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,225
- Hey.
- Why?

704
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:01,259
Why?

705
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,962
What are you doing, man?
What are you doing, stop.

706
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:07,465
- What are you prepared to do?
- No, Wayne, don't get yourself worked up.

707
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,168
- Is God big and white?
- Don't get yourself worked up.

708
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,038
- Do you believe in the Pope?
- Chill out, stay in the pocket.

709
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:16,241
I'm in the pocket.
You in the pocket?

710
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:19,254
You want the same shit to happen
that happened in the city?

711
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:20,810
You want that to happen here?

712
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,513
Do you?

713
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,484
Do you, man?

714
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:29,621
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

715
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,121
- I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah, me too, man.

716
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,593
Hey, tell me
this. She 18?

717
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,262
- Hey.
- Hi.

718
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,364
What's happening?

719
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:16,866
- You look nice and comfy.
- I feel comfy.

720
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,770
- You know Wayne?
- I do.

721
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,139
I'm his brother, Devon.

722
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,976
- You're Ava.
- I am.

723
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,981
Hey.

724
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:35,251
Welcome to our illustrious country
home, Wayne's brother, Devon.

725
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,258
I surf.

726
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,864
Cool. Professionally?

727
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:48,176
Yeah, but that's not all I do.

728
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:51,503
I'm a philanthropist.
Got my own clothing line.

729
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,372
Devon, Devon!

730
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,675
I gotta get in the pocket man.
Gimme your car keys.

731
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:59,842
Oh, they're in the visor.

732
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:10,622
He's fine. So, like,
what do you do?

733
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,792
What are you a professional at?

734
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,626
Wayne said you're en entrepreneur?

735
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,964
Did I just see Wayne drive down the road?

736
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,865
Yeah, he just took a drive
to get his head straight.

737
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,707
- Hi, Dev.
- Hey, G.

738
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:32,742
Just met Ava.
She's very pretty.

739
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,579
You know...

740
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,548
Wayne really wants to work it out with you.

741
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,625
- He's trying, you know, he's really trying.
- He's crazy.

742
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,371
Izzy, I didn't get your messages.
The service is in and out up here.

743
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,808
<i>I had to go to the emergency animal
hospital, all night with him.</i>

744
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:06,444
- <i>All night and...</i>
- The service is bad. If I knew...

745
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,248
Of course I would have called you if I
knew Benny hurt his eye, I mean, what...

746
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:15,086
Just tell me what's... What happened?
Tell me what happened? Is he okay?

747
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:19,691
<i>I don't wanna talk to you until you're done
writing this screenplay, or whatever it is.</i>

748
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,161
Are you serious? Are you seriously
doing this to me right now?

749
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,486
Can you put Benny on speaker phone?
I wanna talk to him.

750
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,130
No, no, no.

751
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,068
<i>That's ridiculous. I'm not putting
your dog on speaker phone.</i>

752
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:33,035
Izz? Izzy,
are you there?

753
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,407
- You okay?
- Jesus!

754
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:41,546
- Devon, you just scared the shit out of me.
- All right, dude, chill out.

755
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,113
We're in a country.
It's illustrious here.

756
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:59,631
- How you doing, babe?
- What the hell?

757
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:00,950
What happened to you?

758
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:04,335
Me and your brother
getting down at the deeper truths.

759
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,795
How's it going with you and Wayne?

760
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,540
- I haven't seen him yet.
- Yeah?

761
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,577
Well, if you need me,
you shoot up a flare, okay?

762
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,879
You still got it!

763
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:18,449
Look, I'm throwing a goddamn party
here tonight, lighting this place up.

764
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:22,077
You got an old suit
in that collection for me?

765
00:50:22,178 --> 00:50:23,855
A party? Yeah, sure.

766
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,222
- I have a suit, of course.
- Okay, good.

767
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,197
- You smell that night jasmine, do you?
- Yeah, I smell it.

768
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:43,172
Be cool, Raph. Okay?
Just be cool.

769
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,057
Hold up, broheim.

770
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:02,193
What's up superstar, I heard
about your show. Congrats.

771
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,161
Thanks, friend.
Nice ride.

772
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,732
What do you want, Dev?

773
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,702
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the store.

774
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,504
Are you gonna get something for Gigi?

775
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:18,207
I'm gonna get something for everybody you want
me to pick you up a nice Rose there, Venice?

776
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,378
Your eyes, my eyes.

777
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:28,317
Your eyes, my eyes, bro.
I'm watching you. All day.

778
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,328
Hi.

779
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,897
Hi, Devon.

780
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,420
- Hello?
<i>- What're you doing?</i>

781
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,191
I'm thinking.

782
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,398
<i>What's all that noise?</i>

783
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,871
- Cooking.
- <i>Mm, what're you cooking?</i>

784
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,278
Everything.

785
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:28,944
<i>- Sauce?</i>
<i>- </i> Yeah.

786
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,113
<i>Polenta?</i>

787
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,315
<i>Nice.</i>

788
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,052
<i>Lamb?</i>

789
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,925
- What do you want?
- <i>Come around the corner, by the pond.</i>

790
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,801
Hey, how's the sauce?

791
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:58,509
- Good. What're those?
- Would you like to have a seat?

792
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,144
Where'd you get 'em?
Did you take them?

793
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:03,181
Don't worry about where I got 'em.
Just sit down, please?

794
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:04,682
I wanna talk.

795
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:06,977
Did you take those chairs
from somebody's porch?

796
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:07,819
I borrowed them.

797
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:09,754
Just bring 'em back, Jesus.

798
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,420
I thought we could sit down
and talk and be nice.

799
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,356
What you being so uptight about?

800
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:15,293
- You asked me to marry you!
- How is that a bad thing?

801
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,594
I don't see how this is a bad...

802
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,162
How and when you did it is the bad thing.

803
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:21,263
And then you just took off?
That's a bad thing!

804
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,203
- I mean what were you thinking?
- I don't know.

805
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:35,213
My head was fucked up, okay, but I've
been thinking about this for a long time.

806
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,822
Jesus Christ, Wayne.

807
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,346
Jesus Christ what?

808
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:41,252
What do you want from me?
I love you.

809
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,018
I wanna marry you.

810
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:47,692
Where are you going? Don't you
think I know what's wrong with me?

811
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:51,262
Please, come back.
Please, come back here.

812
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:56,234
I got something for you. It's an anger
card, just for you to... Sit down.

813
00:53:56,334 --> 00:54:00,972
- Babe, sit down.
- Hey, I don't wanna sit.

814
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:04,083
"There's nothing really
worth getting angry about.

815
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:06,308
What're you angry about this time?"

816
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,682
- Are you asking me this? I don't get it.
- No that's to myself.

817
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:15,097
I've been carrying that
around for a few weeks now.

818
00:54:15,198 --> 00:54:16,721
I write stuff down that...

819
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:18,005
Triggers?

820
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:21,657
Yeah! More I write it out,
more I can start to see the...

821
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,398
- Patterns?
- Patterns.

822
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,266
And then I can start to
figure some of that shit out.

823
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,503
Okay. This is very
evolved for you.

824
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,486
Is this some kind of trick?

825
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,377
What do you think?
No, it's not a trick.

826
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,180
Okay, it's a trick.
You're being tricked.

827
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,752
"Lights."

828
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:50,185
Yeah? Okay, I know that one.

829
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,658
"Bruni the super?"

830
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:58,093
- Yeah, that fucking guy.
- Well, I know. Me too, for that matter.

831
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,597
Rain...

832
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,834
Rain gets you mad?

833
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:09,073
No, not the rain. Umbrellas. People aren't
careful you could get your eye poked out.

834
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:13,644
They could easily lift it up, or tilt it.
They don't fucking do that.

835
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,178
Get poked with a fucking umbrella.

836
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,885
I don't see anything on here
about the Barracuda.

837
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,758
Are you listening,
are you really reading this?

838
00:55:23,859 --> 00:55:25,856
I'm working my way
up to the big one.

839
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:33,362
Why would you wait till now to give me this?
After you've caused all these problems...

840
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,370
You do something like this, and then
you propose, that's reasonable.

841
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,404
But, not on the heels of a huge argument.

842
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,809
And then you...

843
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,912
<i>Did you ever see a dream
walking?</i>

844
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,981
<i>Well, I did</i>

845
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:54,819
<i>Did you ever see a dream
talking?</i>

846
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:56,487
<i>Well, I did</i>

847
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:59,924
<i>Did you ever see heaven
right in your arms?</i>

848
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,326
<i>Saying I love you, I do</i>

849
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:03,628
Stop it!

850
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:05,863
Well the dream that was walking, I...

851
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,529
That was a little high.

852
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,701
Stop. Stop!

853
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,773
I love you...

854
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,824
I didn't want you to leave.

855
00:56:17,925 --> 00:56:19,875
I never want you to leave.

856
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,831
But you're always fucking leaving.

857
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:29,320
I'm working on it, baby. What do
you think the card's all about?

858
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,222
I don't wanna leave. I don't
want you to leave either.

859
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,694
Let's get married.

860
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:43,732
- Oh, my God!
- What, oh, my God?

861
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,338
I can't believe you did it again!

862
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,572
- What am I doing?
- You're not getting it.

863
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,508
<i>Dominic! Hey, it's me, Kaplan.</i>

864
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:28,479
<i>Listen, bad news,
the money went away for a little project.</i>

865
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:31,048
<i>So, I won't be needing your script.</i>

866
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:34,425
<i>But hey, these things happen, you
know, so, you gotta stick it out.</i>

867
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:36,270
<i>The money was there,
now it's not.</i>

868
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,422
<i>It's very frustrating,
but what can you do?</i>

869
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:41,657
<i>Okay, take care, babe.
I gotta go. Bye.</i>

870
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:47,996
Fuck.

871
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:07,985
You were crying.
Why were you crying?

872
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,020
Because they sliced my ear off, dude.

873
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,693
But that's not what would happen.

874
00:58:11,794 --> 00:58:14,325
That's blunt trauma.
You would go into shock or something.

875
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:16,660
You've never had your ear cut off.
How the fuck do you know?

876
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,996
No, but I've been shot. Got a
piece of shrapnel on my thigh,

877
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:22,967
seen my buddies get their fingers blown off.
That's not what happens. You go into shock.

878
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:26,103
This guy, it was very close to my head, man.

879
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,758
It hit nerves and shit.

880
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:31,175
What about playing like
an interior decorator?

881
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:34,979
Or maybe like a hairdresser?

882
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,715
Stop it.
Come on, Wayne.

883
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,582
- Wanna do a shot?
- Yes.

884
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,326
Let's go out.

885
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:21,992
Cheers, bro!

886
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,160
Cheers!

887
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,093
I want you, right there.
You, give me...

888
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:33,637
<i>Check, check, check!</i>

889
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:37,475
<i>DJ Fluxus is gonna juxt
your whole position, people.</i>

890
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,975
<i>Everyone back down on the dance floor.</i>

891
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,677
Let's do it.

892
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:08,299
Listen to me, you're my everything.
You're all that means anything to me.

893
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:13,502
You're my ice cream sundae,
you understand. You get me?

894
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,774
Why don't we go to Niagara Falls
and have a honeymoon?

895
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,112
- Hey.
- Hey.

896
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:27,184
Hi! Those were seriously
some good dance moves.

897
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:30,187
- You too!
- Thanks.

898
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:34,692
Cold water doesn't bother me. I can
keep my hand in there all night.

899
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,625
Maybe you should do that.

900
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,565
No.

901
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,537
Sorry.

902
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:49,471
What the fuck?
You're not into this?

903
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,485
- Come here.
- What? Oh.

904
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:20,337
<i>Everybody on the dance
floor. Everybody, come down.</i>

905
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:24,375
We do the honeymoon now, and if that
goes well, we can get married later.

906
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,443
- Know what I mean?
- I like that.

907
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:29,947
And if we get really crazy,
we could drive to Canada.

908
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:32,549
Keep on driving to Montreal.

909
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:35,717
Is that something you wanna do?
Don't you wanna do that?

910
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,520
Do you wanna do that?

911
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,094
What?

912
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:46,895
Look I'm sorry, it's just, you know, I...

913
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,663
Have a girlfriend.

914
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,835
That's not what I'm talking about.

915
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,346
All right, okay, okay, next.

916
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,282
You know what the main
ingredient of the marshmallow is?

917
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,151
- Sugar!
- No.

918
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,620
- Horse?
- Cocaine?

919
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,056
- No. What?
- Horse... horse hoof.

920
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:14,022
- Hooves, hooves!
- Oh, my God.

921
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,599
Politics.
Politics people, politics.

922
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:25,502
All right, last one.
Who's on the 500 dollar bill?

923
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:29,173
William McKinley.
William McKinley. William McKinley.

924
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:31,709
- Bitches.
- Who the fuck knows that?

925
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,043
No one. That's the point.

926
01:03:33,144 --> 01:03:36,647
William McKinley was a fucking president of
the United States and no one knows who he is.

927
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,619
Everybody knows
who Washington is.

928
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,586
Lincoln, fucking Ben Franklin wasn't
even president and he's on some money.

929
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:45,456
But what the fuck did William McKinley do?

930
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:48,926
- He got assassinated.
- He did get assassinated.

931
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:51,095
- Does anybody know?
- He was President?

932
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:52,659
I've never even heard of him.

933
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,099
They don't even make 500
dollar bills any more.

934
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,900
What's your point?

935
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,069
My point is, McKinley never made his mark.

936
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,706
Oh.

937
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:06,210
- So you're a man on a mission.
- Yeah, I'm a man on a mission.

938
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,610
You know, I wanna make a mark.

939
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,079
What then?

940
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:18,188
I don't know. That's it.
I get to live my life doing what I love.

941
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,859
Again, and again and again, and again.

942
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:25,329
And then we die,
and then it's over and who cares?

943
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,529
We're all fucking just bacteria, dude.

944
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:34,772
Why are you so caught up in making a mark for?

945
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:38,442
I wake up every morning with this...

946
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:44,546
pain in my stomach like I did something wrong.
I don't wanna feel that shit any more.

947
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,684
Shame.

948
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:49,887
I don't know what it is
but I don't wanna feel it.

949
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:52,220
Was talking about
self-loathing. Shame.

950
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,594
You gotta look to it man.

951
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,698
Everything else will come.

952
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,203
I don't know...

953
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,441
But you do know.

954
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:17,714
It's exactly that. The weight of all this
stuff gets lifted when you embrace love.

955
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:21,285
All of this other stuff is real.

956
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:24,953
But it's good to align
yourself with love. It helps.

957
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,157
What's the point, if we don't have love?

958
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,228
Yeah.

959
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:33,094
Why are we here?

960
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:40,804
Yeah, dude, love. Riding high energy.
When I surf, I feel love.

961
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:45,042
A wave is like a wavelength
of energy. It's moving water

962
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:48,679
and I'm riding the surface.
Dude, think about that!

963
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:53,584
I'm in perfect harmony with
mother nature when I'm surfing.

964
01:05:53,684 --> 01:05:56,551
- That's amazing!
- That is amazing.

965
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,023
I love Gigi.

966
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,860
I love Gigi too.

967
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,132
I love you.

968
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,301
Take it easy, tiger.
She loves you too.

969
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:13,904
I'm serious.

970
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:19,107
- I love you too.
- Here have a marshmallow.

971
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:23,745
Love is a giant pickle.

972
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,949
I'm in love with you.

973
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:34,491
These people, they don't know what we're
talking about. I'm in love with you.

974
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:38,259
Wayne, I'm sorry you have to hear this.
I got nothing against you.

975
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,835
There's something alive here
between Gigi and me.

976
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,473
Right.

977
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:54,809
Remember back in the day, you wanted to drive
down the Pan-American highway with me?

978
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,714
Remember that?

979
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:01,334
You wanted to drive
all the way down there with me?

980
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,285
But I wasn't ready.

981
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,658
- These last few days have been so...
- Let's hear him out.

982
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:18,435
Gigi, I can love you like
you never, ever, ever...

983
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:24,574
Like earth, like magic.
Just meet me in my car at 4:00 a.m..

984
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:28,943
You don't bring anything.
We gonna make that drive.

985
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,638
Hey, Dev, you're in the wrong car.

986
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,794
Sorry.

987
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,747
Good night.

988
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,544
What's up big boy?

989
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,376
You know,
I like what you guys have written so far.

990
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,079
Yeah, what do you like about it?

991
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,322
I like that they fall in love.

992
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,724
Does she fall through with the double cross?

993
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:30,144
Because that would be heart breaking.

994
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,461
Would.

995
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,522
Think she goes through with the double cross?

996
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,689
I absolutely do.
