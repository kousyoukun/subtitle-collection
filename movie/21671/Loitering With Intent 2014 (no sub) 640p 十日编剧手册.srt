1
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,297
<i>¶ Ooh yeah ¶</i>

2
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,847
Oh shit. Hey man, I gotta get to
Brooklyn, I gotta get to work,

3
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,617
open the bar, I gotta work on
this audition for the morning.

4
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,218
What're you going in on?

5
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,588
Now is this scene before or
after you saw your own leg off?

6
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,293
I've seen slaves breaking their
backs in the fields. Have you?

7
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,020
Pardon me, pardon me, I'm very sorry.
No, we

8
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:07,900
should head out. We
gotta be there at four.

9
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:13,605
That's enough, from both of you.
And you... wait. That's enough.

10
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,140
We need you up there, kid.

11
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,577
I'll be right up.

12
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,115
Brother, prepping an audition or doing an
audition, or resting from an audition.

13
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,522
You can never commit,
because you never know, you

14
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:27,686
might get a job, but you
never do get a job.

15
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,988
Sorry, but you don't.

16
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,494
Okay, who needs what?

17
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,697
These three here, we need
two Ripostos one Fellini.

18
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,568
I don't know what he wants, and that
freak down there, I'm not certain.

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,704
Oh shit, is that Raphael?

20
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,174
I was a gay on the Woody
Allen movie you did.

21
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,310
I'm gonna be right with you.
Just kidding.

22
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,133
I knew you had a small
part but you were great.

23
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,014
Thought you were gonna be huge!

24
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,182
What happened?

25
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,859
When I headed for
that door I realized

26
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,895
if I went out, I would
never come back.

27
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,198
I didn't want to
never come back

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,037
but I couldn't come
back out onto the stage, so

29
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,840
there wasn't anything left
so I went up the ladder.

30
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,246
You're The King. The King.
You're Joe Strummer.

31
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,381
- I'm Joe Strummer.
- You're a sonic producer.

32
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,717
I'm a sonic producer!

33
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,989
I think I liked it. If you don't mind
I wanna sit for the second scene.

34
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,925
Sure, no. What you
did, really good.

35
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:44,196
Really good. Very good, thanks.

36
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,038
<i>I don't know what else to tell you.
You're in an age void.</i>

37
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,135
Would you like a Peroni?

38
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,571
I want you to change
your attitude, chief.

39
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:56,475
I want you to ask me again,
and this time, with a smile.

40
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,050
Go fuck yourself!
Get the fuck out!

41
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,086
Yeah, we will get
the fuck out of here!

42
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,008
Look at me, look at me.

43
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:11,714
Dude I can't do this anymore.
I'm gonna fucking kill someone.

44
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,202
- In an age void.
- What?

45
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,370
They don't know what to do with me.
That's the problem.

46
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,373
Look, it's Lincoln Center.
It's a cultural superstore.

47
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:33,278
It's white boy business, I mean, you
getting that part is a long shot, come on!

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,914
Well what's the point
then, Raph?

49
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,584
Please, tell me, I mean it's
the same five directors,

50
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,986
the same 10 writers,
the same 20 actors,

51
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,257
they just do everything! It's not good
for theaters, it's fucking boring.

52
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,726
Look, it's a tight circle,
we're not part of it.

53
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:52,030
You know the days of Joe Papp, off the
street, the living theater, that's done!

54
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,466
Who's off the street?
I'm trained, well trained.

55
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,602
- I know you're trained.
- I went to conservatory!

56
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,705
Yeah but you didn't go to Juilliard, and
that's what this is all about, right?

57
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,703
What big shows you were
in, who saw you do it,

58
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,742
my dad is Edward Albee,
all that kind of stuff.

59
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,377
- Edward Albee doesn't have kids.
- I know.

60
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,346
- He's gay.
- Doesn't mean he doesn't have kids.

61
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,915
- But he doesn't.
- Hey, Dom! Who's this, your pimp?

62
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,216
Hey, how you doing,
what a sight!

63
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,453
You look fantastic. Look who
it is, Kaplan!

64
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,689
Hey don't mind us. We were
running a scene right now...

65
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,153
I can't believe I'm
running into you maniacs,

66
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:22,294
you guys have been
on my mind all week!

67
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,129
- Was it in a naughty way?
- Take it easy.

68
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,098
It's always a little
naughty with you, Raphael.

69
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,133
Tell us the less naughty
parts for now.

70
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,636
All right. That was an amazing
night at your bar last month.

71
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,505
We've had so many amazing nights
at the bar with you, Kaplan.

72
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,141
No, we were talking movies with
your writer friend, Jonathan.

73
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,810
- You had those leather pants on!
- We love those pants.

74
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,868
Wasn't Jonathan talking
about doing some low

75
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,015
budget Raymond Chandler
detective story thing?

76
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,584
- No.
- That was our idea.

77
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,919
Who was mentioning
the<i> Sweet Smell of Success?</i>

78
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,588
- "Match me, Sidney"
- Match me.

79
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,392
I love that movie. What's Jonathan up to?
I love his show.

80
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,361
Can you get me in touch? I promised my
boss I'd find something interesting

81
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,096
for him to produce
for under 300 grand,

82
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,565
he's looking to shuffle some money
around on a tax credit thing.

83
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,736
I don't know what Jonathan' up
to, but we wrote that script.

84
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,805
- It's written, it's done.
- What script?

85
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,108
The Raymond Chandler thing.

86
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:10,709
We're burning down the
cultural superstar rasta.

87
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:15,180
Wow, look at you guys, that's great.
Did you write parts for yourselves?

88
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,583
- Of course.
- Yeah, we're the leads. We play brothers.

89
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,980
Okay, well what's it about?

90
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,925
Don't be shy, Dominic.
Tell Kaplan what it's about.

91
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,861
It's, uh, well,
basically, um...

92
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,497
- Well, we play brothers.
- Yeah, I got that.

93
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:37,002
And, you know, we own
a detective agency.

94
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,771
- And it's a noir.
- Absolutely.

95
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,307
Uh, you know, basically...

96
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:47,913
Well, it's an elevated genre film. At least
that's how aunt Carrie described it.

97
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,549
- Aunt Carrie read it?
- Yeah, she loved it.

98
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,884
How the hell did you get
aunt Carrie to read it?

99
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,486
- No offense.
- None taken.

100
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,189
- We know some people.
- Yeah, we're tapped in.

101
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,091
Well, what'd she say?

102
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,193
She said, er, what did
she say, Raph?

103
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,228
- Said it was raw.
- Yeah, oh yeah.

104
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,131
She said it was really
raw and original,

105
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,667
and that she'd love
to get her hands on it.

106
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,635
It's called "The
Blackmailers Don't Shoot."

107
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,871
- Or maybe "The Black Mask."
- Yeah, I like that one.

108
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,908
What the fuck, is it low budget? You guys
think you can make it for under 300 k?

109
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,578
- Oh, yeah.
- Super low. Really low.

110
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,513
- Less than that.
- This sounds perfect.

111
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:26,151
My boss is looking for something new.
I get to produce this project.

112
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,886
Show me the script,
let's do this.

113
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,289
No wait, hold on
a minute, you know...

114
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,558
We're doing rewrites, we're
swamped, you know, we can't.

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,895
This money goes away in two weeks, we don't
have to jump through any hoops with them.

116
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,798
- I just need to see the script.
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,933
Look I get you guys,
I always have.

118
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,498
I can give you ten days, that's it.
But we're

119
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:47,005
meeting with other
writers, so get it to me.

120
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,542
How you gonna get out of this.
We don't even know aunt Carrie.

121
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,144
I auditioned for her once.

122
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,748
- You can't write a script in ten days.
- Yes, but we can.

123
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,350
We, together.

124
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,787
Come on, we've been talking
about doing this for years.

125
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,958
I have an idea. What do writers do?
They go to the country.

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,254
We'll go to the country.
To my sister's house.

127
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,497
We'll have it all to ourselves.

128
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:16,501
Peace, quiet,
no distractions...

129
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,805
Let's just get there,
get down, and do it.

130
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,464
Photosynthesis baby.

131
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,470
Oh, I forgot how peaceful
it is in the country.

132
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,241
Nature will flip you, Dominic.

133
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,279
Flip you for real,
remember that.

134
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,486
Yeah!

135
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,369
Police activity,
people. stay back.

136
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,739
- Dominic, grab the bags.
- Oh, yeah.

137
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,881
That's very cute. Very cute.

138
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,286
<i>To Gigi's country manor.</i>

139
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,813
Starting tomorrow, I think
we should cleanse it out.

140
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,392
No booze.

141
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,627
I saw this documentary
on Ingmar Bergman

142
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,663
- at the Film Forum.
- I love the Film Forum.

143
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:28,300
He said the demons want you to
stay in bed with cold feet.

144
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:33,238
So the first thing he does is he gets
up in the morning and he takes a walk.

145
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,607
And then he writes.

146
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,083
You want some gross
character of a woman!

147
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,553
That means power makes you more masculine,
and masculine means you're ugly.

148
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,556
Well shame on you,
you macho shithead!

149
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,558
All right, fuck this. Eureka!

150
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,462
Yes, that's it! It's a
simple missing persons case.

151
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,965
Gets more evolved
when we find the girl.

152
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,501
- Recognize!
- It's a character piece,

153
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,103
- masked as a noir,
- Wonderful.

154
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,237
Wonderful, wonderful!

155
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,939
Maybe a dubonnet with a twist.

156
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,240
It's a secret!

157
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,142
Corruption that echoes
the world in which they live.

158
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,612
Yes, uh, dark shame.

159
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,819
It could be a double cross.

160
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,153
Could be, a double cross.

161
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,722
- Genius!
- Yeah!

162
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,087
<i>Maybe she joins a group,</i>
<i>a cult, like the Source Family.</i>

163
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:01,826
A cult could be fun. It's a period
piece, but maybe we make it a mash up.

164
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,629
Set in Los Angeles over
a 24 hour sequence.

165
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,798
Some dialog, dancing but heavy,

166
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,466
like<i> The Umbrellas</i>
<i>of Cherbourg.</i>

167
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,335
- I love that movie.
- Okay, so, dancing...

168
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,803
Mm hm.

169
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,472
- In a noir.
- Yep.

170
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:18,877
That's good, right, we haven't seen that!
That's good.

171
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,813
Okay, so, she...

172
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,582
Who's... who's that?

173
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,456
That's what I wanna know.

174
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,809
- Hello.
- Hi.

175
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,410
How you doing?

176
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,980
- You must be Dominic.
- How do you know who I am?

177
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,216
I've seen pictures of you.

178
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,553
Er... Where?

179
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,690
In Gigi's store. I used
to work there, I'm Ava.

180
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,893
Oh, yeah. How is it
we've never met?

181
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,696
- I guess we've just never seen each other.
- You don't look like an Ava.

182
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,015
What does an Ava look like.

183
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,234
You change your name? Let me see your ID.
Got your passport?

184
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,370
Some outfit you have on. Is your
name Lawrence by any chance?

185
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,706
Of Arabia? Close,
Raphael, of Brooklyn.

186
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,775
You wanna borrow this?
I got this one in Marrakesh,

187
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,644
Okay, Ava, Ava,
here's the, um...

188
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:30,448
Raphael, Brooklyn and I,
we really need to be alone.

189
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,650
So, um...

190
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,486
What you doing here?

191
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,921
Planting flowers.
I'm doing Gigi a favor.

192
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,624
My friend Carl is going to do a
shoot here in a couple of weeks.

193
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,526
Okay, Gigi, she didn't
tell me anything about this.

194
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,917
Don't worry about it. We're
the king of this castle.

195
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:44,863
Something wrong?

196
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,332
Here's the thing, Ava.
We're up here to write.

197
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,643
We've been contracted
to write a screenplay.

198
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,336
We have nine days to finish.

199
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:55,206
I'll be very quiet.
Like a mouse.

200
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,575
Like a mouse.

201
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,210
I'm staying out in the trailer.

202
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,979
Well, why you doing that?

203
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:01,808
Why not?

204
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:05,141
Okay, see. I just wanna
set the right tone.

205
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,752
The tone is set.

206
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,161
Now look.

207
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,762
That girl is very hot.

208
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,331
- I can see that.
- Just stay calm.

209
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,700
I can't control
the bitches worldwide.

210
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,837
Yeah, okay, this...
This is gonna be a problem.

211
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,706
- It's probably Karl Lagerfeld.
- What?

212
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,543
Why are we whispering?

213
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,432
What, what?

214
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,980
Her friend who's gonna shoot
here in a couple of weeks.

215
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,524
It's probably Karl Lagerfeld,
the famous designer.

216
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,911
Yes, I know who he is, bitch.

217
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,425
What are you guys
whispering about?

218
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,969
Ingmar Bergman.

219
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,941
I told you.

220
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,876
We don't trust something
about her, correct?

221
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,312
We don't trust something about anyone.
We're detectives.

222
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,680
Why hasn't she gone
to the police?

223
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,181
She wants to keep it
out of the paper.

224
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,784
Wants to use discretion doesn't
want anything to go on record.

225
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,119
She's got an aversion
to celebrity culture.

226
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,021
Are you guys going somewhere?

227
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,089
- Yeah.
- No.

228
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,657
Why?

229
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,728
You're sitting in your car. I was hoping
you could give me a lift to the store.

230
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,631
- We can't.
- Absolutely. Why not?

231
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,701
Okay, I'm gonna walk then.
Do you guys need anything?

232
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,738
- No, no thank you. We're cool.
- Do you want some Red Bull?

233
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,274
- Are you kidding?
- For the writing.

234
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,042
No we're keeping it clean.

235
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,911
Okay.

236
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,045
Bye.

237
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:50,321
Ava, can you get me some bittersweet
chocolate, some vanilla ice cream,

238
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,690
some cookies and maybe
some beef jerky.

239
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,968
Don't go crazy. Just
get one or the other.

240
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,661
Worry about yourself, damn!

241
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,963
Ava!

242
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,065
Just make it vanilla
swiss almond!

243
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,436
- Okay.
- And some condoms.

244
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,173
- I think you should fuck her.
- I'm absolutely not going to fuck her!

245
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,276
- It'll open you wide up.
- I'm here to write.

246
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,119
- I'm writing!
- You can do both.

247
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,016
- Are you drinking a Red Bull?
- It's Prosecco.

248
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,221
Mm, ugh. That's Red Bull.
Why would you drink that?

249
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:27,592
You wanna work all night? You
wanna be a big time writer?

250
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,061
Try something before
you dismiss it!

251
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,798
Put down the hand sanitizer
and get a little messy.

252
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,041
Gonna feel like a tarantula.

253
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,181
What the fuck was that?

254
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,498
Whoa! Gigi!

255
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,704
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
Are you okay? Are you all right?

256
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,740
Gigi, what're you...
Have you been drinking?

257
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,309
Have you... You're wasted!

258
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,511
Gi...

259
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,147
Raphael! Raphael.

260
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,516
- Raphael.
- Gigi!

261
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,127
What are you doing
for fun these days?

262
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,897
I don't know, stranger, what have
you been doing for fun these days.

263
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,900
Think we owe each other about
three happy new years.

264
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,371
- She drove here drunk.
- Oh, give it a rest!

265
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,608
I didn't drive anywhere. I stopped
for a second or something.

266
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,444
Can't you see she needs
taking care of, Dominic?

267
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,880
Aw you! You are in tune.

268
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,083
You simply tune in.
You always have.

269
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,618
Gigi!

270
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,958
My little darling!

271
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,129
Bring 'em more water please. The
last thing I want... Okay, wow.

272
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,934
Splish, splash,
I feel fantastic!

273
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,971
Dom, you wanna get in there
and make it a family affair?

274
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,842
I'm so happy we're all
here. It's wide open.

275
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,871
You guys have known each
other a while, right?

276
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:27,378
Yeah.

277
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,849
- Raphael was her boyfriend, sort of.
- What do you mean, sort of?

278
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,152
Whatever they were.
That was way back.

279
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,153
Hey!

280
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:39,624
Yes, it's true. Raph was
my boyfriend, sort of.

281
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,218
Speaking of, where's Wayne?

282
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:46,597
Don't mention Wayne, no
no, don't mention Wayne.

283
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,067
Why not, why?
What happened now?

284
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,872
He has some nerve.
That's all I'll say.

285
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,775
Raph and I have a lotta work
to do tonight so we might have...

286
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,278
Not a bubble bath
without some bubbly.

287
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,080
Yes!

288
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:07,151
- Please man.
- Why are you people ruining my life?

289
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,088
Because I love it when a man
brings me champagne!

290
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,091
The honey is flowing
in all directions!

291
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,606
Yeah, get up. Let's go.
We're leaving.

292
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,258
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

293
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,895
- Why?
- Why do you think?

294
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,204
Dominic. Dominic!

295
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,406
- What?
- I was losing my mind!

296
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,892
You can't leave, I
practically crashed the car

297
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:07,111
into the house last night.
I drove drunk.

298
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,780
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time.

299
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,521
Get off!

300
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,363
I don't wanna be
alone right now.

301
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,331
Well I do!

302
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,070
- G, stop it.
- Why can't you stay?

303
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,775
- Because, I need to focus!
- So focus!

304
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,810
It's a really big house.

305
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:42,933
Do you like that?

306
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:46,417
I need you! I might be
at the end of a rope.

307
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,586
Fine, all right, I'll stay!

308
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,322
Savage!

309
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,535
- Gorilla.
- Pussy!

310
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,607
What's up with my brother,
what are you feeding him?

311
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,176
Roast turkey and Miles
Davis of course.

312
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,870
Had a dream about
you last night, G.

313
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,389
That sounds promising.

314
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,828
You were telling me you wanted to
sell your shadow for 60 dollars.

315
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,236
- I could get more than 60 bucks.
- I bet you could.

316
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,471
Hey would you mind
reading this with me?

317
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,748
I'm tired of my shadow
pinpointing exactly where I am.

318
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,984
I'm not sure that I follow.

319
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,518
I want to be rid of it.

320
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,622
It's not that simple, lady.

321
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,857
Neither am I.

322
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,426
There's no turning back,
you understand?

323
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,868
Someone else could find
a better use for it.

324
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,831
It got a little complicated...

325
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,371
Missed you.

326
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:17,541
Change of plans.
We're not leaving.

327
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:22,713
So, upstairs in five, back to work.
Is this hot?

328
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:27,385
G, just so you know, you fucked up
my rib, really bad. It's killing me.

329
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:31,422
- Let's go. Back to work.
- So...

330
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,762
you write and then you dream,
or you dream and then you write?

331
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,465
- Which comes first?
- I dunno, that's a good question.

332
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,402
Sometimes I think
the dream is writing me.

333
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,181
So if we find her, why
don't we bring her back?

334
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:58,649
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

335
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,518
Because if we bring her
back, the movie ends.

336
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,254
I'm not so sure about that,
I'm not sure at all.

337
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,122
What's so special
about this cult?

338
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,738
Primary colors, Stanley
the dog, abandoned peers.

339
00:22:08,764 --> 00:22:11,195
Keep that close,
abandoned peers.

340
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:15,666
Trans-cranial
magnetic stimulation.

341
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,435
Grapefruit the size
of cannonballs.

342
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:22,907
The realism of nature combined with the
serial-ism of nature, aka, whimsy. Aha!

343
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,375
What?

344
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:28,653
Carlos Puyol beats Real
Madrid with his head.

345
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,047
With his head!

346
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,704
Raph, Raph, Raph. What?
Okay, what is all that?

347
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,418
Where you going with all this?

348
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,555
You see how quickly
young Ava dropped her robe?

349
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,024
You gotta love a girl who
can think on her feet, huh?

350
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,394
If you're a man with sight, you'll
notice she had a little fur down there.

351
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,997
I've been wondering for some time now if
the kids have been bringing bush back.

352
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,000
<i>Kojak</i> has been ruling
the area for a long time now.

353
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:53,037
Back in the day, your sister
had a full on Joan Baez.

354
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,574
- Okay, stop, stop. Please, stop!
- What? What?

355
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,910
These are my notes.

356
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,079
These are things that
can spark my vision.

357
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,782
We have to stick with it
to get somewhere.

358
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:09,854
I need to circle the muse. I need to let
the character emerge. I'm not a machine!

359
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:14,258
You need to circle. You seem
to circle a lotta things.

360
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,594
Oh, I see what's
happening here.

361
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,630
I'm just saying man,
sometimes, you gotta push.

362
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:24,301
Man, you gotta jump!

363
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,637
All right! Okay! All right!

364
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:30,908
Just forget it, forget it! Back to
the story, okay? Back to the story.

365
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,678
Just give me something real man,
something deep, something truthful!

366
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,791
Oh, it rubs me the wrong way
when you say deep, and truth.

367
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,951
It just rubs me the wrong way!

368
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:44,655
The guy who wants success in ten days.
The guy who wants everything now.

369
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,224
That guy's gonna talk to me
about truth, about death?

370
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,693
- You don't wanna get in there.
- Get in where, get in where?

371
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,263
You're just saying words, I dunno
what you're talking about!

372
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,698
This is the omphalos
of the entire story.

373
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,135
- The omphalos?
- The navel, the central point?

374
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,837
Fuck you, word of the day.

375
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,756
You gotta be kidding.

376
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,301
Dark, Mediterranean man
sits at his computer,

377
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,436
a pensive look on his face.

378
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:36,173
- Hi, Ava.
- The curious girl enters the room.

379
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,374
Hey, look, Ava, you're a
really nice girl, but

380
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,882
I thought you were gonna
be quiet as a mouse.

381
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,653
His brow tightens, she offers him a drink.
This is for you.

382
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,964
No, I wasn't. I was
just waving to you and I was...

383
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,733
Look at those two.
They can't resist.

384
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,338
- How's the writing?
- I'm stuck.

385
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,240
On what?

386
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,279
Um, in...

387
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,748
In the story, my
character's hired to

388
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,984
find this girl who's
wrapped up in a cult.

389
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:23,654
I find her, I don't know what happens next.
She's in some kind of trouble.

390
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,957
Well, I know all about trouble.

391
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,194
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

392
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,364
Well, what kind of trouble
have you been wrapped up in?

393
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,799
It depends how
you define trouble.

394
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,670
Sometimes trouble
give you the answers.

395
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,875
Maybe your character
is conflicted.

396
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:51,515
This girl is drawn to you. She's involved
in something that intrigues you.

397
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,652
Question is, do you explore it?

398
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,529
Or maybe he's falling for her.

399
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,965
Anyway, if you get stuck
again, give me a holler.

400
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:54,244
So he buys me this
'66 Barracuda Fastback.

401
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,481
Pearl white, burgundy bucket
seats, I love it.

402
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,049
- And Wayne loves it.
- I love it.

403
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:02,486
For about a week. And then the
next week he's just in his shell.

404
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:06,630
He's curled up, he won't get
out of bed, and he's angry.

405
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:08,592
So angry about everything!

406
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,061
Then suddenly decides he
wants to get rid of it.

407
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,663
- What!
- Not just the car.

408
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,265
He's suddenly obsessed
with the Ramapough Indians.

409
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:19,570
- To what end, I have no idea!
- Is that a new thing?

410
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:22,786
He's riding the Staten Island
ferry back and forth. He's

411
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:25,943
not going to Staten Island,
he's just riding the ferry.

412
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,545
Says he needs
to stay on the water.

413
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,681
I don't know what's
going on with him.

414
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,315
Maybe it's everything going
on in the world right now.

415
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,085
Maybe that's what's
setting him off.

416
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,521
- Yeah.
- I dunno.

417
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,957
We were so good for so long.

418
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,630
- And now, we're not connected.
- Not working.

419
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:49,166
I feel like he's bamboozling
me, unless maybe it's me.

420
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,368
- No it's not.
- No, my man is fucked up.

421
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,274
I'm sorry, G. I love you, but he's got
some serious issues. He was in a war.

422
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:00,077
Then he was fucking Team Six.

423
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,646
- What's Team Six?
- It means he was elite.

424
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,281
Okay, the best at what he did.

425
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:09,520
Anything after that, it has to feel
like a let down to some degree.

426
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,689
- She's no let down!
- Yeah man.

427
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,613
No, you know what I mean.
I don't mean that. It's

428
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,594
just that now he's a...
he's a glorified handyman.

429
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:22,633
Let's not glorify the fact that Wayne is a
product of the military industrial complex.

430
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:26,837
It's sad, but he made choices.
What I know,

431
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,975
is Gigi here is a radiant sunflower.
And one who appreciates the sun,

432
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,377
certainly loves sunflowers.

433
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,850
You're in love with him.
It's really simple.

434
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,823
Battle of the sexes,
people. Men in the lead.

435
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,891
All right, let's do it.
Let's go. I'll play around.

436
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,227
- On the case.
- I'll play around, here.

437
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,662
Get this going.

438
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,697
- Billie Jean gonna go down.
- I remember how to do this.

439
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,899
Oh, yeah. Dominic is on fire.

440
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,203
Winning does make you feel good.
I haven't won in a while.

441
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:00,437
Wait a second.

442
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,840
Winning is all. Chiang
Kai-shek, remember that.

443
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,209
This is it. This is
how it should be.

444
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,445
Friendship is as important as
romantic love, remember that.

445
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,116
The cards are life. Minnesota
Fats, remember that.

446
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,986
It's all in the sauce.

447
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,033
Listen, Raph, here it is.
I've got pages man,

448
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,990
exciting stuff. This
is what happens, okay?

449
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,793
Our girl, she's running
from everything, you know?

450
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:26,797
Her family, society, the status
quo's, all getting ripped out.

451
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,706
She's found a new life with this
cult, and I'll tell you this much.

452
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:31,502
It is beautiful and I
am wide open to it.

453
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:34,505

- - I think you're out.

454
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,508
I'm out.

455
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,977

You're mine. You're mine.

457
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:52,523
Hey, hey, watch out. Okay,

458
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,185
<i>Don't be a sap, Renee.</i>

459
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:25,548
You dummy up on me now, you're
looking at 99 years in Cincy.

460
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,192
Where'd you stash the dame?

461
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,560
I'm not telling you
where she is.

462
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,164
I don't see that you have
much of a choice, bucko.

463
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,166
You wouldn't understand.

464
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,014
Try me.

465
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,941
She told me about the light.

466
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:48,145
- I'm not talking about a street lamp.
- Yeah.

467
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:54,651
A light? You getting
sucked into her cult.

468
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,621
I'll be lookin' for you next.

469
00:30:57,623 --> 00:31:01,291
- You may not find me.
- Wonderful, wonderful!

470
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,357
- Wonderful scenes you've written.
I love it

471
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:04,228
- It's good right?

472
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,966
I can't see him right now. You gotta...
You gotta stall him. Make him go away.

473
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,667
Something! Okay?

474
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,376
Yo, dude! What's up, man?

477
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,650
- I dunno.
- Oh, cool.

478
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,086
- What does Gigi want?
- She wants me to be cool.

479
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,255
Cool, man, so just stay

480
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:36,593
Smoke this, dude. Chill out, when

481
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,629

Look who it is. Holy shit.

488
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,392
I didn't know you were
going to fucking be here.

489
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,184
What're you doing?

490
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,553
I'm up here with Dominic,

491
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,055

- Yeah, I still got the curse.

493
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:46,296
Well, you still look like a movie star.
You get botox yet?

494
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,368
These are new. Saw Dom
on <i> Law and Order.</i>

495
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,305
Got his ear cut off. He was
being such a pussy about it.

496
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,940
You still working at the bar?

497
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,776
Yeah, I'm still working
at the bar.

498
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:03,439
I gotta take care of some
stuff with G, so, um...

499
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,782

500
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,984
Yeah?

501
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,719
She mentioned you guys
had a little blow off.

502
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,698
She did?

503
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,681
You know, just in passing.

504
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,038
Thought maybe you'd
wanna go get some flowers,

505
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,540

Clark Gable style.

506
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,010
Oh, is that what you think?

507
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,880
Well, all we have up
here is flowers.

508
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,235
I guess I'm the flowers.

511
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:48,392
You know that? You know that she's in bed?
How do you know that she's in bed?

512
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,935
How do you know
she's still in bed?

513
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,713
You got a lotta information.

514
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:08,045
Just up here riding with Dom,

515
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,346
You said that.

516
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:22,559
- Runs good, don't it.

517
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,029
Hey, man, you haven't

Thanks, man, thanks.

522
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,867
You know, what's going on? I
thought you were driving to L.A?

523
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,670
Dude, so did I. We got to
Ohio and Wayne pulled a 180.

524
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:10,407
- Wants to work it out with Gigi
- How long you gonna stay, you think?

525
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,409
Dude, I dunno. Could be a while.

526
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,236
Hey can you do me a favor?
There's a black

527
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:16,146
bag in there, it's Wayne's.
Can you grab it?

528
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:19,549
- Just in the back, dude.
- Yeah, no I got it.

529
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,619
- What is this?
- Oh, bro, that's my head shot man.

530
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,556
- What do you need a head shot for?
- Oh, it's for my show.

531
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,158
What show?

532
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,388
You didn't hear it, dude?
I got my own show.

533
00:35:30,414 --> 00:35:31,428
Wayne's such a dick!

534
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,965
- I don't get it.
- Dude, I don't get it either, bro.

535
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,735
I'm just teaching my class at
Point Pleasant one day, surfing

536
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,071
It's like the best day

"Hey, bro, I've been watching you."

539
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,673
And I'm like "Hey, bro, what
the fuck, man?" Because

540
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:51,648
I thought he was trying

548
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,843
I'm like "Okay, dude,

549
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,702
because I thought it
was Vasper calling.

550
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,505
Dude, it was really Jerry Bruckheimer,
he called me up, he was like

551
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,408
"Hey, man, I want you to come in,
I want to talk about your show."

552
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,678
So I go in and sit down with him, dude.

I'm like "Hey man", you know?

555
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,321
"Is everything cool here?" and he's
like "Yeah, everything is cool here."

Gigi hasn't been picking up
my calls for a few days, so...

597
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,767

- Is she gonna break up with me?

601
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,452
Wayne, I dunno what she's gonna do.
I really don't know.

602
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,887
It's just, I'm up here,
I'm trying to work

603
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,170
Yeah, that's what Raph said.

604
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,792
You guys are working up here.

605
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,062
I didn't know you were gonna be up here you
know, so it was a little bit of a surprise.

606
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,354
Well, I told G, you know.

607
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,400
What are you guys doing
here, what's Raph doing here?

608
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:34,070
He's writing a script with me. We're
trying to write a screenplay.

609
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,507
About what?

610
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,145
It's about some fucked up, you know,
like some noir stuff. Some...

611
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,385
missing people, and things...

612
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:45,648
That's cool, man, I'm
not gonna get in the way.

613
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,419
I just wanted to see G man. I don't know
if she's been picking up my calls...

614
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,341
But I'm here to make it
cool, you know. It's

615
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,390
cool, I mean is she cool?
You think she's cool?

616
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:56,226
- What do you think?
- You think she's being uncool?

617
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,331
- I'm asking you a question. Can you focus?
- Okay.

618
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:05,502
I'm saying that I'm cool, and
I'm wondering if she's cool.

619
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,139
- Is she cool?
- She's gonna come back.

620
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,441
I'm just asking if she's cool.

621
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,710
She's been normal.

622
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:17,480
Are you not hearing what I'm saying?
I'm just asking is she cool.

623
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,150
I dunno, I mean, I'm not sure
what we're talking about.

624
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,732
Don't worry about it.

625
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,259
Where's my bag?

626
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,061
- Huh?
- Where's my bag?

627
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,399
I dunno... Maybe...

628
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,171
- Maybe that's it there.
- What's it doing over there?

629
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:47,010
- What's it doing over here?
- I have no idea.

630
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,480
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about that.
I didn't mean to... You okay?

631
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,148
Yeah, I'm good.

632
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,492
All right, see you
later, Wayne.

633
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,736
It's just we're
being pushed out!

634
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:17,407
- It's a reality surfer show, so what?
- So what?

635
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:19,242
It starts with a
stupid surfer show,

636
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:23,646
or Idol,<i> Top Model,</i> then your Jennifer
Hudson winning a fucking oscar!

637
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,848
Do you wanna work?

638
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,785
- But you act like you don't care!
- I don't care?

639
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:33,756
I don't know, just... What
are we missing? What?

640
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,861
- Maybe, Devon... maybe he just has 'it'.
- Definitely has 'Id'.

641
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:41,464
- So you agree, he has 'it'?
- He's a beach bum, he's a pleasure seeker.

642
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,533
What does that have
to do with having 'it'?

643
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,001
Having 'it'?

644
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,136
- That's what the fuck I'm talking about!
- Thought you meant 'Id'.

645
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:51,207
Do you think he has that something special?
Jesus Christ, Raph.

646
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,043
I wouldn't go so far as
to say <i>Endless Summer,</i>

647
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,346
has 'it', whatever
that is exactly.

648
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,762
Maybe people are seeing
something in him, that they

649
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:01,084
just don't see in us, and
that something is 'it'.

650
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:04,454
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- He's on TV, we're not!

651
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:06,656
He's got a big agent, we don't.

652
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,726
I bet you, in a year, he's doing
a war film with Ed Harris,

653
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:14,364
and you and I are still shaking Cosmos in
Brooklyn, talking about Bertolt Brecht.

654
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:22,038
I'm not gonna change my philosophy for
living because Devon got a reality TV show.

655
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:29,846
Come on! Okay, so what is this so
called philosophy for living, Raph?

656
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,448
Because the last I looked, you
were a 40 year old bartender.

657
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,551
I don't give a
motherfuck about<i> Idol!</i>

658
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,086
I don't give a motherfuck
about Jennifer Hudson,

659
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,622
surfing, 'it', or whatever
you're talking about!

660
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,457
Now I wanna end
this conversation.

661
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,493
Either you're doing
something wrong,

662
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:49,499
or you're doing everything right. That
could mean that you just don't have 'it'.

663
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:54,504
If you have talent, if you have
real talent, you don't question it,

664
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:57,659
and people that constantly
question it, are the

665
00:42:57,685 --> 00:43:00,969
mediocre ones, and that's what you are.
Mediocre.

666
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,868
Is that how you
really feel about me?

667
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,223
I mean, is that
how you really feel?

668
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,759
- You're doing it right now!
- What? I'm doing what?

669
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,194
You're begging approval.

670
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:22,332
You have this pathetic need for
validation, look at you. Even from me.

671
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,668
Even from me, the 40
year old bartender.

672
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,004
Well, at least I'm putting
myself out there.

673
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:31,185
At least I'm going for something.
You know what,

674
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:33,910
that takes courage.
You're doing nothing!

675
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:38,548
You've become a novelty act,
and I'll tell you something,

676
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,983
you're kidding yourself
if you think my sister

677
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:43,544
would ever have a serious
relationship with you.

678
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,789
You're an entertainment.

679
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,828
No one we know takes
you seriously. No one.

680
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,399
You're a fucking joke.

681
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:43,146
Should take a blowtorch
to this fucking place.

682
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:46,662
Dude, there's some chick
out here, bro, it's

683
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:50,019
like a mirage. She's
so fucking hot, dude.

684
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:55,725
- You know her?
- That's Ava. She used to work for Gigi.

685
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,394
You're not gonna land her the
way you do those L.A skanks.

686
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,697
Couple of tiki drinks
with some coke.

687
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,799
Dude, nobody drinks
tiki drinks.

688
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,409
Do you think
I can fuck her, bro?

689
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:15,752
See all this stuff out here?
See all this?

690
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:16,738
Yeah.

691
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,175
It's my stuff. Gigi put
all my stuff out here.

692
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:22,944
Wanna bring it back in?

693
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,723
She thinks it's over,
she's wrong.

694
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:31,394
Well, do you think, there's
a chance it might be?

695
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,696
Might be what?

696
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,202
- Over, dude.
- Come here.

697
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:42,405
- What?
- Come here.

698
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,675
- Come on, man. What did I do, dude?
- Come here.

699
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,881
- Come here.
- What? What are you doing?

700
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:55,318
- Nothing man.
- Nothing? What are you doing? Hey.

701
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,753
- Hey.
- Hey.

702
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:57,820
- Hey.
- Hey.

703
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,323
- Hey.
- Why?

704
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:01,072
Why?

705
00:46:01,098 --> 00:46:04,060
What are you doing, man?
What are you doing, stop.

706
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:07,563
- What are you prepared to do?
- No, Wayne, don't get yourself worked up.

707
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,266
- Is God big and white?
- Don't get yourself worked up.

708
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,136
- Do you believe in the Pope?
- Chill out, stay in the pocket.

709
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:16,339
I'm in the pocket.
You in the pocket?

710
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:19,254
You want the same shit to happen
that happened in the city?

711
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,735
You want that to happen here?

712
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,513
Do you?

713
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,582
Do you, man?

714
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:29,719
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

715
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,121
- I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah, me too, man.

716
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,593
Hey, tell me this. She 18?

717
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,360
- Hey.
- Hi.

718
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,462
What's happening?

719
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:16,866
- You look nice and comfy.
- I feel comfy.

720
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,770
- You know Wayne?
- I do.

721
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,139
I'm his brother, Devon.

722
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,976
- You're Ava.
- I am.

723
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,079
Hey.

724
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:35,251
Welcome to our illustrious country
home, Wayne's brother, Devon.

725
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,258
I surf.

726
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,962
Cool. Professionally?

727
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:49,746
Yeah, but that's not all I do.
I'm a philanthropist.

728
00:47:49,772 --> 00:47:51,601
Got my own clothing line.

729
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,470
Devon, Devon!

730
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,773
I gotta get in the pocket man.
Gimme your car keys.

731
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:59,842
Oh, they're in the visor.

732
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:10,720
He's fine. So, like,
what do you do?

733
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,890
What are you a professional at?

734
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,626
Wayne said you're
en entrepreneur?

735
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,062
Did I just see Wayne
drive down the road?

736
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,865
Yeah, he just took a drive
to get his head straight.

737
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,805
- Hi, Dev.
- Hey, G.

738
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:32,742
Just met Ava.
She's very pretty.

739
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,579
You know...

740
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,548
Wayne really wants
to work it out with you.

741
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,630
He's trying, you know,
he's really trying.

742
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:49,650
He's crazy.

743
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,469
Izzy, I didn't get your messages.
The service is in and out up here.

744
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,906
<i>I had to go to the emergency animal
hospital, all night with him.</i>

745
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:06,542
- <i> All night and...</i>
- The service is bad. If I knew...

746
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,346
Of course I would have called you if I
knew Benny hurt his eye, I mean, what...

747
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:15,184
Just tell me what's... What happened?
Tell me what happened? Is he okay?

748
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:19,789
<i>I don't wanna talk to you until you're done
writing this screenplay, or whatever it is.</i>

749
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,259
Are you serious? Are you seriously
doing this to me right now?

750
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,516
Can you put Benny on speaker phone?
I wanna talk to him.

751
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:26,228
No, no, , no.

752
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,166
<i>That's ridiculous. I'm not putting
your dog on speaker phone.</i>

753
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:33,035
Izz? Izzy, are you there?

754
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,505
- You okay?
- Jesus!

755
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:39,452
Devon, you just scared
the shit out of me.

756
00:49:39,478 --> 00:49:41,644
All right, dude, chill out.

757
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,113
We're in a country.
It's illustrious here.

758
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:59,729
- How you doing, babe?
- What the hell?

759
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:00,950
What happened to you?

760
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:04,433
Me and your brother getting
down at the deeper truths.

761
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,795
How's it going
with you and Wayne?

762
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,638
- I haven't seen him yet.
- Yeah?

763
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,675
Well, if you need me,
you shoot up a flare, okay?

764
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,977
You still got it!

765
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:18,547
Look, I'm throwing a goddamn party
here tonight, lighting this place up.

766
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:22,077
You got an old suit in
that collection for me?

767
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,953
A party? Yeah, sure.

768
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,222
- I have a suit, of course.
- Okay, good.

769
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,197
- You smell that night jasmine, do you?
- Yeah, I smell it.

770
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:43,172
Be cool, Raph. Okay?
Just be cool.

771
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,155
Hold up, broheim.

772
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:02,291
What's up superstar, I heard
about your show. Congrats.

773
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,161
Thanks, friend. Nice ride.

774
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,830
What do you want, Dev?

775
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,800
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the store.

776
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,602
Are you gonna get
something for Gigi?

777
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,956
I'm gonna get something
for everybody you want

778
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:18,232
me to pick you up a nice
Rose there, Venice?

779
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,378
Your eyes, my eyes.

780
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:28,317
Your eyes, my eyes, bro.
I'm watching you. All day.

781
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,328
Hi.

782
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,897
Hi, Devon.

783
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,420
- Hello?
<i>- What're you doing?</i>

784
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,191
I'm thinking.

785
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,398
<i>What's all that noise?</i>

786
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,871
- Cooking.
- <i> Mm, what're you cooking?</i>

787
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,376
Everything.

788
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:28,944
<i>- Sauce?</i>
<i>- </i> Yeah.

789
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,113
<i>Polenta?</i>

790
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,315
- Mm hm.
- <i> Nice.</i>

791
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,052
<i>Lamb?</i>

792
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,925
- What do you want?
- <i> Come around the corner, by the pond.</i>

793
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,801
Hey, how's the sauce?

794
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:58,607
- Good. What're those?
- Would you like to have a seat?

795
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,242
Where'd you get 'em?
Did you take them?

796
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:03,279
Don't worry about where I got 'em.
Just sit down, please?

797
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:04,780
I wanna talk.

798
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:06,977
Did you take those chairs
from somebody's porch?

799
00:53:07,003 --> 00:53:07,917
I borrowed them.

800
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:09,852
Just bring 'em back, Jesus.

801
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,420
I thought we could sit
down and talk and be nice.

802
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:12,454
What you being so uptight about?

803
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:15,391
- You asked me to marry you!
- How is that a bad thing?

804
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,692
I don't see how this is a bad...

805
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,260
How and when you did
it is the bad thing.

806
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:21,263
And then you just took off?
That's a bad thing!

807
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,203
- I mean what were you thinking?
- I don't know.

808
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:35,311
My head was fucked up, okay, but I've
been thinking about this for a long time.

809
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,785
Jesus Christ, Wayne.

810
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:41,350
Jesus Christ what? What do
you want from me? I love you.

811
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,018
I wanna marry you.

812
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:47,790
Where are you going? Don't you
think I know what's wrong with me?

813
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:51,360
Please, come back.
Please, come back here.

814
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:56,332
I got something for you. It's an anger
card, just for you to... Sit down.

815
00:53:56,334 --> 00:54:01,070
- Babe, sit down.
- Hey, I don't wanna sit.

816
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:04,083
"There's nothing really
worth getting angry about.

817
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:06,233
What're you angry
about this time?"

818
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,780
- Are you asking me this? I don't get it.
- No that's to myself.

819
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:15,097
I've been carrying that
around for a few weeks now.

820
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:16,819
I write stuff down that...

821
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:17,768
Triggers?

822
00:54:17,794 --> 00:54:21,582
Yeah! More I write it out,
more I can start to see the...

823
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,496
- Patterns?
- Patterns.

824
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,266
And then I can start to figure
some of that shit out.

825
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,503
Okay. This is very
evolved for you.

826
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,486
Is this some kind of trick?

827
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,377
What do you think?
No, it's not a trick.

828
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,180
Okay, it's a trick.
You're being tricked.

829
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,850
"Lights."

830
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:50,185
Yeah? Okay, I know that one.

831
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,756
"Bruni the super?"

832
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:58,093
- Yeah, that fucking guy.
- Well, I know. Me too, for that matter.

833
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,597
Rain...

834
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,932
Rain gets you mad?

835
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:09,171
No, not the rain. Umbrellas. People aren't
careful you could get your eye poked out.

836
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:13,742
They could easily lift it up, or tilt it.
They don't fucking do that.

837
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,178
Get poked with
a fucking umbrella.

838
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,983
I don't see anything on here
about the Barracuda.

839
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,758
Are you listening, are
you really reading this?

840
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:25,954
I'm working my way
up to the big one.

841
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:29,787
Why would you wait till
now to give me this?

842
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:33,387
After you've caused
all these problems...

843
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,468
You do something like this, and then
you propose, that's reasonable.

844
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,404
But, not on the heels
of a huge argument.

845
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,907
And then you...

846
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:48,010
<i>¶ Did you ever see a dream</i>
<i>walking? ¶</i>

847
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,079
<i>¶ Well, I did ¶</i>

848
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:54,917
<i>¶ Did you ever see a dream</i>
<i>talking? ¶</i>

849
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:56,585
<i>¶ Well, I did ¶</i>

850
00:55:56,587 --> 00:56:00,022
<i>¶ Did you ever see heaven</i>
<i>right in your arms? ¶</i>

851
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,424
<i>¶ Saying I love you, I do ¶</i>

852
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:03,726
Stop it!

853
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:05,961
Well the dream that
was walking, I...

854
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,529
That was a little high.

855
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,701
- Stop. Stop!

856
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,871
I love you...

857
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,775
I didn't want you to leave.
I never want you to leave.

858
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,831
But you're always
fucking leaving.

859
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:29,418
I'm working on it, baby. What do
you think the card's all about?

860
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,222
I don't wanna leave. I don't
want you to leave either.

861
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,694
Let's get married.

862
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:43,732
- Oh, my God!
- What, oh, my God?

863
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,436
I can't believe
you did it again!

864
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,572
- What am I doing?
- You're not getting it.

865
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,728
<i>Dominic! Hey, it's me, Kaplan.
Listen, bad news,</i>

866
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:28,577
<i>the money went away
for a little project.</i>

867
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:31,146
<i>So, I won't be</i>
<i>needing your script.</i>

868
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,308
<i>But hey, these things
happen, you know, so,</i>

869
00:57:33,334 --> 00:57:35,517
<i>you gotta stick it out.
The money was there,</i>

870
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,520
<i>now it's not. It's very
frustrating, but what can you do?</i>

871
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:41,657
<i>Okay, take care, babe.</i>
<i>I gotta go. Bye.</i>

872
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:47,996
Fuck.

873
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:08,083
You were crying.
Why were you crying?

874
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,118
Because they sliced
my ear off, dude.

875
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,665
But that's not what would happen.
That's blunt trauma.

876
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:14,423
You would go into
shock or something.

877
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:16,758
You've never had your ear cut off.
How the fuck do you know?

878
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,094
No, but I've been shot. Got a
piece of shrapnel on my thigh,

879
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:21,103
seen my buddies get their
fingers blown off.

880
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,065
That's not what happens.
You go into shock.

881
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:26,201
This guy, it was very close
to my head, man.

882
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,758
It hit nerves and shit.

883
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:31,273
What about playing like
an interior decorator?

884
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:35,077
Or maybe like a hairdresser?

885
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,813
Stop it. Come on, Wayne.

886
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,582
- Wanna do a shot?
- Yes.

887
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,326
Let's go out.

888
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,090
Cheers, bro!

889
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,258
Cheers!

890
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,093
I want you, right there.
You, give me...

891
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:33,735
<i>Check, check, check!</i>

892
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:37,573
<i>DJ Fluxus is gonna juxt your
whole position, people.</i>

893
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,975
<i>Everyone back down</i>
<i>on the dance floor.</i>

894
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,677
Let's do it.

895
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:08,397
Listen to me, you're my everything.
You're all that means anything to me.

896
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:13,502
You're my ice cream sundae,
you understand. You get me?

897
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,774
Why don't we go to Niagara
Falls and have a honeymoon?

898
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,210
- Hey.
- Hey.

899
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:27,282
Hi! Those were seriously
some good dance moves.

900
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:30,285
- You too!
- Thanks.

901
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:34,790
Cold water doesn't bother me. I can
keep my hand in there all night.

902
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,625
Maybe you should do that.

903
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,765
Ah. No.

904
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,635
Sorry.

905
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:49,471
Whoa, what the fuck?
You're not into this?

906
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,485
- Come here.
- What? Oh.

907
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:20,435
<i>Everybody on the dance</i>
<i>floor. Everybody, come down.</i>

908
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:24,473
We do the honeymoon now, and if that
goes well, we can get married later.

909
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,541
- Know what I mean?
- I like that.

910
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:30,045
And if we get really crazy,
we could drive to Canada.

911
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:32,647
Keep on driving to Montreal.

912
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:35,717
Is that something you wanna do?
Don't you wanna do that?

913
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,520
Do you wanna do that?

914
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,192
What?

915
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:46,895
Look I'm sorry,
it's just, you know, I...

916
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,663
Have a girlfriend.

917
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,835
That's not what
I'm talking about.

918
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,444
All right, okay, okay, next.

919
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,380
You know what the main ingredient
of the marshmallow is?

920
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,249
- Sugar!
- No.

921
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,718
- Horse?
- Cocaine?

922
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,154
- No. What?
- Horse... horse hoof.

923
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:14,022
- Hooves, hooves!
- Oh, my God.

924
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,697
Politics. Politics
people, politics.

925
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:25,600
All right, last one. Who's
on the 500 dollar bill?

926
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:29,271
William McKinley. William McKinley.
William McKinley.

927
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:31,807
- Bitches.
- Who the fuck knows that?

928
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:34,234
No one. That's the point.
William McKinley was a fucking

929
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,745
president of the United States
and no one knows who he is.

930
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:39,742
Everybody knows who Washington is.
Lincoln, fucking Ben

931
01:03:39,768 --> 01:03:42,684
Franklin wasn't even president
and he's on some money.

932
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:45,554
But what the fuck did
William McKinley do?

933
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:49,024
- He got assassinated.
- He did get assassinated.

934
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:51,193
- Does anybody know?
- He was President?

935
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:52,610
I've never even heard of him.

936
01:03:52,636 --> 01:03:55,197
They don't even make 500
dollar bills any more.

937
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,998
What's your point?

938
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,069
My point is, McKinley
never made his mark.

939
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,804
Oh.

940
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:06,308
- So you're a man on a mission.
- Yeah, I'm a man on a mission.

941
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,610
You know, I wanna make a mark.

942
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,079
What then?

943
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:18,286
I don't know. That's it. I get to
live my life doing what I love.

944
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,957
Again, and again and again,
and again.

945
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:25,427
And then we die, and then
it's over and who cares?

946
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,529
We're all fucking
just bacteria, dude.

947
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:34,870
Why are you so caught
up in making a mark for?

948
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:38,540
I wake up every
morning with this...

949
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,823
pain in my stomach like
I did something wrong.

950
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:44,571
I don't wanna feel
that shit any more.

951
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,782
Shame.

952
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:49,985
I don't know what it is but
I don't wanna feel it.

953
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:52,220
Was talking about
self-loathing. Shame.

954
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,594
You gotta look to it man.

955
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,698
Everything else will come.

956
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,203
I don't know...

957
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,539
But you do know.

958
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:17,812
It's exactly that. The weight of all this
stuff gets lifted when you embrace love.

959
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:21,383
All of this other
stuff is real.

960
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:24,953
But it's good to align
yourself with love. It helps.

961
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,157
What's the point,
if we don't have love?

962
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,326
Yeah.

963
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:33,094
Why are we here?

964
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:40,902
Yeah, dude, love. Riding high energy.
When I surf, I feel love.

965
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:45,140
A wave is like a wavelength
of energy. It's moving water

966
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:48,777
and I'm riding the surface.
Dude, think about that!

967
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:53,682
I'm in perfect harmony with
mother nature when I'm surfing.

968
01:05:53,684 --> 01:05:56,551
- That's amazing!
- That is amazing.

969
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,023
I love Gigi.

970
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,860
I love Gigi too.

971
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,230
I love you.

972
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,399
Take it easy, tiger.
She loves you too.

973
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:14,002
I'm serious.

974
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:19,107
- I love you too.
- Here have a marshmallow.

975
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:23,745
Love is a giant pickle.

976
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,949
I'm in love with you.

977
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:34,589
These people, they don't know what we're
talking about. I'm in love with you.

978
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:38,259
Wayne, I'm sorry you have to hear this.
I got nothing against you.

979
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,835
There's something alive
here between Gigi and me.

980
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,571
Right.

981
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:52,407
Remember back in the
day, you wanted to drive

982
01:06:52,433 --> 01:06:54,834
down the Pan-American
highway with me?

983
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,812
Remember that?

984
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:01,334
You wanted to drive all the
way down there with me?

985
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,285
But I wasn't ready.

986
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,658
- These last few days have been so...
- Let's hear him out.

987
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:18,533
Gigi, I can love you like
you never, ever, ever...

988
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:24,672
Like earth, like magic. Just
meet me in my car at 4:00 a. m..

989
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:28,943
You don't bring anything.
We gonna make that drive.

990
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,638
Hey, Dev, you're
in the wrong car.

991
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,794
Sorry.

992
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,747
Good night.

993
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,544
What's up big boy?

994
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,376
You know, I like what you
guys have written so far.

995
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,079
Yeah, what do you
like about it?

996
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,322
I like that they fall in love.

997
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,822
Does she fall through
with the double cross?

998
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:30,144
Because that would be
heart breaking.

999
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,461
Would.

1000
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,620
Think she goes through
with the double cross?

1001
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,689
I absolutely do.
