2
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,847
Oh shit. Hey man, I gotta get to
Brooklyn, I gotta get to work,

3
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,617
open the bar, I gotta work on
this audition for the morning.

4
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,218
What're you going in on?

5
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,588
Now is this scene before or
after you saw your own leg off?

6
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,293
I've seen slaves breaking their
backs in the fields. Have you?

7
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:07,900
Pardon me, pardon me, I'm very sorry. No, we
should head out. We gotta be there at four.

8
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:13,605
That's enough, from both of you.
And you... wait. That's enough.

9
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,140
We need you up there, kid.

10
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,577
I'll be right up.

11
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,115
Brother, prepping an audition or doing an
audition, or resting from an audition.

12
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:27,686
You can never commit, because you never know, you
might get a job, but you never do get a job.

13
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,988
Sorry, but you don't.

14
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,494
Okay, who needs what?

15
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,697
These three here, we need two Ripostos one Fellini.

16
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,568
I don't know what he wants, and that
freak down there, I'm not certain.

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,704
Oh shit, is that Raphael?

18
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,174
I was a gay on the Woody Allen movie you did.

19
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,310
I'm gonna be right with you. Just kidding.

20
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:56,014
I knew you had a small part but you were great.
Thought you were gonna be huge!

21
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,182
What happened?

22
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,859
When I headed for that door I realized

23
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,895
if I went out, I would never come back.

24
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,198
I didn't want to never come back

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,037
but I couldn't come back out onto the stage, so

26
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,840
there wasn't anything left so I went up the ladder.

27
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,246
You're The King. The King. You're Joe Strummer.

28
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,381
- I'm Joe Strummer.
- You're a sonic producer.

29
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,717
I'm a sonic producer!

30
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,989
I think I liked it. If you don't mind
I wanna sit for the second scene.

31
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,925
Sure, no. What you did, really good.

32
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:44,196
Really good.
Very good, thanks.

33
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,038
<i>I don't know what else to tell you. You're in an age void.</i>

34
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,135
Would you like a Peroni?

35
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,571
I want you to change your attitude, chief.

36
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:56,475
I want you to ask me again, and this time, with a smile.

37
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,050
Go fuck yourself!
Get the fuck out!

38
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,086
Yeah, we will get the fuck out of here!

39
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:11,688
- Look at me, look at me.
- Dude I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna fucking kill someone.

40
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,202
- In an age void.
- What?

41
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,370
They don't know what to do with me. That's the problem.

42
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,373
Look, it's Lincoln Center.
It's a cultural superstore.

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:33,278
It's white boy business, I mean, you
getting that part is a long shot, come on!

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,914
Well what's the point then, Raph?

45
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,584
Please, tell me, I mean it's the same five directors,

46
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,986
the same 10 writers, the same 20 actors,

47
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,257
they just do everything! It's not good
for theaters, it's fucking boring.

48
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,726
Look, it's a tight circle, we're not part of it.

49
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:52,030
You know the days of Joe Papp, off the
street, the living theater, that's done!

50
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,466
Who's off the street?
I'm trained, well trained.

51
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,602
- I know you're trained.
- I went to conservatory!

52
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,705
Yeah but you didn't go to Juilliard, and
that's what this is all about, right?

53
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,742
What big shows you were in, who saw you do it,
my dad is Edward Albee, all that kind of stuff.

54
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,377
- Edward Albee doesn't have kids.
- I know.

55
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,346
- He's gay.
- Doesn't mean he doesn't have kids.

56
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,915
- But he doesn't.
- Hey, Dom! Who's this, your pimp?

57
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,216
Hey, how you doing, what a sight!

58
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,453
You look fantastic. Look who
it is, Kaplan!

59
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,689
Hey don't mind us. We were running a scene right now...

60
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:22,294
I can't believe I'm running into you maniacs,
you guys have been on my mind all week!

61
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,129
- Was it in a naughty way?
- Take it easy.

62
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,098
It's always a little naughty with you, Raphael.

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,133
Tell us the less naughty parts for now.

64
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,636
All right. That was an amazing
night at your bar last month.

65
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,505
We've had so many amazing nights
at the bar with you, Kaplan.

66
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,141
No, we were talking movies with
your writer friend, Jonathan.

67
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,810
- You had those leather pants on!
- We love those pants.

68
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:43,015
Wasn't Jonathan talking about doing some low
budget Raymond Chandler detective story thing?

69
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,584
- No.
- That was our idea.

70
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,919
Who was mentioning the <i>Sweet Smell of Success?</i>

71
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,588
- "Match me, Sidney"
- Match me.

72
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,392
I love that movie. What's Jonathan up to? I love his show.

73
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,361
Can you get me in touch? I promised my
boss I'd find something interesting

74
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,096
for him to produce for under 300 grand,

75
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,565
he's looking to shuffle some money
around on a tax credit thing.

76
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,736
I don't know what Jonathan' up
to, but we wrote that script.

77
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,805
- It's written, it's done.
- What script?

78
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,709
- The Raymond Chandler thing.
- We're burning down the cultural superstar rasta.

79
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:15,180
Wow, look at you guys, that's great.
Did you write parts for yourselves?

80
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,583
- Of course.
- Yeah, we're the leads. We play brothers.

81
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,979
Okay, well what's it about?

82
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,925
Don't be shy, Dominic.
Tell Kaplan what it's about.

83
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,861
It's, uh, well, basically, um...

84
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,497
- Well, we play brothers.
- Yeah, I got that.

85
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:37,002
And, you know, we own a detective agency.

86
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,771
- And it's a noir.
- Absolutely.

87
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,307
Uh, you know, basically...

88
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:47,913
Well, it's an elevated genre film. At least
that's how aunt Carrie described it.

89
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,549
- Aunt Carrie read it?
- Yeah, she loved it.

90
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,884
How the hell did you get aunt Carrie to read it?

91
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,486
- No offense.
- None taken.

92
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,189
- We know some people.
- Yeah, we're tapped in.

93
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,091
Well, what'd she say?

94
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,193
She said, er, what did she say, Raph?

95
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,228
- Said it was raw.
- Yeah, oh yeah.

96
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,131
She said it was really raw and original,

97
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,667
and that she'd love to get her hands on it.

98
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,635
It's called "The Blackmailers Don't Shoot."

99
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,871
- Or maybe "The Black Mask."
- Yeah, I like that one.

100
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,908
What the fuck, is it low budget? You guys
think you can make it for under 300 k?

101
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,578
- Oh, yeah.
- Super low. Really low.

102
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,513
- Less than that.
- This sounds perfect.

103
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:26,151
My boss is looking for something new.
I get to produce this project.

104
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,886
Show me the script, let's do this.

105
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,289
No wait, hold on a minute, you know...

106
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,558
We're doing rewrites, we're swamped, you know, we can't.

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,895
This money goes away in two weeks, we don't
have to jump through any hoops with them.

108
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,798
- I just need to see the script.
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,933
Look I get you guys, I always have.

110
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:47,005
I can give you ten days, that's it. But we're
meeting with other writers, so get it to me.

111
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,542
How you gonna get out of this.
We don't even know aunt Carrie.

112
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,144
I auditioned for her once.

113
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,748
- You can't write a script in ten days.
- Yes, but we can.

114
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,350
We, together.

115
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,787
Come on, we've been talking about doing this for years.

116
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,958
I have an idea. What do writers do?
They go to the country.

117
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,497
We'll go to the country. To my sister's house.
We'll have it all to ourselves.

118
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:16,501
Peace, quiet, no distractions...

119
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,805
Let's just get there, get down, and do it.

120
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,464
Photosynthesis baby.

121
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,469
Oh, I forgot how peaceful it is in the country.

122
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,241
Nature will flip you, Dominic.

123
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,279
Flip you for real, remember that.

124
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,486
Yeah!

125
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,369
Police activity,
people. stay back.

126
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,739
- Dominic, grab the bags.
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,881
That's very cute.
Very cute.

128
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,286
<i>To Gigi's country manor.</i>

129
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,392
- Starting tomorrow, I think we should cleanse it out.
- No booze.

130
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,627
I saw this documentary on Ingmar Bergman

131
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,663
- at the Film Forum.
- I love the Film Forum.

132
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:28,300
He said the demons want you to stay in bed with cold feet.

133
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:33,238
So the first thing he does is he gets
up in the morning and he takes a walk.

134
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,607
And then he writes.

135
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,083
You want some gross character of a woman!

136
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,553
That means power makes you more masculine,
and masculine means you're ugly.

137
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,556
Well shame on you, you macho shithead!

138
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,558
All right, fuck this.
Eureka!

139
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,462
Yes, that's it! It's a simple missing persons case.

140
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,965
Gets more evolved when we find the girl.

141
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,501
- Recognize!
- It's a character piece,

142
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,103
- masked as a noir,
- wonderful.

143
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,237
Wonderful, wonderful!

144
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,939
Maybe a dubonnet with a twist.

145
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,240
It's a secret!

146
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,142
Corruption that echoes the world in which they live.

147
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,612
Yes, uh, dark shame.

148
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,819
It could be a double cross.

149
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,153
Could be, a double cross.

150
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,722
- Genius!
- Yeah!

151
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,087
<i>Maybe she joins a group, a cult, like the Source Family.</i>

152
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:01,826
A cult could be fun. It's a period
piece, but maybe we make it a mash up.

153
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,629
Set in Los Angeles over a 24 hour sequence.

154
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,798
Some dialog, dancing but heavy,

155
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,466
like <i>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.</i>

156
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,335
- I love that movie.
- Okay, so, dancing...

157
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,803
Mm hm.

158
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,472
- In a noir.
- Yep.

159
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:18,877
That's good, right, we haven't seen that! That's good.

160
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,813
Okay, so, she...

161
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,582
Who's... who's that?

162
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,456
That's what I wanna know.

163
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,809
- Hello.
- Hi.

164
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,410
How you doing?

165
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,980
- You must be Dominic.
- How do you know who I am?

166
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,216
I've seen pictures of you.

167
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,553
Er... Where?

168
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,690
In Gigi's store. I used
to work there, I'm Ava.

169
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,893
Oh, yeah. How is it
we've never met?

170
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,696
- I guess we've just never seen each other.
- You don't look like an Ava.

171
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:16,234
- What does an Ava look like.
- You change your name? Let me see your ID. Got your passport?

172
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,370
Some outfit you have on. Is your
name Lawrence by any chance?

173
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,706
Of Arabia? Close,
Raphael, of Brooklyn.

174
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,775
You wanna borrow this?
I got this one in Marrakesh,

175
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,644
Okay, Ava, Ava, here's the, um...

176
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:30,448
Raphael, Brooklyn and I, we really need to be alone.

177
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,650
So, um...

178
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,486
What you doing here?

179
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,921
Planting flowers.
I'm doing Gigi a favor.

180
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,624
My friend Carl is going to do a
shoot here in a couple of weeks.

181
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,526
Okay, Gigi, she didn't tell me anything about this.

182
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,863
- Don't worry about it. We're the king of this castle.
- Something wrong?

183
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,332
Here's the thing, Ava.
We're up here to write.

184
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,336
- We've been contracted to write a screenplay.
- We have nine days to finish.

185
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:55,206
I'll be very quiet.
Like a mouse.

186
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,575
Like a mouse.

187
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,210
I'm staying out in the trailer.

188
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,979
Well, why you doing that?

189
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:05,116
- Why not?
- Okay, see. I just wanna set the right tone.

190
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,752
The tone is set.

191
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,161
Now look.

192
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,762
That girl is very hot.

193
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,331
- I can see that.
- Just stay calm.

194
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,700
I can't control the bitches worldwide.

195
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,837
Yeah, okay, this...
This is gonna be a problem.

196
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,706
- It's probably Karl Lagerfeld.
- What?

197
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,543
Why are we whispering?

198
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,980
- What, what?
- Her friend who's gonna shoot here in a couple of weeks.

199
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:41,886
- It's probably Karl Lagerfeld, the famous designer.
- Yes, I know who he is, bitch.

200
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,425
What are you guys whispering about?

201
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,969
Ingmar Bergman.

202
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,941
I told you.

203
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,876
We don't trust something about her, correct?

204
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,312
We don't trust something about anyone. We're detectives.

205
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,680
Why hasn't she gone to the police?

206
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,181
She wants to keep it out of the paper.

207
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,784
Wants to use discretion doesn't
want anything to go on record.

208
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,119
She's got an aversion to celebrity culture.

209
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,021
Are you guys going somewhere?

210
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,089
- Yeah.
- No.

211
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,657
Why?

212
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,728
You're sitting in your car. I was hoping
you could give me a lift to the store.

213
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,631
- We can't.
- Absolutely. Why not?

214
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,701
Okay, I'm gonna walk then.
Do you guys need anything?

215
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,738
- No, no thank you. We're cool.
- Do you want some Red Bull?

216
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,274
- Are you kidding?
- For the writing.

217
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,042
No we're keeping it clean.

218
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,911
Okay.

219
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,045
Bye.

220
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:50,321
Ava, can you get me some bittersweet
chocolate, some vanilla ice cream,

221
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,690
some cookies and maybe some beef jerky.

222
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,661
- Don't go crazy. Just get one or the other.
- Worry about yourself, damn!

223
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,963
Ava!

224
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,065
Just make it vanilla swiss almond!

225
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,436
- Okay.
- And some condoms.

226
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,173
- I think you should fuck her.
- I'm absolutely not going to fuck her!

227
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,276
- It'll open you wide up.
- I'm here to write.

228
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,118
- I'm writing!
- You can do both.

229
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,016
- Are you drinking a Red Bull?
- It's Prosecco.

230
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,221
Mm, ugh. That's Red Bull. Why would you drink that?

231
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:27,592
You wanna work all night? You wanna be a big time writer?

232
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,061
Try something before you dismiss it!

233
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,798
Put down the hand sanitizer and get a little messy.

234
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,041
Gonna feel like a tarantula.

235
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,181
What the fuck was that?

236
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,498
Whoa! Gigi!

237
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,704
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
Are you okay? Are you all right?

238
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,740
Gigi, what're you...
Have you been drinking?

239
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,309
Have you...
You're wasted!

240
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,511
Gi...

241
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,147
Raphael!
Raphael.

242
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,516
- Raphael.
- Gigi!

243
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,127
What are you doing for fun these days?

244
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,897
I don't know, stranger, what have
you been doing for fun these days.

245
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,900
Think we owe each other about three happy new years.

246
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,371
- She drove here drunk.
- Oh, give it a rest!

247
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,608
I didn't drive anywhere. I stopped
for a second or something.

248
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,444
Can't you see she needs taking care of, Dominic?

249
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,880
Aw you!
You are in tune.

250
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,083
You simply tune in.
You always have.

251
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,618
Gigi!

252
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,958
My little darling!

253
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,129
Bring 'em more water please. The
last thing I want... Okay, wow.

254
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,934
Splish, splash, I feel fantastic!

255
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,971
Dom, you wanna get in there and make it a family affair?

256
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,842
I'm so happy we're all
here. It's wide open.

257
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,378
- You guys have known each other a while, right?
- Yeah.

258
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,849
- Raphael was her boyfriend, sort of.
- What do you mean, sort of?

259
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,152
Whatever they were.
That was way back.

260
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,154
Hey!

261
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:39,624
Yes, it's true. Raph was
my boyfriend, sort of.

262
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:46,597
- Speaking of, where's Wayne?
- Don't mention Wayne, no no, don't mention Wayne.

263
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,067
Why not, why?
What happened now?

264
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,872
He has some nerve.
That's all I'll say.

265
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,775
Raph and I have a lotta work
to do tonight so we might have...

266
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,278
Not a bubble bath without some bubbly.

267
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,080
Yes!

268
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:07,151
- Please man.
- Why are you people ruining my life?

269
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,088
Because I love it when a man brings me champagne!

270
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,091
The honey is flowing in all directions!

271
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,606
Yeah, get up. Let's go. We're leaving.

272
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,258
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

273
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,895
- Why?
- Why do you think?

274
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,204
Dominic. Dominic!

275
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,406
- What?
- I was losing my mind!

276
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:07,111
You can't leave, I practically crashed the car
into the house last night. I drove drunk.

277
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,780
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time.

278
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,521
Get off!

279
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,363
I don't wanna be alone right now.

280
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,331
Well I do!

281
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,070
- G, stop it.
- Why can't you stay?

282
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,775
- Because, I need to focus!
- So focus!

283
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,810
It's a really big house.

284
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:46,417
- Do you like that?
- I need you! I might be at the end of a rope.

285
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,586
Fine, all right, I'll stay!

286
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,322
Savage!

287
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,535
- Gorilla.
- Pussy!

288
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,607
What's up with my brother, what are you feeding him?

289
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,176
Roast turkey and Miles Davis of course.

290
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,870
Had a dream about you last night, G.

291
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,389
That sounds promising.

292
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,828
You were telling me you wanted to
sell your shadow for 60 dollars.

293
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,236
- I could get more than 60 bucks.
- I bet you could.

294
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,471
Hey would you mind reading this with me?

295
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,748
I'm tired of my shadow pinpointing exactly where I am.

296
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,984
I'm not sure that I follow.

297
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,518
I want to be rid of it.

298
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,622
It's not that simple, lady.

299
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,857
Neither am I.

300
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,426
There's no turning back, you understand?

301
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,868
Someone else could find a better use for it.

302
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,831
It got a little complicated...

303
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,371
Missed you.

304
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:17,541
Change of plans.
We're not leaving.

305
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:22,713
So, upstairs in five, back to work. Is this hot?

306
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:27,385
G, just so you know, you fucked up
my rib, really bad. It's killing me.

307
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:31,422
- Let's go. Back to work.
- So...

308
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,762
...you write and then you dream,
or you dream and then you write?

309
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,465
- Which comes first?
- I dunno, that's a good question.

310
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,402
Sometimes I think the dream is writing me.

311
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,649
- So if we find her, why don't we bring her back?
- I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

312
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,518
Because if we bring her back, the movie ends.

313
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,254
I'm not so sure about that, I'm not sure at all.

314
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,122
What's so special about this cult?

315
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:11,195
Primary colors, Stanley the dog, abandoned peers.
Keep that close, abandoned peers.

316
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:15,666
Trans-cranial
magnetic stimulation.

317
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,435
Grapefruit the size of cannonballs.

318
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:22,907
The realism of nature combined with the
serial-ism of nature, aka, whimsy. Aha!

319
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,375
What?

320
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:30,047
Carlos Puyol beats Real Madrid with his head.
With his head!

321
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,418
Raph, Raph, Raph. What? Okay, what is all that?
Where you going with all this?

322
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,555
You see how quickly young Ava dropped her robe?

323
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,024
You gotta love a girl who can think on her feet, huh?

324
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,394
If you're a man with sight, you'll
notice she had a little fur down there.

325
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,997
I've been wondering for some time now if
the kids have been bringing bush back.

326
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,000
<i>Kojak</i> has been ruling the area for a long time now.

327
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:53,037
Back in the day, your sister had a full on Joan Baez.

328
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,574
- Okay, stop, stop. Please, stop!
- What? What?

329
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,910
These are my notes.

330
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,079
These are things that can spark my vision.

331
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,782
We have to stick with it to get somewhere.

332
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:09,854
I need to circle the muse. I need to let
the character emerge. I'm not a machine!

333
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:14,258
You need to circle. You seem to circle a lotta things.

334
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,594
Oh, I see what's happening here.

335
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,630
I'm just saying man, sometimes, you gotta push.

336
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:24,301
Man, you gotta jump!

337
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,637
All right!
Okay! All right!

338
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:30,908
Just forget it, forget it! Back to
the story, okay? Back to the story.

339
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,678
Just give me something real man,
something deep, something truthful!

340
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,951
Oh, it rubs me the wrong way when you say deep, and truth.
It just rubs me the wrong way!

341
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:44,655
The guy who wants success in ten days.
The guy who wants everything now.

342
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,224
That guy's gonna talk to me about truth, about death?

343
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,693
- You don't wanna get in there.
- Get in where, get in where?

344
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,263
You're just saying words, I dunno
what you're talking about!

345
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,698
This is the omphalos of the entire story.

346
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,135
- The omphalos?
- The navel, the central point?

347
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,837
Fuck you, word of the day.

348
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,756
You gotta be kidding.

349
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,301
Dark, Mediterranean man sits at his computer,

350
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,436
a pensive look on his face.

351
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:36,173
- Hi, Ava.
- The curious girl enters the room.

352
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:44,882
Hey, look, Ava, you're a really nice girl, but
I thought you were gonna be quiet as a mouse.

353
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,653
His brow tightens, she offers him a drink.
This is for you.

354
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,964
No, I wasn't. I was
just waving to you and I was...

355
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,733
Look at those two.
They can't resist.

356
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,338
- How's the writing?
- I'm stuck.

357
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,240
On what?

358
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,279
Um, in...

359
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,748
In the story, my character's hired to

360
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,984
find this girl who's wrapped up in a cult.

361
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:23,654
I find her, I don't know what happens next.
She's in some kind of trouble.

362
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,957
Well, I know all about trouble.

363
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,194
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

364
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,364
Well, what kind of trouble have you been wrapped up in?

365
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,799
It depends how you define trouble.

366
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,670
Sometimes trouble give you the answers.

367
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,875
Maybe your character is conflicted.

368
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:51,515
This girl is drawn to you. She's involved
in something that intrigues you.

369
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,652
Question is, do you explore it?

370
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,529
Or maybe he's falling for her.

371
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,965
Anyway, if you get stuck again, give me a holler.

372
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:54,244
So he buys me this '66 Barracuda Fastback.

373
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,481
Pearl white, burgundy bucket seats, I love it.

374
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,049
- And Wayne loves it.
- I love it.

375
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:02,486
For about a week. And then the
next week he's just in his shell.

376
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:08,592
He's curled up, he won't get out of bed, and he's angry.
So angry about everything!

377
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,061
Then suddenly decides he wants to get rid of it.

378
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,663
- What!
- Not just the car.

379
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,265
He's suddenly obsessed with the Ramapough Indians.

380
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:19,570
- To what end, I have no idea!
- Is that a new thing?

381
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:25,943
He's riding the Staten Island ferry back and forth. He's
not going to Staten Island, he's just riding the ferry.

382
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,545
Says he needs to stay on the water.

383
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,681
I don't know what's going on with him.

384
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:35,085
Maybe it's everything going on in the world right now.
Maybe that's what's setting him off.

385
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,521
- Yeah.
- I dunno.

386
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,957
We were so good for so long.

387
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:46,630
- And now, we're not connected.
- Not working.

388
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:49,166
I feel like he's bamboozling me, unless maybe it's me.

389
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,368
- No it's not.
- No, my man is fucked up.

390
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,274
I'm sorry, G. I love you, but he's got
some serious issues. He was in a war.

391
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:00,077
Then he was fucking Team Six.

392
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,646
- What's Team Six?
- It means he was elite.

393
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,281
Okay, the best at what he did.

394
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:09,520
Anything after that, it has to feel
like a let down to some degree.

395
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,689
- She's no let down!
- Yeah man.

396
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:17,594
No, you know what I mean. I don't mean that. It's
just that now he's a... he's a glorified handyman.

397
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:22,633
Let's not glorify the fact that Wayne is a
product of the military industrial complex.

398
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:26,837
It's sad, but he made choices. What I know,

399
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,975
is Gigi here is a radiant sunflower.
And one who appreciates the sun,

400
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,377
certainly loves sunflowers.

401
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,850
You're in love with him.
It's really simple.

402
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,823
Battle of the sexes,
people. Men in the lead.

403
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,891
All right, let's do it.
Let's go. I'll play around.

404
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,227
- On the case.
- I'll play around, here.

405
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,662
Get this going.

406
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,697
- Billie Jean gonna go down.
- I remember how to do this.

407
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,899
Oh, yeah.
Dominic is on fire.

408
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,203
Winning does make you feel good.
I haven't won in a while.

409
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:00,437
Wait a second.

410
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,840
Winning is all. Chiang Kai-shek, remember that.

411
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,209
This is it. This is how it should be.

412
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,445
Friendship is as important as
romantic love, remember that.

413
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,116
The cards are life. Minnesota Fats, remember that.

414
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,986
It's all in the sauce.

415
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:19,990
Listen, Raph, here it is. I've got pages man,
exciting stuff. This is what happens, okay?

416
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,793
Our girl, she's running from everything, you know?

417
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:26,797
Her family, society, the status
quo's, all getting ripped out.

418
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,502
She's found a new life with this cult, and I'll tell you
this much. It is beautiful and I am wide open to it.

419
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:34,505
- Now what do you think?
- I think you're out.

420
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:37,508
I'm out.

421
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,977
I won.

422
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:45,516
You're mine.
You're mine.

423
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:52,523
Hey, hey, watch out. Okay, come on you two, let's do it.

424
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,185
<i>Don't be a sap, Renee.</i>

425
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:25,547
You dummy up on me now, you're
looking at 99 years in Cincy.

426
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,192
Where'd you stash the dame?

427
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,560
I'm not telling you where she is.

428
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,164
I don't see that you have much of a choice, bucko.

429
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,166
You wouldn't understand.

430
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,014
Try me.

431
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,941
She told me about the light.

432
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:48,145
- I'm not talking about a street lamp.
- Yeah.

433
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:54,651
A light? You getting
sucked into her cult.

434
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,621
I'll be lookin' for you next.

435
00:30:57,623 --> 00:31:01,291
- You may not find me.
- Wonderful, wonderful!

436
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:04,228
- Wonderful scenes you've written. I love it
- It's good right?

437
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,966
I can't see him right now. You gotta...
You gotta stall him. Make him go away.

438
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,667
Something! Okay?

439
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,376
Yo, dude! What's up, man?
Come down!

440
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,111
Yeah, I'll be right down.

441
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,814
How you gonna act, man?

442
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,650
- I dunno.
- Oh, cool.

443
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,086
- What does Gigi want?
- She wants me to be cool.

444
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,255
Cool, man, so just stay here, cool spirit.

445
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:36,593
Smoke this, dude. Chill out, when
you're done you go inside. Cool?

446
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,629
Yeah, okay, you want me to stay here?

447
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,964
Yeah, stay here, I gotta piss.

448
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,570
- Wait...
- Dude I gotta piss!

449
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,033
Gigi!

450
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,938
Gigi!

451
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,845
Hey, killer.

452
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,348
Look who it is. Holy shit.

453
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,184
I didn't know you were going to fucking be here.
What're you doing?

454
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,553
I'm up here with Dominic, yeah, I'm writing with Dom.

455
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,055
- Work.
- Yeah, work.

456
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:42,025
- You still acting?
- Yeah, I still got the curse.

457
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:46,296
Well, you still look like a movie star. You get botox yet?

458
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,368
These are new. Saw Dom on <i>Law and Order.</i>

459
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,305
Got his ear cut off. He was being such a pussy about it.

460
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,940
You still working at the bar?

461
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,776
Yeah, I'm still working at the bar.

462
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:05,782
I gotta take care of some stuff with G, so, um...
maybe we have a barbecue later.

463
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,984
Yeah?

464
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,719
She mentioned you guys had a little blow off.

465
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,698
She did?

466
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,681
You know, just in passing.

467
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,038
Thought maybe you'd wanna go get some flowers,

468
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,540
bring them up there, Clark Gable style.

469
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,010
Oh, is that what you think?

470
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,880
Well, all we have up here is flowers.

471
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,235
I guess I'm the flowers.

472
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,185
Yeah, I'm just saying.

473
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,154
- She's still in bed.
- She's in bed?

474
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:48,392
You know that? You know that she's in bed?
How do you know that she's in bed?

475
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,935
How do you know she's still in bed?

476
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,713
You got a lotta information.

477
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:08,045
Just up here riding with Dom, you know?

478
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,346
You said that.

479
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:22,559
- Runs good, don't it.
- Yeah.

480
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,029
Hey, man, you haven't
changed a bit. Look out!

481
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,106
G. Hey, G.

482
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,341
G?

483
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:01,298
- Hey, man, nice haircut, dude. Like the way you're wearing it.
- Thanks, man, thanks.

484
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,867
You know, what's going on? I
thought you were driving to L.A?

485
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,670
Dude, so did I. We got to Ohio and Wayne pulled a 180.

486
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:10,407
- Wants to work it out with Gigi
- How long you gonna stay, you think?

487
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,409
Dude, I dunno. Could be a while.

488
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:16,146
Hey can you do me a favor? There's a black
bag in there, it's Wayne's. Can you grab it?

489
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:19,549
- Just in the back, dude.
- Yeah, no I got it.

490
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,619
- What is this?
- Oh, bro, that's my head shot man.

491
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,556
- What do you need a head shot for?
- Oh, it's for my show.

492
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,158
What show?

493
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,428
You didn't hear it, dude? I got my own show.
Wayne's such a dick!

494
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,965
- I don't get it.
- Dude, I don't get it either, bro.

495
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,735
I'm just teaching my class at
Point Pleasant one day, surfing

496
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,071
It's like the best day of my life everyday.

497
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:43,206
Then getting changed on the beach, right?

498
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:47,344
This guy comes up to me. He's like
"Hey, bro, I've been watching you."

499
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:51,648
And I'm like "Hey, bro, what the fuck, man?" Because
I thought he was trying to pick me up, dude.

500
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,116
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

501
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,186
Happens that this guy works for Jerry Bruckenheimer dude.

502
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,122
- Jerry Bruckheimer?
- Jerry Bruck-heemer.

503
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,424
- Bruckheimer.
- Yeah, dude, he did <i>Armageddon.</i>

504
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,894
He does <i>The Amazing Race,</i> all these huge things!

505
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,263
- Jerr... Jerry Bruckheimer.
- Jerry Bruckheimer, yeah, dude!

506
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,665
He called me on my cellphone,
I pick up. I'm like "Hello"...

507
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,702
I'm like "Okay, dude, yeah, go fuck yourself'",
because I thought it was Vasper calling.

508
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,505
Dude, it was really Jerry Bruckheimer,
he called me up, he was like

509
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,408
"Hey, man, I want you to come in,
I want to talk about your show."

510
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,678
So I go in and sit down with him, dude. You know what?

511
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,714
Great guy, man, he's wearing these
tight jeans, he's kinda staring.

512
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:28,218
He's got these beady eyes, so
I'm like "Hey man", you know?

513
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,321
"Is everything cool here?" and he's
like "Yeah, everything is cool here."

514
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:37,227
- So then, we start talking and we just get each other dude.
- Yeah.

515
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:40,163
He's like my other brother from another mother, dude.

516
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,866
We're just mano e mano, really vibing out,

517
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,636
and then he turns to me
he's like "You're my guy."

518
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,340
- Guy for what?
- Dude, for my show I just told you about!

519
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:53,176
It's a reality show about my life, bro, I'm gonna teach

520
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:55,745
guest celebrities how to surf and they're gonna compete.

521
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,115
Dude, it's like <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>.
I mean meets <i>The It Factor,</i>

522
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,951
meets, like, <i>American Idol,</i>

523
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:02,953
meets, like, we're gonna party.

524
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:06,590
- Sick!
- How much is he paying you for this?

525
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:10,227
Dude, can't tell ya. Signed a confidentiality agreement.

526
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:13,997
It's a lot of money, dude.

527
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,335
Hey, man, dude hang on a sec, man.

528
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:21,438
My new agents are working out the contract, fucking UTA.

529
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,575
- Ooda?
- Yeah, dude, United Talent Agency.

530
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,878
- U-T-A?
- Yeah I call 'em "UTA" to fuck with them.

531
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,649
UTA, man, that's top ten.

532
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:39,522
- Hey man, what are you up to, dude? What're you doing here?
- I'm just, you know man...

533
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:42,993
- I was, uh...
- Wayne said you were on <i>L.A Law.</i>

534
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,762
You got your ear cut off or something?

535
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,664
That was a while ago, but, yeah.

536
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,100
That's great news, that's awesome news.

537
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:53,103
Awesome. The door's that way.

538
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,973
Look at all the chimes, man!
Everywhere, just chimes.

539
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,582
Okay, man, I'll see you inside.

540
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,186
G. G, wait, G!
God dammit!

541
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:12,455
- Gigi just pull out?
- She did.

542
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,158
- What she do that for? Did she know I was here?
- I don't know.

543
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,363
- Come inside. Ah. Ow, Wayne!
- I'm here.

544
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,166
Aah, fuck.

545
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,139
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right. Um...

546
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:33,176
I really don't know if she knew you were here.

547
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,046
I'm sorry, man, I didn't mean
to do that. I was just...

548
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,849
- It's good, see, I'm cool.
- You okay?

549
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,352
I'm okay, yeah. What about you? You okay?

550
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,222
Yeah, man, I'm good, man, I'm good.

551
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,626
- That's good.
- You know...

552
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:52,529
Gigi hasn't been picking up my calls for a few days, so...

553
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,767
- But I'm good, you know.
- You guys gonna...

554
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:01,371
- have it out or something? I mean...
- Absolutely not.

555
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,841
Negative.

556
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,078
- Because I'm up here...
- Is she gonna break up with me?

557
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,452
Wayne, I dunno what she's gonna do. I really don't know.

558
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,887
It's just, I'm up here, I'm trying to work

559
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,170
Yeah, that's what Raph said.

560
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,792
You guys are working up here.

561
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,062
I didn't know you were gonna be up here you
know, so it was a little bit of a surprise.

562
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:30,400
- Well, I told G, you know.
- What are you guys doing here, what's Raph doing here?

563
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:34,070
He's writing a script with me. We're
trying to write a screenplay.

564
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,507
About what?

565
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,145
It's about some fucked up, you know,
like some noir stuff. Some...

566
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:45,648
- missing people, and things...
- That's cool, man, I'm not gonna get in the way.

567
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,419
I just wanted to see G man. I don't know
if she's been picking up my calls...

568
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,390
But I'm here to make it cool, you know. It's
cool, I mean is she cool? You think she's cool?

569
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:56,226
- What do you think?
- You think she's being uncool?

570
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,331
- I'm asking you a question. Can you focus?
- Okay.

571
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:05,502
I'm saying that I'm cool, and I'm wondering if she's cool.

572
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,139
- Is she cool?
- She's gonna come back.

573
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,441
I'm just asking if she's cool.

574
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,710
She's been normal.

575
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:17,480
Are you not hearing what I'm saying?
I'm just asking is she cool.

576
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:20,150
I dunno, I mean, I'm not sure what we're talking about.

577
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,732
Don't worry about it.

578
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,259
Where's my bag?

579
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,061
- Huh?
- Where's my bag?

580
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,399
I dunno... Maybe...

581
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,171
- Maybe that's it there.
- What's it doing over there?

582
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:47,010
- What's it doing over here?
- I have no idea.

583
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,480
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about that.
I didn't mean to... You okay?

584
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,148
Yeah, I'm good.

585
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,492
All right, see you later, Wayne.

586
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,736
It's just we're being pushed out!

587
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:17,407
- It's a reality surfer show, so what?
- So what?

588
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:19,242
It starts with a stupid surfer show,

589
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:23,646
or Idol, <i>Top Model,</i> then your Jennifer
Hudson winning a fucking oscar!

590
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,848
Do you wanna work?

591
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,785
- But you act like you don't care!
- I don't care?

592
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:33,756
I don't know, just... What are we missing? What?

593
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,861
- Maybe, Devon... maybe he just has 'it'.
- Definitely has 'Id'.

594
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:41,464
- So you agree, he has 'it'?
- He's a beach bum, he's a pleasure seeker.

595
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,533
What does that have to do with having 'it'?

596
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,001
Having 'it'?

597
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,136
- That's what the fuck I'm talking about!
- Thought you meant 'Id'.

598
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:51,207
Do you think he has that something special?
Jesus Christ, Raph.

599
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,043
I wouldn't go so far as to say <i>Endless Summer,</i>

600
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,346
has 'it', whatever that is exactly.

601
00:41:56,348 --> 00:42:01,084
Maybe people are seeing something in him, that they
just don't see in us, and that something is 'it'.

602
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:04,454
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- He's on TV, we're not!

603
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:06,656
He's got a big agent, we don't.

604
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,726
I bet you, in a year, he's doing
a war film with Ed Harris,

605
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:14,364
and you and I are still shaking Cosmos in
Brooklyn, talking about Bertolt Brecht.

606
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:22,038
I'm not gonna change my philosophy for
living because Devon got a reality TV show.

607
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:29,846
Come on! Okay, so what is this so
called philosophy for living, Raph?

608
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,448
Because the last I looked, you
were a 40 year old bartender.

609
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,551
I don't give a motherfuck about <i>Idol!</i>

610
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:37,086
I don't give a motherfuck about Jennifer Hudson,

611
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,622
surfing, 'it', or whatever you're talking about!

612
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,457
Now I wanna end this conversation.

613
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,493
Either you're doing something wrong,

614
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:49,499
or you're doing everything right. That
could mean that you just don't have 'it'.

615
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:54,504
If you have talent, if you have
real talent, you don't question it,

616
00:42:54,506 --> 00:43:00,944
and people that constantly question it, are the
mediocre ones, and that's what you are. Mediocre.

617
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,868
Is that how you really feel about me?

618
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,223
I mean, is that how you really feel?

619
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,759
- You're doing it right now!
- What? I'm doing what?

620
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,194
You're begging approval.

621
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:22,332
You have this pathetic need for
validation, look at you. Even from me.

622
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,668
Even from me, the 40 year old bartender.

623
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,004
Well, at least I'm putting myself out there.

624
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:33,910
At least I'm going for something. You know what,
that takes courage. You're doing nothing!

625
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:38,548
You've become a novelty act, and I'll tell you something,

626
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,519
you're kidding yourself if you think my sister
would ever have a serious relationship with you.

627
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,789
You're an entertainment.

628
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,828
No one we know takes
you seriously. No one.

629
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,399
You're a fucking joke.

630
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:43,146
Should take a blowtorch to this fucking place.

631
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:50,019
Dude, there's some chick out here, bro, it's
like a mirage. She's so fucking hot, dude.

632
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:55,725
- You know her?
- That's Ava. She used to work for Gigi.

633
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,394
You're not gonna land her the way you do those L.A skanks.

634
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,697
Couple of tiki drinks with some coke.

635
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,799
Dude, nobody drinks tiki drinks.

636
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,408
Do you think I can fuck her, bro?

637
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:16,713
- See all this stuff out here? See all this?
- Yeah.

638
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:22,919
- It's my stuff. Gigi put all my stuff out here.
- Wanna bring it back in?

639
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,723
She thinks it's over, she's wrong.

640
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:31,394
Well, do you think, there's a chance it might be?

641
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,696
Might be what?

642
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,202
- Over, dude.
- Come here.

643
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:42,405
- What?
- Come here.

644
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,675
- Come on, man. What did I do, dude?
- Come here.

645
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,881
- Come here.
- What? What are you doing?

646
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:55,318
- Nothing man.
- Nothing? What are you doing? Hey.

647
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,753
- Hey.
- Hey.

648
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:57,820
- Hey.
- Hey.

649
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,323
- Hey.
- Why?

650
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:04,060
- Why?
- What are you doing, man? What are you doing, stop.

651
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:07,563
- What are you prepared to do?
- No, Wayne, don't get yourself worked up.

652
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,266
- Is God big and white?
- Don't get yourself worked up.

653
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,136
- Do you believe in the Pope?
- Chill out, stay in the pocket.

654
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:16,339
I'm in the pocket.
You in the pocket?

655
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:20,710
You want the same shit to happen that happened in the city?
You want that to happen here?

656
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,513
Do you?

657
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,582
Do you, man?

658
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:29,719
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

659
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,121
- I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah, me too, man.

660
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,593
Hey, tell me
this. She 18?

661
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,360
- Hey.
- Hi.

662
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,462
What's happening?

663
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:16,866
- You look nice and comfy.
- I feel comfy.

664
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,770
- You know Wayne?
- I do.

665
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,139
I'm his brother, Devon.

666
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,976
- You're Ava.
- I am.

667
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,079
Hey.

668
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:35,251
Welcome to our illustrious country
home, Wayne's brother, Devon.

669
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,258
I surf.

670
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,962
Cool. Professionally?

671
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:51,601
Yeah, but that's not all I do. I'm a philanthropist.
Got my own clothing line.

672
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,470
Devon, Devon!

673
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,773
I gotta get in the pocket man.
Gimme your car keys.

674
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:59,842
Oh, they're in the visor.

675
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:10,720
He's fine. So, like,
what do you do?

676
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,890
What are you a professional at?

677
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,626
Wayne said you're en entrepreneur?

678
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,062
Did I just see Wayne drive down the road?

679
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,865
Yeah, he just took a drive to get his head straight.

680
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,805
- Hi, Dev.
- Hey, G.

681
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:32,742
Just met Ava.
She's very pretty.

682
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,579
You know...

683
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,548
Wayne really wants to work it out with you.

684
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:49,625
- He's trying, you know, he's really trying.
- He's crazy.

685
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,469
Izzy, I didn't get your messages.
The service is in and out up here.

686
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,906
<i>I had to go to the emergency animal
hospital, all night with him.</i>

687
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:06,542
- <i>All night and...</i>
- The service is bad. If I knew...

688
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,346
Of course I would have called you if I
knew Benny hurt his eye, I mean, what...

689
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:15,184
Just tell me what's... What happened?
Tell me what happened? Is he okay?

690
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:19,789
<i>I don't wanna talk to you until you're done
writing this screenplay, or whatever it is.</i>

691
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,259
Are you serious? Are you seriously
doing this to me right now?

692
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:26,228
- Can you put Benny on speaker phone? I wanna talk to him.
- No, no, no.

693
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,166
<i>That's ridiculous. I'm not putting
your dog on speaker phone.</i>

694
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:33,035
Izz? Izzy,
are you there?

695
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,505
- You okay?
- Jesus!

696
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:41,644
- Devon, you just scared the shit out of me.
- All right, dude, chill out.

697
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,113
We're in a country.
It's illustrious here.

698
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:59,729
- How you doing, babe?
- What the hell?

699
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:04,433
- What happened to you?
- Me and your brother getting down at the deeper truths.

700
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,795
How's it going with you and Wayne?

701
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,638
- I haven't seen him yet.
- Yeah?

702
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,675
Well, if you need me, you shoot up a flare, okay?

703
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,977
You still got it!

704
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:18,547
Look, I'm throwing a goddamn party
here tonight, lighting this place up.

705
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:23,953
- You got an old suit in that collection for me?
- A party? Yeah, sure.

706
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,222
- I have a suit, of course.
- Okay, good.

707
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:35,197
- You smell that night jasmine, do you?
- Yeah, I smell it.

708
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:43,172
Be cool, Raph. Okay?
Just be cool.

709
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,155
Hold up, broheim.

710
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:02,291
What's up superstar, I heard
about your show. Congrats.

711
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,161
Thanks, friend.
Nice ride.

712
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,830
What do you want, Dev?

713
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,800
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the store.

714
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,602
Are you gonna get something for Gigi?

715
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:18,207
I'm gonna get something for everybody you want
me to pick you up a nice Rose there, Venice?

716
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,378
Your eyes, my eyes.

717
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:28,317
Your eyes, my eyes, bro.
I'm watching you. All day.

718
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,328
Hi.

719
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,897
Hi, Devon.

720
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,420
- Hello?
<i>- What're you doing?</i>

721
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:09,191
I'm thinking.

722
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,398
<i>What's all that noise?</i>

723
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,871
- Cooking.
- <i>Mm, what're you cooking?</i>

724
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,376
Everything.

725
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:28,944
<i>- Sauce?</i>
<i>- </i> Yeah.

726
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,113
<i>Polenta?</i>

727
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,315
- Mm hm.
- <i>Nice.</i>

728
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,052
<i>Lamb?</i>

729
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,925
- What do you want?
- <i>Come around the corner, by the pond.</i>

730
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,801
Hey, how's the sauce?

731
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:58,607
- Good. What're those?
- Would you like to have a seat?

732
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,242
Where'd you get 'em?
Did you take them?

733
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:03,279
Don't worry about where I got 'em. Just sit down, please?

734
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:04,780
I wanna talk.

735
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:07,917
- Did you take those chairs from somebody's porch?
- I borrowed them.

736
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:09,852
Just bring 'em back, Jesus.

737
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:12,454
I thought we could sit down and talk and be nice.
What you being so uptight about?

738
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:15,391
- You asked me to marry you!
- How is that a bad thing?

739
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,692
I don't see how this is a bad...

740
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,260
How and when you did it is the bad thing.

741
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:21,263
And then you just took off?
That's a bad thing!

742
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,203
- I mean what were you thinking?
- I don't know.

743
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:35,311
My head was fucked up, okay, but I've
been thinking about this for a long time.

744
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:41,350
- Jesus Christ, Wayne.
- Jesus Christ what? What do you want from me? I love you.

745
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,018
I wanna marry you.

746
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:47,790
Where are you going? Don't you
think I know what's wrong with me?

747
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:51,360
Please, come back.
Please, come back here.

748
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:56,332
I got something for you. It's an anger
card, just for you to... Sit down.

749
00:53:56,334 --> 00:54:01,070
- Babe, sit down.
- Hey, I don't wanna sit.

750
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:06,208
"There's nothing really worth getting angry about.
What're you angry about this time?"

751
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,780
- Are you asking me this? I don't get it.
- No that's to myself.

752
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:16,819
I've been carrying that around for a few weeks now.
I write stuff down that...

753
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:21,557
- Triggers?
- Yeah! More I write it out, more I can start to see the...

754
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,496
- Patterns?
- Patterns.

755
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,266
And then I can start to figure some of that shit out.

756
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,503
Okay. This is very
evolved for you.

757
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,486
Is this some kind of trick?

758
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,377
What do you think?
No, it's not a trick.

759
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,180
Okay, it's a trick.
You're being tricked.

760
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,850
"Lights."

761
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:50,185
Yeah? Okay, I know that one.

762
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,756
"Bruni the super?"

763
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:58,093
- Yeah, that fucking guy.
- Well, I know. Me too, for that matter.

764
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,597
Rain...

765
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,932
Rain gets you mad?

766
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:09,171
No, not the rain. Umbrellas. People aren't
careful you could get your eye poked out.

767
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:13,742
They could easily lift it up, or tilt it.
They don't fucking do that.

768
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,178
Get poked with a fucking umbrella.

769
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,983
I don't see anything on here about the Barracuda.

770
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:25,954
Are you listening, are you really reading this?
I'm working my way up to the big one.

771
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:33,362
Why would you wait till now to give me this?
After you've caused all these problems...

772
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,468
You do something like this, and then
you propose, that's reasonable.

773
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,404
But, not on the heels of a huge argument.

774
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,907
And then you...

775
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:48,010
<i>♪ Did you ever see a dream
walking? ♪</i>

776
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,079
<i>♪ Well, I did ♪</i>

777
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:54,917
<i>♪ Did you ever see a dream
talking? ♪</i>

778
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:56,585
<i>♪ Well, I did ♪</i>

779
00:55:56,587 --> 00:56:00,022
<i>♪ Did you ever see heaven
right in your arms? ♪</i>

780
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,424
<i>♪ Saying I love you, I do ♪</i>

781
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:03,726
Stop it!

782
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:05,961
Well the dream that was walking, I...

783
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,529
That was a little high.

784
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,701
- Stop. Stop!

785
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,871
I love you...

786
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,775
I didn't want you to leave. I never want you to leave.

787
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,831
But you're always fucking leaving.

788
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:29,418
I'm working on it, baby. What do
you think the card's all about?

789
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,222
I don't wanna leave. I don't
want you to leave either.

790
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,694
Let's get married.

791
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:43,732
- Oh, my God!
- What, oh, my God?

792
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,436
I can't believe you did it again!

793
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,572
- What am I doing?
- You're not getting it.

794
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:28,577
<i>Dominic! Hey, it's me, Kaplan. Listen, bad news,
the money went away for a little project.</i>

795
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:31,146
<i>So, I won't be needing your script.</i>

796
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:35,517
<i>But hey, these things happen, you know, so,
you gotta stick it out. The money was there,</i>

797
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,520
<i>now it's not. It's very frustrating, but what can you do?</i>

798
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:41,657
<i>Okay, take care, babe.
I gotta go. Bye.</i>

799
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:47,996
Fuck.

800
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:08,083
You were crying.
Why were you crying?

801
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,118
Because they sliced my ear off, dude.

802
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,423
But that's not what would happen. That's blunt trauma.
You would go into shock or something.

803
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:16,758
You've never had your ear cut off.
How the fuck do you know?

804
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,094
No, but I've been shot. Got a
piece of shrapnel on my thigh,

805
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:23,065
seen my buddies get their fingers blown off.
That's not what happens. You go into shock.

806
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:26,201
This guy, it was very close to my head, man.

807
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:31,273
- It hit nerves and shit.
- What about playing like an interior decorator?

808
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:35,077
Or maybe like a hairdresser?

809
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,813
Stop it.
Come on, Wayne.

810
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,582
- Wanna do a shot?
- Yes.

811
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,326
Let's go out.

812
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,090
Cheers, bro!

813
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,258
Cheers!

814
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,093
I want you, right there.
You, give me...

815
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:33,735
<i>Check, check, check!</i>

816
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:37,573
<i>DJ Fluxus is gonna juxt your whole position, people.</i>

817
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,975
<i>Everyone back down on the dance floor.</i>

818
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,677
Let's do it.

819
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:08,397
Listen to me, you're my everything.
You're all that means anything to me.

820
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:13,502
You're my ice cream sundae,
you understand. You get me?

821
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,774
Why don't we go to Niagara Falls and have a honeymoon?

822
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,210
- Hey.
- Hey.

823
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:27,282
Hi! Those were seriously
some good dance moves.

824
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:30,285
- You too!
- Thanks.

825
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:34,790
Cold water doesn't bother me. I can
keep my hand in there all night.

826
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,625
Maybe you should do that.

827
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,765
Ah. No.

828
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,635
Sorry.

829
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:49,471
Whoa, what the fuck?
You're not into this?

830
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,485
- Come here.
- What? Oh.

831
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:20,435
<i>Everybody on the dance
floor. Everybody, come down.</i>

832
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:24,473
We do the honeymoon now, and if that
goes well, we can get married later.

833
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,541
- Know what I mean?
- I like that.

834
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:30,045
And if we get really crazy, we could drive to Canada.

835
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:32,647
Keep on driving to Montreal.

836
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:35,717
Is that something you wanna do?
Don't you wanna do that?

837
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,520
Do you wanna do that?

838
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,192
What?

839
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:46,895
Look I'm sorry, it's just, you know, I...

840
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,663
Have a girlfriend.

841
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,835
That's not what I'm talking about.

842
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,444
All right, okay, okay, next.

843
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,380
You know what the main ingredient of the marshmallow is?

844
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,249
- Sugar!
- No.

845
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,718
- Horse?
- Cocaine?

846
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,154
- No. What?
- Horse... horse hoof.

847
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:14,022
- Hooves, hooves!
- Oh, my God.

848
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,697
Politics. Politics
people, politics.

849
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:25,600
All right, last one. Who's on the 500 dollar bill?

850
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:29,271
William McKinley. William McKinley. William McKinley.

851
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:31,807
- Bitches.
- Who the fuck knows that?

852
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:36,745
No one. That's the point. William McKinley was a fucking
president of the United States and no one knows who he is.

853
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:42,684
Everybody knows who Washington is. Lincoln, fucking Ben
Franklin wasn't even president and he's on some money.

854
01:03:42,686 --> 01:03:45,554
But what the fuck did William McKinley do?

855
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:49,024
- He got assassinated.
- He did get assassinated.

856
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:51,193
- Does anybody know?
- He was President?

857
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:55,197
- I've never even heard of him.
- They don't even make 500 dollar bills any more.

858
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,998
What's your point?

859
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,069
My point is, McKinley never made his mark.

860
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,804
Oh.

861
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:06,308
- So you're a man on a mission.
- Yeah, I'm a man on a mission.

862
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,610
You know, I wanna make a mark.

863
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,079
What then?

864
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:18,286
I don't know. That's it. I get to
live my life doing what I love.

865
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,957
Again, and again and again, and again.

866
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:25,427
And then we die, and then it's over and who cares?

867
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,529
We're all fucking just bacteria, dude.

868
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:34,870
Why are you so caught up in making a mark for?

869
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:38,540
I wake up every morning with this...

870
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:44,546
pain in my stomach like I did something wrong.
I don't wanna feel that shit any more.

871
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,782
Shame.

872
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:49,985
I don't know what it is but I don't wanna feel it.

873
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:52,220
Was talking about
self-loathing. Shame.

874
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,594
You gotta look to it man.

875
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,698
Everything else will come.

876
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,203
I don't know...

877
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,539
But you do know.

878
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:17,812
It's exactly that. The weight of all this
stuff gets lifted when you embrace love.

879
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:21,383
All of this other stuff is real.

880
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:24,953
But it's good to align yourself with love. It helps.

881
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,157
What's the point, if we don't have love?

882
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,326
Yeah.

883
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:33,094
Why are we here?

884
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:40,902
Yeah, dude, love. Riding high energy.
When I surf, I feel love.

885
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:45,140
A wave is like a wavelength
of energy. It's moving water

886
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:48,777
and I'm riding the surface.
Dude, think about that!

887
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:53,682
I'm in perfect harmony with
mother nature when I'm surfing.

888
01:05:53,684 --> 01:05:56,551
- That's amazing!
- That is amazing.

889
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,023
I love Gigi.

890
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,860
I love Gigi too.

891
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,230
I love you.

892
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,399
Take it easy, tiger.
She loves you too.

893
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:14,002
I'm serious.

894
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:19,107
- I love you too.
- Here have a marshmallow.

895
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:23,745
Love is a giant pickle.

896
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,949
I'm in love with you.

897
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:34,589
These people, they don't know what we're
talking about. I'm in love with you.

898
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:38,259
Wayne, I'm sorry you have to hear this.
I got nothing against you.

899
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,835
There's something alive here between Gigi and me.

900
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,571
Right.

901
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:54,809
Remember back in the day, you wanted to drive
down the Pan-American highway with me?

902
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,812
Remember that?

903
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:01,334
You wanted to drive all the way down there with me?

904
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,285
But I wasn't ready.

905
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,658
- These last few days have been so...
- Let's hear him out.

906
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:18,533
Gigi, I can love you like you never, ever, ever...

907
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:24,672
Like earth, like magic. Just
meet me in my car at 4:00 a.m..

908
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:28,943
You don't bring anything.
We gonna make that drive.

909
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,638
Hey, Dev, you're in the wrong car.

910
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,794
Sorry.

911
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,747
Good night.

912
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,544
What's up big boy?

913
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,376
You know, I like what you guys have written so far.

914
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,079
Yeah, what do you like about it?

915
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,322
I like that they fall in love.

916
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,822
Does she fall through with the double cross?

917
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:30,144
Because that would be heart breaking.

918
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,461
Would.

919
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,620
Think she goes through with the double cross?

920
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,689
I absolutely do.
