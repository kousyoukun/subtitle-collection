1
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,900
"France 1916"

2
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,880
War began between Germany and France...

3
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,070
on August 3, 1914.

4
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,980
Five weeks later, the German army
had smashed its way...

5
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,520
to within 18 miles of Paris.

6
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,790
There the battered French miraculously
rallied at the Marne River...

7
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,230
and in a series of unexpected
counterattacks, drove the Germans back.

8
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,730
The front was stabilized
and shortly afterwards...

9
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,530
developed into a continuous line
of heavily fortified trenches...

10
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,970
zigzagging their way 500 miles...

11
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,530
from the English Channel
to the Swiss frontier.

12
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,510
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare...

13
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,780
the battle lines had changed
very little.

14
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,410
Successful attacks were measured
in hundreds of yards...

15
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,550
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,360
General Broulard, sir.

17
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,830
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Paul.

18
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,730
Wonderful seeing you again.
Really wonderful.

19
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,700
Well, this is splendid.

20
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,500
Superb! Grand, very grand.

21
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,230
Well, I've tried to create a pleasant
atmosphere in which to work.

22
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,610
You've succeeded marvelously. I wish I
had your taste in carpets and pictures.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,840
You're much too kind, George.
Sit down, George.

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,850
- Thank you.
- I really haven't done very much.

25
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,350
The place is much the same
as it was when I moved in.

26
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,180
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

27
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,490
It's top secret and must go no further
than your chief of staff...

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,930
and not to him
unless you can trust his discretion.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,230
Of course.

30
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,740
A group of armies is forming on this
front for an offensive very soon.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,200
Headquarters is determined
to make a complete breakthrough.

32
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,570
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm really sorry.

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,080
I thought for a moment I knew what you
were going to say. Please go on.

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,580
What did you think
I was about to say?

35
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,880
- Something about the Ant Hill.
- You are a mind reader.

36
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,890
Well, it is a key position.

37
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,750
It's in my sector. To be perfectly
honest, I've heard some talk.

38
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,190
- There's nothing secret at headquarters.
- What do you think?

39
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,290
It's the key to the whole
German position in this sector.

40
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,330
They've held it for a year now...

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,870
and it looks as though they'll hold it
for another year if they want to.

42
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,560
I have formal orders to take
the Ant Hill no later than the tenth.

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,300
- That's the day after tomorrow.
- Don't you think that's ridiculous?

44
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,940
I don't imagine I'd be here
if I really thought that.

45
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,540
Paul, if there's one man in this army
who can do this for me, it's you.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,580
It's out of the question.
Absolutely.

47
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,680
My division was cut to pieces.

48
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,280
What's left is in no position to even
hold the Ant Hill, let alone take it.

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,490
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,830
Well, there was something else
I wanted to tell you...

51
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,960
however I'm sure you'll misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,700
- What was it?
- Oh, you'd be bound to misunderstand.

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,270
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

54
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,910
- What are you trying to say?
- Paul, the talk around headquarters...

55
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,780
is that you are being considered
for the 12th Corps.

56
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,620
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

57
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,620
I've pushed it all I can.

58
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,920
The 12th Corps needs a fighting general,
and your star is overdue.

59
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,150
We both know that your record
is good enough...

60
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,990
for you to refuse this assignment
on the grounds you've stated.

61
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,590
No one would question your opinion.
They'd simply get someone else to do it.

62
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,660
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion.

63
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,330
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks. Not before dinner.

64
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,480
I am responsible for the lives
of 8,000 men.

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,280
What is my ambition against that?

66
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,660
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

67
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,190
My men come first of all, George.

68
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,790
- And those men know it too.
- I know that.

69
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,960
You see, those men know
that I would never let them down.

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,700
That goes without saying.

71
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,330
One soldier's life means more to me
than all the decorations in France.

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,240
So, you think...

73
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,650
this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,050
I didn't say that, George.

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,750
Nothing is beyond those men
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

76
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,380
I don't want to push you
if you think it's ill-advised.

77
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't worry. You couldn't do that
if you tried.

78
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,660
Of course, artillery
would make an enormous difference.

79
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,930
- What artillery support can you give me?
- Well, I'll see.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,060
- What about replacements?
- We'll see what we can do...

81
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,370
but I feel sure that you can get along
with what you have.

82
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,380
We might just do it.

83
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,040
Paul, I knew that I was right
to come to you.

84
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,140
You are the man to take the Ant Hill.
As for that star...

85
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,310
That has nothing to do
with my decision!

86
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,320
If anything,
it would sway me the other way.

87
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,250
I realize that perfectly.

88
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,260
When do you see this coming off?

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,390
- No later than the day after tomorrow.
- We just might do it!

90
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,620
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

91
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,620
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name, soldier?

92
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,620
- Sir, Private Ferol, Company A.
- Aha. You married, Private?

93
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,420
- No, sir.
- I'll bet your mother's proud of you.

94
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,990
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Private, and good luck.

95
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you, sir.

96
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,470
- Morning, General.
- Good morning.

97
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,470
- Hello there, soldier.
- Sir.

98
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,670
- Ready to kill more Germans?
- Yes, sir.

99
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,680
Working over your rifle, I see.

100
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,270
That's the way.
The soldier's best friend.

101
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,580
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

102
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,590
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,310
Well, good luck to you, soldier.

104
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,330
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

105
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,710
Hello there, soldier.

106
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,260
Ready to kill more Germans?

107
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,450
Is everything all right, soldier?

108
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,590
All right. Yes, sir.
I'm all right.

109
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,130
Good fella.

110
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,190
- Are you married, soldier?
- Married? Me, married?

111
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,830
- Yes. Have you got a wife?
- A wife? Have I got a wife?

112
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,140
Sir. He's a bit shellshocked.

113
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,550
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

114
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,050
Have you got a wife, soldier?

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,710
My wife? My wife. Yes, I have a wife.

116
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm never gonna see her again.

117
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,260
Get a grip on yourself!
You're acting like a coward!

118
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,790
- I am a coward, sir.
- Snap out of it!

119
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,960
Sergeant, I want you to immediately
transfer this baby out of my regiment!

120
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,700
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him.

121
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,100
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

122
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,370
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

123
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,570
General, I'm convinced
that these tours of yours...

124
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,240
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men.

125
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,250
I think the fighting spirit
of the 701st derives from it.

126
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,150
No, Major. That spirit
was just born in them.

127
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,990
The general is coming, sir.

128
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,450
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
- I'm honored, General.

129
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,510
It's our privilege entirely.

130
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,580
Well, quite a neat little spot
you have here.

131
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,390
I'll reserve comment on the neatness,
sir, but it is little.

132
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,760
Pretty shy
on seating accommodations, though.

133
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,130
More than enough for me.
Never got the habit of sitting.

134
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,930
Like to be on my feet,
keep on the move.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,900
I can vouch for that. I can hardly
get him behind a desk to sign an order.

136
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,100
That's the way I am, you know, Dax.

137
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,110
I can't understand these
armchair officers...

138
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,270
fellows trying to fight from behind
a desk, waving papers at the enemy.

139
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,540
Worrying about whether a mouse is going
to run up their pants leg.

140
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,150
I don't know. If I could choose between
mice and Mausers, I'd take the mice.

141
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,280
You'll never make me believe that.

142
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,880
Seriously, though, if a man's a ninny...

143
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,590
let him put on a dress
and hide under the bed.

144
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,630
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then by heavens, he's got to be one.

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,860
He's got to fight. He can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

146
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,700
- That's my credo.
- I think I have to agree with you...

147
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,710
presenting your case
so convincingly, sir.

148
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,900
- You've never failed to live up to it.
- You'd like a look around?

149
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,710
Yes, Colonel.

150
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,540
Here's something to see.
The Ant Hill.

151
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,080
About as good a view as you can get
without actually being there.

152
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,920
Ha-ha. That won't be long now, will it?

153
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,650
Ah.

154
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,990
Yeah.

155
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,760
Well, I've seen much more formidable
objectives.

156
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,820
Much, much worse.

157
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,740
Well, not something
we can grab and run away with...

158
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,940
but certainly pregnable.

159
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,880
- Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it?
- Why?

160
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,210
Well, like something
to do with giving birth.

161
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,720
Oh, yes, quite. You're right on
your toes this morning, Colonel.

162
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,220
Even sharper than usual.
But we mustn't forget...

163
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,420
the colonel was perhaps the foremost
criminal lawyer in all France.

164
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,330
- Of course, General.
- Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

165
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,730
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

166
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,830
We drew some artillery.
Twenty-nine casualties, sir.

167
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,970
Yes, I noticed it on the road in.
Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

168
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,210
All swarmed together like flies,
just waiting for someone to swat them.

169
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,270
Well, they never learn, it seems. They
get in a tight spot under heavy fire...

170
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,910
gang up every time...
herd instinct, I suppose.

171
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,550
- Kind of a lower animal sort of thing.
- Kind of a human thing, it seems to me.

172
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,590
Don't you make a distinction between
the two, Major?

173
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,320
Oh, yes, very regrettable, of course.

174
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,890
Yes, indeed. Major, will you excuse us
for a few minutes?

175
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,060
Yes, sir. Of course.

176
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,570
Colonel.

177
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,840
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

178
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,850
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Ant Hill.

179
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,850
Colonel, your regiment is going to
take the Ant Hill tomorrow.

180
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,620
- You know the condition of my men, sir.
- Naturally, men are gonna be killed.

181
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,090
Possibly a lot of them.
They'll absorb bullets and shrapnel...

182
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,520
and by doing so make it possible
for others to get through.

183
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,860
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

184
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,690
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

185
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,500
Say, five percent killed by our own
barrage. That's a generous allowance.

186
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,940
Ten percent more in getting through
no-man's-land...

187
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,270
and 20 percent more
getting through the wire.

188
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,250
That leaves 65 percent
with the worst part of the job over.

189
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,310
Let's say another 25 percent
in actually taking the Ant Hill.

190
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,410
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

191
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,390
General, you're saying that
more than half my men will be killed.

192
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,220
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay,
Colonel.

193
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,700
- But we will have the Ant Hill.
- But will we, sir?

194
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,330
I'm depending on you, Colonel.
All France is depending on you.

195
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,410
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

196
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,080
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need
a flag waved to get me to charge.

197
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,120
I don't like your comparison of the flag
of France to a bullfighter's cape.

198
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,340
I meant nothing disrespectful
to the flag of France, sir.

199
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,950
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,
but a patriot is an honest man.

200
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,790
Not everyone has always thought so.
Samuel Johnson said something else.

201
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,290
What was that?

202
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,290
- Nothing, really.
- What do you mean, "Nothing, really"?

203
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,770
- Well, sir, nothing really important.
- When I ask a question, it's important.

204
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
- Now, who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

205
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,170
All right. What did he have to say
about patriotism?

206
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,470
He said it was the last refuge
of a scoundrel, sir. I'm sorry.

207
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,570
I meant nothing personal.

208
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,880
You're tired, Dax.
You're very tired.

209
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,390
It's you who are exhausted,
not your men, and it's my fault.

210
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,180
I've given you one impossible task
after another. You need rest badly.

211
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,520
- I haven't said that!
- And you never would, either.

212
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,750
Therefore you're not going to have
any say-so about it, Colonel.

213
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,520
I'm ordering you on indefinite furlough.

214
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,190
General, you can't take me away from
my men. You can't do that to me, sir!

215
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,900
Not to you, Dax. For you. For your good
and for the good of your men.

216
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,900
The good of my men, sir?

217
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,740
If an officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

218
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,940
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you,
but I must have enthusiastic support.

219
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,280
Not once have you said that your men
can take the Ant Hill.

220
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,250
We'll take the Ant Hill.

221
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,720
If any soldiers in the world
can take it...

222
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,160
we'll take the Ant Hill.

223
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,560
And when you do, your men will be
relieved and get a long rest.

224
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,540
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune
reporting, sir.

225
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,820
You took your time.

226
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,790
We prepared as quick as we could, sir.
We had to alert the sentries.

227
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,550
All right. You men, at ease.
This is a reconnaissance patrol.

228
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,460
German wire, machine gun posts,
identification of bodies.

229
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,930
There'll only be the three of us,
and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

230
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,300
We go out to the left, and we come back
through Post Six on the right.

231
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,100
- Is everything all clear at Post Six?
- All the sentries have been warned.

232
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,580
Number six will send up flares at
ten minute intervals starting at 0400.

233
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,510
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I told them that, sir.

234
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,950
The sergeant says every five minutes
is too much. It'll draw artillery.

235
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,080
Quite a strategist, this sergeant.
What's his name?

236
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,520
I don't know, sir.

237
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,890
All right. You men wait outside.
I'll join you in a minute.

238
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,520
Would you mind telling us
the password, sir?

239
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,070
- Calais.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,880
- He's fortifying himself.
- It smelled like heaven.

241
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,010
I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

242
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,980
Well, at least
he could have passed it around, the pig.

243
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,110
Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

244
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,780
We went to school together
before the war.

245
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,350
He thinks I don't have enough respect
for him. He's right.

246
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,060
You gentlemen are ready?

247
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,040
- Everything clear and understood?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,510
The lane through our wire
is right out in front here.

249
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,870
The machine guns are pointing
at the opening.

250
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,040
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.

251
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,510
All right, men. Let's go.

252
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,360
- What's that?
- I don't know.

253
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,800
Lejeune, move out and look that over.
We'll cover you.

254
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,240
Split up a night patrol?

255
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,240
Move out, Lejeune.

256
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,830
I don't like this.
Let's get out of here.

257
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,090
We haven't given him enough time.

258
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,970
- If we wait, they'll get us too.
- We've got to wait for him.

259
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,510
He must be dead.
Where is he?

260
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,010
- Well!
- Surprised, Lieutenant?

261
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,640
Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

262
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,580
You didn't wait around to find out,
did you, Lieutenant?

263
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,140
Look here. What do you mean?

264
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,480
I mean you ran like a rabbit
after you killed Lejeune.

265
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,120
Killed Lejeune?
What are you talking about?

266
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,660
I don't think I like your tone.

267
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,990
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

268
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,300
Oh, well, I must be mistaken, then, sir.

269
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,890
An officer wouldn't do that.

270
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,370
A man wouldn't do it.

271
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,370
Only a thing would.

272
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,380
A sneaky, booze-guzzling...

273
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,070
yellow-bellied rat
with a bottle for a brain...

274
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,780
- That's enough.
- And a streak of spit for a spine.

275
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,050
- You got yourself into a mess.
- Oh, I have?

276
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,650
Well, you've got yourself in a worse
one. First, general insubordination.

277
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,750
Second, threatening
your superior officer.

278
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,130
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

279
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,760
How do you think those charges
are going to look on paper?

280
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,030
Not half as bad as these.

281
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,090
Endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness...

282
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,170
drunk on duty, wanton murder
of one of your own men...

283
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,340
and cowardice in the face
of the enemy.

284
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,880
Phillip, have you ever tried
to bring charges against an officer?

285
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,750
It's my word against yours. Whose word
do you think they are going to believe?

286
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,880
Or let me put it another way.

287
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,890
Whose word are they going to accept?

288
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,450
I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

289
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,590
So far, all I have written
in this report...

290
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,200
is that you and Lejeune were killed
while out on patrol.

291
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,470
I'll fix this to read
that you made your way back...

292
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,840
after becoming separated
during the skirmish.

293
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,570
- That'll end the matter.
- You killed Lejeune. You know that.

294
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,340
- It was an accident.
- You threw that grenade.

295
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,080
I'd give anything if it hadn't happened.
That's the truth.

296
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,950
Honestly, I know you don't like me, but
what kind of a man do you think I am?

297
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,120
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

298
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,760
- I've been waiting for your report.
- We found out a thing or two.

299
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,560
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

300
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,760
- How'd it happen?
- It's in the report, sir.

301
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,960
- Let's have it.
- It isn't quite finished yet, sir.

302
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,100
That's all, Corporal.
You did a good night's work.

303
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,470
Should feel very proud of yourself.
Go get some sleep.

304
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,980
Yes, sir.

305
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,680
- How'd you lose Lejeune?
- Machine gun fire, sir.

306
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,690
He coughed. Almost got us all killed.

307
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,090
Finish that report and get it
to my dugout immediately.

308
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,590
Yes, sir.

309
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,370
The artillery starts at 0515.

310
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,430
The First Battalion
will move out at 0530.

311
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,700
When the leading elements
have cleared the German wires...

312
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,580
the second wave, consisting of
the Second and Third Battalions...

313
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,080
minus two companies in reserve,
will move out.

314
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,110
In no case later than 0540.

315
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,990
That's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

316
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,320
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery
preparation all that we can expect?

317
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,890
The feeling is that any more will give
them too much time to get organized.

318
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,160
What's the weather supposed to be like
tomorrow, sir?

319
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,340
Too good.

320
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,370
No chance of rain or fog?

321
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,910
The forecast is for sun all day.

322
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,380
Lf, or perhaps I should say when,
we take the Ant Hill...

323
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,420
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

324
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,910
General Mireau, who, by the way, will be
personally observing the attack...

325
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,860
has promised support from the 72nd
by sundown tomorrow...

326
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,120
which means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

327
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,620
Any more questions?

328
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,570
Well, gentlemen, good luck. I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

329
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,340
Let's get some sleep.

330
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,570
I'm not afraid of dying tomorrow,
only of getting killed.

331
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,580
- That's as clear as mud.
- Which would you rather be done in by?

332
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,350
- A bayonet or a machine gun?
- Machine gun, naturally.

333
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,190
That's my point. They're both pieces
of steel ripping into your guts...

334
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,060
only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

335
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,960
- What does that prove?
- That proves most of us...

336
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,190
are more afraid of getting hurt
than getting killed.

337
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,600
Look at Bernard. He panics when it comes
to gas. Gas doesn't bother me a bit.

338
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,230
He's seen photos of gas cases,
but it doesn't mean anything to me.

339
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,640
But I'll tell you something. I'd hate
like the devil to be without my tin hat.

340
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,300
But I don't mind not having a tin hat
for my tail.

341
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,750
- Why's that?
- That's where your brains are.

342
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,250
Because I know a wound to the head
will hurt more than one in the tail.

343
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,380
The tail is just meat, but the head...
the head is all bone.

344
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,790
- Speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

345
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,380
Aside from the bayonet,
what are you most afraid of?

346
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,720
- High explosives.
- Exactly. It's the same with me.

347
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,730
Because I know that it can chew you up
worse than anything else.

348
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,390
Look, it's like I'm trying to tell you.
If you're really afraid of dying...

349
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,490
you'd be living in a funk
all the rest of your life...

350
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,800
because you know you've got to go
someday, any day.

351
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,370
If death is what you really fear, why
should you care about what kills you?

352
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,000
You're too smart for me, Professor.
All I know is nobody wants to die.

353
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,820
Through to Division, sir.
Through to Polygon.

354
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,790
Everything quiet.
All units report themselves ready.

355
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,490
Zero minus two.

356
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,500
May I offer you gentlemen
some cognac?

357
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,000
Thank you, sir.

358
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,740
After you, sir.

359
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,880
To France.

360
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:43,810
Minus 15, 14, 13...

361
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,020
ten, nine, eight...

362
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,890
seven, six, five, four...

363
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,260
three, two, one, zero.

364
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,100
Sergeant, where's B Company?

365
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,110
I don't know, sir.

366
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,980
- Where in heaven's name are they?
- On the left, sir.

367
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,150
Where are the rest? Zero plus one,
and they're still in the trenches.

368
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,990
They're not advancing. Miserable
cowards! They're not advancing!

369
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,050
The barrage is getting away from them.
They're still in the trenches!

370
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,560
Yes, sir.

371
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,560
Captain Nichols.

372
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,100
Yes, sir?

373
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,000
Order the 75's to commence
firing on our own positions.

374
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,970
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

375
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,440
No, sir, but I respectfully
ask to...

376
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,780
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

377
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,780
No, sir.

378
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,820
- Then carry it out, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,660
Hello, Polygon?
This is Division.

380
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,670
Batteries One and Two commence firing...

381
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,730
on coordinates 32-58-78.

382
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,400
Batteries One and Two
to commence firing...

383
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,500
on coordinates 32-58-78, over.

384
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,020
General, the battery commander
reports those are our own positions.

385
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,680
He says it must be a mistake.

386
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,520
- Confirm the order, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,030
There is no mistake.
The order is confirmed.

388
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,000
Battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order...

389
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,730
unless it is in writing and signed
by the general, over.

390
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,040
General, battery commander reports
he cannot execute such an order...

391
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,310
unless it is in writing and signed
by the general.

392
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,440
- Give me that phone.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,350
General Mireau speaking.

394
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,220
Battery commander speaking, sir.

395
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,750
The troops are mutinying, refusing
to advance. Fire until further notice!

396
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,660
With all respect, sir, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men...

397
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,260
unless you are willing to take full
and undivided responsibility for it.

398
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,800
Captain Rousseau, are you going
to obey my order?

399
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,500
I must have a written order before
I can execute such a command, sir.

400
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,940
Supposing you are killed?
Then where will I be?

401
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,540
You'll be in front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning!

402
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,070
Hand over your command. Report yourself
under arrest to my headquarters!

403
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,890
Roget!

404
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,230
- Why are your men still in here?
- Impossible, sir. Major Vignon is dead.

405
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,460
Get these men out of the trenches!

406
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,440
Come on! Let's get ready for another
try! Get these men out of here!

407
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,770
I've tried three times!
Look at all the casualties.

408
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,610
All right, let's give it another try!
Come on!

409
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,190
It's impossible, sir.
All the men are falling back.

410
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Sir, I respectfully submit
to the colonel.

411
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:15,500
Pardon. Your remarks to me
were very unfair, sir.

412
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,270
It's just impossible.

413
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,040
General, according to first reports, the
attack has failed all along the line.

414
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,710
The men are falling back
to our own trenches.

415
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,590
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for the
immediate relief of the 701st Regiment.

416
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,530
Send them to the Chateau de L'aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to me.

417
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,720
Major Gouderc, assemble
a general court martial.

418
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,360
Have it ready to meet at 3:00
tomorrow afternoon.

419
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,390
If those sweethearts won't face German
bullets, they'll face French ones!

420
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,170
I ordered an attack.
Your troops refused to attack.

421
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,740
Our troops did attack, sir,
but they could make no headway.

422
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,350
Because they didn't try. I saw it
myself. Half never left the trenches.

423
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,330
A third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense.

424
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,020
Don't quibble over fractions.
The fact remains...

425
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,900
a good part of your men
never left their own trenches.

426
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,670
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have ten men
from each company in your regiment...

427
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,500
tried under penalty of death
for cowardice.

428
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,170
- Penalty of death?
- For cowardice!

429
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,470
They've skim milk in their veins
instead of blood.

430
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,450
It's the reddest milk I've ever seen.
My trenches are soaked with it!

431
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,680
- That's just about enough out of you.
- I'm not gonna mince words...

432
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,350
If you continue in this manner, I shall
be forced to place you under arrest.

433
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,090
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it rather bluntly.

434
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,790
This is not a trial, but it does
bear certain aspects of one...

435
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,260
and Colonel Dax technically
is cast in the role of the defense.

436
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:51,000
In view of the charges, a court would
grant latitude in presenting his case.

437
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,270
Latitude is one thing,
insubordination another.

438
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,400
I am merely offering an opinion,
General.

439
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,570
Please do not feel constrained
to accept it.

440
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,510
I'm perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

441
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,310
I'm sorry, sir. I certainly didn't
intend to be insubordinate.

442
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,360
My only aim is to remind you
of the heroism these men have shown...

443
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,480
on every occasion in the past.

444
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,460
We're not talking about the past.
We're talking about the present.

445
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,020
But don't you see, sir?
They're not cowards.

446
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,260
If some didn't leave the trenches,
it must have been impossible.

447
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,900
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

448
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,870
We can't leave it up to the men
to decide whether an order is possible.

449
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,040
If it was impossible, the only proof
of that would be their dead bodies...

450
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,550
lying in the trenches.

451
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,640
They're scum, Colonel.

452
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,350
The whole rotten regiment is a pack of
sneaking, whining, tail-dragging curs.

453
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,850
Do you really believe that?

454
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,220
Yes, I do.
That's exactly what I believe.

455
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,260
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

456
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,490
Why not shoot the entire regiment?
I'm perfectly serious.

457
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,030
You're missing the point entirely. We
don't want to slaughter the French army.

458
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,040
All we want
is to set an example.

459
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,440
Oh, if it's an example you want,
then take me.

460
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,940
- Take you?
- Yes, sir. If you want an example...

461
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,640
one man will do as well as a hundred.

462
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,210
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

463
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,380
Come, Colonel.
I think you're overwrought.

464
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,080
This is not a question of officers.

465
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,280
Paul, we don't want to overdo
this thing.

466
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,990
Suppose we just make it a dozen.

467
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,160
I was talking of a hundred men.
Now we're down to 12.

468
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,630
Paul, let's not haggle over this
anymore.

469
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,760
Let's get it settled once and for all,
so we can all live with it.

470
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,910
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see proper justice meted out.

471
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,070
I've spent my entire life in the army.

472
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,550
I've always tried to be true
to my principles.

473
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,550
It's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

474
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,750
I'll settle for this:

475
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,420
Have the company commanders select one
man from each company in the first wave.

476
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,430
- Three in all.
- Well, that's very reasonable, Paul.

477
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,330
The court martial will meet
at the chateau at 3:00 this afternoon.

478
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,030
- Will that be convenient for you?
- I won't be there, Paul.

479
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,500
You won't be there?

480
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,000
No. I think it best that you handle
this matter on your own.

481
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,040
Probably so.

482
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,600
General Mireau, if it's possible...

483
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,940
I'd like to be appointed counsel
for the accused.

484
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,710
I'll take it under consideration.

485
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,680
Oh, we can permit that.
Consider it settled, Colonel.

486
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,780
Thank you, sir.

487
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,490
Noon straight up, Paul. I hope that
you can stay for lunch, Colonel.

488
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,620
George, I'm afraid the colonel
won't have time.

489
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,560
Don't deny it, Paul,
you've been hiding this man.

490
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,100
Keeping him for your own.
I think that was very selfish of you.

491
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,370
Thank you, General, but I'm afraid there
isn't much time between now and 3:00.

492
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,370
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

493
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,090
- Yes, Captain? What is it?
- You ordered me to report to you, sir.

494
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,230
- Captain Rousseau, Battery Commander.
- Yes, of course.

495
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,140
I wanted to speak to you about
some of your shells falling short.

496
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,440
I haven't time now. Report back
to your command until further orders.

497
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,940
Yes, sir.

498
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,580
- Bad stuff. It demoralizes the men.
- I quite agree with you.

499
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,310
The best solution is to shelve him
to another outfit.

500
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,450
A court of inquiry ought to roast him
a bit first.

501
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,020
Well, in cases like shells falling
short, I always try to avoid an inquiry.

502
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,530
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

503
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,900
Shelving will be the best discipline
for him in my opinion.

504
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,940
- Perhaps you're right.
- Oh, would you excuse me for a moment?

505
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,940
A regimental matter for the colonel.

506
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,370
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

507
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,970
There'll be Captain Sancy,
Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

508
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,910
- Yes, sir.
- Have them meet me in half an hour.

509
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,920
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel Dax?

510
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,810
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like a word.

511
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,250
Certainly, sir.

512
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,920
- Let's be sensible about this.
- Sensible, sir?

513
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,930
Listen to me, Dax. You can cut out
this fancy talk with me, understand?

514
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,830
General Broulard seemed to think
you're funny. I don't.

515
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,130
- I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon. Is that an order?

516
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,010
Colonel Dax, when this mess
is cleaned up, I'll break you!

517
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,070
I'll find an excuse,
and I'll break you to the ranks.

518
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,010
I'll ruin you. It will be
just what you deserve...

519
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,640
showing such little loyalty
to your commanding officer.

520
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,780
That's all, Colonel.

521
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,670
General Mireau feels that the attack
on the Ant Hill yesterday morning...

522
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,440
failed because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the First Battalion.

523
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,920
Each of you is to select one man
from your company...

524
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:11,720
place him under arrest and have him
appear before a general court martial...

525
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,490
no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.

526
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,890
The charge is cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

527
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,950
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

528
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,290
But Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune
on that patrol...

529
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,760
and then blackmailed me
into keeping quiet about it!

530
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,380
- That's why he picked me!
- Corporal, I understand your feelings.

531
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,160
But that has nothing to do with
the charges you're being tried for.

532
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,100
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do.

533
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,830
But who else will?
You've got no witnesses.

534
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,800
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonize the court.

535
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,400
When we get clear of this, I'm going
into the story of that patrol again.

536
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,380
Sir, in my case, Captain Renouart
had the sergeant draw lots.

537
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,570
I was picked purely by chance.

538
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,120
You were lucky. Look at me.

539
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,680
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

540
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,020
Me, a social undesirable.

541
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,720
I didn't act like a coward.
Picking by lots! Is that fair?

542
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,920
Gentlemen!

543
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,730
You've all got to understand that the
reason you were picked is immaterial.

544
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,790
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

545
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,440
Stick to your stories, and don't let
the prosecutor shake you out of them.

546
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,000
Now remember, you'll be soldiers
in the presence of superior officers...

547
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,020
so act like what you are.

548
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,880
Soldiers.

549
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,440
And brave ones at that.

550
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,920
I've been in the room you'll be sitting
in. The sun will be in your faces...

551
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,330
so don't let it seem as if you're
dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

552
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,000
When you answer questions,
look the judges in the eye.

553
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,000
Don't whine, plead or make speeches.
That's my job.

554
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,060
Simple statements. Short.

555
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,130
But make them so they can be heard
all over the room.

556
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,200
And try not to repeat yourselves.
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

557
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,710
We haven't much time. The court martial
begins in about an hour.

558
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,710
I've got notes to look at.

559
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,850
Good luck.

560
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,850
Thank you, Colonel.

561
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,530
The court martial is opened.
Prisoners may be seated.

562
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,810
This is a general court martial. We'll
dispense with unnecessary formalities.

563
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,470
These men are charged with cowardice
in the face of the enemy...

564
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,980
and will be tried for that offense.

565
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,310
Mr. Prosecutor.

566
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,650
Call the accused, Private Ferol.

567
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,820
Mr. President, will the prosecutor...

568
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,660
question the witnesses
without even reading the indictment?

569
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,290
Please don't take up the court's time
with technicalities.

570
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,170
The indictment is lengthy
and there's no point in reading it.

571
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,800
- The defense has a right...
- The indictment is...

572
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,500
that the accused showed cowardice
in the face of the enemy...

573
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,740
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

574
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,780
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

575
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,610
Call the accused, Private Ferol.

576
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,460
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir?

577
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,590
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Ant Hill?

578
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,860
- Yes, sir.
- Did you refuse to advance?

579
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,900
No, sir.

580
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,060
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

581
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,700
How far did you advance?

582
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,040
- To about the middle of no-man's-land.
- Then what did you do?

583
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,450
There were machine gun bullets
landing all around...

584
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,110
Answer the question.
What did you do?

585
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,550
Well, I saw that me and Meyer...

586
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,780
I didn't ask what you saw.

587
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,890
The court has no concern
with your visual experiences.

588
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,300
- My what, sir?
- You will reply to the question.

589
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,100
Yes, sir. What question was it?

590
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:53,100
You advanced to the middle of
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

591
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,870
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

592
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,930
- I went back, sir.
- In other words, Private Ferol...

593
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,610
you retreated.

594
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,180
Yes, sir.

595
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,910
That's all. The accused
may return to his seat.

596
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,250
Just a minute.

597
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,950
Mr. President, I'd like to question
the witness, if I may.

598
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,690
Proceed, Colonel.

599
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,560
Thank you. Private Ferol, when you
reached the middle of no-man's-land...

600
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,600
were you alone with Private Meyer?

601
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,860
Yes, sir.

602
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,170
What happened to the rest
of your company?

603
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,680
Well, I don't know, sir. I guess the
rest of them had been killed or wounded.

604
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,740
You found yourself in the middle of
no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer?

605
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,010
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn't you attack single-handed?

606
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,120
Why didn't you storm the Ant Hill alone?

607
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,390
Just me and Meyer? You're kidding, sir.

608
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,730
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.
Thank you. That's all.

609
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,530
I don't see the point of this line
of questioning.

610
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,000
Well, I'm attempting to indicate, sir,
the utter absurdity...

611
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,600
of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

612
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,080
Mr. Prosecutor.

613
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,580
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated?

614
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,410
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

615
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,610
I knew we should have took Ant Hill,
but we came on back.

616
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,960
That's all.

617
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,250
The accused may return to his seat.

618
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,740
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

619
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:43,580
Yes, sir, until I was ordered back
to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

620
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,740
How far did you advance?

621
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,750
Into the wire, sir.

622
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:51,620
The enemy wire, I suppose.

623
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,620
No, sir. It was our wire.

624
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:00,430
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

625
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,470
No, sir. I didn't.

626
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,200
How far would you say that was?
How many meters?

627
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,930
Well, I advanced as far as I could.

628
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,200
How many meters?

629
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,440
Not many.

630
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,420
Not many?

631
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,040
Now, Private Arnaud...

632
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,520
before you were ordered back...

633
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,960
did you urge your fellow soldiers
forward?

634
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,960
Most were dead or wounded before they
got three steps beyond the trenches.

635
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,400
Reply to the question.

636
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,060
I didn't urge them on.
No, sir.

637
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,210
Thank you.

638
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,510
Private Arnaud, at ease, please.

639
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,720
Aside from your sad failure to give
throat to spirited battle cries...

640
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,760
was your behavior different
in any respect...

641
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,690
from that of the other men?

642
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,590
Objection.
That's a matter of conjecture.

643
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,860
Sustained.

644
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,770
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

645
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,200
No, sir.

646
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,670
Is it true that you've been designated
a coward...

647
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,370
simply and purely because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

648
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,380
Yes, sir.

649
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,540
I don't see that that's significant.

650
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,450
It's accepted practice in the French
army to pick examples by lot.

651
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,040
Since this entire company advanced
only a few meters...

652
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,090
picking by lot was eminently fair
in this case.

653
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,960
Well, I'd like to point out that this
soldier has distinguished himself...

654
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,400
in some of the bloodiest battles
of the war.

655
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,520
With the court's permission,
I'll read citations for bravery...

656
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,970
that he's already earned on
two occasions.

657
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,770
First, citations
in the Orders in the Army for bravery...

658
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,300
That's immaterial. The accused is not
being tried for his former bravery...

659
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,370
but for his recent cowardice.

660
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,780
Medals are no defense.

661
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,620
May I call witnesses to his character?

662
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,490
You may not.

663
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,220
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

664
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,900
Mr. President, no one
in the entire regiment...

665
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:16,160
got anywhere near the German wire,
including myself.

666
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,060
Call the next accused.

667
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,370
If you're through, Colonel.

668
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,930
Thank you.

669
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,270
The prisoner
may return to his seat.

670
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:39,320
- So you never even left the trenches?
- No, sir.

671
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,690
That's all.

672
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,890
Corporal Paris,
why didn't you leave the trenches?

673
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,260
Major Vignon was shot, and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

674
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:56,140
And were you lying unconscious in
the trenches during the entire attack?

675
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:57,980
Yes, sir.

676
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,580
- That's all.
- Have you any witnesses?

677
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:08,650
No. Everybody was too busy to notice me,
and there were many others lying dead.

678
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,680
- But you have no witnesses?
- No, sir.

679
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,660
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

680
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,920
That could've been
self-inflicted later.

681
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,500
Thank you.
You may stand down.

682
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,540
Mr. Prosecutor,
you can make your plea.

683
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,950
Gentlemen of the court...

684
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,950
this case speaks
for itself.

685
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,960
All of us witnessed the
regrettable attack yesterday morning.

686
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:52,930
And I submit
that that attack...

687
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,430
was a stain
on the flag of France...

688
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,800
a blot on the honor...

689
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:02,240
of every man, woman and child
in the French nation.

690
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,940
It is to us that the sad...

691
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:13,750
distressing,
repellent duty falls, gentlemen.

692
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,050
I ask this court...

693
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,090
to find the accused guilty...

694
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,760
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the code of military justice.

695
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,570
Thank you.

696
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,170
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

697
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,750
Gentlemen of the court,
there are times when I'm ashamed...

698
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,020
to be a member of the human race,
and this is one such occasion.

699
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,860
It's impossible for me to summarize
the case for the defense since...

700
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:03,590
the court never allowed me a reasonable
opportunity to present my case.

701
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,600
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

702
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,270
Yes, sir.

703
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,310
I protest against being prevented
from introducing evidence...

704
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,840
that I consider
vital to the defense.

705
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,780
The prosecution
presented no witnesses.

706
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,750
There has never been a written
indictment of charges...

707
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,190
made against the defendants.

708
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,950
And lastly I protest
against the fact that...

709
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,000
no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

710
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:45,670
The attack yesterday morning
was no stain on the honor of France...

711
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,550
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

712
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,980
But this court martial
is such a stain...

713
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,820
and such a disgrace.

714
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,850
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

715
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,460
Gentlemen of the court...

716
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:06,400
to find these men guilty
would be a crime...

717
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,690
to haunt each of you
till the day you die.

718
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:20,140
I can't believe
that the noblest impulse of man...

719
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:24,270
his compassion for another...
can be completely dead here.

720
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,550
Therefore I humbly beg you...

721
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,220
show mercy to these men.

722
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:41,530
The accused
will be escorted back to the guard room.

723
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,560
The hearing is closed.
The court will now retire to deliberate.

724
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,210
There will be a guard
of six men under arms.

725
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:51,710
Rifles loaded, bayonets fixed,
two men to each prisoner.

726
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,110
Any sign of trouble, the prisoners
will be instantly covered...

727
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,120
and if the trouble doesn't subside
at once, the prisoner will be shot.

728
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,650
Everything must go off without a hitch
with the least possible delay.

729
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,550
It shouldn't be hurried.
There must be no fumbling around.

730
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,820
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible...

731
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,890
for any lack of order
or any mistakes.

732
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,060
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame and with interest...

733
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:20,870
to any one of you
who fails in his duties.

734
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,770
The execution
will take place at 7:00...

735
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,780
according to the verdict
of the court martial.

736
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,280
Detail, attention!
Dismissed!

737
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,090
- This is compliments of General Mireau.
- Duck!

738
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,400
- Well, tell him thanks.
- Don't blame me, soldier.

739
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,700
Hey, ugly, what are we supposed
to eat this with, our fingers?

740
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:58,540
The guard says
you can't have any knives or forks.

741
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,770
Is this supposed to be
our last meal or something?

742
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,800
It isn't supposed to be our last meal.
It is our last meal.

743
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,110
This duck is terrific.

744
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,620
You suppose
they'd put anything in the food?

745
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,160
First they poison us,
then they shoot us?

746
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,920
- I think they put something in it.
- Like what?

747
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,130
Like, uh... like something
to make us groggy or something.

748
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,400
What would be wrong with that
if they did?

749
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,000
Maybe nothing for you, but I'm
going to get out of this somehow.

750
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,800
- And I don't want to be drugged.
- How are you going to get out?

751
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,140
Chew your way
through that stone wall?

752
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,220
Colonel Dax,
he'll see us through.

753
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,220
Listen, we got to get out of here.
They're going to kill us if we don't.

754
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,850
- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's got to be a way.

755
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,820
How many guys you think
they've got out there?

756
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,660
They may have a couple of squads. That's
what it sounded like this morning.

757
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,030
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the Third Battalion.

758
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,440
Anyway, right now
we have no friends.

759
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,470
Why kid yourself?
We're not going to get out of this.

760
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,530
Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

761
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,850
You see that cockroach?

762
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,110
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

763
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,250
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

764
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,290
I'll be nothing,
and it'll be alive.

765
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,330
Now you got the edge on him.

766
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,600
Good evening, my sons.
I'm Father Du Pres.

767
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:39,540
- Is there any news?
- Yes, I'm afraid I bring you bad news.

768
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,440
You must prepare for the worst.
Colonel Dax asked me to tell you.

769
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,140
- Oh, mercy, no!
- He's been in telephone contact...

770
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,620
with army headquarters but unable
to speak to General Broulard...

771
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,620
or to anyone in authority.

772
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:54,060
The same way at Division.
No one wants to be found.

773
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,890
- How much time do we have?
- You have plenty of time yet.

774
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,230
Certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves.

775
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,370
Father, will you
take this letter, please?

776
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,450
- Of course, my son.
- It's to my wife.

777
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,610
She won't understand this,
and I tried to explain it to her.

778
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,620
I'll see that she gets it.

779
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:28,590
Do you want me
to hear your confession?

780
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:33,100
Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

781
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,670
I know you're trying to help,
and I appreciate it...

782
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,730
but if I started praying now
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

783
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,770
Oh, that's an error, my son.

784
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,970
God is always ready
to listen to your prayers.

785
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,140
All right, Father.
Will you please hear my confession?

786
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,410
Yes.

787
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,480
Have faith in your creator, my son.
Death comes to us all.

788
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,390
In the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

789
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,860
That's really deep:
"Death comes to us all."

790
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,230
That really is deep.

791
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,920
Ferol, afraid your luck
isn't going to hold up?

792
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,090
Look! This is my religion.

793
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,500
Oh, great bottle, forgive me my sins,
for now I lay me down to sleep.

794
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,040
Bo-peep. May I drink of you first?
Thank you. Amen.

795
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:20,510
I understand your anguish, my son, but
you must not let it harden your heart.

796
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,770
May I tell you something, Father?

797
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,870
Back in my hometown,
there was a certain little cafe...

798
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,380
with an amusing sign
over the bar.

799
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,480
It read,

800
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,990
"Do not be afraid to ask for credit,
for our way of refusing is very polite."

801
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,890
- Come on. Sit down. You're drunk.
- Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

802
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,990
Can you get out of here
with your sanctimonious, pat answers?

803
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,430
- Are you hanging around to torture us?
- No, to help you with all my power.

804
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,660
- Your power? You have no power!
- No, but God has power.

805
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,400
- Does he? What a laugh!
- You can be saved.

806
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,200
Saved? I'll be saved?

807
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,410
Cut it out, Arnaud!

808
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:10,350
Father, get a doctor.
Quick.

809
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:22,300
That should keep him quiet long enough.
That's a nasty skull fracture, though.

810
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:25,770
- He may not live out the night.
- What are we supposed to do with him?

811
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,610
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher
so he won't slip when you tilt it.

812
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,710
Surely they won't execute
a man in that condition.

813
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:37,310
The sentence will be carried out.
I've already checked with the general.

814
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,350
If he's still alive in the morning,
pinch his cheeks a couple of times.

815
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,330
It may make him open his eyes.
The general wants him to be conscious.

816
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,820
Yes?

817
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,390
- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in.

818
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,960
Sergeant Boulanger
said you wanted to see me, sir.

819
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,410
Yes. We have a pretty unpleasant thing
on our hands in a few hours.

820
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:05,240
- You mean the execution?
- Yes.

821
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,380
Yes, sir.
It's very unfortunate.

822
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,920
Very unfortunate.
That's just how I feel about it.

823
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:13,690
- None of us are happy about it, sir.
- How'd you happen...

824
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,590
to pick Corporal Paris?

825
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,600
L... I had to pick somebody, sir.

826
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,360
That's right. Of course,
you had no personal motive...

827
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,630
in picking Paris,
did you?

828
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,600
You picked him
because he was a coward, didn't you?

829
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,600
Did you or didn't you?

830
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,700
Yes, sir. I did.

831
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:38,210
Well, like you say,
somebody had to be picked.

832
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,950
- It was quite a problem, sir.
- Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

833
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,850
I have to pick someone to be in charge
of the firing squad tomorrow.

834
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,150
Do you have any objections
to taking the job?

835
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:50,890
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

836
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,990
Don't you feel well?

837
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,500
We... No... Yeah, I feel all right, sir.
It's just that I...

838
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,370
l-ls it too hot in here?
Would you like me to open a window?

839
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:07,700
Well, it's just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

840
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,320
There's nothing to it. First you help
the sergeant tie the men to the post...

841
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:18,380
and offer the men blindfolds...
if they want them, you tie them on.

842
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:21,690
Now, you take your position with
the firing squad, you raise your sword:

843
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,820
Ready, aim, fire.

844
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,090
Then you draw your revolver out,
walk forward...

845
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,500
and put a bullet
through each man's head.

846
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:35,170
Sir, I request that I be excused
from this duty.

847
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,300
Request denied.

848
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:40,310
- Colonel, I...
- You've got the job. It's all yours.

849
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,310
- That's all.
- Colonel, if you could just...

850
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,680
That's all!

851
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,350
Yes?

852
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,390
Excuse me, sir.
Colonel Dax?

853
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:51,010
- Yes?
- My name is Rousseau, sir.

854
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,560
- Captain of Artillery.
- What is it, Captain?

855
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:03,700
I have something to tell you that may
have a bearing on the court martial.

856
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,390
Come in.

857
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,990
Colonel. Good evening.

858
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,360
- Good evening.
- Come and sit down.

859
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:08,660
Thank you, sir. L... I'm really sorry
to intrude on you in this way.

860
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,900
Not at all. Always delighted to see you,
Colonel Dax. Will you have a cigar?

861
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:14,160
No, thank you, sir.

862
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,470
- Well, I...
- Think you'll find it delicious.

863
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,010
I must apologize for not inviting you
to the party tonight...

864
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,410
but I'm afraid that it's
a dress affair.

865
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,280
Thank you, sir,
but I must confess...

866
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:28,790
that this is not entirely
a social visit.

867
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:33,410
Come, Dax.
Let's not go over all that ground again.

868
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,990
Though, I must admit
that judging...

869
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,090
from the casualties, the efforts of your
regiment must have been considerable.

870
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,570
How can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

871
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,500
Come, Colonel, you're choosing
to take a rather simple view of this.

872
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:50,910
The attack was impossible.
The general staff must have known that.

873
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:56,510
Colonel Dax, we think
we're doing a good job running the war.

874
01:05:56,580 --> 01:06:00,540
You must be aware the general staff
is subject to unfair pressures...

875
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,640
from newspapers and politicians.

876
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,660
Maybe the attack against the Ant Hill
was impossible.

877
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,880
Perhaps it was an error of judgment
on our part.

878
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,060
On the other hand, if your men had been
more daring, they might have taken it.

879
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,620
Who knows? In any case...

880
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:18,500
why should we have to bear any more
criticism than we have to?

881
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:22,100
Aside from the fact that many of
your men never left the trenches...

882
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,640
there's the troops' morale,
don't forget.

883
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,670
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

884
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,680
These executions will be a perfect tonic
for the entire division.

885
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,340
There are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating...

886
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,280
than seeing someone else die.

887
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,340
- I never thought of that, sir.
- Colonel, troops are like children.

888
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,050
Just as a child wants his father
to be firm, troops crave discipline.

889
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:45,030
One way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

890
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,560
May I ask...

891
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,600
do you sincerely believe
the things you've said?

892
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,480
It's been a pleasure
discussing this with you, Colonel...

893
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,940
but I'm afraid that I'd better
be getting back to my guests.

894
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:04,950
Forgive me for having kept you
from your party.

895
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,680
Oh, by the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau...

896
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,120
ordered his own battery commander,
Captain Rousseau...

897
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:17,390
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

898
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,200
Of course, the captain refused
without a written order.

899
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,670
But General Mireau demanded that
he commence firing on our own trenches.

900
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,110
Well, again, Rousseau refused
without an order in writing...

901
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:35,440
but again he was ordered
and again he refused...

902
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,240
all in front of witnesses.

903
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,050
Do you actually
believe this fantastic story?

904
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:44,250
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

905
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,020
Battery Commander Rousseau, Captain
Nichols, the artillery spotter...

906
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:51,930
the telephone clerk
and my own deposition.

907
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,130
What has this got to do with the charge
against the condemned prisoners?

908
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,860
A general in a tantrum over the failure
of an impossible attack...

909
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,700
orders his artillery
to fire on his own men.

910
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:07,610
The same officer on the same day
orders a court martial...

911
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,640
in which three of his men
are sentenced to be shot.

912
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:16,850
General, what would your newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

913
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,650
- Are you trying to blackmail me?
- Sir, that's an ugly word...

914
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,490
but you are in a difficult position.

915
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,660
Too much has happened. Someone's
got to be hurt. The question is whom.

916
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:33,760
General Mireau's
assault on the Ant Hill failed.

917
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:37,640
His order to fire on his own troops
was refused.

918
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:40,110
But his attempt
to murder three innocent men...

919
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:44,610
to protect his own reputation will be
prevented by the general staff.

920
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:56,120
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax?
I've been rude to my guests too long.

921
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,290
Detail, halt!

922
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,250
Order, arms!

923
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,260
Fall out.

924
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,780
Courage, my sons.
The worst is over.

925
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,800
Good morning, Paris.

926
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,670
Good morning, Sergeant.
How are you today?

927
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,470
Not too bad. How are you?

928
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:25,910
You missed some good chow
in here last night.

929
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,350
What did you have?

930
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,550
Have you got a drink for us?

931
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,090
Take a swig of this.

932
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:42,890
It just occurred to me.
Funny thing. L...

933
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,870
I haven't had one sexual thought
since the court martial.

934
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:49,100
It's pretty extraordinary,
isn't it?

935
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,000
Act like a man.

936
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,900
- Listen, Paris. Are you listening?
- Yes.

937
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:58,070
There will be a lot of dignitaries,
newspapermen out there.

938
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:00,240
How do you want to be remembered?

939
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,610
- I don't want to die.
- Many of us will be joining you...

940
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,210
before this war's over.

941
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,790
I don't care.
I don't want to die.

942
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:13,320
- Please save me, Sergeant.
- I can't save you. No one can now.

943
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,660
This is the last decision
you'll have a chance to make on earth.

944
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,330
You can act like a man,
or we'll have to drag you out of here.

945
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,340
In the end, it will all be the same.
It's up to you.

946
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:45,560
Let's get busy. You and Ferol take your
coats off. No use hanging around here.

947
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:06,340
...with the help of Thy grace
to do penance...

948
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,940
to amend my life.

949
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,690
What do I have to die for, Father?

950
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,960
What do I have to die for?
I didn't do anything wr...

951
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,060
We do not question
the will of God, my son.

952
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:32,370
But I fought. I fought.
I fought on the battlefield.

953
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,900
Why don't they die?
Why don't they put them to death?

954
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,480
You showed courage in the face
of the enemy, my son.

955
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,450
Show it now before your own troops.

956
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,950
But I'm scared.
I'm scared.

957
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:47,310
Oh, Father, I'm scared.

958
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:50,790
Courage. Brace yourself.
Man, brace yourself.

959
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,370
He said, "This day,
thou shalt be with me in paradise."

960
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,340
- Really, Father?
- Yes, my son.

961
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:11,840
I'll never see my wife again,
Father.

962
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:16,610
I'll never see nobody again,
Father.

963
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:19,090
Courage, man.
Brace yourself.

964
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,750
- I can't help it.
- Brace yourself, man.

965
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:26,850
- I can't help it, Father.
- Oh, God, Almighty God.

966
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,800
- Oh, Christ. Strengthen me, God!
- Grant courage to this man...

967
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,600
who is about to die.

968
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,180
What do I have to die for,
Father?

969
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,740
What do I have to die for?

970
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,650
Forward, face!

971
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,720
Secure the men!

972
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,500
Detail, attention!

973
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,100
Forward, march!

974
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,170
Detail...

975
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:22,740
halt!

976
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:24,880
Left, face!

977
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,980
Repent.

978
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,190
In the name of the French people...

979
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:06,350
Corporal Phillip Paris,
Private Maurice Ferol...

980
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,760
and Private Pierre Arnaud
of the 701st Regiment...

981
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:15,900
having been found guilty of cowardice
in the face of the enemy...

982
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:19,200
are to be executed
by rifle fire immediately...

983
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:23,140
in accordance with the judgment
of the military court martial.

984
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,730
You want a blindfold?

985
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:59,250
Yes, Lieutenant. Please.

986
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,420
I don't want to die.

987
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:22,360
Did... Did you want a blindfold?

988
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,210
I'm sorry.

989
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:52,370
Oh, Father.

990
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,770
Ready!

991
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:10,980
Aim!

992
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,720
Fire!

993
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,730
I'm awfully glad
you could be there, George.

994
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,600
This sort of thing
is always rather grim.

995
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,790
But this had splendor,
don't you think?

996
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,340
I have never seen an affair
of this sort handled any better.

997
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:32,440
The men died wonderfully.
There's always that chance...

998
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,770
that one will do something that
will leave everyone with a bad taste.

999
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:37,580
This time,
you couldn't ask for better.

1000
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,640
Yes?

1001
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:44,350
- Yes, Colonel?
- You wanted to see me, sir.

1002
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,690
Oh, yes. Come in, Colonel.
Come in and sit down.

1003
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,190
Colonel,
your men died very well.

1004
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,800
- Would you like some coffee, Colonel?
- No, thank you, sir.

1005
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:02,770
Paul, it's been brought to my attention
that you ordered your artillery...

1006
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,210
to fire on your own men
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

1007
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:10,200
I did what?
Who told you that?

1008
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,370
Colonel Dax came to me last night
with the story.

1009
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,090
I've always known you were
a disloyal officer...

1010
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:23,520
but I never dreamed you would stoop
to anything so low as this.

1011
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:27,890
I've sworn statements from Captain
Nichols, your artillery spotter...

1012
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,730
Captain Rousseau, the battery commander
who refused your order.

1013
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,070
I think it's
absolutely infamous.

1014
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,400
Then there's no truth to the charge
made by Colonel Dax?

1015
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,870
I don't see
how you could even ask me that.

1016
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,380
You cannot imagine
how glad I am to hear that, Paul.

1017
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:42,970
I'm certain
you'll come through it all right.

1018
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,550
- I'll come through what?
- There'll have to be an inquiry.

1019
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:49,240
- An inquiry?
- Those things, the public forgets.

1020
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,190
- Public?
- You've got to clear your name.

1021
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:57,690
You cannot allow such vile insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

1022
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:59,730
So that's it.

1023
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,870
You're making me the goat.

1024
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:05,930
The only completely innocent man
in this whole affair.

1025
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,800
I have only one last thing
to say to you, George.

1026
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:17,610
The man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier.

1027
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,950
Well...

1028
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,150
it had to be done.

1029
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,560
France cannot afford to have fools
guiding her military destiny.

1030
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:37,660
I'm grateful to you for having
brought this matter to my attention.

1031
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:41,200
Colonel, how would you like
General Mireau's job?

1032
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,370
- His what?
- His job.

1033
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,080
Let me get this straight, sir.

1034
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:51,980
You're offering me
General Mireau's command?

1035
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:54,880
Come, come, Colonel Dax.
Don't overdo the surprise.

1036
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:58,290
You've been after the job from
the start. We all know that, my boy.

1037
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:02,380
I may be many things, sir,
but I am not your boy.

1038
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:05,430
Well, I certainly didn't mean
to imply any biological relationship.

1039
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,520
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- Are you trying to provoke me, Colonel?

1040
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,760
- Why should I want to do that?
- Exactly. It would be a pity...

1041
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,600
to lose your promotion
before you get it.

1042
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:15,870
A promotion
you have so very carefully planned for.

1043
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:20,810
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

1044
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,310
Colonel, you will apologize at once
or shall be placed under arrest!

1045
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,450
I apologize
for not being entirely honest with you.

1046
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,350
I apologize
for not revealing my true feelings.

1047
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,590
I apologize
for not telling you sooner...

1048
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,630
that you're a degenerate,
sadistic old man.

1049
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:43,600
And you can go to hell before I
apologize to you now or ever again!

1050
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:50,400
Colonel Dax,
you're a disappointment to me.

1051
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:54,500
You've spoiled the keenness of your mind
by wallowing in sentimentality.

1052
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:56,640
You really did want
to save those men...

1053
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,550
and you were
not angling for Mireau's command.

1054
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:03,450
You're an idealist, and I pity you
as I would the village idiot.

1055
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,990
We're fighting a war,
a war that we've got to win.

1056
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,060
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

1057
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,560
You bring charges against General
Mireau, so I insist he answer them.

1058
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:14,760
Wherein have I done wrong?

1059
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:21,770
Because you don't know the answer
to that question...

1060
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,770
I pity you.

1061
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,840
Thank you.

1062
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,300
Now, gentlemen,
we have a special entertainment...

1063
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:56,810
for you.

1064
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,380
Sort of a...
sort of a little diversion, as it were.

1065
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:08,010
And my wife always says, "What is life
without a little diversion?"

1066
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:14,410
Now, gentlemen, I give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy.

1067
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,790
Boo!

1068
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:20,720
From Germany,
the land of the Hun!

1069
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:48,850
Gentlemen, a little pearl
washed ashore...

1070
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,360
by the tide of war.

1071
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:04,240
Hey, talk
in a civilized language!

1072
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,470
It's true.
The little lady has her limitations.

1073
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,810
As a matter of fact,
she has absolutely no talent at all...

1074
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,820
except, that is,
maybe a little natural talent.

1075
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,730
The little lady can't dance,
she can't tell any jokes...

1076
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:25,990
and she can't balance rubber balls
on her little nose.

1077
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:30,930
But she can sing like a bird!
She has a throat of gold.

1078
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:35,030
- Come on, baby!
- Come on, honey! Sing us a song!

1079
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,210
Louder!

1080
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,430
- Sir.
- Yes, sir?

1081
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:13,430
We have orders
to move back to the front immediately.

1082
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,760
- Give the men a few minutes more.
- Yes, sir.

1083
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
