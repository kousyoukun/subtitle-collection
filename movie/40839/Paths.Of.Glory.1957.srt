1
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,020
War began between Germany
and France on August 3rd 1914.

2
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,540
Five weeks later
the German army had smashed its way

3
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,780
to within 18 miles of Paris.

4
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,900
There, the battered French rallied
their forces at the Marne river

5
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,060
and, in a series of unexpected
counterattacks, drove the Germans back.

6
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,780
The front was stabilised,
then shortly afterwards

7
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,260
developed into a continuous
line of heavily fortified trenches,

8
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,260
zigzagging their way 500 miles from
the English Channel to the Swiss frontier.

9
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,060
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare,

10
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,060
the battle lines had changed very little.

11
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,420
Successful attacks were
measured in hundreds of yards,

12
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,500
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

13
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,580
General Broulard, sir.

14
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,140
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Paul. Wonderful seeing you again.

15
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Well, this is splendid.

16
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,580
Superb!

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,380
I try to create a pleasant atmosphere
in which to work.

18
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,580
You've succeeded marvellously. I wish
I had your taste in carpets and pictures.

19
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,860
You're much too kind, George.
Sit down, George.

20
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,980
I haven't done very much. The place is
much the same as it was when I moved in.

21
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,540
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

22
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,500
It's top-secret. It must go no further
than your Chief of Staff, and not to him,

23
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,380
- unless you can trust his discretion.
- Of course.

24
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,580
A group of armies is forming
on this front for an offensive.

25
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,180
Headquarters is determined to make
a breakthrough. You're smiling.

26
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,700
I'm sorry. I thought for a moment I knew
what you were going to say. Please go on.

27
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,580
I never knew you were a mind-reader.
What did you think I was about to say?

28
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,500
- Something about the Ant Hill.
- You are a mind-reader.

29
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,780
Well, it is a key position. It's in my sector.

30
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,220
To be honest, I've heard some talk.
Nothing is secret around headquarters.

31
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,020
- Well, what do you think?
- It's the key to the German position here.

32
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,420
They've held onto it for a year and it looks
as if they'll hold onto it for another year.

33
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,500
I have orders to take the Ant Hill no later
than the 10th, the day after tomorrow.

34
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,660
That comes close to being ridiculous.

35
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,460
I wouldn't be here if I really thought that.

36
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,220
Paul, if there's one man in this army
who can do this for me, it's you.

37
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,460
It's out of the question.
Absolutely out of the question.

38
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,420
My division was cut to pieces.

39
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,060
What's left is in no position
to hold the Ant Hill, let alone take it.

40
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,140
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,300
Well, Paul, there was something else
I wanted to tell you.

42
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,100
But you may misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

43
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,500
What was it?

44
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,740
You'd be bound to misunderstand.

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,180
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

46
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,860
- What are you trying to say, George?
- Paul...

47
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,380
the talk is that you are being
considered for the 12th Corps.

48
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,340
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,180
I've pushed it all I can. They need a
fighting general and you're overdue a star.

50
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,380
Your record is good enough
for you to refuse this assignment

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,220
on the grounds you've stated.

52
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,420
No one would question your opinion.
They'd get someone else to do the job.

53
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,060
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion, Paul.

54
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,900
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks. Not before dinner.

55
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,500
George, I'm responsible
for the lives of 8,000 men.

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,340
What is my ambition against that?

57
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,580
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

58
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,860
My men come first of all, George,

59
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,500
- and those men know it, too.
- I know that they do.

60
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,180
- They know I would never let them down.
- That goes without saying.

61
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,580
The life of one soldier means more to me
than all the stars and honours in France.

62
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,900
So...

63
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,700
you think this attack is beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

64
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,020
I didn't say that, George.

65
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,620
Nothing is beyond those men
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

66
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,060
I won't push you
if you think it's ill-advised.

67
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,620
Don't worry, George.
You couldn't do that if you tried.

68
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,900
Of course, artillery would
make an enormous difference.

69
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,020
- What artillery support can you give me?
- I'll see.

70
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,100
- What about replacements?
- We'll see,

71
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,380
but I feel sure you can get along
with what you have.

72
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,700
- We might just do it.
- I knew that I was right to come to you.

73
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,740
You are the man to take the Ant Hill.
Now, as for that star...

74
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,860
That had nothing to do with my decision.

75
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,620
- If anything, it'd sway me the other way.
- I realise that perfectly.

76
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,780
- Now, when do you see this coming off?
- No later than the day after tomorrow.

77
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,380
We just might do it.

78
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,340
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

79
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,540
- What's your name, soldier?
- Sir, Private Ferol, Company A.

80
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,260
- Are you married?
- No, sir.

81
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,660
Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.

82
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,620
Well, carry on, Private.
And good luck to you.

83
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,700
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

84
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,580
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

85
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,940
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,180
Working over your rifle, I see.
That's the way. It's a soldier's best friend.

87
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,180
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

88
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,780
Well, good luck to you, soldier. Carry on.

89
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,980
Hello there, soldier.

90
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,020
Ready to kill more Germans?

91
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,180
Is everything all right, soldier?

92
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,020
- All right? Yes, sir. I'm all right.
- Ah-ha. Good fella.

93
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,060
- Are you married, soldier?
- Married? Me married?

94
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,700
Yes. Have you got a wife?

95
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,580
- A wife? Have I got a wife?
- Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

96
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,300
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

97
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,220
Have you got a wife, soldier?

98
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,940
My wife? My wife.

99
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,220
Yes, I have a wife. I'm never going to
see her again. I'm going to be killed.

100
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,980
You're acting like a coward!

101
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,460
- I am a coward.
- Snap out of it, soldier!

102
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,500
Sergeant, arrange for the immediate
transfer of this baby out of my regiment!

103
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,100
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him!

104
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,260
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

105
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,340
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

106
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,420
General, I'm convinced that your tours

107
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,140
have an incalculable effect
upon the men's morale.

108
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,900
The fighting spirit
of the 701st derives from it.

109
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,780
No, Major, that spirit
was just born in them.

110
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,220
The general is coming, sir.

111
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,340
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
- I'm honoured, General.

112
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,980
Well, quite a neat little spot you have here.

113
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,700
I'll reserve comment on
the neatness, sir, but it is little.

114
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,300
- Pretty shy on seating accommodation.
- More than enough for me.

115
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,500
Never got the habit of sitting.
Like to be on my feet.

116
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,220
- Keep on the move.
- I can vouch for that, Colonel.

117
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,420
I can hardly get him behind a desk
long enough to sign an order.

118
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,500
That's the way I am, Dax.

119
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,420
I can't understand these armchair officers.

120
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,420
Fellas trying to fight a war from behind
a desk. Waving papers at the enemy!

121
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,540
Worrying whether a mouse is
going to run up their pants leg.

122
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,020
If I had the choice between mice and
Mausers, I'd take the mice every time.

123
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,060
You'll never make me believe that.
Seriously, though,

124
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,140
if a man's a ninny, let him put on
a dress and hide under the bed.

125
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,020
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then he's got to be one.

126
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,060
He's got to fight, and he can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

127
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,820
- That's my credo.
- I think I have to agree with you,

128
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,140
presenting your case so convincingly, sir.

129
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,580
- I imagine you'd like a look around.
- Yes, Colonel.

130
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,260
Here's something to see - the Ant Hill.

131
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,300
It's as good a view as you can get
without being there.

132
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,420
That won't be long now, will it?

133
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,300
Hm. Yeah.

134
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,940
Well, I've seen much more formidable
objectives. Much, much worse.

135
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,500
Not something we can grab and run
away with, but certainly pregnable.

136
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,220
- Sounds kind of odd, though.
- Why?

137
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,740
- Like something to do with giving birth.
- Oh, yes. Quite.

138
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,340
You're right on your toes this morning.
Even sharper than usual.

139
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,060
We mustn't forget the colonel was the
foremost criminal lawyer in all France.

140
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,060
Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

141
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,300
Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

142
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,220
We drew some artillery. 29 casualties, sir.

143
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,180
Yes, noticed it on the road in.
utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

144
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,660
All swarmed together like flies,
waiting for someone to swat them.

145
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,580
They never learn. They get in a tight spot
under heavy fire, gang up every time.

146
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,460
Herd instinct, I suppose.
A lower animal sort of thing.

147
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,300
A human sort of thing, it seems to me.
Don't you make a distinction, Major?

148
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,060
Yes, very regrettable, of course.
Very. Yes, indeed.

149
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,340
Major, would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes?

150
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,420
Yes, sir. Of course.

151
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,380
Colonel.

152
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,780
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

153
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,620
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Ant Hill.

154
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,380
Colonel, your regiment is going
to take the Ant Hill tomorrow.

155
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,900
- You know the condition of my men, sir.
- Men will have to be killed.

156
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,220
Possibly a lot of them.
They absorb bullets and shrapnel,

157
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,660
making it possible
for others to get through.

158
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,060
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

159
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,740
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

160
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,100
Say 5%killed by our own barrage.
That's a very generous allowance.

161
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,460
10%more in getting
through no-man's-land,

162
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
and 20%more getting through the wire.

163
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,500
That leaves 65%,
with the worst part of the job over.

164
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,380
Let's say another 25%
in actually taking the Ant Hill.

165
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,420
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

166
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,300
You're saying that more than
half my men will be killed.

167
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,980
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel,
but we will have the Ant Hill.

168
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,020
- But will we, sir?
- I'm depending on you, Colonel.

169
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,100
All France is depending on you.

170
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,580
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

171
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,020
I'm not a bull. I don't need a flag
waving to get me to charge.

172
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,940
I don't like comparing
our flag to a bullfighter's cape.

173
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,020
I meant no disrespect to our flag.

174
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,380
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,
but a patriot is an honest man.

175
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,260
Samuel Johnson had something else
to say about patriotism.

176
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,660
And what was that, may I ask?

177
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,460
- Nothing, really.
- What do you mean?

178
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,940
- Sir, nothing important.
- When I ask a question, it's important.

179
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,260
- Now who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

180
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,980
What did he have to say about patriotism?

181
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,220
That it was the last refuge of a scoundrel,
sir. I'm sorry, I meant nothing personal.

182
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,340
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

183
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,700
It's you who is exhausted, not your men.

184
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,260
And it's my fault. I've given you
one impossible task after another.

185
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,220
- You need rest.
- I haven't said...

186
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,660
You never would, so you aren't
going to have any say-so about it.

187
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,420
As from now, I'm ordering you
on indefinite furlough.

188
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,740
General, you can't do that to me.

189
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,940
Not to you, Dax. For you.

190
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,380
- For your good and the good of your men.
- The good of my men, sir?

191
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,140
If a commanding officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

192
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,180
I don't want to relieve you, but
I must have your enthusiastic support.

193
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,780
Not once have you said
that your men can take the Ant Hill.

194
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,540
We'll take the Ant Hill.

195
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,420
If any soldiers in the worid can take it,

196
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,700
we'll take the Ant Hill.

197
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,900
And when you do, your men will
be relieved and get a long rest.

198
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune
reporting, sir.

199
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,380
- You took your time.
- We prepared as quick as we could, sir.

200
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,060
- We had to alert the sentries.
- All right. You men at ease.

201
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,900
This is a reconnaissance patrol.
German wire,

202
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,620
machine-gun posts,
identification of bodies.

203
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,980
There will only be the three of us.
We're to avoid a fight if we can.

204
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,500
We go out to the left and we come
back through post six on the right.

205
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,780
- Is it all clear at post six?
- All the sentries have been warned.

206
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,140
Number six will send up flares
at 10-minute intervals.

207
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,860
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I know. The sergeant says it's too much.

208
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,660
- He says it will draw artillery.
- He's some strategist. What's his name?

209
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,580
I don't know, sir.

210
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,060
All right. You men wait outside.
I'll join you in a minute.

211
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,260
Would you mind telling us the password?

212
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,340
- Calais.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,060
- He's fortifying himself.
- It smelled like heaven.

214
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,060
I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

215
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,100
At least he could have
passed it around, the pig.

216
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,900
What's he got against you, anyway?

217
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,460
We went to school together
before the war.

218
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,260
He thinks I don't have enough
respect for him. He's right.

219
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,940
If you gentlemen are ready.

220
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,340
Colonel.

221
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,140
- Everything clear and understood?
- Yes, sir.

222
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,860
The lane through our wire's in front here.
Machine gun's pointing at the opening.

223
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,860
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.

224
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,900
All right, men. Let's go.

225
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,180
- What's that?
- I don't know.

226
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,340
Lejeune, move out and look
that over. We'll cover you.

227
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,700
Split up a night patrol?

228
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,980
Move out, Lejeune.

229
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,420
- I don't like this. Let's get outta here.
- We haven't given him enough time.

230
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,620
- If we wait any longer, they'll get us too.
- We've gotta wait for him.

231
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,540
He must be dead! Where is he?

232
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,540
- Well!
- Surprised, Lieutenant?

233
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,980
Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

234
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,220
- You didn't wait to find out, did you?
- Look here, what do you mean?

235
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,460
I mean you ran like a rabbit
after you killed Lejeune.

236
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,060
Killed Lejeune?
What are you talking about?

237
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,460
I don't think I like your tone.

238
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,340
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

239
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,020
Well, I must be mistaken, then, sir.

240
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,460
An officer wouldn't do that.

241
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,740
A man wouldn't do it. Only a thing would.

242
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,420
A sneaky, booze-guzzling,
yellow-bellied rat

243
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,980
with a bottle for a brain
and a streak of spit...

244
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,580
- That's enough, Corporal.
- You've got yourself into a mess.

245
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,540
I have, have I?
You've got yourself in a worse one.

246
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,300
First, general insubordination.
Second, threatening your superior officer.

247
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,460
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

248
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,060
How do you think those charges
will look on paper?

249
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Not half as bad as these:

250
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,580
endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness, drunk on duty,

251
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,020
wanton murder of one of your own men,

252
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,500
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

253
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,420
Phillip, have you ever tried to bring
charges against an officer?

254
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,060
It's my word against yours, you know.

255
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,580
Whose word do you think
they're gonna believe?

256
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,940
Let me put it another way. Whose word
do you think they're going to accept?

257
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,420
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

258
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,420
So far, all I have written in this report

259
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,860
is that you and Lejeune
were killed while out on patrol.

260
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,140
I'll make it read
that you made your way back

261
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,340
after getting separated in the skirmish.

262
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,980
- That'll end the matter...
- You killed Lejeune.

263
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,820
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

264
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,260
I'd give anything in the worid
if it hadn't had happened.

265
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,740
Honestly, I know you don't like me, but
what kind of a man do you think I am?

266
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,940
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

267
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,380
- I've been waiting for your report.
- We found out a thing or two.

268
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,100
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

269
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,220
- How did it happen?
- It's in the report.

270
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,180
- Let's have it.
- It isn't quite finished yet, sir.

271
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,860
That's all, Corporal. You did
a good night's work. Should feel proud.

272
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,700
- Go get some sleep.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,340
- How did you lose Lejeune?
- Machine-gun fire, sir.

274
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,980
He coughed. Almost got us all killed.

275
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,620
Finish that report
and get it to me immediately.

276
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,660
Yes, sir.

277
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,500
The artillery starts at 0515.

278
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,300
The 1st Battalion will move out at 0530.

279
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,980
When the leading elements have cleared
the German wires, the second wave -

280
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,500
the 2nd and 3rd Battalions minus
two companies in reserve - will move out,

281
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,020
in no case later than 0540.

282
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,180
That's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

283
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,380
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery
preparation all that we can expect?

284
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,980
The feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organised.

285
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,060
What's weather supposed
to be like tomorrow, sir?

286
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,660
- Too good.
- No chance of rain or fog?

287
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,300
The forecast is for sun all day.

288
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,580
lf... Perhaps I should say
when we take the Ant Hill,

289
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,140
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

290
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,660
General Mireau, who will be
personally observing the attack,

291
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,580
has promised support from
the 72nd by sundown tomorrow,

292
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,100
which means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

293
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,380
Are there any more questions?

294
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,660
Well, gentlemen, good luck. I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

295
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,420
Let's get some sleep.

296
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,180
I'm not afraid of dying,
only of getting killed.

297
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,340
- That's as clear as mud.
- Which would you rather be done in by?

298
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,940
- A bayonet or a machine gun?
- A machine gun.

299
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,460
That's just my point. They're both
pieces of steel ripping into you,

300
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,580
only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful.

301
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,580
- So?
- Most of us are more afraid

302
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,300
of getting hurt than of getting killed.

303
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,500
Look at Bernard. He panics when it comes
to gas. Gas doesn't bother me a bit.

304
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,980
He's seen photos of gas cases -
doesn't mean anything to me.

305
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,180
But I'll tell you something.
I'd hate to be without my tin hat.

306
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,940
But I don't mind
not having a tin hat for my tail.

307
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,620
Why? Because I know a wound in the
head would hurt more than one in the tail.

308
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,620
The tail is just meat.
But the head is all bone.

309
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,780
- Speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

310
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,340
Aside from the bayonet,
what do you fear most?

311
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,100
- High explosives.
- Exactly! It's the same with me,

312
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,900
because I know that it can chew
you up worse than anything else.

313
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,980
If you're afraid of dying,
you'd spend your life in a funk

314
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,220
because you know
you've got to go someday.

315
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,860
And if it's death you're afraid of, why
should you care about what kills you?

316
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,100
You're too smart for me, professor.
All I know is, nobody wants to die.

317
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,860
Through to Division, sir.
Through to Polygon.

318
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,220
Everything quiet.
All units report themselves ready.

319
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,300
Zero minus two.

320
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,900
- May I offer you some cognac?
- Thank you, sir.

321
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,860
After you, sir.

322
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,820
To France.

323
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,900
Minus 15... 14... 13...

324
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,980
10, 9, 8, 7,

325
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,860
6, 5, 4, 3,

326
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,500
2, 1... zero!

327
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,300
- Sergeant, where's B Company?
- I don't know, sir.

328
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,100
- Where on earth are they?
- On the left...

329
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,540
Where are the rest?! Zero plus one,
and they're still in the trenches.

330
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,940
Miserable cowards.
They're not advancing!

331
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,340
The barrage is getting away from them!
They're still in the trenches!

332
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,780
- Captain Nichols.
- Yes, sir?

333
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,860
Order the 75s to commence
firing on our own positions.

334
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,140
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

335
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,460
No, sir, but... I respectfully ask to...

336
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,660
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

337
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,700
No, sir.

338
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,660
- Then carry it out, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,340
Hello, Polygon? This is Division.

340
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,020
Batteries 1 and 2 commence firing...

341
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,860
on coordinates 32-58-78.

342
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:46,340
Batteries 1 and 2 to commence
firing on coordinates 32-58-78. Over.

343
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,660
The battery commander reports
those are our own positions.

344
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,660
- He says it must be a mistake.
- Confirm the order, Captain.

345
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,060
The order is confirmed.

346
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,860
Battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order

347
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,460
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general. Over.

348
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,620
Battery commander cannot execute
such an order unless it is in writing,

349
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,940
- and signed by the general.
- Give me that phone!

350
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,300
- General Mireau speaking!
- Battery commander speaking.

351
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,660
The troops are mutinying,
refusing to advance. Fire as ordered!

352
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,340
With all respect, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men

353
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,780
unless you are willing
to take full responsibility for it.

354
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,260
Captain Rousseau,
will you obey my order?

355
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,940
I must have a written order before
I can execute such a command, sir.

356
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,140
Supposing you're killed. Where will I be?

357
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,540
In front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning, that's where!

358
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,900
Hand over your command and report
yourself under arrest to my headquarters.

359
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,260
Roget! Lieutenant Roget,
why are your men still in here?

360
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,460
- It's impossible, sir. Major Vignon is dead.
- Get these men out of the trenches!

361
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,460
Come on! Let's get ready for another try.

362
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,100
- Get these men outta here!
- I tried three times.

363
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,740
All right! Let's give it another try!

364
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,580
Come on! Let's give it another try!

365
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,140
It's impossible, sir.
All the men are falling back.

366
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,700
Sir, I respectfully submit to the colonel...

367
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,940
Pardon me. Your remarks to me
were very unfair, sir.

368
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,620
It's just impossible.
It's just impossible.

369
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,140
According to reports,
the attack has failed all along the line.

370
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,820
The men are falling back
to our own trenches.

371
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,420
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for the
immediate relief of the 701st Regiment.

372
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,300
Have them sent to the Château de I'Aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to me.

373
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,300
Major Couderc, assemble
a general court martial.

374
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,820
Have it meet at 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.

375
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,620
If those sweethearts won't face
German bullets, they'll face French ones!

376
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,860
I ordered an attack.
Your troops refused to attack.

377
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,340
They attacked,
but they could make no headway.

378
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,780
Because they didn't try. I saw it myself.
Half of your men never left the trenches.

379
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,580
A third of my men were
pinned down by the intense fire.

380
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,340
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

381
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,860
A good part of your men
never left their own trenches.

382
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,580
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men
from each company in your regiment

383
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,460
tried under penalty of death
for cowardice.

384
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,820
- Penalty of death...?
- For cowardice!

385
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,380
- They have skimmed milk for blood.
- It's the reddest milk I've ever seen.

386
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,940
- That's enough...
- I'm not gonna mince words...

387
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,460
Colonel Dax, if you continue in
this manner, you shall be arrested.

388
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,020
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it bluntly.

389
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,860
This is not a trial,
but it does bear aspects of one.

390
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,180
Colonel Dax technically is cast in the role
of the defence. With such grave charges,

391
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,420
a court of law would grant him
latitude in presenting his case.

392
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,740
Latitude is one thing,
insubordination another.

393
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,340
I am merely offering an opinion. Please
do not feel constrained to accept it.

394
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

395
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,220
I'm sorry, sir. I certainly
didn't intend to be insubordinate.

396
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,380
My only aim is
to remind you of the heroism

397
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,180
these men have shown
on every occasion in the past.

398
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,100
We're talking about the present.

399
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,300
Sir, they're not cowards.
If some didn't leave the trenches,

400
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,660
it must have been
because it was impossible.

401
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,980
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

402
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,660
We can't leave it up to the men to decide
when an order is possible or not.

403
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,300
If it was impossible, the only proof would
be their dead bodies lying in the trenches.

404
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,820
They're scum, Colonel.
The whole rotten regiment.

405
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,020
A pack of sneaking,
whining, tail-dragging curs.

406
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,340
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

407
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,460
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

408
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,780
Then why not shoot the entire regiment?

409
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,140
- I'm serious.
- Now, Colonel, you're missing the point.

410
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,820
We don't want to slaughter the French
army. We want to set an example.

411
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,540
- If it's an example you want, take me.
- Take you?

412
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,100
Yes, sir. If it's an example you want,
one man will do as well as 100.

413
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,420
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

414
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,140
Now, Colonel, I think you're overwrought.
This is not a question of officers.

415
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,300
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

416
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,980
Suppose we just make it a dozen?

417
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,900
I was talking of 100 men.
Now we're down to 12.

418
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,260
Let's not haggle over this thing any more.

419
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,580
Let's get it settled once and for all
so that we can all live with it.

420
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,020
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see proper justice meted out.

421
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,100
I've spent my entire life in the army.

422
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,500
I've always tried
to be true to my principles.

423
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,580
That's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

424
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,660
I'll settle for this: have the company
commanders select one man

425
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,700
from each company
in the first wave - three in all.

426
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,900
That's very reasonable of you, Paul.

427
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,500
The court martial will meet
at the château at three o'clock.

428
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,660
- Will that be convenient for you?
- I won't be there, Paul.

429
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,140
- You won't be there?
- I think it best that you handle this matter.

430
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,220
Probably so.

431
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,580
General Mireau, if possible, I'd like to
be appointed counsellor for the accused.

432
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,380
- I'll take the matter under consideration.
- We can permit that, Paul.

433
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,220
- Consider it settled, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

434
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,860
Noon straight up. I hope
you can stay for lunch, Colonel.

435
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,660
George, I'm afraid
the colonel won't have time.

436
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,540
Don't deny it, Paul.
You've been hiding this man.

437
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,020
Keeping him for your own.
That was very selfish!

438
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,900
Thank you for your courtesy,
but it isn't long until three o'clock.

439
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,740
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

440
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,020
Yes, Captain?

441
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,140
They ordered me to report
to you here. Captain Rousseau.

442
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,700
Yes, of course.

443
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,420
I wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short.

444
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
I haven't time to go into it now.

445
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,780
Report back to your command
until further orders.

446
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,340
- Bad stuff. Demoralises the men.
- I quite agree with you.

447
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,820
- We should shelve him to another outfit.
- A court of inquiry should roast him first.

448
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,420
In cases like this, shells falling short,
I always try to avoid an inquiry.

449
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,860
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

450
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,940
- Shelving would be the best discipline.
- Perhaps you're right.

451
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,900
Would you excuse me?
I want to speak to the colonel.

452
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,940
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

453
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,180
That's Captain Sancy,
Captain Renoir and Lieutenant Roget

454
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,980
to meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour.

455
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,620
- Colonel Dax!
- Yes, General?

456
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,380
- I'd like a word with you.
- Certainly, sir.

457
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,940
Best be sensible about this.

458
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,380
Sensible, sir?

459
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,780
Listen to me, Dax. Give up
this fancy talk with me, you understand?

460
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,540
Colonel Broulard seems
to think you're funny. I don't.

461
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,580
- I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon, sir, is that an order?

462
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,340
Colonel Dax, when this mess
is cleaned up, I'll break you.

463
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,580
I'll find an excuse and break you
to the ranks. I'll ruin you!

464
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,660
It'll be just what you deserve, showing so
little loyalty to your commanding officer.

465
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,940
That's all, Colonel.

466
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,260
General Mireau feels that
the attack on the Ant Hill

467
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,100
failed because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the 1st Battalion.

468
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,180
Each of you is to select one man from
your company, place him under arrest,

469
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,660
and have him ready to appear before
a court martial at 1500 hours today.

470
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,100
The charge is cowardice
before the enemy.

471
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,060
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

472
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,820
Roget killed Lejeune on that patrol,
then blackmailed me into keeping quiet!

473
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,180
That's why he picked me.

474
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,980
I understand your feelings, but that
has nothing to do with these charges.

475
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,780
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do.

476
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,340
But who else will?
You've got no witnesses.

477
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,220
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonise the court.

478
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,620
When this is over, I'm going
into the story of that patrol again.

479
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,420
Sir, in my case, Captain Renoir
had the sergeant draw lots.

480
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,740
I was picked purely by chance.

481
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,940
You're lucky. Look at me.

482
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,260
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

483
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,620
Me, a social undesirable.

484
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,100
- I didn't act like a coward!
- Neither did I!

485
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,180
Gentlemen, you must understand that
the reason you were picked is immaterial.

486
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,540
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

487
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,300
Stick to the stories you've told me. Don't
let the prosecutor shake you out of it.

488
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,620
You'll be soldiers in
the presence of superior officers,

489
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,500
so act like what you are - soldiers.

490
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,780
And brave ones at that.

491
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,180
I've been in the room you'll be in.
The sun will be in your faces,

492
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,500
so don't let it seem as if you're dropping
your eyes in a hangdog manner.

493
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,780
When you speak,
look the judges in the eye.

494
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,820
Don't whine, plead or
make speeches - that's my job.

495
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,780
Simple statements - short, but make them
so they can be heard all over the room.

496
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,660
Try not to repeat yourselves.
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

497
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,740
We haven't much time. The court martial
is in an hour and I've got notes to look at.

498
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,820
Good luck.

499
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,260
Thank you, sir.

500
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,700
The court martial is open.
The prisoners may be seated.

501
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,500
This is a general court martial, so we shall
dispense with unnecessary formalities.

502
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,020
These men are charged with
cowardice in the face of the enemy,

503
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,940
and will be tried for that offence.

504
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,900
- Mr Prosecutor?
- Call the accused. Private Ferol.

505
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,700
Mr President, will the prosecutor
question the witnesses

506
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,740
without even reading the indictment?

507
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,180
Please don't take up
the court's time with technicalities.

508
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,900
The indictment is lengthy,
and there's no point in reading it.

509
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,860
- The defence has a right to know...
- It states the accused showed cowardice

510
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,220
in the face of the enemy
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

511
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,140
Proceed, Mr Prosecutor.

512
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,500
Call the accused, Private Ferol.

513
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,420
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir.

514
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,100
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Ant Hill?

515
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,340
Yes, sir.

516
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,340
- Did you refuse to advance?
- No, sir.

517
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,500
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

518
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,620
- How far did you advance?
- To the middle of no-man's-land, sir.

519
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,460
Then what did you do?

520
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,860
- There were machine-gun bullets...
- Answer the question. What did you do?

521
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,100
Well... I saw that me and Meyer...

522
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,180
I didn't ask you what you saw.

523
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,100
The court has no concern
with your visual experiences.

524
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,220
My what, sir?

525
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,060
- The prisoner will reply to the question.
- Yes, sir. What question was it?

526
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,860
You advanced to the middle of
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

527
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,580
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

528
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,260
I went back, sir.

529
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,620
In other words, Private Ferol,

530
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,100
you retreated.

531
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,140
Yes, sir.

532
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,220
That's all.
The accused may return to his seat.

533
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,300
Just a minute.

534
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,980
Mr President, I'd like
to question the witness, if I may.

535
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,740
- Proceed, Colonel.
- Thank you.

536
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,260
Private, when you reached no-man's-land,
were you alone with Private Meyer?

537
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,500
Yes, sir.

538
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,980
What happened to
the rest of your company?

539
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,100
I don't know, sir.

540
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,220
I guess they had been killed or wounded.

541
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,660
You found yourself in the middle of
no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

542
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,940
Why didn't you attack
the Ant Hill single-handed?

543
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,220
Why didn't you storm the Ant Hill alone?

544
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,220
Just me and Meyer? You're kidding, sir.

545
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,700
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.
Thank you.

546
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,860
- That's all.
- Why do you use this line of questioning?

547
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,060
I'm attempting to indicate
the utter absurdity

548
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,260
of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

549
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,060
Mr Prosecutor.

550
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,300
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated.

551
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,060
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

552
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,300
I knew we should have took Ant Hill,

553
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,580
but we came on back.

554
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,300
That's all.

555
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,700
The accused may return to his seat.

556
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,940
Private Arnaud.

557
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,220
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

558
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,940
until I was ordered back
to the trenches by Captain Renoir.

559
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,900
- How far did you advance?
- Into the wire, sir.

560
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,620
The... enemy wire, I suppose?

561
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,700
No, sir. It was our wire.

562
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,100
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

563
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,020
No, sir, I didn't.

564
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,660
How far would you say that was?
How many metres?

565
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,260
I advanced as far as I could.

566
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,580
- How many metres?
- Not many.

567
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,540
Not many.

568
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,740
Now, Private Arnaud.

569
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:29,900
Before you were ordered back, did you
urge your fellow soldiers forward?

570
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,260
Most of them were dead or wounded
before they'd taken three steps.

571
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,180
- Reply to the question.
- I didn't urge them on, no, sir.

572
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,700
Thank you.

573
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,540
Private Arnaud.

574
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,620
At ease, please.

575
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,700
Aside from your sad failure
to give throat to spirited battle cries,

576
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,100
did your behaviour differ from
that of other men in your company?

577
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,580
Objection.
That's a matter of conjecture.

578
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,820
Sustained.

579
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,420
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

580
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,860
No, sir.

581
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,100
Have you been designated a coward

582
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,940
simply because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

583
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,820
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see that that's significant.

584
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,380
It's accepted practice in the French army
to pick examples by lot.

585
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,940
This entire company
advanced only a few metres,

586
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,860
so picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case.

587
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:36,180
This soldier has distinguished himself in
some of the bloodiest battles of the war.

588
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,060
With your permission,
I'll read citations for bravery

589
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,300
that he's already earned
on two occasions.

590
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,020
- First, citations in the orders in the army...
- That's immaterial, Colonel.

591
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,340
The accused is not being tried for former
bravery, but for his recent cowardice.

592
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,380
Medals are no defence.

593
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,140
- May I call witnesses to his character?
- You may not.

594
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,180
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

595
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,060
Mr President, no one
in the entire regiment

596
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,300
got anywhere near the German wire,
including myself.

597
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,060
Call the next accused...

598
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,300
if you're through, Colonel.

599
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,700
Thank you.

600
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,060
The prisoner may return to his seat.

601
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,220
So you never even left the trenches?

602
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,860
- No, sir.
- That's all.

603
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,860
Corporal Paris, why didn't
you leave the trenches?

604
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,020
Major Vignon was shot and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

605
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,380
Were you lying unconscious in
the trenches during the entire attack?

606
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,460
Yes, sir.

607
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,900
That's all.

608
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,580
Have you any witnesses to that?

609
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,620
No, sir. I guess everybody
was too busy to notice me,

610
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,660
and so many others were lying dead.

611
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,660
- But you have no witnesses?
- No, sir.

612
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,420
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

613
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,140
That could have been self-inflicted later.

614
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,620
Thank you. You may stand down.

615
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,700
Mr Prosecutor,
you can make your plea now.

616
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,740
Gentlemen of the court,

617
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,580
this case speaks for itself.

618
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,660
All of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

619
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,660
And I submit that that attack

620
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,500
was a stain on the flag of France,

621
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,700
a blot on the honour of every man,
woman and child in the French nation.

622
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:03,260
It is to us that the sad,
distressing, repellent duty falls.

623
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,580
Gentlemen, I ask this court

624
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,220
to find the accused guilty,

625
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,940
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the code of military justice.

626
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,980
Thank you, Mr Prosecutor.

627
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,620
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

628
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,300
Gentlemen, there are times when I'm
ashamed to belong to the human race,

629
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,380
and this is one such occasion.

630
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,180
It's impossible for me to summarise
the case for the defence,

631
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,980
since the court never allowed me
an opportunity to present my case.

632
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,540
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

633
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,220
Yes, sir. I protest against being
prevented from introducing evidence

634
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,060
that I consider vital to the defence.

635
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,980
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

636
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,540
There has never been a written indictment
of charges made against the defendants.

637
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,300
And lastly, I protest against the fact

638
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,020
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

639
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,780
The attack yesterday morning
is no stain on the honour of France,

640
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,940
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

641
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,860
But this court martial
is such a stain, and such a disgrace.

642
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,900
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

643
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,260
Gentlemen of the court,
to find these men guilty

644
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:56,460
will be a crime to haunt each of you
till the day you die.

645
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,260
I can't believe that
the noblest impulse of man,

646
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,940
his compassion for another,
can be completely dead here.

647
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,780
Therefore, I humbly beg you,

648
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,780
show mercy to these men.

649
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,740
The accused will be escorted back to
the guardroom. The hearing is closed.

650
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,260
The court will now retire to deliberate.

651
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,460
There will be a guard of six men
under arms. Two men to each prisoner.

652
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,180
Any sign of trouble,
the prisoners will be covered.

653
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,740
If the trouble doesn't subside at once,
the prisoner will be shot.

654
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,260
It must all go off without a hitch
and with the least possible delay.

655
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,860
It shouldn't be hurried,
but there must be no fumbling around.

656
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,900
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible

657
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,900
for any lack of order, or for any mistakes.

658
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,900
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame, and with interest,

659
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,420
to any one of you who fails in his duties.

660
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,260
Execution will take place at seven o'clock,

661
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,260
according to the verdict
of the court martial.

662
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,420
Detail, attention! Dismissed!

663
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,820
This is compliments of General Mireau.

664
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,980
- Duck.
- Well, tell him thanks

665
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,700
Don't blame me, soldier.

666
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,980
Are we supposed to eat
this with our fingers?

667
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,740
The guard says you can't
have any knives or forks.

668
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,900
Is this supposed to be our last meal?

669
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,380
It isn't supposedto be our last meal.
It is our last meal.

670
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,860
This duck is terrific.

671
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,300
Do you suppose they put
anything in the food?

672
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,860
First they poison us, then they shoot us?

673
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,220
- I think they put something in it.
- Like what?

674
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:03,260
Like, uh... something
to make us groggy or something.

675
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,380
What would be wrong
with that if they did?

676
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,260
Maybe nothing for you, but I'm gonna get
out of this, and I don't wanna be drugged.

677
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,740
How are you gonna get out?
Chew your way through that stone wall?

678
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,980
Colonel Dax. He'll see us through.

679
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:22,580
We gotta get outta here.
They're gonna kill us in a few hours.

680
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,900
- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's gotta be a way.

681
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,340
How many guards
do you think they've got?

682
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,500
They may have a couple of squads.
That's what it sounded like.

683
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,780
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the 3rd Battalion.

684
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,980
Anyway, right now we have no friends.

685
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,940
Why kid yourself?
We're not gonna get out of this.

686
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,940
Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

687
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,020
See that cockroach?

688
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,060
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

689
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,060
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

690
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,900
I'll be nothing and it'll be alive.

691
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,980
Now you've got the edge on him.

692
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,660
Good evening, my sons. I'm Father Dupré.

693
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,660
Is there any news?

694
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,860
I'm afraid I bring you very bad news. You
must prepare yourselves for the worst.

695
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,580
- Colonel Dax asked me to tell you.
- Oh, mercy, no!

696
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,500
He's been in telephone contact
with army headquarters,

697
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,220
but unable to speak to General Broulard
or to anyone in authority.

698
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,420
The same way at Division.
No one wants to be found.

699
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,780
- How much time do we have?
- You have plenty.

700
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,980
Certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves.

701
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,260
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

702
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,300
Amen.

703
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,020
- Father, will you take this letter for me?
- Of course, my son.

704
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,820
It's to my wife. She won't understand
this, and I tried to explain it to her.

705
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,580
I'll see that she gets it.
Do you want me to hear your confession?

706
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,820
Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

707
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,380
I know you're trying to help
and I appreciate it,

708
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,380
but if I started praying now
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

709
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,820
That's an error, my son. God is
always ready to listen to your prayers.

710
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,140
All right, Father.
Will you please hear my confession now?

711
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,420
Yes.

712
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:31,100
Have faith in your Creator, my son.
Death comes to us all.

713
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,540
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

714
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,420
That's really deep. "Death
comes to us all". That really is deep.

715
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,660
Ferol, what's the matter?
Afraid your luck won't hold out?

716
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,540
This is my religion.
O great bottle, forgive me my sins,

717
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,100
for now I lay me down to sleep.
May I drink you first? Thank you. Amen.

718
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:53,300
I understand your anguish, my son,
but you must not let it harden your heart.

719
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,460
May I tell you something, Father?

720
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,900
Back in my home town, there was a café
with an amusing sign over the bar.

721
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:05,340
It read "Do not be afraid to ask for credit
for our way of refusing is very polite."

722
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,140
- Come on, Arnaud. You're drunk.
- Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

723
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,100
Get out of here with
your sanctimonious pat answers!

724
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,380
- Are you here to torture us?!
- No, to help you with all my power.

725
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,420
You have no power!

726
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,940
- God has power.
- Does he? What a laugh!

727
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,660
- You can be saved.
- Saved? I'll be saved?

728
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,820
Cut it out, Arnaud!

729
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,780
Arnaud!

730
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,780
Arnaud.

731
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,820
Father, get a doctor. Quick.

732
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,260
That should keep him quiet long enough.

733
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,180
That's a nasty skull fracture.
He may not last the night.

734
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,580
- What are we supposed to do with him?
- You can tie him to a stretcher

735
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,660
so you can tilt him vertically.

736
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,580
Surely they won't execute
a man in that condition?

737
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,940
I'm sorry, Father. The sentence will be
carried out. I checked with the general.

738
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,980
If he's alive in the morning,
pinch his cheeks before you take him out.

739
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,700
It may open his eyes.
The general wants him conscious.

740
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,740
Yes?

741
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,420
- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in.

742
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,060
Sergeant Boulanger
said you wanted to see me, sir.

743
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,860
Yes, Lieutenant. Looks as if we have
a pretty unpleasant thing on our hands.

744
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,900
- You mean the execution, sir.
- Yes, I mean the execution.

745
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,340
- Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.
- "Very unfortunate."

746
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,380
- That's just how I feel about it.
- None of us are happy about it, sir.

747
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,300
How did you happen
to pick Corporal Paris?

748
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,620
Well, I had to pick somebody, sir.

749
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,540
Yes, you did. You had no personal
motive in picking Paris, did you?

750
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,380
Oh, no, sir.

751
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,540
You picked him because
he was a coward, didn't you?

752
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,140
Did you or didn't you?

753
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,220
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

754
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:07,180
- Like you say, someone had to be picked.
- It was quite a problem, sir.

755
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,820
I have a similar problem.
I have to pick someone

756
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,860
to be in charge of the firing squad.

757
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,980
Do you have any objections
to taking the job?

758
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,660
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

759
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,980
What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

760
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,900
No... Yeah, I feel all right, sir.
It's just that I...

761
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,620
- Would you like me to open a window?
- No, sir.

762
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:33,700
Well, it's... just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

763
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:39,140
Oh, there's nothing to it. First, you help
the sergeant tie the men to the posts.

764
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:44,020
Of course, you offer the men blindfolds
and... if they want them, you tie them on.

765
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:49,420
You take your position with the firing
squad, raise your sword - ready, aim, fire.

766
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,180
Then you draw your revolver out,
you walk forward,

767
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,620
and put a bullet through each man's head.

768
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,060
Sir, I request that I be
excused from this duty.

769
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,660
- Request denied.
- Colonel...

770
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:06,140
You've got the job. It's all yours.
That's all, Lieutenant.

771
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,220
- Colonel, if you could...
- That's all!

772
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,700
Yes?

773
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,940
- Ex cuse me, sir. Colonel Dax?
- Yes?

774
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,460
My name is Rousseau, sir.
Captain of artillery.

775
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,740
What is it, Captain?

776
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,420
I have something to tell you, sir, that may
have a great bearing on the court martial.

777
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,940
Come in, Captain.

778
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,940
- Colonel, good evening!
- Good evening, sir.

779
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,060
- Good evening. Come and sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

780
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,900
- I'm sorry to intrude on you in this way.
- I'm always delighted to see you.

781
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,620
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.

782
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,060
- Well, I...
- I think you'll find it delicious.

783
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,620
I apologise for not
inviting you to the party,

784
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,900
but I'm afraid that it's a dress affair.

785
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:49,060
Thank you, sir, but I must confess
that this is not entirely a social visit.

786
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,900
Oh, come, Dax, let's not go
over all that ground again.

787
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:59,900
But judging by the casualties, the efforts
of your regiment must have been notable.

788
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,620
How can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot?

789
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,140
You're taking a rather simple view of this.

790
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:11,420
The attack was impossible. The
general staff must have known that.

791
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,500
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing
a good job running the war.

792
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,140
You must be aware that
the general staff is subject

793
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,580
to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians.

794
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,420
Maybe the attack against
the Ant Hill was impossible.

795
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,660
Perhaps we made an error of judgment.
On the other hand,

796
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,820
if your men had been a little more daring,
they might have taken it. Who knows?

797
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:36,740
Why should we have to bear any more
criticism for the failure than we have to?

798
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,340
Aside from the fact that many
of your men never left the trenches,

799
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,740
there's the question of the troops' morale.

800
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,540
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

801
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,460
These executions will be
a tonic for the division.

802
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,820
Few things are more encouraging and
stimulating than seeing someone else die.

803
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,820
- I never thought of that, sir.
- Troops are like children.

804
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:59,300
Just as a child wants his father to be firm,
troops crave discipline.

805
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,940
One way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

806
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:08,460
May I ask... do you sincerely believe
all the things you've just said?

807
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:18,460
It's been a pleasure discussing this with
you, but I'd better get back to my guests.

808
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,540
Forgive me for having
kept you from your party.

809
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:26,740
By the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau

810
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,980
ordered his own battery
commander, Captain Rousseau,

811
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:33,300
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

812
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,660
Of course, the captain refused
without a written order.

813
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:43,820
But General Mireau demanded that
he commence firing on our own trenches.

814
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,260
Rousseau refused
without an order in writing,

815
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:52,260
but again he was ordered, and again
he refused... all in front of witnesses.

816
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,980
Do you actually believe
this fantastic story?

817
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,900
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

818
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:02,580
Battery Commander Rousseau,
Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter,

819
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,340
the telephone clerk, and, uh...
my own deposition.

820
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,380
What has all this got to do with
the charge against the prisoners?

821
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,860
A general in a tantrum
over the failure of an impossible attack

822
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:16,660
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

823
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,180
Now, the same officer on the same day

824
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:25,220
orders a court martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

825
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,860
General, what would your newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

826
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,420
Colonel Dax,
are you trying to blackmail me?

827
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,420
Sir, that's an ugly word,
but you are in a difficult position.

828
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:42,060
Too much has happened. Someone's
got to be hurt. The only question is who.

829
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,500
General Mireau's assault
on the Ant Hill failed.

830
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,420
His order to fire on
his own troops was refused,

831
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,460
but his attempt to murder three innocent
men to protect his own reputation

832
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,940
will be prevented by the general staff.

833
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:07,940
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax?
I've been rude to my guests too long.

834
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,860
Detail, halt!

835
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,180
Order arms!

836
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,700
Fall out.

837
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,180
Courage, my sons. The worst is over.

838
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:22,300
Morning, Paris.

839
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,540
Morning, Sergeant.

840
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,060
- How are you today?
- Not too bad.

841
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,100
How are you?

842
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,980
You missed some good chow
in here last night.

843
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,260
What'd you have?

844
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,220
Have you got a drink for us?

845
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,660
Take a swig of this.

846
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,220
It just occurred to me... a funny thing.

847
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:55,140
I haven't had one sexual thought since the
court martial. It's extraordinary, isn't it?

848
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,660
Pull yourself together. Act like a man.

849
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:04,660
Paris, are you listening to me? There'll be
dignitaries and newspaper men out there.

850
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:07,580
You've got family.
How do you wanna be remembered?

851
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,060
I don't wanna die.

852
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,540
Many of us'll join you
before this war's over.

853
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,060
I don't care. I don't wanna die.

854
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,140
- Please save me, Sergeant.
- I can't save you. No one can now.

855
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,580
This is the last decision
you can make on earth.

856
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,700
You can act like a man,
or we'll have to drag you out of here.

857
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,740
In the end, it'll all be the same.
It's up to you.

858
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:50,380
Let's get busy. You and Ferol, take your
coats off. It's no use hanging around here.

859
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,260
With the help of thy grace, to do penance,

860
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,300
and to amend my life.

861
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,180
Why do I have to die, Father?

862
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,060
Why do I have to die, Father?
I didn't do anything.

863
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,060
We do not question
the will of God, my son.

864
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:35,260
But I fought, I fought!
I fought on the battlefield.

865
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,740
Why don't they die?
Why don't you put them to death?

866
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,980
You showed courage in the face of the
enemy. Show it before your own troops.

867
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,380
But I'm scared, I'm scared.

868
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,540
Oh, Father, I'm scared.

869
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,980
Courage. Brace yourself, man.

870
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:04,140
He said "This day thou shalt
be with me in paradise."

871
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,420
- Really, Father?
- Yes.

872
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,820
Really, Father?

873
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,980
I'll never see my wife again.

874
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,540
I'll never see nobody again, Father.

875
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,060
Courage, man. Brace yourself.

876
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,740
- I can't help it!
- Brace yourself.

877
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,420
I can't help it, Father.

878
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,220
Oh, Christ, Christ.

879
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,020
Strengthen me, God.
Please strengthen me.

880
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,980
Secure prisoners!

881
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:05,460
Detail, attention!

882
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,540
Forward... march!

883
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,260
Detail...

884
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,100
halt!

885
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,180
Left... face!

886
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,100
In the name of the French people,

887
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:04,620
Corporal Phillip Paris, Private Maurice
Ferol, and Private Pierre Arnaud

888
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:07,100
of the 701st Regiment,

889
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,980
having been found guilty of cowardice
in the face of the enemy,

890
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,300
are to be executed
by rifle fire immediately,

891
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:19,220
in accordance with the judgment
of the military court martial.

892
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,660
Right face!

893
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,980
Forward march!

894
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,300
Do you want a blindfold?

895
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,300
Yes, Lieutenant, please.

896
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,140
I don't wanna die.

897
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,140
Do... do you want a blindfold?

898
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,660
No.

899
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,660
I'm sorry.

900
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,020
Ready!

901
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,460
Aim!

902
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,540
Fire!

903
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,820
I'm awfully glad you could be there,
George.

904
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:16,700
This sort of thing is always rather grim,
but this one had a kind of splendour to it.

905
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,860
I have never seen an affair
of this sort handled any better.

906
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,900
The men died wonderfully.

907
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:25,260
One of them could have done something
that would leave a bad taste.

908
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:28,940
This time you couldn't ask for better.

909
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,900
Yes?

910
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,460
- Yes, Colonel?
- You wanted to see me, sir.

911
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:37,700
Oh, yes, yes!
Come in, Colonel, and sit down.

912
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,900
Colonel Dax. Your men died very well.

913
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,260
- Would you like some coffee, Colonel?
- No, thank you.

914
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,500
By the way, I've been told
that you ordered your artillery

915
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:55,380
to fire on your own men
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

916
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,300
I did what? Who told you that?

917
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:02,420
Colonel Dax came to me
last night with the story.

918
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:08,540
Colonel Dax, I've always known
that you were a disloyal officer,

919
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,940
but I never dreamed that you
would stoop to anything this low.

920
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:16,220
General, I have sworn statements from
Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter,

921
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:18,740
Captain Rousseau,
the battery commander.

922
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:21,180
I think it's infamous. Absolutely infamous.

923
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,380
Then there's no truth in the charge?

924
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,740
I don't see how you can even ask me that.

925
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,060
You cannot imagine
how glad I am to hear that.

926
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,700
I'm certain that
you'll come through it all right.

927
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,100
- Through what?
- There'll have to be an inquiry.

928
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,860
- An inquiry?
- These things never amount to much.

929
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,540
- The public forgets.
- Public?

930
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,500
You have the right to clear your name.

931
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:44,100
You cannot allow such insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

932
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,940
So that's it.

933
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,740
You're making me the goat -

934
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:53,420
the only completely innocent man
in this whole affair.

935
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,220
I have only one last thing
to say to you, George.

936
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,580
The man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier.

937
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:16,660
Well... It had to be done.

938
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:20,020
France cannot afford to have
fools guiding her military destiny.

939
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:23,180
I'm grateful to you for bringing
the matter to my attention.

940
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,580
Colonel Dax, how would you like
General Mireau's job?

941
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,540
- His what, sir?
- His job.

942
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,980
Let me get this straight, sir.

943
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,860
You're offering me
General Mireau's command?

944
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,540
Come, Colonel Dax,
don't overdo the surprise.

945
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,860
You've been after the job from the start.
We all know that, my boy.

946
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,740
I may be many things, sir,
but I'm not your boy.

947
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,620
I didn't mean to imply
any biological relationship.

948
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:53,180
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- Are you trying to provoke me, Colonel?

949
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,540
It would be a pity to lose your promotion -

950
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,780
a promotion you have
so very carefully planned for.

951
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:04,460
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

952
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,780
Colonel Dax!

953
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,980
You will apologise at once, or else
you'll be placed under arrest!

954
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,700
I apologise for not being
entirely honest with you.

955
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,420
I apologise for not
revealing my true feelings.

956
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:22,420
I apologise for not telling you sooner that
you are a degenerate, sadistic old man.

957
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:26,380
And you can go to hell before
I apologise to you now or ever again!

958
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,540
Colonel Dax,

959
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,900
you're a disappointment to me.

960
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,780
You have spoiled the keenness of
your mind by wallowing in sentimentality.

961
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:38,860
You really did want to save those men,

962
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,660
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

963
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:45,340
You're an idealist, and I pity you,
as I would the village idiot.

964
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,700
We're fighting a war,
a war we've got to win.

965
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,860
Those men didn't fight, so they were shot.

966
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:54,180
You bring charges against General
Mireau, so I insist that he answer them.

967
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,580
Wherein have I done wrong?

968
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,300
Because you don't know
the answer to that question...

969
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,940
I pity you.

970
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,100
Thank you.

971
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,540
Gentlemen, we have a little
special entertainment for you.

972
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:42,860
Sort of a little
diversion, as it were.

973
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:47,340
As my wife always says, what
is life without a little diversion?

974
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:53,700
Now, gentlemen, I give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy.

975
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:59,340
From Germany, the land of the Hun.

976
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:28,260
Gentlemen, a little pearl, washed
ashore by the tide of the war.

977
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:35,100
Sag den Herrschaften guten Tag.

978
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,460
Guten Tag.

979
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,500
Hey, talk in a civilised language!

980
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:44,300
It's true, the lady has her limitations.

981
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,380
As a matter of fact,
she has no talent at all.

982
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:51,300
Ex cept, that is...
Well, maybe a little natural talent.

983
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,740
The little lady can't dance,
she can't tell any jokes,

984
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,740
and she can't balance
rubber balls on her little nose.

985
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,300
Ah!

986
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:06,940
But she can sing like a bird.
She has a throat of gold.

987
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:10,100
Come on, honey!
Sing us a song! Come on!

988
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,900
Louder! Louder!

989

- Yes, Sergeant?

1004
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:43,180
We have orders to move back
to the front immediately.

1005
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,860
- Well, give the men a few minutes more.
- Yes, sir.
