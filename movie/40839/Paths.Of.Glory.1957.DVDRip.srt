"France 1916"

3
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,100
War began between Germany and France...

4
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,310
on August 3, 1914.

5
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,230
Five weeks later, the German army
had smashed its way...

6
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,770
to within 18 miles of Paris.

7
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,030
There the battered French miraculously
rallied at the Marne River...

8
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,450
and in a series of unexpected
counterattacks, drove the Germans back.

9
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,950
The front was stabilized
and shortly afterwards...

10
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,740
developed into a continuous line
of heavily fortified trenches...

11
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,200
zigzagging their way 500 miles...

12
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,750
from the English Channel
to the Swiss frontier.

13
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,750
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare...

14
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,010
the battle lines had changed
very little.

15
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,630
Successful attacks were measured
in hundreds of yards...

16
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,760
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

17
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,600
General Broulard, sir.

18
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,060
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Paul.

19
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,980
Wonderful seeing you again.
Really wonderful.

20
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,940
Well, this is splendid.

21
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,730
Superb! Grand, very grand.

22
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,440
Well, I've tried to create a pleasant
atmosphere in which to work.

23
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,820
You've succeeded marvellously. I wish I
had your taste in carpets and pictures.

24
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,080
You're much too kind, George.
Sit down, George.

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,080
- Thank you.
- I really haven't done very much.

26
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,580
The place is much the same
as it was when I moved in.

27
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,420
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,710
It's top secret and must go no further
than your chief of staff...

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,170
and not to him
unless you can trust his discretion.

30
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,470
Of course.

31
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,970
A group of armies is forming on this
front for an offensive very soon.

32
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,430
Headquarters is determined
to make a complete breakthrough.

33
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,810
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm really sorry.

34
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,310
I thought for a moment I knew what you
were going to say. Please go on.

35
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,810
What did you think
I was about to say?

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,110
- Something about the Ant Hill.
- You are a mind reader.

37
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,110
Well, it is a key position.

38
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,990
It's in my sector. To be perfectly
honest, I've heard some talk.

39
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,410
-There's nothing secret at headquarters.
-What do you think?

40
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,490
It's the key to the whole
German position in this sector.

41
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,530
They've held it for a year now...

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,080
and it looks as though they'll hold it
for another year if they want to.

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,790
I have formal orders to take
the Ant Hill no later than the tenth.

44
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,500
- That's the day after tomorrow.
- Don't you think that's ridiculous?

45
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,170
I don't imagine I'd be here
if I really thought that.

46
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,760
Paul, if there's one man in this army
who can do this for me, it's you.

47
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,800
It's out of the question.
Absolutely.

48
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,890
My division was cut to pieces.

49
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,520
What's left is in no position to even
hold the Ant Hill, let alone take it.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,690
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

51
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,020
Well, there was something else
I wanted to tell you...

52
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,190
however I'm sure you'll misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

53
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,900
- What was it?
- Oh, you'd be bound to misunderstand.

54
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,490
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

55
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,120
- What are you trying to say?
- Paul, the talk around headquarters...

56
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
is that you are being considered
for the 12th Corps.

57
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,830
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

58
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,830
I've pushed it all I can.

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,130
The 12th Corps needs a fighting general,
and your star is overdue.

60
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,380
We both know that your record
is good enough...

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,210
for you to refuse this assignment
on the grounds you've stated.

62
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,800
No one would question your opinion.
They'd simply get someone else to do it.

63
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,890
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion.

64
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks. Not before dinner.

65
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,690
I am responsible for the lives
of 8,000 men.

66
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,490
What is my ambition against that?

67
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,860
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

68
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,410
My men come first of all, George.

69
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,990
- And those men know it too.
- I know that.

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,160
You see, those men know
that I would never let them down.

71
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,910
That goes without saying.

72
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,540
One soldier's life means more to me
than all the decorations in France.

73
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,420
So, you think...

74
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,840
this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,260
I didn't say that, George.

76
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,930
Nothing is beyond those men
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

77
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,600
I don't want to push you
if you think it's ill-advised.

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,100
Don't worry. You couldn't do that
if you tried.

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,860
Of course, artillery
would make an enormous difference.

80
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,110
-What artillery support can you give me?
-Well, I'll see.

81
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,280
- What about replacements?
- We'll see what we can do...

82
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,570
but I feel sure that you can get along
with what you have.

83
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,570
We might just do it.

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,240
Paul, I knew that I was right
to come to you.

85
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,330
You are the man to take the Ant Hill.
As for that star--

86
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,500
That has nothing to do
with my decision!

87
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,500
If anything,
it would sway me the other way.

88
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,460
I realize that perfectly.

89
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,460
When do you see this coming off?

90
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,590
- No later than the day after tomorrow.
- We just might do it!

91
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,820
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

92
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,820
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name, soldier?

93
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,820
- Sir, Private Ferol, Company A.
- Aha. You married, Private?

94
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,620
- No, sir.
- I'll bet your mother's proud of you.

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,160
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Private, and good luck.

96
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,210
Thank you, sir.

97
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,670
- Morning, General.
- Good morning.

98
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,670
- Hello there, soldier.
- Sir.

99
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,840
- Ready to kill more Germans?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,880
Working over your rifle, I see.

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,470
That's the way.
The soldier's best friend.

102
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,760
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

103
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,760
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Well, good luck to you, soldier.

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,520
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,880
Hello there, soldier.

107
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,420
Ready to kill more Germans?

108
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,630
Is everything all right, soldier?

109
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,760
All right. Yes, sir.
I'm all right.

110
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,300
Good fella.

111
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,390
- Are you married, soldier?
- Married? Me, married?

112
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,020
- Yes. Have you got a wife?
- A wife? Have I got a wife?

113
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,310
Sir. He's a bit shellshocked.

114
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,730
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

115
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,230
Have you got a wife, soldier?

116
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,910
My wife? My wife. Yes, I have a wife.

117
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,910
I'm never gonna see her again.

118
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,450
Get a grip on yourself!
You're acting like a coward!

119
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,950
- I am a coward, sir.
- Snap out of it!

120
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,120
Sergeant, I want you to immediately
transfer this baby out of my regiment!

121
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,880
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him.

122
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,290
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

123
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,550
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

124
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,760
General, I'm convinced
that these tours of yours...

125
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,430
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men.

126
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,430
I think the fighting spirit
of the 701st derives from it.

127
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,310
No, Major. That spirit
was just born in them.

128
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,150
The general is coming, sir.

129
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,620
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
- I'm honored, General.

130
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,670
It's our privilege entirely.

131
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,750
Well, quite a neat little spot
you have here.

132
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,550
I'll reserve comment on the neatness,
sir, but it is little.

133
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,920
Pretty shy
on seating accommodations, though.

134
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,300
More than enough for me.
Never got the habit of sitting.

135
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,100
Like to be on my feet,
keep on the move.

136
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,060
I can vouch for that. I can hardly
get him behind a desk to sign an order.

137
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,270
That's the way I am, you know, Dax.

138
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,270
I can't understand these
armchair officers--

139
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,440
fellows trying to fight from behind
a desk, waving papers at the enemy.

140
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,690
Worrying about whether a mouse is going
to run up their pants leg.

141
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,320
I don't know. If I could choose between
mice and Mausers, I'd take the mice.

142
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,450
You'll never make me believe that.

143
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,040
Seriously, though, if a man's a ninny...

144
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,750
let him put on a dress
and hide under the bed.

145
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,790
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then by heavens, he's got to be one.

146
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,000
He's got to fight. He can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

147
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,840
- That's my credo.
- I think I have to agree with you...

148
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,880
presenting your case
so convincingly, sir.

149
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,050
- You've never failed to live up to it.
- You'd like a look around?

150
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,840
Yes, Colonel.

151
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,680
Here's something to see.
The Ant Hill.

152
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,220
About as good a view as you can get
without actually being there.

153
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,060
Ha-ha. That won't be long now, will it?

154
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,810
Ah.

155
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,150
Yeah.

156
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,900
Well, I've seen much more formidable
objectives.

157
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,990
Much, much worse.

158
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,870
Well, not something
we can grab and run away with...

159
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,080
but certainly pregnable.

160
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,040
-Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it?
-Why?

161
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,380
Well, like something
to do with giving birth.

162
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,880
Oh, yes, quite. You're right on
your toes this morning, Colonel.

163
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,380
Even sharper than usual.
But we mustn't forget...

164
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,550
the colonel was perhaps the foremost
criminal lawyer in all France.

165
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,470
- Of course, General.
- Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

166
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,890
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

167
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,980
We drew some artillery.
Twenty-nine casualties, sir.

168
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,110
Yes, I noticed it on the road in.
Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

169
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,360
All swarmed together like flies,
just waiting for someone to swat them.

170
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,400
Well, they never learn, it seems. They
get in a tight spot under heavy fire--

171
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,070
gang up every time--
herd instinct, I suppose.

172
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,700
- Kind of a lower animal sort of thing.
- Kind of a human thing, it seems to me.

173
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,740
Don't you make a distinction between
the two, Major?

174
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,450
Oh, yes, very regrettable, of course.

175
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,040
Yes, indeed. Major, will you excuse us
for a few minutes?

176
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,210
Yes, sir. Of course.

177
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,710
Colonel.

178
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,970
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

179
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,970
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Ant Hill.

180
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,980
Colonel, your regiment is going to
take the Ant Hill tomorrow.

181
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,770
- You know the condition of my men, sir.
- Naturally, men are gonna be killed.

182
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,230
Possibly a lot of them.
They'll absorb bullets and shrapnel...

183
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,650
and by doing so make it possible
for others to get through.

184
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,990
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

185
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,820
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

186
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,620
Say, five percent killed by our own
barrage. That's a generous allowance.

187
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,080
Ten percent more in getting through
no-man's-land...

188
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,410
and 20 percent more
getting through the wire.

189
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,380
That leaves 65 percent
with the worst part of the job over.

190
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,460
Let's say another 25 percent
in actually taking the Ant Hill.

191
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,550
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

192
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,510
General, you're saying that
more than half my men will be killed.

193
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,350
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay,
Colonel.

194
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,850
- But we will have the Ant Hill.
- But will we, sir?

195
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm depending on you, Colonel.
All France is depending on you.

196
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,520
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

197
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need
a flag waved to get me to charge.

198
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,240
I don't like your comparison of the flag
of France to a bullfighter's cape.

199
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,490
I meant nothing disrespectful
to the flag of France, sir.

200
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,080
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,
but a patriot is an honest man.

201
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,910
Not everyone has always thought so.
Samuel Johnson said something else.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,420
What was that?

203
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,420
- Nothing, really.
- What do you mean, "Nothing, really"?

204
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,880
- Well, sir, nothing really important.
- When I ask a question, it's important.

205
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,510
- Now, who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

206
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,300
All right. What did he have to say
about patriotism?

207
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,600
He said it was the last refuge
of a scoundrel, sir. I'm sorry.

208
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
I meant nothing personal.

209
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,020
You're tired, Dax.
You're very tired.

210
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,520
It's you who are exhausted,
not your men, and it's my fault.

211
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,320
I've given you one impossible task
after another. You need rest badly.

212
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,650
- I haven't said that!
- And you never would, either.

213
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,860
Therefore you're not going to have
any say-so about it, Colonel.

214
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,650
I'm ordering you on indefinite furlough.

215
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,320
General, you can't take me away from
my men. You can't do that to me, sir!

216
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,040
Not to you, Dax. For you. For your good
and for the good of your men.

217
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,040
The good of my men, sir?

218
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,870
If an officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

219
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,040
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you,
but I must have enthusiastic support.

220
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,380
Not once have you said that your men
can take the Ant Hill.

221
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,390
We'll take the Ant Hill.

222
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,850
If any soldiers in the world
can take it...

223
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,270
we'll take the Ant Hill.

224
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,680
And when you do, your men will be
relieved and get a long rest.

225
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,660
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune
reporting, sir.

226
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,950
You took your time.

227
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,910
We prepared as quick as we could, sir.
We had to alert the sentries.

228
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,670
All right. You men, at ease.
This is a reconnaissance patrol.

229
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,590
German wire, machine gun posts,
identification of bodies.

230
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,050
There'll only be the three of us,
and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

231
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,430
We go out to the left, and we come back
through Post Six on the right.

232
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,220
- Is everything all clear at Post Six?
- All the sentries have been warned.

233
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,680
Number six will send up flares at
ten minute intervals starting at 0400.

234
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,640
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I told them that, sir.

235
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,060
The sergeant says every five minutes
is too much. It'll draw artillery.

236
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,190
Quite a strategist, this sergeant.
What's his name?

237
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,650
I don't know, sir.

238
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,990
All right. You men wait outside.
I'll join you in a minute.

239
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,620
Would you mind telling us
the password, sir?

240
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,160
- Calais.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,000
- He's fortifying himself.
- It smelled like heaven.

242
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,130
I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

243
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,090
Well, at least
he could have passed it around, the pig.

244
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,220
Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

245
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,890
We went to school together
before the war.

246
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,470
He thinks I don't have enough respect
for him. He's right.

247
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,190
You gentlemen are ready?

248
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,150
- Everything clear and understood?
- Yes, sir.

249
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,610
The lane through our wire
is right out in front here.

250
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,990
The machine guns are pointing
at the opening.

251
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,160
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.

252
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,620
All right, men. Let's go.

253
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,430
- What's that?
- I don't know.

254
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,890
Lejeune, move out and look that over.
We'll cover you.

255
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,310
Split up a night patrol?

256
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,310
Move out, Lejeune.

257
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,880
I don't like this.
Let's get out of here.

258
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,180
We haven't given him enough time.

259
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,020
- If we wait, they'll get us too.
- We've got to wait for him.

260
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,570
He must be dead.
Where is he?

261
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,080
- Well!
- Surprised, Lieutenant?

262
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,710
Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

263
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,620
You didn't wait around to find out,
did you, Lieutenant?

264
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,210
Look here. What do you mean?

265
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,550
I mean you ran like a rabbit
after you killed Lejeune.

266
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,170
Killed Lejeune?
What are you talking about?

267
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,720
I don't think I like your tone.

268
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,050
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

269
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,350
Oh, well, I must be mistaken, then, sir.

270
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,930
An officer wouldn't do that.

271
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,430
A man wouldn't do it.

272
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,440
Only a thing would.

273
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,440
A sneaky, booze-guzzling...

274
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,110
yellow-bellied rat
with a bottle for a brain...

275
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,820
- That's enough.
- and a streak of spit for a spine.

276
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,110
- You got yourself into a mess.
- Oh, I have?

277
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,700
Well, you've got yourself in a worse
one. First, general insubordination.

278
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,790
Second, threatening
your superior officer.

279
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,160
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

280
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,790
How do you think those charges
are going to look on paper?

281
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,080
Not half as bad as these.

282
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,130
Endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness...

283
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,220
drunk on duty, wanton murder
of one of your own men...

284
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,390
and cowardice in the face
of the enemy.

285
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,930
Phillip, have you ever tried
to bring charges against an officer?

286
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,810
It's my word against yours. Whose word
do you think they are going to believe?

287
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,940
Or let me put it another way.

288
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,940
Whose word are they going to accept?

289
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,480
I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

290
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,650
So far, all I have written
in this report...

291
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,240
is that you and Lejeune were killed
while out on patrol.

292
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,490
I'll fix this to read
that you made your way back...

293
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,870
after becoming separated
during the skirmish.

294
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,620
- That'll end the matter.
- You killed Lejeune. You know that.

295
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,370
- It was an accident.
- You threw that grenade.

296
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,130
I'd give anything if it hadn't happened.
That's the truth.

297
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,000
Honestly, I know you don't like me, but
what kind of a man do you think I am?

298
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,180
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

299
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,800
- I've been waiting for your report.
- We found out a thing or two.

300
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,600
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

301
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,810
- How'd it happen?
- It's in the report, sir.

302
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,020
- Let's have it.
- It isn't quite finished yet, sir.

303
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,150
That's all, Corporal.
You did a good night's work.

304
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,520
Should feel very proud of yourself.
Go get some sleep.

305
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,030
Yes, sir.

306
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,700
- How'd you lose Lejeune?
- Machine gun fire, sir.

307
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,740
He coughed. Almost got us all killed.

308
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,120
Finish that report and get it
to my dugout immediately.

309
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,620
Yes, sir.

310
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,380
The artillery starts at 0515.

311
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,470
The First Battalion
will move out at 0530.

312
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,720
When the leading elements
have cleared the German wires...

313
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,600
the second wave, consisting of
the Second and Third Battalions...

314
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,100
minus two companies in reserve,
will move out.

315
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,140
In no case later than 0540.

316
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,020
That's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

317
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,360
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery
preparation all that we can expect?

318
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,900
The feeling is that any more will give
them too much time to get organized.

319
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,200
What's the weather supposed to be like
tomorrow, sir?

320
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,370
Too good.

321
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,410
No chance of rain or fog?

322
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,960
The forecast is for sun all day.

323
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,420
If, or perhaps I should say when,
we take the Ant Hill...

324
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,460
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

325
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,920
General Mireau, who, by the way, will be
personally observing the attack...

326
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,880
has promised support from the 72nd
by sundown tomorrow...

327
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,140
which means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

328
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,640
Any more questions?

329
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,610
Well, gentlemen, good luck. I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

330
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,360
Let's get some sleep.

331
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,610
I'm not afraid of dying tomorrow,
only of getting killed.

332
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,610
- That's as clear as mud.
- Which would you rather be done in by?

333
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,370
- A bayonet or a machine gun?
- Machine gun, naturally.

334
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,200
That's my point. They're both pieces
of steel ripping into your guts...

335
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,080
only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

336
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,960
- What does that prove?
- That proves most of us...

337
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,210
are more afraid of getting hurt
than getting killed.

338
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,630
Look at Bernard. He panics when it comes
to gas. Gas doesn't bother me a bit.

339
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,260
He's seen photos of gas cases,
but it doesn't mean anything to me.

340
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,680
But I'll tell you something. I'd hate
like the devil to be without my tin hat.

341
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,310
But I don't mind not having a tin hat
for my tail.

342
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,770
- Why's that?
- That's where your brains are.

343
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,270
Because I know a wound to the head
will hurt more than one in the tail.

344
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,400
The tail is just meat, but the head--
the head is all bone.

345
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,810
- Speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

346
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,400
Aside from the bayonet,
what are you most afraid of?

347
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,730
- High explosives.
- Exactly. It's the same with me.

348
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,740
Because I know that it can chew you up
worse than anything else.

349
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,410
Look, it's like I'm trying to tell you.
If you're really afraid of dying...

350
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,490
you'd be living in a funk
all the rest of your life...

351
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,830
because you know you've got to go
someday, any day.

352
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,370
If death is what you really fear, why
should you care about what kills you?

353
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,000
You're too smart for me, Professor.
All I know is nobody wants to die.

354
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,840
Through to Division, sir.
Through to Polygon.

355
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,810
Everything quiet.
All units report themselves ready.

356
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,520
Zero minus two.

357
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,520
May I offer you gentlemen
some cognac?

358
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,020
Thank you, sir.

359
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,730
After you, sir.

360
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,900
To France.

361
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,780
Minus 15, 14, 13...

362
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,000
ten, nine, eight...

363
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,880
seven, six, five, four...

364
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,250
three, two, one, zero.

365
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,070
Sergeant, where's B Company?

366
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,070
I don't know, sir.

367
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,960
- Where in heaven's name are they?
- On the left, sir.

368
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,120
Where are the rest? Zero plus one,
and they're still in the trenches.

369
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,960
They're not advancing. Miserable
cowards! They're not advancing!

370
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,010
The barrage is getting away from them.
They're still in the trenches!

371
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,510
Yes, sir.

372
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,510
Captain Nichols.

373
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,050
Yes, sir?

374
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,970
Order the 75's to commence
firing on our own positions.

375
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,940
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

376
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,400
No, sir, but I respectfully
ask to--

377
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,730
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

378
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,730
No, sir.

379
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,780
- Then carry it out, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,620
Hello, Polygon?
This is Division.

381
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,620
Batteries One and Two commence firing...

382
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:58,670
on coordinates 32-58-78.

383
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,340
Batteries One and Two
to commence firing...

384
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,470
on coordinates 32-58-78, over.

385
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,980
General, the battery commander
reports those are our own positions.

386
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,640
He says it must be a mistake.

387
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,480
- Confirm the order, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,980
There is no mistake.
The order is confirmed.

389
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,940
Battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order...

390
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,700
unless it is in writing and signed
by the general, over.

391
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,990
General, battery commander reports
he cannot execute such an order...

392
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,240
unless it is in writing and signed
by the general.

393
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,370
- Give me that phone.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,290
General Mireau speaking.

395
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,170
Battery commander speaking, sir.

396
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,670
The troops are mutinying, refusing
to advance. Fire until further notice!

397
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,590
With all respect, sir, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men...

398
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,220
unless you are willing to take full
and undivided responsibility for it.

399
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,760
Captain Rousseau, are you going
to obey my order?

400
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,430
I must have a written order before
I can execute such a command, sir.

401
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,890
Supposing you are killed?
Then where will I be?

402
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,480
You'll be in front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning!

403
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,030
Hand over your command. Report yourself
under arrest to my headquarters!

404
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,830
Roget!

405
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:36,170
- Why are your men still in here?
- Impossible, sir. Major Vignon is dead.

406
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,420
Get these men out of the trenches!

407
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,380
Come on! Let's get ready for another
try! Get these men out of here!

408
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,720
I've tried three times!
Look at all the casualties.

409
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,550
All right, let's give it another try!
Come on!

410
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,110
It's impossible, sir.
All the men are falling back.

411
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,740
Sir, I respectfully submit
to the colonel.

412
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,450
Pardon. Your remarks to me
were very unfair, sir.

413
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,200
It's just impossible.

414
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,960
General, according to first reports, the
attack has failed all along the line.

415
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,630
The men are falling back
to our own trenches.

416
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,510
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for the
immediate relief of the 701st Regiment.

417
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,470
Send them to the Chateau de L'aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to me.

418
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,640
Major Gouderc, assemble
a general court martial.

419
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,310
Have it ready to meet at 3:00
tomorrow afternoon.

420
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,310
If those sweethearts won't face German
bullets, they'll face French ones!

421
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,110
I ordered an attack.
Your troops refused to attack.

422
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,660
Our troops did attack, sir,
but they could make no headway.

423
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,290
Because they didn't try. I saw it
myself. Half never left the trenches.

424
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,250
A third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense.

425
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,960
Don't quibble over fractions.
The fact remains...

426
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,840
a good part of your men
never left their own trenches.

427
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,590
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have ten men
from each company in your regiment...

428
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,420
tried under penalty of death
for cowardice.

429
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,090
- Penalty of death?
- For cowardice!

430
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,390
They've skim milk in their veins
instead of blood.

431
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,390
It's the reddest milk I've ever seen.
My trenches are soaked with it!

432
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,600
- That's just about enough out of you.
- I'm not gonna mince words--

433
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,270
If you continue in this manner, I shall
be forced to place you under arrest.

434
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:40,020
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it rather bluntly.

435
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,690
This is not a trial, but it does
bear certain aspects of one...

436
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,190
and Colonel Dax technically
is cast in the role of the defense.

437
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,910
In view of the charges, a court would
grant latitude in presenting his case.

438
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,200
Latitude is one thing,
insubordination another.

439
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,330
I am merely offering an opinion,
General.

440
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,500
Please do not feel constrained
to accept it.

441
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,420
I'm perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

442
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,210
I'm sorry, sir. I certainly didn't
intend to be insubordinate.

443
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,260
My only aim is to remind you
of the heroism these men have shown...

444
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,380
on every occasion in the past.

445
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,390
We're not talking about the past.
We're talking about the present.

446
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,930
But don't you see, sir?
They're not cowards.

447
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,180
If some didn't leave the trenches,
it must have been impossible.

448
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,810
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

449
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,770
We can't leave it up to the men
to decide whether an order is possible.

450
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,940
If it was impossible, the only proof
of that would be their dead bodies...

451
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,440
lying in the trenches.

452
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,570
They're scum, Colonel.

453
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,240
The whole rotten regiment is a pack of
sneaking, whining, tail-dragging curs.

454
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,780
Do you really believe that?

455
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,120
Yes, I do.
That's exactly what I believe.

456
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,160
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

457
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,420
Why not shoot the entire regiment?
I'm perfectly serious.

458
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,920
You're missing the point entirely. We
don't want to slaughter the French army.

459
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,960
All we want
is to set an example.

460
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,340
Oh, if it's an example you want,
then take me.

461
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,840
- Take you?
- Yes, sir. If you want an example...

462
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,550
one man will do as well as a hundred.

463
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,100
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

464
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,270
Come, Colonel.
I think you're overwrought.

465
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,980
This is not a question of officers.

466
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,190
Paul, we don't want to overdo
this thing.

467
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,900
Suppose we just make it a dozen.

468
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,070
I was talking of a hundred men.
Now we're down to 12.

469
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,530
Paul, let's not haggle over this
anymore.

470
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,660
Let's get it settled once and for all,
so we can all live with it.

471
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,830
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see proper justice meted out.

472
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,960
I've spent my entire life in the army.

473
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,460
I've always tried to be true
to my principles.

474
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,460
It's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

475
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,630
I'll settle for this:

476
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,300
Have the company commanders select one
man from each company in the first wave.

477
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,350
- Three in all.
- Well, that's very reasonable, Paul.

478
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,230
The court martial will meet
at the chateau at 3:00 this afternoon.

479
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,940
- Will that be convenient for you?
- I won't be there, Paul.

480
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,400
You won't be there?

481
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,900
No. I think it best that you handle
this matter on your own.

482
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,940
Probably so.

483
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,490
General Mireau, if it's possible...

484
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,820
I'd like to be appointed counsel
for the accused.

485
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,610
I'll take it under consideration.

486
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,570
Oh, we can permit that.
Consider it settled, Colonel.

487
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Thank you, sir.

488
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,370
Noon straight up, Paul. I hope that
you can stay for lunch, Colonel.

489
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,500
George, I'm afraid the colonel
won't have time.

490
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,460
Don't deny it, Paul,
you've been hiding this man.

491
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,000
Keeping him for your own.
I think that was very selfish of you.

492
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,260
Thank you, General, but I'm afraid there
isn't much time between now and 3:00.

493
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,260
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

494
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,990
- Yes, Captain? What is it?
- You ordered me to report to you, sir.

495
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,120
- Captain Rousseau, Battery Commander.
- Yes, of course.

496
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,040
I wanted to speak to you about
some of your shells falling short.

497
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,330
I haven't time now. Report back
to your command until further orders.

498
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,830
Yes, sir.

499
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,460
- Bad stuff. It demoralizes the men.
- I quite agree with you.

500
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,220
The best solution is to shelve him
to another outfit.

501
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,340
A court of inquiry ought to roast him
a bit first.

502
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,890
Well, in cases like shells falling
short, I always try to avoid an inquiry.

503
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,430
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

504
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,770
Shelving will be the best discipline
for him in my opinion.

505
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,810
- Perhaps you're right.
- Oh, would you excuse me for a moment?

506
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,810
A regimental matter for the colonel.

507
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,230
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

508
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,860
There'll be Captain Sancy,
Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

509
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,780
- Yes, sir.
- Have them meet me in half an hour.

510
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,780
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel Dax?

511
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,700
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like a word.

512
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,120
Certainly, sir.

513
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,790
- Let's be sensible about this.
- Sensible, sir?

514
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,800
Listen to me, Dax. You can cut out
this fancy talk with me, understand?

515
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,720
General Broulard seemed to think
you're funny. I don't.

516
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,010
- I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon. Is that an order?

517
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,890
Colonel Dax, when this mess
is cleaned up, I'll break you!

518
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,930
I'll find an excuse,
and I'll break you to the ranks.

519
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,890
I'll ruin you. It will be
just what you deserve...

520
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,520
showing such little loyalty
to your commanding officer.

521
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,650
That's all, Colonel.

522
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,550
General Mireau feels that the attack
on the Ant Hill yesterday morning...

523
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,300
failed because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the First Battalion.

524
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,800
Each of you is to select one man
from your company...

525
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,600
place him under arrest and have him
appear before a general court martial...

526
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,350
no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.

527
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,770
The charge is cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

528
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,810
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

529
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,160
But Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune
on that patrol...

530
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,620
and then blackmailed me
into keeping quiet about it!

531
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,250
- That's why he picked me!
- Corporal, I understand your feelings.

532
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,000
But that has nothing to do with
the charges you're being tried for.

533
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,960
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do.

534
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,680
But who else will?
You've got no witnesses.

535
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,680
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonize the court.

536
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,270
When we get clear of this, I'm going
into the story of that patrol again.

537
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:08,230
Sir, in my case, Captain Renouart
had the sergeant draw lots.

538
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,440
I was picked purely by chance.

539
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,980
You were lucky. Look at me.

540
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,530
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

541
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,860
Me, a social undesirable.

542
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,570
I didn't act like a coward.
Picking by lots! Is that fair?

543
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,780
Gentlemen!

544
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,580
You've all got to understand that the
reason you were picked is immaterial.

545
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,660
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

546
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,300
Stick to your stories, and don't let
the prosecutor shake you out of them.

547
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,840
Now remember, you'll be soldiers
in the presence of superior officers...

548
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,880
so act like what you are.

549
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,720
Soldiers.

550
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,300
And brave ones at that.

551
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,770
I've been in the room you'll be sitting
in. The sun will be in your faces...

552
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,190
so don't let it seem as if you're
dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

553
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,860
When you answer questions,
look the judges in the eye.

554
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,860
Don't whine, plead or make speeches.
That's my job.

555
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,900
Simple statements. Short.

556
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,990
But make them so they can be heard
all over the room.

557
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:12,030
And try not to repeat yourselves.
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

558
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,580
We haven't much time. The court martial
begins in about an hour.

559
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,580
I've got notes to look at.

560
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,710
Good luck.

561
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,710
Thank you, Colonel.

562
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,370
The court martial is opened.
Prisoners may be seated.

563
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,630
This is a general court martial. We'll
dispense with unnecessary formalities.

564
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,300
These men are charged with cowardice
in the face of the enemy...

565
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,840
and will be tried for that offense.

566
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,140
Mr. Prosecutor.

567
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,470
Call the accused, Private Ferol.

568
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,640
Mr. President, will the prosecutor...

569
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,480
question the witnesses
without even reading the indictment?

570
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,150
Please don't take up the court's time
with technicalities.

571
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,980
The indictment is lengthy
and there's no point in reading it.

572
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,650
- The defense has a right--
- The indictment is...

573
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,320
that the accused showed cowardice
in the face of the enemy...

574
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,570
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

575
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,620
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

576
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,450
Call the accused, Private Ferol.

577
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,300
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir?

578
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,430
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Ant Hill?

579
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,680
- Yes, sir.
- Did you refuse to advance?

580
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,720
No, sir.

581
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,890
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

582
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,520
How far did you advance?

583
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,850
- To about the middle of no-man's-land.
- Then what did you do?

584
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,270
There were machine gun bullets
landing all around--

585
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,940
Answer the question.
What did you do?

586
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,410
Well, I saw that me and Meyer--

587
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,620
I didn't ask what you saw.

588
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,700
The court has no concern
with your visual experiences.

589
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,120
- My what, sir?
- You will reply to the question.

590
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,920
Yes, sir. What question was it?

591
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,920
You advanced to the middle of
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

592
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,710
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

593
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:59,760
- I went back, sir.
- In other words, Private Ferol...

594
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,430
you retreated.

595
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,010
Yes, sir.

596
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,720
That's all. The accused
may return to his seat.

597
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,060
Just a minute.

598
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,770
Mr. President, I'd like to question
the witness, if I may.

599
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,520
Proceed, Colonel.

600
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:21,400
Thank you. Private Ferol, when you
reached the middle of no-man's-land...

601
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
were you alone with Private Meyer?

602
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,700
Yes, sir.

603
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,990
What happened to the rest
of your company?

604
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:31,490
Well, I don't know, sir. I guess the
rest of them had been killed or wounded.

605
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,540
You found yourself in the middle of
no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer?

606
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,830
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn't you attack single-handed?

607
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,920
Why didn't you storm the Ant Hill alone?

608
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:48,220
Just me and Meyer? You're kidding, sir.

609
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,550
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.
Thank you. That's all.

610
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,350
I don't see the point of this line
of questioning.

611
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,810
Well, I'm attempting to indicate, sir,
the utter absurdity...

612
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,440
of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

613
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,900
Mr. Prosecutor.

614
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,400
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated?

615
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,240
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

616
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,450
I knew we should have took Ant Hill,
but we came on back.

617
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,790
That's all.

618
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,080
The accused may return to his seat.

619
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,550
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

620
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,390
Yes, sir, until I was ordered back
to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

621
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,560
How far did you advance?

622
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,560
Into the wire, sir.

623
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,440
The enemy wire, I suppose.

624
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,440
No, sir. It was our wire.

625
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:00,240
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

626
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,280
No, sir. I didn't.

627
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,990
How far would you say that was?
How many meters?

628
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,740
Well, I advanced as far as I could.

629
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,000
How many meters?

630
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,250
Not many.

631
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,210
Not many?

632
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
Now, Private Arnaud...

633
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,340
before you were ordered back...

634
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,760
did you urge your fellow soldiers
forward?

635
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,760
Most were dead or wounded before they
got three steps beyond the trenches.

636
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,180
Reply to the question.

637
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,850
I didn't urge them on.
No, sir.

638
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,020
Thank you.

639
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,320
Private Arnaud, at ease, please.

640
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,540
Aside from your sad failure to give
throat to spirited battle cries...

641
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,580
was your behavior different
in any respect...

642
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,500
from that of the other men?

643
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,370
Objection.
That's a matter of conjecture.

644
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,670
Sustained.

645
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,550
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

646
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,010
No, sir.

647
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,470
Is it true that you've been designated
a coward...

648
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,180
simply and purely because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

649
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,180
Yes, sir.

650
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,350
I don't see that that's significant.

651
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:27,230
It's accepted practice in the French
army to pick examples by lot.

652
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,850
Since this entire company advanced
only a few meters...

653
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,900
picking by lot was eminently fair
in this case.

654
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,730
Well, I'd like to point out that this
soldier has distinguished himself...

655
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,190
in some of the bloodiest battles
of the war.

656
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,320
With the court's permission,
I'll read citations for bravery...

657
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,740
that he's already earned on
two occasions.

658
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,580
First, citations
in the Orders in the Army for bravery--

659
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,080
That's immaterial. The accused is not
being tried for his former bravery...

660
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,170
but for his recent cowardice.

661
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,590
Medals are no defense.

662
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,420
May I call witnesses to his character?

663
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,260
You may not.

664
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,010
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

665
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,680
Mr. President, no one
in the entire regiment...

666
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,930
got anywhere near the German wire,
including myself.

667
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,850
Call the next accused.

668
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,150
If you're through, Colonel.

669
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,730
Thank you.

670
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,030
The prisoner
may return to his seat.

671
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,080
- So you never even left the trenches?
- No, sir.

672
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,460
That's all.

673
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,670
Corporal Paris,
why didn't you leave the trenches?

674
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:52,050
Major Vignon was shot, and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

675
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,880
And were you lying unconscious in
the trenches during the entire attack?

676
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Yes, sir.

677
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,350
- That's all.
- Have you any witnesses?

678
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:08,400
No. Everybody was too busy to notice me,
and there were many others lying dead.

679
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,480
- But you have no witnesses?
- No, sir.

680
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:15,400
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

681
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,690
That could've been
self-inflicted later.

682
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,240
Thank you.
You may stand down.

683
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:30,290
Mr. Prosecutor,
you can make your plea.

684
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,710
Gentlemen of the court...

685
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,720
this case speaks
for itself.

686
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,720
All of us witnessed the
regrettable attack yesterday morning.

687
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,680
And I submit
that that attack...

688
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,190
was a stain
on the flag of France...

689
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,560
a blot on the honor...

690
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,980
of every man, woman and child
in the French nation.

691
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,700
It is to us that the sad...

692
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:13,490
distressing,
repellent duty falls, gentlemen.

693
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,790
I ask this court...

694
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,870
to find the accused guilty...

695
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,550
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the code of military justice.

696
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,340
Thank you.

697
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,930
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

698
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,480
Gentlemen of the court,
there are times when I'm ashamed...

699
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,780
to be a member of the human race,
and this is one such occasion.

700
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:59,660
It's impossible for me to summarize
the case for the defense since...

701
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,330
the court never allowed me a reasonable
opportunity to present my case.

702
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:06,330
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

703
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,000
Yes, sir.

704
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,040
I protest against being prevented
from introducing evidence...

705
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:17,630
that I consider
vital to the defense.

706
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,510
The prosecution
presented no witnesses.

707
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,510
There has never been a written
indictment of charges...

708
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,930
made against the defendants.

709
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,680
And lastly I protest
against the fact that...

710
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,770
no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

711
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:45,400
The attack yesterday morning
was no stain on the honor of France...

712
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,280
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

713
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,700
But this court martial
is such a stain...

714
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,540
and such a disgrace.

715
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:59,620
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

716
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,210
Gentlemen of the court...

717
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:06,130
to find these men guilty
would be a crime...

718
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,470
to haunt each of you
till the day you die.

719
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,890
I can't believe
that the noblest impulse of man--

720
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:24,020
his compassion for another--
can be completely dead here.

721
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,270
Therefore I humbly beg you...

722
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,940
show mercy to these men.

723
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,240
The accused
will be escorted back to the guard room.

724
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:45,330
The hearing is closed.
The court will now retire to deliberate.

725
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,960
There will be a guard
of six men under arms.

726
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,460
Rifles loaded, bayonets fixed,
two men to each prisoner.

727
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,840
Any sign of trouble, the prisoners
will be instantly covered...

728
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,880
and if the trouble doesn't subside
at once, the prisoner will be shot.

729
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:01,390
Everything must go off without a hitch
with the least possible delay.

730
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,260
It shouldn't be hurried.
There must be no fumbling around.

731
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:08,560
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible...

732
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,640
for any lack of order
or any mistakes.

733
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:16,810
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame and with interest...

734
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,610
to any one of you
who fails in his duties.

735
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,490
The execution
will take place at 7:00...

736
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,490
according to the verdict
of the court martial.

737
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,990
Detail, attention!
Dismissed!

738
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,840
- This is compliments of General Mireau.
- Duck!

739
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,140
- Well, tell him thanks.
- Don't blame me, soldier.

740
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,430
Hey, ugly, what are we supposed
to eat this with, our fingers?

741
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:58,270
The guard says
you can't have any knives or forks.

742
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,480
Is this supposed to be
our last meal or something?

743
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,560
It isn't supposed to be our last meal.
It is our last meal.

744
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,860
This duck is terrific.

745
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,320
You suppose
they'd put anything in the food?

746
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,900
First they poison us,
then they shoot us?

747
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:18,660
- I think they put something in it.
- Like what?

748
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,870
Like, uh-- like something
to make us groggy or something.

749
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:25,120
What would be wrong with that
if they did?

750
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,750
Maybe nothing for you, but I'm
going to get out of this somehow.

751
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,500
- And I don't want to be drugged.
- How are you going to get out?

752
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,880
Chew your way
through that stone wall?

753
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,970
Colonel Dax,
he'll see us through.

754
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,930
Listen, we got to get out of here.
They're going to kill us if we don't.

755
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:46,600
- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's got to be a way.

756
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,520
How many guys you think
they've got out there?

757
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,360
They may have a couple of squads. That's
what it sounded like this morning.

758
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,730
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the Third Battalion.

759
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,150
Anyway, right now
we have no friends.

760
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,200
Why kid yourself?
We're not going to get out of this.

761
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,280
Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

762
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,540
You see that cockroach?

763
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,830
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

764
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,000
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

765
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,000
I'll be nothing,
and it'll be alive.

766
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:24,050
Now you got the edge on him.

767
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,300
Good evening, my sons.
I'm Father Du Pres.

768
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:39,230
- Is there any news?
- Yes, I'm afraid I bring you bad news.

769
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,150
You must prepare for the worst.
Colonel Dax asked me to tell you.

770
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,860
- Oh, mercy, no!
- He's been in telephone contact...

771
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,320
with army headquarters but unable
to speak to General Broulard...

772
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,320
or to anyone in authority.

773
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,740
The same way at Division.
No one wants to be found.

774
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,580
- How much time do we have?
- You have plenty of time yet.

775
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,950
Certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves.

776
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,090
Father, will you
take this letter, please?

777
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,140
- Of course, my son.
- It's to my wife.

778
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,310
She won't understand this,
and I tried to explain it to her.

779
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,310
I'll see that she gets it.

780
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:28,270
Do you want me
to hear your confession?

781
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:32,810
Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

782
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,360
I know you're trying to help,
and I appreciate it...

783
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,440
but if I started praying now
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

784
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,450
Oh, that's an error, my son.

785
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:43,660
God is always ready
to listen to your prayers.

786
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,830
All right, Father.
Will you please hear my confession?

787
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,120
Yes.

788
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,210
Have faith in your creator, my son.
Death comes to us all.

789
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,090
In the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

790
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:02,550
That's really deep:
"Death comes to us all."

791
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,930
That really is deep.

792
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,640
Ferol, afraid your luck
isn't going to hold up?

793
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,810
Look! This is my religion.

794
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,180
Oh, great bottle, forgive me my sins,
for now I lay me down to sleep.

795
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,770
Bo-peep. May I drink of you first?
Thank you. Amen.

796
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:20,190
I understand your anguish, my son, but
you must not let it harden your heart.

797
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,480
May I tell you something, Father?

798
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,610
Back in my hometown,
there was a certain little cafe...

799
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,070
with an amusing sign
over the bar.

800
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,200
It read,

801
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,660
"Do not be afraid to ask for credit,
for our way of refusing is very polite."

802
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,580
- Come on. Sit down. You're drunk.
- Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

803
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,710
Can you get out of here
with your sanctimonious, pat answers?

804
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:43,120
- Are you hanging around to torture us?
- No, to help you with all my power.

805
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:46,340
- Your power? You have no power!
- No, but God has power.

806
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,090
- Does he? What a laugh!
- You can be saved.

807
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,880
Saved? I'll be saved?

808
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,090
Cut it out, Arnaud!

809
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,060
Father, get a doctor.
Quick.

810
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,990
That should keep him quiet long enough.
That's a nasty skull fracture, though.

811
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:25,450
- He may not live out the night.
- What are we supposed to do with him?

812
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:29,290
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher
so he won't slip when you tilt it.

813
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:32,420
Surely they won't execute
a man in that condition.

814
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:37,000
The sentence will be carried out.
I've already checked with the general.

815
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:41,050
If he's still alive in the morning,
pinch his cheeks a couple of times.

816
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,010
It may make him open his eyes.
The general wants him to be conscious.

817
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,510
Yes?

818
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,060
- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in.

819
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,690
Sergeant Boulanger
said you wanted to see me, sir.

820
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,110
Yes. We have a pretty unpleasant thing
on our hands in a few hours.

821
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,940
- You mean the execution?
- Yes.

822
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,070
Yes, sir.
It's very unfortunate.

823
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,570
Very unfortunate.
That's just how I feel about it.

824
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,370
- None of us are happy about it, sir.
- How'd you happen...

825
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,240
to pick Corporal Paris?

826
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:18,250
I-- I had to pick somebody, sir.

827
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:21,040
That's right. Of course,
you had no personal motive...

828
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,290
in picking Paris,
did you?

829
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,250
You picked him
because he was a coward, didn't you?

830
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,260
Did you or didn't you?

831
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,390
Yes, sir. I did.

832
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:37,890
Well, like you say,
somebody had to be picked.

833
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:41,600
- It was quite a problem, sir.
- Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

834
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,520
I have to pick someone to be in charge
of the firing squad tomorrow.

835
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,810
Do you have any objections
to taking the job?

836
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,570
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

837
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,650
Don't you feel well?

838
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:58,200
We-- No-- Yeah, I feel all right, sir.
It's just that l--

839
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,030
I-Is it too hot in here?
Would you like me to open a window?

840
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:07,370
Well, it's just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

841
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:12,960
There's nothing to it. First you help
the sergeant tie the men to the post...

842
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,090
and offer the men blindfolds--
if they want them, you tie them on.

843
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:21,340
Now, you take your position with
the firing squad, you raise your sword:

844
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,510
Ready, aim, fire.

845
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,760
Then you draw your revolver out,
walk forward...

846
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:30,140
and put a bullet
through each man's head.

847
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:34,810
Sir, I request that I be excused
from this duty.

848
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,980
Request denied.

849
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,980
- Colonel, l--
- You've got the job. It's all yours.

850
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,990
- That's all.
- Colonel, if you could just--

851
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,320
That's all!

852
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,990
Yes?

853
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:48,070
Excuse me, sir.
Colonel Dax?

854
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,700
- Yes?
- My name is Rousseau, sir.

855
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:54,250
- Captain of Artillery.
- What is it, Captain?

856
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:03,340
I have something to tell you that may
have a bearing on the court martial.

857
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,090
Come in.

858
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,640
Colonel. Good evening.

859
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,010
- Good evening.
- Come and sit down.

860
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,310
Thank you, sir. I-- I'm really sorry
to intrude on you in this way.

861
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:11,560
Not at all. Always delighted to see you,
Colonel Dax. Will you have a cigar?

862
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,810
No, thank you, sir.

863
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,110
- Well, l--
- Think you'll find it delicious.

864
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,650
I must apologize for not inviting you
to the party tonight...

865
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:23,070
but I'm afraid that it's
a dress affair.

866
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:24,910
Thank you, sir,
but I must confess...

867
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:28,450
that this is not entirely
a social visit.

868
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:33,080
Come, Dax.
Let's not go over all that ground again.

869
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,670
Though, I must admit
that judging....

870
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,750
from the casualties, the efforts of your
regiment must have been considerable.

871
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,210
How can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

872
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,130
Come, Colonel, you're choosing
to take a rather simple view of this.

873
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,550
The attack was impossible.
The general staff must have known that.

874
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,140
Colonel Dax, we think
we're doing a good job running the war.

875
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,230
You must be aware the general staff
is subject to unfair pressures...

876
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,310
from newspapers and politicians.

877
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,270
Maybe the attack against the Ant Hill
was impossible.

878
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,530
Perhaps it was an error of judgment
on our part.

879
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:11,700
On the other hand, if your men had been
more daring, they might have taken it.

880
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,280
Who knows? In any case...

881
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,120
why should we have to bear any more
criticism than we have to?

882
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,750
Aside from the fact that many of
your men never left the trenches...

883
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:24,290
there's the troops' morale,
don't forget.

884
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,290
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

885
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:29,340
These executions will be a perfect tonic
for the entire division.

886
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,000
There are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating...

887
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,920
than seeing someone else die.

888
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:37,010
- I never thought of that, sir.
- Colonel, troops are like children.

889
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:41,680
Just as a child wants his father
to be firm, troops crave discipline.

890
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,640
One way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

891
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,190
May I ask...

892
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,230
do you sincerely believe
the things you've said?

893
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,110
It's been a pleasure
discussing this with you, Colonel...

894
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:01,570
but I'm afraid that I'd better
be getting back to my guests.

895
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:04,570
Forgive me for having kept you
from your party.

896
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:10,330
Oh, by the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau...

897
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:13,750
ordered his own battery commander,
Captain Rousseau...

898
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:17,000
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

899
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:23,840
Of course, the captain refused
without a written order.

900
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,300
But General Mireau demanded that
he commence firing on our own trenches.

901
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,720
Well, again, Rousseau refused
without an order in writing...

902
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,060
but again he was ordered
and again he refused...

903
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:36,850
all in front of witnesses.

904
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:39,690
Do you actually
believe this fantastic story?

905
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:43,860
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

906
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,650
Battery Commander Rousseau, Captain
Nichols, the artillery spotter...

907
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:51,530
the telephone clerk
and my own deposition.

908
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:55,740
What has this got to do with the charge
against the condemned prisoners?

909
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:59,500
A general in a tantrum over the failure
of an impossible attack...

910
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:03,330
orders his artillery
to fire on his own men.

911
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:07,210
The same officer on the same day
orders a court martial...

912
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:11,300
in which three of his men
are sentenced to be shot.

913
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:16,470
General, what would your newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

914
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:21,260
- Are you trying to blackmail me?
- Sir, that's an ugly word...

915
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,100
but you are in a difficult position.

916
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:28,270
Too much has happened. Someone's
got to be hurt. The question is whom.

917
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,400
General Mireau's
assault on the Ant Hill failed.

918
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,240
His order to fire on his own troops
was refused.

919
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,740
But his attempt
to murder three innocent men...

920
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,240
to protect his own reputation will be
prevented by the general staff.

921
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:55,750
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax?
I've been rude to my guests too long.

922
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,900
Detail, halt!

923
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,860
Order, arms!

924
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,870
Fall out.

925
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:59,430
Courage, my sons.
The worst is over.

926
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,440
Good morning, Paris.

927
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,280
Good morning, Sergeant.
How are you today?

928
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,070
Not too bad. How are you?

929
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,540
You missed some good chow
in here last night.

930
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,960
What did you have?

931
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:33,170
Have you got a drink for us?

932
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,670
Take a swig of this.

933
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:42,510
It just occurred to me.
Funny thing. I--

934
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:45,470
I haven't had one sexual thought
since the court martial.

935
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:48,680
It's pretty extraordinary,
isn't it?

936
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,600
Act like a man.

937
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:55,520
- Listen, Paris. Are you listening?
- Yes.

938
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,690
There will be a lot of dignitaries,
newspapermen out there.

939
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,860
How do you want to be remembered?

940
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,240
- I don't want to die.
- Many of us will be joining you...

941
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,820
before this war's over.

942
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:07,360
I don't care.
I don't want to die.

943
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:12,950
- Please save me, Sergeant.
- I can't save you. No one can now.

944
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,250
This is the last decision
you'll have a chance to make on earth.

945
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:20,920
You can act like a man,
or we'll have to drag you out of here.

946
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,920
In the end, it will all be the same.
It's up to you.

947
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:45,150
Let's get busy. You and Ferol take your
coats off. No use hanging around here.

948
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,910
...with the help of Thy grace
to do penance...

949
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,540
to amend my life.

950
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,260
What do I have to die for, Father?

951
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:24,550
What do I have to die for?
I didn't do anything wr--

952
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,680
We do not question
the will of God, my son.

953
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:31,940
But I fought. I fought.
I fought on the battlefield.

954
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:35,520
Why don't they die?
Why don't they put them to death?

955
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:38,070
You showed courage in the face
of the enemy, my son.

956
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,030
Show it now before your own troops.

957
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:42,530
But I'm scared.
I'm scared.

958
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,910
Oh, Father, I'm scared.

959
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:50,370
Courage. Brace yourself.
Man, brace yourself.

960
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,960
He said, "This day,
thou shalt be with me in paradise."

961
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,920
- Really, Father?
- Yes, my son.

962
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:11,430
I'll never see my wife again,
Father.

963
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:16,180
I'll never see nobody again,
Father.

964
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,680
Courage, man.
Brace yourself.

965
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,350
- I can't help it.
- Brace yourself, man.

966
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,440
- I can't help it, Father.
- Oh, God, Almighty God.

967
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:30,360
- Oh, Christ. Strengthen me, God!
- Grant courage to this man...

968
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,150
who is about to die.

969
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:41,750
What do I have to die for,
Father?

970
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:46,330
What do I have to die for?

971
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,210
Forward, face!

972
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:01,300
Secure the men!

973
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,060
Detail, attention!

974
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,680
Forward, march!

975
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:18,780
Detail...

976
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,320
halt!

977
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,490
Left, face!

978
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:28,580
Repent.

979
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:01,770
In the name of the French people...

980
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:05,940
Corporal Phillip Paris,
Private Maurice Ferol...

981
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:10,320
and Private Pierre Arnaud
of the 701st Regiment...

982
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,490
having been found guilty of cowardice
in the face of the enemy...

983
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,790
are to be executed
by rifle fire immediately...

984
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:22,710
in accordance with the judgment
of the military court martial.

985
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:55,280
You want a blindfold?

986
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,780
Yes, Lieutenant. Please.

987
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,950
I don't want to die.

988
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,920
Did-- Did you want a blindfold?

989
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,760
I'm sorry.

990
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:51,910
Oh, Father.

991
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,340
Ready!

992
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,510
Aim!

993
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,300
Fire!

994
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:20,260
I'm awfully glad
you could be there, George.

995
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:23,140
This sort of thing
is always rather grim.

996
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,350
But this had splendor,
don't you think?

997
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,850
I have never seen an affair
of this sort handled any better.

998
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,980
The men died wonderfully.
There's always that chance...

999
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,320
that one will do something that
will leave everyone with a bad taste.

1000
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,110
This time,
you couldn't ask for better.

1001
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,200
Yes?

1002
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,910
- Yes, Colonel?
- You wanted to see me, sir.

1003
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:47,200
Oh, yes. Come in, Colonel.
Come in and sit down.

1004
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:52,710
Colonel,
your men died very well.

1005
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,340
- Would you like some coffee, Colonel?
- No, thank you, sir.

1006
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:02,300
Paul, it's been brought to my attention
that you ordered your artillery...

1007
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,720
to fire on your own men
during the attack on the Ant Hill.

1008
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,760
I did what?
Who told you that?

1009
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:12,930
Colonel Dax came to me last night
with the story.

1010
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:19,610
I've always known you were
a disloyal officer...

1011
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:23,070
but I never dreamed you would stoop
to anything so low as this.

1012
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:27,400
I've sworn statements from Captain
Nichols, your artillery spotter...

1013
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:30,240
Captain Rousseau, the battery commander
who refused your order.

1014
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,580
I think it's
absolutely infamous.

1015
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,950
Then there's no truth to the charge
made by Colonel Dax?

1016
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,410
I don't see
how you could even ask me that.

1017
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,920
You cannot imagine
how glad I am to hear that, Paul.

1018
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,540
I'm certain
you'll come through it all right.

1019
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:45,090
- I'll come through what?
- There'll have to be an inquiry.

1020
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:48,800
- An inquiry?
- Those things, the public forgets.

1021
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,720
- Public?
- You've got to clear your name.

1022
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,220
You cannot allow such vile insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

1023
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:59,270
So that's it.

1024
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,390
You're making me the goat.

1025
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:05,480
The only completely innocent man
in this whole affair.

1026
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,360
I have only one last thing
to say to you, George.

1027
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:17,110
The man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier.

1028
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,500
Well...

1029
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,670
it had to be done.

1030
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:34,090
France cannot afford to have fools
guiding her military destiny.

1031
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:37,210
I'm grateful to you for having
brought this matter to my attention.

1032
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,720
Colonel, how would you like
General Mireau's job?

1033
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,890
- His what?
- His job.

1034
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,600
Let me get this straight, sir.

1035
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,480
You're offering me
General Mireau's command?

1036
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,400
Come, come, Colonel Dax.
Don't overdo the surprise.

1037
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,810
You've been after the job from
the start. We all know that, my boy.

1038
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,940
I may be many things, sir,
but I am not your boy.

1039
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:04,950
Well, I certainly didn't mean
to imply any biological relationship.

1040
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:07,070
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- Are you trying to provoke me, Colonel?

1041
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,280
- Why should I want to do that?
- Exactly. It would be a pity...

1042
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:11,120
to lose your promotion
before you get it.

1043
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:15,370
A promotion
you have so very carefully planned for.

1044
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,330
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

1045
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:24,840
Colonel, you will apologize at once
or shall be placed under arrest!

1046
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:29,970
I apologize
for not being entirely honest with you.

1047
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:33,850
I apologize
for not revealing my true feelings.

1048
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,100
I apologize
for not telling you sooner...

1049
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,140
that you're a degenerate,
sadistic old man.

1050
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:43,100
And you can go to hell before I
apologize to you now or ever again!

1051
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:49,900
Colonel Dax,
you're a disappointment to me.

1052
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,030
You've spoiled the keenness of your mind
by wallowing in sentimentality.

1053
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,160
You really did want
to save those men...

1054
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,030
and you were
not angling for Mireau's command.

1055
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,950
You're an idealist, and I pity you
as I would the village idiot.

1056
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,500
We're fighting a war,
a war that we've got to win.

1057
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,580
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

1058
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:12,040
You bring charges against General
Mireau, so I insist he answer them.

1059
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:14,300
Wherein have I done wrong?

1060
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:21,260
Because you don't know the answer
to that question...

1061
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,260
I pity you.

1062
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,330
Thank you.

1063
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:54,790
Now, gentlemen,
we have a special entertainment...

1064
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,290
for you.

1065
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,880
Sort of a--
sort of a little diversion, as it were.

1066
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:07,550
And my wife always says, "What is life
without a little diversion?"

1067
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:13,930
Now, gentlemen, I give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy.

1068
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,270
Boo!

1069
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:20,230
From Germany,
the land of the Hun!

1070
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:48,330
Gentlemen, a little pearl
washed ashore...

1071
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,840
by the tide of war.

1072
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,720
Hey, talk
in a civilized language!

1073
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,980
It's true.
The little lady has her limitations.

1074
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:10,310
As a matter of fact,
she has absolutely no talent at all...

1075
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:14,320
except, that is,
maybe a little natural talent.

1076
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,240
The little lady can't dance,
she can't tell any jokes...

1077
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,490
and she can't balance rubber balls
on her little nose.

1078
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:30,450
But she can sing like a bird!
She has a throat of gold.

1079
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,540
- Come on, baby!
- Come on, honey! Sing us a song!

1080
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,720
Louder!

1081
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,880
- Sir.
- Yes, sir?

1082
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,880
We have orders
to move back to the front immediately.

1083
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:17,220
- Give the men a few minutes more.
- Yes, sir.
