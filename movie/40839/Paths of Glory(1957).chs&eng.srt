“法国 1916年”

5
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:38,583
德国和法国之间的战争
War began between Germany and France

6
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:41,779
开始于1914年8月3日
on August 3, 1914.

7
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:44,687
5周后 德国军队已经突破到
Five weeks later, the German army had smashed its way...

8
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:47,225
离巴黎不到18英里的地方
to within 18 miles of Paris.

9
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:51,491
被打得灰头土脸的法军 却奇迹般地在马恩河集结
There, the battered French miraculously rallied their forces at the Marne River...

10
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:55,948
经过一系列出奇制胜的反击 把德国人赶了回去
and in a series of unexpected counterattacks ...  Detail, halt! Drove the Germans back.

11
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,436
前线稳固了
The front was stabilized...

12
00:01:58,504 --> 00:02:02,308
不久后形成了一条高度设防、没有缝隙的战壕
then shortly afterwards developed into a continuous line... of heavily fortified trenches...

13
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,674
曲曲折折绵延500英里
zigzagging their way 500 miles...

14
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:08,236
从英吉利海峡一直到瑞士边境
from the English Channel to the Swiss frontier.

15
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:12,216
到了1916年 经过两年惨烈的的堑壕战
By 1916, after two grisly years of trench warfare...

16
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:15,482
战线几乎没有改变
the battle lines had changed very little.

17
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:19,116
有效的攻击都是数百码外的
Successful attacks were measured in hundreds of yards...

18
00:02:19,192 --> 00:02:22,252
数十万士兵因此丧生
and paid for in lives by hundreds of thousands.

19
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:27,064
Broulard将军到了 长官
General Broulard, sir.

20
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,533
你好啊 George
Hello, George. How are you?

21
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:32,435
Paul 再次见到你太好了 真是太好了
Paul, wonderful seeing you again. Really wonderful.

22
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:35,406
你这真是金碧辉煌啊 是第一流的
Well, this is splendid. It's superb.

23
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:38,205
气派 非常气派
It's grand, very grand.

24
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:40,939
我是试着让工作环境舒服点
Well, I've tried to create a pleasant atmosphere in which to work.

25
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:45,385
那你干的不错啊 看看这些地毯和绘画 我希望能有你这样好的品味
Well, you've succeeded marvelously. I wish I had your taste in carpets. - Oh! - And pictures.

26
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:48,621
你过奖了 George 过奖了 坐吧
You're much too kind, George. Much too kind.Sit down, George. 

27
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,555
- 谢谢  - 其实我没有改动多少
- Thankyou.I really haven't done very much.

28
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:54,059
我刚搬来的时候差不多就是这样
The place is much the same as it was when I moved in.

29
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:58,887
Paul 我这次来是关于一件大事的
Paul, I've come to see you about something big.

30
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:02,196
这是最高机密 不能轻易告诉下属
It's top secret and must go no further than your chief of staff...

31
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:04,634
除非他的谨慎值得你信任
and not to him unless you can trust his discretion.

32
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:05,932
当然
Of course.

33
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:09,441
为了即将展开的进攻 这条战线上正在集结一批部队
A group of armies is forming on this front for an offensive very soon.

34
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,909
总部决心来一个彻底的突破
Headquarters is determined to make a complete breakthrough.

35
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:14,276
- 你笑什么？ - 很抱歉
- Why are you smiling? - I'm really sorry.

36
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:17,783
刚刚有一瞬间 我想我知道你要说什么 请继续说吧
I thought for just a moment I knew what you were going to say. Please go on.

37
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,284
我从不知道你会读心术 你认为我要说什么？
I never knew you were a mind reader. What did you think I was about to say?

38
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:24,584
- 跟Ant Hill有关  - 你确实会读心术
- Something about the "Anthill  - You are a mind reader.

39
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:26,591
好吧 这是一处要塞 又在我的防区内
Well, it is a key position. It's in my sector.

40
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,501
完全坦白地讲 我听到了一些传言
To be perfectly honest, I've heard some talk.

41
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,897
- 你知道 总部没有真正的秘密的  - 你怎么看？
You know, there's nothing really secret around headquarters.- Well, what do you think?

42
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,992
就整个德军在本防区的布防来看 这处要塞是关键
It's the key to the whole German position in this sector.

43
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,038
他们已经守了一年了
They've held on to it for a year now...

44
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,573
看起来 只要他们愿意 再守一年也没问题
and it looks as though they'll hold on to it for another year if they want to.

45
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,269
Paul 我接到正式命令 最晚在10号 必须拿下Ant Hill
Paul, I have formal orders to take the Ant hill no later than the 10th.

46
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:48,006
就是后天  - 这几乎称得上可笑 你不觉得吗？
That's the day after tomorrow. - That comes pretty close to being ridiculous, don't you think?

47
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:51,642
如果我真这样想的话 我就不会来这了
I don't imagine I'd be here if I really thought that.

48
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:56,246
Paul 如果在军中有人能为我做这件事 那这个人就是你
Paul, if there's one man in this army who can do this for me, it's you.

49
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,288
不可能 绝对不可能
It's out of the question, George. Absolutely out of the question.

50
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,384
我的师被打得七零八落
My division was cut to pieces.

51
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:05,989
剩下的部队处于不利形势 想守住防线都有困难 更不可能攻下Ant Hill
What's left of it is in no position to even hold the Ant hill, let alone take it.

52
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:09,193
很抱歉 但这是事实
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

53
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,533
好吧 我还要告诉你一些别的事情
Well, Paul, there was something else I wanted to tell you.

54
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:15,665
但是我敢肯定你会误解我的动机
However, I'm sure that you'll misunderstand my motives in mentioning it.

55
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:20,406
- 是什么事？ - 噢 你一定会误解的
- What was it? - Oh. You'd be bound to misunderstand.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,972
但是 作为朋友 也许我应该告诉你
However, as your friend, maybe I should tell you.

57
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,432
你想说什么？
What are you trying to say, George?

58
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,485
Paul 总部传出流言 正在考虑让你统领第12军
Paul, talk around headquarters is that you are being considered for the 12th Corps.

59
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:33,320
- 第12军？ - 是的 再加一颗星（代表职衔的星章）
- The 12th Corps? - Yes, and with that, another star.

60
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,326
我已尽我所能 推动此事
Now, I've pushed it all I can.

61
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:38,625
第12军需要一位能打仗的将军 你早就该得到这颗星了
The 12th Corps needs a fighting general, and you're overdue on that star.

62
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,859
咱俩都明白 你的履历足够优秀
Now, we both know that your record is good enough...

63
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,697
以至于你可以根据刚才所说的理由 拒绝这项任务
for you to refuse this assignment on the grounds you've stated.

64
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,329
没有人会质疑你的观点 他们只会去另找他人执行这个任务
No one would question your opinion. They'd simply get someone else to do the job.

65
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:52,367
所以 你不应该让这些影响你的观点 Paul
So you shouldn't let this influence your opinion, Paul.

66
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:57,038
噢 抱歉 来杯科尼亚克白兰地? - 不 谢谢 Paul 晚饭前我不喝
Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac? - No, thanks, Paul, not before dinner.

67
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:05,183
George 我要为8千名士兵的生命负责
George, I'm responsible for the lives of 8,000 men.

68
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,989
与之相比 我的抱负算什么？
What is my ambition against that?

69
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,360
与之相比 我的名誉算什么？
What is my reputation in comparison to that?

70
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,899
我的士兵是第一位的 George
My men come first of all, George,

71
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,492
他们也清楚这一点 - 我知道
...and those men know it too  - I know that they do.

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,664
你看 George 他们知道我绝不会让他们失望的
You see, George, those men know that I would never let them down.

73
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,401
这是不言而喻的
That goes without saying.

74
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,255
对我而言 一名士兵的生命 比法国所有职衔、奖章和荣誉更有意义
The life of one of those soldiers means more to me...
than all the stars and decorations and honors in France.

75
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:30,945
所以 你觉得
So...you think

76
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:34,350
你的军队目前的战斗力 不足以发起这次进攻？
this attack is absolutely beyond the ability of your men at this time?

77
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,753
我没这么说 George
I didn't say that, George.

78
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,453
一旦这些士兵的战斗欲望被燃起 没有什么做不到的
Nothing is beyond those men, once their fighting spirit is aroused.

79
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,087
Paul 如果你觉得这次进攻计划不明智 我不想强迫你
Paul, I don't want to push you into it if you think it's ill-advised.

80
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:47,621
别担心 George 你试试就知道 你不可能强迫我
Don't worry, George. You couldn't do that ifyou tried.

81
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:52,368
当然 如果有炮火支援将会完全不一样
Of course, artillery would make an enormous difference.

82
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:55,635
你能给我提供什么样的炮火支援？ - 唔 我会去弄清楚的
What artillery support can you give me? - Well, I'll see.

83
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,767
增援呢？ - 我们会尽力
What about replacements? - We'll see what we can do

84
00:05:57,844 --> 00:06:01,075
但是我确信 你能用你手头的部队完成任务
but I feel sure that you can get along with what you have.

85
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,081
也许刚刚好能完成 噢 Paul 
- Might just do it. -Oh, Paul.

86
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,743
我就知道来找你是对的 你就是拿下Ant Hill的人
I knew that I was right to come to you. You are the man to take the Ant hill.

87
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:11,078
至于那颗星……- 那与我的决定无关！
Now, as far as that star is concerned ... - That had nothing to do with my decision.

88
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,024
如果有关 它会使我做出相反的决定
If anything, it would sway me the other way.

89
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,957
我完全明白 Paul
I realize that perfectly, Paul.

90
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,961
对了 你说要什么时候攻下它？
Now, when do you say you see this coming off?

91
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,130
不迟于后天 - 我们或许能做到！
No later than the day after tomorrow. We just might do it.

92
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:46,322
你好 士兵 准备好多杀些德国人了吗？
Hello there, soldier. Ready to kill more Germans?

93
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,326
是的 长官  - 你叫什么名字 士兵？
Yes, sir. - What's your name, soldier?

Sir, Private Ferol, Company "A." - Uh-huh. Are you married, Private?

95
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:54,127
没有 长官 - 那么 你母亲一定为你感到骄傲
No, sir.Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.

96
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,692
是的 长官- 好的 继续努力 士兵 祝你好运
Yes, sir - Well, carry on, Private, and good luck to you

Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

98
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:06,177
早上好 将军 - 早上好
Good morning, General  - Good morning.

99
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:08,179
你好 士兵 - 长官

Ready to kill more Germans? - Yes, sir.

101
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,383
啊哈 我看见你在擦拭你的步枪
Aha! Working over your rifle, I see.

102
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,976
好 就该这样做 步枪是士兵最好的朋友
Well, that's the way. It's a soldier's best friend.

103
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,284
你对它好 它会永远对你好
You be good to it, and it'll always be good to you.

104
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,290
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:24,019
好吧 祝你好运 士兵
Well, uh, good luck to you, soldier.

106
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,030
继续努力吧 - 谢谢 长官
Carry on  - Thankyou, sir.

107
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:54,416
你好 士兵
Hello there, soldier.

108
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,961
准备好多杀些德国人了吗？
Ready to kill more Germans?

109
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,157
一切都好吗 士兵？
Well, is everything all right, soldier?

110
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:03,292
一切都好 是的 长官 我很好
All right? Yes, sir, I'm all right.

111
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,836
啊哈 好样的
Aha. Good fellow.

112
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:09,898
你结婚了吗 士兵？ - 结婚？我 结婚了吗？
Are you married, soldier? - Married? Me, married?

113
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:13,537
是的 你有妻子吗？ - 妻子？我有妻子吗？
Yes. Have you got a wife? - A wife? Have I got a wife?

114
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,842
长官 他有点炮弹休克症
Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

115
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:21,251
你说什么 中士 世上就不存在炮弹休克症
I beg your pardon, Sergeant. There is no such thing as shell shock.

116
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,753
你有妻子吗 士兵？ 我的妻子？
Have you got a wife, soldier? - My wife?

117
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:27,418

118
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,427
我再也见不到她了 我会死在战场上
I'm never gonna see her again. I'm gonna be killed.

119
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,963
振作点！你就像一个胆小鬼！
Get a grip on yourself! You're acting like a coward!

120
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:34,499
我是个胆小鬼 长官 - 振作起来 士兵！
I am a coward, sir. - Snap out of it, soldier!

121
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:38,663
中士 我要你立即把这小婴儿调离我的团！
Sergeant, I want you to arrange for the immediate transfer of this baby out of my regiment!

122
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:41,400
我不希望其他的勇士被他感染
I won't have other brave men contaminated by him!

123
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:43,806
遵命 长官 - 继续努力 中士
Yes, sir. - Carry on, Sergeant.

124
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:51,075
你是对的 长官 如果没有查出来 这种情绪会传染的
You were right, sir. This sort of thing can spread if it isn't checked.

125
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,277
将军 我相信你的巡视
You know, General, I'm convinced that these tours of yours...

126
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,946
能极大提升这些士兵的士气
have an incalculable effect upon the morale of these men.

127
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,957
我想701团的战斗精神正是来源于此
In fact, I think the fighting spirit of the 701 st derives from it.

128
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:02,859
不 少校 那来源于他们自己
No, no, Major. That spirit was just born in them.

129
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,698
将军来了 长官
The general is coming, sir.

130
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,150
见到你我总是很高兴 上校 - 荣幸之至 将军
Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel. - I'm honored, General.

131
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,211
这完全是我们的荣幸
It's our privilege entirely.

132
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:33,281
嗯 你这儿真是小而整洁
Well, quite a neat little spot you have here. - Colonel.

133
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:37,090
整洁谈不上 长官 不过确实够小的
I reserve comment on the neatness, sir, but it is little.

134
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,461
不好意思 太寒碜了 请坐吧
Pretty shy on seating accommodations though.

135
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:42,831
对我来说足够了 我没有坐的习惯
More than enough for me. I never got the habit of sitting.

136
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:45,632
我喜欢站着 时刻处于机动状态
Like to be on my feet. Keep on the move.

137
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:50,631
这我可以担保 上校 签署命令的时候 
我都没办法让将军在桌子后面多坐一会儿
I can vouch for that, Colonel. I can hardly get the general behind a desk long enough to sign an order.

138
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,803
这就是我的方式 你知道的 Dax
Well, that's the way I am, you know, Dax.

139
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:55,813
我搞不懂那些坐在扶手椅上 想从桌子后面发动进攻的军官
I can't understand these armchair officers...fellows trying to fight a war from behind a desk

140
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,977
向敌人挥舞着文件
waving papers at the enemy...

141
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:03,249
担心着会不会有老鼠钻进他们的裤腿
worrying about whether a mouse is going to run up their pants leg.

142
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:05,624
我不知道 将军 如果能从老鼠和枪子之间选 我每次都会选老鼠
I don't know, General. If I had the choice between mice
and Mausers... I think I'd take the mice every time.

143
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:09,986
我才不信呢,上校
You'll never make me believe that, Colonel.

144
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:12,587
认真的说 如果是个傻子
Seriously though, if a man's a ninny...

145
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,293
那就让他穿上礼服 藏在床下吧
let him put on a dress and hide under the bed.

146
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,336
但如果他想成为一名士兵 他就必须做士兵该做的
But if he wants to be a soldier, then, by heavens, he's got to be one.

147
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:21,579
他必须战斗 而他只有待在战场上才能战斗
He's got to fight, and he can't do that unless he's where the fighting is.

148
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,478
这是我的信条 - 我想我只能赞同你
That's my credo. I think I have to agree with you,

149
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:27,412
你说的太让人信服了 长官
presenting your case so convincingly, sir.

150
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,683
你从来都不会让我们对你的期待落空 - 我觉得你肯定想看看周围情况 不是吗？
And you've never failed to live up to it, sir. - I imagine you'd like a look around, wouldn't you?

151
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:32,412
是的 上校
Yes, Colonel.

152
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:34,301
看看这个 Ant Hill
Well, here's something to see.

153
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,789
这是最佳视角了 除非我们占领那里
The Anthill. About as good a view as you can get without actually being there.

154
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:40,621
呵呵 指日可待了 不是吗？
Well, that won't be long now, will it?

155
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,358
啊
Ah.

156
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,699
嗯
Ah. Yeah.

157
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,464
嗯 我看到更多难以攻克的目标
Well, I've seen much more formidable objectives.

158
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,529
比之前还要困难许多啊
Much, much worse.

159
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:03,441
嗯 虽然不是我们唾手可得之物
Well, not something we can grab and run away with...

160
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:05,643
但肯定是可以被攻破的（“可被攻破的”发音与“怀孕”相似）
but certainly pregnable.

161
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:08,585
虽然听起来有点怪 不是吗？- 为什么？
Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it? - Why?

162
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:10,918
呵呵 说得跟生孩子一样
Well, like something to do with giving birth.

163
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,426
哦 是的 不错 你今天早晨很机灵啊 上校
Oh, yes. Quite. You're right on your toes this morning, Colonel.

164
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,927
甚至比以往更机敏 但我们绝不会忘记
Even sharper than usual.But we mustn't forget,

165
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:20,124
上校也许是全法国最好的刑事律师
the colonel was perhaps the foremost criminal lawyer in all France.

166
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,033
当然了 将军 - 先生们 你们太客气了
Of course, General. - Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

167
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:27,436
告诉我 上校 你们昨晚换防的情况如何？
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief come off last night?

168
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:30,532
我们遭到了一些炮击 29人伤亡 长官
We drew some artillery. Twenty-nine casualties, sir.

169
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:34,670
是的 我在来的路上注意到了 绝对不可原谅 真蠢
Yes, I noticed it on the road in. Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

170
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:37,910
所有人如同一群苍蝇般挤在一起 等着被人拍死
All swarmed together like a bunch of flies, just waiting for someone to swat 'em.

171
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,783
似乎他们从来不吸取教训 
Well, they never learn, it seems.

172
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:44,511
在狭窄的地方 猛烈的炮火之下 每次还都挤在一起 
They get in a tight spot under heavy fire, gang up every time.

173
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,327
我想这是畜牲的本能 - 某种低等动物的本能 
Herd instinct, I suppose. Kind of a lower-animal sort of thing.

174
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,295
我看是某种人类的本能 你分不清这两者的区别吗 少校？
Kind of a human sort of thing, it seems to me...
or don't you make a distinction between the two, Major?

175
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:53,024
噢 是的 呃 非常不幸 当然
Oh, yes, uh, very regrettable, of course. Very. Yes, indeed.

176
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:57,592
非常 是的 非常   少校 你能回避一下吗？
Uh, Major, would you be kind enough to excuse us for a few minutes?

177
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,763
遵命 长官 当然可以
Yes, sir. Of course.

178
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,272
上校
Colonel.

179
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,541
好吧 上校 你认为怎么样？
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

180
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,550
我认为什么怎么样 长官？
Ant Hill - What do I think of what, sir? - The Anthill.

181
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:17,555
上校 你们团明天要攻下Ant Hill
Colonel, your regiment is going to take the Anthill tomorrow.

182
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:21,393
你知道我们的情况 长官 - 噢 当然 一些士兵将不得不牺牲
You know the condition of my men, sir. Oh, naturally, men are going to have to be killed.

183
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:24,794
可能会牺牲很多 一些士兵将会吃枪子和弹片……
Possibly a lot of them.They absorb bullets and shrapnel...

184
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,229
所以其他人才有可能突破过去
and by doing so make it possible for others to get through.

185
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,564
有什么支援？ - 什么都没有
What support will we have? - I have none to give you.

186
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,395
你预计伤亡情况将会是什么样的 长官？
What sort of casualties do you anticipate, sir?

187
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:39,258
这么说吧 5%会死在自己人的火力网下 这比通常能够接受的伤亡数字大很多
Hmm, say, five percent killed by our own barrage. That's a very generous allowance.

188
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,644
10%能突破到无人地带
Ten percent more in getting through no-man's-land...

189
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:43,978
20%能突破到铁丝网
and 20% more getting through the wire.

190
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:47,951
还剩下65%的士兵 去完成最艰难的部分
That leaves 65% with the worst part of the job over.

191
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,013
假设25%的士兵实际占领了Ant Hill
Let's say another 25% in actually taking the Anthill.

192
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,117
那也足够守住它了
We're still left with a force more than adequate to hold it.

193
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:58,095
将军 你是说超过一半的士兵将会战死
General, you're saying that more than half of my men will be killed.

194
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,927
是的 可怕的代价 上校
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel...

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,471
但是 我们将占领Ant Hill  - 但是我们能吗 长官？
but we will have the Anthill  - But will we, sir?

196
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:10,033
我全靠你了 上校 整个法国就全靠你了
I'm depending on you, Colonel.All France is depending on you.

197
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:15,113
你觉得我在开玩笑吗 上校？
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

198
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:19,781
我不是公牛 将军 我不需要面前挥舞的旗帜来激发我的斗志
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need a flag waved in front of me to get me to charge.

199
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:22,821
我不喜欢你把法国国旗比作斗牛士的斗篷
I don't think I like your comparison of the flag of France to a bullfighter's cape.

200
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,049
我没有不尊重法国国旗的意思 长官
I meant nothing disrespectful to the flag of France, sir.

201
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:28,651
爱国主义也许过时了 但爱国者是真诚的
Patriotism may be old-fashioned, but show me a patriot, and I'll show you an honest man.

202
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:32,564
不是每个人都一直这么想 Samuel Johnson对爱国主义发表过不同看法
Not everyone has always thought so. Samuel Johnson had something else to say about patriotism.

203
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:33,997
我可以问一下是什么看法吗？
And what was that, may I ask?

204
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,996
其实没什么 - “其实没什么”是什么意思？
Nothing really. - What you do mean, "Nothing really"?

205
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,540
拜托 长官 这并不重要 - 上校 我问你的问题 都是重要的
Come on, sir, nothing really important.- Colonel, when I ask a question, it's always important.

206
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,100
这人叫什么？Samuel Johnson（18世纪英国著名作家 批评家） 长官
Now, who was this man? - Samuel Johnson, sir.

207
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,872
好的 他对爱国主义怎么看？
All right. Now, what did he have to say about patriotism?

208
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:49,245
他说那是无赖的最后一处庇护所 长官
He said it was the last refuge of a scoundrel, sir.

209
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,274
对不起 我不是针对个人
I'm sorry. I meant nothing personal.

210
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:55,582
你累了 Dax 你很累了
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

211
00:13:55,654 --> 00:14:00,046
是你已经筋疲力尽了 而不是你的士兵 是我的失误 
我接二连三地给你艰巨的任务
It's you who are exhausted, not your men.And it's my fault. 
I've given you one impossible task after another.

212
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,225
你需要休息 非常需要- 我没有说过要休息 长官 
You need rest. You need it badly - I haven't said anything about needing rest, sir.

213
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:07,458
你也绝不会说出来那么 你将不会谈论任何有关休息的事了 上校
And you never would either. Therefore, you're not going to have any say-so about it, Colonel.

214
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:10,229
因为从现在开始 我下令给你放个无限期的长假
As from right now, I'm ordering you on indefinite furlough.

215
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:12,896
将军 你不能把我和我的士兵分开 你不能这样对我 长官！
General, you can't take me away from my men. You can't do that to me, sir.

216
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:16,600
不是对你 Dax 是为了你 为了你和你的士兵们好
Not to you, Dax. For you. For your good and for the good of your men.

217
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:18,609
为我的士兵好 长官？
The good of my men, sir?

218
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:22,443
如果一个指挥官缺乏信心 我们还能指望他的士兵有信心吗？
If a commanding officer lacks confidence, what can we expect of his men?

219
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:26,644
当然 我不是想撤你的职 但我必须得到你热情的支持
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you, but I must have your enthusiastic support.

220
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:30,985
我需要你说你们可以拿下Ant Hill
Not once have you said that your men can take the Anthill.

221
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:35,955
我们会拿下Ant Hill
We'll take the Anthill.

222
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:39,429
如果世界上有士兵可以拿下……
If any soldiers in the world can take it...

223
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:41,864
那我们就能拿下Ant Hill
we'll take the Anthill.

224
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:45,267
成功之后 你的部队将会得到一个长假
And when you do, your men will be relieved and get a long rest.

225
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:03,248
下士Paris和二等兵Lejeune报告 长官
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune reporting, sir.

226
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:05,522
你们还真是磨磨蹭蹭啊
You took your time about it.

227
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:09,561
我们已经尽快准备了 长官 况且我们还要通知哨兵
We prepared as quick as we could, sir.We had to alert the sentries.

228
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:13,332
好吧 稍息 这是一次侦察任务
All right. You men, at ease. This is a reconnaissance patrol ...

229
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:17,236
德军的铁丝网 机枪位置 人数
German wire, machine gun posts... identification of bodies.

230
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:20,637
只有我们三个人 要尽量避免交火
There will only be the three of us, and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

231
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:27,008
我们从左边出去 然后从右边的6号据点回来
We go out to the left, and we come back through Post 6 on the right.

232
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,809
6号据点的情况如何？ - 所有哨兵都已通知到位
Is everything all clear at Post 6? - All the sentries have been warned up to here.

233
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:33,283
从4:00起 6号据点会每隔10分钟发射一次照明弹
Number 6 will send up flares at 10-minute intervals starting at 0400.

234
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:36,219
我希望是每隔5分钟 - 我告诉过他们了 长官
I wanted them every five minutes. - I told them that, sir.

235
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:39,655
那个中士说5分钟太频繁了 会招来炮击的
The sergeant says every five minutes is too much. He says it's certain to draw artillery.

236
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,784
这位中士是军事家吗？他叫什么名字？
Quite a strategist, this sergeant. What's his name?

237
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,226
我不知道 长官
I don't know, sir.

238
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,595
好的 你们在外面等着 我一会儿就来
All right. You men wait outside. I'll join you in a minute.

239
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,227
请问可以告诉我们行动密码吗 长官？
Would you mind telling us the password, sir?

240
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:53,771
Calais （也是法国一个城市的名称） - 是的 长官
Calais. - Yes, sir.

241
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:05,582
他在给自己壮胆 - 那酒闻起来很香啊
He's fortifying himself  - It smelled like heaven.

242
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:08,711
一看就知道喝了不少 说话这么刻薄
I can always tell when he's had a few. He gets sarcastic.

243
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,688
嗯 至少可以让兄弟们每人都喝点嘛 这个猪头
Well, at least he could have passed it around, the pig.

244
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:14,817
嘿 他怎么惹你了？
Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

245
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,487
战争爆发前 我们是同学
We went to school together before the war.

246
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:20,054
他觉得我不够尊重他 他说对了
He thinks I don't have enough respect for him. He's right.

247
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:24,769
你们准备好了吗？
If you gentlemen are ready.

248
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,812
上校  - 是的 长官 - 了解你们的任务了吗？
Colonel. - Everything clear and understood? Yes, sir.

249
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:36,212
通过我们铁丝网的通道就在这前面
The lane through our wire is right out in front here.

250
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,579
机枪都对着通道呢
Machine guns are pointing at the opening.

251
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,743
祝你们好运 - 谢谢 长官
Good luck, men  - Thank you, sir.

252
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:43,219
好的 我们出发
All right, men. Let's go.

253
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,068
那是什么？ - 我不知道
What's that? - I don't know.

254
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,504
Lejeune 过去看看 我们掩护你
Lejeune, move out and look that over. We'll cover you.

255
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:48,944
你要我们在夜间巡逻中分散开？
Split up a night patrol?

256
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:50,948
快去 Lejeune
Move out, Lejeune.

257
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,534
我不喜欢这儿 我们走吧
I don't like this. Let's get out of here.

258
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,797
我们要多等他一些时间
We haven't given him enough time.

259
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:28,671
我们继续等的话 也会被干掉的 - 我们应该等他
If we wait any longer, they'll get us too - We've got to wait for him.

260
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,218
他肯定死了 他在哪儿？
He must be dead. Where is he?

261
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,991
Roget！
Roget!

262
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,715
哇 - 惊讶吧 中尉？
Well  - Surprised, Lieutenant?

263
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:41,344
是的 很惊喜 我还以为你被打死了
Yes, I am. Happily surprised. I thought you'd been killed.

264
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,286
你没有等在那里确认一下 对吧 中尉？
You didn't wait around to find out, did you, Lieutenant?

265
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:45,846
你这么说 是什么意思？
Now, look here. What do you mean?

266
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:49,189
我是说你杀了Lejeune 然后像个兔子似的溜了
I mean, you ran like a rabbit after you killed Lejeune.

267
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:52,822
杀了Lejeune？你在说什么？
Killed Lejeune? What are you talking about?

268
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:55,366
我不喜欢你的语气
I don't think I like your tone.

269
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:57,697
记住 你正在和一位军官说话
You're speaking to an officer. Remember that.

270
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:01,000
噢 那肯定是我搞错了 长官
Oh, well, I must be mistaken then, sir.

271
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:03,597
一个军官不会做出这种事的
An officer wouldn't do that.

272
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:06,075
一个男人不会做出这种事的
A man wouldn't do it.

273
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:08,078
只有一种东西会
Only a thing would.

274
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:10,080
一只鬼鬼祟祟的 醉醺醺的 黄肚皮的老鼠 - 你……
A sneaky, booze-guzzling, yellow-bellied rat ...- Now ...

275
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,852
大脑被酒精麻痹 脊梁骨像唾沫一样……
够了 下士！- 你让自己陷入了麻烦当中 中尉？
with a bottle for a brain and a streak of spit where his spine ought to be.
That's enough, Corporal! - You've got yourself into a mess, Lieutenant.

276
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,674
噢 是吗？那么 你让自己陷入了更大的麻烦中
Oh, I have, have I? Well, you've got yourself in a worse one.

277
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:26,454
第一 不服从上级 第二 威胁你的上司
First, general insubordination. Second, threatening your superior officer.

278
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:30,831
第三 拒绝服从命令 并煽动其他人也这样做
Third, refusing to obey an order and inciting others to do the same.

279
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:33,462
你觉得这些指控写在报告里会怎样？
Now, how do you think those charges are gonna look on paper?

280
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:35,733
与下面这些相比不值一提
Not half as bad as these.

281
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,799
鲁莽行事让士兵身陷险境
Endangering the lives of your men through recklessness.

282
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:42,902
上岗时酗酒 蓄意杀死战友
Drunk on duty. Wanton murder of one of your own men

283
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:46,042
面对敌人时胆小如鼠
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

284
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:52,588
Phillip 你想指控一位军官吗？
Philippe, have you ever tried to bring charges against an officer?

285
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:57,529
你知道 是咱俩对质 你觉得他们会相信谁的话？
It's my word against yours, you know. And whose word do you think they're gonna believe?

286
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,588
或者换个说法
Or l-let me put it another way.

287
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,599
他们会接受谁的说法呢？
Whose word do you think they're going to accept?

288
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,158
现在 我告诉你我会怎么做
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

289
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:08,297
到目前为止 我在报告里写的是
So far, all I have written in this report...

290
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:11,900
你和Lejeune在侦察时牺牲了
is that you and Lejeune were killed while out on patrol.

291
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:14,172
我会改成 我们在交火中分散之后
I'll fix this to read that you made your way back...

292
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:16,544
你活着回来了
after becoming separated during the skirmish.

293
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:19,277
这样就一劳永逸地把事情解决了 - 你杀了Lejeune 你知道的 不是吗？
That'll end the matter once and for all - You killed Lejeune. You know that, don't you?

294
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:21,046
我很抱歉 那是一个意外 - 你投了手榴弹并且杀了他
I'm sorry. It was an accident - You threw that grenade and killed him.

295
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,782
事实上 如果这件事没有发生 我愿献出一切
I'd give anything in the world if it hadn't have happened, and that's the truth.

296
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:28,656
老实说 我知道你不喜欢我 但是你以为我是哪种人？
Honestly, I know you don't like me, but what kind of a man do you think I am?

297
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,827
噢 早上好 上校 - 稍息
Oh, good morning, Colonel.- At ease, men.

298
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,499
我一直在等你的报告 - 好的 我们有所发现
I've been waiting foryour report, Lieutenant  - Well, I think we found out a thing or two.

299
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:41,266
一切顺利吗？ - 不 长官 二等兵Lejeune牺牲了
Everything go well? - No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

300
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:43,466
怎么牺牲的？- 都写在这份报告里了 长官
How'd it happen? - It's all right here in the report, sir.

301
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,669
好的 给我吧 - 还没有写完 长官
Well, let's have it  - Oh, it isn't quite finished yet, sir.

302
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:48,804
就这样吧 下士 你干的不错
That's all, Corporal. You did a good night's work.

303
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,179
你应该感到自豪 去睡会儿吧
Should feel very proud of yourself. Go get some sleep.

304
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,683
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

305
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:01,387
怎么折了Lejeune的？- 机枪打死的 长官
How'd you lose Lejeune? - Machine gun fire, sir.

306
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:05,395
他咳嗽了 差点把我们也害死
He coughed. Almost got us all killed.

307
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:07,795
写完报告立刻交给我
Finish that report and get it to my dugout immediately.

308
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,299
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

309
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:18,072
炮击从5:15开始
The artillery starts at 0515.

310
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:22,136
一营5:30出发
First Battalion will move out at 0530.

311
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:24,408
当先头部队清除德军的铁丝网后…
When the leading elements have cleared the German wires...

312
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:27,280
二营和三营组成的第二梯队
the second wave, consisting of the Second and Third Battalions ...

313
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:30,788
除去留下2个连作后备 全都出发
minus two companies in reserve ... will move out...

314
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:34,814
不能迟于5:40
in no case later than 0540.

315
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:37,691
就这样 先生们 有什么问题吗？
Well, that's it, gentlemen. Are there any questions?

316
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:42,028
长官 15分钟炮击是我们仅有的支援吗？
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery preparation all that we can expect?

317
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,594
是的 感觉他们要组织更多炮击需要花太多时间
The feeling is that any more than that will give them too much time to get organized.

318
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,866
明天天气如何 长官？
What's weather supposed to be like tomorrow, sir?

319
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,040
非常好
Too good.

320
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:55,073
没有雨或者雾吗？
No chance of rain or fog?

321
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:57,614
预报说整天都是晴天
The forecast is for sun all day.

322
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:02,085
“如果”――或者我该说“当”我们拿下Ant Hill
lf, uh ... Perhaps I should say when we take the Anthill...

323
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:05,122
我们要坚守多久才能得到增援？
how long do we have to hold it before we can expect any support?

324
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:09,619
对了 顺便说一句 Mireau将军 将亲自监督这次进攻
Well, General Mireau, who, by the way, will be personally observing the attack...

325
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:12,561
他承诺72团将在明天日落时增援
has promised us support from the 72nd by sundown tomorrow...

326
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,828
意思是 当然 我们要坚守一整天
which means, of course, that we'll have to hold all day.

327
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:19,328
还有什么问题吗？
Are there any more questions?

328
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:27,272
好吧 先生们 祝你们好运 我肯定你们会像往常一样胜利的
Well, gentlemen, good luck, and I'm sure you'll come through as you always do.

329
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:29,040
去睡会吧
Let's get some sleep.

330
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:34,276
我并不害怕死在明天 我只是害怕被杀
[Man Whispering] I'm not afraid of dying tomorrow, only of getting killed.

331
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:37,355
听不懂你的话 - 你更能接受那种死法？
That's as clear as mud  - Which would you rather be done in by,

332
00:25:37,355 --> 00:25:40,125
刺刀还是机枪？- 当然是机枪
a bayonet or a machine gun? - Oh, a machine gun, naturally.

333
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,891
当然了 这就是我想说的 它们都是用钢铁扎破你的肚子
Naturally. That's just my point.They're both pieces of steel ripping into your guts.

334
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,760
只不过机枪更快 更干净 痛苦更少 不是吗？
Only the machine gun is quicker, cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

335
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:48,662
这又说明什么？ - 这说明我们大多数人
What does that prove? - That proves that most of us

336
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,896
怕受伤更甚过于怕死亡
are more afraid of getting hurt than of getting killed.

337
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,304
看看Bernard 他最怕毒气 而我一点也不怕
Look at Bernard. He panics when it comes to gas, but gas doesn't bother me a bit.

338
00:25:56,374 --> 00:25:59,935
他看到过被毒死的照片 而我没有见过
He's seen photos of gas cases. Doesn't mean anything to me.

339
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:03,344
但是我告诉你 我最怕头上没有钢盔 怕得要死
But I'll tell you something though ... I'd hate like the devil to be without my tin hat.

340
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:06,009
但另一方面 我屁股上有没有钢盔我无所谓
But on the other hand, I don't mind not having a tin hat for my tail.

341
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,450
为什么？- 你应该这样 头部是大脑所在
- Why's that? - You ought to. That's where your brains are.

342
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,954
因为我知道头上的伤势会比屁股上的严重得多
Because I know a wound to the head will hurt much more than one in the tail.

343
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:14,082
屁股上就是肉 可头上……头上可全都是骨头
The tail is just meat, but the head ... ah, the head is all bone.

344
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,491
随你怎么说 - 告诉我
Ah, speak for yourself - Tell me this.

345
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:19,086
除了刺刀 你最害怕什么？
Aside from the bayonet, what are you most afraid of?

346
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:21,428
烈性炸药 - 没错 和我一样
High explosives  - Exactly! And it's the same with me.

347
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:24,434
因为……因为我知道那会把你炸成碎片
Because ... Because I know that it can chew you up worse than anything else.

348
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:27,096
你看 就像我告诉你的 如果你真的害怕死亡
Look, it's just like I'm trying to tell you.If you're really afraid of dying,

349
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,197
你下半辈子将一直活在恐惧中
you'd be living in a funk all the rest of your life...

350
00:26:29,274 --> 00:26:31,504
因为你知道你迟早有一天会死 任何一天都可能
because you know you've got to go someday, any day.

351
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:33,861
此外 如果死亡是你真正的害怕的东西 那为什么在乎是什么杀了你？
And besides, if it's death that you're really afraid of...
why should you care about what it is that kills you?

352
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:40,709
啊 你太聪明了 教授 我只知道没有人想死
Ah, you're too smart for me, Professor. All I know is nobody wants to die.

353
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:52,524
师部通讯畅通 长官 直通Polygon
Through to Division, sir. Through to Polygon.

354
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:56,499
一切平静 各单位都报告准备好了
Everything quiet. All units report themselves ready.

355
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:59,196
倒计时2分钟
Zero-minus two.

356
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,204
先生们 来点科尼亚克白兰地？
May I offer you gentlemen some cognac?

357
00:27:01,272 --> 00:27:02,705
谢谢 将军 - 谢谢 长官
Thank you, General  - Thank you, sir.

358
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:08,445
你先 长官
Afteryou, sir. 

359
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:11,581
为法国干杯

364
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:09,807
中士 B连在哪？
Sergeant, where's "B" Company?

365
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:11,815
我不知道 长官
I don't know, sir.

366
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:18,681
看在上帝的份上 他们在哪？- 在左翼 长官
Where in heaven's name are they? - On the left, sir.

367
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:21,926
其余的在哪？已经1分钟了 而他们还在战壕里
Where are the rest? Zero-plus one, and they're still in the trenches. They're not advancing.

368
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:25,692
他们没有前进 可怜的胆小鬼！他们没有前进！
Yes, sir - Miserable cowards. They're not advancing!

369
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:28,755
炮击点已经离他们很远了！可他们还在战壕里！
The barrage is getting away from them! They're still in the trenches!

370
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,266
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

371
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:33,262
Nichols上尉
Captain Nichols.

372
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:34,804
是的 长官？
Yes, sir?

373
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:38,705
命令75团准备炮击我们自己的阵地
Order the 75s to commence firing on our own positions.

374
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:44,671
上尉 你听不懂我的命令吗？
Captain, do you fail to comprehend the meaning of my order?

375
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:47,149
不 长官 但是我请您……
No, sir, but I respectfully ask to ...

376
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:50,483
上尉 你听不懂我的命令吗？
Captain, do you fail to comprehend the meaning of my order?

377
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:51,487
不 长官
No, sir.

378
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:55,681
那就发命令吧 上尉  - 遵命 长官
Then carry it out, Captain  - Yes, sir.

379
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,360
你好 Polygon 这里是师部
Hello, Polygon. This is Division.

380
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:07,370
炮兵1营和2营准备攻击
Batteries 1 and 2 commence firing...

381
00:33:07,438 --> 00:33:12,432
坐标 32-58-78
on coordinates 32-58-78.

382
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,104
炮兵1营和2营准备攻击
Batteries 1 and 2 to commence firing...

383
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:20,207
坐标 32-58-78 完毕
on coordinates 32-58-78. Over.

384
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:31,725
将军 炮兵指挥官报告说 那是自己的阵地
General, the battery commander reports those are our own positions.

385
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:33,388
他说一定是搞错了
He says it must be a mistake.

386
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:38,803
确认命令 上尉  - 遵命 长官 没有错误 确认命令
Confirm the order, Captain  - Yes, sir. There is no mistake. The order is confirmed.

387
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:42,705
炮兵指挥官报告说他不能执行这样的命令
Battery commander respectfully reports he cannot execute such an order...

388
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,436
除非是手写的并且有将军的签名 完毕
unless it is in writing and signed by the general. Over.

389
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:50,743
炮兵指挥官报告说他不能执行这样的命令
General, battery commander respectfully reports he cannot execute such an order...

390
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:53,010
除非是手写的并且有将军的签名
unless it is in writing and signed by the general.

391
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:55,143
把电话给我 - 遵命 长官
Give me that phone! - Yes, sir.

392
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:01,055
我是Mireau将军
General Mireau speaking!

393
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,922
我是炮兵指挥官 长官
Battery commander speaking, sir.

394
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:07,532
该部队反叛 拒绝前进 向他们开炮 直到有新的指示！
The troops are mutinying, refusing to advance. Fire as ordered until further notice!

395
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:11,366
尊敬的长官 你没有权利命令我向自己人开炮
With all respect, sir, you have no right to order me to shoot down my own men...

396
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:14,962
除非你愿意独自承担一切责任
unless you are willing to take full and undivided responsibility for it.

397
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,507
Rousseau上尉 你执行命令吗？
Captain Rousseau, are you going to obey my order?

398
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:21,204
我必须接到手写的命令 长官
I must have a written order before I can execute such a command, sir.

399
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:23,645
假如你牺牲了呢？那我会怎么样？
Supposing you're killed. Then where will I be?

400
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:27,241
你会在明天早上被枪毙！
You'll be in front of a firing squad tomorrow morning! That's where you'll be!

401
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:31,778
交出你的指挥权 向我的总部报告 你已经被逮捕了
Hand over your command and report yourself under arrest to my headquarters!

402
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:45,596
Roget！
Roget!

403
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:50,007
Roget中尉 为什么你的人还在这里？ - 不可能了 长官 Vignon少校死了
Lieutenant Roget! Why are your men still in here? - It was impossible, sir. Major Vignon is dead.

404
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,168
让这些人冲出战壕！
Get these men out ofthe trenches! Come on!

405
00:34:52,243 --> 00:34:57,146
来吧！让我们再试一次！让这些人冲出去！
Let's get ready for another try! Get these men out of here!

406
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:59,478
我试了三次了！伤亡严重啊
I've tried three times. Look at all the casualties.

407
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:04,602
好吧 让我们再试一次！来吧！再来一次
All right! Let's give it another try! Come on! Let's give it another try!

408
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:18,891
不可能的 长官 所有的人都在撤退了
It's impossible, sir. All the men are falling back.

409
00:35:20,104 --> 00:35:24,507
长官 我服从上校的命令
Sir, I respectfully submit to the colonel ...

410
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:29,205
但请原谅 你的命令对我很不公平 长官
Pardon, your remarks to me were very unfair, sir.

411
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,977
就是不可能办到嘛 就是不可能
It's just impossible! It's just impossible.

412
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,747
将军 根据第一批报告 进攻已经全线失败
General, according to first reports, the attack has failed all along the line.

413
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:39,415
士兵们都在撤回战壕
The men are falling back to our own trenches.

414
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,291
Saint-Auban少校 安排701团立即换防
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for the immediate relief of the 701 st Regiment.

415
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:48,230
送他们到Aigle城堡 让Dax上校到我的总部报道
Have them sent to the Chateau d'Aigle. Have Colonel Dax report to my headquarters.

416
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:51,427
遵命 长官 - Gouderc少校 召集一个军事法庭
Yes, sir  - Major Couderc, assemble a general court-martial.

417
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:54,062
明天下午3:00准备好
Have it ready to meet at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

418
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:58,097
这些娘们儿不愿意吃德国的子弹 就让他们尝尝法国的吧！
If those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones!

419
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:12,957
我下令进攻 而你的部队拒绝进攻
I ordered an attack. Your troops refused to attack.

420
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:15,448
我的部队的确进攻了 长官 但是他们攻不上去
Our troops did attack, sir, but they could make no headway.

421
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:20,131
那是因为他们没有努力 上校  我亲眼见到的 半数人根本就没离开战壕
Because they didn't try, Colonel. I saw it myself. Half of your men never left the trenches.

422
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:23,032
三分之一的人都被强火力压制住了
A third of my men were pinned down because the fire was so intense.

423
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,517
不要争论细节了 上校
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

424
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,602
事实是 你的人有相当一部分 根本没有离开自己的战壕
The fact remains that a good part ofyour men never left their own trenches.

425
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:33,371
Dax上校 我要你们团每个连出10个人
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men from each company in your regiment...

426
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:36,208
尝尝因为怯懦而判死刑的滋味
tried under penalty of death for cowardice.

427
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,874
死刑？- 因为怯懦！
Penalty of death? - For cowardice!

428
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:41,179
他们血管中流淌的不是血液 而是脱脂牛奶
They have skimmed milk in their veins instead of blood.

429
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:44,153
这恐怕是我见过最红的牛奶了！我的战壕被红色脱脂牛奶浸透了！
Then it's the reddest milk I've ever seen. My trenches are soaked with that red skimmed milk.

430
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:47,384
够了！- 我要直言不讳的说…
That's just about enough out of you, Colonel! - I'm not gonna mince words and stand on protocol ...

431
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,052
Dax上校 如果你的态度一直如此 我将被迫把你逮捕
Colonel Dax, if you continue in this manner, I shall have to place you under arrest.

432
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,790
我认为 上校有他的道理 尽管他过于直率了
I believe the colonel has a point, even though he makes it rather bluntly.

433
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:56,492
这不是审判 但从某些方面来看是的
This is not a trial, but it does bear certain aspects of one.

434
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:59,968
Dax上校是在做辩护
And Colonel Dax, technically, is cast in the role of the defense.

435
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:02,369
从指控的严肃性这一角度来看 法庭将会给予最大的宽容
In view of the gravity of the charges a court of law would grant
him all possible latitude in presenting his case.

436
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:07,972
宽容是一回事 不服从命令是另一回事
Latitude is one thing. Insubordination another.

437
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:10,104
我只是提供一个建议 将军
I am merely offering an opinion, General.

438
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:12,274
请不要勉强接受
Please do not feel constrained to accept it.

439
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:16,217
我非常乐意接受 Broulard将军
I am perfectly willing to accept it, General Broulard.

440
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:20,018
对不起 长官 我绝对没有不服从命令的意思
I'm sorry, sir. I certainly didn't intend to be insubordinate.

441
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:23,060
我唯一的目的是想提醒你 在过去的每一次战斗中
My only aim is to remind you of the heroism these men have shown...

442
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:25,186
这些士兵所展现出来的英雄气概
on every occasion in the past.

443
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:28,163
我们不是在谈论过去 我们是在谈论现在
We're not talking about the past. We're talking about the present.

444
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:30,723
但是你没看见吗 长官？他们不是胆小鬼
But don't you see, sir? They're not cowards.

445
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,964
如果一些士兵没有离开战壕 这命令一定是不可行的
So if some of them didn't leave the trenches, it must have been because it was impossible.

446
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:38,600
他们接到命令去进攻 服从命令是他们的天职
They were ordered to attack. It was their duty to obey that order.

447
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:41,577
还轮不到这些士兵来判断命令是否可行
We can't leave it up to the men to decide when an order is possible or not.

448
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:44,679
如果命令是不可行的 那唯一的证明就是
If it was impossible, the only proof of that...

449
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,250
他们躺在战壕内的尸体
would be their dead bodies lying at the bottom ofthe trenches.

450
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,344
他们是败类 上校
They're scum, Colonel.

451
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:55,126
整个烂团就是一群 偷偷摸摸的、哀怨的、拖着尾巴的杂种狗
The whole rotten regiment ... a pack of sneaking, whining, tail-dragging curs.

452
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:56,559
你真的相信是这样吗 长官？
Do you really believe that, sir?

453
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:59,926
是的 这正是我相信的
Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

454
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:02,966
更糟的是 这是一个不争的事实
And what's more, it's an incontestable fact.

455
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,196
那为什么不把全团都毙了 我是认真的
Then why not shoot the entire regiment? I'm perfectly serious.

456
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,037
你完全搞错了 我们并不想屠杀整个法军
Now, Colonel, you're missing the point entirely.
We don't want to slaughter the French army. 

457
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,742
我们要的是杀鸡儆猴
All we want to do is to set an example.

458
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,142
噢 如果这是你想要的 那就杀我吧
Oh, well, if it's an example you want, then take me.

459
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,646
你？ - 是的 长官 如果你想要杀鸡儆猴
Take you? - Yes, sir, if it's an example you want...

460
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:19,342
1个人和100个人是一样的
one man will do as well as a hundred.

461
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:23,910
从逻辑上说 军官应该为这次进攻负最大的责任
The logical choice is the officer most responsible for the attack.

462
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:27,086
行了 上校 我看你是过度紧张了
Come now, Colonel. I thinkyou're overwrought.

463
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:29,786
这不是军官的问题
This is not a question of officers.

464
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,988
Paul 我们不想做得太过分
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

465
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,690
只拿12个人如何
Suppose we just make it a dozen.

466
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,936
我刚才说100个人 你现在一下减到了12个
I was talking of a hundred men, and now we're down to 12.

467
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:41,336
Paul 我们不要再争这个了
Paul, let's not haggle over this thing anymore!

468
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,465
让我们一劳永逸地把这事定下来吧 这样我们都能在这个阴影中继续生活
Let's get it settled once and for all so that we can all live with it.

469
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,613
好吧 也许我太急于见到罪有应得了
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious to see proper justice meted out.

470
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:53,775
我一生都贡献给了军队
I've spent my entire life in the army.

471
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:56,251
我一直试图忠于自己的原则
I've always tried to be true to my principles.

472
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,256
这是我唯一可以被指责的错误
That's the only mistake I can ever be accused of.

473
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:02,451
这样定吧
I'll settle for this ...

474
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:07,122
先从一营每个连中 由连长选出一个人来
have the company commanders select one man from each company in the first wave...

475
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:10,201
共3个 - 好 非常合理 Paul
three in all  - Well, that's very reasonable of you, Paul.

476
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:14,035
军事法庭将于下午3:00在城堡开庭
The court-martial will meet at the chateau at 3:00 this afternoon.

477
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,732
这个时间你方便吗？ - 我不会去的 Paul
Will that be convenient for you, General? - I won't be there, Paul.

478
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,206
你不会去？
You won't be there?

479
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,709
是的 我想最好是你自己来处理这个事情
No, I think it best that you handle this matter on your own.

480
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:22,746
也许是吧
Probably so.

481
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:24,612
Mireau将军
General Mireau.

482
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,657
如果可能的话 我愿意做被告的辩护律师
If it's at all possible, I'd like to be appointed counsel for the accused.

483
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,414
我会考虑的
I'll take the matter into consideration.

484
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:33,388
我想我们可以允许 不是吗 Paul？我们当然可以
I think we can permit that, can't we, Paul?  Of course we can.

485
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,481
就这么定了 上校 - 谢谢你 长官
Consider it settled, Colonel  - Thank you, sir.

486
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:40,264
中午了 Paul 我希望你能留下吃午饭 上校
Well, noon straight up, Paul. I hope that you can stay for lunch, Colonel.

487
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:43,324
George 恐怕上校没有空
George, I'm afraid the colonel won't have time.

488
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,267
不要否认 Paul 你一直藏着这个人
Don't deny it, Paul. You've been hiding this man, keeping him for your own.

489
00:39:46,337 --> 00:39:48,805
总是为你所用 太自私啦
I think that was very selfish of you.

490
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:53,071
谢谢你 将军 但是恐怕很快就要3:00了
Thank you for your courtesy, General, but I'm afraid there isn't much time between now and 3:00.

491
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:57,079
好吧 上校 我会期待下次再见到你
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward to the pleasure of seeing you again.

492
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:19,799
上尉 什么事？ - 你叫我来这儿向你报告 长官
Yes, Captain? What is it? - You ordered me to report to you here, sir.

493
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,930
Rousseau上尉 炮兵指挥官  - 是的 是的 当然
Captain Rousseau, battery commander, sir  - Yes, yes, of course.

494
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:26,841
我想和你谈谈 关于一些炮弹落点很近的事
I wanted to speak to you about some of your shells falling short.

495
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:31,215
我现在没有时间 回去向你的上级报告 等待进一步的命令
I haven't time to go into it now. Report back to your command until further orders.

496
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,648
遵命 长官
Yes, sir

497
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:38,284
差劲的部下 使得士气都低落了 - 非常同意你的看法
Bad stuff. Demoralizes the men  - I quite agree with you.

498
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:41,017
最好的解决办法是搁置不用 把他调离
And the best solution is to shelve him to another outfit.

499
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:43,150
军事调查委员会应该先严厉批评他一下
A court of inquiry ought to roast him a bit first.

500
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:47,798
嗯 像炮弹落点很近这种事 我……我总是避免展开调查
Well, in cases like this ... shells falling short ... I ... I always try to avoid an inquiry.

501
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:51,234
那会给士兵们留下一个坏印象
It gets around among the men and makes a bad impression.

502
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:53,600
我看 搁置将会是对他最合适的惩罚
No, shelving will be the best discipline for him, in my opinion.

503
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:56,640
好吧 也许你说得对  - 哦 失陪一会可以吗？
Well, perhaps you're right  - Oh, uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

504
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,641
团里有件事情我想跟上校谈谈
A regimental matter I want to mention to the colonel.

505
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,075
那就餐厅见  - 好的 马上就来
I'll join you in the dining room  - Splendid. In a moment.

506
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,678
Sancy上尉、Renouart上尉和Roget中尉
That will be Captain Sancy, Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

507
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:08,616
遵命 长官  - 让他们一个半小时之内到团部来见我
Yes, sir  - Have them meet me at regimental headquarters in half an hour.

508
00:41:08,686 --> 00:41:10,620
遵命 长官  - Dax上校
Yes, sir  - Colonel Dax.

509
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,517
是的 长官  - 我想跟你谈谈
Yes, sir  - I'd like a word with you.

510
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:16,957
当然 长官
Certainly, sir.

511
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:21,699
我们都明智一点吧  - 明智 长官？
Let's be sensible about this  - Sensible, sir?

512
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:26,650
听我说 Dax 别跟我油腔滑调 明白吗？
Listen to me, Dax. Drop this fancy talk with me, understand?

513
00:41:26,704 --> 00:41:30,538
Broulard将军似乎觉得你很风趣 我不觉得
General Broulard seems to think you're funny. I don't.

514
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:34,839
我要你别再理会这件事  - 你说什么 长官 这是个命令吗？
Now, I want you to drop this affair  - I beg your pardon, sir. Is that an order?

515
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:38,712
Dax上校 这件麻烦事结束之后 我会修理你的
Colonel Dax, when this mess is cleaned up, I'll break you.

516
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:40,773
我会找个借口降你的职
I'll find an excuse and I'll break you to the ranks. I'll ruin you.

517
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:43,787
我会毁了你 你对你的指挥官不忠心
And it'll be just what you deserve...

518
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:47,348
这是你应得的
showing such little loyalty to your commanding officer.

519
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,483
就这些 上校
That's all, Colonel.

520
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,279
立――定！
Detail, halt!

521
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:15,376
Mireau将军认为 昨天早晨对Ant Hill的进攻
General Mireau feels that the attack on the Anthill yesterday morning failed...

522
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:19,149
由于一营的部分士兵不够努力而失败了
because of an inadequate effort on the part of the First Battalion.

523
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:21,623
你们每个人从你们连选出一个人来
Each of you is to select one man from your company...

524
00:42:21,692 --> 00:42:25,423
逮捕他们 并且带他们到军事法庭
place him under arrest and have him ready to appear before a general court-martial...

525
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:28,192
不得迟于今天下午15:00
no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.

526
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:30,597
指控罪名是 面对敌人时怯懦
The charge is cowardice in the face of the enemy.

527
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,659
这是给你们的命令 先生们 去执行吧
You have your orders, gentlemen. Let's carry them out.

528
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:55,991
但是Roget中尉侦察时杀了Lejeune
But Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune on that patrol...

529
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,460
还威胁我对整件事情保密！
and then blackmailed me into keeping quiet about the whole thing!

530
00:42:58,529 --> 00:43:01,089
所以他才会选我！ - 下士 我理解你的感受
That's why he picked me  - Corporal, I understand your feelings.

531
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:03,861
但这件事与你将面临的指控没有关系
But that story has nothing to do with the charges you're being tried for.

532
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:06,801
你不相信我吗 长官？- 我相信
Don't you believe me, sir? - Yes, I do,

533
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,587
但是别人会信吗？你又没有证人
but who else will? You've got no witnesses.

534
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:14,509
况且 这种对军官的指控只会惹怒法庭
Besides, such charges against an officer would only antagonize the court.

535
00:43:14,578 --> 00:43:18,105
这件事完了之后 我会再来调查那次侦察的
When we get clear of this, I'm going into the story of that patrol again.

536
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:22,084
长官 在我们连 Renouart上尉用抽签的方法来选
Sir, in my case, Captain Renouart had the sergeant draw lots.

537
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:24,279
我被选中纯属偶然
I was picked purely by chance.

538
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:26,822
你是幸运的 看着我
You're lucky. Look at me.

539
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,384
我被选中是因为 Sancy上尉说我不受欢迎
I was just picked because Captain Sancy said I was a social undesirable.

540
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:33,726
我 一个不受欢迎的人 上校
Me, a social undesirable, Colonel.

541
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:36,425
我表现得一点也不怯懦 被抽签选中！这公平吗？- 我也不怯懦！Vignon少校……
I didn't act like a coward. Picking by lots ... is that fair?- Neither did I! Major Vignon ...

542
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,626
先生们！
Gentlemen!

543
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:40,431
你们得明白 你们被选中的原因不重要
You've all got to understand that the reason you were picked is immaterial.

544
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:44,497
无论什么原因 你们将接受生死攸关的审判
Whatever the reason, you're on trial for your lives.

545
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:53,149
坚持你们刚才的说法 不要被检察官所动摇
Stick to the stories you've told me... and don't let the prosecutor shake you out of them.

546
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:56,709
记住 你们是士兵 在场的都是上级军官
Now remember, you'll be soldiers in the presence of superior officers.

547
00:43:56,787 --> 00:43:58,721
你们的表现要与你们的身份相符
So act like what you are ...

548
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:00,586
士兵
soldiers.

549
00:44:00,657 --> 00:44:03,148
勇敢的士兵
And brave ones at that.

550
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:06,697
我去过那审判厅 午后的阳光会照在你们脸上
Now, I've been in the room you'll be sitting in. The afternoon sun will be in your faces...

551
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:11,031
所以别一副垂头丧气的样子
so don't let it seem as if you're dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

552
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,701
回答问题的时候 直视法官的眼睛
When you answer questions, look the judges in the eye.

553
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:17,706
不要抱怨、申辩或滔滔不绝 那是我的任务
Don't whine, plead or make speeches. That's my job.

554
00:44:17,774 --> 00:44:19,765
简单的陈述 简短
Simple statements ... short...

555
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:21,834
但是要让审判厅里的每个人都听到
but make them so they can be heard all over the room.

556
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:25,905
尽量不要重复说过的话 我会为你们总结的
And try not to repeat yourselves. I'll do that for you when I sum up.

557
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,290
时间不多了 大约还有1小时就开庭了
Now, we haven't much time. The court-martial begins in about an hour, and I've got notes to look at.

558
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,419
我还要看看笔记

559
00:44:32,356 --> 00:44:34,551
祝你们好运
Good luck.

560
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,559
谢谢你 上校
Thank you, sir - Colonel, sir.

561
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,767
向左――转！
On the left, ho!

562
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,689
立――定！
Detail, halt!

563
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,570
向左――转！
On the left, ho!

564
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,079
向左――转！
On the left, ho!

565
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,626
左转！
Left face!

566
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:20,236
本军事法庭开庭 被告入座
The court-martial is open. The prisoners may be seated.

567
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:32,583
这是一个普通军事法庭 所以我们应该免除不必要的环节
This is a general court-martial. We shall therefore dispense with unnecessary formalities.

568
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:36,178
这些人被控在敌人面前表现怯懦
These men are charged with cowardice in the face of the enemy...

569
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:38,687
将因此而接受审判
and will be tried for that offense.

570
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:40,017
检察官先生
Mr. Prosecutor.

571
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,355
传被告 二等兵Ferol
Call the accused ... Private Ferol.

572
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:45,535
主席先生
Mr. President.

573
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,413
检察官询问当事人时 连起诉书都不读吗？
Will the prosecutor question the witnesses without even reading the indictment?

574
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:52,994
请不要纠缠这些技术细节 浪费庭审时间
Please don't take up the court's time with technicalities.

575
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,870
起诉书那么长 看它有何用
The indictment is lengthy, and there's no point in reading it.

576
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,500
辩护方有权知道确切的被控罪名…… - 起诉书说的是
The defense has a right to know the exact accusations ...

577
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:02,204
在进攻Ant Hill的过程中
The indictment is that the accused showed cowardice in the face of the enemy...

578
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:04,440
被告在敌人面前表现怯懦
during the attack on the Anthill.

579
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:07,483
继续 检察官先生
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

580
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:10,315
传被告 二等兵Ferol
Call the accused ... Private Ferol.

581
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:23,166
二等兵Ferol  - 是的 长官？
Private Ferol  - Yes, sir?

582
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:26,293
当时你在攻击Ant Hill的第一梯队？
Were you in the first wave during the attack on the Anthill?

583
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,743
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

584
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,675
你拒绝前进？  - 没有 长官
Did you refuse to advance?  - No, sir.

585
00:46:31,675 --> 00:46:34,769
那你前进了？  - 是的 长官
Did you advance?  - Yes, sir.

586
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,403
你前进了多远？
How far did you advance?

587
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,746
大概到无人地带中部
To about the middle of no-man's-land, sir.

588
00:46:40,817 --> 00:46:44,221
然后你做了什么？  - 到处都是机枪射出的子弹
Then what did you do? There were machine-gun bullets landing all around.

589
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,815
回答问题 你做了什么？
Answer the question. What did you do?

590
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,259
好吧 我看到了Meyer 他也在那儿……
Well, I saw that me and Meyer, sir ...

591
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:53,489
我没问你看到什么
I didn't ask you what you saw.

592
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:57,590
法庭不关心你的……“视觉经历”
The court has no concern with your... visual experiences.

593
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:01,001
我的什么 长官？  - 回答问题
My what, sir?  - Prisoner will reply to the question.

594
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:02,800
遵命 长官 问题是什么？
Yes, sir. What question was it?

595
00:47:02,873 --> 00:47:06,809
你前进到了无人地带中部 然后你做了什么？
You advanced to the middle of no-man's-land. What did you do then?

596
00:47:06,877 --> 00:47:09,573
然后 长官？  - 你后退了还是前进了？
Then, sir?  - Did you go back or forward?

597
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:11,496
后退 长官
I went back, sir.

598
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:16,374
换句话说 二等兵Ferol 你撤退了
In other words, Private Ferol, you retreated.

599
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:18,887
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

600
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:22,618
我问完了 被告可以回到座位上了
That's all. The accused may return to his seat.

601
00:47:22,693 --> 00:47:23,955
等一等
Just a minute.

602
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:28,657
主席先生 如果可以 我想问当事人几个问题
Mr. President, I'd like to question the witness if I may.

603
00:47:28,732 --> 00:47:30,393
问吧 上校  - 谢谢
Proceed, Colonel - Thank you.

604
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:35,339
二等兵Ferol 当你达到无人地带中部
Now, Private Ferol, when you reached the middle of no-man's-land...

605
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,307
就只有你和二等兵Meyer吗？
were you alone with Private Meyer?

606
00:47:37,374 --> 00:47:38,568
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

607
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:40,872
那么 你们连其他人上哪去了？
Well, what happened to the rest of your company?

608
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:45,445
我不知道 长官 我想也许其他人都阵亡了或受伤了
Well, I don't know, sir. I guess the rest of them had been killed or wounded.

609
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:49,442
你发现你和二等兵Meyer两人 在无人地带中间 处于孤立无援的状态？
And you found yourself in the middle of no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

610
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,786
是的 长官  - 你们为什么不独自进攻？
Yes, sir - Why didn't you attack the Anthill single-handed?

611
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,827
为什么你们不独自强行进攻Ant Hill？
Why didn't you storm the Anthill alone?

612
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:02,091
就我和Meyer？你开玩笑吧 长官
Just me and Meyer? You're kidding, sir.

613
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:07,504
是的 我是在开玩笑 二等兵Ferol 谢谢你 我问完了
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol. Thank you. That's all.

614
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:10,234
我不懂你的问题是何意
I don't see the point of this line of questioning.

615
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,682
我是想指出
Well, I'm attempting to indicate, sir...

616
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:17,304
检察官的问题完全是荒谬的
the utter absurdity of the line of questioning used by the prosecutor.

617
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,780
检察官先生
Mr. Prosecutor.

618
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:23,286
那么 二等兵Ferol 你坦率地承认 你撤退了？
So you freely admit, Private Ferol, that you retreated.

619
00:48:23,353 --> 00:48:26,117
是的 长官 我和Meyer两个人
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

620
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:30,319
我知道我们应该拿下Ant Hill 但是我们撤退了
I knew we should've took Anthill, but we came on back.

621
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:34,660
没有问题了
[Dax] That's all.

622
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,957
被告人可以回到座位上了
The accused may return to his seat.

623
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:52,442
二等兵Arnaud 你前进了吗？
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

624
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:57,283
是的 长官 直到Renouart上尉命令撤回战壕
Yes, sir, until I was ordered back to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

625
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:59,447
你前进了多远？
How far did you advance?

626
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,457
到铁丝网 长官
Into the wire, sir.

627
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:05,325
我想 是敌军的铁丝网
The, uh, enemy wire, I suppose.

628
00:49:05,395 --> 00:49:07,329
不 长官 是我军的铁丝网
No, sir. It was our wire.

629
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:14,135
你的意思是你连我军的铁丝网都没有过？
You mean to tell me that you didn't advance any further than our wire?

630
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,172
没有 长官
No, sir, I didn't.

631
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:20,977
你说那有多远？有多少米？
How far would you say that was? How many meters?

632
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:23,639
这个 我已经尽力最远了
Well, I advanced as far as I could.

633
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,908
多少米？
How many meters?

634
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,214
没多少米
Not many.

635
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:32,121
没多少米？
"Not many."

636
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:36,749
好吧 二等兵Arnaud
Now, Private Arnaud,

637
00:49:36,827 --> 00:49:40,228
在你接到撤退命令之前
before you were ordered back...

638
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:42,663
你督促你的战友前进了吗？
did you urge your fellow soldiers forward?

639
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:47,666
大多数刚跨出战壕就被打死或打伤了
Most of them were dead or wounded before they got three steps beyond the trenches.

640
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:49,102
回答问题
Reply to the question.

641
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:51,766
我没有督促他们 没有 长官
I didn't urge them on. No, sir.

642
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:56,912
谢谢
Thank you.

643
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:08,004
二等兵Arnaud 请稍息
Private Arnaud ... At ease, please.

644
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:13,425
你除了没能竭力激励战友外
Aside from your sad failure to give throat to spirited battle cries

645
00:50:13,497 --> 00:50:15,465
你的行为 从任何方面来说
was your behavior different in any respect from that

646
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:17,397
和连里的其他战友有区别吗？
of the other men in your company?

647
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:19,298
反对 这只是个猜测
Objection. That's a matter of conjecture.

648
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:21,564
反对有效
Sustained.

649
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,474
你们连有人超过我军的铁丝网吗？
Did any men in your company get beyond our wire?

650
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:28,909
没有 长官
No, sir.

651
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:31,379
我听说你被指定为懦夫
Is it true that you've been designated a coward...

652
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:34,076
仅仅是因为你抽出来一张标有“X”的纸片 是这样吗？
simply and purely because you drew a slip of paper marked "X"?

653
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,082
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

654
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:37,244
我不觉得这有什么大不了
I don't see that that's significant.

655
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,154
在法军中这种抽签的方式是可以接受的
It's accepted practice in the French army to pick examples by lot.

656
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:43,749
既然整个连都只前进了几米
And since this entire company advanced only a few meters...

657
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:46,796
抽签来选已是相当公平的了
picking by lot was eminently fair in this case.

658
00:50:46,863 --> 00:50:49,661
那么 我想要指出这名士兵
Well, I'd like to point out that this soldier has distinguished himself...

659
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:53,100
已经在几场最惨烈的战斗中证明了自己的优秀
in some of the bloodiest battles of the war.

660
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:55,219
如果法庭允许 我读一下
With the court's permission...

661
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:59,673
他因作战英勇而两次获得的嘉奖令
I'll read citations for bravery that he's already earned on two occasions.

662
00:50:59,743 --> 00:51:03,474
第一次 作战英勇嘉奖令……
First, citations in the Orders in the Army for bravery ...

663
00:51:03,547 --> 00:51:07,063
这无关紧要 被告受审是因为他最近的怯懦
That's immaterial, Colonel. The accused is not being tried for his former bravery...

664
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:09,074
而不是以前的英勇
but for his recent cowardice.

665
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:11,484
奖章不能用来辩护
Medals are no defense.

666
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,324
我可以传唤证明他品质的证人吗？
May I call witnesses to his character?

667
00:51:16,393 --> 00:51:18,190
不可以
You may not.

668
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:21,924
但是你可以传唤证明他到达德军铁丝网的证人
But you may call witnesses to the effect that he reached the German wire.

669
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,602
主席先生 整个团没有一个人
Mr. President, no one in the entire regiment...

670
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,867
达到德军铁丝网附近 包括我自己
got anywhere near the German wire, including myself.

671
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,767
如果你问完了 上校
Call the next accused...

672
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:35,072
传下一被告吧
if you're through, Colonel.

673
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,636
谢谢
Thank you.

674
00:51:37,747 --> 00:51:40,978
被告可以回到座位上了
Prisoner may return to his seat.

675
00:51:48,258 --> 00:51:52,193
你甚至从来没有离开战壕？
[Prosecutor] So you never even left the trenches.

676
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,528
是的 长官  - 我问完了
No, sir  - That's all.

677
00:51:56,333 --> 00:52:00,599
Paris下士 你为什么不离开战壕？
Corporal Paris, why didn't you leave the trenches?

678
00:52:02,005 --> 00:52:05,964
Vignon少校被击中了 他倒下时砸在我的头上 长官 把我砸晕了
Major Vignon was shot, and he fell back on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

679
00:52:06,076 --> 00:52:09,842
你在整个进攻过程中一直是昏迷的？
And were you lying unconscious in the trenches during the entire attack?

680
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:11,681
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

681
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:16,424
我问完了 - 有证人吗？
That's all - Have you any witnesses to that?

682
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:19,839
没有 所有人都忙成一团 没人注意到我 而且地上有很多尸体
No, sir. I guess everybody was too busy to notice me.
And there were so many others lying dead anyway.

683
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:26,384
但你没有证人？ - 没有 长官
But you have no witnesses  - No, sir.

684
00:52:26,496 --> 00:52:29,363
我只有头上的一个大伤疤 长官
I only have a rather large cut on my head, sir.

685
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:31,627
那可能是你后来自己弄的
That could have been self-inflicted later.

686
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:36,200
谢谢你 你可以回去了
Thank you. You may stand down.

687
00:52:41,778 --> 00:52:44,246
检察官先生 你可以陈词了
Mr. Prosecutor, you can make your plea now.

688
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,650
尊敬的各位法官
Gentlemen of the court...

689
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:55,657
这案子已无需多说
this case speaks for itself.

690
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:59,661
所有人都目睹了昨天早晨那次不幸的进攻
All of us witnessed the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

691
00:53:02,232 --> 00:53:06,635
我认为这次进攻
And I submit that that attack...

692
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:10,139
是法国国旗上的污点
was a stain on the flag of France...

693
00:53:10,206 --> 00:53:12,504
是法国
a blot on the honor...

694
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,942
每个男人、女人和孩子的荣耀上的污点
of every man, woman and child in the French nation.

695
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:21,646
对我们而言 这次任务是一次
It is to us that the sad, distressing...

696
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:27,620
令人沮丧、痛心、厌恶的失败 法官们
repellant duty falls, gentlemen.

697
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:30,752
我请求法庭
I ask this court to

698
00:53:30,827 --> 00:53:33,796
判被告有罪
find the accused guilty...

699
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:41,460
并且根据军事法处以刑罚
and impose the penalties prescribed by the Code of Military Justice.

700
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,276
谢谢 检察官
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

701
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:50,879
上校 你想陈词吗？
Colonel, would you like to make your plea?

702
00:54:01,024 --> 00:54:03,458
尊敬的各位法官
Gentlemen of the court, there are times when I'm ashamed...

703
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:07,724
我有时羞于作为人类的一员 现在这种情形就是如此
to be a member of the human race... and this is one such occasion.

704
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:13,560
要我为辩护方做总结陈词是不可能的
It's impossible for me to summarize the case for the defense...

705
00:54:13,636 --> 00:54:17,299
因为 法庭根本没有给我一个公平的机会来陈述
since the court never allowed me a reasonable opportunity to present my case.

706
00:54:17,373 --> 00:54:20,308
你在抗议这次庭审的真实、可靠性？
Are you protesting the authenticity of this court?

707
00:54:23,113 --> 00:54:24,978
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

708
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:28,017
我抗议 我被阻止出示
I protest against being prevented from introducing evidence...

709
00:54:28,084 --> 00:54:31,542
我认为对辩方至关重要的证据
that I consider vital to the defense.

710
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:33,485
控方没有任何证人
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

711
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,892
根本就没有一个书面的起诉书
There has never been a written indictment of charges made against the defendants.

714
00:54:38,962 --> 00:54:42,659
最后 我要抗议
And lastly, I protest against the fact...

715
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:45,701
这次审判没有速记记录
that no stenographic records of this trial have been kept.

716
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:59,375
昨天早晨的攻击 不是法国荣耀的污点
The attack yesterday morning was no stain on the honor of France...

717
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,251
当然也不是法国军人的耻辱
and certainly no disgrace to the fighting men of this nation.

718
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:06,101
但是 这个军事法庭
But this court-martial is

719
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:09,520
才是国家荣耀的污点和法国军人的耻辱
such a stain and such a disgrace.

720
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:13,551
对这些人的审判 是对人类正义的嘲弄
The case made against these men is a mockery of all human justice.

721
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:16,162
各位法官
Gentlemen of the court...

722
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:19,316
判决这些人有罪 将会成为你们的罪行
to find these men guilty...would be a crime to haunt each of you

723
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:25,571
会困扰你们终生 至死方休
... till the day you die.

724
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:33,843
我不敢相信 人类最崇高的情感冲动
I can't believe that the noblest impulse of man ...

725
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:37,978
即对他人的同情心 在这里竟然荡然无存
his compassion for another... can be completely dead here.

726
00:55:39,322 --> 00:55:42,257
因此 我谦逊地恳求你们
Therefore, I humbly beg you...

727
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:46,923
宽恕这些人吧
show mercy to these men.

728
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,234
把被告押送回警卫室
The accused will be escorted back to the guardroom.

729
00:55:55,305 --> 00:55:59,943
听证会结束 法庭现在休庭审议
The hearing is closed. The court will now retire to deliberate.

730
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:01,911
卫兵将会是六个人一组 全副武装
There will be a guard of six men under arms ...

731
00:56:01,978 --> 00:56:05,414
步枪上膛 刺刀就位 两人带一个犯人
rifles loaded, bayonets fixed ... two men to each prisoner.

732
00:56:05,481 --> 00:56:07,813
有任何风吹草动 立即把枪对准罪犯
Any sign of trouble, the prisoners will be instantly covered.

733
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:11,820
如果混乱没有马上平息 就把犯人就地处死
And if the trouble doesn't subside at once, the prisoner will be shot on the spot.

734
00:56:11,921 --> 00:56:15,357
一切都要顺利且迅速
Everything must go off without a hitch with the least possible delay...

735
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,329
但也不能操之过急 绝对不能四处乱走
but it shouldn't be hurried. There must be no fumbling around.

736
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:22,526
我是负责人
I've been put in charge and made personally responsible...

737
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:25,591
我对任何混乱和差错负责
for any lack of order or for any mistakes.

738
00:56:25,702 --> 00:56:30,765
但是如果你们任何人失职的话
But you can take it from me that I shall pass on any blame ... and with interest ...

739
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:34,571
他将替我承担责任
to any one of you who fails in his duties.

740
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:37,477
根据军事法庭的裁决
Execution will take place

741
00:56:37,547 --> 00:56:40,482
死刑将会在7:00执行
at 7:00 according to the verdict of the court-martial.

742
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:44,984
立正！注意！解散！
Detail, attention! Dismissed!

743
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:01,793
这是Mireau将军所赐  
This is compliments of General Mireau.

744
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:05,421
鸭子！- 替我谢谢他 - 噢 不要怪我 士兵
Duck.  - Well, tell him thanks - Oh, don't blame me, soldier.

745
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:08,405
嘿 丑人 我们用什么吃？手吗？
Hey, ugly, what are we supposed to eat this with ... our fingers?

746
00:57:08,478 --> 00:57:12,244
卫兵说不能让你们拿刀叉
The guard says you can't have any knives or forks.

747
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:14,476
这可能是我们最后一餐了吗？
Is this supposed to be our last meal or something?

748
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,509
不是“可能” 这肯定就是我们最后一餐了
It isn't "supposed to be" our last meal. It is our last meal.

749
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:20,816
这鸭子真好吃
Hey, this duck is terrific.

750
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:23,324
你觉得他们会在食物里下毒吗？
You suppose they put anything in the food?

751
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:25,861
先毒死我们 再枪毙我们？
First they poison us, then they shoot us?

752
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:32,702
我认为他们在里面下了药 - 放了什么？
I think they put something in it. Like what?

753
00:57:32,702 --> 00:57:36,832
比如……比如能让我们昏昏沉沉之类的东西
Like, uh ... Like something or make us groggy or something.

754
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,101
他们如果这么做了 也无可厚非
What would be wrong with that if they did?

755
00:57:39,175 --> 00:57:42,702
也许对你来说无所谓 但是我无论如何要出去
Maybe nothing for you, but I'm gonna get out of this somehow...

756
00:57:42,812 --> 00:57:44,503
我不想被下药  - 你要怎么出去？ 在石墙上啃出一条路吗？
and I don't wanna be drugged,How are you gonna get out ... chew your way through that stone wall?

757
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:51,921
Arnaud Dax上校 他会帮我们的
Colonel Dax, he'll-he'll ... he'll see us through.

758
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:56,921
听着 我们得出去 否则几小时之内他们就会杀了我们
Listen, we gotta get out of here. They're gonna kill us in a few hours if we don't.

759
00:57:56,993 --> 00:58:00,554
你有办法吗？- 没有 但肯定有办法的
Have you got an idea?- No, but there's gotta be a way.

760
00:58:01,864 --> 00:58:04,526
你觉得外面有多少人在看守？
How many guards you think they've got out there?

761
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,364
可能会有几个警卫 今天早上听起来是这样的
They may have a couple of squads. That's what it sounded like this morning.

762
00:58:07,437 --> 00:58:10,736
也许他们是我们的朋友  - 那些人是三营的
Maybe they're some of our friends  - That's the Third Battalion.

763
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:14,140
不管怎样 现在我们已经没有朋友了
Anyway, right now, we have no friends.

764
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:17,179
为什么要欺骗自己？我们出不去的
Why kid yourself? We're not gonna get out of this.

765
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,239
也许你出不去 但是我能出去 我向你保证
Maybe you're not, but I am. I'll guarantee you of that.

766
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:24,553
看到那只蟑螂了吗？
You see that cockroach?

767
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,817
明天早上 我们会死掉 而它会活着
Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

768
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,950
比起我 它跟我妻子和孩子的联系更紧密
It'll have more contact with my wife and child than I will.

769
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:34,996
我什么都不是了 而它会活着
I'll be nothing, and it'll be alive

770
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:38,033
现在你比它强啦
Now you got the edge on 'im.

771
00:58:42,472 --> 00:58:45,305
晚上好 我的孩子们 我是Dupree神父
Good evening, my sons. I'm Father Dupree.

772
00:58:48,478 --> 00:58:53,316
有什么消息吗？ - 恐怕我带来的是很坏的消息
Is there any news? - Yes. I'm afraid I bring you very bad news.

773
00:58:53,316 --> 00:58:56,149
Dax上校要我告诉你们 要做好最坏的打算
You must prepare yourselves for the worst. Colonel Dax asked me to tell you so.

774
00:58:56,219 --> 00:58:58,921
噢 仁慈的上帝 不！- 他已经跟总部通过电话
Oh, mercy! No! - He's been in telephone contact with army headquarters...

775
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:04,394
但无法找到Broulard将军 或其他有权利过问这件事的人
but unable to speak to General Broulard or, for that matter, to anyone in authority.

776
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:07,761
师部也是一样 都躲着不接电话
Same way at Division. No one wants to be found.

777
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,594
我们还有多少时间？ - 还有很多时间
How much time do we have? - You have plenty of time yet.

778
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,930
足够你们做好准备
Certainly more than enough to prepare yourselves.

779
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,010
以圣父圣子
In nomine Patris... In the name of the Father ...

780
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,388
圣灵之名
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

781
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,224
阿门
Amen.

782
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:32,077
神父 可以帮我寄这封信吗？
Father, will you take this letter for me, please?

783
00:59:32,188 --> 00:59:34,156
当然 我的孩子  - 是写给我妻子的
Of course, my son  - It's to my wife.

784
00:59:34,223 --> 00:59:37,317
她不会明白的 我已经尽力解释了
She won't understand this, and I tried to explain it to her.

785
00:59:37,393 --> 00:59:39,327
我保证她会明白的
I'll see that she gets it.

786
00:59:39,395 --> 00:59:42,296
你需要我倾听你的忏悔吗？
Do you want me to hear your confession?

787
00:59:42,365 --> 00:59:46,802
神父 事实上 我不是很信教
Well, Father, to tell you the truth, I'm not very religious.

788
00:59:46,903 --> 00:59:49,371
我知道你想帮我 我很感激
I know you're trying to help, and I appreciate it...

789
00:59:49,439 --> 00:59:52,431
但是如果我现在祷告 我会觉得自己很虚伪
but if I started praying now, I'd feel like a hypocrite.

790
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,476
噢 你错了 孩子
Oh, that's an error, my son.

791
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:57,672
上帝随时都愿意听你的祷告
God is always ready to listen to your prayers.

792
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:06,115
好吧 神父 你现在愿意听我忏悔吗？- 是的
All right, Father. Will you please hear my confession now? - Yes.

793
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:11,232
信仰上帝吧 孩子 我们每个人都会面临死亡
Have faith in your Creator, my son. Death comes to us all.

794
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:13,091
以圣父、圣子以及圣灵之名
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

795
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:16,563
这的确很深刻 “我们每个人都会面临死亡”
That's really deep. "Death comes to us all."

796
01:00:16,632 --> 01:00:18,930
这的确是很深刻
That really is deep.

797
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:21,629
Ferol 怎么了 担心你的运气无法让你坚持下去？
Say, Ferol, what's the matter... afraid your luck isn't going to hold out?

798
01:00:21,704 --> 01:00:24,798
好吧 瞧！这是……这是……我的信仰
Well, look. This is ... This is my religion.

799
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:27,205
噢 伟大的酒瓶 原谅我的罪孽 现在我要躺下长眠了
O Great Bottle, forgive me my sins, for now I lay me down to sleep, Bo peep.

800
01:00:27,276 --> 01:00:29,744
我可以先喝一点你吗？谢谢 阿门
May I drink of you first? Thank you. Amen.

801
01:00:29,846 --> 01:00:34,283
我理解你处于极度痛苦中 我的孩子 但你不能任由它使你变得铁石心肠
I understand your anguish, my son... but you must not let it harden your heart.

802
01:00:34,283 --> 01:00:36,478
我能告诉你一些事吗 神父？
May I tell you something, Father?

803
01:00:36,552 --> 01:00:38,577
在我的家乡 有一座小咖啡馆
Back in my hometown, there was a certain little cafe...

804
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:41,088
吧台上有一条有趣的标语
with an amusing sign over the bar.

805
01:00:41,157 --> 01:00:42,181
是这样写的, “别害怕赊账
It read, "Do not be afraid to ask for credit...

806
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:46,762
因为我们拒绝的方式是非常礼貌的”
for our way of refusing is very polite."

807
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:50,666
来吧 Arnaud 坐下 你喝醉了   - 坐下 - 噢 Paris 别管我
Come on, Arnaud,sit down.You're drunk - Come on. sit down -Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

808
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:53,692
而你 带着你假装虔诚的、油腔滑调的说辞滚出去
And you, get out of here with your sanctimonious pat answers.

809
01:00:53,803 --> 01:00:55,504
你在这里做什么？为了折磨我们？ - 不 为了尽我全部的力量来帮助你们
What are you hanging around for ... to torture us? - No. To help you with all my power.

810
01:00:57,206 --> 01:01:00,443
你的力量？你没有任何力量！- 不 但上帝有力量
Your power? You have no power! - No, but God has power.

811
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:03,105
他有吗？真好笑 - 你会被拯救的
Does he? What a laugh! - You can be saved.

812
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:05,909
拯救？我会被拯救！
Saved? I'll be saved!

813
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,110
够了 Arnaud！
Cut it out, Arnaud!

814
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,251
Arnaud！
Arnaud!

815
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,337
Arnaud
Arnaud.

816
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:24,054
神父 去找医生来 快
Father, get a doctor. Quick.

817
01:01:32,675 --> 01:01:34,376
这会让他保持很长时间的平静 他的颅骨严重骨折
That should keep him quiet long enough.
That's a nasty skull fracture though. 

818
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:39,549
他可能撑不过今晚 - 我们能帮他做什么？
He may not live out the night. What are we supposed to do with him?

819
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:43,315
我建议把他绑在担架上 这样竖起担架的时候 他就不会滑下来
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher so that he won't slip when you tilt it vertically.

820
01:01:43,386 --> 01:01:46,412
他们不会对伤成这样的人行刑的
Surely they won't execute a man in that condition.

821
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:51,016
很遗憾 神父 处决依然会执行 我已经和将军确认过了
I'm sorry, Father. The sentence will be carried out. I've already checked with the general on it.

822
01:01:51,093 --> 01:01:53,128
如果他早上还活着 把他抬出去之前捏几下他的脸
If he's still alive in the morning... pinch his cheeks a couple
of times before you take him out on the field.

823
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:58,031
这会让他睁开眼睛 将军希望他是清醒的
It may make him open his eyes. The general wants him to be conscious.

824
01:02:00,002 --> 01:02:01,526
谁啊？
Yes?

825
01:02:04,106 --> 01:02:07,098
Roget中尉报告 长官- 进来 进来
Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir. - Come in, come in.

826
01:02:08,177 --> 01:02:10,668
Boulanger中士说你要见我 长官
Sergeant Boulanger said that you wanted to see me, sir.

827
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:15,952
是的 中尉 几个小时后将有一件不愉快的事情要我们处理
Yes, Lieutenant. Looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant thing on our hands in a few hours, doesn't it?

828
01:02:15,952 --> 01:02:18,944
你是指行刑 长官？ - 是的
You mean the execution, sir  - Yes, I mean the execution.

829
01:02:19,055 --> 01:02:21,080
是的 长官 这是一件非常不幸的事
Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.

830
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,626
哦 非常不幸 我正是这种感觉
Oh, very unfortunate. That's just how I feel about it.

831
01:02:24,694 --> 01:02:27,390
我们都很难过 长官 
None of us are happy about it, sir.

832
01:02:27,463 --> 01:02:29,294
你是怎么选出Paris下士的？
How'd you happen to pick Corporal Paris?

833
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:32,300
我……我必须得选出个人来 长官 是啊 你必须
Well, I ... I had to pick somebody, sir - That's right. You did.

834
01:02:32,368 --> 01:02:35,137
当然 你选出Paris的时候 不是由于个人恩怨 对吗？
Of course, you had no personal motive in picking Paris, did you?

835
01:02:35,137 --> 01:02:38,374
噢 不是 长官
Oh, no, sir.

836
01:02:38,374 --> 01:02:41,309
你选他 是因为他是懦夫 不是吗？
You picked him because he was a coward, didn't you?

837
01:02:42,712 --> 01:02:45,306
是还是不是？
Well, did you or didn't you?

838
01:02:45,381 --> 01:02:47,406
噢 是的 长官 是这个原因
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

839
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:51,988
诚然 正如你所说 不得不选个人出来
Well ... Like you say, somebody had to be picked.

840
01:02:51,988 --> 01:02:55,651
这是个困难的抉择 长官  - 是的 我现在面对同样的难题
Oh, it was quite a problem, sir  - Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

841
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:58,558
我必须选个人 负责执行明天的行刑
I have to pick someone to be in charge of the firing squad tomorrow.

842
01:02:58,628 --> 01:03:00,858
你对接受这项任务没有任何异议吧？
Do you have any objections to taking the job?

843
01:03:01,998 --> 01:03:04,592
我？长官？ - 是的 你
Me, sir? - Yes, you.

844
01:03:06,936 --> 01:03:08,699
这…… - 怎么了？你觉得这不好？
Well ... - What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

845
01:03:08,771 --> 01:03:12,308
这…… 不…… 我 我没事 长官 我只是……这儿是不是太热了？
Well, no ... Yeah, l-I feel all right, sir. It's just that I ...- Is it too hot in here?

846
01:03:12,308 --> 01:03:16,208
我去打开窗户？不用 长官 不用
Would you like me to open a window? - No, sir. No, sir.

847
01:03:16,779 --> 01:03:21,409
只是……只是我没有负责行刑的经验 长官
Well, it's ... It's just that I've never been in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

848
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:27,089
噢 这没啥 首先你帮中士把他们绑在柱子上
Oh, there's nothing to it. First, you help the sergeant tie the men to the posts.

849
01:03:27,089 --> 01:03:32,194
当然 然后如果他们需要 你给他们戴上眼罩
Of course, you offer the men blindfolds. And, well, if they want them, you tie them on, see?

850
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:35,391
然后 你站在行刑队旁边 举起你的剑
Now, you ...you take your position with the firing squad...you raise your sword

851
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:38,524
“准备 瞄准 射击”
"Ready, aim, fire."

852
01:03:38,634 --> 01:03:41,797
然后 你拔出左轮手枪 走上前
Then you draw your revolver out, you walk forward...

853
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:44,203
朝每个人的头上开一枪
and put a bullet through each man's head.

854
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:48,875
长官 我请求不接受这个任务
Sir, I request that I be excused from this duty.

855
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:51,003
否决
Request denied.

856
01:03:51,113 --> 01:03:54,014
上校 我……- 你要执行这项任务 任务已经都指派给你了
Colonel, I ... - You've got the job.

857
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,017
就这样  - 上校 
It's all yours. That's all, Lieutenant.

858
01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:57,382
如果你可以…… 就这样 中尉！
Colonel, if you could just - That's all, Lieutenant!

859
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,051
谁啊？
Yes?

860
01:04:00,122 --> 01:04:02,090
打扰一下 长官 您是Dax上校吗？ 是的
Excuse me, sir. Colonel Dax? - Yes.

861
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:04,827
我叫Rousseau 长官  - 我是炮兵上尉
My name is Rousseau, sir, Captain of Artillery.

862
01:04:04,827 --> 01:04:08,427
什么事 上尉？
What is it, Captain?

863
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:17,403
我有些事要告诉你 长官 也许与军事法庭有很大的关系
I have something to tell you, sir, that may have a great bearing on the court-martial.

864
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,099
进来 中尉
Come in, Captain.

865
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,695
上校 晚上好  晚上好 长官
Well, Colonel, good evening - Good evening, sir.

866
01:05:16,766 --> 01:05:19,064
晚上好 进来坐  谢谢你 长官
Good evening. Come and sit down - Thank you, sir. I ...

867
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:22,438
我很抱歉 这么唐突地闯到你这里来
I am really sorry to intrude on you in this way.

868
01:05:22,438 --> 01:05:25,601
一点也不 见到你 我总是很高兴 Dax上校 来支雪茄吗？
Not at all. Always delighted to see you, Colonel Dax.Will you have a cigar?

869
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:27,869
不 谢谢你 长官  但我……
No, thank you, sir, but ...

870
01:05:27,943 --> 01:05:31,174
我想你会发现这酒很好喝
Well, I ... -I think you'll find it delicious.

871
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:33,715
我很抱歉没有邀请你来参加今晚楼下的宴会
I must apologize for not inviting you to join the party downstairs tonight...

872
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:37,116
但恐怕这只是些盛装打扮之事
but I'm afraid that it's, uh, a dress affair.

873
01:05:37,186 --> 01:05:38,983
谢谢你 长官 但我得承认
Well, thank you, sir, but I must confess that,

874
01:05:39,054 --> 01:05:42,490
我这次来完全不是社交式的拜访
uh, this is not entirely a social visit.

875
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:47,119
噢 Dax 别再没完没了地提那件事了
Oh, come, Dax, let's not go over all that ground again.

876
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,690
不过 我必须承认 从伤亡上看
Though, uh, I must admit that, judging from the casualties...

877
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,903
你们团作出的努力还是有目共睹的
the efforts of your regiment must have been considerable.

878
01:05:53,903 --> 01:05:57,270
既然你理解这些 怎么还能让这些人明天被枪决？
Now, how can you understand that and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

879
01:05:57,339 --> 01:06:00,206
上校 你看问题的角度太简单了
Oh, come, Colonel. You're choosing to take a rather simple view of this thing.

880
01:06:00,276 --> 01:06:04,610
这次攻击从一开始就是不可能成功的 将军们肯定都清楚
The attack was impossible from the start. The General Staff must have known that.

881
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:10,218
Dax上校 我们认为 我们在战争中表现不错
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing a good job running the war.

882
01:06:10,286 --> 01:06:16,372
你应该清楚 将军们受到了来自报纸和政客们的、各种各样的不公平的压力
You must be aware of the fact that the General Staff... is subject
to all kinds of unfair pressures from newspapers and politicians.

883
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:19,360
也许进攻Ant Hill的行动是不可能成功的
Maybe the attack against the Anthill was impossible.

884
01:06:19,428 --> 01:06:21,589
也许是我们的判断出了问题
Perhaps it was an error of judgment on our part.

885
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:25,760
但从另一方面说 如果你的士兵更勇敢一些的话 他们也许能够攻下
On the other hand, if your men had been a little more daring, they might have taken it.

886
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:28,326
谁知道呢？不管怎样
Who knows? In any case...

887
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:32,203
为什么我们要为失败承担过多的批评呢？
why should we have to bear any more criticism for failure than we have to.

888
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:35,801
另一个不能回避的事实是 你的士兵有很多根本就没有离开战壕
Aside from the inescapable fact that a good many of your men never left the trenches...

889
01:06:35,911 --> 01:06:38,345
部队的士气的确有问题 别忘记这一点
there's the question of the troops' morale. Don't forget that.

890
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,371
部队的士气？- 是的
The troops' morale? - Certainly.

891
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:43,384
处死这些人对整个师来说 将是一剂完美的强心剂
These executions will be a perfect tonic for the entire division.

892
01:06:43,486 --> 01:06:46,046
没有什么比目睹别人的死亡
There are few things more fundamentally encouraging and stimulating...

893
01:06:46,155 --> 01:06:47,986
更能深切地鼓励和刺激人的了
than seeing someone else die.

894
01:06:48,057 --> 01:06:51,049
我从未这样想过 长官 - 你看 上校 部队就像孩子
I never thought of that, sir - You see, Colonel, troops are like children.

895
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,831
就像孩子需要父亲的严格 部队也渴望纪律  - 我知道了
Just as a child wants his father to be firm, troops crave discipline - I see.

896
01:06:55,831 --> 01:06:58,732
维持纪律的方法之一 就是时不时毙掉个士兵
And one way to maintain discipline is to shoot a man now and then.

897
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:02,264
我能否问一下
May I ask...

898
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:05,307
你真的相信你刚才说的话？
do you sincerely believe all the things you've just said?

899
01:07:10,246 --> 01:07:12,180
很高兴和你讨论这些 上校
It's been a pleasure discussing this with you, Colonel...

900
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:15,649
但恐怕我最好还是回去陪我的客人
but I'm afraid that I'd better be getting back to my guests.

901
01:07:15,718 --> 01:07:18,653
请原谅 没让你享受到宴会时光
Forgive me for having kept you from your party.

902
01:07:20,689 --> 01:07:24,386
哦 对了 长官 你是否听说了Mireau将军
Oh, by the way, sir, have you heard that General Mireau...

903
01:07:24,426 --> 01:07:27,827
在这次攻击时 命令自己的炮兵指挥官
ordered his own battery commander, Captain Rousseau...

904
01:07:27,897 --> 01:07:32,423
Rousseau上尉 炮击自己阵地的事？
to open fire on his own positions during the attack? ?

905
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,901
当然 在没有书面命令的情况下 上尉拒绝了
Well, of course the captain refused without a written order...

906
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:41,374
但是Mireau将军命令他 向我们自己的战壕开火
but General Mireau demanded that he commence firing on our own trenches.

907
01:07:41,443 --> 01:07:44,880
出于同样的原因 Rousseau再一次拒绝了
Again Rousseau refused without an order in writing...

908
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,146
但是将军再下命令 再被拒绝
but again he was ordered, and again he refused ...

909
01:07:49,218 --> 01:07:50,947
这些都有证人
all in front of witnesses.

910
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,750
你真的相信这个不切实际的故事？
Do you actually believe this fantastic story?

911
01:07:53,822 --> 01:07:57,952
这里有几份主要证人的宣誓证词
Here are copies of the sworn statements from all the principals involved ...

912
01:07:58,027 --> 01:08:01,724
炮兵指挥官Rousseau 火炮着弹点观察员Nichols上尉
Battery Commander Rousseau, Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter...

913
01:08:01,797 --> 01:08:05,631
电话秘书和我自己的宣誓证词
the telephone clerk and, uh, my own deposition.

914
01:08:05,701 --> 01:08:09,831
这些和那些被判有罪的犯人之间有什么关系？
What has all this got to do with the charge against the condemned prisoners?

915
01:08:09,905 --> 01:08:13,568
一位将军 在一次本来就不可能成功的进攻失败后
A general in a tantrum over the failure of an impossible attack...

916
01:08:13,642 --> 01:08:17,408
气急败坏地命令他的炮兵向自己人开炮
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

917
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:21,313
同一名军官在同一天组织了一个军事法庭
Now, this same officer on the same day...

918
01:08:21,383 --> 01:08:25,342
判决他的三名士兵死刑
orders a court-martial in which three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

919
01:08:25,454 --> 01:08:30,551
将军 你的报纸和政客们知道这些会怎么样？
General, what would your, uh, newspapers and your politicians do with that?

920
01:08:31,627 --> 01:08:34,194
Dax上校 您想威胁我吗？ 
Colonel Dax, are you trying to blackmail me?

921
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:38,267
长官 这个词可不好听 但是你现在处境很困难
Sir, that's an ugly word, but you are in a difficult position.

922
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:42,409
发生了太多的事情 总有人要受到伤害 唯一问题是 伤害谁
Too much has happened. Someone's got to be hurt. The only question is who.

923
01:08:44,473 --> 01:08:47,465
Mireau将军进攻Ant Hill的行动失败了
General Mireau's assault on the Anthill failed...

924
01:08:47,576 --> 01:08:51,342
他下令炮击自己部队的命令被拒绝了
and his order to fire on this own troops was refused.

925
01:08:51,413 --> 01:08:53,813
他为了保护他自己的声誉 企图谋杀三个无辜的人
But his attempt to murder three innocent men...

926
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,319
他的企图将会被将军们制止
to protect his own reputation will be prevented by the General Staff.

927
01:09:05,494 --> 01:09:09,978
请原谅 Dax上校 我已经让客人们等太久了
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax? I've been rude to my guests too long.

928
01:09:38,692 --> 01:09:40,592
立――定！
Detail, halt!

929
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:44,557
持枪立正！
Order arms!

930
01:09:44,632 --> 01:09:46,566
行动！
Fall out!

931
01:10:12,092 --> 01:10:16,503
勇敢些 我的孩子 最坏的时候已经过去了
Courage, my son. The worst is over.

932
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:29,101
早上好 Paris
Good morning, Paris.

933
01:10:29,209 --> 01:10:31,311
早上好 中士 今天感觉如何？
Good morning, Sergeant.

934
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:36,773
还行吧 你呢？
- How are you today? - Not too bad. How are you?

935
01:10:38,919 --> 01:10:41,217
你错过了昨晚这儿的美餐
You missed some good chow in here last night.

936
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,654
都有什么好吃的？
What'd you have?

937
01:10:46,026 --> 01:10:48,859
给我们带酒了吗？
Have you got a drink for us?

938
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:51,397
痛快喝吧
Take a swig of this.

939
01:10:54,735 --> 01:10:58,193
这件事居然发生在我身上了 真是好笑 我……
It just occurred to me ... A funny thing.

940
01:10:58,305 --> 01:11:01,172
从庭审到现在我连一次性幻想都没出现
I haven't had one sexual thought since the court-martial.

941
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:03,259
很了不起 不是吗？
It's pretty extraordinary, isn't it?

942
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,309
起来 像个男人点
Pull yourself together. Act like a man.

943
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:11,208
听着 Paris 你在听吗？- 是的
Listen, Paris. Are you listening to me?

944
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:13,377
很多高官、记者都在外面
There will be a lot of dignitaries, newspapermen out there.

945
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:15,546
你有妻子和家庭 你想留给他们怎样的印象？
You've got a wife and family. How do you want to be remembered?

946
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:17,815
我不想死
I don't wanna die.

947
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,516
我们中的很多人 在战争结束前也会死的
Many of us will be joining you before this war's over.

948
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:23,095
我不管 我不想死
I don't care. I don't wanna die.

949
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:28,624
救救我 中士  - 我救不了你 现在谁也救不了你了
Please save me, Sergeant  - I can't save you. No one can now.

950
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:32,968
这是你生前有机会做的最后一个决定
This is the last decision you'll have a chance to make on earth.

951
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,667
你可以像男子汉一样站直了 否则我们只有把你拖出去
You can pull yourself together, act like a man, or we'll have to drag you out of here.

952
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:39,645
最终结果都是一样的 这取决于你
In the end, it'll all be the same. It's up to you.

953
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,863
快点吧 你和Ferol 把外衣脱掉 在这儿耽搁没有意义
Well, let's get busy. You and Ferol take your coats off. It's no use hanging around here.

954
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:21,649
愿全能的主垂怜我们 赦免我的罪
...with the help of thy grace to do penance

955
01:12:21,722 --> 01:12:27,676
使我得到永生
and to amend my life.

956
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,221
Amen.

957
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:33,999
为什么我必须死？我到底为什么而死？
Why do I have to die? For what?

958
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:40,267
为什么我必须死？为什么？我什么也没做
Why do I have to die? Why? I didn't do anything.

959
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:43,366
我们不要怀疑上帝的旨意 我的孩子
We do not question the will of God, my son.

960
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:47,675
但是我曾战斗 我曾战斗 我曾在战场上战斗
But I fought. I fought. I fought on the battlefield.

961
01:12:47,748 --> 01:12:51,206
他们为什么不死？为什么不让他们去死？
Why don't they die? Why not put them to death?

962
01:12:51,318 --> 01:12:53,786
你在敌人面前展示了你的英勇 我的孩子
You showed courage in the face of the enemy, my son.

963
01:12:53,887 --> 01:12:55,752
现在在自己的部队面前展示吧
Show it now before your own troops.

964
01:12:55,823 --> 01:12:58,257
但是我害怕 我害怕
But I'm scared. I'm scared.

965
01:12:59,593 --> 01:13:02,619
噢 神父 我好害怕 噢 上帝啊
Oh, Father, I'm scared. Oh, my God.

966
01:13:02,729 --> 01:13:06,096
勇敢点 稳住情绪 士兵 稳住情绪
Courage. Brace yourself, man. Brace yourself.

967
01:13:13,841 --> 01:13:17,675
他说：“这一天 你当与我同在天堂”
He said, "This day, thou shalt be with me in paradise."

968
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:22,647
真的吗 神父？ - 是的
Really, Father? - Yes.

969
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:27,148
我再也见不到我妻子了 神父
I don't understand why... 

970
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:31,918
我再也见不到任何人了 神父
I'll never see nobody again, Father. Please.

971
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,392
勇敢点 士兵 稳住情绪
Courage, man. Brace yourself.

972
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:37,055
我做不到 - 稳住情绪
I can't help it  - Brace yourself.

973
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:42,158
我做不到 神父 噢 - 上帝 全能的上帝……
I can't help it, Father - O God, O Almighty God ...

974
01:13:42,269 --> 01:13:46,103
噢 基督！基督！- 赐给这个人勇气 他即将面临死亡
Oh, Christ! Christ! Grant courage to this man who is about to die.

975
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:47,902
赐我力量 上帝！请赐我力量！
Strengthen me, God! Please strengthen me!

976
01:13:54,548 --> 01:13:57,483
为什么我必须死呢 神父？
Why do I have to die, Father?

977
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,045
为什么我必须死呢 神父？
Why do I have to die, Father?

978
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:04,953
向后――转！
About face!

979
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:17,029
绑好囚犯！
Secure prisoners!

980
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:21,807
全队注意！
Detail, attention!

981
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:26,503
齐步――走！
Forward march! 

982
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,478
立……
Detail,

983
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:38,048
定！
halt!

984
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:40,183
向左――转！
Left face!

985
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,287


986
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,239
请别 请别选我……
Please don't. Please choose me to ... 

987
01:15:14,628 --> 01:15:17,495
以法国人民的名义
"In the name of the French People...

988
01:15:17,598 --> 01:15:21,683
701团 下士Phillip Paris 二等兵Maurice Ferol
"Corporal Philippe Paris... "Private Maurice Ferol...

989
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:26,068
二等兵Pierre Arnaud
"and Private Pierre Arnaud... "of the 701 st Regiment...

990
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:31,202
被判有罪 罪名是在敌人面前表现怯懦
"having been found guilty of cowardice in the face of the enemy...

991
01:15:31,311 --> 01:15:34,508
根据军事法庭的裁决
"are to be executed by rifle fire immediately...

992
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:38,449
立即执行枪决
in accordance with the judgment of the military court-martial."

993
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:47,209
向右――转!
Right face!

994
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,294
齐步――走!
Forward hut!

996
01:16:08,548 --> 01:16:11,039
要蒙上眼睛吗？
Do you want a blindfold?

997
01:16:11,118 --> 01:16:14,554
是的 中尉 拜托
Yes, Lieutenant. Please.

998
01:16:19,326 --> 01:16:21,726
我不想死 我不想死
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

999
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:39,469
要……要蒙上眼睛吗？不
Do ... Do you want a blindfold?- No.

1000
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,514
对不起
I'm sorry.

1001
01:17:05,739 --> 01:17:07,673
噢 神父
Oh,father

1002
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,078
准备！
Ready!

1003
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:26,288
瞄准！
Aim!

1004
01:17:28,462 --> 01:17:30,020
射击！
Fire! 

1005
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:36,031
我非常高兴你能在那儿 George
I'm awfully glad you could be there, George.

1006
01:17:36,103 --> 01:17:38,901
这种事情总是很残酷的
This sort of thing is always rather grim.

1007
01:17:38,972 --> 01:17:41,099
但这一次却带有几分辉煌 你不觉得吗？
But this one had a kind of splendor to it, don't you think?

1008
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:43,642
我没见过处理得这么完美的
I have never seen an affair of this sort handled any better.

1009
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,662
他们死得干脆利落
The men died wonderfully.

1010
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,370
往往会有可能 其中某个人会闹出些乱子 让大家都不爽
There's always that chance that one of them will do something
that will leave everyone with a bad taste.

1011
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,880
恐怕没有比这一次更完美的了
This time, you couldn't ask for better.

1012
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:55,948
谁啊？
Yes?

1013
01:17:57,257 --> 01:17:59,657
是上校吗？ - 你要见我 长官
Yes, Colonel? You wanted to see me, sir.

1014
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,991
噢 是的 是的 请进 上校 进来坐
Oh, yes, yes. Come in, Colonel. Come in and sit down.

1015
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:08,496
噢 Dax上校 你的人死得很好
Oh, Colonel Dax, your men died very well.

1016
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:14,105
喝点咖啡吗 上校？- 不 谢谢你 长官
Would you like some coffee, Colonel? - No, thank you, sir.

1017
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:16,525
噢 对了 Paul 我听说攻打Ant Hill的过程中
Oh, by the way, Paul, it's been brought to my attention...

1018
01:18:17,525 --> 01:18:20,511
你命令炮兵向自己人炮击
that you ordered your artillery to fire on your own men during the attack on the Anthill.

1019
01:18:22,415 --> 01:18:24,241
我下了什么命令？
I did what? 

1020
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:28,679
谁告诉你的？ - Dax上校昨晚来对我说的
Who told you that? - Colonel Dax came to me last night with the story.

1021
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:35,393
Dax上校 我一直很清楚 你不是个忠心耿耿的军官
Colonel Dax, I've always known that you were a disloyal officer...

1022
01:18:35,462 --> 01:18:38,829
但是我没想到你会使如此低劣的手段
but I never dreamed that you would stoop to anything so low as this.

1023
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:43,199
将军 我有一些宣誓证词 你的火炮着弹点观察员Nichols上尉的
General, I have sworn statements from Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter...

1024
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:46,034
拒绝执行命令的炮兵指挥官Rousseau上尉的
Captain Rousseau, the battery commander who refused your order.

1025
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:48,370
这太无耻了 极其无耻
I think it's infamous, absolutely infamous.

1026
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:50,705
那Dax上校的指控都不是事实？
Then there's no truth at all to the charge made by Colonel Dax?

1027
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,177
难道这还用问吗？
I don't see how you could even ask me that.

1028
01:18:53,246 --> 01:18:55,680
你想不到我听你这么说会有多高兴 Paul
You cannot imagine how glad I am to hear that, Paul.

1029
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:58,275
我确信你将顺利度过这一关
I'm certain that you'll come through it all right.

1030
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,853
我度过什么？- 不得不展开一次调查
I'll come through what? - There will have to be an inquiry.

1031
01:19:00,954 --> 01:19:04,658
调查？- 但不会太多的 这种事情从不会太多 公众很健忘的
An inquiry? - But it won't amount to much. Those things never do. The public forgets.

1032
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:07,491
公众？- 你应该有权澄清自己的名誉
"Public"? - You've got to have the right to clear your name.

1033
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:12,999
你不能允许这些影响你形象的恶劣言辞恣意横流
You cannot allow such vile insinuations against your character to go undenied.

1034
01:19:13,099 --> 01:19:15,033
好吧 到此为止吧
So that's it.

1035
01:19:16,203 --> 01:19:18,171
你把我当山羊吗
You're making me the goat ...

1036
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:21,230
我才是整个事件中唯一无辜的人
the only completely innocent man in this whole affair.

1037
01:19:25,645 --> 01:19:29,103
我只有最后一件事要告诉你 George
I have only one last thing to say to you, George.

1038
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:32,913
被你在背后捅刀子的 是个军人
The man you stabbed in the back is a soldier.

1039
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:43,253
嗯
Well...

1040
01:19:44,764 --> 01:19:46,459
不得不这么做
had to be done.

1041
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:49,866
法国不能让傻瓜来决定军队的命运
France cannot afford to have fools guiding her military destiny.

1042
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:52,962
谢谢你 Dax 让我注意到这件事
I'm grateful to you, Dax, for having brought this matter to my attention.

1043
01:19:53,073 --> 01:19:56,509
Dax上校 你对Mireau将军的工作怎么看？
Colonel Dax, how would you like General Mireau's job?

1044
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:00,677
他的什么？ - 他的工作
His what, sir? - His job.

1045
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:04,380
我还是开门见山的说吧 长官
Let me get this straight, sir.

1046
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:07,284
你是让我接替Mireau将军的统帅职位？
You're offering me General Mireau's command?

1047
01:20:07,354 --> 01:20:10,187
Dax上校 不用过于表现你的惊讶吧
Come, come, Colonel Dax. Don't overdo the surprise.

1048
01:20:10,257 --> 01:20:13,590
你从一开始就想要这份工作了 我们都知道的 我的孩子
You've been after the job from the start. We all know that, my boy.

1049
01:20:14,694 --> 01:20:17,686
我可能是很多东西 长官 但是我不是你的孩子
I may be many things, sir, but I'm not your boy.

1050
01:20:17,797 --> 01:20:20,732
好吧 我当然不是指任何血缘上的关系
Well, I certainly didn't mean to imply any biological relationship.

1051
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,825
从任何意义上说我都不是你的孩子 - 你是在激怒我吗 上校？
I'm not your boy in any sense  - You trying to provoke me, Colonel?

1052
01:20:22,936 --> 01:20:25,063
我为什么要激怒你？- 没错 如果在晋升之前
Why should I want to do that, sir? - Exactly.

1053
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,900
就失去你精心策划而得到的晋升机会
It would be a pity to lose your promotion before you get it...

1054
01:20:27,999 --> 01:20:29,171
那将会很可惜
a promotion you have so very carefully planned for.

1055
01:20:32,312 --> 01:20:36,112
长官 你想要我来暗示 你有权决定这次职务任免？
Sir, would you like me to suggest what you can do with that promotion?

1056
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:40,619
Dax上校 立刻向我道歉 否则你将会被逮捕
Colonel Dax! You will apologize at once, or I shall have you placed under arrest!

1057
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:45,756
我为对你不够诚实而道歉
I apologize for not being entirely honest with you.

1058
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:49,659
我为隐藏我的真实情感而道歉
I apologize for not revealing my true feelings.

1059
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:51,890
我道歉 长官 因为我没有早点告诉你
I apologize, sir, for not telling you sooner...

1060
01:20:51,965 --> 01:20:54,934
你是个堕落的、以他人痛苦为乐的老头子
that you're a degenerate, sadistic old man...

1061
01:20:55,001 --> 01:20:58,903
在我向你道歉之前 你可以下地狱了！
and you can go to hell before I apologize to you now or ever again!

1062
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:05,705
Dax上校 你让我很失望
Colonel Dax, you're a disappointment to me.

1063
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:09,806
任凭自己感情用事 令你的头脑不再灵敏
You've spoiled the keenness of your mind by wallowing in sentimentality.

1064
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:11,941
你确实很想救那些人
You really did want to save those men...

1065
01:21:12,052 --> 01:21:14,850
你也不觊觎Mireau将军的统帅职位
and you were not angling for Mireau's command.

1066
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:18,755
你是一个理想主义者 我同情你就好像同情一个乡下白痴
You're an idealist, and I pity you as I would the village idiot.

1067
01:21:18,825 --> 01:21:21,293
我们在打一场战争 Dax 我们要赢得胜利
We're fighting a war, Dax, a war that we've got to win.

1068
01:21:21,394 --> 01:21:23,362
那些人没有战斗 所以他们被枪决
Those men didn't fight, so they were shot.

1069
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:27,866
你控告Mireau将军 所以我坚持让他应诉
You bring charges against General Mireau, so I insist that he answer them.

1070
01:21:27,934 --> 01:21:30,061
我哪里做错了呢？
Wherein have I done wrong?

1071
01:21:33,173 --> 01:21:37,075
因为你不知道那个问题的答案
Because you don't know the answer to that question...

1072
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:40,078
我可怜你
I pity you.

1073
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:08,140
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

1074
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:10,608
先生们 我们为你们准备了一点特别的娱乐节目
Now, gentlemen, we have a little special entertainment for you.

1075
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:12,110


1076
01:22:15,882 --> 01:22:18,680
就像以前那样 来点儿消遣
Sort of a ... sort of a little diversion as it were.

1077
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:23,314
如同我妻子经常说的 “要是没有点儿消遣 生活还算是什么？”
And as my wife always says, "What is life without a little diversion?"

1078
01:22:25,258 --> 01:22:29,718
现在 先生们 我为你们献上 我们最新从敌人手上获得的战利品
Now, gentlemen, I give you our latest acquisition from the enemy.

1079
01:22:29,829 --> 01:22:31,091


1080
01:22:31,931 --> 01:22:36,534
从德国来的！
- From Germany  - The land of the Hun.

1081
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:04,159
先生们 随着战争的潮汐
Gentlemen, a little pearl washed ashore

1082
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:09,442
冲上岸的一颗小珍珠
by the tide of war.

1083
01:23:15,608 --> 01:23:19,544
嘿 讲一种文明人的语言吧
Hey! Talk in a civilized language.

1084
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:22,779
的确 这位年轻的女士有她自身的不足
It's true the little lady has her limitations.

1085
01:23:22,849 --> 01:23:26,114
事实上 她绝对没有任何才能
As a matter of fact, she has absolutely no talent at all ...

1086
01:23:26,186 --> 01:23:32,965
此外 好吧 也许有一点点天赋
except, that is, well, maybe a little natural talent? 

1087
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:38,030
这位年轻的小姐不会跳舞 不会讲笑话
The little lady can't dance, she can't tell any jokes...

1088
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:40,766
也不会用她的小鼻子顶橡皮球
and she can't balance rubber balls on her little nose.

1089
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:46,230
啊 但她的歌声像鸟儿一样 她有一副金嗓子
Ah, but she can sing like a bird. She has a throat of gold.

1090
01:23:46,339 --> 01:23:51,526
来吧 宝贝！- 来吧 亲爱的！给我们唱支歌！
- Come on, baby! - Come on, honey! Sing us a song! - Come on, honey! How about a song?

1091
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,993
- 来吧 亲爱的！唱支歌！
Come on, baby! Sing us a song!

1092
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,518
大点声！大声点！
Louder! Louder!

1093
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:25,731
长官 - 什么事 中士？
Sir - Yes, Sergeant?

1094
01:26:25,798 --> 01:26:28,733
我们奉命立刻返回前线
We have orders to move back to the front immediately.

1095
01:26:30,303 --> 01:26:33,067
再多给他们几分钟吧  - 遵命 长官
Give the men a few minutes more, Sergeant  - Yes, sir.
