1
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:19,435


2
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:41,850
War began between
Germany and France on August 3, 1914.

3
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,770
Five weeks later,
the German army had smashed its way...

4
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,106
to within 18 miles of Paris.

5
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,443
There, the battered French miraculously
rallied their forces at the Marne River...

6
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,779
- and in a series
of unexpected counterattacks —
- Detail, halt!

7
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,948
- drove the Germans back.


8
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,741
The front was stabilized...

9
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,369
then shortly afterwards developed
into a continuous line...

10
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,371
of heavily fortified trenches...

11
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,706
zigzagging their way 500 miles...

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,459
from the English Channel
to the Swiss frontier.

13
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,464
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare...

14
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,758
the battle lines had changed very little.

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,138
Successful attacks were measured
in hundreds of yards...

16
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,266
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

17
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,062
General Broulard, sir.

18
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,606
- Hello, George. How are you?

19
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,359
Paul, wonderful seeing you again.
Really wonderful.

20
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,904
Well, this is splendid. It's superb.

21
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,157
It's grand, very grand.

22
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,951
Well, I've tried to create
a pleasant atmosphere in which to work.

23
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,704
Well, you've succeeded marvelously.
I wish I had your taste in carpets —

24
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,455
- Oh! 
- and pictures.

25
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,499
You're much too kind, George.
Much too kind.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,501
- Sit down, George.
- Thank you.

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:54,089
I really haven't done very much. The place
is much the same as it was when I moved in.

28
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,886
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

29
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,181
It's top secret and must go no further
than your chief of staff...

30
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,516
and not to him
unless you can trust his discretion.

31
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,934
Of course.

32
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,563
A group of armies is forming on this front
for an offensive very soon.

33
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,857
Headquarters is determined
to make a complete breakthrough.

34
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,359
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm really sorry.

35
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,821
I thought for just a moment I knew
what you were going to say. Please go on.

36
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,867
I never knew you were a mind reader.
What did you think I was about to say?

37
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,578
- Something about the "Anthill."
- You are a mind reader.

38
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,332
Well, it is a key position.
It's in my sector.

39
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,500
To be perfectly honest,
I've heard some talk.

40
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,920
You know, there's nothing really secret
around headquarters.

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,924
- Well, what do you think?
- It's the key to the whole
German position in this sector.

42
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,009
They've held on to it for a year now...

43
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,803
and it looks as though they'll hold on to it
for another year if they want to.

44
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,264
Paul, I have formal orders
to take the Anthill no later than the 10th.

45
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,976
- That's the day after tomorrow.
- That comes pretty close
to being ridiculous, don't you think?

46
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,647
I don't imagine I'd be here
if I really thought that.

47
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,235
Paul, if there's one man
in this army who can do this for me, it's you.

48
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,239
It's out of the question, George.
Absolutely out of the question.

49
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,407
My division was cut to pieces.

50
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,036
What's left of it is in no position
to even hold the Anthill, let alone take it.

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,121
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

52
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,626
Well, Paul, there was something else
I wanted to tell you.

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,462
However, I'm sure that you'll misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

54
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,048
- What was it?
- Oh.

55
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,342
You'd be bound to misunderstand.

56
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,971
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

57
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,347
What are you trying to say, George?

58
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:30,435
Paul, talk around headquarters is that you
are being considered for the 12th Corps.

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,230
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

60
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,232
Now, I've pushed it all I can.

61
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,610
The 12th Corps needs a fighting general,
and you're overdue on that star.

62
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,904
Now, we both know
that your record is good enough...

63
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,782
for you to refuse this assignment
on the grounds you've stated.

64
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,784
No one would question your opinion.

65
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,328
They'd simply get someone else
to do thejob.

66
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,040
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion, Paul.

67
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,045
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks, Paul, not before dinner.

68
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,886
George, I'm responsible
for the lives of 8,000 men.

69
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,932
What is my ambition against that?

70
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,352
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

71
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,564
My men come first of all, George,
and those men know it too.

72
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,482
I know that they do.

73
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,652
You see, George, those men know
that I would never let them down.

74
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,404
That goes without saying.

75
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,698
The life of one ofthose soldiers
means more to me...

76
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,035
than all the stars and decorations
and honors in France.

77
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,454
So...

78
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,333
you think this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

79
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,585
I didn't say that, George.

80
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,089
Nothing is beyond those men,
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

81
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,176
Paul, I don't want to push you into it
ifyou think it's ill-advised.

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,471
Don't worry, George.
You couldn't do that if you tried.

83
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,475
Of course, artillery would make
an enormous difference.

84
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,395
- What artillery support can you give me?
- Well, I'll see.

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,147
What about replacements?

86
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:01,151
We'll see what we can do, but I feel sure
that you can get along with what you have.

87
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,779
- Might just do it.
- Oh, Paul.

88
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,699
I knew that I was right to come to you.
You are the man to take the Anthill.

89
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,078
- Now, as far as that star is concerned —
- That had nothing to do with my decision.

90
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,915
- If anything, it would sway me the other way.
- I realize that perfectly, Paul.

91
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,000
Now, when do you say
you see this coming off?

92
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,378
No later than the day after tomorrow.

93
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,129
We just might do it.

94
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,238
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

95
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,240
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name, soldier?

96
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,033
Sir, Private Ferol, Company "A."

97
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,119
- Uh-huh. Are you married, Private?
- No, sir.

98
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,746
- Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.
- Yes, sir.

99
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,707
- Well, carry on, Private, and good luck to you.

100
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,709
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

101
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,258
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning.

102
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,136
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

103
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,264
- Yes, sir.
- Aha! Working over your rifle, I see.

104
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,724
Well, that's the way.
It's a soldier's best f riend.

105
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,227
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

106
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,229
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,984
[Chuckles]
Well, uh, good luck to you, soldier.

108
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,069
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

109
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,710


110
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,347
Hello there, soldier.

111
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,892
Ready to kill more Germans?

112
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,145
Well, is everything all right, soldier?

113
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,273
All right? Yes, sir, I'm all right.

114
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,401
Aha. Good fellow.
Are you married, soldier?

115
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,112
- Married? Me, married?

116
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,492
- Yes. Have you got a wife?
- A wife? Have I got a wife?

117
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,827
Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

118
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,831
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

119
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,377
- Have you got a wife, soldier?
- My wife?

120
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,339
My wife. Yes, I have a wife.

121
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,091
I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm gonna be killed.

122
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,927
Get a grip on yourself!
You're acting like a coward!

123
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,554
- I am a coward, sir.
- Snap out of it, soldier!

124
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,600
Sergeant, I want you to arrange
for the immediate transfer of this baby
out of my regiment!

125
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,269
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him!

126
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,772
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

127
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,154
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

128
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,365
You know, General,
I'm convinced that these tours of yours...

129
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,034
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men.

130
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,912
In fact, I think the fighting spirit
ofthe 701st derives from it.

131
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,081
No, no, Major.
That spirit was just born in them.

132
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,832

133
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,461

134
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,423
The general is coming, sir.

135
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,639

136
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,066
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
- I'm honored, General.

137
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,151
It's our privilege entirely.

138
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,405
- Well, quite a neat little spot you have here.
- Colonel.

139
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,408
I reserve comment on the neatness, sir,
but it is little.

140
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,411
- Pretty shy on seating
accommodations though.

141
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,747
More than enough for me.
I never got the habit of sitting.

142
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,500
Like to be on my feet.
Keep on the move.

143
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,335
I can vouch for that, Colonel.

144
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,630
I can hardly get the general behind a desk
long enough to sign an order.

145
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,757
Well, that's the way I am, you know, Dax.

146
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,760
I can't understand these armchair officers...

147
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,971
fellows trying to fight a war
from behind a desk...

148
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,973
waving papers at the enemy...

149
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,143
worrying about whether a mouse
is going to run up their pants leg.

150
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,104
I don't know, General. If I had the choice
between mice and Mausers...

151
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,106
I think I'd take the mice every time.

152
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,108
You'll never make me believe that, Colonel.

153
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,652
Seriously though, if a man's a ninny...

154
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,113
let him put on a dress
and hide under the bed.

155
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,325
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then, by heavens, he's got to be one.

156
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,494
He's got to fight, and he can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

157
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,622
That's my credo.

158
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,958
I think I have to agree with you,
presenting your case so convincingly, sir.

159
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,252
And you've never failed
to live up to it, sir.

160
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,630
- I imagine you'd like
a look around, wouldn't you?
- Yes, Colonel.

161
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,215
- Well, here's something to see.

162
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,594
The Anthill. About as good a view
as you can get without actually being there.

163
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,971
Well, that won't be long now, will it?

164
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,973

165
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,727
- Ah.

166
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,729
Ah. Yeah.

167
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,359
Well, I've seen
much more formidable objectives.

168
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,402
Much, much worse.

169
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,370
Well, not something we can grab
and run away with...

170
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,664
but certainly pregnable.

171
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,500
- Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it?
- Why?

172
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,002
Well, like something to do
with giving birth.

173
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,047
Oh, yes. Quite. You're right
on your toes this morning, Colonel.

174
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,007
Even sharper than usual.

175
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,053
But we mustn't forget,
the colonel was perhaps the foremost
criminal lawyer in all France.

176
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,098
- Of course, General.
- Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

177
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,435
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

178
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,522
We drew some artillery.
Twenty-nine casualties, sir.

179
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,524
Yes, I noticed it on the road in.

180
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,651
Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

181
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,696
All swarmed together like a bunch of flies,
just waiting for someone to swat 'em.

182
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,698
Well, they never learn, it seems.

183
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,326
They get in a tight spot under heavy fire,
gang up every time.

184
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,079
Herd instinct, I suppose.
Kind of a lower-animal sort of thing.

185
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,373
Kind of a human sort of thing,
it seems to me...

186
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,500
or don't you make a distinction
between the two, Major?

187
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,045
Oh, yes, uh, very regrettable, of course.
Very. Yes, indeed.

188
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,590
Uh, Major, would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes?

189
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,676
Yes, sir. Of course.

190
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,846
Colonel.

191
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,808

192
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,477
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

193
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,439
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Anthill.

194
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,817
Colonel, your regiment
is going to take the Anthill tomorrow.

195
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,237
You know the condition of my men, sir.

196
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,699
Oh, naturally, men are going to have to
be killed. Possibly a lot of them.

197
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,784
They absorb bullets and shrapnel...

198
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,328
and by doing so make it possible
for others to get through.

199
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,039
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

200
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,419
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

201
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,255
Hmm, say, five percent killed
by our own barrage.

202
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,257
That's a very generous allowance.

203
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,676
Ten percent more
in getting through no-man's-land...

204
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,970
and 20% more getting through the wire.

205
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,891
That leaves 65%
with the worst part of the job over.

206
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,978
Let's say another 25%
in actually taking the Anthill.

207
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,148
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

208
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,067
General, you're saying that more
than half of my men will be killed.

209
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,112
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel...

210
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,865
but we will have the Anthill.

211
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,118
- But will we, sir?
- I'm depending on you, Colonel.

212
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,204
All France is depending on you.

213
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,084
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

214
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,881
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need a flag
waved in front of me to get me to charge.

215
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,051
I don't think I like your comparison
of the flag of France to a bullfighter's cape.

216
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,136
I meant nothing disrespectful
to the flag of France, sir.

217
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,348
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,
but show me a patriot,
and I'll show you an honest man.

218
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,099
Not everyone has always thought so.

219
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,644
Samuel Johnson had something else
to say about patriotism.

220
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,647
And what was that, may I ask?

221
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,899
- Nothing really.
- What you do mean, "Nothing really"?

222
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,734
Well, sir, nothing really important.

223
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,820
Colonel, when I ask a question,
it's always important.

224
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,030
- Now, who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

225
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,741
All right. Now, what did he
have to say about patriotism?

226
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,160
He said it was the last refuge
of a scoundrel, sir.

227
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,246
I'm sorry. I meant nothing personal.

228
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,500
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

229
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,961
It's you who are exhausted, not your men.

230
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,381
And it's my f ault. I've given you
one impossible task after another.

231
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,509
- You need rest. You need it badly.
- I haven't said anything
about needing rest, sir.

232
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,554
And you never would either. Therefore, you're
not going to have any say-so about it, Colonel.

233
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,139
As from right now,
I'm ordering you on indefinite furlough.

234
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,976
General,
you can't take me away from my men.
You can't do that to me, sir.

235
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,688
Not to you, Dax. Foryou.
For your good and f or the good ofyour men.

236
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,731
The good of my men, sir?

237
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,360
If a commanding officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

238
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,656
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you,
but I must have your enthusiastic support.

239
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,951
Not once have you said
that your men can take the Anthill.

240
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,622
We'll take the Anthill.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,377
If any soldiers in the world can take it...

242
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,713
we'll take the Anthill.

243
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,300
And when you do,
your men will be relieved and get a long rest.

244
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,276
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune
reporting, sir.

245
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,572
- You took your time about it.
- We prepared as quick as we could, sir.

246
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,574
We had to alert the sentries.

247
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,576
All right. You men, at ease.

248
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,288
This is a reconnaissance patrol —
German wire, machine gun posts...

249
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,332
identification of bodies.

250
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,627
There will only be the three of us,
and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

251
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,254

252
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,008
We go out to the left, and we come back
through Post 6 on the right.

253
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,802
- Is everything all clear at Post 6?
- All the sentries have
been warned up to here.

254
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,306
Number 6 will send up flares
at 10-minute intervals starting at 04:00.

255
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,184
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I told them that, sir.

256
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,646
The sergeant says
every five minutes is too much.
He says it's certain to draw artillery.

257
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,773
Quite a strategist, this sergeant.
What's his name?

258
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,192
I don't know, sir.

259
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,572
All right. You men wait outside.
I'll join you in a minute.

260
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,616
Would you mind telling us
the password, sir?

261
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,701
- Calais.
- Yes, sir.

262
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,505
- He's fortifying himself.
- It smelled like heaven.

263
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,716
I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

264
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,886
Well, at least he could have
passed it around, the pig.

265
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,764
Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

266
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,517
We went to school together
before the war.

267
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,311
He thinks I don't have enough
respect for him. He's right.

268
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,816
If you gentlemen are ready.

269
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,198
- Colonel.
- Everything clear and understood?

270
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,950
Yes, sir.

271
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,244
The lane through our wire
is right out in front here.

272
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,705
Machine guns are pointing
at the opening.

273
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,707
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.

274
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,750
All right, men. Let's go.

275
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,035
- What's that?
- I don't know.

276
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,665
Lejeune, move out and look that over.
We'll cover you.

277
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,793
Split up a night patrol?

278
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,878
Move out, Lejeune.

279
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,631

280
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,147

281
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,008
- I don't like this. Let's get out of here.
- We haven't given him enough time.

282
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,684
- If we wait any longer, they'll get us too.
- We've got to wait for him.

283
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,192
He must be dead. Where is he?

284
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,986

285
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,990
Roget!

286
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,704

287
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,628
- Well.
- Surprised, Lieutenant?

288
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,173
Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

289
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,343
You didn't wait around to find out,
did you, Lieutenant?

290
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,345
Now, look here. What do you mean?

291
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,223
I mean, you ran like a rabbit
after you killed Lejeune.

292
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,768
Killed Lejeune?
What are you talking about?

293
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,313
I don't think I like your tone.

294
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,690
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

295
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,152

Oh, well, I must be mistaken then, sir.

296
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,654
An officer wouldn't do that.

297
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,240
A man wouldn't do it.

298
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,367
Only a thing would.

299
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,954
- A sneaky, booze-guzzling,
yellow-bellied rat —
- Now —

300
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,249
with a bottle for a brain and a streak of spit
where his spine ought to be.

301
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,294
- That's enough, Corporal!
- You've got yourself into a mess, Lieutenant.

302
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,589
Oh, I have, have I?
Well, you've got yourself in a worse one.

303
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:26,427
First, general insubordination.
Second, threatening your superior officer.

304
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,681
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

305
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,392
Now, how do you think those charges
are gonna look on paper?

306
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,728
Not half as bad as these.

307
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,773
Endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness.

308
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,524
Drunk on duty.

309
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,902
Want on murder of one of your own men...

310
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,654
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

311
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:52,536
Philippe, have you ever tried to bring charges
against an officer?

312
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,331
It's my word against yours, you know.

313
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,541
And whose word do you think
they're gonna believe?

314
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,627
Or l-let me put it another way.

315
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,588
Whose word do you think
they're going to accept?

316
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,174
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

317
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,219
So far, all I have written in this report...

318
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,639
is that you and Lejeune
were killed while out on patrol.

319
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,933
I'll fix this to read
that you made your way back...

320
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,893
after becoming separated
during the skirmish.

321
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,230
- That'll end the matter once and for all.
- You killed Lejeune.
You know that, don't you?

322
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,732
- I'm sorry. It was an accident.
- You threw that grenade and killed him.

323
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,902
I'd give anything in the world if it hadn't
have happened, and that's the truth.

324
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,656
Honestly, I know you don't like me,
but what kind of a man do you think I am?

325
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,244
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

326
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,329
I've been waiting for your report,
Lieutenant.

327
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,498
Well, I think we found out
a thing or two.

328
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,085
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

329
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,421
- How'd it happen?
- It's all right here in the report, sir.

330
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,590
- Well, let's have it.
- Oh, it isn't quite finished yet, sir.

331
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,926
That's all, Corporal.
You did a good night's work.

332
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,471
Should feel very proud of yourself.
Go get some sleep.

333
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,515
Yes, sir.

334
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,313
- How'd you lose Lejeune?
- Machine gun fire, sir.

335
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,066
He coughed.
Almost got us all killed.

336
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,736
Finish that report
and get it to my dugout immediately.

337
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,738
Yes, sir.

338
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,872
The artillery starts at 051 5.

339
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:22,084
First Battalion will move out at 05:30.

340
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,420
When the leading elements
have cleared the German wires...

341
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,214
the second wave, consisting of
the Second and Third Battalions —

342
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,968
minus two companies in reserve —
will move out...

343
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,471
in no case later than 05:40.

344
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,641
Well, that's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

345
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,021
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery preparation
all that we can expect?

346
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:46,609
The feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organized.

347
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,903
What's weather supposed to be like
tomorrow, sir?

348
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,031
Too good.

349
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,866
No chance of rain or fog?

350
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,578
The forecast is for sun all day.

351
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:02,082
If, uh — Perhaps I should say
when we take the Anthill...

352
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,085
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

353
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,548
Well, General Mireau, who, by the way,
will be personally observing the attack...

354
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,593
has promised us support from the 72nd
by sundown tomorrow...

355
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,180
which means, ofcourse,
that we'll have to hold all day.

356
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,308
Are there any more questions?

357
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,024
Well, gentlemen, good luck, and I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

358
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,068
Let's get some sleep.

359
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,073
I'm not afraid
ofdying tomorrow, only ofgetting killed.

360
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,824
That's as clear as mud.

361
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,953
Which would you rather be done in by,
a bayonet or a machine gun?

362
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,664
- Oh, a machine gun, naturally.
- Naturally. That'sjust my point.

363
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,874
They're both pieces of steel
ripping into your guts.

364
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,794
Only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

365
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,212
What does that prove?

366
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,423
That proves that most of us are more afraid
of getting hurt than of getting killed.

367
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,175
Look at Bernard.

368
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,303
He panics when it comes to gas,
but gas doesn't bother me a bit.

369
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,723
He's seen photos of gas cases.
Doesn't mean anything to me.

370
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,227
But I'll tell you something though — I'd hate
like the devil to be without my tin hat.

371
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,188
But on the other hand, I don't mind
not having a tin hat for my tail.

372
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,232
- Why's that?
- You ought to. That's where your brains are.

373
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,193
Because I know a wound to the head
will hurt much more than one in the tail.

374
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,988
The tail is just meat,
but the head — ah, the head is all bone.

375
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,448
- Ah, speak foryourself.
- Tell me this.

376
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,034
Aside from the bayonet,
what are you most afraid of?

377
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,328
- High explosives.
- Exactly! And it's the same with me.

378
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,415
Because — Because I know that it can
chew you up worse than anything else.

379
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,458
Look, it'sjust like I'm trying to tell you.

380
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,044
If you're really afraid of dying, you'd be
living in a funk all the rest of your life...

381
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,505
because you know you've got
to go someday, any day.

382
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,008
And besides, if it's death
that you're really afraid of...

383
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,302
why should you care about
what it is that kills you?

384
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:40,681
Ah, you're too smart for me, Professor.
All I know is nobody wants to die.

385
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,526

Through to Division, sir. Through to Polygon.

386
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,363
Everything quiet.
All units report themselves ready.

387
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,116
Zero-minus two.

388
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,118
May I offeryou gentlemen some cognac?

389
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,203
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

390
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,876
- After you, sir.

391
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,671
To France.

392
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,799


393
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,719


394
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,059


395
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,149


396
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:36,487


397
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,816
Minus 15, 14...

398
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,235
13, 12...

399
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,362
11 , 10...

400
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,490
nine, eight, seven...

401
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,577
six, five, four...

402
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,371
three, two, one...

403
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,041
- zero!

404
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,920

405
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,715

406
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,513

407
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:58,921

408
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,342

409
00:30:13,144 --> 00:32:06,214

410
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,094
- Sergeant, where's "B" Company?
- I don't know, sir.

411
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,058

412
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,518
- Where in heaven's name are they?
- On the left, sir.

413
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,270
Where are the rest?

414
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,856
Zero-plus one, and they're still
in the trenches. They're not advancing.

415
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,651
- Yes, sir.
- Miserable cowards. They're not advancing!

416
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,737
The barrage is getting away from them!
They're still in the trenches!

417
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,739
Yes, sir.

418
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,868
- Captain Nichols.
- Yes, sir?

419
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,830
Order the 75s to commence firing
on our own positions.

420
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:44,628
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

421
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,130
No, sir, but I respectfully ask to —

422
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,550
Captain, do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order?

423
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,595
- No, sir.
- Then carry it out, Captain.

424
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,681
Yes, sir.

425
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,479
Hello, Polygon. This is Division.

426
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,401
Batteries 1 and 2 commence firing...

427
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:12,531
on coordinates 32-58-78.

428
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,158
Batteries 1 and 2 to commence firing...

429
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:20,330
on coordinates 32-58-78. Over.

430
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,009
General, the battery commander reports
those are our own positions.

431
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,178
- He says it must be a mistake.
- Confirm the order, Captain.

432
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,807
Yes, sir. There is no mistake.
The order is confirmed.

433
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,686
Battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order...

434
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,523
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general. Over.

435
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:50,944
General, battery commander respectfully
reports he cannot execute such an order...

436
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,030
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general.

437
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,449
- Give me that phone!
- Yes, sir.

438
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,998
- General Mireau speaking!
- Battery commander speaking, sir.

439
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,500
The troops are mutinying,
refusing to advance.

440
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,544
Fire as ordered until further notice!

441
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,381
With all respect, sir, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men...

442
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:15,052
unless you are willing to take full
and undivided responsibility for it.

443
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,596
Captain Rousseau,
are you going to obey my order?

444
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,224
I must have a written order
before I can execute such a command, sir.

445
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,727
Supposing you're killed.
Then where will I be?

446
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,147
You'll be in front ofa firing squad
tomorrow morning! That's where you'll be!

447
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,860
Hand overyour command and report yourself
under arrest to my headquarters!

448
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,831
Roget!

449
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,834
Lieutenant Roget!
Why are your men still in here?

450
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,045
It was impossible, sir.
Major Vignon is dead.

451
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,298
Get these men out ofthe trenches!
Come on!

452
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:57,094
Let's get ready for another try!
Get these men out of here!

453
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,179
I've tried three times.
Look at all the casualties.

454
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,807
All right! Let's give it another try!

455
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,601
Come on! Let's give it another try!

456
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,521

457
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,691

458
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,615
It's impossible, sir.
All the men are falling back.

459
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,496
Sir, I respectfully submit to the colonel —

460
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,376
Pardon, your remarks to me
were very unfair, sir.

461
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,046
It's just impossible! It's just impossible.

462
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,883
General, according to first reports,
the attack has failed all along the line.

463
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,427
The men are falling back to our own trenches.

464
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:44,307
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for
the immediate reliefofthe 701 st Regiment.

465
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,311
Have them sent to the Château d'Aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to my headquarters.

466
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,356
- Yes, sir.
- Major Couderc, assemble
a general court-martial.

467
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,067
Have it ready to meet
at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

468
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:58,238
If those little sweethearts won't face
German bullets, they'll face French ones!

469
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,959
I ordered an attack.

470
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,003
Your troops refused to attack.

471
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,505
Our troops did attack, sir,
but they could make no headway.

472
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,049
Because they didn't try, Colonel.
I saw it myself.

473
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,135
Half of your men never left the trenches.

474
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,096
A third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense.

475
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,432
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

476
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,561
The fact remains that a good part ofyour men
never left their own trenches.

477
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,481
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 1 0 men
from each company in your regiment...

478
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,526
tried under penalty ofdeath for cowardice.

479
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,945
- Penalty ofdeath?
- For cowardice!

480
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,239
They have skimmed milk in their veins
instead of blood.

481
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,326
Then it's the reddest milk I've ever seen.
My trenches are soaked
with that red skimmed milk.

482
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,454
-That's just about enough out of you, Colonel!
-I'm not gonna mince words
and stand on protocol —

483
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,415
Colonel Dax, ifyou continue in this manner,
I shall have to place you under arrest.

484
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,501
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it rather bluntly.

485
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,463
This is not a trial,
but it does bear certain aspects of one.

486
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,925
And Colonel Dax, technically,
is cast in the role ofthe defense.

487
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,760
In view ofthe gravity of the charges...

488
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,679
a court of law would grant him
all possible latitude in presenting his case.

489
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,058
Latitude is one thing.
Insubordination another.

490
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:12,354
I am merely offering an opinion, General.
Please do not feel constrained to accept it.

491
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:16,274
I am perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

492
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,903
I'm sorry, sir.
I certainly didn't intend to be insubordinate.

493
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,114
My only aim is to remind you
ofthe heroism these men have shown...

494
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,242
on every occasion in the past.

495
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,245
We're not talking about the past.
We're talking about the present.

496
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,413
But don't you see, sir?
They're not cowards.

497
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,042
So if some ofthem didn't leave the trenches,
it must have been because it was impossible.

498
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:38,338
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

499
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,633
We can't leave it up to the men
to decide when an order is possible or not.

500
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,594
If it was impossible,
the only proof of that...

501
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,181
would be their dead bodies
lying at the bottom of the trenches.

502
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,433
They're scum, Colonel.

503
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,477
The whole rotten regiment —

504
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,230
a pack ofsneaking, whining,
tail-dragging curs.

505
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:59,985
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

506
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,946
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

507
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,490
- Then why not shoot the entire regiment?

508
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,952
- I'm perfectly serious.
- Now, Colonel, you're missing
the point entirely.

509
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,664
We don't want to slaughter the French army.
All we want to do is to set an example.

510
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,208
Oh, well, if it's an example you want,
then take me.

511
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,711
- Take you?
- Yes, sir, if it's an example you want...

512
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,713
one man will do as well as a hundred.

513
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:24,050
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

514
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,178
Come now, Colonel.
I think you're overwrought.

515
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,889
This is not a question ofofficers.

516
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,059
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

517
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,769
Suppose wejust make it a dozen.

518
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,940
I was talking ofa hundred men,
and now we're down to 12.

519
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,401
Paul, let's not haggle over this thing anymore!

520
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,571
Let's get it settled once and for all
so that we can all live with it.

521
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:51,578
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see properjustice meted out.

522
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,872
I've spent my entire life in the army.

523
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,291
I've always tried to be true to my principles.

524
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,170
That's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

525
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,422
I'll settle for this —

526
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,176
have the company commanders
select one man from each company
in the first wave...

527
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,178
three in all.

528
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,221
Well, that's very reasonable of you, Paul.

529
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,641
The court-martial will meet
at the château at 3:00 this afternoon.

530
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,811
- Will that be convenient foryou, General?
- I won't be there, Paul.

531
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,271
You won't be there?

532
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,774
No, I think it best
that you handle this matter on your own.

533
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,527
- Probably so.
- General Mireau.

534
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,656
If it's at all possible, I'd like
to be appointed counsel for the accused.

535
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,700
I'll take the matter into consideration.

536
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,786
I think we can permit that, can't we, Paul?
Of course we can.

537
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,579
- Consider it settled, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

538
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:38,750
Well, noon straight up, Paul.

539
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,752
I hope that you can stay
for lunch, Colonel.

540
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,254
George, I'm afraid the colonel
won't have time.

541
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,883
Don't deny it, Paul. You've been hiding
this man, keeping him for your own.

542
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,885
I think that was very selfish of you.

543
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:53,014
Thank you for your courtesy, General,
but I'm afraid there isn't much time
between now and 3:00.

544
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,559
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

545
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,645

546
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,791
- Yes, Captain? What is it?
- You ordered me to report to you here, sir.

547
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,877
- Captain Rousseau, battery commander, sir.
- Yes, yes, of course.

548
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,756
I wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short.

549
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,008
I haven't time to go into it now.

550
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,261
Report back to your command
until further orders.

551
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,263
- Yes, sir.

552
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,226
- Bad stuff. Demoralizes the men.
- I quite agree with you.

553
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,020
And the best solution
is to shelve him to another outfit.

554
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,314
A court of inquiry
ought to roast him a bit first.

555
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,942
Well, in cases like this —
shells falling short —

556
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,027
I — I always try to avoid an inquiry.

557
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,322
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

558
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,908
No, shelving will be the best discipline
for him, in my opinion.

559
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,953
- Well, perhaps you're right.
- Oh, uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

560
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,164
A regimental matter
I want to mention to the colonel.

561
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,749
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

562
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,795
That will be Captain Sancy,
Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

563
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,798
- Yes, sir.
- Have them meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour.

564
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,800
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel Dax.

565
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,596
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like a word with you.

566
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,890
Certainly, sir.

567
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,642
Let's be sensible about this.

568
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,978
Sensible, sir?

569
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,813
Listen to me, Dax.

570
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,649
Drop this fancy talk with me, understand?

571
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,570
General Broulard seems to think
you're funny. I don't.

572
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,866
- Now, I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon, sir. Is that an order?

573
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,578
Colonel Dax, when this mess is cleaned up,
I'll break you.

574
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,165
I'll find an excuse
and I'll breakyou to the ranks. I'll ruin you.

575
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,167
And it'll bejust what you deserve...

576
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,170
showing such little loyalty
to your commanding officer.

577
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,255
That's all, Colonel.

578
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,278
Detail, halt!

579
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,907
General Mireau feels that the attack
on the Anthill yesterday morning failed...

580
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:19,202
because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the First Battalion.

581
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,579
Each ofyou is to select
one man from your company...

582
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,708
place him under arrest and have him ready
to appear before a general court-martial...

583
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,211
no later than 1 500 hours this afternoon.

584
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,630
The charge is cowardice
in the face ofthe enemy.

585
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,800
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

586
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,239
But Lieutenant Roget
killed Lejeune on that patrol...

587
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,575
and then blackmailed me
into keeping quiet about the whole thing!

588
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,160
- That's why he picked me.
- Corporal, I understand your feelings.

589
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,038
But that story has nothing to do
with the charges you're being tried for.

590
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:08,167
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do, but who else will?

591
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,587
You've got no witnesses.

592
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,591
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonize the court.

593
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,136
When we get clear of this,
I'm going into the story of that patrol again.

594
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,015
Sir, in my case, Captain Renouart
had the sergeant draw lots.

595
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,559
I was picked purely by chance.

596
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,936
You're lucky. Look at me.

597
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:31,441
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

598
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,860
Me, a social undesirable, Colonel.

599
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,280
- I didn't act like a coward.
Picking by lots — is that fair?
- Neither did I! Major Vignon —

600
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,491
Gentlemen! You've all
got to understand that the reason
you were picked is immaterial.

601
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,245
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

602
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,126
Stick to the stories you've told me...

603
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,420
and don't let the prosecutor
shake you out of them.

604
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,799
Now remember, you'll be soldiers
in the presence of superior officers.

605
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,678
So act like what you are — soldiers.

606
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,139
And brave ones at that.

607
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,224
Now, I've been in the room
you'll be sitting in.

608
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,310
The afternoon sun will be in your faces...

609
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:11,189
so don't let it seem as if you're
dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

610
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,776
When you answer questions,
look thejudges in the eye.

611
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,820
Don't whine, plead or make speeches.
That's myjob.

612
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,822
Simple statements — short...

613
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,949
but make them so they can be heard
all over the room.

614
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,576
And try not to repeat yourselves.

615
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,662
I'll do that f oryou when I sum up.

616
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,205
Now, we haven't much time.

617
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,333
The court-martial begins in about an hour,
and I've got notes to look at.

618
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,671
Good luck.

619
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,714
- Thank you, sir.
- Colonel, sir.

620
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,766
On the left, ho!

621
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,689
Detail, halt!

622
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,025
Prisoners, right heel!

623
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:07,078
On the left, ho!

624
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,625
Left face!

625
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,299
The court-martial is open.
The prisoners may be seated.

626
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,641
This is a general court-martial.

627
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,603
We shall therefore dispense
with unnecessary formalities.

628
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:36,274
These men are charged
with cowardice in the face of the enemy...

629
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,359
and will be tried for that offense.

630
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:43,448
- Mr. Prosecutor.
- Call the accused — Private Ferol.

631
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,450
Mr. President.

632
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:49,412
Will the prosecutor question the witnesses
without even reading the indictment?

633
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,082
Please don't take up the court's time
with technicalities.

634
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,294
The indictment is lengthy,
and there's no point in reading it.

635
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,213
The defense has a right to know
the exact accusations —

636
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,258
The indictment is that the accused showed
cowardice in the face ofthe enemy...

637
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,510
during the attack on the Anthill.

638
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,555
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

639
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,391
Call the accused — Private Ferol.

640
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,279
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir?

641
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,865
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Anthill?

642
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,658
Yes, sir.

643
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,704
- Did you refuse to advance?
- No, sir.

644
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,749
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

645
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,751
How far did you advance?

646
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,129
To about the middle
of no-man's-land, sir.

647
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,423
Then what did you do?

648
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,425
There were machine-gun bullets
landing all around.

649
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,886
Answer the question.
What did you do?

650
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,349
Well, I saw that me and Meyer, sir —

651
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,559
I didn't ask you what you saw.

652
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,563
The court has no concern
with your... visual experiences.

653
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,108
- My what, sir?
- Prisoner will reply to the question.

654
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,110
Yes, sir. What question was it?

655
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,823
You advanced to the middle of 
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

656
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,659
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

657
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,410
I went back, sir.

658
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:16,374
In other words, Private Ferol,
you retreated.

659
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,960
Yes, sir.

660
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,713
That's all.
The accused may return to his seat.

661
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,007
Just a minute.

662
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,719
Mr. President, I'd like
to question the witness if I may.

663
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,223
- Proceed, Colonel.
- Thank you.

664
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,393
Now, Private Ferol, when you reached
the middle of no-man's-land...

665
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,646
- were you alone with Private Meyer?
- Yes, sir.

666
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,940
Well, what happened to the rest
of your company?

667
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,359
Well, I don't know, sir.

668
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,444
I guess the rest of them
had been killed or wounded.

669
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,532
And you found yourself in the middle
of no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

670
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,950
Yes, sir.

671
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,785
Why didn't you attack the Anthill
single-handed?

672
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,956

673
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,876
Why didn't you storm the Anthill alone?

674
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,588
Just me and Meyer?
You're kidding, sir.

675
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,715
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.

676
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,508
Thank you. That's all.

677
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,303
I don't see the point
of this line of questioning.

678
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,597
Well, I'm attempting to indicate, sir...

679
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:16,767
the utter absurdity of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

680
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,853
Mr. Prosecutor.

681
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:23,357
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated.

682
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,235
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

683
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,156
I knew we should've took Anthill,
but we came on back.

684
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,744
That's all.

685
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,331
The accused may return to his seat.

686
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,595
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

687
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:57,433
Yes, sir, until I was ordered
back to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

688
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,602
How far did you advance?

689
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,604
Into the wire, sir.

690
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:05,399
The, uh, enemy wire, I suppose.

691
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,485
No, sir. It was our wire.

692
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:14,200
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

693
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,243
No, sir, I didn't.

694
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:20,998
How far would you say that was?
How many meters?

695
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,709
Well, I advanced as far as I could.

696
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,962
How many meters?

697
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,214
Not many.

698
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,343
"Not many."

699
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:40,309
Now, Private Arnaud,
before you were ordered back...

700
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,728
did you urge your fellow soldiers forward?

701
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,650
Most of them were dead or wounded before
they got three steps beyond the trenches.

702
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,193
Reply to the question.

703
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,862
I didn't urge them on. No, sir.

704
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,451
Thank you.

705
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,918
Private Arnaud —

706
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,004
At ease, please.

707
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:13,259
Aside from your sad failure to give throat
to spirited battle cries...

708
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,470
was your behavior different in any respect
from that of the other men in your company?

709
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,348
Objection. That's a matter of conjecture.

710
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,642
Sustained.

711
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,523
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

712
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,983
No, sir.

713
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,485
Is it true that you've been
designated a coward...

714
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,405
simply and purely because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

715
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,366
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see that that's significant.

716
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,245
It's accepted practice in the French army
to pick examples by lot.

717
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,873
And since this entire company
advanced only a few meters...

718
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,876
picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case.

719
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,712
Well, I'd like to point out that this soldier
has distinguished himself ...

720
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,339
in some of the bloodiest battles
of the war.

721
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,134
With the court's permission...

722
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,721
I'll read citations f or bravery
that he's already earned on two occasions.

723
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,434
First, citations in the Orders in the Army
for bravery —

724
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,019
That's immaterial, Colonel.

725
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,063
The accused is not being tried
for his former bravery...

726
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,148
but for his recent cowardice.

727
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,317
Medals are no defense.

728
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,447
May I call witnesses to his character?

729
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,282
You may not.

730
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:21,994
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

731
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,749
Mr. President,
no one in the entire regiment...

732
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,919
got anywhere near the German wire,
including myself .

733
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,838
Call the next accused...

734
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,132
if you're through, Colonel.

735
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,802
Thank you.

736
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,845
Prisoner may return to his seat.

737
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:52,108
So you never even left the trenches.

738
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,528
- No, sir.
- That's all.

739
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:00,741
Corporal Paris,
why didn't you leave the trenches?

740
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:06,122
Major Vignon was shot, and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

741
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,959
And were you lying unconscious
in the trenches during the entire attack?

742
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,794
Yes, sir.

743
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,380
That's all.

744
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,423
Have you any witnesses to that?

745
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:20,511
No, sir. I guess everybody
was too busy to notice me.

746
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,471
And there were so many others
lying dead anyway.

747
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,641
- But you have no witnesses.
- No, sir.

748
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,478
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

749
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,772
That could have been self-inflicted later.

750
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,610
- Thank you. You may stand down.

751
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,410
Mr. Prosecutor,
you can make your plea now.

752
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,584
Gentlemen of the court...

753
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,796
this case speaks for itself .

754
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,341
All of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

755
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:05,306
And I submit that that attack...

756
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,186
was a stain on the flag of France...

757
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,688
a blot on the honor...

758
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,941
of every man, woman and child
in the French nation.

759
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,866
It is to us that the sad, distressing...

760
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,620
repellant duty falls, gentlemen.

761
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:33,959
I ask this court
to find the accused guilty...

762
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,592
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the Code of Military Justice.

763
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,389
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

764
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,018
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

765
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,572
Gentlemen of the court,
there are times when I'm ashamed...

766
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,282
to be a member of the human race...

767
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,618
and this is one such occasion.

768
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:13,499
It's impossible for me to summarize
the case for the defense...

769
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,461
since the court never allowed me
a reasonable opportunity to present my case.

770
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,464
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

771
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,261
Yes, sir.

772
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,097
I protest against being prevented
from introducing evidence...

773
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,725
that I consider vital to the defense.

774
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,602
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

775
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,983
There has never been a written indictment
ofcharges made against the defendants.

776
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,777
And lastly, I protest against the fact...

777
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:45,030
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

778
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:59,336
The attack yesterday morning
was no stain on the honor of France...

779
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,383
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

780
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:09,680
But this court-martial is such a stain
and such a disgrace.

781
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:13,726
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

782
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,478
Gentlemen of the court...

783
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,231
to find these men guilty...

784
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,485
would be a crime
to haunt each of you...

785
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,571
till the day you die.

786
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:34,038
I can't believe
that the noblest impulse of man —

787
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,124
his compassion for another—
can be completely dead here.

788
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,587
Therefore, I humbly beg you...

789
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,966
show mercy to these men.

790
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,392
The accused will be escorted
back to the guardroom.

791
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,394
The hearing is closed.

792
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,980
The court will now retire to deliberate.

793
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,982
There will be a guard of six men under arms —

794
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,569
rifles loaded, bayonets fixed —
two men to each prisoner.

795
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:08,030
Any sign oftrouble,
the prisoners will be instantly covered.

796
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:12,034
And if the trouble doesn't subside at once,
the prisoner will be shot on the spot.

797
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,454
Everything must go off without a hitch
with the least possible delay...

798
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,456
but it shouldn't be hurried.

799
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,500
There must be no fumbling around.

800
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,586
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible...

801
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,798
for any lack oforder or for any mistakes.

802
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:30,844
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame — and with interest —

803
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,138
to any one of you who fails in his duties.

804
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:39,645
Execution will take place at 7:00
according to the verdict of the court-martial.

805
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,109
Detail, attention! Dismissed!

806
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,125
This is compliments of General Mireau.

807
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,335
- Duck.
- Well, tell him thanks.

808
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,421
Oh, don't blame me, soldier.

809
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,549
Hey, ugly, what are we supposed
to eat this with — our fingers?

810
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,428
The guard says you can't have
any knives or forks.

811
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,596
Is this supposed to be
our last meal or something?

812
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,392
It isn't "supposed to be" our last meal.
It is our last meal.

813
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,061
Hey, this duck is terrific.

814
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,480
You suppose they put anything in the food?

815
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,566
First they poison us, then they shoot us?

816
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,821
I think they put something in it.

817
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,823
Like what?

818
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:37,035
Like, uh — Like something
or make us groggy or something.

819
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,204
What would be wrong with that
if they did?

820
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,916
Maybe nothing foryou,
but I'm gonna get out of this somehow...

821
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,418
and I don't wanna be drugged.

822
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:47,588
How are you gonna get out —
chew your way through that stone wall?

823
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,131
Arnaud.

824
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,717
Colonel Dax, he'll-he'll —
he'll see us through.

825
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,097
Listen, we gotta get out of here. They're
gonna kill us in a few hours if we don't.

826
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,892
- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's gotta be a way.

827
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,313
How many guards
you think they've got out there?

828
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,357
They may have a couple of squads.
That's what it sounded like this morning.

829
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,944
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the Third Battalion.

830
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:14,364
Anyway, right now, we have no friends.

831
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,326
Why kid yourself?
We're not gonna get out ofthis.

832
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,413
Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

833
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,123
You see that cockroach?

834
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,878
Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead
and it'll be alive.

835
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,839
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

836
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,177
- I'll be nothing, and it'll be alive.

837
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,221
Now you got the edge on 'im.

838
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,270
Good evening, my sons.
I'm Father Dupree.

839
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,484
Is there any news?

840
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,445
Yes. I'm afraid I bring you
very bad news.

841
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,406
You must prepare yourselves for the worst.
Colonel Dax asked me to tell you so.

842
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,824
Oh, mercy! No!

843
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,285
He's been in telephone contact
with army headquarters...

844
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,456
but unable to speak to General Broulard
or, for that matter, to anyone in authority.

845
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,876
- Same way at Division.
No one wants to be found.

846
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,629
- How much time do we have?
- You have plenty oftime yet.

847
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,131
Certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves.

848
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,009
- In nomine Patris...
- In the name of the Father —

849
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,388
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

850
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,223
Amen.

851
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,809

852
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,148

853
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,234
Father, will you take
this letter for me, please?

854
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,361
- Of course, my son.
- It's to my wife.

855
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:37,322
She won't understand this,
and I tried to explain it to her.

856
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,449
I'll see that she gets it.

857
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,411
Do you want me to hearyour confession?

858
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,664
Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

859
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,626
I know you're trying to help,
and I appreciate it...

860
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,462
but if I started praying now,
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

861
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,631
Oh, that's an error, my son.

862
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,175
God is always ready
to listen to your prayers.

863
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,306
All right, Father.

864
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,850
- Will you please hear my confession now?
- Yes.

865
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,104
Have faith in your Creator, my son.

866
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,231
Death comes to us all.

867
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,233
In the name ofthe Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

868
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,695
That's really deep.
"Death comes to us all."

869
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,072
That really is deep.

870
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,700
Say, Ferol, what's the matter—
afraid your luck isn't going to hold out?

871
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,869
Well, look. This is — This is my religion.

872
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,539
O Great Bottle, forgive me my sins,
for now I lay me down to sleep, Bo peep.

873
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,916
May I drink of you first?
Thank you. Amen.

874
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,294
I understand your anguish, my son...

875
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,421
but you must not let it
harden your heart.

876
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,590
May I tell you something, Father?

877
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,842
Back in my hometown,
there was a certain little café...

878
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,303
with an amusing sign over the bar.

879
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,556
It read, "Do not be afraid
to ask for credit...

880
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,808
for our way of refusing is very polite."

881
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,436
- Come on, Arnaud, sit down. You're drunk.
- Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

882
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,896
Come on. Come on, sit down.

883
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,732
And you, get out of here
with your sanctimonious pat answers.

884
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,734
What are you hanging around for —
to torture us?

885
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,654
- No. To help you with all my power.
- Your power? You have no power!

886
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,739
- Come on, Arnaud, take it easy.
- No, but God has power.

887
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,033
- Does he? What a laugh!
- You can be saved.

888
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,868
Saved? I'll be saved!

889
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,248
Cut it out, Arnaud!

890
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,250
Arnaud!

891
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,336
Arnaud.

892
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,552
Father, get a doctor. Quick.

893
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,731
That should keep him quiet long enough.

894
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,693
That's a nasty skull fracture though.
He may not live out the night.

895
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,695
What are we supposed
to do with him?

896
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,448
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher
so that he won't slip when you tilt it vertically.

897
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,451
Surely they won't execute a man
in that condition.

898
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,453
I'm sorry, Father.
The sentence will be carried out.

899
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,956
I've already checked
with the general on it.

900
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,958
If he's still alive in the morning...

901
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,293
pinch his cheeks a couple oftimes
before you take him out on the field.

902
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,171
It may make him open his eyes.
The general wants him to be conscious.

903
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,174
- Yes?

904
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,763
- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in, come in.

905
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,851
Sergeant Boulanger said
that you wanted to see me, sir.

906
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,644
Yes, Lieutenant.

907
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,231
Looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant thing
on our hands in a few hours, doesn't it?

908
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,067
- You mean the execution, sir.
- Yes, I mean the execution.

909
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,236
Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.

910
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,531
Oh, very unfortunate.
That's just how I feel about it.

911
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,533
None of us are happy about it, sir.

912
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:30,078
How'd you happen to pick Corporal Paris?

913
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,790
- Well, I — I had to pick somebody, sir.
- That's right. You did.

914
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,418
Of course, you had no personal motive
in picking Paris, did you?

915
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,670
Oh, no, sir.

916
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,964
You picked him because
he was a coward, didn't you?

917
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,511
- Well, did you or didn't you?
- Oh, yes, sir, I did.

918
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,181
Well —

919
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:52,058
Like you say,
somebody had to be picked.

920
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:55,771
- Oh, it was quite a problem, sir.
- Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

921
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,690
I have to pick someone to be in charge
of the firing squad tomorrow.

922
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,859
Do you have any objections
to taking the job?

923
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,738
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

924
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,950
- Well —
- What's the  matter? Don't you feel well?

925
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,119
Well, no — Yeah, I-I feel all right, sir.

926
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,538
- It's just that I —
- Is it too hot in here?

927
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,208
- Would you like me to open a window?
- No, sir. No, sir.

928
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:21,546
We ll, it's — It's just that I've  neve r be en
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

929
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,758
Oh, there's nothing to it.

930
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,177
First, you help the sergeant
tie the men to the posts.

931
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:29,221
Of course , you offer the men blindfolds.

932
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,307
And, we ll, if they want them,
you tie them on, see ?

933
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,476
Now, you — you take your position
with the firing squad...

934
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,813
you raise your sword —
"Ready, aim, fire."

935
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,942
Then you draw your revolver out,
you walk forward...

936
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,319
and put a bullet
through each man's head.

937
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,990
Sir, I request that I be excused
from this duty.

938
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,243
Request denied.

939
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,245
- Colonel, I —
- You've got thejob.

940
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,247
It's all yours.
That's all, Lieutenant.

941
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,499
- Colonel, if you could just —
- That's all, Lieutenant!

942
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,168
- Yes?

943
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,463
- Excuse me, sir. Colonel Dax?
- Yes.

944
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,132
My name is Rousseau, sir,
Captain ofArtillery.

945
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,426
What is it, Captain?

946
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,102
I have something to tell you, sir, that may
have a great bearing on the court-martial.

947
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,272
Come in, Captain.

948
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,358

949
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,793

950
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,614

951
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,579
- Well, Colonel, good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

952
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:20,582
- Good evening. Come and sit down.
- Thank you, sir. I —

953
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,667
I am really sorry
to intrude on you in this way.

954
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,920
Not at all.
Always delighted to see you, Colonel Dax.

955
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,797
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thankyou, sir, but —

956
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,217
- Well, I —
- I think you'll find it delicious.

957
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,012
I must apologize for not inviting you
to join the party downstairs to night...

958
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:37,098
but I'm afraid that it's, uh,
a dress affair.

959
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:42,604
Well, thank you, sir, but I must confess
that, uh, this is not entirely a social visit.

960
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:47,275
Oh, come, Dax, let's not
go over all that ground again.

961
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,780
Though, uh, I must admit that,
judging from the casualties...

962
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,949
the efforts of your regiment
must have been considerable.

963
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:57,410
Now, how can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

964
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,455
Oh, come, Colonel. You're choosing
to take a rather simple view of this thing.

965
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:04,542
The attack was impossible from the start.
The General Staff must have known that.

966
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,382
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing
a good job running the war.

967
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,384
You must be aware of the fact
that the General Staff...

968
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,554
is subject to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians.

969
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,265
Maybe the attack against the Anthill
was impossible.

970
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,768
Perhaps it was an error of judgment
on our part.

971
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,022
On the other hand, if your men had been
a little more daring, they might have taken it.

972
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,608
Who knows? In any case...

973
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,320
why should we have to bear any more
criticism for failure than we have to.

974
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,991
Aside from the inescapable fact that a good
many of your men never left the trenches...

975
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,618
there's the question of the troops' morale.
Don't forget that.

976
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,578
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

977
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,665
These executions will be a perfect tonic
for the entire division.

978
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,167
There are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating...

979
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,211
than seeing someone else die.

980
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:51,172
- I never thought of that, sir.
- You see, Colo nel, troops are like children.

981
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,676
Just as a child wants his father to be firm,
troops crave discipline.

982
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,219
I see.

983
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,847
And one way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

984
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:02,350
May I ask...

985
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,437
do you sincerely believe
all the things you'vejust said?

986
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,402
It's been a pleasure
discussing this with you, Colonel...

987
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:15,864
but I'm afraid that I'd better
be getting back to my guests.

988
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,324
Forgive me for having kept you
from your party.

989
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,539
Oh, by the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau...

990
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:28,043
ordered his own battery commander,
Captain Rousseau...

991
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,837
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

992
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,422

993
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,053
Well, of course the captain refused
without a written order...

994
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:42,390
but General Mireau demanded that he
commence firing on our own trenches.

995
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,976
Again Rousseau refused
without an order in writing...

996
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:49,189
but again he was ordered,
and again he refused —

997
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:51,191
all in front of witnesses.

998
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:54,069
Do you actually believe
this fantastic story?

999
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:58,239
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved —

1000
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,910
Battery Commander Rousseau,
Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter...

1001
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:05,747
the telephone clerk and, uh,
my own deposition.

1002
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:10,001
What has all this got to do with the charge
against the condemned prisoners?

1003
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,755
A general in a tantrum over the failure
of an impossible attack...

1004
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,341
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

1005
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,428
Now, this same officer on the same day...

1006
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,848
orders a court-martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

1007
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:30,563
General, what would your, uh, newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

1008
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,109
Colonel Dax, are you trying
to blackmail me?

1009
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:38,321
Sir, that's an ugly word,
but you are in a difficult position.

1010
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,323
Too much has happened.
Someone's got to be hurt.

1011
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,408
The only question is who.

1012
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,705
General Mireau's assault
on the Anthill failed...

1013
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,626
and his order to fire on this own troops
was refused.

1014
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,962
But his attempt to murder
three innocent men...

1015
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:58,174
to protect his own reputation
will be prevented by the General Staff.

1016
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,475
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax?

1017
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,978
I've been rude to my guests too long.

1018
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,571

1019
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:30,415

1020
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,508
Detail, halt!

1021
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,594
Order arms!

1022
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,306
Fall out!

1023
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,870

1024
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,917
Courage, my son.
The worst is over.

1025
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,502

1026
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,347
Good morning, Paris.

1027
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,226
Good morning, Sergeant.

1028
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,687
- How are you today?
- Not too bad.

1029
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,773
How are you?

1030
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,693
You missed some good chow
in here last night.

1031
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,779
What'd you have?

1032
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,618
Have you got a drink for us?

1033
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:51,287
Take a swig of this.

1034
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,373

1035
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,961
It just occurred to me —
A funny thing.

1036
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:00,755
I haven't had one sexual thought
since the court-martial.

1037
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,174
It's pretty extraordinary, isn't it?

1038
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,261
- Pull yourself together. Act like a man.

1039
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,596
- Listen, Paris.

1040
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,182
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

1041
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,184
There will be a lot of dignitaries,
newspapermen out there.

1042
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,520
You've got a wife and family.
How do you want to be remembered?

1043
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,730
I don't wanna die.

1044
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,941
Many of us will bejoining you
before this war's over.

1045
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:23,194
I don't care.
I don't wanna die.

1046
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,738
Please save me, Sergeant.

1047
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,449
I can't save you. No one can now.

1048
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,704
This is the last decision
you'll have a chance to make on earth.

1049
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,581
You can pull yourself together, act like a man,
or we'll have to drag you out of here.

1050
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:38,251
In the end, it'll all be the same.
It's up to you.

1051
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,673

1052
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,813
Well, let's get busy.
You and Ferol take your coats off.

1053
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:00,815
It's no use hanging around here.

1054
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:05,028

1055
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,365

1056
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:14,871

1057
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:22,920
...with the help of thy grace
to do penance and to amend my life.

1058
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:27,675

1059
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:31,220
Amen.

1060
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,681
Why do I have to die? For what?

1061
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,726

1062
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,937
Why do I have to die? Why?
I didn't do anything.

1063
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,149
We do not question
the will of God, my son.

1064
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:45,234
But I fought. I fought.

1065
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,612
I fought on the battlefield.

1066
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:51,199
Why don't they die?
Why not put them to death?

1067
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,576
You showed courage
in the face of the enemy, my son.

1068
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,703
Show it now before your own troops.

1069
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,789
But I'm scared. I'm scared.

1070
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,543
Oh, Father, I'm scared. Oh, my God.

1071
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:06,047
Courage. Brace yourself, man.
Brace yourself .

1072
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:08,633

1073
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:17,141
He said, "This day,
thou shalt be with me in paradise."

1074
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,019
- Really, Father?
- Yes.

1075
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,563
Really, Father?

1076
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:27,068
I don't understand why—

1077
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:31,697
I'll never see nobody again, Father. Please.

1078
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,158
Courage, man. Brace yourself.

1079
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,786
- I can't help it.
- Brace yourself.

1080
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,746
I can't help it, Father.

1081
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:41,582
O God, O Almighty God —

1082
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,584
Oh, Christ! Christ!

1083
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,586
Grant courage to this man
who is about to die.

1084
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,839
Strengthen me, God!
Please strengthen me!

1085
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,425

1086
01:13:54,304 --> 01:14:01,936
Why do I have to die, Father?

1087
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,230
About face!

1088
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:06,816

1089
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,993
Secure prisoners!

1090
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,622
Detail, attention!

1091
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,916
Forward march!

1092
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,502

1093
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:37,805
Detail, halt!

1094
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,891
Left face!

1095
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:45,188

1096
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,238
Please don't.
Please choose me to — 

1097
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,548

1098
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:17,386
"In the name of the French People...

1099
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,347
"Corporal Philippe Paris...

1100

01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:34,362

1105
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,781
in accordance with the judgment
of the military court-martial."

1106
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:47,208
Right face!

1107
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,293
Forward hut!

1108

...and blessed are thou amongst women.

1109
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,898
- Do you want a blindfold?
- Blessed art thou —

1110
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,901
Yes, Lieutenant. Please.

1111
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,948

1112
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:22,952
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

1113
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:29,959

1114
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:37,425
Do — Do you want a blindfold?

1115
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:39,468
No.

1116
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,388
I'm sorry.

1117
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:19,300

1118
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,470
Ready!

1119
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,223
Aim!

1120
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:30,269
- Fire!

1121
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,983
I'm awfully glad
you could be there, George.

1122
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,694
This sort ofthing
is always rather grim.

1123
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,072
But this one had a kind ofsplendor to it,
don't you think?

1124
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,574
I have never seen an affair of this sort
handled any better.

1125
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,535
The men died wonderfully.

1126
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,997
There's always that chance
that one ofthem will do something
that will leave everyone with a bad taste.

1127
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,832
This time, you couldn't ask for better.

1128
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,168

1129
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,671
Yes?

1130
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,089
Yes, Colonel?

1131
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,632
You wanted to see me, sir.

1132
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:02,927
Oh, yes, yes.
Come in, Colonel. Come in and sit down.

1133
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:07,431
Oh, Colonel Dax,
your men died very well.

1134
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,021
- Would you like some coffee, Colonel?
- No, thank you, sir.

1135
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,440
Oh, by the way, Paul,
it's been brought to my attention...

1136
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,444
that you ordered your artillery
to fire on your own men
during the attack on the Anthill.

1137
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,156
- I did what?

1138
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:28,661
- Who told you that?
- Colonel Dax came to me last night
with the story.

1139
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:35,209
Colonel Dax, I've always known
that you were a disloyal officer...

1140
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,671
but I never dreamed that you would
stoop to anything so low as this.

1141
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:43,175
General, I have sworn statements
from Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter...

1142
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,178
Captain Rousseau, the battery commander
who refused your order.

1143
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:48,305
I think it's infamous,
absolutely infamous.

1144
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,683
Then there's no truth at all
to the charge made by Colonel Dax?

1145
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:53,060
I don't see how you could
even ask me that.

1146
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,563
You cannot imagine how glad I am
to hear that, Paul.

1147
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:58,232
I'm certain that
you'll come through it all right.

1148
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,818
- I'll come through what?
- There will have to be an inquiry.

1149
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,070
- An inquiry?
- But it won't amount to much.

1150
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,406
- Those things never do. The public forgets.
- "Public"?

1151
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,324
You've got to have the right
to clear your name.

1152
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:11,328
You cannot allow such vile insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

1153
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:14,874
So that's it.

1154
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,085
You're making me the goat —

1155
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,172
the only completely innocent man
in this whole affair.

1156
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:29,096
I have only one last thing
to say to you, George.

1157
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,516
The man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier.

1158
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,692

1159
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,361
Well...

1160
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,363
had to be done.

1161
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,742
France cannot afford to have fools
guiding her military destiny.

1162
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:52,953
I'm grateful to you, Dax, for having
brought this matter to my attention.

1163
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:56,373
Colonel Dax, how would you like
General Mireau'sjob?

1164
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,628
- His what, sir?
- His job.

1165
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:03,339
Let me get this straight, sir.

1166
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,218
You're offering me
General Mireau's command?

1167
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,054
Come, come, Colonel Dax.
Don't overdo the surprise.

1168
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,973
You've been after thejob from the start.
We all know that, my boy.

1169
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:17,603
I may be many things, sir,
but I'm not your boy.

1170
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,481
Well, I certainly didn't mean to imply
any biological relationship.

1171
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,733
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- You trying to provoke me, Colonel?

1172
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,735
- Why should I want to do that, sir?
- Exactly.

1173
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,821
It would be a pity to lose your promotion
before you get it...

1174
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,615
a promotion you have
so very carefully planned for.

1175
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:35,996
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

1176
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,875
Colonel Dax! You will apologize at once,
or I shall have you placed under arrest!

1177
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:45,673
I apologize for not being
entirely honest with you.

1178
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,384
I apologize f or not revealing
my true f eelings.

1179
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,637
I apologize, sir,
for not telling you sooner...

1180
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:54,807
that you're a degenerate,
sadistic old man...

1181
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:58,853
and you can go to hell before I apologize
to you now or ever again!

1182
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:04,608
Colonel Dax, you're a disappointment to me.

1183
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:09,738
You've spoiled the keenness of your mind
by wallowing in sentimentality.

1184
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,866
You really did want to save those men...

1185
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,702
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

1186
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:18,706
You're an idealist, and I pity you
as I would the village idiot.

1187
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,208
We're fighting a war, Dax,
a war that we've got to win.

1188
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,210
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

1189
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:27,214
You bring charges against General Mireau,
so I insist that he answer them.

1190
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,008
Wherein have I done wrong?

1191
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,264
Because you don't know
the answer to that question...

1192
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,019
I pity you.

1193
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,234

1194
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:51,322

1195
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,494

1196
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:06,045

1197
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:08,088
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

1198
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,549
Now, gentlemen, we have a little
special entertainment foryou.

1199
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:13,636

1200
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,721

1201
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,641
Sort of a — sort of a little diversion
as it were.

1202
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:22,186
And as my wife always says,
"What is life without a little diversion?"

1203
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,105

1204
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:29,652
Now, gentlemen, I give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy.

1205
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:32,029

1206
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,448
- From Germany.

1207
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:36,533
The land of the Hun.

1208
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,164

1209
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:50,422

1210
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,844

1211
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:06,021
Gentlemen, a little pearl washed ashore
by the tide ofwar.

1212
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:09,441

1213
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:13,028
Sag den Herrschaften guten Tag.

1214
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,489
- Guten Tag.

1215
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:19,493
Hey! Talk in a civilized language.

1216
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:22,663
- It's true the little lady has her limitations.

1217
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:25,916
As a matter of fact,
she has absolutely no talent at all —

1218
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,837
except, that is,
well, maybe a little natural talent?

1219
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:32,965

1220
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:38,178
The little lady can't dance,
she can't tell any jokes...

1221
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,681
and she can't balance rubber balls
on her little nose.

1222
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:44,393
- Ah, but she can sing like a bird.

1223
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:46,186
She has a throat of gold.

1224
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,647
- Come on, baby!
- Come on, honey! Sing us a song!

1225
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,525
- Come on, honey! How about a song?

1226
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,071

1227
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:58,198

1228
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,993
Come on, baby!
Sing us a song!

1229
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:04,580

1230
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:10,210
Louder! Louder!

1231
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,714

1232
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:23,849
- ♪♪ [Singing "The Faithful Hussar"
in German]

1233
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:55,214

1234
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:32,793

1235
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:13,083


1236
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,679
- Sir.
- Yes, Sergeant?

1237
01:26:25,763 --> 01:26:28,015
We have orders
to move back to the front immediately.

1238
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,020
- Give the men a few minutes more, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

1239
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:37,232

1240
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:53,373

1241
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:48,512
