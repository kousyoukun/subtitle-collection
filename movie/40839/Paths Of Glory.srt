3
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500


4
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,606

Paul, wonderful seeing you again. Really wonderful.

00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,555
I really haven't done very much.

Paul, I've come to see you about something big.
Paul 我这次来是关于一件大事的

00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:02,196
It's top secret and must go no further than your chief of staff...

and not to him unless you can trust his discretion.

- 你笑什么？  - 很抱歉

36
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:17,783
I thought for just a moment I knew what you were going to say. Please go on.
刚刚有一瞬间 我想我知道你要说什么 请继续说吧

37
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,284
I never knew you were a mind reader. What did you think I was about to say?
我从不知道你会读心术 你认为我要说什么？

38
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:24,584
- Something about the "Anthill." - You are a mind reader.
- 跟Ant Hill有关  - 你确实会读心术

39
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:26,591
Well, it is a key position. It's in my sector.
好吧 这是一处要塞 又在我的防区内

40
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:30,501
To be perfectly honest, I've heard some talk.
完全坦白地讲 我听到了一些传言

41
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,897
You know, there's nothing really secret around headquarters.- Well, what do you think? 
- 你知道 总部没有真正的秘密的  - 你怎么看？

42
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,992
- It's the key to the whole German position in this sector.
就整个德军在本防区的布防来看 这处要塞是关键 


43
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,038
They've held on to it for a year now...
他们已经守了一年了

44
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,573
and it looks as though they'll hold on to it for another year if they want to.

45
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,269
Paul, I have formal orders to take the Ant hill no later than the 10th.

46
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:48,006
- That's the day after tomorrow. - That comes pretty close to being ridiculous, don't you think?

47
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:51,642
I don't imagine I'd be here if I really thought that.

48
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:56,246
[Chuckles] Paul, if there's one man in this army who can do this for me, it's you.

49
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,288
It's out of the question, George. Absolutely out of the question.

50
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,384
My division was cut to pieces.

51
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:05,989
What's left of it is in no position to even hold the Ant hill, let alone take it.

52
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:09,193
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

53
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,533
Well, Paul, there was something else I wanted to tell you.

54
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:15,665
However, I'm sure that you'll misunderstand my motives in mentioning it.

55
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:20,406
- What was it? - Oh. You'd be bound to misunderstand.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,972
However, as your friend, maybe I should tell you.

57
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,432
What are you trying to say, George?

58
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,485
Paul, talk around headquarters is that you are being considered for the 12th Corps.

59
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:33,320
- The 12th Corps? 
- Yes, and with that, another star.

60
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,326
Now, I've pushed it all I can.

61
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:38,625
The 12th Corps needs a fighting general, and you're overdue on that star.

62
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,859
Now, we both know that your record is good enough...

63
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,697
for you to refuse this assignment on the grounds you've stated.

64
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,329
No one would question your opinion. They'd simply get someone else to do the job.

65
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:52,367
So you shouldn't let this influence your opinion, Paul.

66
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:57,038
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac? 
- No, thanks, Paul, not before dinner.

67
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:05,183
George, I'm responsible for the lives of 8,000 men.

68
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,989
What is my ambition against that?

69
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,360
What is my reputation in comparison to that?

70
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,899
My men come first of all, George, 

71
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,492
- ...and those men know it too. 
- I know that they do.

72
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,664
You see, George, those men know that I would never let them down.

73
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,401
That goes without saying.

74
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,255
The life of one of those soldiers means more to me... 

75
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:28,035
than all the stars and decorations and honors in France.

76
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:30,945
So...you think 

77
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:34,350
this attack is absolutely beyond the ability of your men at this time?

78
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,753
I didn't say that, George.

79
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,453
Nothing is beyond those men, once their fighting spirit is aroused.

80
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,087
Paul, I don't want to push you into it if you think it's ill-advised.

81
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:47,621
Don't worry, George. You couldn't do that ifyou tried.

82
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:52,368
Of course, artillery would make an enormous difference.

83
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:55,635
- What artillery support can you give me? 
- Well, I'll see.

84
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,767
- What about replacements?
- We'll see what we can do

85
00:05:57,844 --> 00:06:01,075
but I feel sure that you can get along with what you have.

86
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,081
- Might just do it. - [Chuckling] Oh, Paul.

87
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,743
I knew that I was right to come to you. You are the man to take the Ant hill.

88
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:11,078
- Now, as far as that star is concerned ... 
- That had nothing to do with my decision.

89
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,024
- If anything, it would sway me the other way. 

90
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,957
- I realize that perfectly, Paul.

91
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,961
Now, when do you say you see this coming off?

92
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,130
No later than the day after tomorrow. We just might do it.

93
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:46,322
Hello there, soldier. Ready to kill more Germans?

94
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,326
- Yes, sir. 
- What's your name, soldier?

95
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:51,397
Sir, Private Ferol, Company "A." 
- Uh-huh. Are you married, Private? 
- No, sir.

96
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:54,127
- Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you. 
- Yes, sir.

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,692
- Well, carry on, Private, and good luck to you. - [Gunshot Echoes]

98
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,704
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

99
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:06,177
- Good morning, General. 
- Good morning.

100
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:08,179
Hello there, soldier. 

101
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:10,374
Ready to kill more Germans?- Yes, sir.

102
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,383
- Aha! Working over your rifle, I see.

103
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,976
Well, that's the way. It's a soldier's best friend.

104
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,284
You be good to it, and it'll always be good to you.

105
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,290
Yes, sir.

106
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:24,019
[Chuckles] Well, uh, good luck to you, soldier.

107
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,030
- Carry on. - Thankyou, sir.

108
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:54,416
Hello there, soldier.

109
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,961
Ready to kill more Germans?

110
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,157
Well, is everything all right, soldier?

111
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:03,292
All right? Yes, sir, I'm all right.

112
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,836
Aha. Good fellow. 

113
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:09,898
Are you married, soldier?- Married? Me, married? - [Machine Gun Fire]

114
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:13,537
- Yes. Have you got a wife? - A wife? Have I got a wife?

115
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,842
Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

116
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:21,251
I beg your pardon, Sergeant. There is no such thing as shell shock.

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,753
- Have you got a wife, soldier? - My wife?

118
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:27,418
My wife. Yes, I have a wife.

119
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,427
I'm never gonna see her again. I'm gonna be killed.

120
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,963
Get a grip on yourself! You're acting like a coward!

121
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:34,499
- I am a coward, sir. - Snap out of it, soldier!

122
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:38,663
Sergeant, I want you to arrange for the immediate transfer of this baby out of my regiment!

123
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:41,400
I won't have other brave men contaminated by him!

124
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:43,806
- Yes, sir. - Carry on, Sergeant.

125
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:51,075
You were right, sir. This sort of thing can spread if it isn't checked.

126
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,277
You know, General, I'm convinced that these tours of yours...

127
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,946
have an incalculable effect upon the morale of these men.

128
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,957
In fact, I think the fighting spirit of the 701 st derives from it.

129
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:02,859
No, no, Major. That spirit was just born in them.

130
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,698
The general is coming, sir.

131
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,150
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel. - I'm honored, General.

132
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,211
It's our privilege entirely.

133
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:33,281
- Well, quite a neat little spot you have here. - Colonel.

134
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:37,090
I reserve comment on the neatness, sir, but it is little.

135
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,461
- [Laughs] - Pretty shy on seating accommodations though.

136
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:42,831
More than enough for me. I never got the habit of sitting.

137
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:45,632
Like to be on my feet. [Laughs] Keep on the move.

138
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:50,631
I can vouch for that, Colonel. I can hardly get the general behind a desk long enough to sign an order.

139
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,803
Well, that's the way I am, you know, Dax.

140
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:55,813
I can't understand these armchair officers...

141
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:59,977
fellows trying to fight a war from behind a desk... waving papers at the enemy...

142
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:03,249
worrying about whether a mouse is going to run up their pants leg.

143
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:05,624
I don't know, General. If I had the choice between mice 

144
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,927
and Mausers... I think I'd take the mice every time.

145
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:09,986
You'll never make me believe that, Colonel.

146
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:12,587
Seriously though, if a man's a ninny...

147
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,293
let him put on a dress and hide under the bed.

148
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,336
But if he wants to be a soldier, then, by heavens, he's got to be one.

149
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:21,579
He's got to fight, and he can't do that unless he's where the fighting is.

150
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,478
That's my credo. I think I have to agree with you,

151
00:10:25,478 --> 00:10:27,412
presenting your case so convincingly, sir.

152
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,683
And you've never failed to live up to it, sir. - I imagine you'd like a look around, wouldn't you? 

153
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:32,412
- Yes, Colonel.

154
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:34,301
- [Machine Gun Fire] - Well, here's something to see.

155
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,789
The Anthill. About as good a view as you can get without actually being there.

156
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:40,621
[Laughs] Well, that won't be long now, will it?

157
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,358
- [Machine Gun Fire In Distance] - Ah.

158
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,699
Ah. Yeah.

159
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,464
Well, I've seen much more formidable objectives.

160
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,529
Much, much worse.

161
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:03,441
Well, not something we can grab and run away with...

162
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:05,643
but certainly pregnable.

163
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:08,585
- Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it? 
- Why?

164
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:10,918
Well, like something to do with giving birth.

165
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,426
[Chuckling] Oh, yes. Quite. You're right on your toes this morning, Colonel.

166
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,927
Even sharper than usual.But we mustn't forget, 

167
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:20,124
the colonel was perhaps the foremost criminal lawyer in all France.

168
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,033
- Of course, General. - Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

169
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:27,436
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief come off last night?

170
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:30,532
We drew some artillery. Twenty-nine casualties, sir.

171
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:34,670
Yes, I noticed it on the road in. Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

172
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:37,910
All swarmed together like a bunch of flies, just waiting for someone to swat 'em.

173
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,783
[Chuckles] Well, they never learn, it seems.

174
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,411
They get in a tight spot under heavy fire, gang up every time.

175
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,869
Herd instinct, I suppose. Kind of a lower-animal sort of thing.

176
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,327
Kind of a human sort of thing, it seems to me...

177
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,295
or don't you make a distinction between the two, Major?

178
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:53,024
Oh, yes, uh, very regrettable, of course. Very. Yes, indeed.

179
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:57,592
Uh, Major, would you be kind enough to excuse us for a few minutes?

180
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,763
Yes, sir. Of course.

181
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,272
Colonel.

182
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,541
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

183
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,550
- What do I think of what, sir? 
- The Anthill.

184
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:17,555
Colonel, your regiment is going to take the Anthill tomorrow.

185
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:21,393
You know the condition of my men, sir. Oh, naturally, men are going to have to be killed. 

186
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:24,794
Possibly a lot of them.They absorb bullets and shrapnel...

187
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,229
and by doing so make it possible for others to get through.

188
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,564
- What support will we have? 
- I have none to give you.

189
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,395
What sort of casualties do you anticipate, sir?

190
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:39,258
Hmm, say, five percent killed by our own barrage. That's a very generous allowance.

191
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,644
Ten percent more in getting through no-man's-land...

192
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:43,978
and 20% more getting through the wire.

193
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:47,951
That leaves 65% with the worst part of the job over.

194
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,013
Let's say another 25% in actually taking the Anthill.

195
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,117
We're still left with a force more than adequate to hold it.

196
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:58,095
General, you're saying that more than half of my men will be killed.

197
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,927
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel...

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,471
- but we will have the Anthill. 
- But will we, sir? 

199
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:10,033
I'm depending on you, Colonel.All France is depending on you.

200
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:15,113
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

201
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:19,781
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need a flag waved in front of me to get me to charge.

202
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:22,821
I don't think I like your comparison of the flag of France to a bullfighter's cape.

203
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,049
I meant nothing disrespectful to the flag of France, sir.

204
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:28,651
Patriotism may be old-fashioned, but show me a patriot, and I'll show you an honest man.

205
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:32,564
Not everyone has always thought so. Samuel Johnson had something else to say about patriotism.

206
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:33,997
And what was that, may I ask?

207
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,996
- Nothing really. - What you do mean, "Nothing really"?

208
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,540
- Come on, sir, nothing really important. 
- Colonel, when I ask a question, it's always important.

209
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,100
- Now, who was this man? - Samuel Johnson, sir.

210
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,872
All right. Now, what did he have to say about patriotism?

211
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:49,245
He said it was the last refuge of a scoundrel, sir.

212
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,274
I'm sorry. I meant nothing personal.

213
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:55,582
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

214
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:58,046
It's you who are exhausted, not your men.

215
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,466
And it's my fault. I've given you one impossible task after another.

216
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,225
- You need rest. You need it badly. - I haven't said anything about needing rest, sir.

217
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:07,458
And you never would either. Therefore, you're not going to have any say-so about it, Colonel.

218
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:10,229
As from right now, I'm ordering you on indefinite furlough.

219
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:12,896
General, you can't take me away from my men. You can't do that to me, sir.

220
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:16,600
Not to you, Dax. For you. For your good and for the good of your men.

221
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:18,609
The good of my men, sir?

222
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:22,443
If a commanding officer lacks confidence, what can we expect of his men?

223
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:26,644
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you, but I must have your enthusiastic support.

224
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:30,985
Not once have you said that your men can take the Anthill.

225
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:35,955
We'll take the Anthill.

226
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:39,429
If any soldiers in the world can take it...

227
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:41,864
we'll take the Anthill.

228
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:45,267
And when you do, your men will be relieved and get a long rest.

229
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:03,248
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune reporting, sir.

230
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:05,522
You took your time about it. 

231
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:09,561
We prepared as quick as we could, sir.We had to alert the sentries.

232
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:13,332
All right. You men, at ease. This is a reconnaissance patrol ... 

233
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:17,236
German wire, machine gun posts... identification of bodies.

234
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:20,637
There will only be the three of us, and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

235
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:27,008
We go out to the left, and we come back through Post 6 on the right.

236
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,809
- Is everything all clear at Post 6? 
- All the sentries have been warned up to here.

237
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:33,283
Number 6 will send up flares at 10-minute intervals starting at 0400.

238
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:36,219
- I wanted them every five minutes. - I told them that, sir.

239
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:39,655
The sergeant says every five minutes is too much. He says it's certain to draw artillery.

240
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,784
Quite a strategist, this sergeant. What's his name?

241
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,226
I don't know, sir.

242
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,595
All right. You men wait outside. I'll join you in a minute.

243
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,227
Would you mind telling us the password, sir?

244
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:53,771
- Calais. - Yes, sir.

245
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:05,582
- He's fortifying himself. 
- It smelled like heaven.

246
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:08,711
I can always tell when he's had a few. He gets sarcastic.

247
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,688
Well, at least he could have passed it around, the pig.

248
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:14,817
Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

249
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:17,487
We went to school together before the war.

250
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:20,054
He thinks I don't have enough respect for him. He's right.

251
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:24,769
If you gentlemen are ready.

252
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,812
- Colonel. - Everything clear and understood? Yes, sir.

253
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:36,212
The lane through our wire is right out in front here.

254
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,579
Machine guns are pointing at the opening.

255
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,743
- Good luck, men. - Thank you, sir.

256
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:43,219
All right, men. Let's go.

257
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,068
- What's that? - [Paris] I don't know.

258
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,504
Lejeune, move out and look that over. We'll cover you.

259
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:48,944
Split up a night patrol?

260
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:50,948
Move out, Lejeune.

261
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,534
I don't like this. Let's get out of here.

262
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:19,797
We haven't given him enough time.

263
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:28,671
- If we wait any longer, they'll get us too. 
- We've got to wait for him.

264
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,218
[Gasping] He must be dead. Where is he?

265
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,991
Roget!

266
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,715
- Well. - Surprised, Lieutenant?

267
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:41,344
Yes, I am. Happily surprised. I thought you'd been killed.

268
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,286
You didn't wait around to find out, did you, Lieutenant?

269
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:45,846
Now, look here. What do you mean?

270
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:49,189
I mean, you ran like a rabbit after you killed Lejeune.

271
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:52,822
Killed Lejeune? What are you talking about?

272
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:55,366
I don't think I like your tone.

273
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:57,697
You're speaking to an officer. Remember that.

274
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:01,000
[Chuckling] Oh, well, I must be mistaken then, sir.

275
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:03,597
An officer wouldn't do that.

276
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:06,075
A man wouldn't do it.

277
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:08,078
Only a thing would.

278
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:10,080
- A sneaky, booze-guzzling, yellow-bellied rat ... 
- Now ...

279
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:13,852
with a bottle for a brain and a streak of spit where his spine ought to be.

280
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:18,379
- That's enough, Corporal! 
- You've got yourself into a mess, Lieutenant.

281
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,674
Oh, I have, have I? Well, you've got yourself in a worse one.

282
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:26,454
First, general insubordination. Second, threatening your superior officer.

283
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:30,831
Third, refusing to obey an order and inciting others to do the same.

284
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:33,462
Now, how do you think those charges are gonna look on paper?

285
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:35,733
Not half as bad as these.

286
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,799
Endangering the lives of your men through recklessness.

287
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:42,902
Drunk on duty. Wanton murder of one of your own men

288
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:46,042
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

289
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:52,588
Philippe, have you ever tried to bring charges against an officer?

290
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:57,529
It's my word against yours, you know. And whose word do you think they're gonna believe?

291
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,588
Or l-let me put it another way.

292
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,599
Whose word do you think they're going to accept?

293
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:05,158
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

294
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:08,297
So far, all I have written in this report...

295
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:11,900
is that you and Lejeune were killed while out on patrol.

296
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:14,172
I'll fix this to read that you made your way back...

297
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:16,544
after becoming separated during the skirmish.

298
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:19,277
- That'll end the matter once and for all. 
- You killed Lejeune. You know that, don't you?

299
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:21,046
- I'm sorry. It was an accident. 
- You threw that grenade and killed him.

300
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,782
I'd give anything in the world if it hadn't have happened, and that's the truth.

301
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:28,656
Honestly, I know you don't like me, but what kind of a man do you think I am?

302
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,827
- Oh, good morning, Colonel. 
- At ease, men.

303
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,499
- I've been waiting foryour report, Lieutenant. 
- Well, I think we found out a thing or two.

304
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:41,266
- Everything go well? 
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

305
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:43,466
- How'd it happen? 
- It's all right here in the report, sir.

306
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,669
- Well, let's have it. 
- Oh, it isn't quite finished yet, sir.

307
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:48,804
That's all, Corporal. You did a good night's work.

308
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,179
Should feel very proud of yourself. Go get some sleep.

309
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,683
Yes, sir.

310
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:01,387
- How'd you lose Lejeune? 
- Machine gun fire, sir.

311
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:05,395
He coughed. Almost got us all killed.

312
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:07,795
Finish that report and get it to my dugout immediately.

313
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,299
Yes, sir.

314
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:18,072
The artillery starts at 0515.

315
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:22,136
First Battalion will move out at 0530.

316
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:24,408
When the leading elements have cleared the German wires...

317
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:27,280
the second wave, consisting of the Second and Third Battalions ...

318
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:30,788
minus two companies in reserve ... will move out...

319
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:34,814
in no case later than 0540.

320
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:37,691
Well, that's it, gentlemen. Are there any questions?

321
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:42,028
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery preparation all that we can expect?

322
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,594
The feeling is that any more than that will give them too much time to get organized.

323
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,866
What's weather supposed to be like tomorrow, sir?

324
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:51,040
Too good.

325
00:24:52,377 --> 00:24:55,073
No chance of rain or fog?

326
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:57,614
The forecast is for sun all day.

327
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:02,085
[Officer] lf, uh ... Perhaps I should say when we take the Anthill...

328
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:05,122
how long do we have to hold it before we can expect any support?

329
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:09,619
Well, General Mireau, who, by the way, will be personally observing the attack...

330
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:12,561
has promised us support from the 72nd by sundown tomorrow...

331
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,828
which means, of course, that we'll have to hold all day.

332
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:19,328
Are there any more questions?

333
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:27,272
Well, gentlemen, good luck, and I'm sure you'll come through as you always do.

334
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:29,040
Let's get some sleep.

335
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:34,276
[Man Whispering] I'm not afraid of dying tomorrow, only of getting killed.

336
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:37,355
- That's as clear as mud. 
- Which would you rather be done in by, 

337
00:25:37,355 --> 00:25:40,125
- a bayonet or a machine gun?
- Oh, a machine gun, naturally.

338
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,891
Naturally. That's just my point.They're both pieces of steel ripping into your guts.

339
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,760
Only the machine gun is quicker, cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

340
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:48,662
- What does that prove?
- That proves that most of us 

341
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,896
are more afraid of getting hurt than of getting killed.

342
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,304
Look at Bernard. He panics when it comes to gas, but gas doesn't bother me a bit.

343
00:25:56,374 --> 00:25:59,935
He's seen photos of gas cases. Doesn't mean anything to me.

344
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:03,344
But I'll tell you something though ... I'd hate like the devil to be without my tin hat.

345
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:06,009
But on the other hand, I don't mind not having a tin hat for my tail.

346
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,450
- Why's that? - You ought to. That's where your brains are.

347
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,954
Because I know a wound to the head will hurt much more than one in the tail.

348
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:14,082
The tail is just meat, but the head ... ah, the head is all bone.

349
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,491
- Ah, speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

350
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:19,086
Aside from the bayonet, what are you most afraid of?

351
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:21,428
- High explosives. 
- Exactly! And it's the same with me.

352
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:24,434
Because ... Because I know that it can chew you up worse than anything else.

353
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:27,096
Look, it's just like I'm trying to tell you.If you're really afraid of dying,

354
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,197
you'd be living in a funk all the rest of your life...

355
00:26:29,274 --> 00:26:31,504
because you know you've got to go someday, any day.

356
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:33,861
And besides, if it's death that you're really afraid of... 

357
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:36,147
why should you care about what it is that kills you?

358
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:40,709
Ah, you're too smart for me, Professor. All I know is nobody wants to die.

359
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:52,524
[Man] Through to Division, sir. Through to Polygon.

360
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:56,499
Everything quiet. All units report themselves ready.

361
00:26:56,568 --> 00:26:59,196
Zero-minus two.

362
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,204
May I offer you gentlemen some cognac?

363
00:27:01,272 --> 00:27:02,705
- Thank you, General. 
- Thank you, sir.

364
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:08,445
- Afteryou, sir. - [Laughing]

365
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:11,581
To France.

366
00:28:53,017 --> 00:28:58,236
Minus 15, 14... 13, 12...

367
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,721
11, 10... nine, eight, seven...

368
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:06,594
six, five, four...

369
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:13,042
three, two, one... - zero! 
- [Whistle Blowing]

370
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:09,807
- Sergeant, where's "B" Company? 

371
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:11,815
- I don't know, sir.

372
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:18,681
[Explosions In Distance] - Where in heaven's name are they? 
- On the left, sir.

373
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:21,926
Where are the rest? Zero-plus one, and they're still in the trenches. They're not advancing.

374
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:25,692
- Yes, sir. 
- Miserable cowards. They're not advancing!

375
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:28,755
The barrage is getting away from them! They're still in the trenches!

376
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,266
Yes, sir.

377
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:33,262
- Captain Nichols. 

378
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:34,804
- Yes, sir?

379
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:38,705
Order the 75s to commence firing on our own positions.

380
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:44,671
Captain, do you fail to comprehend the meaning of my order?

381
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:47,149
No, sir, but I respectfully ask to ...

382
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:50,483
Captain, do you fail to comprehend the meaning of my order?

383
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:51,487
No, sir. 

384
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:55,681
- Then carry it out, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

385
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,360
Hello, Polygon. This is Division.

386
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:07,370
Batteries 1 and 2 commence firing...

387
00:33:07,438 --> 00:33:12,432
on coordinates 32-58-78.

388
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,104
Batteries 1 and 2 to commence firing...

389
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:20,207
on coordinates 32-58-78. Over.

390
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:31,725
General, the battery commander reports those are our own positions.

391
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:33,388
He says it must be a mistake. 

392
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:38,803
- Confirm the order, Captain.
- Yes, sir. There is no mistake. The order is confirmed.

393
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:42,705
Battery commander respectfully reports he cannot execute such an order...

394
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,436
unless it is in writing and signed by the general. Over.

395
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:50,743
General, battery commander respectfully reports he cannot execute such an order...

396
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:53,010
unless it is in writing and signed by the general.

397
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:55,143
- Give me that phone! 
- Yes, sir.

398
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:01,055
General Mireau speaking! 

399
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,922
Battery commander speaking, sir.

400
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:07,532
The troops are mutinying, refusing to advance. Fire as ordered until further notice!

401
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:11,366
With all respect, sir, you have no right to order me to shoot down my own men...

402
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:14,962
unless you are willing to take full and undivided responsibility for it.

403
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,507
Captain Rousseau, are you going to obey my order?

404
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:21,204
I must have a written order before I can execute such a command, sir.

405
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:23,645
Supposing you're killed. Then where will I be?

406
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:27,241
You'll be in front of a firing squad tomorrow morning! That's where you'll be!

407
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:31,778
Hand over your command and report yourself under arrest to my headquarters!

408
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:45,596
Roget!

409
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:50,007
- Lieutenant Roget! Why are your men still in here? 
- It was impossible, sir. Major Vignon is dead.

410
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,168
Get these men out ofthe trenches! Come on!

411
00:34:52,243 --> 00:34:57,146
Let's get ready for another try! Get these men out of here!

412
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:59,478
I've tried three times. Look at all the casualties.

413
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:04,602
All right! Let's give it another try! Come on! Let's give it another try!

414
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:18,891
It's impossible, sir. All the men are falling back.

415
00:35:20,104 --> 00:35:24,507
Sir, I respectfully submit to the colonel ...

416
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:29,205
Pardon, your remarks to me were very unfair, sir.

417
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,977
It's just impossible! It's just impossible.

418
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,747
General, according to first reports, the attack has failed all along the line.

419
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:39,415
The men are falling back to our own trenches.

420
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,291
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for the immediate relief of the 701 st Regiment.

421
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:48,230
Have them sent to the Chateau d'Aigle. Have Colonel Dax report to my headquarters.

422
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:51,427
- Yes, sir. 
- Major Couderc, assemble a general court-martial.

423
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:54,062
Have it ready to meet at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

424
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:58,097
If those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones!

425
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:12,957
I ordered an attack. Your troops refused to attack.

426
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:15,448
Our troops did attack, sir, but they could make no headway.

427
00:36:15,526 --> 00:36:20,131
Because they didn't try, Colonel. I saw it myself. Half of your men never left the trenches.

428
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:23,032
A third of my men were pinned down because the fire was so intense.

429
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,517
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

430
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,602
The fact remains that a good part ofyour men never left their own trenches.

431
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:33,371
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men from each company in your regiment...

432
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:36,208
tried under penalty of death for cowardice.

433
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,874
- Penalty of death? - For cowardice!

434
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:41,179
They have skimmed milk in their veins instead of blood.

435
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:44,153
Then it's the reddest milk I've ever seen. My trenches are soaked with that red skimmed milk.

436
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:47,384
- That's just about enough out of you, Colonel! 
- I'm not gonna mince words and stand on protocol ...

437
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,052
Colonel Dax, if you continue in this manner, I shall have to place you under arrest.

438
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,790
I believe the colonel has a point, even though he makes it rather bluntly.

439
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:56,492
This is not a trial, but it does bear certain aspects of one.

440
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:59,968
And Colonel Dax, technically, is cast in the role of the defense.

441
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:02,369
In view of the gravity of the charges a court of law would grant

442
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:04,701
him all possible latitude in presenting his case.

443
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:07,972
Latitude is one thing. Insubordination another.

444
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:10,104
I am merely offering an opinion, General. 

445
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:12,274
Please do not feel constrained to accept it.

446
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:16,217
I am perfectly willing to accept it, General Broulard.

447
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:20,018
I'm sorry, sir. I certainly didn't intend to be insubordinate.

448
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:23,060
My only aim is to remind you of the heroism these men have shown...

449
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:25,186
on every occasion in the past.

450
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:28,163
We're not talking about the past. We're talking about the present.

451
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:30,723
But don't you see, sir? They're not cowards.

452
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,964
So if some of them didn't leave the trenches, it must have been because it was impossible.

453
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:38,600
They were ordered to attack. It was their duty to obey that order.

454
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:41,577
We can't leave it up to the men to decide when an order is possible or not.

455
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:44,679
If it was impossible, the only proof of that...

456
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,250
would be their dead bodies lying at the bottom ofthe trenches.

457
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,344
They're scum, Colonel.

458
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:55,126
The whole rotten regiment ... a pack of sneaking, whining, tail-dragging curs.

459
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:56,559
- Do you really believe that, sir?

460
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:59,926
- Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

461
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:02,966
And what's more, it's an incontestable fact.

462
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,196
Then why not shoot the entire regiment? I'm perfectly serious. 

463
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,037
- Now, Colonel, you're missing the point entirely.

464
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,742
We don't want to slaughter the French army. All we want to do is to set an example.

465
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,142
Oh, well, if it's an example you want, then take me.

466
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,646
- Take you? - Yes, sir, if it's an example you want...

467
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:19,342
one man will do as well as a hundred.

468
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:23,910
The logical choice is the officer most responsible for the attack.

469
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:27,086
[Broulard] Come now, Colonel. I thinkyou're overwrought.

470
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:29,786
This is not a question of officers.

471
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,988
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

472
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,690
Suppose we just make it a dozen.

473
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,936
[Exhales] I was talking of a hundred men, and now we're down to 12.

474
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:41,336
Paul, let's not haggle over this thing anymore!

475
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,465
Let's get it settled once and for all so that we can all live with it.

476
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,613
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious to see proper justice meted out.

477
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:53,775
I've spent my entire life in the army.

478
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:56,251
I've always tried to be true to my principles.

479
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,256
That's the only mistake I can ever be accused of.

480
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:02,451
I'll settle for this ...

481
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:07,122
have the company commanders select one man from each company in the first wave...

482
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:10,201
- three in all. 
- Well, that's very reasonable of you, Paul.

483
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:14,035
The court-martial will meet at the chateau at 3:00 this afternoon.

484
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,732
- Will that be convenient for you, General? - I won't be there, Paul.

485
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,206
You won't be there?

486
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,709
No, I think it best that you handle this matter on your own.

487
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:22,746
Probably so. 

488
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:24,612
General Mireau.

489
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,657
If it's at all possible, I'd like to be appointed counsel for the accused.

490
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,414
I'll take the matter into consideration.

491
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:33,388
I think we can permit that, can't we, Paul?  Of course we can.

492
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,481
- Consider it settled, Colonel. 
- Thank you, sir.

493
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:40,264
Well, noon straight up, Paul. I hope that you can stay for lunch, Colonel.

494
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:43,324
George, I'm afraid the colonel won't have time.

495
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,267
Don't deny it, Paul. You've been hiding this man, keeping him for your own.

496
00:39:46,337 --> 00:39:48,805
I think that was very selfish of you.

497
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:53,071
Thank you for your courtesy, General, but I'm afraid there isn't much time between now and 3:00.

498
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:57,079
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward to the pleasure of seeing you again.

499
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:19,799
- Yes, Captain? What is it?
- You ordered me to report to you here, sir.

500
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,930
- Captain Rousseau, battery commander, sir. 
- Yes, yes, of course.

501
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:26,841
I wanted to speak to you about some of your shells falling short.

502
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:31,215
I haven't time to go into it now. Report back to your command until further orders.

503
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,648
- Yes, sir. - [Heels Click]

504
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:38,284
- Bad stuff. Demoralizes the men. 
- I quite agree with you.

505
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:41,017
And the best solution is to shelve him to another outfit.

506
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:43,150
A court of inquiry ought to roast him a bit first.

507
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:47,798
Well, in cases like this ... shells falling short ... I ... I always try to avoid an inquiry.

508
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:51,234
It gets around among the men and makes a bad impression.

509
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:53,600
No, shelving will be the best discipline for him, in my opinion.

510
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:56,640
- Well, perhaps you're right. 
- Oh, uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

511
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:58,641
A regimental matter I want to mention to the colonel.

512
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,075
- I'll join you in the dining room. 
- Splendid. In a moment.

513
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,678
That will be Captain Sancy, Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

514
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:08,616
- Yes, sir. 
- Have them meet me at regimental headquarters in half an hour.

515
00:41:08,686 --> 00:41:10,620
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel Dax.

516
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,517
- Yes, sir. 
- I'd like a word with you.

517
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:16,957
Certainly, sir.

518
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:21,699
- Let's be sensible about this. 
- Sensible, sir?

519
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:26,650
Listen to me, Dax. Drop this fancy talk with me, understand?

520
00:41:26,704 --> 00:41:30,538
General Broulard seems to think you're funny. I don't.

521
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:34,839
- Now, I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon, sir. Is that an order?

522
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:38,712
Colonel Dax, when this mess is cleaned up, I'll break you.

523
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:40,773
I'll find an excuse and I'll break you to the ranks. I'll ruin you.

524
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:43,787
And it'll be just what you deserve...

525
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:47,348
showing such little loyalty to your commanding officer.

526
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,483
That's all, Colonel.

527
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,279
[Officer] Detail, halt!

528
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:15,376
General Mireau feels that the attack on the Anthill yesterday morning failed...

529
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:19,149
because of an inadequate effort on the part of the First Battalion.

530
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:21,623
Each of you is to select one man from your company...

531
00:42:21,692 --> 00:42:25,423
place him under arrest and have him ready to appear before a general court-martial...

532
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:28,192
no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.

533
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:30,597
The charge is cowardice in the face of the enemy.

534
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,659
You have your orders, gentlemen. Let's carry them out.

535
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:55,991
But Lieutenant Roget killed Lejeune on that patrol...

536
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,460
and then blackmailed me into keeping quiet about the whole thing!

537
00:42:58,529 --> 00:43:01,089
- That's why he picked me. 
- Corporal, I understand your feelings.

538
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:03,861
But that story has nothing to do with the charges you're being tried for.

539
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:06,801
- Don't you believe me, sir? 
- Yes, I do, 

540
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,587
but who else will? You've got no witnesses.

541
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:14,509
Besides, such charges against an officer would only antagonize the court.

542
00:43:14,578 --> 00:43:18,105
When we get clear of this, I'm going into the story of that patrol again.

543
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:22,084
Sir, in my case, Captain Renouart had the sergeant draw lots.

544
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:24,279
I was picked purely by chance.

545
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:26,822
You're lucky. Look at me.

546
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,384
I was just picked because Captain Sancy said I was a social undesirable.

547
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:33,726
Me, a social undesirable, Colonel.

548
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:36,425
- I didn't act like a coward. Picking by lots ... is that fair? 
- Neither did I! Major Vignon ...

549
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,626
Gentlemen! 

550
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:40,431
You've all got to understand that the reason you were picked is immaterial.

551
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:44,497
Whatever the reason, you're on trial for your lives.

552
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:53,149
Stick to the stories you've told me... and don't let the prosecutor shake you out of them.

553
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:56,709
Now remember, you'll be soldiers in the presence of superior officers.

554
00:43:56,787 --> 00:43:58,721
So act like what you are ... 

555
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:00,586
soldiers.

556
00:44:00,657 --> 00:44:03,148
And brave ones at that.

557
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:06,697
Now, I've been in the room you'll be sitting in. The afternoon sun will be in your faces...

558
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:11,031
so don't let it seem as if you're dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

559
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,701
When you answer questions, look the judges in the eye.

560
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:17,706
Don't whine, plead or make speeches. That's my job.

561
00:44:17,774 --> 00:44:19,765
Simple statements ... short...

562
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:21,834
but make them so they can be heard all over the room.

563
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:25,905
And try not to repeat yourselves. I'll do that for you when I sum up.

564
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,290
Now, we haven't much time.

565
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,419
The court-martial begins in about an hour, and I've got notes to look at.

566
00:44:32,356 --> 00:44:34,551
Good luck.

567
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,559
- Thank you, sir. 
- Colonel, sir.

568
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,767
On the left, ho!

569
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,689
Detail, halt!

570
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,570
On the left, ho!

571
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,079
On the left, ho!

572
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,626
Left face!

573
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:20,236
The court-martial is open. The prisoners may be seated.

574
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:32,583
[Coughs] This is a general court-martial. We shall therefore dispense with unnecessary formalities.

575
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:36,178
These men are charged with cowardice in the face of the enemy...

576
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:38,687
and will be tried for that offense.

577
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:40,017
- Mr. Prosecutor. 

578
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,355
- Call the accused ... Private Ferol.

579
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:45,535
Mr. President.

580
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,413
Will the prosecutor question the witnesses without even reading the indictment?

581
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:52,994
Please don't take up the court's time with technicalities.

582
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,870
The indictment is lengthy, and there's no point in reading it.

583
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,500
The defense has a right to know the exact accusations ...

584
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:02,204
The indictment is that the accused showed cowardice in the face of the enemy...

585
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:04,440
during the attack on the Anthill.

586
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:07,483
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

587
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:10,315
Call the accused ... Private Ferol.

588
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:23,166
- Private Ferol. - Yes, sir?

589
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:26,293
Were you in the first wave during the attack on the Anthill?

590
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,743
Yes, sir.

591
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,675
- Did you refuse to advance? 
- No, sir.

592
00:46:31,675 --> 00:46:34,769
- Did you advance? 
- Yes, sir.

593
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,403
How far did you advance?

594
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,746
To about the middle of no-man's-land, sir.

595
00:46:40,817 --> 00:46:44,221
Then what did you do? There were machine-gun bullets landing all around.

596
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,815
Answer the question. What did you do?

597
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,259
Well, I saw that me and Meyer, sir ...

598
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:53,489
I didn't ask you what you saw.

599
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:57,590
The court has no concern with your... visual experiences.

600
00:46:57,668 --> 00:47:01,001
- My what, sir? 
- Prisoner will reply to the question.

601
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:02,800
Yes, sir. What question was it?

602
00:47:02,873 --> 00:47:06,809
You advanced to the middle of no-man's-land. What did you do then?

603
00:47:06,877 --> 00:47:09,573
- Then, sir? 
- Did you go back or forward?

604
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:11,496
I went back, sir.

605
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:16,374
In other words, Private Ferol, you retreated.

606
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:18,887
Yes, sir.

607
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:22,618
That's all. The accused may return to his seat.

608
00:47:22,693 --> 00:47:23,955
Just a minute.

609
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:28,657
Mr. President, I'd like to question the witness if I may.

610
00:47:28,732 --> 00:47:30,393
- Proceed, Colonel. 
- Thank you.

611
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:35,339
Now, Private Ferol, when you reached the middle of no-man's-land...

612
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,307
were you alone with Private Meyer? 

613
00:47:37,374 --> 00:47:38,568
Yes, sir.

614
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:40,872
Well, what happened to the rest of your company?

615
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:45,445
Well, I don't know, sir. I guess the rest of them had been killed or wounded.

616
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:49,442
And you found yourself in the middle of no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

617
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,786
- Yes, sir. 
- Why didn't you attack the Anthill single-handed?

618
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,827
Why didn't you storm the Anthill alone?

619
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:02,091
Just me and Meyer? You're kidding, sir.

620
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:07,504
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol. Thank you. That's all.

621
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:10,234
I don't see the point of this line of questioning.

622
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,682
Well, I'm attempting to indicate, sir...

623
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:17,304
the utter absurdity of the line of questioning used by the prosecutor.

624
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,780
Mr. Prosecutor.

625
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:23,286
So you freely admit, Private Ferol, that you retreated.

626
00:48:23,353 --> 00:48:26,117
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

627
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:30,319
I knew we should've took Anthill, but we came on back.

628
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:34,660
[Dax] That's all.

629
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,957
The accused may return to his seat.

630
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:52,442
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

631
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:57,283
Yes, sir, until I was ordered back to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

632
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:59,447
How far did you advance?

633
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,457
Into the wire, sir.

634
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:05,325
The, uh, enemy wire, I suppose.

635
00:49:05,395 --> 00:49:07,329
No, sir. It was our wire.

636
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:14,135
You mean to tell me that you didn't advance any further than our wire?

637
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,172
No, sir, I didn't.

638
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:20,977
How far would you say that was? How many meters?

639
00:49:20,977 --> 00:49:23,639
Well, I advanced as far as I could.

640
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,908
How many meters?

641
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,214
Not many.

642
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:32,121
"Not many."

643
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:36,749
Now, Private Arnaud, 

644
00:49:36,827 --> 00:49:40,228
before you were ordered back...

645
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:42,663
did you urge your fellow soldiers forward?

646
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:47,666
Most of them were dead or wounded before they got three steps beyond the trenches.

647
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:49,102
Reply to the question.

648
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:51,766
I didn't urge them on. No, sir.

649
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:56,912
Thank you.

650
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:08,004
Private Arnaud ... At ease, please.

651
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:13,425
Aside from your sad failure to give throat to spirited battle cries

652
00:50:13,497 --> 00:50:15,465
was your behavior different in any respect from that

653
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:17,397
of the other men in your company?

654
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:19,298
Objection. That's a matter of conjecture.

655
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:21,564
Sustained.

656
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,474
Did any men in your company get beyond our wire?

657
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:28,909
No, sir.

658
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:31,379
Is it true that you've been designated a coward...

659
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:34,076
simply and purely because you drew a slip of paper marked "X"?

660
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,082
Yes, sir.

661
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:37,244
I don't see that that's significant.

662
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,154
It's accepted practice in the French army to pick examples by lot.

663
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:43,749
And since this entire company advanced only a few meters...

664
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:46,796
picking by lot was eminently fair in this case.

665
00:50:46,863 --> 00:50:49,661
Well, I'd like to point out that this soldier has distinguished himself...

666
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:53,100
in some of the bloodiest battles of the war.

667
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:55,219
With the court's permission...

668
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:59,673
I'll read citations for bravery that he's already earned on two occasions.

669
00:50:59,743 --> 00:51:03,474
First, citations in the Orders in the Army for bravery ...

670
00:51:03,547 --> 00:51:07,063
That's immaterial, Colonel. The accused is not being tried for his former bravery...

671
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:09,074
but for his recent cowardice.

672
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:11,484
Medals are no defense.

673
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,324
May I call witnesses to his character?

674
00:51:16,393 --> 00:51:18,190
You may not.

675
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:21,924
But you may call witnesses to the effect that he reached the German wire.

676
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,602
Mr. President, no one in the entire regiment...

677
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,867
got anywhere near the German wire, including myself.

678
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,767
Call the next accused...

679
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:35,072
if you're through, Colonel.

680
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,636
Thank you.

681
00:51:37,747 --> 00:51:40,978
Prisoner may return to his seat.

682
00:51:48,258 --> 00:51:52,193
[Prosecutor] So you never even left the trenches.

683
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,528
- No, sir. - That's all.

684
00:51:56,333 --> 00:52:00,599
Corporal Paris, why didn't you leave the trenches?

685
00:52:02,005 --> 00:52:05,964
Major Vignon was shot, and he fell back on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

686
00:52:06,076 --> 00:52:09,842
And were you lying unconscious in the trenches during the entire attack?

687
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:11,681
Yes, sir.

688
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:16,424
- That's all. 
- Have you any witnesses to that?

689
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:19,839
No, sir. I guess everybody was too busy to notice me. 

690
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,425
And there were so many others lying dead anyway.

691
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:26,384
- But you have no witnesses.
- No, sir.

692
00:52:26,496 --> 00:52:29,363
I only have a rather large cut on my head, sir.

693
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:31,627
That could have been self-inflicted later.

694
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:36,200
- Thank you. You may stand down. - [Clicks Heels]

695
00:52:41,778 --> 00:52:44,246
Mr. Prosecutor, you can make your plea now.

696
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,650
Gentlemen of the court...

697
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:55,657
this case speaks for itself.

698
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:59,661
All of us witnessed the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

699
00:53:02,232 --> 00:53:06,635
And I submit that that attack...

700
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:10,139
was a stain on the flag of France...

701
00:53:10,206 --> 00:53:12,504
a blot on the honor...

702
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,942
of every man, woman and child in the French nation.

703
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:21,646
It is to us that the sad, distressing...

704
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:27,620
repellant duty falls, gentlemen.

705
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:30,752
I ask this court to 

706
00:53:30,827 --> 00:53:33,796
find the accused guilty...

707
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:41,460
and impose the penalties prescribed by the Code of Military Justice.

708
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,276
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

709
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:50,879
Colonel, would you like to make your plea?

710
00:54:01,024 --> 00:54:03,458
Gentlemen of the court, there are times when I'm ashamed...

711
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:07,724
to be a member of the human race... and this is one such occasion.

712
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:13,560
It's impossible for me to summarize the case for the defense...

713
00:54:13,636 --> 00:54:17,299
since the court never allowed me a reasonable opportunity to present my case.

714
00:54:17,373 --> 00:54:20,308
Are you protesting the authenticity of this court?

715
00:54:23,113 --> 00:54:24,978
Yes, sir.

716
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:28,017
I protest against being prevented from introducing evidence...

717
00:54:28,084 --> 00:54:31,542
that I consider vital to the defense.

718
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:33,485
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

719
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,451
There has never been a written indictment of charges made

720
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:38,892
against the defendants.

721
00:54:38,962 --> 00:54:42,659
And lastly, I protest against the fact...

722
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:45,701
that no stenographic records of this trial have been kept.

723
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:59,375
The attack yesterday morning was no stain on the honor of France...

724
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,251
and certainly no disgrace to the fighting men of this nation.

725
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,687
But this court-martial is 

726
00:55:07,757 --> 00:55:09,520
such a stain and such a disgrace.

727
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:13,551
The case made against these men is a mockery of all human justice.

728
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:16,162
Gentlemen of the court...

729
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:19,316
to find these men guilty...

730
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:25,571
would be a crime to haunt each of you... till the day you die.

731
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:33,843
I can't believe that the noblest impulse of man ...

732
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:37,978
his compassion for another... can be completely dead here.

733
00:55:39,322 --> 00:55:42,257
Therefore, I humbly beg you...

734
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:46,923
show mercy to these men.

735
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,234
The accused will be escorted back to the guardroom.

736
00:55:55,305 --> 00:55:59,943
The hearing is closed. The court will now retire to deliberate.

737
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:01,911
There will be a guard of six men under arms ...

738
00:56:01,978 --> 00:56:05,414
rifles loaded, bayonets fixed ... two men to each prisoner.

739
00:56:05,481 --> 00:56:07,813
Any sign of trouble, the prisoners will be instantly covered.

740
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:11,820
And if the trouble doesn't subside at once, the prisoner will be shot on the spot.

741
00:56:11,921 --> 00:56:15,357
Everything must go off without a hitch with the least possible delay...

742
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,329
but it shouldn't be hurried. There must be no fumbling around.

743
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:22,526
I've been put in charge and made personally responsible...

744
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:25,591
for any lack of order or for any mistakes.

745
00:56:25,702 --> 00:56:30,765
But you can take it from me that I shall pass on any blame ... and with interest ...

746
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:34,571
to any one of you who fails in his duties.

747
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:37,477
Execution will take place 

748
00:56:37,547 --> 00:56:40,482
at 7:00 according to the verdict of the court-martial.

749
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:44,984
Detail, attention! Dismissed!

750
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:01,793
This is compliments of General Mireau.

751
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:05,421
- Duck.  - Well, tell him thanks. 
- Oh, don't blame me, soldier.

752
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:08,405
Hey, ugly, what are we supposed to eat this with ... our fingers?

753
00:57:08,478 --> 00:57:12,244
The guard says you can't have any knives or forks.

754
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:14,476
[Paris] Is this supposed to be our last meal or something?

755
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,509
It isn't "supposed to be" our last meal. It is our last meal.

756
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:20,816
Hey, this duck is terrific.

757
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:23,324
You suppose they put anything in the food?

758
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:25,861
First they poison us, then they shoot us?

759
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:32,702
[Spits] I think they put something in it. Like what?

760
00:57:32,702 --> 00:57:36,832
Like, uh ... Like something or make us groggy or something.

761
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,101
What would be wrong with that if they did?

762
00:57:39,175 --> 00:57:42,702
Maybe nothing for you, but I'm gonna get out of this somehow...

763
00:57:42,812 --> 00:57:44,503
and I don't wanna be drugged.

764
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:48,952
- [Arnaud] How are you gonna get out ... chew your way through that stone wall? 
- Arnaud.

765
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:51,921
Colonel Dax, he'll-he'll ... he'll see us through.

766
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:56,921
Listen, we gotta get out of here. They're gonna kill us in a few hours if we don't.

767
00:57:56,993 --> 00:58:00,554
- Have you got an idea? 
- No, but there's gotta be a way.

768
00:58:01,864 --> 00:58:04,526
How many guards you think they've got out there?

769
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,364
They may have a couple of squads. That's what it sounded like this morning.

770
00:58:07,437 --> 00:58:10,736
- Maybe they're some of our friends. 
- That's the Third Battalion.

771
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:14,140
Anyway, right now, we have no friends.

772
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:17,179
Why kid yourself? We're not gonna get out of this.

773
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,239
Maybe you're not, but I am. I'll guarantee you of that.

774
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:24,553
You see that cockroach?

775
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,817
Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

776
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,950
It'll have more contact with my wife and child than I will.

777
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:34,996
- I'll be nothing, and it'll be alive. - [Slams Table]

778
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:38,033
Now you got the edge on 'im.

779
00:58:42,472 --> 00:58:45,305
Good evening, my sons. I'm Father Dupree.

780
00:58:48,478 --> 00:58:53,316
- Is there any news? 
- Yes. I'm afraid I bring you very bad news.

781
00:58:53,316 --> 00:58:56,149
You must prepare yourselves for the worst. Colonel Dax asked me to tell you so.

782
00:58:56,219 --> 00:58:58,921
- Oh, mercy! No! 
- He's been in telephone contact with army headquarters...

783
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:04,394
but unable to speak to General Broulard or, for that matter, to anyone in authority.

784
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:07,761
- [Ferol Sobbing] - Same way at Division. No one wants to be found.

785
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,594
- How much time do we have? 
- You have plenty of time yet.

786
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,930
Certainly more than enough to prepare yourselves.

787
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,010
In nomine Patris... In the name of the Father ...

788
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,388
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

789
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,224
Amen.

790
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:32,077
[Ferol Continues, Indistinct] Father, will you take this letter for me, please?

791
00:59:32,188 --> 00:59:34,156
- Of course, my son. - It's to my wife.

792
00:59:34,223 --> 00:59:37,317
She won't understand this, and I tried to explain it to her.

793
00:59:37,393 --> 00:59:39,327
I'll see that she gets it.

794
00:59:39,395 --> 00:59:42,296
Do you want me to hear your confession?

795
00:59:42,365 --> 00:59:46,802
Well, Father, to tell you the truth, I'm not very religious.

796
00:59:46,903 --> 00:59:49,371
I know you're trying to help, and I appreciate it...

797
00:59:49,439 --> 00:59:52,431
but if I started praying now, I'd feel like a hypocrite.

798
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:54,476
Oh, that's an error, my son.

799
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:57,672
God is always ready to listen to your prayers.

800
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:06,115
- All right, Father. Will you please hear my confession now?                 
- Yes.

801
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:11,232
Have faith in your Creator, my son. Death comes to us all.

802
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:13,091
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

803
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:16,563
That's really deep. "Death comes to us all."

804
01:00:16,632 --> 01:00:18,930
That really is deep.

805
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:21,629
Say, Ferol, what's the matter... afraid your luck isn't going to hold out?

806
01:00:21,704 --> 01:00:24,798
Well, look. This is ... This is my religion.

807
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:27,205
O Great Bottle, forgive me my sins, for now I lay me down to sleep, Bo peep.

808
01:00:27,276 --> 01:00:29,744
May I drink of you first? Thank you. Amen.

809
01:00:29,846 --> 01:00:34,283
I understand your anguish, my son... but you must not let it harden your heart.

810
01:00:34,283 --> 01:00:36,478
May I tell you something, Father?

811
01:00:36,552 --> 01:00:38,577
Back in my hometown, there was a certain little cafe...

812
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:41,088
with an amusing sign over the bar.

813
01:00:41,157 --> 01:00:42,181
It read, "Do not be afraid to ask for credit...

814
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:46,762
for our way of refusing is very polite."

815
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:50,666
- Come on, Arnaud, sit down. You're drunk. - Come on. sit down.
- Oh, Paris, leave me alone. 

816
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:53,692
And you, get out of here with your sanctimonious pat answers.

817
01:00:53,803 --> 01:00:55,504
What are you hanging around for ... to torture us?

818
01:00:55,504 --> 01:00:57,206
- No. To help you with all my power. 
- Your power? You have no power!

819
01:00:57,206 --> 01:01:00,443
- Come on, Arnaud, take it easy. 
- No, but God has power.

820
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:03,105
- Does he? What a laugh! 
- You can be saved.

821
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:05,909
Saved? I'll be saved!

822
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,110
Cut it out, Arnaud!

823
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,251
Arnaud!

824
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,337
Arnaud.

825
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:24,054
Father, get a doctor. Quick.

826
01:01:32,675 --> 01:01:34,376
That should keep him quiet long enough. 

827
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:36,078
That's a nasty skull fracture though. He may not live out the night.

828
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:39,549
What are we supposed to do with him?

829
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:43,315
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher so that he won't slip when you tilt it vertically.

830
01:01:43,386 --> 01:01:46,412
Surely they won't execute a man in that condition.

831
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:51,016
I'm sorry, Father. The sentence will be carried out. I've already checked with the general on it.

832
01:01:51,093 --> 01:01:53,128
If he's still alive in the morning... pinch his cheeks a couple

833
01:01:53,128 --> 01:01:55,164
of times before you take him out on the field.

834
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:58,031
It may make him open his eyes. The general wants him to be conscious.

835
01:02:00,002 --> 01:02:01,526
- [Knocking] - [Dax] Yes?

836
01:02:04,106 --> 01:02:07,098
- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir. - Come in, come in.

837
01:02:08,177 --> 01:02:10,668
Sergeant Boulanger said that you wanted to see me, sir.

838
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:15,952
Yes, Lieutenant. Looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant thing on our hands in a few hours, doesn't it?

839
01:02:15,952 --> 01:02:18,944
- You mean the execution, sir. - Yes, I mean the execution.

840
01:02:19,055 --> 01:02:21,080
Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.

841
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,626
Oh, very unfortunate. That's just how I feel about it.

842
01:02:24,694 --> 01:02:27,390
None of us are happy about it, sir.

843
01:02:27,463 --> 01:02:29,294
How'd you happen to pick Corporal Paris?

844
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:32,300
- Well, I ... I had to pick somebody, sir. 
- That's right. You did.

845
01:02:32,368 --> 01:02:35,137
Of course, you had no personal motive in picking Paris, did you?

846
01:02:35,137 --> 01:02:38,374
Oh, no, sir.

847
01:02:38,374 --> 01:02:41,309
You picked him because he was a coward, didn't you?

848
01:02:42,712 --> 01:02:45,306
Well, did you or didn't you?

849
01:02:45,381 --> 01:02:47,406
Oh, yes, sir, I did.

850
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:51,988
[Exhales] Well ... Like you say, somebody had to be picked.

851
01:02:51,988 --> 01:02:55,651
- Oh, it was quite a problem, sir. 
- Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

852
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:58,558
I have to pick someone to be in charge of the firing squad tomorrow.

853
01:02:58,628 --> 01:03:00,858
Do you have any objections to taking the job?

854
01:03:01,998 --> 01:03:04,592
- Me, sir? 
- Yes, you.

855
01:03:06,936 --> 01:03:08,699
- Well ... 
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

856
01:03:08,771 --> 01:03:12,308
- Well, no ... Yeah, l-I feel all right, sir. It's just that I ... 
- Is it too hot in here?

857
01:03:12,308 --> 01:03:16,208
- Would you like me to open a window? 
- No, sir. No, sir.

858
01:03:16,779 --> 01:03:21,409
Well, it's ... It's just that I've never been in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

859
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:27,089
Oh, there's nothing to it. First, you help the sergeant tie the men to the posts.

860
01:03:27,089 --> 01:03:32,194
Of course, you offer the men blindfolds. And, well, if they want them, you tie them on, see?

861
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:35,391
Now, you ...you take your position with the firing squad...

862
01:03:35,464 --> 01:03:38,524
you raise your sword ... "Ready, aim, fire."

863
01:03:38,634 --> 01:03:41,797
Then you draw your revolver out, you walk forward...

864
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:44,203
and put a bullet through each man's head.

865
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:48,875
Sir, I request that I be excused from this duty.

866
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:51,003
Request denied.

867
01:03:51,113 --> 01:03:54,014
- Colonel, I ... - You've got the job.

868
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,017
It's all yours. That's all, Lieutenant.

869
01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:57,382
- Colonel, if you could just ... - That's all, Lieutenant!

870
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,051
- [Knocking] - Yes?

871
01:04:00,122 --> 01:04:02,090
- Excuse me, sir. Colonel Dax? 
- Yes.

872
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:04,827
My name is Rousseau, sir, Captain of Artillery.

873
01:04:04,827 --> 01:04:08,427
What is it, Captain?

874
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:17,403
I have something to tell you, sir, that may have a great bearing on the court-martial.

875
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,099
Come in, Captain.

876
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,695
- Well, Colonel, good evening. 
- Good evening, sir.

877
01:05:16,766 --> 01:05:19,064
- Good evening. Come and sit down. 
- Thank you, sir. I ...

878
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:22,438
I am really sorry to intrude on you in this way.

879
01:05:22,438 --> 01:05:25,601
Not at all. Always delighted to see you, Colonel Dax.

880
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:27,869
- Will you have a cigar? 
- No, thank you, sir, but ...

881
01:05:27,943 --> 01:05:31,174
- Well, I ... - [Chuckling] I think you'll find it delicious.

882
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:33,715
I must apologize for not inviting you to join the party downstairs tonight...

883
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:37,116
but I'm afraid that it's, uh, a dress affair.

884
01:05:37,186 --> 01:05:38,983
Well, thank you, sir, but I must confess that, 

885
01:05:39,054 --> 01:05:42,490
uh, this is not entirely a social visit.

886
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:47,119
Oh, come, Dax, let's not go over all that ground again.

887
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,690
Though, uh, I must admit that, judging from the casualties...

888
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,903
the efforts of your regiment must have been considerable.

889
01:05:53,903 --> 01:05:57,270
Now, how can you understand that and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

890
01:05:57,339 --> 01:06:00,206
Oh, come, Colonel. You're choosing to take a rather simple view of this thing.

891
01:06:00,276 --> 01:06:04,610
The attack was impossible from the start. The General Staff must have known that.

892
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:10,218
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing a good job running the war.

893
01:06:10,286 --> 01:06:13,372
You must be aware of the fact that the General Staff... is subject

894
01:06:13,372 --> 01:06:16,459
to all kinds of unfair pressures from newspapers and politicians.

895
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:19,360
Maybe the attack against the Anthill was impossible.

896
01:06:19,428 --> 01:06:21,589
Perhaps it was an error of judgment on our part.

897
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:25,760
On the other hand, if your men had been a little more daring, they might have taken it.

898
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:28,326
Who knows? In any case...

899
01:06:28,437 --> 01:06:32,203
why should we have to bear any more criticism for failure than we have to.

900
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:35,801
Aside from the inescapable fact that a good many of your men never left the trenches...

901
01:06:35,911 --> 01:06:38,345
there's the question of the troops' morale. Don't forget that.

902
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,371
- The troops' morale? 
- Certainly.

903
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:43,384
These executions will be a perfect tonic for the entire division.

904
01:06:43,486 --> 01:06:46,046
There are few things more fundamentally encouraging and stimulating...

905
01:06:46,155 --> 01:06:47,986
than seeing someone else die.

906
01:06:48,057 --> 01:06:51,049
- I never thought of that, sir. 
- You see, Colonel, troops are like children.

907
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,831
- Just as a child wants his father to be firm, troops crave discipline. 
- I see.

908
01:06:55,831 --> 01:06:58,732
And one way to maintain discipline is to shoot a man now and then.

909
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:02,264
May I ask...

910
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:05,307
do you sincerely believe all the things you've just said?

911
01:07:10,246 --> 01:07:12,180
It's been a pleasure discussing this with you, Colonel...

912
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:15,649
but I'm afraid that I'd better be getting back to my guests.

913
01:07:15,718 --> 01:07:18,653
Forgive me for having kept you from your party.

914
01:07:20,689 --> 01:07:24,386
Oh, by the way, sir, have you heard that General Mireau...

915
01:07:24,426 --> 01:07:27,827
ordered his own battery commander, Captain Rousseau...

916
01:07:27,897 --> 01:07:32,423
to open fire on his own positions during the attack? ?? [Waltz Continues]

917
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,901
Well, of course the captain refused without a written order...

918
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:41,374
but General Mireau demanded that he commence firing on our own trenches.

919
01:07:41,443 --> 01:07:44,880
Again Rousseau refused without an order in writing...

920
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,146
but again he was ordered, and again he refused ...

921
01:07:49,218 --> 01:07:50,947
all in front of witnesses.

922
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,750
Do you actually believe this fantastic story?

923
01:07:53,822 --> 01:07:57,952
Here are copies of the sworn statements from all the principals involved ...

924
01:07:58,027 --> 01:08:01,724
Battery Commander Rousseau, Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter...

925
01:08:01,797 --> 01:08:05,631
the telephone clerk and, uh, my own deposition.

926
01:08:05,701 --> 01:08:09,831
What has all this got to do with the charge against the condemned prisoners?

927
01:08:09,905 --> 01:08:13,568
A general in a tantrum over the failure of an impossible attack...

928
01:08:13,642 --> 01:08:17,408
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

929
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:21,313
Now, this same officer on the same day...

930
01:08:21,383 --> 01:08:25,342
orders a court-martial in which three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

931
01:08:25,454 --> 01:08:30,551
General, what would your, uh, newspapers and your politicians do with that?

932
01:08:31,627 --> 01:08:34,194
Colonel Dax, are you trying to blackmail me?

933
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:38,267
Sir, that's an ugly word, but you are in a difficult position.

934
01:08:38,267 --> 01:08:42,409
Too much has happened. Someone's got to be hurt. The only question is who.

935
01:08:44,473 --> 01:08:47,465
General Mireau's assault on the Anthill failed...

936
01:08:47,576 --> 01:08:51,342
and his order to fire on this own troops was refused.

937
01:08:51,413 --> 01:08:53,813
But his attempt to murder three innocent men...

938
01:08:53,882 --> 01:08:58,319
to protect his own reputation will be prevented by the General Staff.

939
01:09:05,494 --> 01:09:09,978
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax? I've been rude to my guests too long.

940
01:09:38,692 --> 01:09:40,592
[Boulanger] Detail, halt!

941
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:44,557
Order arms!

942
01:09:44,632 --> 01:09:46,566
Fall out!

943
01:10:12,092 --> 01:10:16,503
Courage, my son. The worst is over. [Ferol Praying, Indistinct]

944
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:29,101
Good morning, Paris.

945
01:10:29,209 --> 01:10:31,311
Good morning, Sergeant.

946
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:36,773
- How are you today?
- Not too bad. How are you?

947
01:10:38,919 --> 01:10:41,217
You missed some good chow in here last night.

948
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,654
What'd you have?

949
01:10:46,026 --> 01:10:48,859
Have you got a drink for us?

950
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:51,397
Take a swig of this.

951
01:10:54,735 --> 01:10:58,193
It just occurred to me ... A funny thing.

952
01:10:58,305 --> 01:11:01,172
I haven't had one sexual thought since the court-martial.

953
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:03,259
[Laughing] It's pretty extraordinary, isn't it?

954
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,309
- [Sobbing] - Pull yourself together. Act like a man.

955
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:11,208
- [Crying] 			   - Yes.
- Listen, Paris. Are you listening to me? 

956
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:13,377
There will be a lot of dignitaries, newspapermen out there.

957
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:15,546
You've got a wife and family. How do you want to be remembered?

958
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:17,815
I don't wanna die.

959
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,516
Many of us will be joining you before this war's over.

960
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:23,095
I don't care. I don't wanna die.

961
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:28,624
- [Gasping] Please save me, Sergeant. 
- I can't save you. No one can now.

962
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:32,968
This is the last decision you'll have a chance to make on earth.

963
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,667
You can pull yourself together, act like a man, or we'll have to drag you out of here.

964
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:39,645
In the end, it'll all be the same. It's up to you.

965
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,863
Well, let's get busy. You and Ferol take your coats off. It's no use hanging around here.

966
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:21,649
...with the help of thy grace to do penance 

967
01:12:21,722 --> 01:12:27,676
and to amend my life.

968
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,221
Amen.

969
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:33,999
Why do I have to die? For what?

970
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:40,267
Why do I have to die? Why? I didn't do anything.

971
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:43,366
We do not question the will of God, my son.

972
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:47,675
But I fought. I fought. I fought on the battlefield.

973
01:12:47,748 --> 01:12:51,206
Why don't they die? Why not put them to death?

974
01:12:51,318 --> 01:12:53,786
You showed courage in the face of the enemy, my son.

975
01:12:53,887 --> 01:12:55,752
Show it now before your own troops.

976
01:12:55,823 --> 01:12:58,257
But I'm scared. I'm scared.

977
01:12:59,593 --> 01:13:02,619
Oh, Father, I'm scared. Oh, my God.

978
01:13:02,729 --> 01:13:06,096
Courage. Brace yourself, man. Brace yourself.

979
01:13:13,841 --> 01:13:17,675
[Dupree] He said, "This day, thou shalt be with me in paradise."

980
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:22,647
- [Ferol] Really, Father? - Yes.

981
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:27,148
I don't understand why... [Sobbing]

982
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:31,918
I'll never see nobody again, Father. Please.

983
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,392
Courage, man. Brace yourself.

984
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:37,055
- I can't help it. - Brace yourself.

985
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:42,158
- I can't help it, Father. 
- O God, O Almighty God ...

986
01:13:42,269 --> 01:13:46,103
Oh, Christ! Christ! Grant courage to this man who is about to die.

987
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:47,902
Strengthen me, God! Please strengthen me!

988
01:13:54,548 --> 01:13:57,483
Why do I have to die, Father?

989
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,045
Why do I have to die, Father?

990
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:04,953
[Boulanger] About face!

991
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:17,029

Please don't. Please choose me to ... [Sobs]

I'm awfully glad you could be there, George.

1018
01:17:36,103 --> 01:17:38,901
This sort of thing is always rather grim.

1019
01:17:38,972 --> 01:17:41,099
But this one had a kind of splendor to it, don't you think?

1020

I have never seen an affair of this sort handled any better.

1021
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,662
The men died wonderfully.

1022
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,370
There's always that chance that one of them will do something

1023
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,078
that will leave everyone with a bad taste.

1024

This time, you couldn't ask for better.

1025

Yes?

1026

[Broulard] Yes, Colonel? You wanted to see me, sir.

[Chuckling] Oh, yes, yes. Come in, Colonel. Come in and sit down.

1028
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:08,496
Oh, Colonel Dax, your men died very well.

1029

- Would you like some coffee, Colonel? 
- No, thank you, sir.

1030
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:16,525
Oh, by the way, Paul, it's been brought to my attention...

1031
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,511
that you ordered your artillery to fire on your own men during the attack on the Anthill.

1032
01:18:22,415 --> 01:18:24,241
- I did what?  - [Cup Clatters]

1033
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:28,679
- Who told you that? 
- Colonel Dax came to me last night with the story.

1034
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:35,393
Colonel Dax, I've always known that you were a disloyal officer...

1035
01:18:35,462 --> 01:18:38,829
but I never dreamed that you would stoop to anything so low as this.

1036
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:43,199
General, I have sworn statements from Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter...

1037
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:46,034
Captain Rousseau, the battery commander who refused your order.

1038
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:48,370
I think it's infamous, absolutely infamous.

1039
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:50,705
Then there's no truth at all to the charge made by Colonel Dax?

1040
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,177
I don't see how you could even ask me that.

1041
01:18:53,246 --> 01:18:55,680
You cannot imagine how glad I am to hear that, Paul.

1042
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:58,275
I'm certain that you'll come through it all right.

1043
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,853
- I'll come through what? - There will have to be an inquiry.

1044
01:19:00,954 --> 01:19:04,658
- An inquiry? 					             
- But it won't amount to much. Those things never do. The public forgets. 

1045
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:07,491
- "Public"? 
- You've got to have the right to clear your name.

1046
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:12,999
You cannot allow such vile insinuations against your character to go undenied.

1047
01:19:13,099 --> 01:19:15,033
So that's it.

1048
01:19:16,203 --> 01:19:18,171
You're making me the goat ...

1049
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:21,230
the only completely innocent man in this whole affair.

1050
01:19:25,645 --> 01:19:29,103
I have only one last thing to say to you, George.

1051
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:32,913
The man you stabbed in the back is a soldier.

1052
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:43,253
Well...

1053
01:19:44,764 --> 01:19:46,459
had to be done.

1054
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:49,866
France cannot afford to have fools guiding her military destiny.

1055
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:52,962
I'm grateful to you, Dax, for having brought this matter to my attention.

1056
01:19:53,073 --> 01:19:56,509
Colonel Dax, how would you like General Mireau's job?

1057
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:00,677
- His what, sir? 
- His job.

1058
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:04,380
Let me get this straight, sir.

1059
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:07,284
You're offering me General Mireau's command?

1060
01:20:07,354 --> 01:20:10,187
Come, come, Colonel Dax. Don't overdo the surprise.

1061
01:20:10,257 --> 01:20:13,590
You've been after the job from the start. We all know that, my boy.

1062
01:20:14,694 --> 01:20:17,686
I may be many things, sir, but I'm not your boy.

1063
01:20:17,797 --> 01:20:20,732
Well, I certainly didn't mean to imply any biological relationship.

1064
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,825
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- You trying to provoke me, Colonel?

1065
01:20:22,936 --> 01:20:25,063
- Why should I want to do that, sir? 
- Exactly.

1066
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,900
It would be a pity to lose your promotion before you get it...

1067
01:20:26,973 --> 01:20:31,171
a promotion you have so very carefully planned for.

1068
01:20:32,312 --> 01:20:36,112
Sir, would you like me to suggest what you can do with that promotion?

1069
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:40,619
Colonel Dax! You will apologize at once, or I shall have you placed under arrest!

1070
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:45,756
I apologize for not being entirely honest with you.

1071
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:49,659
I apologize for not revealing my true feelings.

1072
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:51,890
I apologize, sir, for not telling you sooner...

1073
01:20:51,965 --> 01:20:54,934
that you're a degenerate, sadistic old man...

1074
01:20:55,001 --> 01:20:58,903
and you can go to hell before I apologize to you now or ever again!

1075
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:05,705
Colonel Dax, you're a disappointment to me.

1076
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:09,806
You've spoiled the keenness of your mind by wallowing in sentimentality.

1077
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:11,941
You really did want to save those men...

1078
01:21:12,052 --> 01:21:14,850
and you were not angling for Mireau's command.

1079
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:18,755
You're an idealist, and I pity you as I would the village idiot.

1080
01:21:18,825 --> 01:21:21,293
We're fighting a war, Dax, a war that we've got to win.

1081
01:21:21,394 --> 01:21:23,362
Those men didn't fight, so they were shot.

1082
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:27,866
You bring charges against General Mireau, so I insist that he answer them.

1083
01:21:27,934 --> 01:21:30,061
Wherein have I done wrong?

1084
01:21:33,173 --> 01:21:37,075
Because you don't know the answer to that question...

1085
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:40,078
I pity you.

1086
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:08,140
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

1087
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:10,608
Now, gentlemen, we have a little special entertainment for you.

1088
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:12,110
[Cheering, Clamoring]

1089
01:22:15,882 --> 01:22:18,680
Sort of a ... sort of a little diversion as it were.

1090
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:23,314
And as my wife always says, "What is life without a little diversion?"

1091
01:22:25,258 --> 01:22:29,718
Now, gentlemen, I give you our latest acquisition from the enemy.

1092
01:22:29,829 --> 01:22:31,091
[Booing, Whistling]

1093
01:22:31,931 --> 01:22:36,534
- From Germany. - [Booing] The land of the Hun.

1094
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:04,159
Gentlemen, a little pearl washed ashore

1095
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:09,442
by the tide of war.

1096
01:23:15,608 --> 01:23:19,544
Hey! Talk in a civilized language.

1097
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:22,779
- [Whistling, Laughing] - It's true the little lady has her limitations.

1098
01:23:22,849 --> 01:23:26,114
As a matter of fact, she has absolutely no talent at all ...

1099
01:23:26,186 --> 01:23:32,965
except, that is, well, maybe a little natural talent? [Laughing, Whistling]

1100
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:38,030
The little lady can't dance, she can't tell any jokes...

1101
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:40,766
and she can't balance rubber balls on her little nose.

1102
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:46,230
- [Booing] - Ah, but she can sing like a bird. She has a throat of gold.

1103
01:23:46,339 --> 01:23:51,526
- Come on, baby! - Come on, honey! Sing us a song! 
- Come on, honey! How about a song? 

1104
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,993
Come on, baby! Sing us a song!

1105
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,518
Louder! Louder!

1106
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:25,731
- Sir. 
- Yes, Sergeant?

1107
01:26:25,798 --> 01:26:28,733
We have orders to move back to the front immediately.

1108
01:26:30,303 --> 01:26:33,067
- Give the men a few minutes more, Sergeant. - Yes, sir.
