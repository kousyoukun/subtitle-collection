What'd you do?

165
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:15,880
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

166
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,892
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

167
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:22,021
Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

168
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,938
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

169
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,007
You got an hour.

170
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,039
[Malcolm] Hi.

171
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,419
Wanna sit?

172
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:54,258
Don't feel like
talking today?

173
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,931
Wanna play a game?

174
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,901
It's a mind-reading game.

175
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,974
Here's how it works.

176
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,508
I read your mind.

177
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:11,876
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

178
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:15,974
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

179
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,985
towards the doorway.

180
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,648
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

181
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,557
If you reach the door,
you can go.

182
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,063
Wanna play?

183
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:38,272
Okay.

184
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:57,390
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

185
00:22:57,493 --> 00:23:01,725
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

186
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,925
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

187
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:25,646
You're worried that she said
she told him things...

188
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:28,053
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

189
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:31,325
Secrets.

190
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,795
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

191
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,210
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

192
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:11,531
He forgot it in a drawer.

193
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,567
Doesn't work.

194
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:29,049
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

195
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:33,952
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

196
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,230
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

197
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:45,459
Anything we wanted.

198
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:51,406
I drew a man.

199
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,441
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

200
00:24:58,147 --> 00:25:00,775
You saw that on TV, Cole?

201

[Footsteps]

202
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,686
Everyone got upset.

203
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:10,587
They had a meeting.

204
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,593
Mom started crying.

205
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:15,186
I don't draw
like that anymore.

206
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,392
How do you draw now?

207
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:25,071
I draw... people smiling,

208
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:27,108
dogs running,

209
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,511
rainbows.

210
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,840
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

211
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:39,182
No. I guess they don't.

212
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,690
What am I thinking now?

213
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,291
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

214
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,474
I was thinking...

215
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:04,478
you're nice,

216
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,007

restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

I'm so sorry, Anna.

221
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,409
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

222
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:48,089
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

223
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,394
They're both so similar.

224
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:59,797
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

225
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:05,706
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

226
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,210
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

227
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:12,906
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

228
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:15,313
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

229
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,320
[Sighs]
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

230
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:25,155
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

231
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:30,531
Or I could just be wrong.

232
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:33,659
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

[Sighs]
Anna.

a little distant, all right?

00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,945
I know that it makes you mad.
I just...

236

feel like I'm being given
a second chance, and
I don't want it to slip away.

I walk this way to school

Is he your best buddy?

No.

Yes.

about how things are with Tommy?

- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

252
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,371
Bcause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

- I don't want her to know.

You are not a freak.
Okay?

Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

258
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:08,227
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

I don't know. I was just

You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

How come?

272
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:58,466
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

273
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:03,705
to express our feelings
about certain issues...

274
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:07,145
divorce, whatever.

275
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,945
For example, a person might
leave something on the desk
for someone else to find.

Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

277

[Cole] No.

278
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,762
[Malcolm] Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

279
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:31,238
and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.

280
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,002
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

281
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:37,442
You just keep
your hand moving.

282
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:41,505
And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough,

283
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,017
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

284
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,558
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

285
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:53,957
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

Okay. Some twists.

Give me an example.

right? Okay, so...

about why you're sad.

Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

492
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:30,823
He worked with children.

493
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:35,018
He loved it.

494
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:38,064
He loved it
more than anything else.

495
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:42,535
And then one night,
he found out that...

496
00:48:42,637 --> 00:48:45,765
he made a mistake
with one of them.

497
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:48,433
He couldn't help that one.

498
00:48:50,077 --> 00:48:52,637
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

499
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:54,977
He can't forget.

500
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:00,416
Ever since then,
things have been different.

501
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:05,191
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

502
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,292
And his wife...

503
00:49:09,397 --> 00:49:13,060
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

504
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,727
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

505
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,869
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

506
00:49:22,977 --> 00:49:26,640
A really cool little boy.

507

Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

508
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:35,079
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

509
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:41,751
'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

510
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:46,561
it will be like...
helping that other one too.

01:03:58,844 --> 01:04:01,369
can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

637
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:05,807
Look at my face.

638
01:04:05,918 --> 01:04:08,785
I'm not very mad.

639
01:04:11,757 --> 01:04:15,488
- [Sobbing]
- Baby, why are you shaking?

640
01:04:16,762 --> 01:04:18,957
Cole, what's wrong?

641
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,830
Oh, God,
please tell me!

642
01:04:22,968 --> 01:04:26,335
Oh, please.

643
01:04:27,606 --> 01:04:30,166
[Sobbing]
Oh.

644
01:04:39,351 --> 01:04:42,218
It's Edwardian,
beautifully worked...

645
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:47,349
with mine-cut diamonds
and an actual color Burmese sapphire.

646
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:50,087
It's timeless.

647
01:04:50,196 --> 01:04:52,562
- Oh.
- [Door Closes, Bells Jingling]

648

You, uh...
[Clears Throat]

649
01:04:55,234 --> 01:04:57,896
Got anything
a little plainer?

650
01:04:58,037 --> 01:05:02,701
Plainer? You want a plain ring
to go with your plain fiance?
Is that how it is?

651
01:05:02,808 --> 01:05:06,642
No! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.

652
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:13,545
Uh...
You're so beautiful.

653
01:05:13,652 --> 01:05:17,349
You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

654
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:20,254
- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.

655
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:22,827
Why don't you
try it on...

656
01:05:22,928 --> 01:05:25,123
and see how you both
feel about it.

657
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:33,927
There. How does
that feel?

658
01:05:34,073 --> 01:05:38,339
I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.

659
01:05:38,444 --> 01:05:41,436
I imagine that the woman
who owned it...

660
01:05:41,547 --> 01:05:44,607
Ioved a man that she
couldn't be with.

661
01:05:46,118 --> 01:05:49,246
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

662
01:05:49,355 --> 01:05:53,416
- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...

663
01:05:53,525 --> 01:05:56,460
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

664
01:05:56,562 --> 01:05:59,895
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

665
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:06,166
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

666
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:09,706
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

667
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:13,539
like...
like fingerprints.

668
01:06:15,648 --> 01:06:17,707
I'll just
wrap it up.

669
01:06:24,623 --> 01:06:26,887
You don't need a guy
with a Master's.

670
01:06:26,992 --> 01:06:29,722
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

671
01:06:29,828 --> 01:06:32,991
[Chuckles]
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.

672
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:36,657
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

673
01:06:36,802 --> 01:06:39,134
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

674
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:50,777
It's a...
first edition.

675
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:53,317
- Wow.
- [Chuckles]

676
01:06:53,419 --> 01:06:56,252
- You know, this is too much.
- No.

677
01:06:56,355 --> 01:06:58,220
Took it out of
your Christmas bonus.

678
01:06:58,324 --> 01:07:02,556
[Chuckles]
It's perfect, Anna.

679
01:07:02,661 --> 01:07:06,188
- Thanks.
- [Chuckles]

680

[Cole] What do you want
more than anything?

681
01:07:13,672 --> 01:07:15,867
[Malcolm] I don't know.

682
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:18,739
- [Cole] I've told you what I want.
- [Glass Breaking]

683
01:07:21,513 --> 01:07:23,413
[Malcolm] I know what I want.

684
01:07:25,651 --> 01:07:28,347
I want to be able to
talk to my wife again.

685
01:07:30,689 --> 01:07:33,988
The way we used to
talk to each other.

686
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:36,721
Like there was no one else
in the world except us.

687
01:07:38,897 --> 01:07:40,228
[Cole] How are you gonna do that?

688
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:48,338
Can't be your doctor
anymore.

689
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,968
I haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

690
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:55,137
Bad things happen
when you do that.

691
01:07:56,982 --> 01:07:59,280
Do you understand?

692
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:03,287
- I'm going to transfer you.
I know two psychologists.
- Don't fail me.

693
01:08:05,858 --> 01:08:08,418
Don't give up. You're the only one
who can help me, I know it.

694
01:08:10,162 --> 01:08:12,926
- I can't help you.
- [Sobbing]

695
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,033
You...

696
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:19,195
Someone else
can help you.

697
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:26,034
You believe me, right?

698
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:31,975
Dr. Crowe, you believe
my secret, right?

699
01:08:34,219 --> 01:08:37,017
I don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

700
01:08:47,266 --> 01:08:50,167
How can you help me...

701
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:52,931
if you don't believe me?

702
01:08:56,642 --> 01:09:00,669
Some magic's real.

[Vincent] Do you know why you're
afraid when you're alone?

Vincent,
why are you crying?

01:09:48,827 --> 01:09:52,160
[Vincent Sniffles] You won't believe.

711
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:01,630
[Malcolm] Sorry, Vincent. I hope
I didn't leave you alone too long.

- Nah, you know what?
I never liked him either.

716
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:26,587
When I was a kid,
I had this blood test done,

717

- and I threw up chili cheese
fries all over this male nurse.
- [Vincent Laughing]

excuse me? I have to take this.

It's good exercise.

questions now?

Want to be a lance corporal in Company
"M," Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

We're being dispatched

Yes.
I think I am.

Do you know what
"Yo no quiero morir" means?

743
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:12,260
It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die."

744
01:13:14,966 --> 01:13:17,526
What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

745
01:13:25,677 --> 01:13:27,804
I want you to
think about it, Cole.

746
01:13:29,414 --> 01:13:32,872
I want you to think about it
really carefully.

747

What do you think
they want?

748
01:13:39,424 --> 01:13:43,793
- Just help.
- That's right. That's what I think too.

749
01:13:43,895 --> 01:13:46,295
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

to make them go away.

don't want help?

What if they're just angry and they
just want to hurt somebody?

01:20:08,113 --> 01:20:10,479
I think so, yes.

793
01:20:16,387 --> 01:20:20,790
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

794
01:20:20,925 --> 01:20:23,223
God help them.

795
01:20:42,747 --> 01:20:45,238
Don't go home,
okay?

796
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:47,818
I definitely won't.

797
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:45,703
Aah!
[Panting]

798
01:22:46,237 --> 01:22:48,603
Mister?

799
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:54,008
Excuse me, mister.

800
01:22:58,283 --> 01:23:00,751
Are you
Kyra's daddy?

801
01:23:14,265 --> 01:23:17,826
It's for you.

802
01:23:17,936 --> 01:23:21,030
Sh-She wanted
to tell you something.

803
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:56,905
[Static]

804
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,570
[Kyra's Voice] Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!

805
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,151
Would you like to dance?

806
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:13,189
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

807
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:15,758
Oh, well,
how about this?

808
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:19,296
We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don't like the way I dance,

809
01:24:19,397 --> 01:24:21,331
you can kick me.

810
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:23,457
Oh, okay then.

811
01:25:19,924 --> 01:25:21,915
[Liquid Pouring]

812
01:25:33,571 --> 01:25:36,768
[Woman] It's time for lunch, Kyra.

813
01:25:40,912 --> 01:25:43,608
- [Kyra] I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.

814
01:25:43,714 --> 01:25:45,978
[Kisses]
It's time for your food.

815
01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:50,214
Can I go outside
if I eat this?

816
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,720
I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.

817
01:25:52,824 --> 01:25:55,588
We'll see.

818
01:25:57,228 --> 01:26:01,028
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

819
01:26:03,768 --> 01:26:07,966
Tami's mom called.

820
01:26:23,454 --> 01:26:25,820
You were
keeping her sick.

821
01:26:42,707 --> 01:26:45,403
You liked it,
she said.

822
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:51,506
She looked out
for you.

823
01:26:51,616 --> 01:26:53,880
Is Kyra coming back?

824
01:26:57,054 --> 01:26:59,887
[Cole] Not anymore.

825
01:27:06,964 --> 01:27:09,228
[Woman] I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.

826
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:11,927
[Cole] Okay.

827
01:27:12,036 --> 01:27:15,665
- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry!

828
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:21,474
Who, uh...
Who were you talking to?

829
01:27:28,386 --> 01:27:31,378
Just practicing
my lines.

830
01:27:34,592 --> 01:27:37,356
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

831
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:41,192
You know, when I went to school
here, there was a terrible fire
in this section of the theater.

832
01:27:41,299 --> 01:27:43,290
They rebuilt
the whole thing.

833
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:46,302
Yeah, I know.

834
01:27:47,872 --> 01:27:50,568
[Audience Sighing]

835
01:27:56,514 --> 01:28:01,315
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

836
01:28:01,452 --> 01:28:03,977
Let the boy try.

837
01:28:06,057 --> 01:28:08,150
[Scattered Applause]

838
01:28:11,262 --> 01:28:14,254
He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

839
01:28:14,365 --> 01:28:17,095
- Silence, village idiot.
- [Scattered Giggling]

840
01:28:17,201 --> 01:28:19,965
Let the boy
step forward.

01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:56,939

[Chattering]

849
01:29:22,366 --> 01:29:25,267
[Malcolm] I thought you were
really great in the play, Cole.

850
01:29:25,369 --> 01:29:27,496
- Really?
- Yeah.

851
01:29:27,605 --> 01:29:30,005
- You know what else?
- What?

852
01:29:30,107 --> 01:29:34,510
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big time. [Chuckles]

[Chuckles]

854
01:29:41,786 --> 01:29:45,119
I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.

855
01:29:45,222 --> 01:29:48,453
Wait till
she's asleep.

856
01:29:48,559 --> 01:29:52,051
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

857
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:02,600
I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I?

858
01:30:04,742 --> 01:30:07,575
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

859
01:30:09,113 --> 01:30:12,105
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

860
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:17,178
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

861
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:21,888
Just for pretend.

862
01:30:28,165 --> 01:30:30,531
Okay.

863
01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:37,207
I'm gonna go now.

864
01:30:43,314 --> 01:30:45,646
I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.

- [Siren Blaring]
- [Chattering, Indistinct]

866
01:31:12,877 --> 01:31:16,404
I'm okay, Officer.
L-I'm okay.

867
01:31:16,514 --> 01:31:18,744
I don't know
what happened.

868
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:27,022
[Lynn] Hmm.

869
01:31:27,124 --> 01:31:30,218
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

870
01:31:33,464 --> 01:31:36,558
You're very quiet.

871
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,931
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

872
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:42,436
I have two jobs, baby.

873
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,475
You know how important
they are for us.

874

[Sighs]

875
01:31:47,578 --> 01:31:49,978
I'd give anything
to have been there.

876
01:32:01,859 --> 01:32:04,123
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

877
01:32:09,433 --> 01:32:11,424
Communicate?

878
01:32:13,037 --> 01:32:15,369
Tell you my secrets.

879
01:32:16,974 --> 01:32:19,408
What is it?

880
01:32:23,214 --> 01:32:25,978
You know the accident
up there?

881
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:29,075
Yeah.

882
01:32:29,186 --> 01:32:31,245
Someone got hurt.

883
01:32:31,355 --> 01:32:33,516
They did?

884
01:32:33,624 --> 01:32:37,116
A lady.

885
01:32:37,228 --> 01:32:39,492
She died.

886
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:41,997
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?

887
01:32:43,534 --> 01:32:46,526
- Yes.
- Where is she?

888
01:32:50,174 --> 01:32:54,042
Standing next to
my window.

889
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:03,052
Cole, you're
scaring me.

890
01:33:03,153 --> 01:33:05,417
They scare me too
sometimes.

891
01:33:08,092 --> 01:33:10,322
They?

892
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:15,130
Ghosts.

893
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:22,004
You see ghosts, Cole?

894
01:33:24,241 --> 01:33:27,039
They want me to
do things for them.

895
01:33:29,847 --> 01:33:32,008
They...
They talk to you?

896
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:35,176
They tell you
to do things?

897
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,221
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

898
01:33:40,758 --> 01:33:43,488
What are you
thinking, Mama?

899
01:33:43,594 --> 01:33:48,190
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

900
01:33:48,299 --> 01:33:51,268
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

901
01:33:52,603 --> 01:33:55,003
- Got it?
- Got it.

902
01:34:02,313 --> 01:34:04,338
Just let me think
for a minute.

903
01:34:08,252 --> 01:34:10,311
Grandma says hi.

904
01:34:13,824 --> 01:34:16,952
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

905
01:34:17,061 --> 01:34:19,689
She just
likes it a lot.

906
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:26,068
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

907
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:31,235
Cole, that's
very wrong.

908
01:34:31,342 --> 01:34:33,867
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

909
01:34:33,978 --> 01:34:37,277
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Cole, please stop.

910
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:40,111
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

911
01:34:41,785 --> 01:34:45,380
She said
when you were little,

912
01:34:45,489 --> 01:34:47,389
you and her
had a fight...

913
01:34:47,491 --> 01:34:50,221
right before
your dance recital.

914
01:34:52,496 --> 01:34:57,195
- [Sniffles]
- You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.

915
01:35:01,038 --> 01:35:03,370
She did.

916
01:35:08,746 --> 01:35:12,546
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

917
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:15,448
Sh-She said you were
like an angel.

918

- [Sobbing]
- She said...

919
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:25,750
you came to the place
where they buried her,

920
01:35:27,998 --> 01:35:30,432
asked her a question.

921
01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:37,336
She said
the answer is...

922
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:39,341
every day.

923
01:35:41,979 --> 01:35:44,447

[Man] Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

932
01:36:36,366 --> 01:36:38,960
I'm not
used to doing this,

933
01:36:39,069 --> 01:36:42,698
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

934
01:36:42,806 --> 01:36:46,902
I'll leave that to her mother.
[Chuckles]

935
01:36:47,044 --> 01:36:49,205
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

936
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:52,144
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

937
01:36:52,249 --> 01:36:55,047
It's bittersweet almost,
for me,

938
01:36:55,152 --> 01:36:57,313
'cause I hate
giving her up.

939
01:36:57,421 --> 01:36:59,480
[Malcolm] Anna?

940

[Applause On Television]

941
01:37:09,366 --> 01:37:11,266
I miss you.

942
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,767
I miss you too.

943
01:37:19,877 --> 01:37:22,641
Why, Malcolm?

944
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:25,510
What?

945
01:37:27,317 --> 01:37:30,912
- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?

946
01:37:31,021 --> 01:37:34,286
I didn't leave you.

[Object Clatters]

948
01:37:54,978 --> 01:37:58,675
[Cole] I see people.

01:37:58,782 --> 01:38:01,216
They don't know
they're dead.

950

do you see them?
- [Cole] All the time.

01:38:12,863 --> 01:38:14,728
[Cole] They're everywhere.

952
01:38:26,143 --> 01:38:28,611
They only see
what they want to see.

953
01:38:34,051 --> 01:38:37,543
[Malcolm On TV] Okay, Mikey.

954
01:38:37,654 --> 01:38:40,919
Come on.
Give me a minute.

[Doorknob Turning]

956
01:38:51,869 --> 01:38:53,769
[Panting]

957
01:39:04,047 --> 01:39:06,572

958
01:39:06,717 --> 01:39:08,617

[Anna Screams]

961
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,851
[Whimpering]

962
01:39:18,962 --> 01:39:21,260
- Oh, God.
- [Groaning]

963
01:39:21,365 --> 01:39:24,994
- [Mumbling] It doesn't even hurt.
- Let me see.

964
01:39:27,604 --> 01:39:30,801
- Let me see. Put your hand...

Oh, God.

[Sobbing]

969
01:39:59,603 --> 01:40:03,403
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went...

970
01:40:03,507 --> 01:40:05,805
went in and out.

971
01:40:08,912 --> 01:40:12,040
It doesn't even
hurt anymore.

972
01:40:41,511 --> 01:40:43,945
I think
I can go now.

973
01:40:47,751 --> 01:40:50,151
I just needed
to do a couple things.

974
01:40:55,292 --> 01:40:57,920
I needed
to help someone.

975
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,660
I think I did.

976
01:41:08,772 --> 01:41:11,468
And I needed
to tell you something.

977
01:41:16,313 --> 01:41:19,407
You were never second.

978
01:41:19,549 --> 01:41:22,040
Ever.

979
01:41:24,354 --> 01:41:26,982
I love you.

980
01:41:32,596 --> 01:41:34,791
You sleep now.

981
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:39,260
Everything will be
different in the morning.

982
01:41:45,442 --> 01:41:48,377
Good night,
Malcolm.

983
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:55,650
Good night,
sweetheart.
