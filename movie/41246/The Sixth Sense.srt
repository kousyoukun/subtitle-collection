I quit my jobs,

165
00:20:56,016 --> 00:21:00,979
and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

166
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:04,399
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

167
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,443
What'd you do?

168
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:15,284
I was qicked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

169
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,286
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

170
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:21,456
Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

171
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:29,380
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

172
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,425
You got an hour.

173
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:40,474
[Malcolm] Hi.

174
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,813
Wanna sit?

175
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,653
Don't feel like
talking today ?

176
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,366
Wanna play a game?

177
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,328
It's a mind-reading game.

178
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:05,413
Here's how it works.

179
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:07,916
I read your mind.

180
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,294
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

181
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,423
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

182
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:17,424
towards the doorway.

183
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,053
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

184
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:24,973
If you reach the door,
you can go.

185
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,476
Wanna play ?

186
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:37,651
Okay.

187
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,752
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

188
00:22:56,877 --> 00:23:01,131
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't hello her.

189
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,342
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

190
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,028
You're worried that she said
she told him things--

191
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,447
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

192
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:30,700
Secrets.

193
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,250
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

194
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:57,725
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

195
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,070
He forgot it in a drawer.

196
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:13,072
Doesn't work.

197
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,545
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

198
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,466
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

199
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:42,683
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

200
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:44,935
Anything we wanted.

201
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,857
I drew a man.

202
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:53,901
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

203
00:24:57,571 --> 00:25:00,240
You saw that on TV, Cole?

Everyone got use.

206
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,124
They had a meeting.

207
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:12,126
Mom started crying.

208
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:14,712
I don't draw
like that anymore.

209
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,924
How do you draw now?

210
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:24,554
I draw... people smiling,

211
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:26,639
dogs running,

212
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,976
rainbows.

213
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:34,355
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

214
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,692
No. I guess they don't.

215
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:50,161
What am I thinking now?

216
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:53,789
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

217
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:01,964
I was thinking...

218
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:03,965
you're nice,

219
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,553

restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

I'm so sorry, Anna.

224
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:41,875
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

225
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,589
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

226
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,804
They're both so similar.

227
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:59,308
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

228
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:05,188
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

229
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:09,692
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

230
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:12,403
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

231
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:14,822
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

232
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:19,743
[Sighs]
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

233
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:24,581
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

234
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:29,961
Or I could just be wrong.

235
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:33,130
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

a little distant, all right?

I walk this way to school

No.

Yes.

Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

everybody else, and I don't want her to.

You are not a freak.
Okay?

Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

261
00:29:05,382 --> 00:29:07,717
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

I don't know. I was just

You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

How come?

275
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,901
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

276
00:30:58,027 --> 00:31:03,115
to express our feelings
about certain issues--

277
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,576
divorce, whatever.

278
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:10,371
For example, a person might
leave something on the desk
for someone else to find.

Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

280

[Cole] No.

281
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:25,135
[Malcolm] Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

282
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,598
and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.

283
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,351
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

284
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:36,812
You just keep
your hand moving.

285
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,899
And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough,

286
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,361
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

287
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:49,949
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

288
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,369
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

that he fell asleep.

Okay. Some twists.

Give me an example.

That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so--

about why you're sad.

Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

496
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,324
He worked with children.

497
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,453
He loved it.

498
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,498
He loved it
more than anything else.

499
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,960
And then one night,
he found out that...

500
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,171
he made a mistake
with one of them.

501
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,882
He couldn't help that one.

502
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,053
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

503
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:54,430
He can't forget.

504
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:59,893
Ever since then,
things have been different.

505
00:49:01,728 --> 00:49:04,689
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

506
00:49:06,483 --> 00:49:08,735
And his wife...

507
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,488
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

508
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:15,157
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

509
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:22,330
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

510
00:49:22,456 --> 00:49:26,084
A really cool little boy.

511

Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

512
00:49:31,464 --> 00:49:34,550
And Malcolm decides
to try and hello this new boy...

513
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,181
'cause he feels that
if he can hello this new boy,

514
00:49:41,306 --> 00:49:45,977
it will be like...
helqing that other one too.

in your bed tonight?

[Sobbing]
Oh.

650
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:41,506
It's Edwardian,
beautifully worked...

651

with mine-cut diamonds
and an actual color Burmese saqqhire.

a little qlainer ?

656
01:04:57,313 --> 01:05:02,025
Plainer ? You want a qlain ring
to go with your qlain fiiance?
Is that how it is?

657
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:05,987
No ! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.

658
01:05:08,198 --> 01:05:12,868
Uh--
You're so beautiful.

659
01:05:12,994 --> 01:05:16,664
You're like a Burmese saqqhire
all by yourself.

660
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:19,583
- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.

and see how you both
feel about it.

663
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,220
There. How does
that feel ?

664
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:37,599
I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.

665
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,727
I imagine that the woman
who owned it...

666
01:05:40,852 --> 01:05:43,939
loved a man that she
couldn't be with.

667
01:05:45,398 --> 01:05:48,526
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

668
01:05:48,651 --> 01:05:52,697
- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...

669
01:05:52,822 --> 01:05:55,699
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

670
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:59,244
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

671
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:05,500
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

672
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:09,045
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

673
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:12,882
like...
like fingerprints.

674
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:17,011
I'll just
wrap it uq.

675
01:06:23,934 --> 01:06:26,186
You don't need a guy
with a Master's.

676
01:06:26,311 --> 01:06:29,022
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

677
01:06:29,147 --> 01:06:32,316
[Chuckles]
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.

[Malcolm] I know what I want.

I want to be able to
talk to my wife again.

The way we used to
talk to each other.

692
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:36,000
Like there was no one else
in the world except us.

[Cole] How are you gonna do that?

Can't be your doctor
anymore.

695

I haven't qaid enough
attention to my family.

I know two psychologists.
- Don't fail me.

my secret, right?

It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die. "

they want?

-Just hello.
-That's right. That's what I think too.

01:18:39,483 --> 01:18:42,152
I guess she did.

791
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,019
[Sobbing]

792
01:19:28,152 --> 01:19:30,279
Can you get
some water ?

793
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:36,076
That's her sister.

794
01:19:53,926 --> 01:19:58,263
You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer--

795
01:19:58,389 --> 01:20:01,641
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

796
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:04,227
[Woman] How many--
How many doctors?

797
01:20:04,352 --> 01:20:07,230
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

798
01:20:07,355 --> 01:20:09,691
I think so, yes.

799
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:20,033
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

800
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:22,411
God hello them.

801
01:20:41,928 --> 01:20:44,431
Don't go home,
okay?

802
01:20:44,556 --> 01:20:46,975
I definitely won't.

803
01:21:42,234 --> 01:21:44,861
Aah !
[Panting]

804
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:47,794
Mister ?

805
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:53,174
Excuse me, mister.

806
01:22:57,511 --> 01:22:59,972
Are you
Kyra's daddy?

807
01:23:13,442 --> 01:23:16,987
It's for you.

808
01:23:17,112 --> 01:23:20,198
Sh-She wanted
to tell you something.

809

[Static]

810
01:23:58,317 --> 01:24:00,861
[Kyra's Voice] Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst !

811
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:08,409
Would you like to dance?

812
01:24:08,534 --> 01:24:12,455
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

813
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,999
Oh, well,
how about this?

814
01:24:15,124 --> 01:24:18,502
We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don't like the way I dance,

815
01:24:18,627 --> 01:24:20,545
you can kick me.

816
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:22,714
Oh, okay then.

817
01:25:19,183 --> 01:25:21,184
[Liquid Pouring]

818
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,990
[Woman] It's time for lunch, Kyra.

819
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:42,788
- [Kyra] I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.

820
01:25:42,913 --> 01:25:45,206
[Kisses]
It's time for your food.

821
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,419
Can I go outside
if I eat this?

822
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,921
I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.

823
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,799
We'll see.

824
01:25:56,467 --> 01:26:00,304
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

825
01:26:03,056 --> 01:26:07,227
Tami's mom called.

826
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:25,076
You were
keeping her sick.

827
01:26:41,967 --> 01:26:44,678
You liked it,
she said.

828
01:26:47,722 --> 01:26:50,725
She looked out
for you.

829
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:53,102
Is Kyra coming back?

830
01:26:56,272 --> 01:26:59,149
[Cole] Not anymore.

831
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,491
[Woman] I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.

832
01:27:08,616 --> 01:27:11,160
[Cole] Okay.

833
01:27:11,285 --> 01:27:14,955
- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry !

834
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,752
Who, uh--
Who were you talking to?

835
01:27:27,634 --> 01:27:30,636
Just practicing
my lines.

836
01:27:33,806 --> 01:27:36,558
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

837
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:40,395
You know, when I went to school
here, there was a terrible fire
in this section of the theater.

838
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,481
They rebuilt
the whole thing.

839
01:27:42,606 --> 01:27:45,525
Yeah, I know.

840
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:49,821
[Audience Sighing]

841
01:27:55,743 --> 01:28:00,622
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

842
01:28:00,747 --> 01:28:03,291
Let the boy try.

843
01:28:05,335 --> 01:28:07,462
[Scattered Applause]

844
01:28:10,506 --> 01:28:13,467
He is a stable boy.
He cleans uq after the horses.

845
01:28:13,592 --> 01:28:16,303
- Silence, village idiot.
- [Scattered Giggling]

846
01:28:16,428 --> 01:28:19,181
Let the boy
step forward.

[Chattering]

855
01:29:21,655 --> 01:29:24,532
[Malcolm] I thought you were
really great in the play, Cole.

856
01:29:24,658 --> 01:29:26,785
- Really?
- Yeah.

857
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:29,287
- You know what else?
- What?

858
01:29:29,412 --> 01:29:33,833
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big time. [Chuckles]

[Chuckles]

860
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:44,384
I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.

861
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:47,679
Wait till
she's asleep.

862
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:51,349
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

863
01:29:58,605 --> 01:30:01,775
I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I ?

864
01:30:03,944 --> 01:30:06,780
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

865
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:11,284
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

866
01:30:13,285 --> 01:30:16,372
Maybe we can qretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

867
01:30:18,707 --> 01:30:21,043
Just for qretend.

868
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,675
Okay.

869
01:30:33,888 --> 01:30:36,348
I'm gonna go now.

870
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,814
I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.

I'm okay, Officer.
l-I'm okay.

873
01:31:15,718 --> 01:31:17,970
I don't know
what happened.

874
01:31:23,308 --> 01:31:26,227
[Lynn] Hmm.

875
01:31:26,352 --> 01:31:29,439
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

876
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:35,736
You're very quiet.

877
01:31:35,861 --> 01:31:39,114
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

878
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:41,575
I have two jobs, baby.

879
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,619
You know how important
they are for us.

881
01:31:46,746 --> 01:31:49,123
I'd give anything
to have been there.

882
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:03,345
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

883
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,643
Communicate?

884
01:32:12,228 --> 01:32:14,563
Tell you my secrets.

885
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:18,609
What is it?

886
01:32:22,404 --> 01:32:25,156
You know the accident
uq there?

01:32:25,281 --> 01:32:28,243
Yeah.

888
01:32:28,368 --> 01:32:30,411
Someone got hurt.

889
01:32:30,536 --> 01:32:32,663
They did?

890
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:36,292
A lady.

891
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:38,627
She died.

892
01:32:38,752 --> 01:32:41,171
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her ?

893
01:32:42,672 --> 01:32:45,717
- Yes.
- Where is she?

894
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:53,182
Standing next to
my window.

895
01:32:59,313 --> 01:33:02,232
Cole, you're
scaring me.

896
01:33:02,357 --> 01:33:04,651
They scare me too
sometimes.

897
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,530
They?

898
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,326
Ghosts.

899
01:33:18,747 --> 01:33:21,208
You see ghosts, Cole?

900
01:33:23,376 --> 01:33:26,171
They want me to
do things for them.

901
01:33:29,048 --> 01:33:31,217
They--
They talk to you?

902
01:33:31,342 --> 01:33:34,428
They tell you
to do things?

903
01:33:35,554 --> 01:33:38,474
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

904
01:33:39,975 --> 01:33:42,686
What are you
thinking, Mama?

905
01:33:42,811 --> 01:33:47,440
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

906
01:33:47,565 --> 01:33:50,485
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

907
01:33:51,819 --> 01:33:54,238
- Got it?
- Got it.

908
01:34:01,578 --> 01:34:03,622
Just let me think
for a minute.

909
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:09,585
Grandma says hi.

910
01:34:13,089 --> 01:34:16,216
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

911
01:34:16,342 --> 01:34:18,969
She just
likes it a lot.

912
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:25,308
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

913
01:34:27,769 --> 01:34:30,438
Cole, that's
very wrong.

914
01:34:30,563 --> 01:34:33,107
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

915
01:34:33,232 --> 01:34:36,485
- She wanted me to tell you--
- Cole, please stop.

916
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:39,321
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

917
01:34:41,031 --> 01:34:44,618
She said
when you were little,

918
01:34:44,743 --> 01:34:46,619
you and her
had a fight...

919
01:34:46,744 --> 01:34:49,455
right before
your dance recital.

920
01:34:51,749 --> 01:34:56,420
- [Sniffles]
- You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.

921
01:35:00,299 --> 01:35:02,592
She did.

922
01:35:08,014 --> 01:35:11,809
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

923
01:35:11,934 --> 01:35:14,687
Sh-She said you were
like an angel.

- [Sobbing]
- She said...

925
01:35:21,568 --> 01:35:24,988
you came to the place
where they buried her,

926
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,659
asked her a question.

927
01:35:32,286 --> 01:35:36,498
She said
the answer is...

928
01:35:36,624 --> 01:35:38,542
every day.

929
01:35:41,211 --> 01:35:43,630

[Man] Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

938
01:36:35,594 --> 01:36:38,180
I'm not
used to doing this,

939
01:36:38,305 --> 01:36:41,892
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

940
01:36:42,017 --> 01:36:46,146
I'll leave that to her mother.
[Chuckles]

941
01:36:46,271 --> 01:36:48,398
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

942
01:36:48,523 --> 01:36:51,317
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

943
01:36:51,442 --> 01:36:54,236
It's bittersweet almost,
for me,

944
01:36:54,361 --> 01:36:56,530
'cause I hate
giving her up.

945
01:36:56,655 --> 01:36:58,782
[Malcolm] Anna?

[Applause On Television]

947
01:37:08,666 --> 01:37:10,585
I miss you.

I miss you too.

949
01:37:19,176 --> 01:37:21,928
