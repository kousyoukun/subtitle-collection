You know, you can tell me things
if you need to.

162
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,756
Well, you know
what I did today?

163
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:54,928
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning,

164
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,888
I quit my jobs,

165
00:20:57,014 --> 00:21:01,977
<i>and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.</i>

166
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:05,397
<i>And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.</i>

167
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:07,441
<i>What'd you do?</i>

168
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:16,283
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

169
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,285
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

170
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,456
<i>Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.</i>

171
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,380
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

172
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,425
You got an hour.

173
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:41,475
<i>[Malcolm] Hi.</i>

174
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,814
Wanna sit?

175
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,655
<i>Don't feel like
talking today?</i>

176
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,369
Wanna play a game?

177
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,331
<i>It's a mind-reading game.</i>

178
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,416
Here's how it works.

179
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,919
I read your mind.

180
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:12,297
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

181
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:16,426
<i>If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...</i>

182
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:18,428
<i>towards the doorway.</i>

183
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:22,057
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

184
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:25,978
If you reach the door,
you can go.

185
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,481
<i>Wanna play?</i>

186
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,657
<i>Okay.</i>

187
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:57,759
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

188
00:22:57,884 --> 00:23:02,139
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

189
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:05,350
<i>So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.</i>

190
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,038
You're worried that she said
she told him things...

191
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,457
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

192
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,710
Secrets.

193
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,261
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

194
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,737
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

195
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:12,084
He forgot it in a drawer.

196
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,086
Doesn't work.

197
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:29,559
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

198
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:34,481
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

199
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,699
<i>We were supposed
to draw a picture.</i>

200
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:45,951
Anything we wanted.

201
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:51,873
I drew a man.

202
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:54,918
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

203
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:01,258
You saw that on TV, Cole?

<i>[Footsteps]</i>

205

Everyone got upset.

206

They had a meeting.

207
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:13,145
Mom started crying.

208
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,731
<i>I don't draw
like that anymore.</i>

209
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:19,943
How do you draw now?

210
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:25,574
I draw... people smiling,

211
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,659
dogs running,

212
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,996
rainbows.

213
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:35,375
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

214
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,713
No. I guess they don't.

215
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,183
What am I thinking now?

216
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:54,811
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

221
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,721
I thought you meant the other Italian

[Sighs]

223

I'm so sorry, Anna.

224
00:26:40,273 --> 00:26:42,901
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

225
00:26:45,612 --> 00:26:48,615
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

226
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:55,831
They're both so similar.

227
00:26:55,956 --> 00:27:00,335
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

228
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,216
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

229
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:10,721
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

230
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,432
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

231
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,851
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

232
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:20,772
[Sighs]
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

233
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:25,610
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

234
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,991
Or I could just be wrong.

235
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,161
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

No.

Yes.

- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

255

- I don't want her to know.

You are not a freak.
Okay?

260
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,294
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

261
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,755
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

Okay?

<i>How come?</i>

275
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:58,949
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:04,162
<i>to express our feelings
about certain issues...</i>

divorce, whatever.

<i>[Cole] No.</i>

281
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:26,184
<i>[Malcolm] Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,</i>

282
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,648
<i>and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.</i>

283

<i>And you don't look

<i>You just keep

<i>And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough,</i>

<i>words and thoughts start coming out that

<i>It could be something
