165
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,285
I quit my jobs,

166
00:20:56,387 --> 00:21:01,256
and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

167
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:04,725
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

168
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,729
What'd you do?

169
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:15,628
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

170
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,640
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

171
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:21,769
Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

172
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:29,686
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

173
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:32,755
You got an hour.

174
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,787
[Malcolm] Hi.

175
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,167
Wanna sit?

176
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:54,006
Don't feel like
talking today?

177
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:59,679
Wanna play a game?

178
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:03,649
It's a mind-reading game.

179
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,722
Here's how it works.

180
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:08,256
I read your mind.

181
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,624
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

182
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:15,722
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

183
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,733
towards the doorway.

184
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:21,396
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

185
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:25,305
If you reach the door,
you can go.

186
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:28,811
Wanna play?

187
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,020
Okay.

188
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:57,138
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

189
00:22:57,241 --> 00:23:01,473
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

190
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:04,673
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

191
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:25,394
You're worried that she said
she told him things...

192
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,801
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

193
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,073
Secrets.

194
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,543
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

195
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:57,958
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

196
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:11,279
He forgot it in a drawer.

197
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,315
Doesn't work.

198
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:28,797
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

199
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:33,700
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

200
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:42,978
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

201
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,207
Anything we wanted.

202
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:51,154
I drew a man.

203
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:54,189
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

204
00:24:57,895 --> 00:25:00,523
You saw that on TV, Cole?

205
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:02,531
[Footsteps]

206
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,434
Everyone got upset.

207
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:10,335
They had a meeting.

208
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:12,341
Mom started crying.

209
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:14,934
I don't draw
like that anymore.

210
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,140
How do you draw now?

211
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:24,819
I draw... people smiling,

212
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,856
dogs running,

213
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,259
rainbows.

214
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:34,588
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

215
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,930
No. I guess they don't.

216
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:50,438
What am I thinking now?

217
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:54,039
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

218
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,222
I was thinking...

219
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,226
you're nice,

220
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,755
but you can't help me.

[Sighs]

222
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:28,976
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

223
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:36,083
[Sighs]

224
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:38,093
I'm so sorry, Anna.

225
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:42,157
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

226
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,837
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

227
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,142
They're both so similar.

228
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:59,545
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

229
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:05,454
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

230
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:09,958
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

231
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,654
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

232
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:15,061
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

233
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:20,068
[Sighs]
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

234
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,903
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

235
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:30,279
Or I could just be wrong.

236
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:33,407
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

237
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:44,053
[Sighs]
Anna.

238
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:48,465
I know that I've been
a little distant, all right?

239
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:51,693
I know that it makes you mad.
I just...

240
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:55,862
feel like I'm being given
a second chance, and
I don't want it to slip away.

I don't like when people
look at me like that.

- [Children Chattering]

I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,435
Is he your best buddy?

No.

set that up?

Yes.

Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

256

'Cause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

Hey.

You are not a freak.
Okay?

261
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:05,504
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

262
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:07,975
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

Okay?

[Malcolm] So your dad lives
in Pittsburgh with a lady...

[Cole] I wonder if she has to pee

Think she just holds it?

I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

00:30:50,113 --> 00:30:52,138
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

How come?

276
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:58,214
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

277
00:30:58,322 --> 00:31:03,453
to express our feelings
about certain issues...

278
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,893
divorce, whatever.

279
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,693
For example, a person might
leave something on the desk
for someone else to find.

280

Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

281
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:21,167
[Cole] No.

282
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,510
[Malcolm] Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

283
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:30,986
and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.

284
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:33,750
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

285
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:37,190
You just keep
your hand moving.

286
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:41,253
And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough,

287
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,765
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

288
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:50,306
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

289
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,705
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

that he fell asleep.

they were still driving.

Okay. Some twists.

Give me an example.

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,659
That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so...

Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

496
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,571
He worked with children.

497
00:48:32,241 --> 00:48:34,766
He loved it.

498
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:37,812
He loved it
more than anything else.

499
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:42,283
And then one night,
he found out that...

500
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:45,513
he made a mistake
with one of them.

501
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:48,181
He couldn't help that one.

502
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:52,385
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

503
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:54,725
He can't forget.

504
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,164
Ever since then,
things have been different.

505
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:04,939
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

506
00:49:06,742 --> 00:49:09,040
And his wife...

507
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:12,808
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

508
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:15,475
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

509
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:22,617
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

510
00:49:22,725 --> 00:49:26,388
A really cool little boy.

511

Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

512
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:34,827
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

513
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,499
'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

514
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:46,309
it will be like...
helping that other one too.

[Whimpering]

638
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:47,736
[Sobbing]
Sebastian, come on!

639
01:03:47,846 --> 01:03:51,873
- Mama?
- [Dog Whimpering]

640

[Sobbing]

641
01:03:56,388 --> 01:03:58,982
If you're not
very mad,

642
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,615
can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

643
01:04:03,528 --> 01:04:06,053
Look at my face.

644
01:04:06,164 --> 01:04:09,031
I'm not very mad.

645
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:15,734
- [Sobbing]
- Baby, why are you shaking?

646
01:04:17,008 --> 01:04:19,203
Cole, what's wrong?

647
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:23,076
Oh, God,
please tell me!

648
01:04:23,214 --> 01:04:26,581
Oh, please.

649
01:04:27,852 --> 01:04:30,412
[Sobbing]
Oh.

650
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:42,464
It's Edwardian,
beautifully worked...

651
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:47,595
with mine-cut diamonds
and an actual color Burmese sapphire.

652
01:04:47,705 --> 01:04:50,333
It's timeless.

- Oh.
- [Door Closes, Bells Jingling]

654

You, uh...
[Clears Throat]

655
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,142
Got anything
a little plainer?

656
01:04:58,283 --> 01:05:02,947
Plainer? You want a plain ring
to go with your plain fiance?
Is that how it is?

657
01:05:03,054 --> 01:05:06,888
No! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.

658
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:13,791
Uh...
You're so beautiful.

659
01:05:13,898 --> 01:05:17,595
You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

660
01:05:17,702 --> 01:05:20,500
- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.

661
01:05:20,605 --> 01:05:23,073
Why don't you
try it on...

662
01:05:23,174 --> 01:05:25,369
and see how you both
feel about it.

663
01:05:30,715 --> 01:05:34,173
There. How does
that feel?

664
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,585
I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.

665
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:41,682
I imagine that the woman
who owned it...

666
01:05:41,793 --> 01:05:44,853
Ioved a man that she
couldn't be with.

667
01:05:46,364 --> 01:05:49,492
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

668
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:53,662
- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...

669
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:56,706
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

670
01:05:56,808 --> 01:06:00,141
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

671
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:06,412
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

672
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:09,952
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

673
01:06:10,088 --> 01:06:13,785
like...
like fingerprints.

674
01:06:15,894 --> 01:06:17,953
I'll just
wrap it up.

675
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:27,133
You don't need a guy
with a Master's.

676
01:06:27,238 --> 01:06:29,968
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

677
01:06:30,074 --> 01:06:33,237
[Chuckles]
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.

678
01:06:34,412 --> 01:06:36,903
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

679
01:06:37,048 --> 01:06:39,380
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

680
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:51,023
It's a...
first edition.

681
01:06:51,129 --> 01:06:53,563
- Wow.
- [Chuckles]

682
01:06:53,665 --> 01:06:56,498
- You know, this is too much.
- No.

683
01:06:56,601 --> 01:06:58,466
Took it out of
your Christmas bonus.

684
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:02,802
[Chuckles]
It's perfect, Anna.

685

- Thanks.
- [Chuckles]

[Cole] What do you want
more than anything?

687
01:07:13,918 --> 01:07:16,113
[Malcolm] I don't know.

688
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:18,985
- [Cole] I've told you what I want.
- [Glass Breaking]

689
01:07:21,759 --> 01:07:23,659
[Malcolm] I know what I want.

690
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:28,593
I want to be able to
talk to my wife again.

691
01:07:30,935 --> 01:07:34,234
The way we used to
talk to each other.

692
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:36,967
Like there was no one else
in the world except us.

693
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:40,474
[Cole] How are you gonna do that?

694
01:07:46,684 --> 01:07:48,584
Can't be your doctor
anymore.

695
01:07:48,686 --> 01:07:53,214
I haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

696
01:07:53,324 --> 01:07:55,383
Bad things happen
when you do that.

697
01:07:57,228 --> 01:07:59,526
Do you understand?

698
01:07:59,631 --> 01:08:03,533
- I'm going to transfer you.
I know two psychologists.
- Don't fail me.

699
01:08:06,104 --> 01:08:08,664
Don't give up. You're the only one
who can help me, I know it.

700
01:08:10,408 --> 01:08:13,172
- I can't help you.
- [Sobbing]

701
01:08:14,379 --> 01:08:16,279
You...

702
01:08:16,381 --> 01:08:19,441
Someone else
can help you.

703
01:08:23,288 --> 01:08:26,280
You believe me, right?

704
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:32,221
Dr. Crowe, you believe
my secret, right?

705
01:08:34,465 --> 01:08:37,263
I don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

706
01:08:47,512 --> 01:08:50,413
How can you help me...

707
01:08:50,515 --> 01:08:53,177
if you don't believe me?

708
01:08:56,888 --> 01:09:00,915

afraid when you're alone?

Vincent,
why are you crying?

[Vincent Sniffles] You won't believe.

717
01:09:57,815 --> 01:10:01,876
[Malcolm] Sorry, Vincent. I hope
I didn't leave you alone too long.

722

When I was a kid,
I had this blood test done,

- and I threw up chili cheese
fries all over this male nurse.

excuse me? I have to take this.

Want to be a lance corporal in Company
"M," Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

Yes.
I think I am.

Do you know what
"Yo no quiero morir" means?

749
01:13:09,173 --> 01:13:12,506
It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die."

750
01:13:15,212 --> 01:13:17,772
What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

751
01:13:25,923 --> 01:13:28,050
I want you to
think about it, Cole.

752

I want you to think about it
really carefully.

753

What do you think
they want?

754
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:44,039
- Just help.
- That's right. That's what I think too.

755
01:13:44,141 --> 01:13:46,541
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

to make them go away.

don't want help?

What if they're just angry and they
just want to hurt somebody?

01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:37,059
That's her sister.

794
01:19:54,912 --> 01:19:59,281
You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer...

795
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:02,648
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

796
01:20:02,753 --> 01:20:05,244
[Woman] How many...
How many doctors?

797
01:20:05,356 --> 01:20:08,257
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

798
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:10,725
I think so, yes.

799
01:20:16,633 --> 01:20:21,036
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

800
01:20:21,171 --> 01:20:23,469
God help them.

801
01:20:42,993 --> 01:20:45,484
Don't go home,
okay?

802
01:20:45,596 --> 01:20:48,064
I definitely won't.

803
01:21:43,287 --> 01:21:45,949
Aah!
[Panting]

804
01:22:46,483 --> 01:22:48,849
Mister?

805
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:54,254
Excuse me, mister.

806
01:22:58,529 --> 01:23:00,997
Are you
Kyra's daddy?

807
01:23:14,511 --> 01:23:18,072
It's for you.

808
01:23:18,182 --> 01:23:21,276
Sh-She wanted
to tell you something.

809
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:57,151
[Static]

810
01:23:59,256 --> 01:24:01,816
[Kyra's Voice] Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!

811
01:24:06,496 --> 01:24:09,397
Would you like to dance?

812
01:24:09,499 --> 01:24:13,435
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

813
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:16,004
Oh, well,
how about this?

814
01:24:16,106 --> 01:24:19,542
We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don't like the way I dance,

815
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:21,577
you can kick me.

816
01:24:21,678 --> 01:24:23,703
Oh, okay then.

817
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:22,161
[Liquid Pouring]

818
01:25:33,817 --> 01:25:37,014
[Woman] It's time for lunch, Kyra.

819
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:43,854
- [Kyra] I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.

820
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,224
[Kisses]
It's time for your food.

821
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:50,460
Can I go outside
if I eat this?

822
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,966
I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.

823
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,834
We'll see.

824
01:25:57,474 --> 01:26:01,274
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

825
01:26:04,014 --> 01:26:08,212
Tami's mom called.

826
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,066
You were
keeping her sick.

827
01:26:42,953 --> 01:26:45,649
You liked it,
she said.

828
01:26:48,692 --> 01:26:51,752
She looked out
for you.

829
01:26:51,862 --> 01:26:54,126
Is Kyra coming back?

830
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,133
[Cole] Not anymore.

831
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:09,474
[Woman] I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.

832
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:12,173
[Cole] Okay.

833
01:27:12,282 --> 01:27:15,911
- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry!

834
01:27:19,456 --> 01:27:21,720
Who, uh...
Who were you talking to?

835
01:27:28,632 --> 01:27:31,624
Just practicing
my lines.

836
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:37,602
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

837
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:41,438
You know, when I went to school
here, there was a terrible fire
in this section of the theater.

838
01:27:41,545 --> 01:27:43,536
They rebuilt
the whole thing.

839
01:27:43,647 --> 01:27:46,548
Yeah, I know.

840
01:27:48,118 --> 01:27:50,814
[Audience Sighing]

841
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,561
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

842
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:04,223
Let the boy try.

843
01:28:06,303 --> 01:28:08,396
[Scattered Applause]

844
01:28:11,508 --> 01:28:14,500
He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

845
01:28:14,611 --> 01:28:17,341
- Silence, village idiot.
- [Scattered Giggling]

846
01:28:17,447 --> 01:28:20,211
Let the boy
step forward.

847
01:28:44,774 --> 01:28:47,607
[Children Gasping]

848
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:50,544
[Children Together]
Hail, King Arthur!

849
01:28:50,647 --> 01:28:53,810
[Applause]

850
01:28:55,285 --> 01:28:57,185
[Children] Yea!

851
01:28:57,287 --> 01:29:00,745
- [Cheering]

[Chattering]

855
01:29:22,612 --> 01:29:25,513
[Malcolm] I thought you were
really great in the play, Cole.

856
01:29:25,615 --> 01:29:27,742
- Really?
- Yeah.

857
01:29:27,851 --> 01:29:30,251
- You know what else?
- What?

858
01:29:30,353 --> 01:29:34,756
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big time. [Chuckles]

859
01:29:34,858 --> 01:29:37,486
[Chuckles]

860
01:29:42,032 --> 01:29:45,365
I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.

861
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:48,699
Wait till
she's asleep.

862
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:52,297
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

863
01:29:59,683 --> 01:30:02,846
I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I?

864
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:07,821
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

865
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:12,351
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

866
01:30:14,364 --> 01:30:17,424
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

867
01:30:19,836 --> 01:30:22,134
Just for pretend.

868
01:30:28,411 --> 01:30:30,777
Okay.

869
01:30:34,985 --> 01:30:37,453
I'm gonna go now.

870
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,892
I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.

871
01:31:06,182 --> 01:31:08,946
- [Siren Blaring]
- [Chattering, Indistinct]

872
01:31:13,123 --> 01:31:16,650
I'm okay, Officer.
L-I'm okay.

873
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,990
I don't know
what happened.

874
01:31:24,367 --> 01:31:27,268
[Lynn] Hmm.

875
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:30,464
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

876
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:36,804
You're very quiet.

877
01:31:36,946 --> 01:31:40,177
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

878
01:31:40,316 --> 01:31:42,682
I have two jobs, baby.

879
01:31:42,786 --> 01:31:45,721
You know how important
they are for us.

880
01:31:45,822 --> 01:31:47,722
[Sighs]

881
01:31:47,824 --> 01:31:50,224
I'd give anything
to have been there.

882
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:04,369
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

883
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,670
Communicate?

884
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:15,615
Tell you my secrets.

885
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,654
What is it?

886
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:26,224
You know the accident
up there?

887
01:32:26,329 --> 01:32:29,321
Yeah.

888
01:32:29,432 --> 01:32:31,491
Someone got hurt.

889
01:32:31,601 --> 01:32:33,762
They did?

890
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:37,362
A lady.

891
01:32:37,474 --> 01:32:39,738
She died.

892
01:32:39,843 --> 01:32:42,243
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?

893
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:46,772
- Yes.
- Where is she?

894
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:54,288
Standing next to
my window.

895
01:33:00,363 --> 01:33:03,298
Cole, you're
scaring me.

896
01:33:03,399 --> 01:33:05,663
They scare me too
sometimes.

897
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:10,568
They?

898
01:33:13,476 --> 01:33:15,376
Ghosts.

899
01:33:19,816 --> 01:33:22,250
You see ghosts, Cole?

900
01:33:24,487 --> 01:33:27,285
They want me to
do things for them.

901
01:33:30,093 --> 01:33:32,254
They...
They talk to you?

902
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:35,422
They tell you
to do things?

903
01:33:36,566 --> 01:33:39,467
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

904
01:33:41,004 --> 01:33:43,734
What are you
thinking, Mama?

905
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,436
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

906
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:51,514
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

907
01:33:52,849 --> 01:33:55,249
- Got it?
- Got it.

908
01:34:02,559 --> 01:34:04,584
Just let me think
for a minute.

909
01:34:08,498 --> 01:34:10,557
Grandma says hi.

910
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:17,198
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

911
01:34:17,307 --> 01:34:19,935
She just
likes it a lot.

912
01:34:22,412 --> 01:34:26,314
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

913
01:34:28,785 --> 01:34:31,481
Cole, that's
very wrong.

914
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:34,113
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

915
01:34:34,224 --> 01:34:37,523
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Cole, please stop.

916
01:34:37,627 --> 01:34:40,357
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

917
01:34:42,031 --> 01:34:45,626
She said
when you were little,

918
01:34:45,735 --> 01:34:47,635
you and her
had a fight...

919
01:34:47,737 --> 01:34:50,467
right before
your dance recital.

920
01:34:52,742 --> 01:34:57,441
- [Sniffles]
- You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.

921
01:35:01,284 --> 01:35:03,616
She did.

922
01:35:08,992 --> 01:35:12,792
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

923
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:15,694
Sh-She said you were
like an angel.

924
01:35:20,336 --> 01:35:22,429
- [Sobbing]
- She said...

925
01:35:22,538 --> 01:35:25,996
you came to the place
where they buried her,

926
01:35:28,244 --> 01:35:30,678
asked her a question.

927
01:35:33,316 --> 01:35:37,582
She said
the answer is...

928
01:35:37,687 --> 01:35:39,587
every day.

929
01:35:42,225 --> 01:35:44,693
What did you ask?

930
01:35:44,794 --> 01:35:47,991
[Sniffles]

[Voice Breaking]

932
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:55,866
Do...

933
01:35:55,972 --> 01:35:59,567
Do I make her proud?

934
01:36:02,078 --> 01:36:04,546
[Sobbing]
Mama.

935
01:36:09,319 --> 01:36:11,685

[Laughing, Chattering]

937
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:36,501
[Man] Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

938
01:36:36,612 --> 01:36:39,206
I'm not
used to doing this,

939
01:36:39,315 --> 01:36:42,944
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

940
01:36:43,052 --> 01:36:47,148
I'll leave that to her mother.
[Chuckles]

941
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:49,451
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

942
01:36:49,592 --> 01:36:52,390
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

943
01:36:52,495 --> 01:36:55,293
It's bittersweet almost,
for me,

944
01:36:55,398 --> 01:36:57,559
'cause I hate
giving her up.

945
01:36:57,667 --> 01:36:59,726
[Malcolm] Anna?

946
01:37:01,004 --> 01:37:03,564
[Applause On Television]

947
01:37:09,612 --> 01:37:11,512
I miss you.

948
01:37:17,453 --> 01:37:20,013
I miss you too.

949
01:37:20,123 --> 01:37:22,887
Why, Malcolm?

950
01:37:23,026 --> 01:37:25,756
What?

951
01:37:27,563 --> 01:37:31,158
- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?

952
01:37:31,267 --> 01:37:34,532
I didn't leave you.

[Cole] I see people.

955
01:37:59,028 --> 01:38:01,462
They don't know
they're dead.

956
01:38:05,668 --> 01:38:10,401
- [Malcolm] How often
do you see them?
- [Cole] All the time.

957
01:38:13,109 --> 01:38:14,974
[Cole] They're everywhere.

958
01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:28,857
They only see
what they want to see.

959
01:38:34,297 --> 01:38:37,789
[Malcolm On TV] Okay, Mikey.

960
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:41,165
Come on.
Give me a minute.

[Whimpering]

968
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:21,506
- Oh, God.
- [Groaning]

969
01:39:21,611 --> 01:39:25,240
- [Mumbling] It doesn't even hurt.

[Sobbing]

975
01:39:59,849 --> 01:40:03,649
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went...

976
01:40:03,753 --> 01:40:06,051
went in and out.

977
01:40:09,158 --> 01:40:12,286
It doesn't even
hurt anymore.

978
01:40:41,757 --> 01:40:44,191
I think
I can go now.

979
01:40:47,997 --> 01:40:50,397
I just needed
to do a couple things.

I needed
to help someone.

01:41:09,018 --> 01:41:11,714
And I needed
to tell you something.

You were never second.

984

Ever.

01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,228
I love you.

01:41:32,842 --> 01:41:35,037
You sleep now.

987
01:41:36,946 --> 01:41:39,506
Everything will be
different in the morning.

01:41:45,688 --> 01:41:48,623
Good night,
