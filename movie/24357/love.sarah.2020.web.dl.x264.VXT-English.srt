00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>Hi, this is Sarah.</i>

3
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,745
<i>Sorry, I can't
take your call right now.</i>

4
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:31,114
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

5
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,551
Hello, Sarah,
it's Isabella calling.

6
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:37,387
Yeah, I'm outside our bakery,
waiting for you.

7
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,222
So hurry up and get here, okay,

8
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,625
'cause I'm freezing
my bloody arse off.

9
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:00,745
OK,
everyone. Positions, please!

10
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:07,251
<i>Hi, this is Sarah.</i>

11
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:10,888
<i>Sarah, congratulations.</i>

12
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,221
<i>Today's the day, right?</i>

13
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:13,656
<i>Uh, you got the keys?</i>

14
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,325
<i>It's gonna be
the best bakery ever.</i>

15
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,653
"My dearest Sarah,

16
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:46,856
I'm sorry we haven't spoken
for so long.

17
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,593
I've been dreadfully stubborn
and for that I'm not proud."

18
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:01,871
1, 2, down, nice.

19
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:05,209
Hip up, shoulder bump.

20
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,977
Down, 1, 2.

21
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,483
Down, lift, up, and right, left,

22
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:16,286
right, up, and cut,

23
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,054
and step strong.

24
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,393
Mimi Curachi?

25
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:59,128
Yes.

26
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,725
There's nothing I can do.

27
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,028
But one of us is dead.

28
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,896
But it's a joint lease,
you know that.

29
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,465
You both signed the contract.

30
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:37,334
But she was the chef.

31
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:39,670
I'm not a chef.

32
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:41,704
I mean, it's kind of
like opening up a zoo

33
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:43,839
and saying, "Come on in,
but guess what,

34
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:46,475
there's no animals."

35
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,843
Well, can't you find a new one?

36
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:49,579
Uh, someone as good as Sarah.

37
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:52,214
Oh, she was famous.

38
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:53,082
She trained with Ottolenghi!

39
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:54,317
I don't know how it works.

40
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,920
Huh!

41
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,693
I'll tell you how it works.

42
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:04,360
You sit there
all cheerily, smiling,

43
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:05,528
"Look how big my balls are,"

44
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:07,898
and then
my best friend is killed.

45
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,366
My investors pull out,
because their star chef is dead,

46
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,569
I'm losing all my savings
while the place sits empty,

47
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:15,271
and now...
now that it's all gone tits up,

48
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,206
you're sitting there
and you're telling me,

49
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,709
"There's nothing I can do."

50
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:38,361
Look, really, genuinely,
I am sorry for your loss.

51
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,029
You signed
the agreement together

52
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:42,699
and I will do my best...
my absolute best

53
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:45,369
to try and re-let the place,
but you know yourself it...

54
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,437
it was empty for a long time
and uh...

55
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,407
I wish there was
something more I could say.

56
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,047
Okay,
everyone, positions please.

57
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,596
Nice and calm.

58
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,767
Breathing on 5, 6, go 7.

59
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,572
And you just say 1 and 2.

60
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:57,706
Down 3.

61
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,177
Open back full, nice.

62
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,478
5 and 6.

63
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:04,247
Round.

64
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,714
Clarissa?

65
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:10,519
And 1, 2, and 3.

66
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:12,255
4.

67
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:16,258
And 3, and 4.

68
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,326
Clarissa?

69
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,629
- Hey, what's...
- I'm sorry.

71
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,197
What's going on?

72
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:23,834
Hey.

73
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,652
<i>Playing first message</i>

74
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:19,389
<i>left today at 4:16 p.m.</i>

75
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,458
<i>Mimi?</i>

76
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,627
<i>Hi, it's Olga here.</i>

77
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,463
<i>Um, I hope you're okay.</i>

78
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,502
<i>I... I just wondered if maybe you
fancied poker on Tuesday.</i>

79
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:35,372
<i>Y... we...
we'd all love to see you.</i>

80
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:38,274
<i>Um, anyway, let me know.</i>

81
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,442
<i>Take care, bye.</i>

82
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,865
Didn't hear from you all day.

83
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:05,735
I was worried about you.

84
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:10,706
Clarissa, are you gonna talk
to me at some point?

85
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:17,647
Sometimes I wonder whether
I'm a boyfriend or a bedroom.

86
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,014
I know
you're havin' a hard time.

87
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:21,384
This isn't just about you,
it's about us.

88
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:26,956
We're not happy anymore.

89
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:32,528
Are you breakin' up with me?

90
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:38,302
Oh my God,
you are breaking up with me.

91
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,338
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:51,814
I have nowhere to go.

93
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:19,541
<i>Hi, Clarie.</i>

94
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,811
<i>Just checking in.</i>

95
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,879
<i>Yeah, I just... I wanted
to let you know</i>

96
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:29,885
<i>I've finally have some interest
in the bakery.</i>

97
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,721
<i>Nothing is confirmed yet,
but there is this guy</i>

98
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:33,789
<i>who wants to...</i>

99
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:38,160
<i>Huh, open up
a pop-up wine bar.</i>

100
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:40,963
<i>Oh God, I know this is not
what Sarah would have wanted.</i>

101
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:42,831
<i>I mean
it's not what I want either.</i>

102
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:47,269
<i>Supposed to be a bakery,
our bakery.</i>

103
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:48,304
<i>Sarah hated wine.</i>

104
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:51,341
<i>She drank beer, anyway.</i>

105
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:55,745
<i>But, I don't know I...</i>

106
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:57,848
<i>I probably should agree to it.</i>

107
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,907
Everything's fine.

108
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,941
It doesn't look fine to me.

109
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:26,609
Honestly, I promise.

110
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:29,312
You know this girl?

111
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,480
Yeah.

112
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:34,451
Yeah, she's my... she's my niece.

113
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:35,752
You don't know
if she's your niece.

114
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:38,754
Well,
she's my best friend's daughter.

115
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:41,390
And where's your friend?

116
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:43,326
She died.

117
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:48,831
Thank you.

118
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,182
Get up, Larie.

119
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:08,051
Come on.

120
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:24,701
Hi, can I help you, madam?

121
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,836
Uh, no, it's fine.

122
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:39,549
- Mimi!
- Olga, hi.

123
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:41,717
How are you, stranger?

124
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,422
Well, you know, same old,
you know.

125
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:48,124
Listen, uh, it's yoga at 4:00.

126
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:49,325
Do you fancy it?

127
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,427
It'd be great to see you.

128
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:53,028
Well, no, I...

129
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:54,197
I don't think so.

130
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,466
It's been so long
and I'm completely out of shape.

131
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,701
Rubbish, look at you.

132
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:01,370
4:00, okay?

133
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:05,274
And then we'll go for coffee
after, like old times.

134
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:06,375
I'll see you at 4:00.

135
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,711
Okay.

136
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:24,461
So you wanna tell me
what's going on?

137
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:25,562
Has something happened
with Alex?

138
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,330
I thought you guys were
living together.

139
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,035
It wasn't workin' out.

140
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,070
I suppose you could stay
at mine.

141
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:37,006
There's no space.

142
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:38,841
There's a sofa.
I mean, I know it's not ideal.

143
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,476
Honestly, it is totally fine.

144
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,412
Well, it's obviously not, is it?

145
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:46,917
What the hell are you gonna do?

146
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:53,956
There is somebody
I could still try.

147
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,499
<i>There she is again.</i>

148
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:05,201
<i>Magical Mimi Curachi.</i>

149
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:08,771
<i>Celebrating 12 years
on the trapeze today.</i>

150
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:11,073
<i>With this surprise show,</i>

151
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:14,009
<i>she is proving
to her fans once again...</i>

152
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:17,214
<i>What an incomparable star
she is.</i>

153
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,031
Sure you're gonna be okay?

154
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:37,234
Mmhmm.

155
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:44,072
- Will you come in?
- No.

156
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,612
I haven't seen Mimi
in a long time.

157
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,568
Milk?

158
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:15,538
Do you have any soy milk?

159
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:19,975
That's fine.

160
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:36,793
I'm sorry, I haven't visited.

161
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:41,497
I did intend to, but, um...

162
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,732
...I just think living
in London,

163
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:46,602
time goes by and the things
that you meant to do

164
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:49,805
like the coffees,
and the visits, and everything,

165
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,374
you just...
you look at your diary

166
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:53,442
and suddenly it's October and...

167
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:55,144
Yeah.

168
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,250
Are you going to tell me
the reason

169
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:03,519
for this visit, Clarissa

170
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:05,221
or are we going to have
to battle our way

171
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,023
through this small talk?

172
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:12,862
Can't um, a granddaughter
visit a grandma?

173
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:15,063
Yes, a granddaughter can.

174
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,732
Pity she hasn't.

175
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:20,470
Oh God, that is very hot.

176
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:22,572
How much do you want?

177
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,173
What?

178
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:26,375
How much?

179
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:28,811
Do you really think this is
about money?

180
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:30,647
Look, I haven't seen you

181
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,947
for God knows how long.

182
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,750
You come in here unannounced.

183
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:35,784
Of course it's about money.

184
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:38,687
I need a place to stay.

185
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:47,330
Oh well, that's different.

186
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,116
So heavy.

187
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:10,519
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

188
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:11,587
Thanks for your help.

189
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,122
Bye-bye.

190
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:16,425
Hi.

191
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,461
Hi.

192
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,565
Ow!

193
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:23,598
- Careful, that...
- Oh, sorry.

194
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:24,600
Ow, Jesus!

195
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,635
Why is that right
in the doorway?

196
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:27,804
I wasn't expecting you
to have...

197
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:29,571
Really quite cramped
around here.

198
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:32,842
Yes, I didn't expect you
to have quite so...

199
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,809
So much.

200
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,579
Okay, this is it.

201
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,048
Uh...

202
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,349
It's fine.

203
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,086
Okay.

204
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:44,319
- Careful.
- Oh, sorry!

205
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:45,755
Ow, Jes...

206
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:54,330
Oh, for heaven...

207
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,635
Turn down that fuckin' music!

208
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:13,649
Did you sleep well?

209
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:15,951
Yeah, thanks.

210
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,258
Um, I'm going for a run.

211
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:26,695
There's a key on the side.

212
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,070
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

213
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:36,632
<i>I'm outside
our bakery, waiting for you.</i>

214
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:37,799
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

215
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,835
<i>It's not what
Sarah wanted.</i>

216
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,336
<i>But one of us is dead.</i>

217
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:43,238
...these stock
auctions, the quarter 4, 2018,

218
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:46,708
there is a clear parallel
in the figures from quarter 1

219
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,411
to quarter f...

220
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:54,049
4 of 2018.

221
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,687
And what we need to do is
capitalize on that growth and...

222
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,922
Hello, I'm so sorry.

223
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:02,224
Isabella, could I just talk
to you for a minute?

224
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:04,160
I'm really sorry, I won't
take her from the meeting

225
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,694
for very long on this...
on this one.

226
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,395
Excuse me, sorry.

227
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,165
Excuse me.

228
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:10,266
Thanks.

229
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,738
Do you know how hard
it was to get this job back?

230
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,771
Yes, I know, but...

231
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:19,307
I had to beg.
I'm 39 years old.

232
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,775
Do you know how that feels?

233
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:22,644
- Don't do it.
- What?

234
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:23,846
The wine bar.

235
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:25,146
Let's open the bakery.

236
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:28,450
What are you talking about?

237
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,418
You and me, think about it.

238
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,387
Yeah, 'cause it's that simple.

239
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:34,190
But yeah, of course, it is.

240
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:39,661
Okay, so...

241
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:42,163
...this is
where we're at financially.

242
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:44,933
- Is that pounds?
- Yeah, but that's nothing.

243
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:49,972
I mean, there's costs, set up,
insurance, materials.

244
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:52,208
The only way of making
any money on this place

245
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,743
is by actually selling food.

246
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:56,511
Without a baker...

247
00:20:56,545 --> 00:21:00,783
Somebody as good as Sarah,
we're nowhere.

248
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,884
- Larie.
- Yes.

249
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,687
- You getting this?
- Um, yeah, uh, sort of.

250
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,722
I need to know
that you understand

251
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:09,859
the full scale
of the thing, you know?

252
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,559
Mmhmm.

253
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:13,329
Oh my God,
this isn't gonna work.

254
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:16,032
This is not gonna work.

255
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:21,904
I can get the money.

256
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:31,413
Please just tell me
where we're going.

257
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,049
You're gonna find out soon
and trust me.

258
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,451
- You're going to enjoy it.
- I won't.

259
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,451
- Oh my God.
- I won't.

260
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:37,519
Okay.

261
00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:38,554
I didn't want
to come out anyway.

262
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,623
Should we leave it?

263
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:42,857
Hello, everybody,
welcome to Flying Fantastic.

264
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:45,528
My name is Jen,
I'll be your instructor today.

265
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,429
For those of you I haven't met
uh,

266
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:50,132
this is
an intermediate-level class,

267
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:53,903
so I'm assuming you all have
a little bit of prior know-how.

268
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:54,903
Yes.

269
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:56,871
Great, let's get started.

270
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:05,181
This is ridiculous.

271
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:06,715
This was your life.

272
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:08,483
A long time ago.

273
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,152
- I'm past it.
- Sshh!

274
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:13,923
Rubbish, you're in the prime
of your life.

275
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,090
Hardly.

276
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:17,259
So long as you've
got your incontinence pads on.

277
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:29,171
Very strong.

278
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:31,673
That's... that's really nice.
Okay, so bring the hand...

279
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:33,642
Yes, I know what I'm doing,
actually. Thank you.

280
00:22:43,285 --> 00:22:44,420
Yeah, that's it.

281
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:47,088
So if you just sit to the side
and this will... lay back.

282
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:48,157
- That's it.
- No!

283
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,990
- Good, so...
- No!

284
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:50,859
- Re...
- She's got the wrong arm up!

285
00:22:50,893 --> 00:22:52,228
- And her bum's sticking out.
- Okay, just reach...

286
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,596
- Wait.
- Excuse me, sorry...

287
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:56,398
Yes, but...
look, tuck your bum in,

288
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:58,634
change arms.

289
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,302
There. You see?
Like that.

290
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:02,605
Just like that.

291
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:04,072
I can't believe you, Mimi.

292
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:05,106
Hmm, what?

293
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,009
The look on their faces.

294
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,811
Oh dear,
I hope I wasn't too rude.

295
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:13,315
Yeah, you definitely were.

296
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:14,916
Oh, my thighs.

297
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,119
I'm not gonna be able to walk
for a week!

298
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:19,587
Well, you look like
you haven't forgotten a thing.

299
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:23,125
Maybe you should look
at getting back into it.

300
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:24,492
Thank you.

301
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:27,229
Maybe I will.

302
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,931
When I looked across at you,

303
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:30,799
you are going back
to your company, aren't you?

304
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:38,174
We're gonna open the bakery,
me and Isabella.

305
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:45,848
We need some financial help.

306
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:48,483
Yes, I wondered.

307
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:50,385
- What?
- What a shame.

308
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,555
I thought you and I had some...

309
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:54,824
Ugh!

310
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:57,657
Take her to a trapeze class,
butter her up,

311
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,929
- I'm not stupid, Clarissa.
- What?

312
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,963
Mum's gone now and the... oh,
there were just

313
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:04,166
so many wasted years
between you two.

314
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:06,769
And the least you could do
is come and have a look.

315
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:14,410
- Uh.
- Good morning.

316
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:15,978
Hey.

317
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:18,947
Mimi.

318
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,715
Isabella.

319
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:22,250
You look well.

320
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:36,598
This?

321
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:38,234
You want money for this?

322
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,836
Okay, so it does look
a bit rough at the moment,

323
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,904
but you can definitely see
its potential.

324
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:45,708
What?
As a crack den?

325
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,109
Okay, ladies,
picture this, right?

326
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,913
A big table, and a bar,

327
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:53,581
and then
big industrial coffee machine,

328
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:55,984
and "Oh, what's that smell?"

329
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:57,385
Cat's piss.

330
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,653
No, it's not cat's piss.

331
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:01,156
Croissants, fresh from the oven.

332
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,359
Yes, but what do you
two girls really know

333
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:04,860
about opening a bakery?

334
00:25:04,893 --> 00:25:06,562
I'm sorry,
did you just call us "girls"?

335
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:07,630
This is what she does.

336
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,597
It's what she always does.

337
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:11,867
What about your circus, okay?

338
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,869
You started that from scratch.

339
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:16,404
If anyone knows
how to steer a ship, it's you.

340
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,541
I'm not falling for that.

341
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:21,677
Look, are you in or out?

342
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:25,214
Okay, ladies,
if we are going to do this,

343
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:27,550
we are going to have
to get along, okay?

344
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,518
Mum would have wanted us
to open this bakery,

345
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,053
so that is
what we're going to do.

346
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:33,855
Together.

347
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:01,317
<i>Hello.</i>

348
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:04,086
Isabella?

349
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:07,055
<i>Mimi.</i>

350
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:10,393
Well, you're gonna let me in
or what?

351
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh.

352
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:30,947
I should have called.

353
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:36,584
It... it's just that I was...

354
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:39,955
I was so nearby, I thought...

355
00:26:50,598 --> 00:26:52,634
You know...

356
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,971
Clarissa is
just like her mother.

357
00:26:57,071 --> 00:27:00,808
And Sarah was just like hers.

358
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:03,211
What?
You mean stubborn?

359
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:17,859
I know I let you
and Sarah down before.

360
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:28,436
But she wouldn't
have wanted this, would she?

361
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,471
Me?

362
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:36,912
That's all she ever wanted.

363
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:04,173
I'm gonna clear this,

364
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:06,074
because uh, I just want
to have the floor here.

365
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:07,710
You can put
that in the back...

366
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:09,510
- Everything... yeah...
- Yeah.

367
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:10,979
Let the dog see the rabbit
as they say.

368
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,614
- Yeah, exactly.
- I'm good.

369
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:14,883
- To the back. More of a mess.
- I know.

370
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:16,585
I want to get
the floor clear.

371
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:18,886
No, it does need paint.

372
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,255
- Can we just clear this?
- Yes.

373
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:23,459
- Right out of the way.
- To the back.

374
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,374
You're...

375
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:39,407
So I was the head chef

376
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:40,709
over at St. Mary's School
for Girls.

377
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:42,009
You know, nothing fancy.

378
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:43,878
Jam roly-polys,
that sort of thing.

379
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:45,047
Not that the girls
really cared much.

380
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,781
They just vommed it all up
in the toilets.

381
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:49,184
Yeah.

382
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,189
Just put it up in
position, 'cause I can't tell.

383
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:01,697
So long as I'm home by 6:00.
I cannot break my curfew.

384
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:09,238
My starting salary is 45,000
with 35 days' leave.

385
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,173
Obviously,
not including public holidays.

386
00:29:12,207 --> 00:29:15,177
And I don't work nights
or weekends.

387
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,593
I'm here about the baking job.

388
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:33,895
- Is it still available?
- Get out, Matthew.

389
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:35,798
Warm welcome.

390
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,031
The position's been filled.

391
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:39,000
Really?

392
00:29:40,234 --> 00:29:42,170
You sure?

393
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:43,672
Thank you.

394
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:45,339
Leave the way you came.

395
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:47,976
Look.

396
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:51,579
I'm serious.

397
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:54,316
Is someone going to explain?

398
00:29:54,348 --> 00:29:56,284
You must be Clarissa.

399
00:29:56,317 --> 00:29:57,653
Hi.

400
00:29:57,685 --> 00:29:59,754
This is Matthew Gregory.
We trained together.

401
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:01,190
I was a friend of your mum's.

402
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:02,557
Oh, uh, you're a chef.

403
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,858
I am, Michelin-starred.

404
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:05,494
You're not Michelin-starred,
your restaurant is,

405
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,764
and you weren't her friend,
just a pretentious womanizer.

406
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:10,598
Well, I'm not one to boast,

407
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:11,667
it's actually
two-Michelin starred.

408
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:15,537
- Aren't you at Trois Amis?
- Yeah.

409
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:16,838
Why would you wanna leave?

410
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:19,875
Well, you know,
I fancy a challenge.

411
00:30:19,907 --> 00:30:21,576
Then climb Kilimanjaro maybe,

412
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,411
I don't know, take up crochet.

413
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:24,812
Alright, look, I'm after...

414
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,684
A bit more creative control.

415
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:32,688
Alright,
so you wanna come here, why?

416
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:34,690
The stuff that you make,
it's not really in our range.

417
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:37,659
I can make anything!

418
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:45,700
Listen, he and Sarah
had proper history.

419
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,502
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

420
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:48,769
Oh, don't be daft.

421
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:50,906
You can't turn down a chef
with a Michelin star.

422
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:52,074
Two Michelin stars.

423
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:53,575
We want this to be
a success, don't we?

424
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,977
Let's go for the best.

425
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:11,193
Presenting Ispahan.

426
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:13,662
Bless you.

427
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:16,564
It's a rose macaron
filled with rose petal

428
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:19,000
and lychee crémière
and fresh raspberries.

429
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:20,135
Hmm.

430
00:31:23,637 --> 00:31:25,273
I wanna try it.

431
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:37,184
The batter's undermixed.

432
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:38,620
Sorry?

433
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:41,690
Not by much, but it could do
with a few more folds.

434
00:31:47,095 --> 00:31:48,430
Okay, yeah, do you...
do you need me

435
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:49,798
to be here for that?

436
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,032
Somebody will be here.

437
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,167
Okay.

438
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:15,691
Orange wellhorn,
a chocolate mousse

439
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:17,525
sitting on a crunchy
chocolate samblé,

440
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:19,360
finished
with a mirrored chocolate glaze

441
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:20,929
and crunchy chocolate pearls.

442
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:23,198
Is there a simpler way
of saying that?

443
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,566
Mousse on a biscuit.

444
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:29,303
Mousse on a biscuit.

445
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:38,180
Mmm.

446
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:39,748
Hmm.

447
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:49,357
Tastes really good.

448
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:50,692
When can you start?

449
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:03,072
Excuse me,
can you just pull over here?

450
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,045
Hey.

451
00:33:12,212 --> 00:33:13,749
What are you up to?

452
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,952
I think we need a drink,
don't you?

453
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:26,662
Thank you.

454
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,864
Thank you.

455
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:42,177
- I don't do shots anymore.
- Neither do I.

456
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,379
Come on.

457
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:46,480
Let's celebrate
like the old days.

458
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:49,116
3, 2, 1.

459
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,219
Mmm.

460
00:34:00,228 --> 00:34:01,697
Clarissa?

461
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,865
Do you want some supper?

462
00:34:03,897 --> 00:34:07,001
I'm all good.

463
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:36,764
Bake with me.

464
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:39,200
You're right, I'm not Sarah.

465
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:41,103
Your passion for this project,
that's what we need.

466
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:42,471
Put that in the kitchen.

467
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:44,639
- Except I'm not a baker.
- Yes, you are.

468
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:46,407
- We trained together.
- Yeah, years ago.

469
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,909
- So?
- So...

470
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:52,447
I'm not as good as her, alright?

471
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,184
- I never was.
- Rubbish.

472
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:58,586
You were her best friend.

473
00:34:58,619 --> 00:34:59,887
You were practically sisters.

474
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,590
If anyone can put her spirit
into this, it's you.

475
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:04,291
Ugh.

476
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:05,693
Sarah was special, okay?

477
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,795
She... she was talented,
she was the baker,

478
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:10,733
I just run things. I...

479
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,068
You can do it.

480
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,639
I need to pee.

481
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,494
So that's the light bulb.

482
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,496
Mmhmm, thank you.

483
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,598
Black coffee still?

484
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,000
- Of course.
- Okay.

485
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:46,101
Thank you.

486
00:35:47,768 --> 00:35:50,738
There was a time in about 1985

487
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:52,340
and I'd just come back
from Peru,

488
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:54,342
and you and Sarah are desperate
to try the coffee

489
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,677
I brought back.

490
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,179
And you didn't sleep
for two days.

491
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:58,213
Do you remember?

492
00:35:58,246 --> 00:35:59,782
Yeah, I do you remember that.

493
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:04,451
You always wished
you were sisters, didn't you?

494
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:05,487
Mmhmm.

495
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,722
Absolutely inseparable.

496
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:10,792
I was very proud of you.

497
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:14,096
Both of you.

498
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,238
Mimi.

499
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:27,675
I've really missed you.

500
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:42,990
What do you think?

501
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,766
Mimi?

502
00:36:56,403 --> 00:36:59,039
Hmm.

503
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:01,809
Sarah.

504
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:04,980
Love Sarah.

505
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:58,365
Make way!

506
00:37:58,398 --> 00:37:59,833
Golden coffee bean eclairs.

507
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,169
Not bad, bakery boy.

508
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:03,371
Thank you.

509
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:04,539
Um, excuse me.

510
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:06,007
- Who's left this here?
- Not me.

511
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,074
Matthew, please don't leave it...

512
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:08,143
- Mimi.
- In the window.

513
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:09,543
- It wasn't me.
- It looks awful.

514
00:38:09,577 --> 00:38:10,779
- I just wanted...
- Somebody did.

515
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:12,480
- Put that in the kitchen.
- I'm not doing it.

516
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:15,282
So the contactless,
you just can't use that.

517
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:16,917
When they're using cash...

518
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:18,786
I know, but I don't understand
how the machine works.

519
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,921
- You just need to...
- Just write it all down.

520
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:21,389
- Write it all down.
- Write it all down.

521
00:38:21,422 --> 00:38:23,692
Oh.

522
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,461
- Whoa!
- Sorry, Matthew!

523
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:27,495
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

524
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,135
Uh, do we need these?

525
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:37,472
Probably.

526
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:38,840
You see this goes there.

527
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:41,409
Oh, I like them actually.

528
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:44,112
So I'm having these.

529
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:04,399
Here we go.

530
00:39:24,184 --> 00:39:25,286
Wow, crowds!

531
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:29,024
They'll come.

532
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,929
They'll come.

533
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:38,166
Oh dear.

534
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:57,719
Hi, welcome to Love Sarah's.

535
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:59,621
Hi!

536
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:01,623
- Have you just opened?
- Mmhmm.

537
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:03,424
Yeah, it's our first day.

538
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:06,628
50% off of everything.

539
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:08,896
- Hello.
- Nice!

540
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,600
What would you like now?

541
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,702
Pastéis de nata.

542
00:40:15,735 --> 00:40:17,271
What's he saying?

543
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:19,873
Oh, he's just wants a cake
that we have back home.

544
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:22,710
- Where is it?
- Lisbon.

545
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:25,145
Hmm, I'll tell you what.

546
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:28,215
Hmm, would you have
one of these maybe?

547
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,021
Purple?

548
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:35,690
Yeah, perfect.

549
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:38,158
Would you like a coffee?

550
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,629
Oh yes, please, a latté.

551
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:45,400
I'll get you a plate.

552
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:52,841
Two people and it's lunchtime.

553
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:55,409
Relax, it's our first day.

554
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:57,312
No one knows about us yet.

555
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,879
Exactly.

556
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:01,949
Oh, hello, yes.

557
00:41:01,983 --> 00:41:04,552
I was wondering if I could speak
to your food editor, please?

558
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:07,989
Hi, could I speak to a...
uh, Naomi Parker, please?

559
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:10,657
Yes, it's Isabella.
I'm calling from Love Sarah.

560
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,359
Oh, she's left, okay.

561
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:13,494
We're a new bakery,
Golborne Road.

562
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:15,362
Do you know where she's gone?

563
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:20,335
Hello?

564
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:23,403
Hello?

565
00:41:23,436 --> 00:41:25,572
Again.

566
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,709
No, I'll just write it down.

567
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:31,546
- Oh!
- Good morning.

568
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,048
It's our friendly
neighbourhood watch.

569
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:36,617
I see you spying.

570
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,721
Here.

571
00:41:39,753 --> 00:41:41,054
It's our soft opening.

572
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:42,457
On the house.

573
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:47,427
There are four other bakers
within five minutes' walk.

574
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,963
What makes you so special?

575
00:41:49,996 --> 00:41:52,134
Why don't you try one
and tell me?

576
00:41:58,905 --> 00:42:00,974
I'm Mimi, by the way.

577
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:03,744
Felix Rosenbaum.

578
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,483
You the proprietor?

579
00:42:08,516 --> 00:42:09,784
- We all are.
- Mmhmm.

580
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:11,853
Well, you wanna be careful
around here.

581
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:14,489
You know, intruders, burglars.

582
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:15,623
As fate would have it,

583
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:18,125
I've just finalized
my latest invention,

584
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,163
the most advanced
infrared security system

585
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:24,565
of the 21st century.

586
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,235
How fascinating.

587
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:33,208
So good luck.

588
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,277
Thanks for dropping by.

589
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:46,487
Simon.

590
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:50,458
To what do I owe this pleasure?

591
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,759
I'm just popping out.

592
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:55,063
Hey, we're still open.

593
00:42:55,096 --> 00:42:56,597
We're dead anyway.
Give him a break.

594
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,532
Yeah, Isabella, give me a break.

595
00:42:58,565 --> 00:43:00,400
Can you, um...

596
00:43:00,434 --> 00:43:01,769
Thanks.

597
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,942
He's only messing.

598
00:43:07,974 --> 00:43:09,409
- Yeah, right.
- Come on.

599
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:10,812
It's fine, he's hilarious.

600
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:11,878
Jesus.

601
00:43:11,911 --> 00:43:13,914
- What, are you jealous?
- Oh, please.

602
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:15,182
Alright, well,
you don't need to be.

603
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:17,585
You know, 'cause it's not
like I'm gonna sleep

604
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:19,721
with my dad anyway.

605
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,923
What?

606
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:25,460
Matthew is not your father,
okay?

607
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:26,561
He's not.

608
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:28,829
Okay, well,
then who else would it be?

609
00:43:28,862 --> 00:43:30,397
That I can't tell you.

610
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,432
Why?

611
00:43:31,465 --> 00:43:34,736
Because she always said

612
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:35,936
she never knew his name.

613
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:37,704
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.

614
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:40,073
Clarissa,
he's not, okay? He can't be.

615
00:43:40,106 --> 00:43:41,742
I'm sorry, were you there
at the conception?

616
00:43:41,775 --> 00:43:43,478
Sarah never lied, did she?

617
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,346
To anybody.
Certainly not to me!

618
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:49,317
I mean, if... ugh, if he was
then... then I would know.

619
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:52,186
Well, then why is he here?

620
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:55,756
I don't know.

621
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:04,032
I am flattered.

622
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:05,300
I am, honestly.

623
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:08,636
Okay.

624
00:44:08,668 --> 00:44:10,304
Y... look, I can't.

625
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:11,339
Not yet.

626
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:13,674
I'm... just...

627
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:17,177
Give me a couple more weeks.

628
00:44:18,478 --> 00:44:20,014
Alright, thanks.

629
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,252
Yeah, bye.

630
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,547
Morning.

631
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:53,614
You're late.

632
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:54,915
Relax, it's the weekend.

633
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:56,351
We've got work to do.

634
00:44:56,384 --> 00:44:57,818
Have you got me a bonnet
as well?

635
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:59,119
You're hilarious.

636
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:02,422
Where's Clarissa?

637
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:04,592
Why?

638
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,360
No reason, I'm just wondering
where Clarissa is.

639
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,701
This one is you.

640
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:15,436
- Thank you, cheers.
- It's okay.

641
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:17,105
- Hello.
- Hey, Matthew!

642
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,111
Mmm.

643
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:27,048
Do you remember
the first time you met mum?

644
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:28,048
Of course, I do.

645
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:30,717
It was our first lesson
in Paris.

646
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,186
What was she like back then?

647
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,123
- Scary.
- Hmm.

648
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:37,991
Intimidating.

649
00:45:38,025 --> 00:45:40,827
Beautiful.

650
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,298
So what actually happened
with you guys?

651
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:47,034
I messed up.

652
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:52,139
I was, you know,
young, irresponsible.

653
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:53,640
Did you love her?

654
00:45:53,673 --> 00:45:55,208
Oh, pomegranates.

655
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:56,377
Did you?

656
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,246
Everyone loves everyone
when they're 19.

657
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,281
Yeah.

658
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:01,750
Oh, raspberries.

659
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:07,221
So why did you come
to our bakery?

660
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:10,290
It's a difficult question.

661
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:19,867
I don't know,
I suppose unfinished business.

662
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,302
Mmhmm.

663
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,539
When I heard
about what happened to your mum.

664
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:30,777
I felt terrible,
like I should have...

665
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:33,414
I should have got in touch.

666
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:36,117
Made amends.

667
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,218
Hmm.

668
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:38,753
Thank you.

669
00:46:42,188 --> 00:46:43,190
Hmm.

670
00:46:43,224 --> 00:46:44,425
Ow!
What was that?

671
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,093
Sor...
it's nothing, you had a...

672
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:48,729
You just...
you had a thing on you.

673
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:50,565
- A thing.
- Ow.

674
00:46:50,597 --> 00:46:51,932
That was weird.

675
00:46:58,005 --> 00:46:59,874
What?

676
00:47:31,672 --> 00:47:32,706
Okay.

677
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:36,243
So £83, 55p.

678
00:47:36,277 --> 00:47:37,311
Which makes...

679
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,884
£658.

680
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:47,522
Oh Lord, is that it?

681
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:49,656
It was only our first week.

682
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,759
But it doesn't
even pay our rent!

683
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:54,161
It takes time, Mimi, doesn't it?

684
00:47:54,193 --> 00:47:57,731
Oh, we should be jammed
in our first week.

685
00:47:57,764 --> 00:47:59,666
People are always excited
about a new place opening,

686
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:01,034
but we're empty.

687
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:03,871
It was just our
first week, everything's fine.

688
00:48:03,903 --> 00:48:06,173
Everything is not fine,
Clarissa.

689
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:10,177
Mimi Curachi?

690
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,445
Yes, that's me.

691
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:13,213
Enjoy.

692
00:48:13,246 --> 00:48:15,081
Hmm.

693
00:48:15,114 --> 00:48:16,550
Thank you.

694
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:19,419
Who's buying you flowers?

695
00:48:19,452 --> 00:48:20,954
Mind your own business.

696
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:27,862
Hello. I brought you
a little something.

697
00:48:27,894 --> 00:48:30,664
We had rather too many leftovers

698
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:32,365
and it seems a shame
to waste them.

699
00:48:32,398 --> 00:48:33,400
- So...
- Well, alright.

700
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:34,735
- Would you like?
- Lovely, yes.

701
00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:36,304
Yes, well, please, come in.

702
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:38,139
Come in.

703
00:48:39,873 --> 00:48:41,009
Yeah.

704
00:48:44,911 --> 00:48:45,946
Uh, oh.

705
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,514
- Um, where would you like them?
- Oh yes.

706
00:48:47,547 --> 00:48:48,648
Um, right.

707
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:51,652
Uh, right, yeah.

708
00:48:54,188 --> 00:48:55,856
That's... that's... yeah.

709
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:57,458
Here, g... give me your coat.

710
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,992
Oh, thank you.

711
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:00,193
Thank you.

712
00:49:00,226 --> 00:49:01,394
What a nice apartment!

713
00:49:01,427 --> 00:49:03,563
- No, it's a flat.
- Oh.

714
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:05,365
Not Americans.

715
00:49:05,398 --> 00:49:06,733
- It's a flat.
- Hmm.

716
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:08,501
- Within a house.
- Oh.

717
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:11,438
Of course, it uh,
used to be a whole house

718
00:49:11,472 --> 00:49:12,473
once upon a time,

719
00:49:12,505 --> 00:49:14,307
but that's what we do
these days.

720
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,577
We chop, chop, chop, chop.

721
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,313
We'll be living in a cupboard
in 30 years.

722
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:23,150
We won't be around in 30 years.

723
00:49:23,182 --> 00:49:24,184
Lucky us.

724
00:49:24,217 --> 00:49:25,353
Hmm.

725
00:49:34,128 --> 00:49:36,864
Thank you very much
for the flowers, by the way.

726
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:39,900
Oh, uh, thank you for the uh...

727
00:49:39,932 --> 00:49:41,534
- Eclairs.
- Confectionery.

728
00:49:41,568 --> 00:49:43,270
Yeah, thank you.

729
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:44,638
Thank you.

730
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:52,313
So you really are an inventor.

731
00:49:52,346 --> 00:49:54,315
Well, I keep trying.

732
00:49:54,347 --> 00:49:56,182
- Voilà!
- Oh!

733
00:49:57,985 --> 00:50:01,021
Yeah, when you're inventing,
you're looking for something

734
00:50:01,054 --> 00:50:03,556
that people don't know
that they want.

735
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,760
Oh my goodness!

736
00:50:11,597 --> 00:50:13,933
This was Sarah's favourite book.

737
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,637
I used to read it to her
when we were on tour.

738
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,938
- Phileas Fogg.
- Hmm.

739
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,239
Yes.

740
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:21,475
Inveterate rival of mine, yes.

741
00:50:21,507 --> 00:50:24,978
Great inventor,
intrepid traveller.

742
00:50:25,012 --> 00:50:27,548
Mind you, these days
we don't need to travel

743
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:29,550
to discover the world.

744
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:33,153
The world has come to us.

745
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:42,663
Oh, sorry.

746
00:50:42,695 --> 00:50:44,398
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

747
00:50:54,942 --> 00:50:57,077
Hello, I have
a delivery here for Mimi.

748
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,179
Thank you.

749
00:50:58,211 --> 00:50:59,980
Can you sign here, please?

750
00:51:00,847 --> 00:51:02,182
Thank you.

751
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:04,050
Uh, ooh, actually um,

752
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:07,721
why don't you try a slice
of this?

753
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:09,323
W... what... what is it?

754
00:51:09,356 --> 00:51:12,526
This is a strawberry fraisier.

755
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:13,961
Frais-fraisier?

756
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:16,664
Yeah, it's like this
creamy strawberry...

757
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:18,132
Jelly mix.

758
00:51:18,164 --> 00:51:21,134
Yeah, sort of thing,
if you're into that.

759
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:23,503
Oh, okay.

760
00:51:23,536 --> 00:51:25,405
Can't have this.

761
00:51:25,438 --> 00:51:26,873
Th... thank... thank you.

762
00:51:26,907 --> 00:51:28,375
Yeah.

763
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:29,476
Um.

764
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,178
Um, hello,
excuse me.

765
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,012
Just a second.

766
00:51:33,045 --> 00:51:35,582
Um, take that out for a minute.

767
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:37,083
Where are you from?

768
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:38,119
Express Bikes, why?

769
00:51:38,152 --> 00:51:39,186
No, no, don't tell the...

770
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:40,521
What country?

771
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:41,555
Oh, Latvia.

772
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:42,690
- Latvia?
- Hmm.

773
00:51:42,722 --> 00:51:45,291
And what do you have at home
for a treat?

774
00:51:45,324 --> 00:51:47,027
I... I... I do not understand.

775
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:49,096
If you went to
a bakery, what would you buy?

776
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:50,931
- All sorts.
- No, that's what I mean.

777
00:51:50,963 --> 00:51:53,299
What exactly would you buy?

778
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,367
Don't yell at me, lady.

779
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,402
No, I'm just asking you

780
00:51:55,434 --> 00:51:56,670
what was your favourite.

781
00:51:56,702 --> 00:52:00,474
I don't know,
I suppose kringle.

782
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:01,842
What's that?

783
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:06,012
It's... it's like
this sweet bread thing.

784
00:52:06,045 --> 00:52:07,480
Oh, it's so good.

785
00:52:07,514 --> 00:52:10,885
And can you get them in London?

786
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:12,486
I don't know,
I... I don't think so.

787
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:14,053
But would you if you could?

788
00:52:14,086 --> 00:52:15,322
Of course.

789
00:52:15,355 --> 00:52:16,356
Good.

790
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:17,692
Okay, you can go now.

791
00:52:25,865 --> 00:52:28,201
- Where's Matthew?
- He's in the kitchen.

792
00:52:28,235 --> 00:52:29,403
Matthew!

793
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:31,105
Look, let's look around us.

794
00:52:31,137 --> 00:52:34,240
London is the most
multicultural city on Earth.

795
00:52:34,273 --> 00:52:35,208
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

796
00:52:35,242 --> 00:52:36,310
It's like a sort of

797
00:52:36,342 --> 00:52:37,677
cosmopolitan collective,

798
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,914
but nobody's actually
from here, are they?

799
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:42,916
I mean, if I think about it, uh,
Boris,

800
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:46,920
my butcher is Hungarian,
my yoga teacher is Russian,

801
00:52:46,954 --> 00:52:48,756
and Nicoletta,
who runs the flower shop,

802
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:50,024
she's from Italy.

803
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:53,893
What do you think these people
would really like?

804
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:56,329
Something to remind them
of home.

805
00:52:56,362 --> 00:52:57,498
Right.

806
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,532
Like that young boy

807
00:52:58,565 --> 00:52:59,700
who came in minute ago.

808
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:02,135
He doesn't know
strawberry frasier or...

809
00:53:02,168 --> 00:53:04,637
- Fraisier.
- Fraisier, whatever it is.

810
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:05,873
He doesn't know that.

811
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:07,875
He only knows a kringle.

812
00:53:07,907 --> 00:53:10,243
And if he wants a kringle,
then let's make him one.

813
00:53:10,277 --> 00:53:12,579
I mean, he can't be
the only Latvian in London.

814
00:53:12,612 --> 00:53:14,447
This city is home
to so many people

815
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:15,816
from all over the place.

816
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:17,785
If the government stops tryin'
to kick 'em out.

817
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:19,220
So what
are you saying?

818
00:53:19,253 --> 00:53:24,225
We make our bakery
a home away from home.

819
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:26,125
I mean, Sarah loved to travel,
didn't she?

820
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:28,796
Discovering new food,
when she was studying abroad.

821
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:34,201
So why didn't we bake foods
that no one else bakes?

822
00:53:34,233 --> 00:53:39,206
Something for our customers
to remind them of home.

823
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:40,307
What do you think?

824
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:43,811
It'll be fine.

825
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:45,378
I just... we just need

826
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,714
to research it, I think.

827
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:20,179
Okay.

828
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:23,550
- Okay.
- Oh, look.

829
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:24,585
Oh, it looks great.

830
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:43,369
- Isabella.
- Yeah.

831
00:54:43,402 --> 00:54:44,605
In the kitchen.

832
00:54:44,637 --> 00:54:46,306
- What?
- Now.

833
00:54:52,612 --> 00:54:54,514
What was that?

834
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:56,250
So you're gonna join me or what?

835
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:14,100
And then sukker, kanel, smør,
like dash, dash, dash.

836
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:15,135
Thick.

837
00:55:15,168 --> 00:55:16,403
You fold it over

838
00:55:16,436 --> 00:55:18,706
into thin stripe
and then we twin the...

839
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:20,039
Thin stripe?

840
00:55:20,072 --> 00:55:21,607
Like um, twist, you know?

841
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:22,608
Twisty.

842
00:55:23,844 --> 00:55:26,780
This is the roll, right?

843
00:55:26,813 --> 00:55:28,949
Use both hands
and just like that.

844
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:29,882
Harder.

845
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,352
Okay, we use...
just a good hand, right?

846
00:55:31,385 --> 00:55:33,854
And then hand around, twice.

847
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,722
Then you pop it through.

848
00:55:35,755 --> 00:55:38,658
- Kanelsnegl.
- Great.

849
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:40,327
Yeah, it's so easy.

850
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,662
How many do you want?

851
00:55:41,695 --> 00:55:45,332
Um, 30.

852
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:46,366
- That'd be good?
- Perfect.

853
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,367
Wondering if I would...

854
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,302
Ow!

855
00:55:49,335 --> 00:55:50,436
Oh God.

856
00:56:08,054 --> 00:56:10,023
Oh yeah.

857
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:14,394
It's his new invention.

858
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:16,262
Yeah.

859
00:56:16,295 --> 00:56:17,330
Oh, Felix.

860
00:56:17,364 --> 00:56:18,565
Hmm.

861
00:56:18,597 --> 00:56:20,166
- Uh...
- Oh, sorry. I beg your pardon.

862
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:21,434
Yeah, sorry.

863
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:22,469
Yeah.

864
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:01,008
I'm not sure
that needs too much icing.

865
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:01,842
Mmm.

866
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:02,809
- What do you think?
- No.

867
00:57:02,842 --> 00:57:04,877
- What's that called?
- Panforte.

868
00:57:04,911 --> 00:57:06,512
- Panfortes.
- Mmm.

869
00:57:06,545 --> 00:57:07,780
- Panforte.
- Panforte.

870
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:09,182
- Oh, it's so good.
- Can I try this one?

871
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:11,851
Yeah, that's Australian,
it's a lamington.

872
00:57:11,885 --> 00:57:13,253
Loads of Aussies here.

873
00:57:13,286 --> 00:57:14,889
Hmm.

874
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:19,992
I think we need a proper
taste test with some locals.

875
00:57:20,025 --> 00:57:22,096
Yeah, but who?

876
00:57:22,128 --> 00:57:23,897
Actually, I know who.

877
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:30,838
Mimi.

878
00:57:30,871 --> 00:57:32,806
Hello, Olga.

879
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:35,074
You got room for one more?

880
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:36,643
So this one is...

881
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:38,344
Tanzanian.

882
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:39,546
- Tanzanian?
- Yeah.

883
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:41,914
Mmm, delicious.

884
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:43,516
Are there many
Tanzanians in London?

885
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,052
- 17,000.
- Hmm.

886
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:48,387
4,000 Venezuelans,
16,000 Russians,

887
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,389
5,000 Norwegians.

888
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:51,557
And a partridge in a pear tree.

889
00:57:52,759 --> 00:57:54,461
And Hondurans?

890
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:56,896
Oh, Louisa, I'll have to check.

891
00:57:58,097 --> 00:57:59,465
But I will, though.

892
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:00,500
Mimi.

893
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:02,169
Mimi, I love it!

894
00:59:10,869 --> 00:59:12,005
Mimi, what are you doing?

895
00:59:12,038 --> 00:59:13,440
I thought
this was a good idea

896
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:14,807
for our Instagram account.

897
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,543
No, no, no, no,
Instagram is for me.

898
00:59:16,576 --> 00:59:17,610
I was settin' that.

899
00:59:17,643 --> 00:59:19,245
Look, black forest gateau.
Delicious.

900
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:21,715
- That's actually very good.
- Do you like?

901
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:34,827
Hmm.

902
00:59:35,762 --> 00:59:38,599
Mmm!

903
00:59:38,632 --> 00:59:39,633
Can I help you?

904
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:40,901
Mmm.

905
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:43,570
Yes, um, can I have
a large cappuccino

906
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:45,472
and um, <i>pain au chocolat</i> to go,
please.

907
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:46,673
Of course.

908
00:59:46,706 --> 00:59:49,242
£4.75 please.

909
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:51,678
Where are you from?

910
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,679
- Tokyo.
- Ah!

911
00:59:53,713 --> 00:59:58,118
Um, matcha mille crepe cake.

912
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:58,985
Yes!

913
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:00,920
How do you know?

914
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:03,056
- Do you make them?
- We can.

915
01:00:03,088 --> 01:00:05,558
Well,
if you make it I'll buy it.

916
01:00:05,592 --> 01:00:06,693
Deal.

917
01:00:06,726 --> 01:00:10,030
Can you do me one
by tomorrow morning?

918
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:11,999
Why not?

919
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:25,311
The Japanese clearly have
too much time on their hands.

920
01:00:28,748 --> 01:00:31,418
What should we do?

921
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:32,686
I don't know.

922
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:34,086
Start again.

923
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:37,190
I guess.

924
01:00:37,222 --> 01:00:40,126
I've got a better idea.

925
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:42,061
And it's not...
you were just confident.

926
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:43,763
You both were.
You were made for each other.

927
01:00:43,797 --> 01:00:46,565
It's not about confidence,
it's about balls.

928
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,701
You got to grow
a pair of balls.

929
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:49,369
- Sarah had balls?
- Yeah, massive balls!

930
01:00:49,402 --> 01:00:51,570
- Huge!
- You kidding?

931
01:00:51,603 --> 01:00:52,905
That's what you got to do
in life.

932
01:00:52,938 --> 01:00:54,574
- Pretend you've got big balls.
- Right.

933
01:00:54,606 --> 01:00:56,175
I mean, people like me,
we're just pretending.

934
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:59,211
And then we busk through life,
performing,

935
01:00:59,244 --> 01:01:01,748
when really underneath it all,
we're just...

936
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:05,351
We're just like everybody else
you know, frightened,

937
01:01:05,385 --> 01:01:08,155
scared,

938
01:01:08,188 --> 01:01:10,724
insecure.

939
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:14,628
Only we walk the walk.

940
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:16,563
That's what you've got to do.

941
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:18,030
Just walk?

942
01:01:18,063 --> 01:01:19,632
Swagger.

943
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:22,501
Better than everybody else.

944
01:01:22,534 --> 01:01:25,371
Well,
that's easier said than done.

945
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:27,941
Oh, you're a good Baker,
Isabella.

946
01:01:27,974 --> 01:01:31,044
You're talented,
you're creative, you just...

947
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:33,413
You got to get out
of those sensible shoes.

948
01:01:33,445 --> 01:01:36,415
Thanks.

949
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:38,552
Get 'em off.

950
01:01:38,585 --> 01:01:39,586
What?

951
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:41,555
Show me your Louboutins.

952
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:43,223
- I don't have Louboutins.
- Yeah, you do.

953
01:01:43,255 --> 01:01:44,257
Come on, get up.

954
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:45,726
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

955
01:01:45,759 --> 01:01:46,992
Repeat after me.

956
01:01:47,025 --> 01:01:50,230
I'm the best goddamn baker
in the whole world.

957
01:01:50,262 --> 01:01:51,264
- No!
- Better than...

958
01:01:51,297 --> 01:01:52,699
- My God.
- Everybody else.

959
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:54,067
- Stop, Matthew.
- Come on, say it!

960
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:54,933
Okay, fine.

961
01:01:54,967 --> 01:01:56,902
- I'm a good baker, okay?
- A good baker?

962
01:01:56,936 --> 01:02:00,474
Well, you're wearing brogues
right now, like flip-flops!

963
01:02:00,507 --> 01:02:01,608
I asked for Louboutins.

964
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:03,510
I'm the best baker in the world.

965
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:04,878
Louder!

966
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:06,679
I'm the best goddamn baker
in the whole fucking world!

967
01:02:08,148 --> 01:02:10,117
Are you happy?

968
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:11,518
Second best.

969
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:20,527
You know...

970
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:25,132
You're probably never
gonna believe me.

971
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:27,733
And it...

972
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:29,702
It makes... makes me sound
like a bit of an arse,

973
01:02:29,735 --> 01:02:33,272
but when we were uh...

974
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:34,574
When we were in school,

975
01:02:34,606 --> 01:02:37,076
in Paris...

976
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,512
And I got together with Sarah.

977
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:41,213
Mmhmm.

978
01:02:41,246 --> 01:02:43,182
That night I came over...

979
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:50,090
It wasn't her
that I was looking for.

980
01:02:55,527 --> 01:02:57,430
You're right, you're an arse.

981
01:03:11,643 --> 01:03:13,379
We have to work in the morning.

982
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:23,090
At 4:00 a.m.

983
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:31,431
Japanese bloody matcha cake.

984
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:16,108
Do you want this?

985
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:17,743
Oh, thank you.

986
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,182
You shouldn't really be smoking.

987
01:04:23,215 --> 01:04:24,451
Oh yeah?
Why is that?

988
01:04:24,483 --> 01:04:26,619
Because you're a dancer.

989
01:04:26,652 --> 01:04:28,053
Not really anymore.

990
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:33,893
When are you gonna go back
to class?

991
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:35,095
Um.

992
01:04:35,996 --> 01:04:38,597
I don't know,
I wasn't planning on it.

993
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,733
Don't leave it too late.

994
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:41,768
Mmhmm.

995
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,070
Don't waste your talent,
Clarissa.

996
01:04:45,103 --> 01:04:48,073
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

997
01:04:48,106 --> 01:04:49,608
Well, it's just hard right now,
isn't it?

998
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:51,110
- Why?
- 'Cause we've got the bakery.

999
01:04:51,143 --> 01:04:54,013
The bakery?
But it's all set up now.

1000
01:04:55,181 --> 01:04:59,086
You did that for your mum
and it's great.

1001
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:05,025
I just really miss her.

1002
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,261
I know.

1003
01:05:08,293 --> 01:05:10,029
So do I.

1004
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:15,335
I wish you would tell me
what happened with you guys.

1005
01:05:19,938 --> 01:05:21,774
Alright.

1006
01:05:23,275 --> 01:05:27,413
Your mum came to me to ask me
to give her some money

1007
01:05:27,447 --> 01:05:31,184
to set up the bakery
with Isabella

1008
01:05:31,217 --> 01:05:33,653
and I turned her down.

1009
01:05:35,355 --> 01:05:38,557
And she accused me
of never being there for her.

1010
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:41,193
Actually, she was right.

1011
01:05:41,226 --> 01:05:43,195
- Hmm.
- I wasn't.

1012
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:48,000
We'd stopped talking
to each other.

1013
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:53,340
That was the saddest thing.

1014
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:05,619
Don't let us ever be like that.

1015
01:06:05,652 --> 01:06:06,720
- Yeah, no...
- Promise?

1016
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:08,722
Yeah, promise.

1017
01:06:19,164 --> 01:06:21,500
You still hate me?

1018
01:06:21,534 --> 01:06:22,535
Yes, I do.

1019
01:06:32,844 --> 01:06:34,413
Oh shit.

1020
01:06:34,447 --> 01:06:36,483
We should get up.

1021
01:06:36,516 --> 01:06:38,885
Yeah.

1022
01:06:38,918 --> 01:06:39,919
We should.

1023
01:07:48,286 --> 01:07:49,922
Isabella!

1024
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:56,496
Isabella!

1025
01:07:56,528 --> 01:07:57,731
The key's in that...

1026
01:07:57,764 --> 01:07:59,865
What's going on?
Let me in.

1027
01:08:01,934 --> 01:08:03,103
I'm so sorry.

1028
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:06,806
I... aren't you supposed to be
at Gastrell's?

1029
01:08:07,606 --> 01:08:08,775
Look, I can explain.

1030
01:08:08,807 --> 01:08:09,976
I can't hear you.

1031
01:08:10,009 --> 01:08:10,777
Come on, open up.

1032
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:13,712
Oh, bake with me, Isabella!

1033
01:08:13,746 --> 01:08:15,682
Be our passion.

1034
01:08:15,715 --> 01:08:17,417
Why? So you can just go off
somewhere better?

1035
01:08:17,449 --> 01:08:18,952
- No, it's not like that.
- Isn't it?

1036
01:08:18,984 --> 01:08:21,253
No, I wanted you to bake with
me, because you're a good baker.

1037
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:23,690
Right, well, this good baker's
got work to do, okay?

1038
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:26,426
- Isabella.
- Just...

1039
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:27,728
Fuck off!

1040
01:08:54,554 --> 01:08:55,989
Is that... look, we got sesame.

1041
01:08:56,021 --> 01:08:57,023
Yes, it does.

1042
01:08:58,123 --> 01:08:59,425
Oh.

1043
01:08:59,457 --> 01:09:01,193
Oh!

1044
01:09:01,226 --> 01:09:03,262
Matcha mille crepe cake.

1045
01:09:03,296 --> 01:09:04,430
Well done!

1046
01:09:04,462 --> 01:09:06,800
- That is perfect.
- Thank you.

1047
01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:30,289
Can we talk?

1048
01:09:36,295 --> 01:09:39,798
They sent me the contract
to try and entice me.

1049
01:09:39,832 --> 01:09:41,835
So you have thought about it?

1050
01:09:41,868 --> 01:09:42,669
Briefly.

1051
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:43,869
- Do you want to go?
- No.

1052
01:09:43,903 --> 01:09:45,405
I thought you
were looking for a challenge.

1053
01:09:45,438 --> 01:09:46,972
- I am!
- Bollocks!

1054
01:09:47,006 --> 01:09:49,676
Matthew, you're here because you
think Clarissa's your daughter.

1055
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:52,778
- No.
- Oh, come on!

1056
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:55,280
Alright, I mean,
maybe in the beginning...

1057
01:09:56,481 --> 01:09:57,818
For a bit, but...

1058
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:03,722
Things have changed.

1059
01:10:04,789 --> 01:10:06,592
You know what?
Just... just go, alright?

1060
01:10:06,626 --> 01:10:08,461
And don't come back.

1061
01:10:08,493 --> 01:10:09,828
Is this
because we slept together?

1062
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:11,197
Because Sarah
wouldn't have liked...

1063
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:13,599
No.
N...

1064
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:15,400
No, it's because
from the minute you got here,

1065
01:10:15,434 --> 01:10:16,869
I said...

1066
01:10:16,903 --> 01:10:20,340
I said you were bad news
and look how it's turned out.

1067
01:10:20,372 --> 01:10:22,407
You need me here.

1068
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:30,182
You said it yourself...
I can bake all by myself.

1069
01:10:38,623 --> 01:10:40,726
Is everythin' okay?

1070
01:10:42,228 --> 01:10:43,596
I'll see you around.

1071
01:10:53,139 --> 01:10:54,207
Oh.

1072
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,240
Oh yeah.

1073
01:10:59,177 --> 01:11:00,246
Oh, my knees.

1074
01:11:01,613 --> 01:11:03,949
Aha.

1075
01:11:03,983 --> 01:11:05,318
Eureka.

1076
01:11:08,154 --> 01:11:10,123
Thank you.

1077
01:11:16,395 --> 01:11:18,831
Can you please stop
being so stubborn?

1078
01:11:18,863 --> 01:11:20,832
Just let Matthew come back,
he's part of our team.

1079
01:11:20,865 --> 01:11:22,234
If you've got
nothing useful to say,

1080
01:11:22,268 --> 01:11:23,269
then get out
of my kitchen.

1081
01:11:23,301 --> 01:11:24,369
Mimi, she's distracting me!

1082
01:11:24,403 --> 01:11:26,005
Well, I agree with Clarissa.

1083
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:28,473
Anyway, 35 top-thin knödel.

1084
01:11:28,506 --> 01:11:30,475
- Good luck.
- Oh.

1085
01:11:30,509 --> 01:11:31,877
I was speaking
with Matthew last night...

1086
01:11:31,911 --> 01:11:33,846
And he misses us.

1087
01:11:33,878 --> 01:11:35,480
Honestly, he just...
he misses you.

1088
01:11:35,514 --> 01:11:37,884
Yeah, I'm not interested.

1089
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:39,485
Really?

1090
01:11:39,518 --> 01:11:40,819
No.

1091
01:11:40,853 --> 01:11:42,387
CLARISSA
Okay, then.

1092
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:43,623
- Come with me!
- What?

1093
01:11:43,655 --> 01:11:44,990
- Here we go, this way.
- Wait, this...

1094
01:11:45,024 --> 01:11:46,759
This way.

1095
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:47,794
Excuse me.

1096
01:11:47,827 --> 01:11:48,927
Hi, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

1097
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:50,630
- Hi.
- Uh, are you single?

1098
01:11:50,662 --> 01:11:51,863
- Larie.
- Uh, yeah.

1099
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:52,731
Great.

1100
01:11:52,765 --> 01:11:53,932
No, he was checking you out
earlier.

1101
01:11:53,966 --> 01:11:55,601
Do you wanna go
on a date with her tonight?

1102
01:11:55,634 --> 01:11:57,869
She baked you that croissant
that you're eating.

1103
01:11:57,903 --> 01:12:00,405
So imagine her baking
that for you every morning

1104
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:03,543
with bacon, and eggs, and sex.

1105
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:05,545
- Uh, if she wants to uh...
- She does.

1106
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:07,280
You should come
pick her up tonight at 7:15.

1107
01:12:09,015 --> 01:12:11,651
- Uh, sure, yeah.
- Okay, great.

1108
01:12:11,684 --> 01:12:13,219
- I got to talk to you.
- No, you don't.

1109
01:12:13,252 --> 01:12:14,153
Clarissa, I've got...

1110
01:12:14,186 --> 01:12:15,488
Sorry, she has a funny way
of doing things.

1111
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,521
- Hi.
- It's nice to meet you,

1112
01:12:16,555 --> 01:12:17,856
- I'm Isabella.
- I'm Pascal.

1113
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:18,891
- Oh, Pascal.
- Nice to meet you.

1114
01:12:18,923 --> 01:12:20,059
- You're French.
- Yes, yes.

1115
01:12:20,091 --> 01:12:21,493
I have to get back.
You liked the croissant?

1116
01:12:21,527 --> 01:12:22,996
Yeah, it's amazing croissant.

1117
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:24,163
That's good.

1118
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:26,131
Um.

1119
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:41,913
So do you often
get set up like this?

1120
01:12:41,947 --> 01:12:43,149
Never.

1121
01:12:43,181 --> 01:12:44,550
Really?

1122
01:12:44,582 --> 01:12:46,418
That girl should set up
a dating agency.

1123
01:12:46,452 --> 01:12:47,587
- She'd make a fortune.
- Oh yeah.

1124
01:12:49,488 --> 01:12:51,057
Cheers.

1125
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,257
Cheers.

1126
01:12:53,591 --> 01:12:54,860
Hmm.

1127
01:12:58,029 --> 01:12:58,831
What?

1128
01:12:58,863 --> 01:13:01,400
S... somewhere to be?

1129
01:13:01,434 --> 01:13:04,871
No, sorry... well...
Yes.

1130
01:13:04,904 --> 01:13:06,672
Actually, I'm sorry,
it's just we had

1131
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:09,509
this really big tricky order
come in for tomorrow

1132
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:13,413
and now all I can think about
is whipping, and creaming,

1133
01:13:13,445 --> 01:13:15,847
and tossing, and... oh God!

1134
01:13:15,881 --> 01:13:17,884
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

1135
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:19,318
It's alright,
we can do this another time...

1136
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,920
- Mm-mm.
- If you want.

1137
01:13:20,953 --> 01:13:22,288
No, no,
this is good for me.

1138
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,922
I... I need to relax.

1139
01:13:23,956 --> 01:13:26,626
It's gonna be fine, right?

1140
01:13:26,658 --> 01:13:27,692
Well, work is work, you know?

1141
01:13:27,725 --> 01:13:29,728
- Just...
- Right.

1142
01:13:29,761 --> 01:13:31,630
Well, isn't this cozy?

1143
01:13:32,597 --> 01:13:33,733
Sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt.

1144
01:13:33,765 --> 01:13:35,634
I'm Pascal, by the way.

1145
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:37,135
Pascal?

1146
01:13:37,168 --> 01:13:38,470
Hmm.

1147
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:39,838
He's very French, isn't he?

1148
01:13:43,309 --> 01:13:44,777
You tense?

1149
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:46,479
See the way she's sitting?
She does that when she's tense.

1150
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:47,913
You're not making her tense,
are you, Pascal?

1151
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:49,215
- I just...
- Matthew, come on.

1152
01:13:49,247 --> 01:13:50,482
A date shouldn't be tense.

1153
01:13:50,515 --> 01:13:51,716
A date should be exciting.

1154
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,219
Although, it has to be said

1155
01:13:53,252 --> 01:13:54,454
she's a very tense person.

1156
01:13:54,487 --> 01:13:56,056
Matthew, come on.

1157
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:03,695
But she completely gets away
with it, because she's...

1158
01:14:06,064 --> 01:14:08,835
She's great and...

1159
01:14:08,868 --> 01:14:12,305
...you'd be lucky to have her,
Pascal, tense or untense.

1160
01:14:18,377 --> 01:14:20,646
Alright, look,
I've made mistakes.

1161
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:21,913
Okay, fine.

1162
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:23,882
I'm a... I'm a terrible person

1163
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:26,619
and if Clarissa is my daughter,

1164
01:14:26,652 --> 01:14:28,253
then it'll be really difficult.

1165
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:31,958
But I... I just want you to know
that I'm...

1166
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:34,627
I'm in this for the long haul,
I'm not going anywhere.

1167
01:14:35,828 --> 01:14:38,832
Whether you like it or not,
alright?

1168
01:14:47,305 --> 01:14:48,674
Enjoy your date.

1169
01:14:57,349 --> 01:14:58,784
I like mille-feuille the best.

1170
01:14:58,817 --> 01:15:00,953
Would you make a mille-feuille?

1171
01:15:09,996 --> 01:15:12,364
I was gonna send it off. Yeah.

1172
01:15:17,302 --> 01:15:20,773
Find out, but um...

1173
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,443
Well, once I got to know you...

1174
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:29,282
It just didn't seem right.

1175
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,690
So what do you wanna do?

1176
01:15:38,724 --> 01:15:40,627
Do you wanna find out?

1177
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:45,765
Yeah.

1178
01:15:51,237 --> 01:15:52,337
I think so.

1179
01:15:52,371 --> 01:15:54,774
Um, yeah, I've
only done 5p so far, so...

1180
01:15:54,806 --> 01:15:57,143
- You've done what?
- 5p so...

1181
01:15:57,176 --> 01:15:58,144
Come in.

1182
01:15:58,176 --> 01:16:00,078
Oh, hello again.

1183
01:16:00,112 --> 01:16:02,215
Hi.

1184
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:05,050
Um, I know this is huge,

1185
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:08,354
but you could maybe do me two
of those matcha cake

1186
01:16:08,386 --> 01:16:11,023
by tomorrow 9:00 a.m.

1187
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:12,190
Two?

1188
01:16:12,224 --> 01:16:13,859
Oh, we have
these big Tuesday meetings

1189
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:16,229
and it's my turn to cater,

1190
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:19,331
and I was telling all
my colleagues how good you are.

1191
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:21,233
Consider it done.

1192
01:16:21,266 --> 01:16:23,635
You're my lifesaver.

1193
01:16:23,668 --> 01:16:25,770
Oh, you can't just spring that
on me.

1194
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:27,006
You made one last time.

1195
01:16:27,038 --> 01:16:28,440
Yeah, one.

1196
01:16:28,474 --> 01:16:29,742
But now, this is two.

1197
01:16:29,774 --> 01:16:31,376
On top of everything else.

1198
01:16:31,409 --> 01:16:33,613
Well, you're just
gonna have to call Matthew.

1199
01:16:35,514 --> 01:16:36,515
No.

1200
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:37,649
Well, one thing
is for sure,

1201
01:16:37,682 --> 01:16:39,085
you better make them good.

1202
01:16:43,154 --> 01:16:43,956
Time Out.

1203
01:16:43,988 --> 01:16:46,324
- Mmhmm.
- Mmhmm.

1204
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:00,706
Oh!

1205
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:08,014
Oh!

1206
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:44,710
Ooh! Sorry.
Thank you very much.

1207
01:18:45,877 --> 01:18:46,978
Hello.

1208
01:18:47,011 --> 01:18:50,582
Um, I'm here to drop these off
for Yuuna Tanaka.

1209
01:18:50,615 --> 01:18:51,917
I'll tell her they're here.

1210
01:18:51,949 --> 01:18:53,284
Oh, no, no,
don't worry about it.

1211
01:18:53,318 --> 01:18:55,087
I can take them up myself.

1212
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:56,788
They'll be okay here.

1213
01:18:59,557 --> 01:19:01,460
Okay, sure.

1214
01:19:01,493 --> 01:19:03,062
Um, please don't...

1215
01:19:03,095 --> 01:19:03,896
These you go.

1216
01:19:03,929 --> 01:19:06,065
Careful with them.
Thank you.

1217
01:19:13,104 --> 01:19:15,473
I don't know I can't see them.

1218
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:16,808
<i>Why not?</i>

1219
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:19,177
I don't know
which office they're in, Mimi.

1220
01:19:19,211 --> 01:19:20,546
<i>Oh.</i>

1221
01:19:20,578 --> 01:19:21,846
Oh, hang on.

1222
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,516
<i>But what can you
actually see, Clarissa?</i>

1223
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:26,719
Hold on.

1224
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:28,221
<i>What's happening?</i>

1225
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,557
Well, I can see people chatting,
but no cakes.

1226
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:33,592
<i>Oh.</i>

1227
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:35,094
Excuse me.

1228
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:36,128
Can I help you?

1229
01:19:36,161 --> 01:19:37,863
Hello.

1230
01:19:37,895 --> 01:19:39,331
Is this man with you?

1231
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:42,701
Shh!

1232
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:44,303
No, I have no idea.

1233
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:00,853
So, um...

1234
01:20:02,488 --> 01:20:04,123
...you gonna see that guy again?

1235
01:20:12,497 --> 01:20:14,733
I'm gonna keep my options open.

1236
01:20:26,177 --> 01:20:27,246
Matthew.

1237
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:05,684
Well...

1238
01:21:05,716 --> 01:21:07,286
This is me.

1239
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:09,889
Yeah, yeah.

1240
01:21:09,921 --> 01:21:11,589
Thank you for walking me home.

1241
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:13,324
Well, it's good for the legs.

1242
01:21:13,358 --> 01:21:15,127
It stops them from seizing up.

1243
01:21:21,432 --> 01:21:23,068
Good night, Felix.

1244
01:21:24,536 --> 01:21:25,538
Good night, Mimi.

1245
01:21:28,806 --> 01:21:32,010
Actually, would you like
to come in for a coffee?

1246
01:21:34,512 --> 01:21:37,582
So long as it's decaf.

1247
01:21:37,615 --> 01:21:40,418
Otherwise,
I might be up all night.

1248
01:21:40,452 --> 01:21:42,288
Lucky me.

1249
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:23,429
Did you ever watch <i>Jeremy Kyle?</i>

1250
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,798
No.

1251
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:29,668
They did these live DNA tests.

1252
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:31,537
Can you imagine?

1253
01:22:32,837 --> 01:22:34,974
Must be fun for them, I suppose.

1254
01:22:35,006 --> 01:22:38,143
I don't think it's fun
for anyone.

1255
01:22:38,176 --> 01:22:41,313
More fun than STDs.

1256
01:22:41,345 --> 01:22:43,548
That must be the worst, right?

1257
01:22:43,582 --> 01:22:44,583
Weeping vag...

1258
01:22:44,615 --> 01:22:45,818
Oh my God.

1259
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:47,052
Sorry.

1260
01:22:48,787 --> 01:22:50,222
I'm a bit nervous.

1261
01:22:56,094 --> 01:22:58,262
Listen.

1262
01:23:00,364 --> 01:23:01,766
If I'm not your father...

1263
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,636
- Whoa.
- No, no.

1264
01:23:03,668 --> 01:23:07,405
- If I'm not...
- No, Matthew, please.

1265
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:10,743
I can still be there for you.

1266
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:13,645
You really don't have
to say that.

1267
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,280
I want to.

1268
01:23:16,314 --> 01:23:19,118
Um, be there.

1269
01:23:26,725 --> 01:23:28,727
I'm scared of the dark,
I'm terrible with money,

1270
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,462
and I smoke far too much weed.

1271
01:23:30,494 --> 01:23:32,131
Why would you want me?

1272
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,072
Matthew, Clarissa,

1273
01:23:41,105 --> 01:23:43,341
so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

1274
01:23:44,975 --> 01:23:47,880
I'm afraid the results
aren't quite

1275
01:23:47,912 --> 01:23:50,348
what I think you might be
hoping for.

1276
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:55,320
The test results are negative.

1277
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,194
We do have
a counsellor available

1278
01:24:03,228 --> 01:24:07,099
if that might be of help.

1279
01:24:14,439 --> 01:24:17,043
Do people get excited
when you tell them it's a "yes"?

1280
01:24:34,626 --> 01:24:36,328
Hello, Mimi Curachi speaking.

1281
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,729
<i>Hi, Mrs. Curachi.</i>

1282
01:24:37,762 --> 01:24:38,997
Um...
What?

1283
01:24:39,029 --> 01:24:40,032
<i>This is, uh,</i>

1284
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,466

1285
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,002
<i>Do you have a moment to speak?</i>

1286
01:24:44,034 --> 01:24:45,069
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1287
01:24:45,103 --> 01:24:47,072
<i>Tuff Turf,</i> Robert Downey, Jr.

1288
01:24:47,104 --> 01:24:49,073
- Oh my God.
- They're gonna run a feature!

1289
01:24:49,106 --> 01:24:50,408
- Who?
- Time Out!

1290
01:24:50,442 --> 01:24:51,743
- What?
- They're gonna run a feature

1291

- on us!
- Oh my God!

1292

Oh my God, that's amazing.

1293
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:56,547
Matthew,
have you got any brandy?

1294
01:24:56,581 --> 01:24:57,548
- Yes.
- Quick.

1295
01:24:57,582 --> 01:24:59,017
Oh my God.

1296
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:01,587
- After all this!
- Adored them!

1297
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:03,889
- Well, that's all...
- Well done, you.

1298
01:25:03,921 --> 01:25:05,590
That's amazing.

1299
01:25:05,623 --> 01:25:06,591
Whoa.

1300
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,693
So you're happy with that?

1301
01:25:14,632 --> 01:25:16,033
Why don't you put yours
the other side.

1302
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:18,403
And um...

1303
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:20,204
- Actually, um...
- Yes.

1304
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:21,273
Clarissa, can we...

1305
01:25:24,141 --> 01:25:26,144
Okay, how we looking?

1306
01:25:27,746 --> 01:25:28,814
You're gonna sit.

1307
01:25:28,846 --> 01:25:31,082
Here, there, now sit here.

1308
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:32,583
- Okay, get them together.
- Are you ready?

1309
01:25:33,952 --> 01:25:35,654
Okay, come on.

1310
01:25:35,686 --> 01:25:37,890

- Yeah.

01:25:37,922 --> 01:25:39,358
Good.

1312
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,359
You've gotta be
in the front row.

1313
01:25:41,393 --> 01:25:42,627
- Sorry.
- Come on together, please.

1314
01:25:42,661 --> 01:25:44,829
Yeah, that's good.

1315
01:25:44,863 --> 01:25:46,365
- Okay.
- Ready.

1316
01:25:46,398 --> 01:25:47,900
- Smile.
- Okay.

1317
01:25:47,932 --> 01:25:49,100
- Okay, great.
- Here we are.

1318
01:25:49,134 --> 01:25:50,301
- Front page.
- Well done.

1319
01:25:50,335 --> 01:25:51,336
Well done, we've done it.

1320
01:25:51,368 --> 01:25:52,703
- Thank you.
- Smile.

1321
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:56,876
Hmm.

1322
01:26:02,747 --> 01:26:04,082
One more time.

1323
01:26:04,114 --> 01:26:06,284
Sarah would love this,
wouldn't she?

1324
01:26:06,318 --> 01:26:07,418
She really would.

1325
01:26:07,452 --> 01:26:08,520
- She would.
- I know she would.

1326
01:26:08,552 --> 01:26:10,255
- Smiling.
- Thank you.

1327
01:26:10,287 --> 01:26:12,657
Last one.

1328
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:43,240
"My dearest Sarah,

1329
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:46,278
I'm sorry we haven't spoken
for so long.

1330
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:50,982
I've been dreadfully stubborn
and for that I'm not proud.

1331
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:55,720
Of course, I'll support you
in whatever you need.

1332
01:28:55,753 --> 01:28:56,954
Perhaps,
we could meet up soon

1333
01:28:56,988 --> 01:28:59,157
and discuss
your brilliant bakery.

1334
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:00,891
I'd like that.

1335
01:29:00,925 --> 01:29:03,462
It's time we spoke again.

1336
01:29:03,494 --> 01:29:05,997
All my love, Mum."

1337
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:52,938
Is anyone else hungry?

1338
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:54,906
Starving.

1339
01:31:44,855 --> 01:31:46,690
- Oh my God!
- Mimi.

1340
01:31:46,724 --> 01:31:47,926
Oh, um.

1341
01:31:52,963 --> 01:31:54,166
You want them, you want them?

1342
01:31:54,198 --> 01:31:55,266
Hi...

1343
01:32:00,337 --> 01:32:01,438
Hi, sorry, two more ticks.

1344
01:32:01,471 --> 01:32:03,641
Just... sorry, sorry,
two more seconds.

1345
01:32:03,675 --> 01:32:05,177
- Need a hand?
- Yes.

1346
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:06,877
Um, can I please have...

1347
01:32:06,911 --> 01:32:08,246
One cappuccino
and two flat whites?

1348
01:32:08,279 --> 01:32:09,548
One cappuccino
and two flat whites.

1349
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:11,349
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry.

1350
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:12,583
Yes, madam, what can I get you?

1351
01:33:59,355 --> 01:34:04,355
