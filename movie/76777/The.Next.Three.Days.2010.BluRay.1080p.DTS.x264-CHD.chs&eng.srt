1
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,662
请送我去医院！
Please, get me to a hospital!

2
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,624
我不能呼吸
I can't breathe.

3
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,356
你知道吗？如果够聪明的话 现在最好不要说话
You know what? If you were smart, you would stop talking right now.

4
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,902
告我啊 我只知道 妇女不该为妇女工作
Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women.

5
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,069
你怎么能这么说？
How can you say that?

6
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,322
因为他们会感到威胁
Because they're always threatened.

7
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,574
特别是如果你比他们美丽
Especially if you're beautiful, and they're not.

8
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,326
很好！你从未与你的上司吵过架？
Fine! You never had a fight with your boss?

9
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,577
从来没有 你知道为什么吗？
Never. You know why?

10
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,205
因为他是一个男人
Because he's a man.

11
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,873
我们能不能换话题呢？
Can we please drop this?

12
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,876
我只是想回家 吻我的儿子 老公
I just want to go home and kiss my son. Honey.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,046
你看 你非要提到你有一个孩子 而我们没有
See, you have to mention that you have a child and we don't.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,882
- 那就是我的看法 - 艾瑞特 我没有那个意思
- There's my point. - Erit, I didn't say anything of the sort.

15
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,384
不要道歉 这是基因使然
Don't apologize, it's genetics.

16
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,512
女人总是互相竞争
Women are always competing with each other.

17
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,388
这就是为什么你和你的老板处不来
That's why you're having problems with your boss.

18
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,682
- 因为她是个女人 - 完全正确
- Because she's a woman. - Exactly.

19
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,894
妇女应为男人工作 男人为女人 就是这样
Women should work under men, men under women. That's it.

20
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,312
那男人为男人工作勒？
What about men under men?

21
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,523
这也很好   我的意思是 他们较能相处
That's fine, too. I mean, they can deal with it.

22
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,400
- 我们可以走了吗？ - 谁想再喝一杯吗？
- Can we go now? - Either of you guys want another drink?

23
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,568
- 我们还好 - 一杯？两杯？
- We're good. - Shot? Double?

24
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,530
妇女能成就令人惊叹的事情 像我就是
Women can do amazing things. I am one. I know.

25
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,114
但是 即使我都不愿当我的部下
But even I would never work for me.

26
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,033
这点我们有共识了 晚安 米克
That we can agree on. Good night, Mick.

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,785
我们处得很僵
We are in a bad mood.

28
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,558
她的话有道理 兄弟 你知道的
She's got a point, bro, you know.

29
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,247
我宁愿当你的下属而不是他的
I'd much rather work under you than her.

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,376
这很好 我也愿意在他手下工作
That's nice. I'd rather work under him, too.

31
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,379
你宁愿在约翰“底下”工作？
You'd rather "work" under John?

32
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,798
你连这个都不爽喔？
You have a problem with that, too?

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,634
不！为什么我会对你的小小性暗示不爽？
No! Why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?

34
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,885
你今晚有啥毛病啊？
What is up your ass tonight?

35
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,973
那么 我应该呆坐在这里 看你就在我面前挑逗我的丈夫？
So I should just sit here while you come on to my husband right in front of me?

36
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,893
拉娜 如果我想要你的丈夫 我会拥有他 就像这样
Lara, if I wanted your husband, I would have him, like that.

37
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,187
像怎样？你还能给露更多的奶给他看？
How? You couldn't possibly show him more of those tits.

38
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,939
- 你知道你的问题是什么吗？ - 好啦
- You know what your problem is? - Okay...

39
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,275
我的问题是你的大脑跟这只鸡的一样大
My problem is your brain is as big as those tits.

40
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,734
- 宝贝 是你的错！ - 是 我的错！
- Baby, this is your fault! - Huge, exactly!

41
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,819
这是你的…
This is your...

42
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,988
如果你有它一半的大脑 我们就不会讨论这个问题
If you had half a brain, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

43
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,865
宝贝 随它去吧 随它去吧
Baby. Let it go, let it go, let it go.

44
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,701
- 晚安 亲爱的兄弟！ - 晚安！
- Good night, brother dear! - Good night!

45
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,537
- 她真的是目空一切 - 现在你信我了吧！
- She's completely full of herself. - Don't try and agree with me now!

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,372
我甚至怀疑她真的是一个专业牙医吗
I don't even think she's a member of the dental profession.

47
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,748
停止
Shut up!

48
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,710
她可能连“麻醉师”都不会拼
She probably can't even spell "anesthesiologist."

49
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,046
- 那个女人根本是个冒牌货 - 我们去过她的办公室聚会 你这白痴！
- The woman's a complete fraud. - We went to her office party, you idiot!

50
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,382
我相信 她那天晚上一定有偷打我
And I believe she hit on me that night as well.

51
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,800
你胡思乱想
You are completely delusional.

52
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:40,244
刚刚在里面她也没打你啊 我只是不喜欢她
She didn't even hit on you in there. I just don't like her.

53
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,514
我知道你的意思了 真的 我同意你
I understand your point of view. I really do. I agree with you.

54
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,310
像她那付德性根本不配帮人口腔手术
Somebody who looks like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.

55
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,312
你是个混蛋！
You are an asshole!

56
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,940
坐下来 保持冷静
You're sitting in the chair, you're trying to stay calm,

57
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,152
别再跟他们计较了…
and you got them things hanging in your face...

58
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,226
- 所以 下周见罗？ - 好的
- So, see you next weekend. All right? - Okay.

59
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,395
谢谢您！- 晚安
- Thank you. - Good night.

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,855
- 再见 - 再见
- Bye. - Bye!

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,106
再见
Bye!

62
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,986
哦 天啊
Oh, gee.

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
看看这个
Look at this.

64
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,837
- 现在你说冲 - 冲啊！
- Now you say go. - Go!

65
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,632
粉碎
Smash.

66
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,384
好了 过去点
All right, squeeze in.

67
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,886
你不能每天早上都这样做 太老土了
You know, you can't do this every morning. It's way too corny.

68
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,638
来吧 笑一个
Come on. Smile.

69
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,724
我只做到他18岁
It's just till he's 18.

70
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,854
- 一份礼物 - 哦 太棒了 这是什么？
- A present. - Oh, great. What's that?

71
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,358
你讨厌刷牙 用这个只要30秒
You hate brushing your teeth and that brushes them in 30 seconds.

72
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,611
我爱刷牙 不要相信你妈说的
I love brushing my teeth. Don't believe everything your mother says.

73
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,239
- 你最后一堂课几点？ - 三点
- What time's your last class? - 3:00.

74
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,533
但我有些考卷要改 你可以去接卢克吗？
But I got some papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?

75
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,036
经过昨天的事 我可能已经失业了 所以…
After yesterday, I probably don't have a job anyway, so...

76
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,372
说她胸大无脑是我的错吗？
Was it wrong of me to call her a useless cow?

77
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,710
我认为是老板的都会欣赏那种坦诚的交流
I think bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.

78
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,212
- 打给你爸了吗？ - 什么时候？
- Did you call your dad? - When?

79
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,840
他生日 昨天！
Birthday, yesterday!

80
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,301
有啊 我送他一些新鲜的鲜花 粉红色的小玫瑰
Yeah, I sent him some freshly cut flowers, little pink roses.

81
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,012
还给他一张手工制作的卡片
I sent him a handmade card.

82
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,015
而我年初开始缝的被子已经完工了
And I finished that quilt I've been sewing since spring.

83
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,142
你真是多才多艺
You are completely impossible.

84
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,645
那你知道我今年的生日得到了啥呢？ 我得到了打呼声
Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? I got a grunt.

85
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,982
妈妈说：“祝你生日快乐 亲爱的 ”而爸爸就…
Mom said, "Happy birthday, sweetheart," and Dad went...

86
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,609
这真是…这是一个我人生最美丽的时刻 我都哭了
It was just... It was a beautiful moment in my life. I teared up.

87
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,488
“胰岛素” 一家之主成熟点好吗？
Ever think that somebody has to be the bigger person here?

88
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,116
你要记住这事 以后作证
Now I want you to remember this for the custody hearing,

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,285
妈妈总是爱念爸爸 好吗？
how Mommy is always scolding Daddy, okay?

90
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,453
你会记得吗？
Can you remember that?

91
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,829
到老你就知道
You know, how are you gonna feel

92
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,331
卢克长大后 你的生日连通电话他都不打
when Luke grows up and doesn't call you on your birthday?

93
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,292
而现在她试图离间我们的感情
And now she's trying to drive a wedge between us.

94
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,253
- 好 我放弃 - 现在 她放弃你了
- I give up. - And now she's abandoning you.

95
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,594
嘿 哥们 你想试再击倒他一次？
Hey, buddy, do you wanna try and knock him over again?

96
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,056
准备好了吗？对准它
You ready? Line it up.

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,019
- 瞄准后喊冲 - 冲啊
- Line it up now and you say go. - Go!

98
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,272
我来开门
I got it.

99
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,986

- Arrest for what? - ...and a search warrant for the premises.

101
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,364

我要逮捕你
I will arrest you.

106
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,123
你被指控谋杀了伊丽莎白 吉赛斯
You're under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.

107
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,708
冷静！- 我的孩子还在厨房！
- Calm down! - I got my kid in the kitchen!

108
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,251
你在干什么？逮捕她是为了什么？
What are you doing? Arrest her for what?

109
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,295
- 转身 - 妈咪！
- Turn around! - Mommy!

110
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,797
- 约翰！约翰！ - 你有权请律师…
- John! John! - You have the right to an attorney...

111
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,340
照顾卢克 照顾卢克
Go get Luke. Go get Luke.

112
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,382
- 你有权利…… - 卢克！
- ...understand these rights... - Luke!

113
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,093
没关系 孩子！没关系！
It's okay, buddy! It's okay!

114
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,303
- 妈咪！ - 卢克！
- Mommy! - Luke!

115
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,681
不会有事的 没事的！
It's all right. It's okay!

116
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,984
爸爸！爸爸！
Daddy! Daddy!

117
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,156
- 爸爸！ - 怎么了？发生什么事 伙计？
- Daddy! - What's wrong? What's wrong, buddy?

118
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,241
发生什么事 ?
What's wrong?

119
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,745
我抱抱
I got you.

120
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,547
嗯 你可以睡这儿…
Well, you can stay in here

121
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:51,512
只要你睡在床的这一面 好吗？
as long as you sleep on this side of the bed, all right?

122
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,059
装哭? 狡猾…
You little snake.

123
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,231
我不知道为什么我一直被骗
I don't know why I keep falling for the same old trick.

124
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,651
你还挺有一手 不是吗？
You have your tricks, don't you?

125
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,864
嘿 快睡觉

- Did he say something mean? About Mom? - Yeah.

130
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,774
- 你打他？  - 对
- Did you hit him? - Yeah.

131
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,277
好 你在哪里打他？
Good. Where'd you hit him?

132
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,071
在操场上
On the playground.

133
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,491
哇！那一定很痛“县立监狱”
Wow! That must have hurt.

134
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,622
站在别动 孩子
Hold it there, son.

135
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,419
只是个玩具
It's a toy.

136
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,137
感谢你
Thank you.

137
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,432
嘿 没事
Hey. All right.

138
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,477
另一只手臂
And the other arm.

139
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,606
不要担心车车 我们等下会拿回来
Don't worry about the car. We'll get it back later, okay?

140
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,333
嘿
Hey!

141
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,848
嗨 亲爱的！
Hi, honey!

142
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,017
嗨
Hey.

143
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,230
你不给妈咪一个吻？
You won't give Mommy a kiss?

144
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,857
可以亲妈咪一下吗？
Can Mommy please have a kiss?

145
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,277
讨厌鬼 给你妈妈一个吻
Rat-bag. Give your mom a kiss.

146
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,408
- 爸爸有念我的信给你听吗？ - 每天晚上睡觉前
- Is Daddy reading you my letters? - Every night at bedtime.

147
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,659
是吗?
Yeah?

148
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,290
你好香
You smell so good.

149
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,209
你打算盖什么呢？
What are you gonna build today?

150
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,130
你要盖一个堡垒？
You gonna build a fort?

151
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,552
大门吗？还是城堡？
A door? Or a castle?

152
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,725
嘿
Hey.

153
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,236
他害怕去上学？
Was he scared going to school?

154
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,740
不会 我陪着他一起走路上学 给了他一个吻 他就走进去
No. I walked him to his class, gave him a kiss, he just walked right in.

155
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,367
甚至没有回头挥个手
Didn't even turn back for a wave.

156
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,088
看看小朋友们！
Look at his friends!

157
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,760
是他的书桌
And his desk.

158
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,767
- 你的第一天如何？ - 非常好
- How was your first day? - Excellent.

159
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,103
只有一半学生睡着 你知道
Half the class stayed awake, you know.

160
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,065
- 我跟你妈谈过 - 她会来？
- I talked to your mom. - When is she coming?

161
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,571
她的生意有很多麻烦 所以…
She's having a lot of trouble with her business, so...

162
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,577
好吧 这才几年而已 她会处理好的
Well, it's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it.

163
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,499
有任何消息吗？
Have you heard anything?

164
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,459
关于上诉？
About the appeal?

165
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,545
有啊 我刚刚决定不告诉你
Yeah, and I've just decided not to tell you.

166
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,090
- 记得 迈尔说的 - 千万别划地自限
- Remember what Meyer said. - Don't.

167
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,218
可能需要几个月让法庭作出裁决
It can take months for a court to make a ruling.

168
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,389
我有看到那个女人 她在那里 她不可能就消失了
I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared.

169
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,973
迈尔在寻求重起调查
Meyer is looking for a new investigator.

170
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,018
她的外套钩住我的皮包 我还听到钮扣掉了
Her coat snagged my purse, and I felt that button pop,

171
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,645
他们是瞎子 如果他们不能找到它
and they're blind if they can't find it.

172
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,731
他要再次检查过所有的证据
He's gonna go through all the evidence again.

173
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,819
那很好 因为我们还没有完全破产
That's great, because we're not quite bankrupt yet.

174
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,487
我们很好
We're fine.

175
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,490
无论你一再说谎哄我
How you just lie and lie.

176
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,744
你还是如此英俊
But you're so handsome.

177
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,252
你能帮我一个忙吗？
Can you do me a favor?

178
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,503
我不知道 我有点忙
I don't know, I'm kind of busy.

179
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,088
我要你去选州长
I need you to run for governor.

180
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,423
我能做到
I can do that.

181
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,801
你就可以更改牢里夫妻会面的规则了
You can change this rule about no conjugal visits,

182
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,971
因为我不认为我可以再撑 20年
'cause I don't think I can last another 20 years.

183
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,348
嘿
Hey.

184
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,022
我没事
I'm okay.

185
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,110
- 我没事 - 一切都会好转的
- I'm okay. - Everything is gonna be all right.

186
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,487
我保证
I promise.

187
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,080
你想他还会愿意吻我吗？
You think he'll ever kiss me again?

188
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,056
请你站起身来
I need you to stand up.

189
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:50,370
碰 捉到你了
Tag, you're it.

190
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,418
卢克！该走了 野猴子
Luke! Let's go, yard ape.

191
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,714
嘿
Hey.

192
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,050
- 好玩吗？  - 好玩
- Have fun? - Yeah.

193
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,135
她疯疯的 对不对 那个小女孩？
She's kind of crazy, that little girl, right?

194
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,515
该走了 嘉莉！
Time to go, Carrie!

195
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,100
不要！
No!

196
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,100
他甚至看都没看一眼
He didn't even read the thing.

197
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:48,184
不用多久 我告诉你…他会看的
Half the time, I'm telling you... We'll get him in there.

198
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,507
如果我们找到那个离开停车场的女人勒？
What happens if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?

199
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,469
法庭速记已经拒绝了
The PCRA has been rejected.

200
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,221
不可以提交新的证据 一个都不行
No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore.

201
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,348
那是抢劫啦
It was a robbery.

202
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,476
如果嫌犯用过她的信用卡 我们就有论点了
And if they had used her credit card, we could have argued that.

203
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,269
我…我很抱歉
I'm... I'm sorry.

204
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,521
约翰…
John...

205
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,983
这真糟
This sucks.

206
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,487
好了 就是这样
Okay. That's that.

207
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,909
我们现在只能仰赖最高法院了 对不对？
All we have now is the Supreme Court, right?

208
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,788
约翰 在过去 30年来
John, in the last 30 years,

209
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,374
最高法院没有听审过任何谋杀案
the Supreme Court has not heard one murder case.

210
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,544
任何大律师都不会具件上诉
No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.

211
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,300
所以 我所要做的就是找到一个“不那么伟大”的律师吗？
So, all I have to do is find an indecent one?

212
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:53,183
这应该不会太难
That shouldn't be too hard.

213
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,641
我会上诉
I'll file it.

214
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,187
但我需要你为我做一些事情
But I need you to do something for me.

215
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,064
什么事？
What?

216
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:09,528
我要你好好看看证据 忘记拉娜是你的妻子
I need you to look at the evidence and forget that Lara's your wife.

217
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,156
我看过证据 迈尔
I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

218
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:17,452
我不是在评断她无辜或有罪 我只说你去看证据
I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it.

219
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,832
她的同事看到她离开现场
Her co-worker sees her leaving the scene,

220
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:26,002
在她的衣服有受害人的血液 凶器上都是她的指纹
the victim's blood is on her clothes, her fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

221
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,129
然后跟我们去吃晚饭？
And then we went out to dinner.

222
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,090
如果你刚刚杀了人你会这么做？
How do you do that if you just killed somebody?

223
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,299
那法官会认为她有精神病质
That would make her a psychopath.

224
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,176
- 还有争执… - 你说拉娜是精神病患？
- And the fight... - Is Lara a psychopath?

225
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,429
- 在办公室的争执呢 ？ - 每个人都会跟自己的老板吵架！
- The fight in the office? - Everyone fights with their boss!

226
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,639
但不会闹出人命啊
But this one ended up dead.

227
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,185
那你的意思是 你从来都不相信她是清白的？
So what you're saying is that you never believed in her innocence?

228
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,146
- 你怎么能这么说？ - 你要说什么 迈尔？
- How can you say that? - What are you saying, Meyer?

229
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,274
我是说 我们现在相信什么不重要了
I'm saying that it no longer matters what we believe,

230
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,735
拉娜是不可能逃得掉了！
Lara is not getting out!

231
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,953
你不知道我多不想这么说
And you have no idea how much I hate to say that.

232
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,918
我会找别人提上诉
I will find someone to file the pleadings.

233
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,003
约翰
John.

234
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,422
约翰 拜托 约翰！
John, come on. John!

235
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,965
约翰！
John!

236
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,051
约翰！看在老天份上！
John! For Christ's sakes!

237
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,271
别这样吧
Come on.

238
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,398
我们去跟狗狗玩 好吗？
We'll find Scout, okay?

239
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,375
感谢你
Thank you.

240
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:32,105
“给一个大拥抱给企鹅 小企鹅 琪琪和小袋鼠
"And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Kiki and Opossumy.

241
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,066
很爱很爱你的 妈咪   “
"Lots and lots of love, Mommy."

242
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,277
我们要写回信吗？
Should we write her back?

243
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,448
我能拿个铜板吗？
Can I have a quarter?

244
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,576
你要拿个铜板？
Can you have a quarter?

245
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,165
可以啊 可是这些是不能花的喔
Yeah, but you know you can't spend these.

246
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,793
因为他们是从乡下小屋拿来的 我和妈妈常带你去…
Because they come from the cottage where Mom and I used to take you

247
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,712
当你还是个小婴儿时
when you were a baby.

248
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,298
那可以都给我吗？
Then can I have them all?

249
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,634
当然
Sure.

250
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,700
我的妻子 拉娜布伦南 她被送到了这里
My wife, Lara Brennan, she was sent up here.

251
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,245
- 布伦南 布-伦-南 - 我很抱歉 但她被禁客访
- Brennan, B-R-E-N-N-A-N. - I'm sorry, but she can't have visitors.

252
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,622
离谱 我要见她
That's ridiculous. I have to see her.

253
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,165
- 拉娜！拉娜！ - 我很抱歉
- Lara! Lara! - I'm sorry.

254

- 你不能进去！ - 嘿 嘿 站住 停在那儿
- You can't be in here! - Hey, hey, stop. Stop right there.

- What the hell is going on? - My wife attempted suicide.

259

They brought her up here. I have to see her, please.

260
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,427
- 她不允许访客 - 为什么她不是在急诊室？
- She's not allowed visitors. - So why isn't she in the ER?

261
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,472
- 因为她是县立监狱转来的 - 只用两分钟 拜托
- Because she's a transfer from County Jail. - Just two minutes, please.

Two minutes.

263
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,397
好
Okay.

264
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,233
感谢你
Thank you.

265
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,534
两分钟
Two minutes.

266
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,242
因此 唐吉诃德的一生与他的时代
So, The Life and Times of Don Quixote.

267
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,162
它是怎样的呢？
What is it about?

268
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:56,916
信仰美德 比美德本身更重要？
That someone's belief in virtue is more important than virtue itself?

269
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,337
是的 当时的确是 但究竟说的是什么呢？
Yes, that's in there. But what is it about?

270
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:08,595
难道是说理性的思维会如何摧毁你的灵魂？
Could it be about how rational thought destroys your soul?

271
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,976
难道是谈非理性是如何强大 终将胜利？
Could it be about the triumph of irrationality and the power that's in that?

272
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,980
你知道 我们花了很多时间来组织世界
You know, we spend a lot of time trying to organize the world.

273
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:23,109
我们发明时钟和日历 我们甚至尝试预报天气
We build clocks and calendars and we try and predict the weather.

274
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,699
但是 我们的生活的哪一部分是真正的在我们的控制之下？
But what part of our life is truly under our control?

275
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,135
如果我们选择相信的纯粹只是自己想像的现实呢？
What if we choose to exist purely in a reality of our own making?

276
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,140
这是否会使我们疯狂？
Does that render us insane?

277
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,150
如果是这样 生命不就只是绝望？“越狱高手的自传”
And if it does, isn't that better than a life of despair?

278
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,499
这是一个课程 探讨驱使人不计代价追寻自由的原因
It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost.

279
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,586
其他老师教小狗玩赏吗？
Some other teacher had dibs on Papillon?

280
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,550
你从监狱逃出七次
You escaped from jail seven times.

281
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,594
你想知道什么？
What do you want to know?

282
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,097
为什么只有你作得到 别人不行
How you escaped when no one else could.

283
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,432
胆子和一点点运气
Balls and a little luck.

284
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,768
世界上没有监狱是真的密不透风
No prison in the world is airtight.

285
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,521
每座监狱都有一把“钥匙” 看你如何找到它
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

286
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,148
你怎么做到的呢？
How do you do that?

287
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,400
仔细观察
A lot of looking.

288
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,778
特别是那些不合常规的事
Especially at things that break up the daily routine.

289
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,782
守卫们每一逃诩习于做着同样的事情
Guards get comfortable doing the same thing day in, day out.

290
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,493
一旦意外发生 这时候他们就可能犯错
Something happens, that's when they make mistakes.

291
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,413
当你看到机会时 你必须做好准备
When you see it, you have to be ready.

292
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,957
你必须有着全面而周详的计划
You have to have the entire plan already in place,

293
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,918
甚至在你还不知道要如何逃狱前就计划
even before you know how you're going to get out ofjail.

294
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,130
逃逸是容易的 最难的是保持自由
Escaping is easy, the hardest part is staying free.

295
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:12,051
你要知道你要去哪里以及你如何能到达那里
You have to know where you're gonna go and how you're gonna get there.

296
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,930
你要知道他们打算如何抓住你 何时何地
You have to know how they plan to catch you, where and when.

297
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,850
那么 你到底是如何知道那些的？
Well, how the hell are you supposed to know that?

298
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,019
付钱给知道的人
You pay off someone who knows.

299
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,897
还有监狱是在乡下或城里也有关系
And a lot depends on if the prison is in the country or the city.

300
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,064
城里
City.

301
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,578
你从哪里来？
Where are you from?

302
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,080
匹兹堡
Pittsburgh.

303
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,252
匹兹堡监狱很难
Pittsburgh's tough.

304
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,340
他们有太多桥梁和隧道可以设点抓你
So many bridges and tunnels they can block off.

305
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,800
从他们开始打电话
From the time they make the call,

306
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,888
警方15分钟内就能封锁整个市中心
the police can have the center of the city sealed tight in 15 minutes.

307
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,473
他们啥时变得如此精实？
How can they be so exact?

308
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,018
911之后 国土安全局规定每一个城市都制定锁城计划
After 9/11, Homeland Security made every city have a lockdown plan.

309
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,606
匹兹堡 费城 波士顿 明尼波利斯 都是15分钟
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

310
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,900
全城警戒
They can do D.C. in under 10.

311
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:13,112
35分钟内 每个州际收费站都会有警察站岗
Within 35 minutes, they can have cops at every tollbooth on the interstate

312
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,990
而且二级公路上开始交通管制
and be running rolling stops on the secondary roads.

313
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,743
他们还不会有你的照片 但他们会有你的描述
They won't have your photograph yet, but they will have your description.

314
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,830
如果走不掉呢？三十五分钟的时间不是很多
What if you can't get out? Thirty-five minutes is not a lot of time.

315
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:23,915
只好投降
Then surrender.

316
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,461
否则他们会当场击毙你 以及你的任何同伙
Because they will shoot you on sight, along with anyone else you're with.

317
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,464
远离火车和巴士站
Stay far away from the train and bus stations.

318
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,259
忘了当地机场 去另一州搭飞机
Forget the local airports. Leave from another state.

319
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,137
第二 身份证明 找到假证件很容易
Second, identity. It's easy to find fake papers,

320
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,974
找到能通机场关的 很难
harder to find ones that will get you through an airport.

321
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:45,520
你需要一本护照 驾驶执照和社会安全号码
You'll need a passport, a driver's license and a social security number.

322
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,023
如果你要租一辆车 找一个收现金支票的地方
If you have to rent a car, find a place that will take a cash deposit.

323
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:53,486
他们还是会做信用检查 因此要用真有其人的名字和证件
They'll still run a credit check, so use a real person's name on the ID.

324
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,238
第三 目的地
Third, destination.

325
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,407
找个不吸引美国游客的地方
You want somewhere that doesn't attract American tourists.

326
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,119
例如叶门之类的
Think Yemen, and you get the idea.

327
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,372
还有钱 你需要很多很多钱
And money, you'll need a truckload of it.

328
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,959
一切都很贵 酒店 旅游 资讯
Everything's expensive, hotels, travel, information.

329
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,794
要多少 ？
How much?

330
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,171
至少要够五 六年用
Enough to last at least five, six years.

331
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,383
你的钱用完了 你的朋友也用完了
You run out of money, you run out of friends.

332
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:23,433
但在你做任何事情之前 你要问自己 真能做到吗
But before you do anything, you have to ask yourself if you can do it.

333
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,561
你能不妄想再见到你的父母吗？
Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again?

334
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,398
你能杀死警卫？把你的孩子一个人留在加油站？
Can you kill a guard? Leave your kid at a gas station?

335
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,734
把某个无辜的老太太推到地上
Push some nice old lady to the ground

336
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,861
只因为她挡到你的逃生去路？
just because she gets between you and the door?

337
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:38,614
因为要做这件事情 你就要变成这种人
Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become.

338
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,535
如果你不能 就别蠢动
And if you can't, don't start,

339
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,539
因为你只会害别人死
'cause you'll just get someone killed.

340
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,375
你是怎么被抓的？
How did you get caught?

341
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,339
我自己投降了
I gave myself up.

342
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,636
我没法睡觉 因为一直担心有人破门而入
I couldn't take wondering when someone was gonna come through the bedroom door.

343
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,809
所以 你口袋里有多少？
So, what do you have in your pocket?

344
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,369
祝你好运
Good luck.

345
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,937
世界上没有监狱是真的密不透风的
No prison in the world is airtight.

346
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,356
每座监狱都有一把钥匙 看你如何找到它
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

347
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,109
你怎么做到的呢？
How do you do that?

348
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,444
仔细观察
A lot of looking.

349
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,363
特别是那些不合常规的事
Especially at things that break up the daily routine.

在您左侧 是阿勒格尼县监狱 目前世界上最大的监狱
And on the left, the Allegheny County Jail, now the largestjail in the world.

351
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,340
发生过三次越狱 没有人活着离开
There have been three escape attempts of which no one has made it out alive.

352
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,468
如果你看看右边 是南侧…
If you look to the right, south side...

353
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,099
“在第一个楼梯间 这是个很小的楼梯转弯处
"On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed,

354
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,768
“柱子中有一个缝隙 大约半码宽
"there was a niche in the column, about half a yard wide,

355
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,314
“ 然而在此缝隙中 王子不禁认为 有一个人站在隐蔽处
"and in this niche, the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed.

356
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,192
“他认为他可以分辨出有人站在那里”…
"He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there..."

357
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,034
25 26 27
25, 26, 27,

358

363

然后 我们要用到我们的魔术套索工具

364

向后仰
Put your head back.

392

有人开拉娜的玩笑
Some guy made a crack about Lara.

393
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,069
所以 这就是你现在的作法？揍每个认为她有罪的人？
So that's what you do now? You punch everybody who thinks she's guilty?

394
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,654
你是什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

395
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,032
我是说重要的是你怎么想
It means it's important what you believe,

396
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,617
- 不要去管别人… - 真的吗？
- not what somebody else... - Really?

397
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,203
- 你相信她吗 妈妈？ - 怎么你想开始吵架了？
- Do you believe, Mom? - Why are you trying to start a fight?

来吧 伙计 我们走吧 他的包包在哪里？
Come on, buddy. Let's go. Where's his bag?

399

- 你为什么要这样？ - 不为什么
- Why are you doing this? - No reason.

400
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,833
我只是愚蠢地认为 凡是爱她的人
I just stupidly thought that the people who loved her

401
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,294
都会相信她是清白的 我错了
would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake.

402
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,462

不 我… 我没有
No, I... I didn't.

409

没关系
That's okay.

410
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,029

416
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,866

I'm deaf, you idiot. I read your lips.

417
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,172

You're gonna fuck it up.

457
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,408
嘿 布伦南先生
Hey, Mr. Brennan.

458
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:47,457
今天我要告诉你如何制造一把万能钥匙
Today I'm gonna show you how to make a key that can open any lock.

459
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,251
这就是所谓的“敲击”钥匙
It's called a bump key.

460
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,628
首先你要找到一把钥匙
First thing you need to do is you need to find a key

461
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:54,298
可以放入你试图打开的锁就行
that can fit into the type of lock that you're trying to open.

462
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,758
这里 我有一把可以放入大门的
Here I have a key that fits into my front door,

463
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,721
但我已换了锁 所以它打不开
but I just changed the locks, so it won't open.

464
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,432
首先找一把适合的钥匙
First thing you need to do is secure your key,

465
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:08,020
拿支铁锉刀来磨 像这样锉出棱角来
take a metal file and go through and start taking those mountains and valleys

466
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,689
有些地方要锉得深一点
all the way down to the lowest possible setting on the key.

467
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,317
“敲击”钥匙的重点在于 撞击瞬间的掌握
The bump key works by momentarily bumping those pins up,

468
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,526
因此 抓对那个瞬间
so that for a split second,

469
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:19,197
锁孔内的珠针会弹开 钥匙就能转开锁
the chamber is cleared of pins and thus, able to turn and open.

470
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,510
- 给你 - 请勿触摸
- Here you go. - Don't touch that.

471
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,762
- 抱歉 - 想抢我的工作？
- Sorry. - Trying to do my job?

472
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,066
那么 你在影片中哪里？
So you are where in here?

473
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,030
我在这里中间
I'm in the middle there.

474
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,533
在中间 你能指出自己吗？
In the middle. Can you point to yourself?

475
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,202
这就是我
That's me.

476
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,661
那
There.

477
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,543
所以靠近电梯的不是你
So that's not you back there by the elevators.

478
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:22,797
不 不 我是在这里的某个地方
No, no, I was around here somewhere.

479
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,885
你要老实告诉我吗？
You wanna tell me what's going on?

480
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,305
告诉你什么？
You want me to tell you?

481
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,059
是啊
Yes.

482
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,896
你知道什么是“敲击”钥匙吗？
Do you know what a bump key is?

483
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,190
什么？
Sorry?

484
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,533
如果这是你
If this was you,

485
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,328
你应该考虑到你孩子的未来
you might wanna think about what's gonna happen to your kids

486
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,664
如果他的父母都被关进牢里的话
if both their parents end up in prison.

487
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,168
爸爸
Dad?

488
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,049
爸爸
Dad!

489
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,718
来了 伙计
Yeah, bud.

490
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,970
嗯
Yeah.

491
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,350
谢谢
Thanks.

492
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:26,773
因此 我们逮捕了他的妻子 现在我们控告他呕吐?
So we arrested his wife, and now we're gonna charge the man with vomiting.

493
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,735
他想卖房子 或者 有人要跟他买
He's selling the house. Or he has a buyer.

494
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,239
在这种景气？幸运的人
In this market? Lucky man.

495
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:38,118
我们现在可以去做警察的工作了吗？
Can we possibly go do police work now?

496
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,082
我现在知道你为什么这么久没结婚了
I don't know how you managed to stay single this long.

497
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,556
爸爸 我能吃饼干吗？
Dad, can I have my cookies?

498
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,184
- 你饿了吗？要吃个三明治？ - 不会
- You hungry? You want a sandwich? - No.

499
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,564

501
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:20,285
我很抱歉 她刚刚才懂点事
I'm sorry. She's just already got it all figured out.

502
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,872
我是妮可
Nicole.

503
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,791

卢克应该有拿这个回家

507

他跟他爸一样记性差
He has his father's memory.

It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please, come. I'd love to meet your wife.

她不会去
She won't be there.

510
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,992
说来话长
It's complicated.

511
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,829
我明白了 和我有关
I understand. With me, too.

512

525
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,511

I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?

526
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,768
不 她不是这样的
No, she's not like that.

527
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,688
她在监狱里
She's in prison.

528
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,986
- 我没跟什么人说 - 我明白了
- I don't tell most people. - I understand.

529
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,863
她是清白的 她没有杀那个女人
She's innocent. She didn't kill that woman.

530
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,324
好 我的意思是…
Good. I mean...

531
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,411
我敢肯定她没有
I'm sure she didn't.

532
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,499
我们真的该回家了
We really should be going home.

533
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,834
好
Okay.

534
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:36,921
非常感谢您的邀请 我们尽可能到
Thank you very much for the invitation. We'll try and make it.

535
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,798
那就太好了
That would be great.

536
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,259
- 再见 卢克！ - 再见
- Goodbye. Luke! - Bye.

537
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,428
来吧
Come on.

538
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,604
嘉莉 走吧！
Carrie, come on!

539
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,899
嘿  嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

540
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,526
怎么了?
What's wrong?

541
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,612
这是什么？
What is it?

542
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,497
不
No.

543
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,251
他们不能没先通知就要你移监
They can't move you without notice.

544
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,336
只三天不算先通知了
Three days isn't notice.

545
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,674
我只是在这里提上诉 我们早知道要去另一个监狱
I was only here through the appeal. We knew I was going to a prison.

546
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,932
不 不 我没有两个星期 我明天就要停止代管契约
No, no, I don't have two weeks. I gotta close the escrow tomorrow.

547
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,852
可是 你的名字甚至还没有拿下来呢 就没有办法让我…
Well, the title hasn't even been cleared yet. I mean, there's no way I can...

548
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,186
他们可以给我多少钱？
How much can they give me?

549
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:03,688
一毛都没
Nothing!

550
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,385
你们怎么跑来了？
What are you doing here?

551
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,095
我有课
I've got class.

552
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,058
你要乖 好吗？
You be good, okay?

553
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,230
谢谢
Thanks.

554
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,305
你没事吧？你们好吗？
Are you okay? You're okay?

555
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,723
- 你没事吧？ - 你在干什么？
- Are you okay? - What are you doing?

556
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,016
你几乎撞死我们！
You almost killed us!

557
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,184
我非常 非常抱歉
I'm so, so sorry.

558
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,019
你真的疯了 看也没看
You're out of your mind. You don't look.

559
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,231
走开 离我们远点！
Get away. Get away from us!

560
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,766
嘿
Hey.

561
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,024
怎么回事?
What's wrong?

562
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,108
没事
Nothing.

563
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,860
是卢克吗？
Is it Luke?

564
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,403
- 不是 - 那是什么？
- No. - What?

565
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,951
我…我问过梅耶
I... I asked Meyer

566
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,996
设法中止你转移监狱
to look into not having you moved.

567
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:12,960
我告诉他说 长距离旅行对我们有困难
I told him that traveling that distance would be a hardship on us,

568
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,129
卢克在学校已经有问题了 这是真的
that Luke was already having problems at school, which is true.

569
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,214
我没有足够的时间陪他
I haven't been spending enough time with him.

570
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,175
你没有？
You haven't?

571
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:20,593
真的
No.

572
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,970
你有没有？
You haven't?

573
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,683
老天 约翰
Jesus, John.

574
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,771
你已经做太多了
You really are too much.

575
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:36,692
卢克是过得不好 但那是因为妈妈是个杀人犯
Luke is having a hard time, because Mommy's in jail for murder,

576
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:40,196
不是因为爸爸没有花足够的时间陪他
not because Daddy doesn't spend enough time with him.

577
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,909
你父亲是对的 你真的不是和我们生活在同一个世界
Your father was right. You really don't live in the same world we do.

578
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,997
很好 你们还说得上话
That's nice, that the two of you talk.

579
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,792
我住在什么样的世界中 拉娜？
What world do I live in, Lara?

580
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,461
嗯 我不知道 约翰 但它不是真实的
Well, I don't know, John, but it's not the real one.

581
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,838
在其中的一个我将在这度过余生
The one in which I'm in here for the rest of my life.

582
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:01,550
所以不要跟我那样说话 幻想还能有幸福快乐的日子…
So don't be talking to me about fantasies like there's some happily ever...

583
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:03,344
安分点 好吗？
We good here?

584
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,015
是的 抱歉
Yes. Sorry.

585
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,572
现在 你要坐在这垮着脸 像是你让我失望了
Now you're gonna sit here all long-faced, like you let me down.

586
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,095
我的意思是 你要我怎么做？
I mean, what do you want me to do here?

587
01:02:25,095 --> 01:02:26,534
你要我怎么做让你感觉好点？
You want me to make you feel better?

588
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:27,827
了解
Got it.

589
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,121
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

590
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:31,789
现在你道歉了
Now you're apologizing.

591
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,833
你真的是个活宝
You really are a gem.

592
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:37,044
- 你要我怎么做 拉娜？ - 我要你怎么做？什么也不用
- What do you want from me, Lara? - What do I want from you? Nothing.

593
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:38,879
你已经太完美
You're already too perfect.

594
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:42,007
你甚至从来不问我 是不是我做的
You know, you never even asked me if I did it.

595
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,136
- 人是不是我杀的… - 因为我知道你没有
- If I killed her. - Because I know you didn't.

596
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,304
嗯 那你就错了
Well, then you'd be wrong.

597
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,778
是我做的
I'm done.

598
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,357
先生 你不能站在那儿
Sir, you can't stand there.

599
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,986
先生 请你立刻离开大楼
Sir, I need you to leave the building now.

600
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:45,821
先生？
Sir?

601
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,798
- 怎么了？ - 闭嘴
- What? - Shut up.

602
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,470
我不在乎你说什么或你怎么说
I don't care what you say or how you say it.

603
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:12,806
我不相信是你做的
I don't believe you did it.

604
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,310
永远不相信
And I never will.

605
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,733
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

606
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,112
而我向你保证
And I promise you

607
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,950
你不会在此过余生
this will not be your life.

608
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,438
停止
Shut up!

609
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,578
- 我不知道发生了什么事情 - 你做了什么？
- I don't know what's going on, man. - You done?

610

Everybody is out.

你敢射狗 我就杀了你！
You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!

616
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,220

623
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,782
- 我没有做任何事情 - 是你带他来这里！

624
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,366
我没带他！
I didn't bring him!

625

626

627
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,885
在这里 拿了钱快滚

637
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,203
你只是装模作样而已

- 找到些什么？ - 该死的奇蹟

而你真的不知道他们要去哪里 对不对？
And you have absolutely no idea where they're going, right?

939

在登机口拦下大家 看看这个

968
01:58:45,494 --> 01:58:49,705
你有想过吗 为什么我们只找到这袋 而没找到其他的？
You ever ask yourself why we found this bag and not the others?

我们在这里干什么？
What are we doing here?
