Today I'm gonna show you how to make a key that can open any lock.

457
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,480

It's called a bump key.

458
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,880

First thing you need to do is you need to find a key

459
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,550
�պ������뿪������С�ʺ�
that can fit into the type of lock that you're trying to open.

���Կ�׺��ҵ�ǰ���ʺ�
Here I have a key that fits into my front door,

462
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,690
������Ҫȷ��Կ�׵İ�ȫ
First thing you need to do is secure your key,

463
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,260
��һ����� ��Կ���ϵĿ���
take a metal file and go through and start taking those mountains and valleys

465
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,570
ײ����ͨ����ʱ��ײ��������
The bump key works by momentarily bumping those pins up,

466
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,770
��ʱ���
so that for a split second,

the chamber is cleared of pins and thus, able to turn and open.
