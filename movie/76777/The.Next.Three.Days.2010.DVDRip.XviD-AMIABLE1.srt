1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,469
求你  送我去医院
Please, get me to a hospital!

2
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,416
我喘不过来气
I can't breathe.

3
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,103
最后三年

4
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,941
你要是知趣的话
You know what? If you were smart,

5
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,064
现在就该闭嘴
you would stop talking right now.

6
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,709
告我啊  我就知道女人不该为女人打工
Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women.

7
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,902
怎么能那么说
How can you say that?

8
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,138
因为她们总是觉得有威胁
Because they're always threatened.

9
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,408
特别当你是个美女  而他们不是
Especially if you're beautiful, and they're not.

10
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,143
好吧  你从来没和你老板吵过架吗
Fine! You never had a fight with your boss?

11
00:01:58,722 --> 00:01:59,932
从来不  知道为什么吗
Never. You know why?

12
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,014
因为他是男人
Because he's a man.

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,680
我们就此打住好吗
Can we please drop this?

14
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,690
我只想回家亲亲我儿子  甜心
I just want to go home and kiss my son. Honey.

15
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,853
听听  你非得提儿子挤兑我们没有是吗
See, you have to mention that you have a child and we don't.

16
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,693
-我听出来了  -艾莉特  我根本没那个意思
- There's my point. - Erit, I didn't say anything of the sort.

17
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,199
不用道歉  生来如此
Don't apologize, it's genetics.

18
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,326
女人总是彼此竞争
Women are always competing with each other.

19
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,200
所以你才会对你的老板有意见
That's why you're having problems with your boss.

20
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,500
-因为她是女人  -一点儿没错
- Because she's a woman. - Exactly.

21
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,721
要么男人当女人的老板
Women should work under men,

22
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,702
要么女人当男人的老板  
men under women. That's it.

23
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,412
男人当男人老板如何
What about men under men?

24
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,344
也行  我想  他们能搞定
That's fine, too. I mean, they can deal with it.

25
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:30,278
我们能走了吗
Can we go now?

26
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:31,265
你们谁还想再喝一杯
Either of you guys want another drink?

27
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,771
-我们喝好了  -就两杯
- We're good shot. - Double?

28
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,352
女人很能干  我就是
Women can do amazing things. I am one. I know.

29
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,945
可我也不会当自己老板
But even I would never work for me.

30
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,853
这个我同意  晚安  米克
That we can agree on. Good night, Mick.

31
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,585
气氛不大对啊
We are in a bad mood.

32
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,174
她很精辟  老兄  你知道
She's got a point, bro, you know.

33
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,060
我更愿意在你下头干事儿
I'd much rather work under you than her.

34
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,164
好极了  我也愿意在他下头干事儿
That's nice. I'd rather work under him, too.

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,804
你愿意在约翰下面"干事儿"
You'd rather "work" under John?

36
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,600
你也有什么不爽吗
You have a problem with that, too?

37
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,962
没有  我为什么要对你那小小的
No! Why would I have a problem

38
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:56,470
性暗示感到不爽呢
with your little sexual innuendo?

39
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,300
你今晚吃错药了吗
What is up your ass tonight?

40
00:02:58,514 --> 00:02:59,354
那我就应该乖乖坐在这里
So I should just sit here 

41
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:01,772
眼睁睁看你在我面前钓我老公吗
while you come on to my husband right in front of me?

42
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,798
劳拉  假如我想钓
Lara, if I wanted your husband,

43
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,715
他早就上钩了  小菜一碟
I would have him, like that.

44
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,013
怎么钓  你连露奶的机会都没有
How? You couldn't possibly show him more of those tits.

45
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,748
-你怎么这么三八  -好了
- You know what your problem is? - Okay...

46
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,086
我三八因为你胸大无脑
My problem is your brain is as big as those tits.

47
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,557
-宝贝儿  这是你的错  -是巨奶  没错
- Baby, this is your fault! - Huge, exactly!

48
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,627
这是你的...
This is your...

49
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,434
你但凡有点脑子  
If you had half a brain, 

50
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:16,378
我们也不会闹成这样  
we wouldn't be having this conversation. 

51
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:16,929
也许碰都碰不上
Maybe we wouldn't even met.

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,659
宝贝儿  算了  算了  算了
Baby. Let it go, let it go, let it go.

53
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,523
-晚安  老弟  -晚安
- Good night, brother dear! - Good night!

54
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,112
她太自以为是了
She's completely full of herself.

55
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:24,659
别想事后拍我马屁
Don't try and agree with me now!

56
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:26,199
我甚至认为她是个冒牌的牙医专家
I don't even think she's a member of the dental profession.

57
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,568
行了
Shut up!

58
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,541
她大概连"麻醉师"几个字都拼不出来
She probably can't even spell "anesthesiologist."

59
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,269
那女人没点儿真的
The woman's a complete fraud.

60
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,874
我们在她的办公室聚会过  笨蛋
We went to her office party, you idiot!

61
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,210
我相信她是那时候迷上我的
And I believe she hit on me that night as well.

62
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,489
简直是自作多情
You are completely delusional.

63
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,877
她看都没看你一眼  我只是看不惯她
She didn't even hit on you in there. I just don't like her.

64
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,353
我理解你的看法  真的  很同意
I understand your point of view. I really do. I agree with you.

65
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,738
她那样的人
Somebody who looks like that

66
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,119
就该离口腔外科远点儿
should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.

67
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,127
你个讨厌鬼
You are an asshole!
 
68
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,762
你坐在椅子上  正想办法放松
You're sitting in the chair, you're trying to stay calm,

68
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,959
一对大波在你眼前晃动...
and you got them things hanging in your face...

69
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,028
-那就下周再见了  好吗  -好的
- So, see you next weekend. All right? - Okay.

70
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,160
-谢谢你  -晚安
- Thank you. - Good night.

71
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,636
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye!

72
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,865
再见
Bye!

73
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,740
天哪
Oh, gee.

74
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,280
看好了
Look at this.

75
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,626
-现在说冲  -冲
- Now you say go. - Go!

76
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,422
冲垮了
Smash all.

77
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,159
好了  照相时间
All right, squeeze in.

78
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,667
你知道  没必要每天这样  老掉牙了
You know, you can't do this every morning. It's way too corny.

79
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,397
少废话  笑一个
Come on. Smile.

80
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,657
到他成年就好了
It's just till he's 18.

81
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,637
-礼物  -太好了  什么啊
- A present. - Oh, great. What's that?

82
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,178
你不是讨厌刷牙嘛
You hate brushing your teeth

83
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,147
那个牙刷三十秒就全部搞定
and that brushes them in 30 seconds.

84
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,367
我超喜欢刷牙
I love brushing my teeth.

85
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,378
别听你妈说的话
Don't believe everything your mother says.

86
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,011
-你最后一节课几点  -三点
- What time's your last class? - 3:00.

87
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,317
可我要批试卷  你能接一下卢克吗  
But I got some papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?

88
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,826
昨天和老板吵架  我可能要被炒鱿鱼了
After yesterday, I probably don't have a job anyway, so...

89
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,123
我骂她没用的娘们儿有错吗
Was it wrong of me to call her a useless cow?

90
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,462
我想老板们对这种实话都很感冒
I think bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.

91
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,963
-你打电话给你爸了吗  -什么时候
- Did you call your dad? - When?

92
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,636
昨天  他生日的时候
Birthday, yesterday!

93
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,107
是啊  我送了他几束鲜花  几束粉玫瑰
Yeah, I sent him some freshly cut flowers, little pink roses.

94
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,802
送了张自制贺卡
I sent him a handmade card.

95
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,813
我还搞定了从春天就开始缝的床单
And I finished that quilt I've been sewing since spring.

96
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,940
你简直不可思议
You are completely impossible.

97
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,345
你知道今年我的生日礼物是什么吗
Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year?

98
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:54,417
一句哼哼
I got a grunt.

99
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,751
妈说  "生日快乐  宝贝"  爸说
Mom said, "Happy birthday, sweetheart," and Dad went...

100
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,382
这是  很感人的时刻  我泪流满面
It was just... It was a beautiful moment in my life. I teared up.

101
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,288
不觉得在这儿  你该有个大人样吗
Ever think that somebody has to be the bigger person here?

102
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,888
现在我要你记住我的证词
Now I want you to remember this for the custody hearing,

103
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,058
你妈是怎么拿你老爹开涮的  懂吗
how Mommy is always scolding Daddy, okay?

104
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,226
记住了吗
Can you remember that?

105
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,795
我说  等卢克长大了
You know, how are you gonna feel

106
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,440
你过生日电话他也不打电话   
when Luke grows up and 

107
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,104
你会是什么感觉
doesn't call you on your birthday?

108
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,072
现在她在咱俩之间设置障碍呢
And now she's trying to drive a wedge between us.

109
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,042
-我投降  -现在她不管你了
- I give up. - And now she's abandoning you.

110
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,342
老兄  想再摞倒他一次吗
Hey, buddy, do you wanna try and knock him over again?

111
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,820
准备好啊  排好队
You ready? Line it up.

112
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,792
-排好队了喊冲  -冲
- Line it up now and you say go. - Go!

113
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,026
我开
I got it.

114
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,767
匹兹堡警察局的  这是劳拉・布伦南的逮捕证
Pittsburgh Police. This is an arrest warrant for Lara Brennan...

115
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,929
-凭什么啊  -还有搜查证
- Arrest for what? - ...and a search warrant for the premises.

116
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,130
-等等  -你是劳拉・布伦南吗
- Hold on! - Lara Brennan?

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,300
-你再碰我一下  我就抓你  -等等
- You touch me again, I'm gonna arrest you. - Hold on.

118
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,775
-待在原地  -这是我家
- Stay where you are! - This is my house!

119
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,936
-劳拉・布伦南吗 -是
- Lara Brennan? - Yes!

120
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,012
我要逮捕你
I will arrest you.

121
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,910
你被控谋杀伊丽莎白・吉萨斯而被逮捕
You're under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.

122
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,482
-稍安毋躁  -我小孩就在厨房
- Calm down! - I got my kid in the kitchen!

123
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,050
你们干什么  凭什么抓她
What are you doing? Arrest her for what?

124
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,086
-转身  -妈咪
- Turn around! - Mommy!

125
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,586
-约翰!  约翰!  -你有权聘律师
- John! John! - You have the right to an attorney...

126
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,121
去看看卢克  去看看卢克
Go get Luke. Go get Luke.

127
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,190
-明白这些权利  -卢克
-...understand these rights... - Luke!

128
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,849
没事儿的  儿子  没事儿
It's okay, buddy! It's okay!

129
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,089
-妈咪  -卢克
- Mommy! - Luke!

130
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,456
乖  没事儿
It's all right. It's okay!

131
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,742
爸爸  爸爸
Daddy! Daddy!

132
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,941
-爸爸  -怎么了  怎么了  伙计
- Daddy! - What's wrong? What's wrong, buddy?

133
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,015
怎么了
What's wrong?

134
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,518
好了
I got you.

135
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,320
你在这边床上
Well, you can stay in here

136
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:49,344
想睡多久就睡多久
as long as you sleep on this side of the bed,

137
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,301
好吗
all right?

138
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,289
真是个小人精
You little snake.

139
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,003
搞不懂怎么会老上你的当
I don't know why I keep falling for the same old trick.

140
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,415
真会骗人  
You have your tricks, don't you?

141
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:11,830
快睡觉  快睡觉
Hey, go to sleep. Go to sleep.

142
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,004
-但是山姆是你朋友  是吗  -午饭时间不算
- But Sam is your friend, right? - Not at lunch.

143
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,041
-为啥  他偷你吃的吗  -没
- Why, does he steal your food? - No.

144
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,877
-他说妈妈的坏话?  -是
- Did he say something mean? About Mom? - Yeah.

145
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,556
-你揍他没  -是
- Did you hit him? - Yeah.

146
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,058
好  在哪儿揍的 
Good. Where'd you hit him?

147
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,856
在操场上
On the playground.

148
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,259
那一定很痛
Wow! That must have hurt.

149
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,393
站那别动  孩子
Hold it there, son.

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,176
玩具而已
It's a toy.

151
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,918
谢谢
Thank you.

152
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,184
好的
Hey. All right.

153
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,260
伸另一只胳膊
And the other arm.

154
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,356
别担心小汽车  过后会还我们  明白吗
Don't worry about the car. We'll get it back later, okay?

155
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,108
还好吧
Hey!

156
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,630
你好吗  宝贝儿
Hi, honey!

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,999
不想给妈咪一个亲亲吗
You won't give Mommy a kiss?

158
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,638
妈求你给我个亲亲好吗
Can Mommy please have a kiss?

159
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,039
小坏蛋  给妈咪一个亲亲
Rat-bag. Give your mom a kiss.

160
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,175
-爸爸给你读我的信吗  -每天睡觉前
- Is Daddy reading you my letters? - Every night at bedtime.

161
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,443
是吗
Yeah?

162
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,054
你真好闻
You smell so good.

163
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,988
你今天要搭什么啊
What are you gonna build today?

164
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,886
是碉堡吗
You gonna build a fort?

165
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,333
有门  是城堡吗
A door? Or a castle?

166
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,017
他害怕上学吗
Was he scared going to school?

167
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,297
不  我送他进教室
No. I walked him to his class,

168
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:57,521
亲一下  他就直接进去了
gave him a kiss, he just walked right in.

169
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,148
也不回头挥挥手
Didn't even turn back for a wave.

170
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,865
看看他的朋友们
Look at his friends!  

171
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,533
还有他的课桌
And his desk.

172
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,541
-你的第一天过得如何  -好极了
- How was your first day? - Excellent.

173
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,884
班上一半人还醒着  你知道
Half the class stayed awake, you know.

174
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,820
-我和你妈谈过了  -她什么时候来看我
- I talked to your mom. - When is she coming?

175
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:37,318
她生意遇到了大麻烦  所以
She's having a lot of trouble with her business, so...

176
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,394
没事  这才两年多
Well, it's only been a couple of years,

177
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:43,361
我想她会找时间来看我的
I'm sure she'll get around to it.

178
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,273
有什么消息吗
Have you heard anything?

179
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,241
上诉的事吗
About the appeal?

180
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,311
是  我刚决定不要告诉你
Yeah, and I've just decided not to tell you.

181
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,870
-记住迈耶说的话  -没用
- Remember what Meyer said. - Don't.

182
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,007
等法庭判决要花几个月时间
It can take months for a court to make a ruling.

183
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,974
我看见那女人了  就在那儿
I saw that woman. She was there.

184
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:03,179
她不可能就这么消失了啊
She couldn't have just disappeared.

185
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,756
迈耶在找新的调查员
Meyer is looking for a new investigator.

186
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,792
她的大衣勾住了我的包  我感到扣子掉了
Her coat snagged my purse, and I felt that button pop,

187
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,417
除非他们瞎了才找不出来
and they're blind if they can't find it.

188
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,497
他会把所有证据再理一遍的
He's gonna go through all the evidence again.

189
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,595
妙极了  我们还没给折腾的破产
That's great, because we're not quite bankrupt yet.

190
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,260
还不错
We're fine.

191
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,265
说瞎话不打草稿是吧
How you just lie and lie.

192
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,510
但是帅气逼人
But you're so handsome.

193
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,045
能帮我个忙吗
Can you do me a favor?

194
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,278
不知道  我很忙
I don't know, I'm kind of busy.

195
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,884
我要你去竞选州长
I need you to run for governor.

196
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,216
没问题
I can do that.

197
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,554
那时就能改一下无性爱的夫妻探视
You can change this rule about no conjugal visits,

198
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,755
因为我可能坚持不了二十年
'cause I don't think I can last another 20 years.

199
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,800
我没事
I'm okay.

200
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,875
-我没事  -一切都会好起来的
- I'm okay. - Everything is gonna be all right.

201
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,235
我保证
I promise.

202
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,847
你想他还会再亲我吗
You think he'll ever kiss me again?

203
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,833
起来
I need you to stand up.

204
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,343
抓到你了
Tag, you're it.

205
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,119
抓到你了
Tag, you're it.

206
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,192
卢克  该走了  小呆瓜
Luke! Let's go, yard ape.

207
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,830
-好玩吗  -是
- Have fun? - Yeah.

208
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,910
是个疯丫头  不是吗
She's kind of crazy, that little girl, right?

209
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,875
-该走了啊  凯莉  -不
- Time to go, Carrie! - No!

210
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,850
他一半时间看都没看  
He didn't even read the thing. Half the time,

211
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,976
我跟你讲   我们会把他送进去的
I'm telling you... We'll get him in there.

212
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,703
如果我们找到那个
What happens if we find the woman

213
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,256
在停车场的女人会怎么样
who was leaving the parking lot?

214
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,227
定罪救济的上诉被驳回了
The PCRA has been rejected.

215
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,996
没有新证据可以上交了  没有了
No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore.

216
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,129
这明明是抢劫案
It was a robbery.

217
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,961
如果有人刷过她的信用卡
And if they had used her credit card,

218
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:17,265
我们还可以争取一下
we could have argued that.

219
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,037
我   我很遗憾
I'm... I'm sorry.

220
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,309
约翰
John...

221
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,738
这事儿很操蛋
This sucks.

222
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,243
就算那样
Okay. That's that.

223
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,691
现在只有最高法院了  是吗
All we have now is the Supreme Court, right?

224
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,589
约翰  过去三十年
John, in the last 30 years,

225
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,164
最高法院从没有审过一桩谋杀案
the Supreme Court has not heard one murder case.

226
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,294
没有哪个象样的律师会递这种诉状
No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.

227
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,818
那就  找个不象样的律师
So, all I have to do is find an indecent one?

228
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:52,673
那应该不会很难
That shouldn't be too hard.

229
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,406
我去递状子
I'll file it.

230
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,945
但是我要你帮我做件事
But I need you to do something for me.

231
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,848
说
What?

232
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,732
你查看一下证据
I need you to look at the evidence

233
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:09,283
忘了劳拉是你妻子
and forget that Lara's your wife.

234
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,928
我已经看过证据了  迈耶
I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

235
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,562
我不是叫你判她有罪或无罪
I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty,

236
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:17,230
是叫你不带任何感情色彩地去看
I'm just saying look at it.

237
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,601
同事看到她离开现场
Her co-worker sees her leaving the scene,

238
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,562
她的衣服上有死者的血迹
the victim's blood is on her clothes,

239
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:25,768
凶器上有她的指纹
her fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

240
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,902
然后我们再去赴宴
And then we went out to dinner.

241
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,879
如果你杀了人你会那么做吗
How do you do that if you just killed somebody?

242
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,074
她不就成了心理变态了吗
That would make her a psychopath.

243
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,980
-那吵架的事  -劳拉是变态吗
- And the fight... - Is Lara a psychopath?

244
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:33,955
在办公室里吵架吗
The fight in the office?

245
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:35,212
每个人都和上司吵过架
Everyone fights with their boss!

246
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,413
但这个人最后死了
But this one ended up dead.

247
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,510
你的意思是说
So what you're saying is

248
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:41,991
你从来不相信她是无辜的
that you never believed in her innocence?

249
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,925
-你怎能那么说  -那你什么意思  迈耶
- How can you say that? - What are you saying, Meyer?

250
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,055
我意思是我们再怎么相信她
I'm saying that it no longer matters what we believe,

251
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,498
她也不会被放出来
Lara is not getting out!

252
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,738
你完全想不到我多么恨自己说这种话
And you have no idea how much I hate to say that.

253
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,707
那我找别人递诉状好了
I will find someone to file the pleadings.

254
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,786
约翰
John.

255
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,178
约翰  别这样  约翰
John, come on. John!

256
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,716
约翰
John!

257
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,817
约翰  看在老天的份上
John! For Christ's sakes!

258
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,053
来吧
Come on.

259
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,182
我们去找斯考特  好吧
We'll find Scout, okay?

260
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,140
谢谢
Thank you.

261
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,263
过来拥抱一下企鹅  
"And give a big hug to Penguin,

262
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:31,891
小企鹅  琪琪和负鼠
Little Penguin, Kiki and Opossumy.

263
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,825
好多好多爱  妈咪
"Lots and lots of love, Mommy."

264
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,064
我们给她回信吗
Should we write her back?

265
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,196
我要那些硬币
Can I have a quarter?

266
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,334
你要硬币
Can you have a quarter?

267
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,940
可是你可不能花掉这些钱
Yeah, but you know you can't spend these.

268
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,329
因为他们是从以前
Because they come from the cottage 

269
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,574
爸妈生你的时候的小屋里拿来的
where Mom and I used to take you

270
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,482
当时你还是婴儿
when you were a baby.

271
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:00,418
-现在都是我的吧  -当然
- Then can I have them all? - Sure.

272
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,475
我妻子  劳拉・布伦南  她被送这儿来了
My wife, Lara Brennan, she was sent up here.

273
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:29,042
-布伦南  B-R-E-N-N-A-N  -抱歉  她还不能见客
- Brennan, B-R-E-N-N-A-N. - I'm sorry, but she can't have visitors.

274
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,416
扯淡  我必须见她
That's ridiculous. I have to see her.

275
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,955
-劳拉  劳拉  -对不起
- Lara! Lara! - I'm sorry.

276
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,024
你不能去那儿
You can't go down there!

277
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,926
-你不能待在这儿  -站住  站那别动
- You can't be in here! - Hey, hey, stop. Stop right there.

278
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,325
-你去哪儿  给我回来  -劳拉
- Where you going? Hey, come back here. - Lara!

279
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,919
-劳拉  -先生
- Lara! - Sir!

280
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,726
-怎么回事  -我妻子企图自杀
- What the hell is going on? - My wife attempted suicide.

281
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,265
她被送到这儿来了  我必须见她  求你了
They brought her up here. I have to see her, please.

282
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,232
-她暂时不让见客  -那为什么不在急诊室
- She's not allowed visitors. - So why isn't she in the ER?

283
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,849
因为她从县监狱里转进来的
Because she's a transfer from County Jail.

284
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,237
就两分钟  好吗
Just two minutes, please.

285
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,666
两分钟
Two minutes.

286
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,173
好吧
Okay.

287
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,016
谢谢你
Thank you.

288
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,291
两分钟
Two minutes.

289
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,993
那么  堂吉诃德的生平与时代
So, The Life and Times of Don Quixote.

290
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,899
讲的什么
What is it about?

291
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,139
一个人对美德的追求
That someone's belief in virtue

292
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:57,144
远比美德本身更可贵吗
is more important than virtue itself?

293
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,077
书里都有  但到底讲的什么呢
Yes, that's in there. But what is it about?

294
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:08,404
讲的是理性怎样璀残你的灵魂吗
Could it be about how rational thought destroys your soul?

295
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,216
还是非理性的巨大成功
Could it be about the triumph of irrationality

296
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:14,719
本身就产生了力量
and the power that's in that?

297
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,720
我们花了太多时间去整理这个世界
You know, we spend a lot of time trying to organize the world.

298
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,823
我们发明了钟表和日历又去预测天气
We build clocks and calendars and we try and predict the weather.

299
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:29,437
然而什么才是我们真正能控制得了的呢
But what part of our life is truly under our control?

300
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,293
如果我们在自己一手制造的
What if we choose to exist purely

301
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:48,890
现实中选择了清白
in a reality of our own making?

302
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,888
这会使我们变成异类吗
Does that render us insane?

303
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,903
如果是  是否比绝望的生活更好
And if it does, isn't that better than a life of despair?

304
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:07,903
翻越囹圄

305
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,631
这门课程是研究
It's a course that investigates what

306
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:18,088
人类为何追求自由  
drives men to be free, 

307
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,253
无论付出多少代价
no matter the cost.

308
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,323
其他老师赌狗吗
Some other teacher had dibs on Papillon?

309
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:28,456
你成功越狱了七次
You escaped from jail seven times.

310
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,331
你想知道些什么呢
What do you want to know?

311
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,870
你是怎么做到别人之所不能的
How you escaped when no one else could.

312
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,167
胆量和一点儿运气
Balls and a little luck.

313
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,499
世上没有无懈可击的监狱
No prison in the world is airtight.

314
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,272
每个都有一把金钥匙  就看你怎么找了
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

315
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,878
你怎么找的
How do you do that?

316
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,140
多多观察罢了
A lot of looking.

317
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,519
尤其得注意那些比较反常的事情
Especially at things that break up the daily routine.

318
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,554
看守们每天重复着同样的事浑然不觉
Guards get comfortable doing the same thing day in, day out.

319
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,251
一旦发生事情  就是他们犯错误了
Something happens, that's when they make mistakes.

320
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,158
你发现的话  就要准备了
When you see it, you have to be ready.

321
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,697
你必须有一个全盘计划
You have to have the entire plan already in place,

322
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,666
即使你事前对越狱一窍不通
even before you know how you're going to get out of jail.

323
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,862
越狱不难  难的是如何保住自由之身
Escaping is easy, the hardest part is staying free.

324
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,927
你必须明确目的地
You have to know where you're gonna go

325
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:11,799
和如何去
and how you're gonna get there.

326
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,762
你也必须清楚他们怎么
You have to know how they plan

327
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,676
去抓你  何时何地
to catch you, where and when.

328
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,611
我怎么可能知道那些事
Well, how the hell are you supposed to know that?

329
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,776
花点钱问问知道的人
You pay off someone who knows.

330
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,711
此外监狱在乡下还是城里
And a lot depends on if the prison 

331
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:23,650
也不容忽视
is in the country or the city.

332
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,813
城里
City.

333
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,327
哪儿
Where are you from?

334
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,836
匹兹堡
Pittsburgh.

335
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,003
很难啊
Pittsburgh's tough.

336
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:50,072
很多桥梁和隧道都会被封
So many bridges and tunnels they can block off.

337
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,543
他们一声令下
From the time they make the call,

338
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,925
警察会在十五分钟之内
the police can have the center of the city

339
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:56,644
把市中心封锁起来
sealed tight in 15 minutes.

340
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,222
他们怎么会那么准时
How can they be so exact?

341
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,972
911之后  国土安全局
After 911, Homeland Security

342
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:01,759
制定了所有城市的封锁计划
made every city have a lockdown plan.

343
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,118
匹兹堡市中心  费城
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly,

344
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:06,353
波士顿  明尼阿波利斯  十五分钟内关闭
Boston, Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

345
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,663
华盛顿能缩小到十分钟之内
They can do D.C. In under 10.

346
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,791
三十五分钟内  州际边界的每个检查站
Within 35 minutes, they can have cops

347
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:12,863
都会布满警察
at every tollbooth on the interstate

348
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,735
二级公路上变成了流动的检查站
and be running rolling stops on the secondary roads.

349
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,124
即使没有你的大头照
They won't have your photograph yet,

350
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,468
他们也会知道你的长相
but they will have your description.

351
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:20,893
你跑不了怎么办
What if you can't get out?

352
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:22,574
三十五分钟可不长啊
Thirty-five minutes is not a lot of time.

353
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,670
那就投降好了
Then surrender.

354
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,000
因为他们当场就会将你们击毙
Because they will shoot you on sight,

355
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,219
一个也不留
along with anyone else you're with.

356
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,185
别去火车和汽车站
Stay far away from the train and bus stations.

357
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,985
别去本地机场  到其它州起飞
Forget the local airports. Leave from another state.

358
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,886
第二  身份  弄份假证件容易
Second, identity. It's easy to find fake papers,

359
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,726
混过机场安检很难
harder to find ones that will get you through an airport.

360
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,350
你需要一本护照  驾驶证
You'll need a passport, a driver's license

361
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,269
一个社保号
and a social security number.

362
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,615
如果你必须租车
If you have to rent a car,

363
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:48,771
找个能存钱的地方
find a place that will take a cash deposit.

364
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,920
他们会不断查你的信用卡
They'll still run a credit check,

365
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:53,239
所以要找一个真名做身份
so use a real person's name on the ID.

366
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,972
第三  目的地
Third, destination.

367
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,785
你要找一个
You want somewhere

368
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:57,139
美国游客不多的地方
that doesn't attract American tourists.

369
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,841
也门可以考虑下
Think Yemen, and you get the idea.

370
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,117
还有钱  你需要很多钱
And money, you'll need a truckload of it.

371
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,680
到处都烧钱  住店  交通  个人信息
Everything's expensive, hotels, travel, information.

372
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,550
多少
How much?

373
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,891
至少能坚持五六年
Enough to last at least five, six years.

374
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,130
钱越少  朋友也越少
You run out of money, you run out of friends.

375
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,468
不过做任何事之前
But before you do anything,

376
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:23,163
得问问自己是否有能力做这件事
you have to ask yourself if you can do it.

377
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,304
你能忘记父母之情吗
Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again?

378
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:30,142
你能下手杀掉看守吗  把小孩留在加油站
Can you kill a guard? Leave your kid at a gas station?

379
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,482
把好心的老大娘推开
Push some nice old lady to the ground

380
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,609
只是因为她挡了你的路
just because she gets between you and the door?

381
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,348
要做这些事  你就得变成这样
Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become.

382
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,289
如果你做不了  就别做
And if you can't, don't start,

383
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,259
因为这会害死人
'cause you'll just get someone killed.

384
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,099
你怎么会被抓的
How did you get caught?

385
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,065
我自己投降了
I gave myself up.

386
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,853
当有人想穿门而入时
I couldn't take wondering when someone

387
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:00,374
我没有坚持住
was gonna come through the bedroom door.

388
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,544
你口袋里有什么
So, what do you have in your pocket?

389
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,093
祝你好运
Good luck.

390
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,092
最后三个月

391
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,692
世上没有无懈可击的监狱
No prison in the world is airtight.

392
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,102
每个都有一把金钥匙  就看你怎么找了
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

393
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,868
你是怎么做的
How do you do that?

394
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,204
多多观察
A lot of looking.

395
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,108
尤其得注意那些比较反常的事情
Especially at things that break up the daily routine.

396
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,080
左边是阿勒格尼郡立监狱
And on the left, the Allegheny County Jail,

397
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:57,758
是目前全球最大的监狱
now the largest jail in the world.

398
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,068
这里曾有过三次越狱行动
There have been three escape

399
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:01,093
每次均已失败告终
attempts of which no one has made it out alive.

400
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,190
请看右边  南边方向
If you look to the right, south side...

401
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,270
第一次登陆时
"On the first landing, which was

402
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,867
登陆点极其狭窄
as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed."

403
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,499
柱子里头有一个大约一码宽的神龛
"There was a niche in the column, about half a yard wide."

404
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,714
在神龛里面
"And in this niche, the

405
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:16,068
王子确切地感受到一个隐秘的男人
prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed."

406
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,911
他觉得自己可以辨别出一个人就站在那儿

00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,505

好像一年前吧
I guess about a year ago.

491
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,718
一年前

Look at you. How can you do this to yourself?

493
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,135
没老婆再身边  我什么都干不了

494

甚至自行车都骑不好

514
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,175
你好  布伦南先生
Hey, Mr. Brennan.

515
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,857
今天我要为大家演示下
Today I'm gonna show you

516
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:47,254
如何制作一把万能钥匙
how to make a key that can open any lock.

517
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,019
即撞匙
It's called a bump key.

518
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,420
首先你需要找到一把钥匙
First thing you need to do is you need to find a key

519
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,088
一把与你想要打开的锁相匹配的钥匙
that can fit into the type of lock that you're trying to open.

520
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,564
这里有一把与我家大门相配的钥匙
Here I have a key that fits into my front door,

521
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,501
不过我更换了锁芯  所以用这个打不开了
but I just changed the locks, so it won't open.

522
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,232
首先缚住你的钥匙
First thing you need to do is secure your key,

523
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,217
用一根锉子顺着钥匙下去
take a metal file and go through

524
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:07,800
把那些锁齿磨平
and start taking those mountains and valleys

525
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,471
磨至最深
all the way down to the lowest possible setting on the key.

526
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,106
撞匙的工作原理是让那些弹针在某一刻弹起
The bump key works by momentarily bumping those pins up,

527
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,309
这样在那一刻
so that for a split second,

528
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,682
锁腔暂时没有弹针阻扰  
the chamber is cleared of pins and thus, 

529
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:18,946
就可以转动钥匙打开门了
able to turn and open.

530
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,278
-给你  -别乱碰
- Here you go. - Don't touch that.

531
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,509
-抱歉  -想接替我吗
- Sorry. - Trying to do my job?

532
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,845
哪个是你
So you are where in here?

533
00:44:48,154 --> 00:44:49,079
电梯一组

534
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,786
在中间
I'm in the middle there.

535
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,322
在中间  可以指给我看吗
In the middle. Can you point to yourself?

536
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:09,985
那个是我
That's me.

537
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,422
就在那
There.

538
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,293
电梯旁边那个不是你
So that's not you back there by the elevators.

539
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,562
不  不是  我在这边  靠近这里吧
No, no, I was around here somewhere.

540
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,634
能告诉我发生什么事了吗
You wanna tell me what's going on?

541
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,072
你还想让我告诉你
You want me to tell you?

542
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:33,842
嗯
Yes.

543
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,649
知道撞匙吗
Do you know what a bump key is?

544
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,949
什么
Sorry?

545
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,290
如果这是你干的
If this was you,

546
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,129
想想假如父母都进了监狱
you might wanna think about what's gonna happen to your kids

547
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,432
你的孩子该怎么办
if both their parents end up in prison.

548
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,931
爸
Dad?

549
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,835
爸
Dad!

550
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,474
我在这  宝贝
Yeah, bud.

551
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,109
谢了
Thanks.

552
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,507
我们逮捕了他的妻子
So we arrested his wife,

553
00:50:23,508 --> 00:50:26,547
这会又要控告这个呕吐的男人
and now we're gonna charge the man with vomiting.

554
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,489
他卖房子  或者他有买家了
He's selling the house. Or he has a buyer.

555
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,995
在这样的市场形势下?  幸运男
In this market? Lucky man.

556
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,894
现在办点警察该干的事吧
Can we possibly go do police work now?

557
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,834
真搞不懂这么久怎么你还是孤家寡人一个
I don't know how you managed to stay single this long.

558
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,315
爸  给我点甜饼好吗
Dad, can I have my cookies?

559
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,956
-饿了吗  要不要来份三明治  -不要
- You hungry? You want a sandwich? - No.

560
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,329
-给你  -谢啦
- There you go. - Thanks.

561
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,031
凯莉
Carrie!

562
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:20,040
抱歉  这孩子不太懂事
I'm sorry. She's just already got it all figured out.

563
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,640
我叫妮可
Nicole.

564
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,549
-记得  -是吗
- I remember. - Really?

565
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,914
我记得你女儿
I remember your daughter.

566
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,448
呵呵  她确实容易让人记住
Well, she's hard to forget.

567
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:47,059
卢克要把这个带回去的
Luke was supposed to bring this home.

568
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,297
他像他老爸一样健忘
He has his father's memory.

569
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,142
是凯莉的生日派对
It's for Carrie's birthday party.

570
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,506
一定要来哦  我很想见见你太太
Please, come. I'd love to meet your wife.

571
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,642
她不会去的
She won't be there.

572
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,777
很复杂
It's complicated.

573
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,615
我懂  我也是
I understand. With me, too.

574
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,148
凯莉  过来  得走了
Carrie, come on, let's go.

575
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,718
去吃点东西  一起吧
We're gonna grab a bite to eat. Would you like to come?

576
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,031
-不  还是算了  我们有点儿  -忙吗
- No, I don't... We're kind of... - Busy?

577
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,329
来吧  我们还欠你的甜饼呢
Come on. We owe you for the cookies.

578
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:25,899
这倒也是
Well, that's true.

579
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,377
而且是我亲手做的
And I did make those cookies myself.

580
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,469
而且还知道预先包装好
And learned how to pre-package them.

581
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,347
好吧  卢克
Come on, Luke.

582
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,759
你是抽出时间陪卢克的吗
So, do you trade off time with Luke?

583
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,522
不是  我们俩整天都在一起
No, Luke and I are together full-time.

584
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,758
难怪我能经常看到你
Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.

585
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,058
其实我太太最想过来陪他了
She'd like nothing better than to be here, with him.

586
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,368
劳拉她  她很想念这些
Lara, she... She misses all this.

587
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,271
被别的什么事缠住了  是吧
I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?

588
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,541
不  她不是那样的人
No, she's not like that.

589
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,448
她在监狱
She's in prison.

590
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,792
-对大多数人我都不讲这个  -理解
- I don't tell most people. - I understand.

591
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,623
她是无辜的  那个女人不是她杀的
She's innocent. She didn't kill that woman.

592
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,089
很好  我是说
Good. I mean...

593
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,198
我肯定她没有杀人
I'm sure she didn't.

594
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,304
我们真的得回去了
We really should be going home.

595
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,602
好的
Okay.

596
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,709
十分感谢你的邀请  我们会尽量赴约
Thank you very much for the invitation. We'll try and make it.

597
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,576
那样最好不过
That would be great.

598
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,008
-再见了  卢克  -拜
- Goodbye. Luke! - Bye.

599
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,180
过来
Come on.

600
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,387
凯莉  走了
Carrie, come on!

601
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,351
匹斯堡健康实验中心

602
00:54:27,502 --> 00:54:28,303
钥匙

603
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:34,922
搜索  糖尿病状况

604
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:40,097
高钾血症  糖尿病引发威胁病人生命的病症

605
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:41,809
如何进入一辆车不引发报警音

606
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:09,829
葡萄糖含量异常

607
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,298
怎么啦
What's wrong?

608
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,376
那是什么
What is it?

609
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:37,711
不
No.

610
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,279
不
No.

611
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,021
他们不能在毫无通知的情况下对你转监
They can't move you without notice.

612
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,117
才三天算什么预先告知
Three days isn't notice.

613
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,677
因为要处理上诉我才会留在这里
I was only here through the appeal.

614
00:57:47,678 --> 00:57:49,459
转监是迟早的事
We knew I was going to a prison.

615
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,733
不  不  我没两个礼拜的时间
No, no, I don't have two weeks.

616
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:55,733
最后3天

617
00:57:55,734 --> 00:57:57,667
明天我就得结束契约
I gotta close the escrow tomorrow.

618
00:57:57,397 --> 00:57:59,430
产权还没有分清呢
Well, the title hasn't even been cleared yet.

619
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:00,572
我没办法...
I mean, there's no way I can...

620
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:01,871
他们能给多少
How much can they give me?

621
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,402
什么都不会给
Nothing!

622
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,068
怎么这会来了
What are you doing here?

623
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:35,802
我有课
I've got class.

624
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,777
没事的
You be good, okay?

625
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:45,943
谢啦
Thanks.

626
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,196
银行

627
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:00,990
没事吧  伤到没
Are you okay? You're okay?

628
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,428
-你们没事吧  -搞什么
- Are you okay? - What are you doing?

629
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,692
差点撞死我们
You almost killed us!

630
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,858
抱歉  很抱歉
I'm so, so sorry.

631
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,697
想什么呢  都不看看
You're out of your mind. You don't look.

632
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,902
走开  走开
Get away. Get away from us!

633
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,432
嘿
Hey.

634
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,706
怎么啦
What's wrong?

635
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,782
没什么
Nothing.

636
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,548
是卢克吗
Is it Luke?

637
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,085
-不是  -那是什么
- No. - What?

638
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,615
我请迈耶
I... I asked Meyer

639
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,661
查看了一下不要把你转监的事情
to look into not having you moved.

640
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,187
我跟他说这么远的路途
I told him that traveling

641
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:12,624
对我们来说很困难
that distance would be a hardship on us,

642
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,794
事实上卢克在学校已经有些问题了  
that Luke was already having problems at school, which is true.

643
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,895
我没有花足够的时间去陪他
I haven't been spending enough time with him.

644
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:18,838
你没有吗
You haven't?

645
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,267
没
No.

646
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,643
你真没有吗
You haven't?

647
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,349
主啊  约翰
Jesus, John.

648
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,444
你想多了
You really are too much.

649
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:36,390
卢克难过  是因为妈妈谋杀罪入狱
Luke is having a hard time, because Mommy's in jail for murder,

650
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,859
而不是因为爸爸没有花时间去陪他
not because Daddy doesn't spend enough time with him.

651
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,476
你父亲是对的
Your father was right.

652
01:01:42,477 --> 01:01:44,592
你跟我们生活在不同的世界
You really don't live in the same world we do.

653
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,665
真好笑  你们两个都这么说
That's nice, that the two of you talk.

654
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,464
请问我生活在一个怎样的世界  劳拉
What world do I live in, Lara?

655
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,135
不知道  约翰  但肯定不是一个真实的世界
Well, I don't know, John, but it's not the real one.

656
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:56,197
而现在我待的世界
The one in which I'm in here for 

657
01:01:56,198 --> 01:01:57,508
是自己将度过余生的地方
the rest of my life.

658
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,827
所以别跟我讲
So don't be talking to me

659
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:01,208
那些让人开心的幻想 
about fantasies like there's some happily ever...

660
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,007
没什么问题吧
We good here?

661
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,683
抱歉
Yes. Sorry.

662
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,266
现在你拉长个脸在这儿  
Now you're gonna sit here all long-faced, 

663
01:02:22,336 --> 01:02:23,266
想让我不好受是吧
like you let me down.

664
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,845
想让我怎么样
I mean, what do you want me to do here?

665
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:26,205
想让我使你好受点吗
You want me to make you feel better?

666
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,503
明白
Got it.

667
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:29,809
抱歉
I'm sorry.

668
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,470
又来道歉
Now you're apologizing.

669
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,515
你可真是个活宝
You really are a gem.

670
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:34,858
到底想我怎样  劳拉
What do you want from me, Lara?

671
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:36,744
就你啊  什么都不想
What do I want from you? Nothing.

672
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,548
你已经太完美了
You're already too perfect.

673
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,684
你都没有问过到底是不是我干的
You know, you never even asked me if I did it.

674
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,822
-我有没有杀她  -因为我相信你没有
- If I killed her. - Because I know you didn't.

675
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,952
是吗  不过你错了
Well, then you'd be wrong.

676
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,443
这边好了
I'm done.

677
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,041
先生  你不能站在那里
Sir, you can't stand there.

678
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,650
先生  现在请您离开这里
Sir, I need you to leave the building now.

679
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:45,479
先生
Sir?

680
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,464
-搞什么又  -闭嘴
- What? - Shut up.

681
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:09,139
我不在乎你说的什么或者你说话的方式
I don't care what you say or how you say it.

682
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,471
我就不相信是你干的
I don't believe you did it.

683
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,978
绝不相信
And I never will.

684
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,389
我知道你的为人
I know who you are.

685
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,795
我向你承诺
