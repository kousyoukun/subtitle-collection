1
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,413
That's it?

2
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,750
Yes, that's King Ghidorah.

3
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:26,504
It's gigantic, and it's got two heads.

4
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,299
Well, originally it had three.

5
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,592
Three?

6
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,888
He lost one when he fought Godzilla.

7
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,558
You mean King Ghidorah fought Godzilla?

8
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,520
Yes, in the 20th century.

9
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,368
UFO presence in Tokyo?

10
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,581
Was the Mysterious Light a UFO?

11
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,752
<i>Are you awake?</i>

12
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,963
Yeah. For a while.

13
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,756
<i>Did you see the UFO last night?</i>

14
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,760
No, I went to bed early.

15
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,890
Though I did manage
to read through the paper this morning.

16
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,559
<i>Looks like it was real this time.</i>

17
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,519
<i>Even for the skeptical press,</i>

18
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,521
<i>they can't seem to explain it otherwise.</i>

19
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,190
I guess you're right.

20
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,152
<i>This story is going to be in our next issue.</i>

21
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,904
<i>Will you write something for us?</i>

22
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,532
Hey, go ask Yaoi.

23
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,578
I told you I'm fed up
writing about mainstream opinions.

24
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,457
I've changed my ways
and from this point on,

25
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,376
I'll only write non-fiction,
human-based topics.

26
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,630
That's funny, coming from someone
who wrote a book about psychics.

27
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,381
Be quiet.

28
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,967
I'll tell you what.

29
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,137
I'm interested in that old man
that lives in Hakata.

30
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,430
Where?

31
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,390
That article about Dinosaur World.

32
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,851
Man objects to dinosaur exhibit
at Fukuoka Dinosaur World

33
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,146
A long time ago, I saw a real-life dinosaur.

34
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,818
You don't know what it was like,

35
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,614
but I certainly do!

36
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,076
That dinosaur

37
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:06,538
is always watching us from somewhere.

38
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,045
And if we ever become helpless
and desperate...

39
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,048
Right when we're about to be broken,

40
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,717
the dinosaur will always come.

41
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,386
A warning to the humans
who desecrate the dinosaur

42
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,595
The dinosaurs are sacred

43
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,888
Hear the voice of the dinosaur

44
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:27,351
I encountered it
on the doomed battlefront of the War.

45
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,314
So, now, is our country safe?

46
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,444
Our country seems peaceful, and you think
nothing could possibly happen to us.

47
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,114
- But we've lost our will to live.
- Let's go. You're disturbing the peace.

48
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,699
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

49
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,076
Listen to your heart!

50
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,664
Lagos Island?

51
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,457
That's right. It's a small island

52
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,878
between two larger islands called Luol
and Kwajalein, in the South Pacific.

53
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,549
You saw a living dinosaur
on that island, huh?

54
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,636
When our troops were stationed
over on Lagos Island,

55
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,556
a lot of the soldiers in my garrison saw it.

56
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,058
It protected us.

57
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,935
It saved us from the U.S. forces

58
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,396
that were attacking our troops in that region.

59
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,274
It protected you?

60
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,819
It was February, 1944.

61
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,405
<i>The Luol and Kwajalein garrisons</i>

62
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,033
<i>were all under heavy attack
from the American Navy,</i>

63
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,243
<i>and they were completely annihilated.</i>

64
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:33,417
<i>But only our garrison
on the small island of Lagos survived.</i>

65
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,089
So what you're saying

66
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,550
is that the dinosaur repelled the Americans?

67
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,053
Yeah, that's right.

68
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,679
Unbelievable.

69
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,265
But Why? Why did it do that?

70
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,353
I think perhaps it wasn't really protecting us,

71
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,272
but that it was only trying
to protect its own territory.

72
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,525
The dinosaur was very gentle at first.

73
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,237
But later, it went completely wild.

74
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,410
It went wild?

75
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,621
The Americans were so scared
with what they saw,

76
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,540
they retreated with their tails
between their legs.

77
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,381
Later, the High Command
saw that we hadn't surrendered

78
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,592
and gave orders to evacuate us in a hurry.

79
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,554
We thought we would never see
our homeland ever again.

80
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,723
But thanks to that dinosaur,

81
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,642
we were able to return to Japan.

82
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,146
But there's no one who...

83
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,860
Well, is there a record
of what happened in Lagos?

84
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,030
No, there isn't.

85
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,661
Every one of the other garrisons

86
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,038
fought to the death.

87
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,124
Yet we were on this small island
that was close by.

88
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,710
How could the surviving soldiers
leave a record about coming back?

89
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,340
The S.S. Takatsuki
had recorded with its radar,

90
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,634
this flight path of the UFO from last night.

91
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,806
The UFO then disappeared from radar
detection as it passed over Mount Fuji.

92
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,019
As it traveled southwest,
its movements were clearly recorded.

93
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,314
This is the first time our radar systems

94
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,651
have been able to trace
the entire path of the UFO.

95
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,448
Now, take a look at this.

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,661
We can tell from looking
at these satellite pictures

97
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,124
that it was neither an aircraft nor a meteorite.

98
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,001
A UFO?

99
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,171
That is, there's just no other explanation.

100
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,424
There is yet another interesting report

101
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,342
from the Paranormal Research Center.

102
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,262
This is from Miki Saegusa
of the Godzilla team.

103
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,225
<i>This is Saegusa.</i>

104
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,978
<i>There's something I'd like to show you
in the satellite photographs.</i>

105
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,063
<i>Please watch your screen carefully.</i>

106
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,777
<i>This image here is where
Godzilla rests in the Sea of Japan,</i>

107
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,529
<i>driven there by Biollante.</i>

108
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,575
<i>That is where he's been lying all this time.</i>

109
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,536
<i>All of these years,
he's been kept alive and unabated</i>

110
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,538
<i>by anti-nuclear bacteria.</i>

111
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,083
<i>But just yesterday, we found something new,</i>

112
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,294
<i>here in the latest satellite photo.</i>

113
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,965
- What is that?
- They've become a singular body.

114
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,176
- A singular body.
- This is news.

115
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,720
We analyzed the image very closely.

116
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,890
It's the same UFO that flew in yesterday.

117
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,476
What does that mean?

118
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,479
Are you saying that the UFO and Godzilla
are related somehow?

119
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,608
No, we still don't know
what that object is yet.

120
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,070
<i>So we can't conclude anything.</i>

121
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,572
Department of Engineering
Science Research Center

122
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,211
Those bones that were caught
by the Japanese fishing boat

123
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,755
look to me like they are from a Plesiosaur.

124
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,298
A Loch Ness in the South Pacific?

125
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,718
A Plesiosaur

126
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,429
just off of New Zealand in 1977?

127
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,309
All scientists say dinosaurs are extinct,

128
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,311
but I don't agree.

129
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,896
Doubts on the extinction of dinosaurs

130
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,065
So what you're saying is...

131
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,151
I would believe that old man's story.

132
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:32,239
That thing may not have been
a Tyrannosaurus Rex,

133
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,700
but in 1944, there was a dinosaur

134
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,618
on the Marshall Islands.

135
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,162
If it's true that there was a dinosaur,

136
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,457
does that mean you'll go
to the island of Lagos to try to find it?

137
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,003
No, I won't go because
in my opinion, it's not there anymore.

138
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,964
Not there anymore?

139
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,508
Well, then, what are you going to do?

140
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,053
Hydrogen bomb test site
at Marshall Islands

141
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,638
The H-bomb tests?

142
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,519
Tested on Lagos in 1954.

143
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,148
So the dinosaur was hit
by massive radioactivity.

144
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,524
And after that,

145
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,945
the dinosaur turned into Godzilla.

146
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,953
What's that?

147
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,497
<i>Unit two, copy that. What is that?</i>

148
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>Move in closer, we'll check it out.</i>

149
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,168
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

150
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,302
<i>What happened, Unit two? Respond!</i>

151
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,892
We've just arrived at the scene.

152
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,352
We'll start investigating right away.

153
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,480
Hey, what's that?

154
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,732
What? What do you see?

155
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,749
<i>Two army helicopters on a routine patrol</i>

156
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,418
<i>disappeared without a trace
near Mount Fuji last night.</i>

157
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,505
<i>And some say it could have been
the unexplained UFO</i>

158
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,256
<i>that was responsible for the disappearance</i>

159
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,009
<i>and possible destruction
of the army helicopters.</i>

160
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:20,263
<i>We have here Mr. Yaoi,
a UFO expert, to speak with us.</i>

161
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,433
<i>Thank you for coming, Mr. Yaoi.
Please tell us what you think.</i>

162
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,019
<i>Good morning.
Well, there have been many instances</i>

163
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,146
<i>where army aircraft have disappeared</i>

164
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,274
<i>upon approaching UFOs.</i>

165
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:36,405
<i>For example, on November 16, 1988...</i>

166
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:42,077
I hope you don't want me to write
about some space battle now, huh?

167
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,623
What's that? Yasuaki Shindo?

168
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,961
Of course I know him.
He's the head of the Teiyo Group.

169
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,881
Besides that,
he's the man who owns Dinosaur World.

170
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,594
So what about him?

171
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,350
He was on Lagos?

172
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,769
Yes, he was Major Shindo back then,

173
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,896
commander of the Lagos garrison.

174
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,484
So, then, Mr. Shindo would know
about the dinosaur as well.

175
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,115
What, a real dinosaur?

176
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,663
Young man,

177
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,501
I do call myself an expert
in dinosaur studies,

178
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,297
but I'm sorry to tell you
I've never seen a live one.

179
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,008
Are you saying not even on Lagos Island?

180
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,512
On Lagos?

181
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,725
I believe that there was
a dinosaur on Lagos Island in 1944.

182
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,441
Mr. Shindo.

183
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,528
I have to go to Kyushu
for a meeting right now.

184
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,448
I've wasted my precious time here.

185
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,576
Ten years ago, after you left Lagos,

186
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,454
an H-bomb was tested
on a nearby island called Bikini.

187
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,375
And it's very possible that
the radioactivity turned it into Godzilla.

188
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,171
That's what I believe, anyway.

189
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,884
You mean that the dinosaur
turned into Godzilla?

190
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:33,730
Its head is smaller than that
of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

191
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,110
Look closely at the face.
The eyes and mouth.

192
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,822
Also the hands and fingers.

193
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,782
So rather than a Tyrannosaurus...

194
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,622
Rather, its characteristics
are close to Godzilla.

195
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,584
And these pictures here belong to Shindo?

196
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,086
That's right.

197
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,422
No one besides the three of us
has ever seen the pictures.

198
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,179
So then it was the dinosaur
that saved the very men

199
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,392
who rebuilt our economy and country.

200
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,136
We've come to Japan to talk.
Your weapons are futile.

201
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,889
Our first meeting will be today
at 13:00.

202
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,640
Is this message from them?

203
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,559
Yes, we received it around 10:00 a.m.

204
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,603
It suddenly appeared on this monitor.

205
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,566
Do you think they will show themselves?

206
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,820
Something's happening with the UFO.

207
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,332
Move out!

208
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,754
Come on! Move it! Move it!

209
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,608
My name is Dobashi.
I'm head of the Security Agency.

210
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,862
I'm Fujio. I'm a physicist
at the Paranormal Research Center.

211
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,532
I'm Wilson. It's nice to meet you.

212
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,660
I'm Glenchico.

213
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,412
Emmy Kano. I'm Japanese.

214
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,792
Please forgive us, we can't shake hands.

215
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,460
Why is that?

216
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,337
Because we're still inside the ship.

217
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,923
What you see is a hologram projection of us.

218
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,351
A hologram?

219
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,985
That's correct. We're a 3D projection,

220
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,987
invented in the 21st century.

221
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,446
The 21st century?

222
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,033
We've traveled back in time
from the 23rd century.

223
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,161
2204, if you wish to be exact.

224
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,747
We are from the Earth Union.

225
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,959
So the UFO is...

226
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,546
Men of your time
would call our ship a time machine.

227
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,298
But not us, we call it our mother ship.

228
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,592
So this ship is a time machine?

229
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,637
Yes, it was invented 200 years from now.

230
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,723
Near the beginning of the 22nd century.

231
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,100
How is that possible?

232
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,813
I understand. You're from the 23rd century.

233
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,607
So then what do you want?

234
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,736
First off, tomorrow morning,

235
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,280
we'd like to have a meeting
with your country's Prime Minister,

236
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,325
and we hope that you two
will help arrange it for us.

237
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,955
Yes, we will.

238
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,834
But tell me, how would you want us
to take the three of you to him?

239
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,004
Please, sir, just tell us
where your Prime Minister will be,

240
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,214
we assure you we'll show up at that place.

241
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,887
Teleportation.

242
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,516
They are clearly not from the 20th century.

243
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,436
Using the Earth Union's time machine,

244
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,814
we've been sent back here to warn you all.

245
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,192
We wish to change incidents
that are about to take place here.

246
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,404
Things that have caused
catastrophy in the 23rd century.

247
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,824
We came here to warn you all

248
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,118
about your country's gloomy future.

249
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,162
In the century that we come from,
there's no longer a Japan.

250
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,832
How could that possibly be, and why?

251
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,333
What's the reason for it?

252
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,336
It's all a result of nuclear pollution.

253
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,799
In the 21st century,
Godzilla will return to Japan

254
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,926
and bring forth its demise.

255
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,012
Of course, the land will be destroyed,

256
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,766
but the destruction will cause
radiation to spread.

257
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,351
And over time,

258
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,146
the radiation will spread over
the entire country

259
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:10,650
and your mother country will be
totally uninhabitable.

260
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,071
Can it be true? Would Godzilla do that to us?

261
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,698
It's unbelievable.

262
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,160
We have come here to save Japan

263
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,828
from the terrible tragedy it now faces.

264
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,373
Save us? How do you plan on saving us?

265
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,335
You must obliterate Godzilla.

266
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,379
Get rid of Godzilla?

267
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,506
We can't do that.

268
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,841
- Impossible.
- Yeah.

269
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,969
I have a book here.

270
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,392
Finally, I'm done!

271
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,775
Hello, this is Terasawa.

272
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,111
Yeah.

273
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,823
That's right.
I'm a writer of non-fiction stories.

274
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,617
Who's calling?

275
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,746
This is the Security Agency?

276
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,250
Now? The Prime Minister's Office now?

277
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,727
- They've asked you here, too?
- That's right.

278
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,979
I'm sorry to have invited
you gentlemen here so late.

279
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,231
Come, please follow me.

280
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:36,945
The Birth of Godzilla

281
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,781
But this is the book that I wrote.

282
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,660
I mean, it's the book
that I'm writing right now.

283
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,455
And it includes an introduction
by Professor Fujio.

284
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,791
Yes, that seems to be the case.

285
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,377
But...

286
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,630
How is it possible that you have
a book that I'm about to write?

287
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,092
You said that people from the distant future

288
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,593
brought this book?

289
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:01,678
That's right.

290
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:08,059
I find this very hard to believe.

291
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,106
Now, according to that book,

292
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,193
Godzilla is a dinosaur that's existed
since 1944 on Lagos Island.

293
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,571
It was exposed to radiation
from the H-bomb test in 1954

294
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,448
in the Bikini Atoll.

295
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,701
Which caused the dinosaur to be enlarged

296
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,744
and enraged.

297
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,456
They examined him in the sea,
where he is presently.

298
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,208
They've checked bones and cells

299
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,085
and entered this data into their computers

300
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,504
to check it against your theory.

301
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,840
So, how does my theory hold up?

302
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,052
There's a 98% chance
that all the facts are as you predicted.

303
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,639
So that means,

304
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:50,601
if the dinosaur hadn't been exposed
to radiation from the H-bomb test,

305
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,603
then Godzilla would not exist.

306
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,689
Yes, that's what they told us.

307
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,190
Furthermore,

308
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,736
Japan will be free
from the threat of Godzilla's wrath.

309
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,238
You don't mean...

310
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,700
They're going back in time?

311
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,745
They intend to use their time machine

312
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,457
and go back to 1944 at Lagos Island.

313
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,002
There, they will teleport the dinosaur
to another location.

314
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,344
Our history will no longer include Godzilla.

315
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,097
That was the request
of the men from the future.

316
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,600
It's fantastic.

317
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,727
Oh, no.

318
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,854
Don't be surprised yet.

319
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,230
They've come to us

320
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,817
in search of people
who will help them complete their task.

321
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,403
They have chosen three people.

322
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,365
<i>Terasawa, the writer of the book.</i>

323
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,660
<i>Mazaki, the dinosaur expert.</i>

324
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:55,375
<i>And Miki Saegusa, a member
of the Paranormal Research Center.</i>

325
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,002
<i>Advance to the center of the platform.</i>

326
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,363
<i>Turn left and proceed.</i>

327
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,047
This way.

328
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,597
Please be seated.

329
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,975
Sit down, please.

330
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:49,322
We thank you and the Japanese government
for helping us with our task.

331
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,867
We thank the three people

332
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,453
who will be joining us as well.

333
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,789
From our own people,

334
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,876
fellow Japanese Miss Emmy

335
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,421
and our Android model M-11 will be with you.

336
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,090
He's an android?

337
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,843
You mean this guy is a robot?

338
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,137
I am.

339
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,390
But he looks just like a man!

340
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,935
Yes, externally,
but actually he's much better.

341
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,521
His defensive ability, for example,
is far superior.

342
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:25,024
He's much more capable
than any human being could possibly be.

343
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,692
For this mission,

344
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:29,695
the details, security, everything

345
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,697
will be guaranteed if he is with you.

346
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,617
But there are other people
besides the three of us here

347
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,869
who know much more about the dinosaur.

348
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,831
Actually, there are some
who've even seen a dinosaur face-to-face

349
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,833
and have even lived to tell about it.

350
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,253
So why did you choose the three of us here?

351
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:49,090
The theory in time warp,
contrary to how it is in films,

352
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,883
is that two instances of a person

353
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,886
cannot exist at the same moment in time.

354
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,888
Therefore, if we send Mr. Shindo

355
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,515
back to the future,

356
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,934
one of him from 50 years ago

357
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,688
and the other from our present time
would exist at the same time.

358
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,773
Therefore,

359
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,276
one of the Mr. Shindos will disappear.

360
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,652
That's exactly right.

361
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,994
You mean I have to ride that?

362
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,788
Couldn't they pick somebody else?

363
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,751
Hey, Emmy,
I have a question about the future.

364
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,086
What is it?

365
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,548
Well, tell me now,
did my book become a bestseller?

366
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,593
Actually, hardly anyone
even knew about your book.

367
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,677
I see.

368
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,861
Sorry, did they scare you?

369
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,743
We call them dorats.

370
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,911
They're so cute.

371
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,622
<i>We will be leaving shortly.</i>

372
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:06,000
<i>Crew members,
please get to your stations immediately.</i>

373
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,799
They're a new kind of animal.

374
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,218
They're created through biotechnology.

375
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,514
They're achievements of the 23rd century.

376
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,600
They always know
how to behave around people.

377
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,478
They can sense our feelings
through microwave impulses.

378
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,313
Will they be coming along with us?

379
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,815
Yes, they will be very helpful to us
if we ever get lost

380
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,567
because they can always cheer us up.

381
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,779
Well, I sure hope that
doesn't happen to us this time.

382
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,905
I'm joking.

383
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,575
Prepare for takeoff.

384
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,250
Have we arrived?

385
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:58,631
A complete success.
It's the 6th of February, 1944, Lagos Island.

386
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,008
Really?

387
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:23,364
It looks like we really did travel back in time.

388
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,951
It seems we're right in the middle
of World War ll in the South Pacific.

389
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,506
I've lost contact. Just went dead.

390
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,715
Right.

391
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,386
We've just lost contact with them, sir.

392
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,762
Thank you, soldier.

393
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,598
Commander.

394
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,574
Are we all right here?

395
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,451
These bombs from the 20th century
can't hurt our ship.

396
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,496
Emmy, I'll go and check things outside.

397
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:18,043
That's crazy.
There's a war going on out there.

398
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,170
M-11 won't be hurt by those old bombs.

399
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,330
In Kwajalein and Luol islands,

400
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,708
all 6,600 of our brave soldiers
fought valiantly.

401
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,170
They fought to the very last man
without giving up.

402
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,922
They will go down in Japanese history

403
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,549
as the true defenders of the motherland.

404
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,384
Tomorrow, at dawn,

405
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:12,056
we are going to launch
our final, all-out attack.

406
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,017
Zoom.

407
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,602
<i>You all know that the Americans
greatly outnumber us.</i>

408
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,270
<i>But that does not matter.</i>

409
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:20,814
<i>Even up to the last moment each of us has,</i>

410
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,860
<i>we still have to believe
in our final victory over the enemy.</i>

411
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,197
That's Mr. Shindo.

412
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,659
He's younger, all right, but it's him.

413
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,578
Amazing.

414
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,205
Persevere!

415
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,082
Our deaths will be the flesh and blood

416
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,876
of an even greater and much stronger Japan!

417
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,756
Charge!

418
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,107
A dinosaur?

419
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,294
Amazing.

420
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,588
It's incredible. I can't believe it.

421
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,757
I can't believe it.

422
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,884
Let's disembark.

423
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,671
Commander?

424
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,970
That's Godzilla. I'm sure of it!

425
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,056
Right, then. It's confirmed that it's Godzilla.

426
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:32,853
Our job now is to teleport it away.

427
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,148
Let's go to the day
the Japanese soldiers evacuate.

428
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,106
Attention!

429
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,532
We deeply regret
that we must leave our savior behind.

430
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,161
Though we weren't able to seize this island,

431
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,081
please forgive us.

432
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,667
There is nothing that we can do.

433
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,631
We can't mend your wounds.
We cannot take you to safety.

434
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,009
We hope your wounds heal quickly

435
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:47,969
and that you will recover to full health.

436
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,933
We, the Lagos garrison
of the Japanese army,

437
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,978
will never forget how you saved our lives!

438
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,482
Never.

439
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,906
Commander, the boat's leaving.

440
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,587
Present arms!

441
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:27,759
Rest!

442
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,014
We march home with honor.

443
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,183
Right face!

444
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,478
Forward march!

445
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,705
They all thought that the dinosaur
was going to die here on the island.

446
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,540
To think that in 15 years,

447
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,001
it would resurrect and return as Godzilla.

448
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,211
It might've been much happier

449
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,715
if it were just left here
all alone to die on this island.

450
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,469
Come on now.
History has no room for sentimentality.

451
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:13,180
Come, let's get back and finish up our work.

452
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:31,072
Lucky for us, the dinosaur is immobile.
That makes it easy.

453
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:34,868
Usually animals are very difficult
when they are awake.

454
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:38,955
Because of this,
a thorough teleportation is possible.

455
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,011
Teleportation, start.

456
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:21,915
We did it.

457
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,625
Great!

458
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,614
Where are the dorats?

459
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,243
M-11, time warp.

460
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,075
- How was it? How did it go?
- We hardly did a thing.

461
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,869
M-11 and Emmy did all the work.

462
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,539
We had the most wonderful experience.

463
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,752
How did the teleportation go?

464
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,754
- A success.
- Good.

465
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,006
What about Godzilla now?

466
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,257
He's gone.

467
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:57,135
Fujio was in contact with us.

468
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,138
The Japanese naval observation post

469
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,223
sent a report right away.

470
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,935
So Godzilla's gone from history forever.

471
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:10,231
Everything has gone just as planned. So far.

472
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,109
So far?

473
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:15,403
Is there something
you haven't told us about?

474
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,657
Godzilla has disappeared,

475
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,410
and now King Ghidorah has taken his place.

476
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,371
King Ghidorah?

477
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:36,716
Godzilla suddenly disappeared
from the Sea of Japan.

478
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,053
At the same time, King Ghidorah
has appeared over the Pacific Ocean.

479
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,179
At the same time?

480
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,432
- Is there a connection between the two?
- We don't know anything yet.

481
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,771
It is confirmed that King Ghidorah
is already heading for Japan.

482
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,649
We're in more danger than ever before.

483
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,567
Fujio!

484
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,239
King Ghidorah has already reached Kyushu.

485
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:21,010
Look out, sir!

486
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,904
<i>King Ghidorah
is presently attacking Fukuoka.</i>

487
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:44,325
<i>A state of emergency has been issued.</i>

488
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:48,037
<i>Everyone must calmly evacuate.</i>

489
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,131
<i>Do not remain inside buildings.</i>

490
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,510
<i>Get to an underground shelter if possible.</i>

491
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:04,721
<i>Do not drive in your vehicles.</i>

492
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,227
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

493
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:15,356
<i>Fukuoka is being attacked by King Ghidorah.</i>

494
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,425
Are you hurt?

495
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:25,927
No.

496
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,014
My city is destroyed.

497
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,101
You won't get away with this,
you damn monster!

498
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,274
The dorats?

499
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,860
You mean that instead of the dinosaur,

500
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:45,196
they were exposed to the radiation
from the H-bomb test in 1954?

501
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,658
So those cute little animals

502
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,743
are now gigantic and savage?

503
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,913
It's possible

504
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:59,294
that Emmy intentionally left the dorats there
to be exposed to radioactivity.

505
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,922
It's possible that after they were exposed,

506
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:06,342
the three dorats merged into one
and turned into a giant monster.

507
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,888
So, if what both of you are saying is true,

508
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,682
King Ghidorah was created
by these people from future.

509
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,480
More importantly,

510
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:23,151
why would these people
create King Ghidorah

511
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,112
and destroy Japan?

512
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,078
The computer was right.

513
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:38,207
The three dorats
you took to the island of Lagos

514
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:43,796
turned into a monster
even more powerful than Godzilla.

515
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,468
Nobody told me we were the ones
who would create King Ghidorah.

516
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,512
The real issue was to see if

517
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:55,266
we could control it,
like we control the dorats.

518
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,269
It looks like we will be able to manipulate it.

519
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,562
Right, M-11?

520
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,068
Kyushu is finished. Next, we move north.

521
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:06,945
North?

522
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,363
Destroy Hokkaido.

523
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:11,199
What do you want? To destroy all of Japan?

524
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,117
All except Tokyo.

525
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:16,913
Then we'll show the Japanese
the proper way to rebuild their country.

526
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,289
We can't!

527
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:23,544
My dear, I hope that after you've seen
your country being destroyed,

528
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:27,090
you haven't forgotten what our mission is.

529
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,466
We came here

530
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,427
to warn the people of the 20th century.

531
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:35,348
This is pretty much terrorism.
You've gone too far.

532
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:27,025
<i>Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.</i>

533
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,444
<i>I have good news.</i>

534
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,947
<i>We'll publish your Godzilla story.</i>

535
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,784
<i>How about we call it The Birth of Godzilla?</i>

536
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,829
<i>Let's get together and talk about it.</i>

537
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,206
<i>I'm sure it'll be a big seller.</i>

538
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:45,501
<i>And if it is, how about thinking of marriage?</i>

539
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:47,754
<i>Call me back soon.</i>

540
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:57,305
I already know the title and even the date.
I even know how it sold.

541
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:05,063
Maybe the title Traveling <i>in</i> Time
would make it a bestseller.

542
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,939
That would be against the rules.

543
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,874
The Equal Environment Earth Union?

544
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:30,088
Its sole purpose is to equalize
the power of all nations on Earth.

545
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,424
All types of people joined our organization.

546
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:35,259
Modest people such as myself,

547
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:38,304
and some of them radical.

548
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,598
We used the time machine

549
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,227
to carry out the plan we had for Japan.

550
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,395
But why?

551
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:52,777
Actually, Godzilla didn't show up
until the 23rd century.

552
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:58,783
So then, what about the nuclear pollution
that destroys Japan?

553
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,034
It's all a lie.

554
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:04,831
Later on, Japan will become even stronger

555
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:07,166
and be the richest nation of the 21st century.

556
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,878
With all this wealth and great power,
it'll buy up nations.

557
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:13,673
South America and Africa.

558
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,884
And then in the 22nd century,

559
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:20,513
Japan will be bigger than China,
America and all of Europe.

560
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,765
No nation will compare to it.

561
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:25,935
So what you're saying

562
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:30,398
is that they've come here to destroy Japan
before all that happens.

563
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,867
Why did they have to come back
and destroy Japan in this way?

564
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:42,994
There's no other way.

565
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,245
At the end of the 20th century,

566
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,164
all nuclear weapons are banned.

567
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:50,668
Because of that, no organization
or government can control Japan,

568
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,753
not even the Earth Union.

569
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:55,840
So Wilson came up with his own plan.

570
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,676
Create a monster worse than Godzilla,

571
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,053
let it destroy 20th century Japan,

572
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:03,347
and cease the global domination.

573
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,786
Use and install our computer
into your government system

574
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:29,123
We are vulnerable to the will
of the people from the future.

575
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,126
We will end up as puppets.

576
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,088
It makes me believe that this is
their real purpose for coming to our era.

577
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,758
If we refuse all of their help,

578
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,968
King Ghidorah
will destroy the whole country.

579
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,805
Our armed forces

580
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,474
can't stop the monster.

581
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,188
Mr. Mazaki...

582
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:55,650
That dinosaur buried in the ocean.

583
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:59,153
Do you think we could somehow
change it into Godzilla?

584
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,741
Well, biological science aside,

585
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:07,828
based on experience, it can be asserted
that both King Ghidorah and Godzilla

586
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:11,958
were born from nuclear tests
at the Bikini Atoll.

587
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,337
However, Japan does not hold
any nuclear force to speak of.

588
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:23,844
The Teiyo Group has

589
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:26,180
a submarine with nuclear capabilities.

590
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,850
Don't worry.

591
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:35,523
Of course, we haven't kept the submarine
in Japanese waters.

592
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:40,278
She's in a South Pacific region
not too far away from us.

593
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,866
Your enterprise possesses such a thing?

594
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:54,166
The submarine does not have
nuclear weapons on board,

595
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,169
as it is not intended to be
used for military means.

596
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,881
The submarine is only for defending Japan
if there was a threat.

597
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:05,886
So, you plan to use missiles
to hit the dinosaur in the sea

598
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,097
and hope that it will turn itself into Godzilla?

599
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,515
Outrageous!

600
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,059
How dare we use nuclear weapons

601
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,020
just to create another Godzilla?

602
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:17,982
Well, what other alternatives do we have

603
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,568
to destroy King Ghidorah?

604
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,075
I'm afraid you don't understand.

605
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,123
Godzilla was my savior.

606
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,471
You say that you can feel Godzilla?

607
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,557
Yes, whenever I close my eyes,

608
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,685
I see him in flashes,
as though he is walking through ice.

609
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,897
It feels exactly
the way I felt it before in Mihara-yama.

610
00:55:58,314 --> 00:55:59,774
It can't be.

611
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:02,610
You know that Godzilla is no longer with us.

612
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:07,615
The one buried under the Bering Sea
is just a dinosaur.

613
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:12,244
It could be possible.
Maybe there's nuclear energy there.

614
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:17,666
Maybe there's sunken battleships
with nuclear missiles.

615
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,461
Or there could be nuclear waste there.

616
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,797
Is that possible?

617
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:29,095
NUCLEAR SUB SINKS
IN THE BERING SEA

618
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:30,846
This is it!

619
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,476
The claim that the nuclear material
was salvaged was obviously a lie.

620
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,522
Are you going home already?

621
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,691
And after he asks me to help him.

622
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,070
You can at least tell me what you're doing.

623
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,322
<i>It's for The Birth of Godzilla, of course.</i>

624
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:49,990
Right.

625
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:54,703
So, you think that Godzilla has been revived?

626
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,581
Well, I don't have any proof yet...

627
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:03,129
Well, this is something
I'd like to tell those government fools

628
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:05,840
who want to create a new Godzilla
with their nuclear weapons.

629
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,717
Whether it's true or not.

630
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:13,806
The Teiyo Group grew into a mega power
in the 23rd century.

631
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,350
They are untouchable.

632
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,231
There's news of Godzilla. He's moving.

633
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,237
This is a heat-sensitive satellite photograph.

634
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,407
And an enlargement of Godzilla
in the Bering Sea.

635
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,543
Where are you going?

636
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,255
I'm going to talk with Mr. Shindo.

637
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,175
That there's no need
to create another Godzilla.

638
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,551
I'm going with you.

639
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,423
Let's get away!

640
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,100
Go away!

641
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,854
I'm going to fall.

642
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,402
Whoa! Watch out!

643
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:37,032
No way!

644
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,713
He's lifting my cherished car.

645
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,715
Stop that!

646
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,426
What is he doing, that idiot?

647
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,511
No, don't go! You must not go out there!

648
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:59,888
- But Emmy...
- He's a robot.

649
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,516
This will end if I go back with him.

650
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,152
Welcome back.

651
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:19,158
We knew that you left to talk
to your Japanese allies.

652
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,869
Then why didn't you stop me?

653
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,914
Because we wanted to see
how the Japanese government would react.

654
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,125
We thought you could investigate for us.

655
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,586
You people are so evil in your ways.

656
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:34,089
So, are the Japanese planning

657
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,092
to resist our operation here?

658
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,428
Of course not.

659
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,472
The Japanese government is not stupid.

660
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,183
They know they can't fight us
with our advanced weapons.

661
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,644
Just as we thought.

662
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:50,314
I guess I was over-thinking things.

663
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,232
Over-thinking?

664
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,612
I thought that there might be
someone who would think

665
01:00:56,695 --> 01:01:00,199
to blast the dinosaur that exists
in the Bering Sea with radioactivity

666
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:03,160
and create another Godzilla.

667
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:07,331
We're presently 2.5 miles east of Kamchatka.

668
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:10,292
We're heading southeast for the Bering Sea.

669
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,586
Operation G. Roger.

670
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,835
So, how are you?

671
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:12,646
What's this? What's going on?

672
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,817
Emergency! Emergency! Operation G.

673
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,279
What is it? What's happening?
What's the matter? Come in! Come in!

674
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,378
What's that? It sank?

675
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,594
Are you serious? Godzilla sank the sub?

676
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:47,514
Where's Miki right now?
And where's Professor Mazaki?

677
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:50,225
I'll go with them now to Okhotsk.

678
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:01,904
On second thought, maybe I can't right now.

679
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:22,966
What's this?

680
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,345
This is the computer they want to give
to the Japanese government?

681
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,843
Look at how that dinosaur changed.

682
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:51,430
Now Godzilla has returned to Japan.

683
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,314
<i>Come in, Chitose Air Squadron!</i>

684
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,483
<i>King Ghidorah is very close to you,
just past Erimo Point.</i>

685
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,328
There it is! Commencing attack.

686
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,796
Ready! Fire!

687
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:29,676
Fire!

688
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:33,680
Direct hit.

689
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,113
Watch out!

690
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:58,080
He's closing in on us. Maneuver to the right.

691
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:08,924
We can't lose him! He's gonna hit us!

692
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,443
Pulling away! We're no match for it!

693
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,702
Their aircraft are so primitive.
It's no challenge.

694
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:38,954
They're just gonna have to give up.

695
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:41,498
They have no choice
but to accept all of our demands.

696
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,208
What is that?

697
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,376
What?

698
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,283
Army of Self-Defense
Mihoro Station

699
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,124
It's even bigger than it was before.

700
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,798
Confirming mobilization orders.

701
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,800
Scramble orders for 3rd fleet.

702
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,594
Scramble 3rd fleet.

703
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,435
It's much bigger.

704
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:46,229
If Godzilla was resuscitated
with modern nuclear weapons,

705
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:48,899
it's only natural that he's bigger than before.

706
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,193
On top of that,

707
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,570
he absorbed all of the submarine's energy.

708
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:04,456
So Godzilla was revived.

709
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:08,460
Unlike our age, in the 20th century,

710
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:11,630
there seems to be nuclear power everywhere.

711
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:16,718
It really didn't matter just what location
we teleported the dinosaur to.

712
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:20,430
The second birth of Godzilla
was an unavoidable event.

713
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,309
We went to the trouble of getting rid of one.

714
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:28,980
What a foolish era. There's no reason
to save these primitive people.

715
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,025
Send our monster to kill Godzilla!

716
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,618
It's King Ghidorah.

717
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:32,377
Once again, you fight for us.

718
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,139
Go, King Ghidorah!

719
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:49,329
No matter how strong Godzilla becomes,
Ghidorah will kill it.

720
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:53,500
As long as we can control King Ghidorah.

721
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:09,724
Come on.

722
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,017
Godzilla.

723
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:03,570
Godzilla is losing!

724
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,285
King Ghidorah will be victorious.

725
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,220
There's a malfunction in the computer room.

726
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:55,432
Soon enough, the time control
will automatically start functioning.

727
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,686
Emmy? What have you done?

728
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,604
You betrayed the union!

729
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:05,108
Forget about giving a computer to Japan!
It's been destroyed!

730
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,651
What do you mean?

731
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,323
Do you think you've won?

732
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:17,120
We don't need a computer or King Ghidorah
to do our work!

733
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,498
Godzilla is going to destroy
the country of Japan himself!

734
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:23,251
Your nuclear fanatics don't know
what they've created.

735
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:26,546
This new Godzilla is unfriendly
and is going to destroy your country.

736
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,047
There's nothing you can do about it!

737
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,217
Your country has no future now!

738
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,636
Our job here was a success,

739
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,723
and soon we'll be back in the 23rd century.

740
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,477
There is something you didn't know.

741
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,687
Our ship has an advanced safety device.

742
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:46,483
In the event of any emergency,
it sends us back to our own time.

743
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,651
Twenty minutes after the alarm goes off,

744
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:51,279
it sends us on our way.

745
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:52,947
<i>Time warp in 15 minutes.</i>

746
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,741
We'll be returning to our era.

747
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,034
You bastard!

748
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,580
Emmy!

749
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:03,666
Out of my way, God damn it!

750
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,354
Let her go.

751
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,158
Let me punch you one more...

752
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:42,121
Emmy!

753
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:44,601
<i>Time warp in 10 minutes.
Time warp in 1O minutes.</i>

754
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:07,332
Is it too late?

755
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:11,127
We can't let them go back to their own time
and get away with this.

756
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:15,089
<i>Time warp in five minutes.
Time warp in five minutes.</i>

757
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,554
Start teleportation.

758
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,113
We did it!

759
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:36,212
Have we time warped yet?

760
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,382
- No, not yet.
- Well, where are we, then?

761
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:43,302
<i>Time warp in one minute.
Time warp in one minute.</i>

762
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:28,848
It looks like King Ghidorah has been
destroyed, but what about Godzilla?

763
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,100
He's no longer the dinosaur we knew.

764
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:34,145
It may not be merciful
to Mr. Shindo or to Japan.

765
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,578
- Naval base to...
- Give Asashika...

766
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:54,373
- Confirmed report...
- The command...

767
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,751
Scramble lsawa forces...

768
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:01,714
I'm afraid this is no longer work
for ordinary civilians.

769
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:03,883
Please excuse me.

770
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:10,598
Does this look like the same beast
that was once your savior, Mr. Shindo?

771
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,438
PARANORMAL SCIENCE
RESEARCH CENTER

772
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,491
91%?

773
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:33,079
So it is likely that Godzilla will attack Tokyo?

774
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,623
This is an analysis
of Godzilla's probable actions.

775
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:38,709
It's calculated
from M-11's computer simulation.

776
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:41,420
So it's almost certain
that Godzilla will raid Tokyo.

777
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:45,174
Knowing this, Japan will be destroyed
just like Wilson said.

778
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,427
Godzilla's in Sapporo!

779
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:56,519
<i>Citizens of Sapporo,
Godzilla is approaching!</i>

780
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,647
<i>Everyone must evacuate!</i>

781
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,107
<i>I repeat.</i>

782
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,485
<i>Godzilla is approaching!
Evacuate immediately!</i>

783
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:17,290
Second squadron deployment complete.

784
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:50,239
Advance vehicles for attack.

785
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,727
Offensive engagement! Fire!

786
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,192
There's no way we can beat it.

787
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,448
We are no match at all for Godzilla.

788
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:02,204
King Ghidorah, who sunk in the ocean?

789
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,123
Yeah, that's right.

790
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:10,087
Could you revive him with technology
from the 23rd century?

791
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:12,339
Resuscitate him in the 23rd century,

792
01:24:12,423 --> 01:24:14,675
and then bring him back to the 20th century?

793
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:16,427
King Ghidorah's hurt very badly.

794
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,596
Will he survive until the 23rd century?

795
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:20,473
As long as his cells are still alive.

796
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:22,892
It's possible
if preserved in low temperatures.

797
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:26,645
Well?

798
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,148
Of course. I shall do it.

799
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:31,233
I exist to do so.

800
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:41,619
Well...

801
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,663
Make sure you come back.

802
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,207
I surely will.

803
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:50,503
I like this era very much.

804
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:55,549
You're lying. Aren't we primitive?

805
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:57,218
I'm not lying.

806
01:24:58,511 --> 01:24:59,595
SO Why?

807
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,686
Because there are people like you here.

808
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:33,796
2204 A.D.
THE SEA OF OKHOTSK

809
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:38,217
So King Ghidorah fought with Godzilla?

810
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,095
That's right. In the 20th century.

811
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:48,894
It's been 200 years.
I don't think he's still alive.

812
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:51,564
I hear him!

813
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:53,566
His heart is beating.

814
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,693
Only faintly, but I can hear it.

815
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:58,612
Please resuscitate him.

816
01:25:58,696 --> 01:26:00,906
What do you plan on doing with him?

817
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,533
We want to restore him back to life.

818
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:05,828
Are you going to turn him into a cyborg?

819
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:10,416
You're going that far
for a needy, Far East nation?

820
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,254
This is for a deficient nation

821
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:18,048
that drowned in nuclear waste

822
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:20,634
and was destroyed by a monster?

823
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:24,138
Please, give my ancestors

824
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,140
another chance.

825
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,980
All right, then. I'll let you do it.

826
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,781
1992 A.D.
TOKYO

827
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,786
<i>Godzilla has just landed at Tokyo Bay.</i>

828
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:51,290
<i>He is heading toward the city.
Everyone should evacuate immediately!</i>

829
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:52,917
This is a bad idea, you know.

830
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,668
Even journalists are prohibited.

831
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:56,378
Hey, I'm the Peter Arnett of Japan.

832
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:58,589
I'm a reporter that challenges the ordinary.

833
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,549
So you're challenging Godzilla?

834
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,092
- Don't worry. Come on.
- Okay.

835
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,386
When will it arrive at Shinjuku?

836
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,180
It should arrive in one hour.

837
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:09,725
Chief, evacuation is almost complete.

838
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:13,229
Minister, I'm afraid the destruction
is inevitable at this point.

839
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:15,981
This is an unavoidable sacrifice.

840
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:17,274
Yes, however...

841
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:23,322
At this rate, our country will be obliterated.

842
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:26,450
There's a call for you, sir.

843
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,584
This is Toguchi. Mr. Shindo?

844
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:38,671
What? Still in Shinjuku?

845
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,422
<i>It's heading your way!</i>

846
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,592
Yes, I know that.

847
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:47,638
But this is the way that I wanted it.
Let me have it my way.

848
01:27:48,264 --> 01:27:52,017
My life had long ended on Lagos Island.

849
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:55,854
I was saved by that dinosaur,

850
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,275
enabling me to live
and establish this country.

851
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:05,739
And the fact that now
it is being destroyed by that same dinosaur

852
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:11,495
is so very ironic.

853
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:35,954
Mr. Shindo!

854
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:54,223
Mr. Shindo is in there? So then...

855
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,521
ls Shindo dead?

856
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,147
Yes.

857
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:10,239
So just what was this dinosaur
to him anyway?

858
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:17,913
Emmy“

859
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,834
Was it not possible?

860
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:27,566
All right, Emmy!

861
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:31,630
Here we go, M-11 computer. Ready?

862
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:12,564
Hey, boss. What should we do?

863
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:14,232
What do you think? Run, you fool!

864
01:34:42,135 --> 01:34:43,679
Closing in on Godzilla.

865
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:45,639
<i>Emmy, be careful.</i>

866
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:45,759
Get up and run, Emmy!

867
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,886
Emmy, what's the matter?

868
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,398
Capture equipment ready.

869
01:37:33,849 --> 01:37:35,100
Yes, I know that.

870
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:49,656
I did it!

871
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,644
<i>Emmy, there's no time to be happy.</i>

872
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:22,230
<i>We aren't able to withstand his rays anymore.
We'll be finished.</i>

873
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,899
I know that.

874
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:49,007
Emmy“

875
01:39:01,728 --> 01:39:03,939
Thank you very much, Emmy!

876
01:39:05,357 --> 01:39:09,527
I'll have to live for 200 years to thank you.

877
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:16,618
Terasawa, there's something
I never got the chance to tell you.

878
01:39:17,369 --> 01:39:21,539
You're a distant grandfather of mine.

879
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:24,501
<i>Emmy, 1O seconds to time warp.</i>

880
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:29,673
Goodbye, my homeland.
