1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,760
[crowd chattering]

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
[peppy tune]

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,480
[honking]

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,400
Look.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,680
[all] Jack! Jack!

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,080
-Jack, can you sign this for me, please?
-Jack--

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,600
-[forklift beeping]
-[woman] Oh!

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,760
[tires screech]

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,560
What?

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
[peppy tune continues]

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,320
[man] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stand back.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,840
[forklift beeping]

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Whoa!

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
[electricity crackling]

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,960
[theater bell ringing]

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,440
-[bell continues ringing]
-[chaotic screaming]

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
[emcee] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,640
<i>please go wild and crazy,</i>
<i>and welcome to the stage</i>

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,000
<i>Mr. Jack Whitehall!</i>

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,240
[applause and cheering]

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,280
[yelling] Hello, Wembley!

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
Wow, it doesn't get
any more prestigious than this.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm quite nervous. I'm quite nervous.
I've got to be frank with you,

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,680
I have a history of cocking up
prestigious gigs.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,000
The most I have ever bombed on stage
[laughs]

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,960
was when I was booked
to do Prince Charles' Christmas party.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,880
It was exactly as weird as it sounds.

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,880
The first thing that was weird
about this gig is that I walked out,

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,600
Charles and Camilla
were sat in the front row,

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
in high-backed chairs.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,880
I was thinking: "You are aware
this is real life, not <i>Game of Thrones?"</i>

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Also, don't sit in the front row.

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,080
The front row as a comedian
is the get-out-of-jail-free card.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,880
If the jokes aren't working,
you talk to the front row.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,600
Ask them what they do for a living.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
I can't ask Prince Charles
what he does for a living.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,480
He is the most famous
unemployed man on the planet.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,560
"What do you do for a living?"
"Just sort of sit around,

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,920
wait for my parent to die."

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
"Me too."

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,160
So I can't do
the "what's your job?" crowd work,

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,680
'cause my front row
is a couple on benefits.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm glad you laughed.
I'm not gonna lie,

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,480
on the night,
it did not go down well.

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,600
Meghan was the only one laughing
which, if anything, made it worse.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,000
The other weird thing about this gig is
that they didn't give me a microphone,

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,000
which is literally
the only thing I need as a comedian.

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,440
'Cause this is the only thing
that gives me status over you.

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
Without this, I am just...

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,240
[yelling]
the crazy guy shouting on the high street!

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
With this: "Hi, I'm here to talk to you
about politics."

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,680
Without it: [yelling] "I'm here
to talk to you about Jesus!"

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,880
No microphone, right?
They're in the front row.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,640
Forty-five minutes, I had to do.

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,960
Forty-five minutes of dancing around
in front of the royal family

56
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,000
like I was the court-fucking-jester.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,160
My final indignity occurred, though,
after the gig.

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,040
Now, as a comedian, you know
when you have had a bad show.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,240
You do not need to be told it.

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,240
You especially do not need to be
bantered by the future King of England.

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,720
I was introduced to Prince Charles.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,680
Do you know what the first thing was
that he said to me?

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,400
"I think next year we'll try a magician."

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
Cheeky fucker!

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,640
It's fine, it's fine. I hooked him up
with my friends at <i>Magic Mike.</i>

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
Camilla bloody loved them.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Know your crowd.  The lesson
that I learned that night.

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,840
It's important as a comedian.
It's hard when you're traveling.

69
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,640
I've been living in America.
Do we have any Americans?

70
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,080
[scattered whooping]

71
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Whoa, okay.

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,760
Yes, they're certainly American.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
Okay, please don't shoot.

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,640
No... Applaud all you want. Sir...

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Sir, they can applaud.
I'm still trying to break America.

76
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,880
There is no way
that comment is ending up in the special.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,600
Over my dead body.

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,320
Figure of speech.

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,960
I come in peace.
I love America. It's an amazing place.

80
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
And do you know
what I've come to realize?

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Americans, you basically
do everything that we do,

82
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,160
but you do it bigger,

83
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,880
and you do it better.

84
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
Like, we have stupid people here...

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,480
but your stupid people are world class.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,600
And that is not me saying:
"All Americans are stupid."

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,920
No, America also has
the smartest people on the planet.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What I'm saying is
that when America does stupid,

89
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,080
you <i>do</i> stupid.

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,280
Like, our village idiot is in a park,
shouting at clouds.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,080
Yours is president.

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,000
[applause and cheering]

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,080
The world is becoming
a dumber place.

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,800
You know how you know this?
You know this from signs.

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,320
I'll give you an example.

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,040
I was in Tucson, Arizona.

97
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,520
And I went down for breakfast in my hotel,

98
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,920
and there was a sign on the toaster
in this hotel that said:

99
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,080
"Please butter bread..."

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,600
[scattered laughter from audience]

101
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,320
"...after use."

102
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,000
If you do not know
that you are meant to butter your toast

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,400
after it has been toasted,

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
you should not be allowed
anywhere near a toaster,

105
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,720
unless you are taking it with you
into a bath.

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,880
To be fair, right? This sign was affixed
to the worst invention

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,800
that mankind has ever created.

108
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the hotel...

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
conveyor belt toaster.

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,200
No one in this entire 10,000-strong arena

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,520
has ever made a decent piece of toast

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,720
on the hotel conveyor belt toaster.

113
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,080
Unfathomably shit.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,160
And handily fitted with a small window,

115
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,560
so you can witness your misery
play out in slow motion.

116
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,920
First time through.

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,240
Whoosh!

118
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Still bread.

119
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,280
Second time through.

120
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Whoosh!

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,320
Barely warm.

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,600
Third time through.

123
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
[yelling] Burnt to a crisp!

124
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,720
There is literally no setting
to get it right.

125
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,120
It's like putting a ginger on a sunbed,
it's impossible.

126
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,760
And there's always a queue
out into the lobby

127
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,880
'cause you got stuck behind some old man

128
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,480
that thought it was a good idea
to put in a bagel.

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,280
A bagel? Are you out of
your fucking mind, Granddad?

130
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,440
If you wanted a bagel toasted
in that machine in time for breakfast,

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,840
it needed to go in a week ago.

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,520
By the time that's toast,
you might be as well.

133
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
Then it's like they went:

134
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,000
"Oh, how can we make
this machine even shitter?

135
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,040
I know, let's have
your piece of crappy toast

136
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
be delivered
onto a little tray underneath it

137
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
that we set at a slight angle,

138
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,720
so your piece of shitty toast is sent
flying straight onto the bloody floor."

139
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,120
You see people waiting for it to pop out,
like fielders in the slip cordon.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,080
"Oh, this is going to be
a slippery catch to take."

141
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,080
"Why's that?"

142
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,040
"Well, I'm one of those psychopaths
that likes to butter the bread before."

143
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
It wasn't even the worst sign that I saw.

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,400
The worst sign that I saw was
in the same hotel, but it was by the pool.

145
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,000
I went down to the hotel pool

146
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,799
to have a lovely, refreshing dip
in the hotel pool,

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,280
when I read a sign,
ladies and gentlemen,

148
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,080
that stopped me in my tracks,

149
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,600
and it chilled me to the core.

150
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
It read like this:

151
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,520
[in American accent]
"Would you please

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,040
refrain from entering
the hotel swimming pool

153
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,480
if you have

154
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,000
active...

155
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,640
diarrhea."

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,960
Well, thank you very much
for putting me off this,

157
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
or indeed, any swimming pool ever again.

158
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,160
Because that sign can only exist...

159
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,440
because someone did.

160
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,520
How is that something that we need
a sign to remind us of?

161
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,760
Don't get me wrong, I like swimming
as much as the next man.

162
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
But I accept that if I am
in the clutches of an attack...

163
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,520
of active diarrhea,

164
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
there are certain activities

165
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,440
that I will not be participating in
for a short while.

166
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Swimming,

167
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,480
trampolining,

168
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,320
horseback riding, skydiving,

169
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,920
probably tandem skydiving as well.

170
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,040
I personally am the kind of person
that lives his life governed by the fear

171
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,480
that I might, one day,
shit myself in public.

172
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
Case in point, every time I'm in a car

173
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,160
and I do not realize
that the heated seat is on,

174
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,200
I'm like: "Fuck, today's the day."

175
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,040
Also, more importantly,
what on earth does this phrase even mean?

176
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,800
<i>Active</i> diarrhea. As opposed to what?

177
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,680
Inactive diarrhea?

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
"Yes, we've had diarrhea in the family
for generations.

179
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,000
My great-grandfather traveled to India,
picked up a bit of the old Delhi belly,

180
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,600
but fortunately,
as he got the dormant kind,

181
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,640
none of us have ever soiled ourselves."

182
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,840
[snorts like a pig]

183
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
I can only assume that active diarrhea

184
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,920
means it is literally
coming out of your ass.

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,480
If that is the case,
and for some baffling reason

186
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
you have decided
that your best chance of salvation

187
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,520
is the crowded hotel swimming pool,

188
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,840
I don't think you're the kind of fucker
that stops to read a sign.

189
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,280
"What's this? 'No running, no diving...'
But ah, yes, nothing about shitting.

190
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,520
Well, bombs away."

191
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
[applause and cheering]

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
This is the world that we live in, though.

193
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,040
We have to care about everyone's feelings,
everyone's tolerances,

194
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,520
everyone's intolerances,

195
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,600
everyone's... dietary... requirements.

196
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll tell you where it's gone too far,
and I have to be the person to say this.

197
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,600
For the love of God...

198
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,040
we have got enough...

199
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
milks now.

200
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,840
Would everyone stop
[yelling] milking shit?

201
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,760
I went to buy coffee recently.

202
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
Near to where I live, in London,
a very rough part of London

203
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
called Notting Hill.

204
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,000
I went in there.
I have very straightforward coffee tastes.

205
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,920
It should have been
a very straightforward transaction.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,560
It was anything but.

207
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,040
I went in there. I was like:
"Hello, I'd like a white coffee, please."

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,760
"Okay, sir, what kind of milk
would you like with your coffee?

209
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,560
We've got a coconut milk,
we've got an almond nut milk,

210
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,000
we've got hazelnut milk,
we've got cashew milk,

211
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,320
we've got a macadamia nut milk,

212
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
we've got oat, rice, hemp, soy milk.

213
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,760
You can have it from a bean,
pulse, nut, grain, oat, lax,

214
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,640
from a leaf, seed, tree."

215
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,000
[laughter, applause]

216
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,720
"I'd like it from a nipple, please."

217
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,000
"I don't care what type of nipple.
Preferably a cow's, but I'm not fussy.

218
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,680
I'll take it
from whatever nipple I can get."

219
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,480
She looked at me like I had requested it
from hers.

220
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,160
Like I was the weirdo. I'm not the weirdo.

221
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,120
You're the one in the back
of the shop with your friends,

222
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,400
milking fucking cashew nuts.
You're the freaks, not me.

223
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,760
I do not, for one moment,
doubt that lactose intolerance

224
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,920
is a very grave and pressing issue
for humanity.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But lest I remind you,
we currently don't have a cure for cancer,

226
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,840
and there are 12 readily available
milk substitutes on the market

227
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,040
which, I would argue,
is 11 more than we need.

228
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,040
And look, we're all having fun.

229
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,800
I don't want to turn my special
 into a TED Talk.

230
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
But I'm about to hit you up

231
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
with some
pretty sophisticated science here.

232
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,560
Milk must come... from a tit.

233
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,280
Last time I checked, the almond?
Pretty flat-chested.

234
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,920
You are drinking... nut juice.

235
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,640
Oh, dear.
[laughs]

236
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,400
I worry this may be
a little bit of a London problem.

237
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
[giggles]

238
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,960
On this tour that I've been doing...

239
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,880
I bring this up 'cause I was
in the northeast of England

240
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,280
and we were doing a show there,
and we were staying

241
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,840
in this tiny, little hotel
in the middle of nowhere.

242
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,760
It was amazing.
There was a slightly older gentleman

243
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,120
that was serving us breakfast
at this hotel.

244
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,360
And my tour manager, Johnny,
asked him about the milk situation.

245
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,720
He got the best response
I have ever heard.

246
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,840
He was like: "Excuse me,
what are the milk options?"

247
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
The guy went: "Hot...

248
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,280
or cold."

249
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,840
Where are the dairy drinkers in?
Who's a dairy drinker here this evening?

250
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,520
[cheering]

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,360
You do realize we are the smokers of 2020?

252
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,120
Seriously. Watch as we get
slowly ostracized from society.

253
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,720
They'll give us our own designated areas
to go and drink our dirty titty milk in.

254
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,000
They'll have warnings soon,
like with the cigarettes.

255
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,400
You'll go into the supermarket,
pick up a carton of milk,

256
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,080
there'll be a sticker on it:

257
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,920
"Warning, may cause
healthy bones and teeth."

258
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,440
And don't you dare,
don't you dare, in 2020,

259
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,360
drink your disgusting titty milk...

260
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,480
through a plastic straw.

261
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,360
Oh, no, no, you may as well be sucking it
directly from the devil's dick.

262
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,200
I got that lecture recently
from a friend,

263
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,080
a friend
who's the classic environmental hypocrite.

264
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,280
I don't know
if you've come across this woman.

265
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,280
She gives it all the:
"Yeah, I've got my reusable coffee cup

266
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,040
and my reusable water bottle,
all in my eco-friendly grocery bag."

267
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,000
You drove here in a fucking Hummer.

268
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,360
She comes at me about the straw:

269
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,760
"Jack, you can't use
a plastic straw anymore.

270
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,840
What about the environment?
What about the wildlife?

271
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,880
You need a reusable straw."
I was like:

272
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,520
"Okay, fine, understood." I went,
I got myself a reusable straw.

273
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,120
It's made of ivory.
It works a fucking treat.

274
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,680
Doing my bit, doing my bit.
Don't use a coffee cup anymore,

275
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,360
I take my turtle shell into Starbucks.
I'm like: "Fill that bad boy up."

276
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,360
And I've started recycling condoms, so...

277
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,840
Yeah, the big man knows
what I'm talking about.

278
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,280
Quick rinse, get rid of any nut juice,
stick it on the washing line.

279
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,960
It's a bag for life.

280
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
We've got to do our bit.
Do our bit now.

281
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,640
I had the vegan Impossible Burger
the other day.

282
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,920
Oh, my God, amazing. Here's the twist.

283
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Tastes just like
a regular hamburger, but...

284
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,320
it's the price of two hamburgers.

285
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,720
And guilt-free.

286
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,560
Plus, you can get any topping you like.
I went for bacon and <i>foie gras.</i> Mmm!

287
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,319
'Cause that, is the answer.
We should all be going vegan.

288
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,720
My uh... flatmate, Hugo, recently...
[giggles]

289
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,240
Of course, Hugo.
I'm just a normal guy. No.

290
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,319
The Hugester, he's great.
Um... he lives in the east wing and...

291
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,920
Anyway, he's a vegan,
but here's the thing.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,480
He didn't want to call himself a vegan

293
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,319
'cause he was worried that some
of his friends might give him shit. <i>Moi.</i>

294
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,599
So... instead of calling himself a vegan,

295
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,640
Hugo decided
that he was going to identify as...

296
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
Get ready for it
because it is a humdinger.

297
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
...plant-positive.

298
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
Ah, nice work, Hugo.

299
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,600
Successfully sidestepped
the wanker bullet there, didn't we?

300
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,640
And it's now literally every other word
out of his mouth.

301
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,880
He's like: "Jack, you can make
as many jokes as you like

302
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,720
about me being plant-positive.

303
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,280
I'm going to live
ten years longer than you."

304
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,160
"Yeah, not if you keep calling yourself
plant-positive around me.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I will smother you in your sleep.

306
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,720
Actually, I won't even need
to smother you now. You're a vegan.

307
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,640
I'll just place the cushion on your face,
you'll be too weak to lift it off."

308
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,760
"You're suffocating me."

309
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,040
"No, just making you oxygen-negative."

310
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
[laughter and applause]

311
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,240
It's no good crying over spilt nut juice.

312
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
Where are the vegans at?
We got vegans in?

313
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,280
Okay, an army of them. Oh, dear.

314
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,600
I'm going to get booed off stage
in a hail of tofu. I--

315
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm sorry. Honestly, I am.
I come in peace, okay?

316
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't want any beef,
and, quite frankly, neither do you.

317
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,680
Vegan-bashing, that's what that was.

318
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,440
And it is, excuse the pun,
low-hanging fruit.

319
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,360
Because there is no denying,
your life choice,

320
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,600
Hundred percent better for you,
better for the world.

321
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,840
I also know why... human beings
have a pop at vegans.

322
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,480
It's a very simple human instinct.
As human beings,

323
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,840
we basically just can't bear anyone else

324
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,520
that has exercised
any degree of self-control.

325
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,880
And you all fucking do it.

326
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,840
Doesn't matter what that self-control is.

327
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,240
Someone that's become a vegan,
someone that's given up drinking,

328
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,040
someone that's running a marathon,

329
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,880
someone that has started cycling to work.

330
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,840
Your mouth goes: "Oh, good for you."

331
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,640
And your head goes:

332
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,200
"Cunt."

333
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
[laughter and applause]

334
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,320
Because we don't want people
#LivingTheirBestLife.

335
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,840
We want them
#LivingASlightlyShittierLifeThanUs,

336
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,920
so we can feel better
about our pathetic existence.

337
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,880
That's why all those dickheads
get wound up by Greta Thunberg.

338
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,680
I mean, talk about living your best life.
She has put the entire world to shame.

339
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,640
That girl is a boss. She is a child. Yes.

340
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,760
[cheering]

341
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,200
She is a child and she has raised
a global climate change revolution.

342
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,360
When I was a child,
I couldn't raise a Tamagotchi.

343
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
She's at the UN, telling them:

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,240
"We need to save the planet
through radical action."

345
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,160
I was like: "Mommy, it's making
a funny noise and asking me to feed it,

346
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,320
what do I do?"

347
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,080
"Just send it to boarding school."

348
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,880
We also have no excuse now.
It's never been easier

349
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,800
to be a better citizen of the world.

350
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
I was in the supermarket recently.

351
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,040
Not Waitrose, or Whole Foods,
before you start judging me.

352
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,720
Sorry to disappoint,
Not doing Waitrose jokes.

353
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,920
Been told to cut them out.
For real.

354
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,760
After my last tour,
my manager took me aside and said:

355
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,560
"Jack, your reference points
are a little unrelatable.

356
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,840
If you ever want to be a comedian
you know, a man of the people,

357
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,400
cut out the Waitrose stuff."
So, understood.

358
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,440
'Cause I'm a normal guy.

359
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,000
So the other day, I was
in the supermarket, my favorite,

360
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,200
the "Lie-dl."

361
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,880
[laughter from audience]

362
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,760
Or when I'm in the States, "Walmar."

363
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,960
I saw a sign in the supermarket, though,
for Veganuary.

364
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,800
That is a great idea,
giving up meat for a month.

365
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,080
All onboard with that.

366
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,640
But why January?

367
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,680
On behalf of everyone, can I please say,

368
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,680
people need to back the fuck off January.

369
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,400
We already have Dry January.
Now we have Veganuary.

370
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,640
Newsflash: January already
the shittest month of the year.

371
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,720
That is not the month
you should be giving up vices.

372
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,120
If anything, that is the month
you should be finding new ones for.

373
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
"Jack, are you giving up
booze and meat for January?"

374
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,600
"Nope, but I will be taking up heroin."

375
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,640
Yeah, the month flies by,
and that Christmas weight just drops off.

376
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,240
Who's with me? 2021, Smackuary.

377
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,480
[laughter and applause]

378
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,760
Got to be more ethical

379
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,400
'cause the meat eaters
can be more ethical as well.

380
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,160
Can ask the right questions.
Got to pick your moments.

381
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,800
I'm a normal guy, so I took a girl
on a date

382
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,920
to the Nan-doss.

383
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,800
She started asking questions
about the chicken.

384
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,200
There is a time and a place
for asking questions about the chicken.

385
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,200
Nan-doss is not it.

386
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,080
The poor guy there
didn't have a fucking clue.

387
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,560
She asked him where the chicken was from.
He said: "The fridge."

388
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,160
That's the thing. You've gotta be aware
of the food eaten

389
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
by the food that we're eating.

390
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,400
I saw an article the other day

391
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,920
saying you are no longer allowed
to feed ducks in the park bread.

392
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,480
Do you know why?

393
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,120
Because it makes them... bloated.

394
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,960
They're ducks.

395
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,800
Their job...

396
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,280
is to float.

397
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,440
What does it matter if they're bloated?
That's a fucking advantage.

398
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,440
Started listing alternatives.
Instead of feeding them bread,

399
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,440
you could feed them corn kernels,
you could feed them peas,

400
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,800
you could feed them grapes. Grapes?

401
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,640
Am I visiting this duck in hospital now?

402
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,360
Can you imagine
how much of an asshole

403
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,360
I would look like
if I turned up to my local park,

404
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,560
everyone else is chucking in
moldy bits of bread,

405
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,800
I turn up with a basket of grapes?

406
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,440
"Oh, you may be ducks,
but today you will feast like swans.

407
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,680
Don't fill up too much, you won't leave
room for the cheese board.

408
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,600
Here we are.

409
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Lie-dl's finest Latvian Camembert.
Come, enjoy, enjoy."

410
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,040
Gluten-free ducks.

411
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,440
Whatever next?

412
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,120
They'll be going keto.
That's what'll happen.

413
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,200
I can't keep up with the fad diets.
There appears to be a new one every week.

414
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
You've got juicers,

415
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,560
your fasters.

416
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,680
The fasters, that's the weirdest one.
It's like a cult.

417
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,040
Fast the 5:2 diet.

418
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,880
"Yeah, I'm doing the 5:2 diet.
For five days, I eat what I like.

419
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,480
For two days, I fast.

420
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,640
And for seven days,
I tell everyone about it."

421
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,960
And they're always so desperate
to tell you how good fasting is for you.

422
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,480
It's like: "I have eyes in my head,
I can see what's in front of me."

423
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,880
These people look emaciated,
physically weak.

424
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,840
Like prisoners of war.

425
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,240
"Oh, I'm so sorry,
I can't have that biscuit.

426
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
I'm actually doing a fast at the moment.

427
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,840
It's absolutely amazing,
you've got to try it sometime.

428
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,120
I haven't made saliva for three days."

429
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,040
"What have you lost?"
"Two stone and my vision."

430
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,600
[applause and cheering]

431
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,600
"It's honestly the best I've ever felt."

432
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,480
Oh, God.

433
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,880
I feel like a lot of this
will come back and haunt me.

434
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,760
I mean, in six months' time,
I will 100% be a vegan.

435
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,520
And... drinking falafel milk.

436
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,840
I'm just jealous of people
for living the life that I want to live.

437
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
I do it with everything. Like love-life.

438
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,720
Now that my love-life is a car crash,

439
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,120
I literally cannot be
around happy couples.

440
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,080
[audience] Aww.

441
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,680
Give me a cheer
if you're in a happy relationship.

442
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,000
[audience cheers]

443
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Mate, it doesn't work
if you drag your girlfriend's hand up

444
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,600
when I ask that question.
Frigging caveman over here.

445
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,040
[in deep voice]
"She happy."

446
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,760
Give me a cheer
if you're in an unhappy relationship.

447
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,720
[audience cheers]

448
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,200
Right, we can hang out.

449
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,320
I love spotting these unhappy couples.

450
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
I saw one the other day.

451
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,960
I was on a plane.
This husband and wife walked on.

452
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,720
I don't know
whether they were husband and wife,

453
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,360
but they were over 60.
So if you're over 60,

454
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,800
whether you're married or not,
you're a husband and wife.

455
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,800
'Cause there is nothing cringier

456
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,200
than anyone over 60

457
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,400
referring to themselves
as: "boyfriend and girlfriend."

458
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,680
You're not in primary school.

459
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,400
And I know that's ageist to say,
but unfortunately it's true.

460
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,080
I met this guy the other day. He was old.
Like, <i>old-</i>old.

461
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,400
Like, you could have got into his iPhone

462
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,800
by showing it one of your testicles,
like that.

463
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
He had to be pushing 80.

464
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,400
And he introduced me to the woman
that he was with: "This is my girlfriend."

465
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,760
That is your next of kin.

466
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,760
So the couple come on.

467
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,120
The husband sits down,
instantly falls asleep,

468
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,480
starts snoring out loud.

469
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,640
[snores loudly]

470
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,800
And the wife is looking over at him,

471
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,880
and loathing him
with every fiber of her being.

472
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,880
At one point he did that thing
like he was choking in his sleep. Like...

473
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,040
[choking, snorting]

474
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,280
I accidentally caught her eye.
She gave me a look as if to say:

475
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
"Shh!

476
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,000
If he goes, he goes."

477
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,440
He's got his tray table down.
She's written, "Do not resuscitate."

478
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,880
Whole flight, he snores out loud.
By the time it gets to the landing,

479
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,360
even the screaming baby was like:
"This guy's an asshole."

480
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,640
But because his seat
was ever so slightly inclined,

481
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,760
the air hostess had to come over

482
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,200
and put it into the upright position
for landing, or as we know,

483
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,760
the plane would've burst
into a ball of flames.

484
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,720
In doing so, she accidentally
wakes him up, and he was not best pleased.

485
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,600
He snapped at her. He was like:
[snorts] "Oh, my God,

486
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,960
is... is it really worth leaning over
and waking me up

487
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,360
for the sake of two inches?"

488
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,600
And his wife went: "Not in my experience."

489
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,720
There were high-fives.
The pilot had to do an announcement.

490
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,760
[imitates static] "To the lady in row 33,
you go, girl, you go!"

491
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,560
Everyone was loving it.

492
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,600
Other than me. I was thinking:

493
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,920
"This is the last time I ever sit behind
my fucking parents on a plane."

494
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,680
I'm glad you enjoyed that bit.

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,280
Do you know who did not enjoy that bit
the first time he heard it?

496
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
Michael Whitehall.

497
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,120
Oh, my God.
The first time he heard that bit,

498
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,600
he had the most Michael Whitehall
response you have ever heard.

499
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,040
I came offstage afterwards. He was waiting
for me, looming at the end of the bar,

500
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,560
like a pissed vampire.

501
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,520
He was like: "I didn't like
that new plane bit of yours."

502
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,160
I was like: "Daddy, obviously it wasn't
actually you guys, it was just a joke."

503
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,800
He went: "Row 33, I do not want
people thinking that we fly economy."

504
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,120
He's got even worse now, as well,
that he is a minor celebrity.

505
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
I'm not saying fame has gone
to his head, but the other day,

506
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,080
my dad was doing a medical questionnaire
and under "Occupation,"

507
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
he put: "National treasure."

508
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,680
We all know he's on borrowed time.

509
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,680
Eventually he's going to say or tweet
something that's gonna get him canceled.

510
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,640
We did this ancestry show on the BBC,
<i>Who Do You Think You Are?</i>

511
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,880
The answer, it turns out,
is: "an asshole."

512
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,560
Yep, my father comes from a long line
of assholes, it turns out.

513
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,280
On one side of the family,
we were taken to Birmingham. I was like:

514
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,360
"Great, I'm going to be related to
a Peaky Blinder." Nope, sex pest.

515
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,720
One of my ancestors was a philandering
con artist that got syphilis,

516
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,000
gave it to his wife, and they both died
in a mental asylum.

517
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,280
Well, it turns out, he was the good one.

518
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,320
Oh, yeah, my other ancestor
made old Cheaty McSyphilis

519
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
look like Mother Teresa.

520
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,480
Other side of the family, we visited Wales
and discovered that I'm related

521
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,360
to a prominent Welsh Tory M.P.

522
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,560
that introduced blood sports
to the nation,

523
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,480
then put down a revolt of Welsh workers
that were fighting for the right to vote,

524
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,080
and had the William Wallace of Wales
arrested,

525
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,320
and hung, drawn and quartered for treason.

526
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,000
So I'm finding all of this stuff out.
I was... I was upset,

527
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,120
I was moved, I was disturbed.

528
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,760
I turned to look at my dad.
Fucking nothing.

529
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,960
I was like:
"Daddy, you need to look more upset.

530
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,200
There are cameras on us.
Can you at least pretend to be sad?"

531
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,640
He went: "I am sad.
It is all deeply depressing.

532
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,080
I had absolutely no idea
that we were Welsh."

533
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,320
[silently mouthing]

534
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,800
I get it, right? I get it. Your perception
of your parents changes over time.

535
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,720
As a child, you look
at your mom and dad and you're like:

536
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,000
"You two are <i>the</i> most embarrassing people
that I have ever seen in my entire life."

537
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,280
Then you get a little bit older,
a bit wiser, you become an adult,

538
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,920
and eventually you go: "You know what?

539
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,240
Actually, I think these two
might be all right."

540
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,600
Then they retire and you spend more time
with them and you're like:

541
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
"Oh, no, I had it right the first time.

542
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,720
You're fucking mental."

543
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,640
And in my family,
my sister definitely gets it worse.

544
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,240
Last year, my sister got engaged.

545
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,080
That should have been
a lovely moment for our family.

546
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,040
And it was, for nought-point-five seconds.

547
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,080
Until she then announced she didn't want
to get married in a church.

548
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,120
Oh, dear.

549
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,840
Anyone would've thought she told him
she'd voted Green.

550
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,440
Did not go down well.

551
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,720
He went: "What do you mean you don't want
to get married in a church, Molly?

552
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,400
If I'm paying for this wedding,
you're not having it in a fucking barn.

553
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,920
If I'm paying for this wedding,
it will happen in a house of worship."

554
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,440
The look on his face when he finds out
we've booked a mosque.

555
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,120
Now the pressure's on me.

556
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,280
To get married. To have a child.

557
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,480
They keep asking: "When are you
going to give us a grandchild?"

558
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,320
I'm like: "I'm trying to put an end

559
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,840
to this bloodline
of syphilitic mass murderers."

560
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,280
But it's because I had
my first proper breakup recently.

561
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,720
I had an amicable breakup,
which people tell you is a good thing.

562
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,040
I'm here to tell you,

563
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,360
it fucking ain't.

564
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Much better to hate the person.

565
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,680
I say that as a person.
I also say that as an artiste.

566
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,160
Because the one advantage

567
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,440
of having tragedy
in your life as an artiste

568
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,000
is it can inspire great work.

569
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,320
No one has ever written a brilliant album
about a lovely breakup,

570
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,200
where everyone behaved impeccably.

571
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,840
I wanted her crushing my heart
into the floor,

572
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,840
throwing my clothes out of the window.

573
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
I wanted to get Adele'd, right?

574
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,760
Instead,
my ex-girlfriend took my mom for tea

575
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,520
to help my mom
transition through the split.

576
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,680
Yeah, fuck you with your kindness
and generosity.

577
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,920
I want to be rolling in the deep.

578
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,160
Instead, I'm in the shallow end,
making jokes about diarrhea.

579
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,960
Then we had this weird situation
where me and my ex were just friends

580
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,760
and we were living
in the same flat

581
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,000
for a couple of months.
That was very weird.

582
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,600
Trying to help each other acclimatize
to our new life as just friends.

583
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Shall I tell you the most tragic moment?

584
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,040
We were in the kitchen together,
and for the first time in six years,

585
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,040
she farted in front of me.

586
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,400
And no words were exchanged.

587
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,880
I just walked out of the room,
went upstairs,

588
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,800
locked myself in the bathroom,

589
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,000
and had a little cry
because I knew it was over.

590
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,880
In one gust, she had broken wind
and my heart.

591
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
[exhales]

592
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,800
Some of this new material's quite bleak.

593
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,800
Seriously, though.

594
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,880
She was farting in front of me.

595
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,600
She was trying to make herself
less attractive to me.

596
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,080
She was literally
trying to fart herself off the pedestal.

597
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,240
But it didn't work. I am a man.

598
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,160
It only made me love her more.

599
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,120
Then I tried to play ball as well.

600
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,400
I was like: "Is there anything I could do

601
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,520
to make myself less attractive to you?"

602
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,960
She went:
"No, I think I'm pretty much there."

603
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,760
Now I've got to put in an effort again.

604
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,920
Got to put a shift in in the bedroom
again, I don't like having to do that.

605
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,040
Oh, no, I'm very conservative
in the bedroom.

606
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,120
No thrills with me between the sheets.

607
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,840
I always say, sex with me is like
arriving late at the theater

608
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,400
and trying to find your seat.

609
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,440
Lot of shuffling, bit of shushing,
a pause,

610
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,080
and from somewhere in the darkness,
a whispered:

611
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,280
"I'm sorry."

612
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,239
[laughter and applause]

613
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,000
Unfortunately, never that noise. I--

614
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,199
I'm just not equipped for any of this.

615
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,920
I'm not equipped
for a breakup emotionally,

616
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,760
'cause I am a product
of the British public school system.

617
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,520
If a relationship broke down
at boarding school,

618
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
you weren't encouraged to talk about it.

619
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,800
Mainly 'cause a lot of those teachers
could've lost their jobs.

620
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,760
The closest I've come to a relationship
since, though, has been with Alexa.

621
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,560
Ah, lovely Alexa.
Stores and records everything you say,

622
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
so that she can use it in the future.

623
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,880
Just like a real girlfriend.

624
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,160
And I lead the bachelor lifestyle now.
Woohoo, bachelor lifestyle!

625
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,760
Breakfast for dinner. Fuck, yeah.

626
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,840
Same underpants for a week.
Did someone order a legend?

627
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,560
Ooh, is this just the kitchen sink,
or is it also now the downstairs toilet?

628
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,800
Too far? [laughs]
I love saying that onstage every night,

629
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,640
and then looking out into the crowd,
without fail,

630
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,120
always seeing
at least four or five guys laugh,

631
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,360
and then turn to their missus and be like:
"I have no idea what he's talking about."

632
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,840
Was that rock bottom, or was rock bottom
going to the kitchen and realizing

633
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,440
that the only food I had left in the house
was the emergency Pot Noodle,

634
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,960
only to then discover,
she'd taken the kettle?

635
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,240
"Well, I guess you're getting filled up
directly from the hot tap."

636
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm not proud of myself.

637
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,360
Sat on the sofa in a Slanket,

638
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,800
crunching through an <i>al dente</i>
Bombay Bad Boy,

639
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,280
hoping it will give me the sustenance
I need to return to the job at hand,

640
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,080
namely seeing whether it is possible
to wank yourself into a coma.

641
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
"Say my name, Alexa."

642
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,160
"Jack Whitehall."

643
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,160
"Yeah!

644
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,960
Who's the daddy?"

645
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,600
"Searching Michael Whitehall."

646
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,840
"No! Don't do that."

647
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,640
I think it's fair to say,
I went off the rails a little bit.

648
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,440
It all came to a head when I went
to... to Germany for a weekend.

649
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,360
Uh... quite sad, actually.

650
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,680
Last year, we went to Berlin
to say goodbye to a friend of mine,

651
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,960
who we lost in June... June, July?

652
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,720
It was a summer wedding,
I can't remember when.

653
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,880
That's right. After the self-pity stage
of breakup grief

654
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,200
comes the "getting annihilated" stage,

655
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,800
and where better to do that

656
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,800
than surrounded
by all of your happily married friends?

657
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,280
#LivingAShittierLife.

658
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,600
So I've been up for three days
on this stag-do,

659
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
and I'm in Berlin Airport,
on the way home.

660
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm stood in the queue
for airport security,

661
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,240
and I put my hand into my pocket
to take out my passport,

662
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,520
and instead, I withdraw
a single edible weed gummy.

663
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,280
Oh, dear. I look around
for somewhere to dispose of this thing,

664
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,040
there is nowhere in immediate sight.

665
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,240
For a brief moment,

666
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,960
it crossed my mind
for a second,

667
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,120
I looked in front and there was
a child with an open backpack.

668
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I didn't, 'cause I'm not a monster.

669
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,720
And I couldn't distract his mom. S--

670
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,920
So I was like, reluctantly: "This is going
to have to go down the hatch."

671
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,240
So I swallow this thing.

672
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,520
Now, I am a little bit of a novice
when it comes to the old edible marijuana.

673
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,080
These things are incredibly strong.

674
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,520
It hit me like a fucking freight train.

675
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,680
By the time
I was at the front of this queue,

676
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,960
I was so high, I could've flown home
without the aid of an airplane.

677
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,680
I knew I was in serious trouble

678
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,080
when I was stood
in the body-scanning machine,

679
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,520
legs akimbo, arms aloft.

680
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,400
I was like:
"Why is it not scanning you?

681
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,520
[gasps] It's not scanning you
'cause it knows that you've got drugs

682
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,080
in your belly, you naughty boy."

683
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,120
I then realized the actual reason
it wasn't scanning me

684
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,320
was 'cause I was stood, legs akimbo,
arms aloft,

685
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,240
in a regular metal detector.

686
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,480
It was at that point that I heard
a German voice shouting at me from behind:

687
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,240
<i>"Das ist verboten."</i>

688
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,280
I'm no linguist, but I was certain
it wasn't the German for:

689
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,520
"Have a nice day.
The lounge is over there."

690
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,720
I turn around, the security official
is pointing very aggressively

691
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,640
at my midriff region
and shouting something in German.

692
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,640
I realize, with hindsight,
he was pointing at my belt.

693
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,080
He wanted me to take my belt off.
Unfortunately, I was so high,

694
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,720
I didn't even realize
I was wearing a belt.

695
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,760
For some reason, in that moment,
I thought that he was pointing...

696
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,520
at my trousers,
and I thought that he wanted them off.

697
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,440
I was like: "Wow, these German
security officials are awfully thorough."

698
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,840
But I went to a Catholic boarding school.

699
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,880
If a figure of authority tells you
to drop 'em,

700
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,440
you fucking drop 'em.

701
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,800
So, in the middle of Berlin Airport,

702
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,920
I began to slowly start
pulling down my trousers.

703
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,280
He did not like that one bit.

704
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,000
If anything, it made him even angrier.

705
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,000
He started shouting more.
He was like: <i>"Oben!"</i>

706
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,440
<i>Oben,</i> I've Googled it.
It's the German word for "up,"

707
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,160
as in: "Pull your trousers up."

708
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,880
I don't speak German.

709
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,560
I thought he'd shouted: "Open."
I was like:

710
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,560
"This has escalated."

711
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,760
The most worrying element of this story
is quite how compliant I was.

712
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,320
I thought, in that moment,
that a security official

713
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,320
wanted to anally cavity search me
in front of everyone in the airport,

714
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,720
and I put up no protest whatsoever.

715
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,400
He literally just had to shout
"open" once,

716
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,000
and I was assuming the position,
preparing for entry.

717
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,400
"Well, if that's the way it's got to go,
Fritz, that's the way it's got to go.

718
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,760
Stick a pinkie in there first,
if you would.

719
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,600
Call me old-fashioned
but I need to be wooed."

720
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,280
[applause and cheering]

721
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
This is why I need a girlfriend.

722
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,040
To keep me in line.

723
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,360
I'm not good at being single.

724
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I should have one-night stands,
that's what you're to do.

725
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,880
I'm scared of one-night stands.
Know why?

726
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,800
I'm scared of getting something.

727
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,200
My friend, he had a one-night stand.

728
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,400
He got the one that you can't get rid of.

729
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,320
Kids.

730
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,320
Did you just look at your daughter,
on the punchline of that joke?

731
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,760
That was brutal. "That's you, that is.
My little STD."

732
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,840
-She's what?
-[speaks indistinctly]

733
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,400
It's your wife? Oh, my God.

734
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,560
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

735
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,480
It's fine.

736
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,040
It's not like we're filming this.
It's not going anywhere, it's fine.

737
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,720
Fucking punching. I, uh...

738
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,640
Michael Whitehall would be proud.

739
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,560
The rest of the show is to this side.
I can't even look over there.

740
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,080
This guy's going to come up--
Stop waving at me.

741
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,560
No, that doesn't make it any better.
I already feel absolutely mortified.

742
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,640
Thank you, comedy gods.

743
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,000
But we must move on.

744
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,160
My point is, I'm not ready
to have a child. I'd be a terrible parent.

745
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,160
Oh, my God.
This was a sign I saw recently.

746
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,680
I was driving along the road.
There was a sign at the side of it:

747
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,400
"Drive like your children live here."

748
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,440
I was doing 130 when I hit that tree.

749
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,840
I did this recently.
Oh, my God. Has anyone ever done it?

750
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,320
I accidentally hit a kid skiing.

751
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,880
Someone's laughing over there,
like they've done it. Not good.

752
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,880
It probably wasn't your fault either.
It was so unfair.

753
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,760
To be fair to me, this little fucker
cut straight in front of me,

754
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,320
in the line for the buffet,
and I just lashed out.

755
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,880
The reality is, I reckon,
some parents don't help their kids.

756
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,040
I met a woman the other day
whose child's name...

757
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,120
was Isis.

758
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,280
I know.

759
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,440
I know.

760
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,600
She was like:
"It's Greek for 'goddess of nature.'"

761
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,440
I was like: "It's rest of the world
for 'shooty-shooty, bomb-bomb.'"

762
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,520
So you need to think of another name,
love, 'cause that one's been hijacked.

763
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,240
Wrong word, wrong word.

764
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,320
This wasn't information
she shared with the group.

765
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,720
This was information she casually dropped
into the conversation,

766
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,240
like it was a normal thing.

767
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,920
I'd never met this woman before
in my life.

768
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,440
You can imagine how concerned I was.

769
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,200
We're all sat there in the pub,
having a lovely drink,

770
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,800
when all of a sudden,
this complete stranger pipes up and goes:

771
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,720
"Well, I need to go home
to be up early tomorrow morning

772
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,480
to help Isis with a project."

773
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,320
"Sorry, I beg your fucking pardon?"

774
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,480
"Yes, typical Isis,
announces it at five o'clock

775
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,240
and it's me that's got to go to the shop
and buy all the bloody materials.

776
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,000
Then I've to pack the backpack,
drive to the bus stop.

777
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,240
I might as well take it to school myself."

778
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,720
"Take this bitch down right fucking now."

779
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,560
Eventually I realize
she's talking about her child.

780
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,080
I was like:
"You can't call your child Isis."

781
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,920
She was like: "I called her Isis
before the terrorist organization.

782
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,080
I was like: "I should fucking hope so."

783
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,120
But unfortunately, there are certain names
that get taken out of circulation.

784
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,920
That's why you don't swipe right
with many Adolfs on Tinder.

785
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,600
To be fair to Hitler...
which is a terrible sentence...

786
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,360
to start any routine with.

787
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,400
To be fair to Hitler--
Stop saying it, stop saying it. I...

788
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,520
I've always wanted a catchphrase,
I don't think that's the one to plumb for.

789
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,960
In Hitler's defense...

790
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,560
No, worse!
Worse, worse, worse. Worse.

791
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,560
Swastikas,
that's what I want to talk about.

792
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,440
Okay? Swastikas, okay?

793
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,200
Perfect example of appropriation.

794
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,520
Have you met this dickhead
that says to you:

795
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
"Oh, I don't know whether you know this,

796
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,280
but the swastika
is actually a Buddhist symbol"?

797
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,960
"Yeah... not anymore."

798
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,280
"No, it symbolizes the footprints
of the Buddha."

799
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,840
"You know what? Next time you walk
into a bar and you see a guy

800
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,800
with a shaved head
and a swastika tattooed on his neck,

801
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,280
you walk up to him
and give him your friendliest... namaste.

802
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,920
Let's hope you get reincarnated
as someone that's not a twat."

803
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,600
Anyway, I'm being harsh. I'm being harsh.

804
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,120
Obviously, this mother didn't call
her daughter Isis provocatively.

805
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,480
And apparently,
Isis was a lovely little girl.

806
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,600
And a wonderful sister, as well.

807
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,720
To her brothers, Hamas and Hezbollah.

808
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,840
Ah, that's a routine that feels like
it's on borrowed time.

809
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,840
The best thing about doing that bit is
I've been doing that for months,

810
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,680
and now that I've done it on tour,

811
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,640
you get other people coming up to you

812
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,480
that want to tell you
that their child is also called Isis.

813
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,000
And I tell you,
it attracts a certain type of person.

814
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,480
I was in a crowded hotel lobby
the other day.

815
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,520
This guy in a tweed jacket
comes striding towards me.

816
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,240
"Jack, my daughter's Isis as well."

817
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,920
"We are in public, mate."

818
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,280
"Come over here. Will you do a video
for her on the phone?

819
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,760
Come on. Do a video for her.

820
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,080
He's doing a video for Isis."

821
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,560
"Shut up!"

822
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,640
I'll tell you another one.

823
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,160
An awkward social situation
that I mess up on a daily basis now.

824
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,160
Not realizing that my AirPods
have not synced up to my mobile phone,

825
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,840
and my music is playing
to fucking everyone.

826
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,160
Had the worst one the other day.
Happened in the gym.

827
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Now, when I go to the gym,
I'm like The Rock.

828
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,040
No pain, no gain.

829
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,720
I leave nothing there.
I find an exercise bike in the corner,

830
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,080
and pop myself on it. Put on my hoodie,
stick in my AirPods,

831
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,120
and I'll put on something mellow.
We're talking audio book,

832
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,160
we're talking classical music,
we're talking film score.

833
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,680
I set the incline to nought-point-five,
and then I have a quiet little pootle,

834
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,840
like I am one of <i>Call The Fucking Midwife.</i>

835
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,240
Only on this occasion,
everyone in the gym is looking at me.

836
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,000
Now, for some reason,
my first thought was:

837
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,320
"Hmm, they must all be looking over here

838
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,920
'cause Quadzilla is burning
some serious rubber."

839
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,000
I then had an awful moment,
where it dawned upon me

840
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,880
that the reason everyone
in the gym was looking at me

841
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,760
is that I was in the corner,
on an exercise bike,

842
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,760
hoodie on, AirPods in,
playing to the entire gym,

843
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,960
the theme tune from <i>E.T.</i>

844
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,560
[laughter and cheering]

845
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,320
Do I look normal and nice again?

846
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,080
-[woman cheers]
-Yes, one woman, thank you very much.

847
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,320
[wolf whistle]

848
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,120
That wolf whistle was a little late.

849
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,880
But thank you.

850
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,040
I'm going to tell you one more story.

851
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,600
It's about my dad.

852
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,600
Look,
I know that I've made jokes about him,

853
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,920
and uh... the reality is, I love him
dearly, and I never take for granted

854
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,480
how lucky I am to spend that time
traveling around the world with him.

855
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,760
And I'm so proud of him,

856
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,440
for how much he puts himself
out of his comfort zone

857
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,880
to do the stuff that we do.

858
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,040
I get to see whole new sides to my dad
that I never thought that I would see.

859
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,000
And that's not to say that, on occasion,
I haven't pushed him too far.

860
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,640
And so I want to leave you with this story
about the occasion when I did just that.

861
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,760
And it was actually very traumatic
at the time.

862
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,720
It was something that we didn't feel like
we could put in the show,

863
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,240
because it wound up with him collapsing
and being rushed to hospital.

864
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,720
But...

865
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,840
tragedy plus time equals comedy.

866
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,120
So, here goes.

867
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,200
It happened when we went to the Ukraine,
and we visited Chernobyl.

868
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,040
Has anyone ever been to Chernobyl,
by the way?

869
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,240
-[whoop from audience]
-Just that woman over there.

870
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,160
Holding up her third hand.

871
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,760
It's a terrifying place,
terrifying place,

872
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,200
the site of the worst ever
nuclear disaster in human history.

873
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,760
Uninhabited now,
other than by packs of feral, stray dogs,

874
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,400
but, weirdly,
also now a tourist destination.

875
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,320
Fun for all the family.

876
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,720
They've got a gift shop in Chernobyl.
They've got a canteen in Chernobyl.

877
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,720
A canteen in Chernobyl, which no one
in their right mind would eat in.

878
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,560
Unfortunately, my father,
not in his right mind.

879
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,960
We went in there.
It was full of Japanese tourists.

880
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,920
Eventually,
I get to the front of the queue.

881
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,040
I was like:
"So, what's on the menu today?"

882
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,880
"Meat... in bun."

883
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,960
"Thank you, madam.

884
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,600
What's the vegetarian option?"

885
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,680
"You take the meat...

886
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,720
out of the bun."

887
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,240
A hundred times I told Daddy:

888
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,400
"Do not eat the meat in a bun."

889
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,760
Did he listen? Did he--
Fuck. He was like:

890
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,600
"I've eaten lunch every day at 1:00 p.m.
my entire life,

891
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,560
today will be no exception.
Go find me a wine list."

892
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,200
"Wine list? Daddy, we're in a canteen
in Chernobyl, there is no wine list.

893
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,120
Even if there was, I don't think
you'd want to go anywhere near."

894
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,240
"Would sir like the red, white,
or glow-in-the-dark?"

895
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,120
"Uh... red, please.
Could you suggest a good year?"

896
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,840
"Anything before 1986."

897
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,520
I was like: "Daddy,
you're not having any wine.

898
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,240
Just... have a glass of water."

899
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,360
He went: "I don't drink water." "Why?"

900
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,800
"Because fish fuck in it."

901
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,360
So he doesn't drink any water.
He eats the mystery "meat" in a bun.

902
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,640
Cut to 45 minutes later.

903
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
We're in a van with our camera crew.

904
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,960
We are driving past the exclusion zone
towards Pripyat,

905
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,640
into the deserted woodlands,

906
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,120
the most toxic and radioactive place
on earth,

907
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,280
when all of a sudden,

908
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,320
my father turns to me
and whispers in my ear:

909
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,240
"Jack, I need the toilet."

910
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,080
I turn to look at him,
and he does not look in a good way.

911
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,400
Seriously, I have not seen him
this red in the face

912
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,880
since I told him there was
a Women's World Cup.

913
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,560
I'm like: "Daddy, you can't go
to the toilet, you missed your chance,

914
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,040
we are now
in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere."

915
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,400
He grabbed my arm,

916
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,880
and in a voice that sounded like
he had been possessed by a demon,

917
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,680
he goes: "Stop this van!"

918
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,800
I've never seen my dad partake
in physical exercise in his entire life.

919
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,160
He literally ripped open the door
to this van,

920
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,760
and he ran into the woods
like he was Usain fucking Bolt.

921
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,360
I turned to the camera crew, I'm like:
"Hide behind the van.

922
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,200
I will go and deal with this."

923
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,840
I follow my father into the woods,
past these signs.

924
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,160
"Danger, do not trespass." "Radiation."

925
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,560
You're constantly told in Chernobyl

926
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,640
that you cannot touch or lean
on any surface,

927
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,800
for fear of radiation poisoning.

928
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,960
Therefore, as I enter the woods,
it becomes very clear very quickly

929
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,560
that the only way
that my 79-year-old father

930
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,160
is going to be able to relieve himself
in the woods...

931
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,720
is with my assistance.

932
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,360
Oh, you may grimace.
I had to live through this experience.

933
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,880
My father pulls down the trousers
of his three-piece suit.

934
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,120
I take him in both hands...

935
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,480
I tread on the tops of his feet,

936
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,560
and at the same time,
we both start to slowly lean back...

937
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,960
like we're doing some horrible
tantric yoga pose.

938
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,760
I can't look at him,
I have to go to a happy place.

939
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,360
I start humming a tune.

940
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,520
I'm broken from my happy place
by the sound of barking.

941
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,120
I open my eyes.
One of these feral, radioactive dogs

942
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,400
is advancing towards my father's arse,
thinking: "Mmm, lunchtime!"

943
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,480
I'm trying to scare this thing away.

944
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,080
I'm like: "Shoo, shoo,
please just leave us alone."

945
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,920
My dad's shouting as well:
"This is so fucking undignified."

946
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,880
I think it's when the coachload
of Japanese tourists drove past...

947
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,840
that I must have gone into a fugue state.

948
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,960
That is not a side of my father
that I want to see.

949
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,400
The next thing that I remember
is coming to,

950
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,760
walking towards this van,

951
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,640
thinking: "I'm never going to be able
to look Daddy in the eye ever again."

952
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,280
I call the camera crew out
from their hiding place.

953
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,280
First comes our director,
then our cameraman.

954
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,880
The third person to emerge was Marc,
our sound engineer.

955
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,080
He also had a haunted look on his face.

956
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,080
It's at that point that I realize that
throughout the entire ordeal in the woods,

957
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,800
we had been wearing microphones.

958
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,240
Then, as if it couldn't get any worse,

959
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,480
the crunch of tires on gravel,
an armored vehicle pulls up.

960
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,440
And from that armored vehicle
emerged three armed members

961
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,120
of the Ukrainian military police.

962
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,480
They assess the scene,
they see my father's ashen face,

963
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,520
they see the signs
that we have completely ignored,

964
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,840
and they see the site of Chernobyl's
second worst ever nuclear fallout.

965
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,800
They do not look best pleased.

966
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,360
It's at that point that I think quickly
and I intervene.

967
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,520
I'm like: "Gentlemen,
before you say anything,

968
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,880
can I just point out
that I have read all of the signs here,

969
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,680
and nowhere can I see one that says,

970
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:31,400
'Would you please refrain from entering
the woods with active diarrhea.'"

971
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,080
[yelling] Wembley,
you've been absolutely amazing.

972
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,520
Thank you very much.
I've been Jack Whitehall, good night.

973
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,000
[medical monitor beeping]

974
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,800
[man] I don't know
why you're fucking smirking.

975
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,760
-We've ended up in hospital in Chernobyl.
-[beeping continues]

976
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:19,000
[indistinct chatter]

977
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,120
I look like
I'm being basted for Christmas.

978
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,200
[Jack whispering] Why're they lined up?
You're not Prince Charles.

979
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,120
I would like to thank you all very much
for looking after me so well.

980
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,760
[woman translating]

981
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,520
And I will always have very fond memories
of this hospital,

982
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,840
and of you three for looking after me.
