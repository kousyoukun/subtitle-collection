1
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,133
Something odd happened a few weeks ago.

2
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:54,600
In the paper bin,
along with some TV guides,

3
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,433
I found a little girl's diary.

4
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,233
It was in green ink,
so I wrote it off as uninteresting.

5
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:07,433
I took it thinking I'd fill the blank pages

6
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,100
with something useful.

7
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,500
I began reading it,

8
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,667
got used to the dreamy handwriting,

9
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,833
and noted that it actually was interesting.

10
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,467
It wasn't the story that struck me

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,167
but the mysterious reticence it conveyed.

12
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,200
As if some things had been left out,

13
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,100
yet were oppressively present.

14
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,700
In the trivial man I easily identify with,

15
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,867
the trivial facts evoked
a newfound intensity

16
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,833
far beyond the quality of the lines.

17
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:57,167
I was truly disappointed when a page ended.

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,800
I wanted all I felt to emerge.

19
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,667
Or just more lines of rambling innocence

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,233
for me to ponder on.

21
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:18,867
She just stopped writing, without warning

22
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,833
and without saying she was done.

23
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:25,433
Did she find a better diary, a better life?

24
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:29,133
I kept the diary and continued writing it.

25
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,167
Because I liked that life.

26
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,667
What follows
was inspired by a true story.

27
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,733
The true story was inspired by a lie.

28
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,400
The lie is rather uninspired.

29
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,467
The following images are graphic.

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,367
A family tragedy occurred
today in Spinaceto.

31
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,433
It appears that the parents of a small baby

32
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,800
killed her by drowning her in the bath.

33
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:05,367
They then leapt from the balcony
of their room

34
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,567
and perished.

35
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,100
The young couple had boxes

36
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,233
of anxiolytics and spasmolytics.

37
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
Other guests

38
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,767
had heard the parents arguing

39
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,600
and threatening to commit suicide.

40
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,667
No one intervened...

41
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:28,500
We've launched a new
soap for sensitive skin.

42
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,633
A mild, foaming product.

43
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,333
I was involved

44
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,467
in the idea and its creation.

45
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,333
Not to mention the new range of shampoo.

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,867
Special no-tear shampoos
for kids' little eyes.

47
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,133
The job might sound stressful.

48
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:54,233
But you gotta break
through that glass ceiling.

49
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,467
Or what's the fucking point of living?

50
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,500
"Want to sell sugar water
for the rest of your life

51
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,800
or come with me and change the world?"

52
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,467
Steve Jobs. What a man!

53
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,267
I read his book. Mindblowing stuff!

54
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,567
All I can afford to read now are job ads.

55
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:18,167
- What kind of job are you after?
- Any job.

56
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,333
Anything suitable, because...

57
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:23,533
I've been idle for months.

58
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,533
It's bad for the mind.

59
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,833
You're not idle.
You're always on the move.

60
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,300
Where? At home.

61
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,433
I'm a stay-at-home dad.

62
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,633
You're the breadwinner.

63
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,867
Right, let's talk about something nice.

64
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,800
Kids, get your report cards.

65
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,667
They got great report cards.

66
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,600
Over there, over there.

67
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,833
You start.

68
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,100
Italian, A+. English, A+.

69
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,600
Second European Language, A+.
History, A+.

00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,133

Science, A+. Technology, A+.

72
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,667

73
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,867
Behavior, A+.

74
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,467
All A pluses.

75
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,133
Italian, A+. English, A+.

76
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:47,300
History, A+.

77
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,500
Geography, A+.

78
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,367
Math, A+. Science, A+.

79
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:57,667
Technology, A+.
Music, A+. Art, A+.

80
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,133
Physical Education, A+.

81
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,567
Behavior... A.

82
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:13,167
Viola needs to put in a little more effort.

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,133
She's lacking here and there,

84
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,400
but we're working on it.

85
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,867
Her support teacher's a dickhead.

86
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,100
- Pietro!
- Well, not a dickhead, he's dumb.

87
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:29,100
Good with disabled kids,
but not normal ones.

88
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,600
You're right, he is a bit dumb.

89
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,567
What a mess.

90
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,100
I used to like yard sales.

91
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,700
But lately they've become lame.

92
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,333
Neighbors sell the same boring old stuff.

93
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,800
Nothing sells. You just get sunburn.

94
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,867
How much is this?

95
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,467
Like, a ton of money.

96
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,133
How much you got?

97
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,667
Nothing.

98
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,633
Not enough.

99
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:16,333
Yeah, but how much is it?

100
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,633
30 euros.

101
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,267
- Dad, can I have 30 euros?
- Huh?

102
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,567
- Can I have 30 euros?
- What for?

103
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,600
An educational thing.

104
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,733
Ask your mom.

105
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,633
Mom, can I have 30 euros?

106
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:47,133
Since we've sold a few things...

107
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,800
- Bring me the change.
- Okay.

108
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,233
I'm not really sure it costs 30 euros.

109
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,200
Might be worth way more.

110
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,400
I'll go ask Mom.

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,333
Hey, Mom...

112
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,233
How much is that thing?

113
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,433
That metal... detector?

114
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,533
15 euros.

115
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,767
So...

116
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,800
since you got a lot left over,

117
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,833
you wanna...?

118
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:24,767
Go fuck yourself.

119
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:33,433
Hey, boy! You'll feel better soon.

120
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,200
It'd be easier if they
didn't say "put down."

121
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,433
"Pacify".

122
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,600
No... "repacify."

123
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,167
No, wait... Geremia!

124
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,667
Have a minute with him.

125
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,400
Say goodbye to Woofie. Say goodbye.

126
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,633
C'mon, say bye to him!

127
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,833
Geremia, don't be like that.

128
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:59,533
This disease, it messes with his head.

129
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:04,100
He knows you said bye and love him.
Trust me.

130
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
C'mon.

131
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,767
He came around.
Remember how he was?

132
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,533
Always miserable. That rascal!

133
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,867
Look at him! He's crying!

134
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,867
Rabies beats depression, you bet!

135
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:37,333
Woofie, I'm taking you on a vacation!

136
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,300
I'll be back in two hours at the most.

137
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,767
I'll pick up some pizza.
Want a bruschetta?

138
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Play soccer, stay here. Don't worry.

139
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,367
Let's go, Woofie!

140
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,167
Mom!

141
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,833
We're out of that fucking sauce!

142
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,367
You're out of your mind.

143
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,467
It's the teachers'
lounge, so it's mine too.

144
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,233
So it's the only fridge I have at work.

145
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:02,100
I don't have to share the food I put in it.

146
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:18,467
Otherwise you can't bring food from home

147
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,567
and have to keep feeding coins
into the vending machine.

148
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,333
I mean, come on!

149
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,633
Guerrini! Hey, spaz, what's up?

150
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,400
They need me at the trattoria.
I'm going now.

151
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:22,300
My first year in middle school ended today.

152
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,833
Our summer reading:

153
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,267
The Canterville Ghost.

154
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,600
I didn't tell anyone I'd already read it.

155
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:36,100
I have plenty to do this summer. Maybe
I'll even fall in love like last year.

156
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,500
Hey, asshole...

157
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,167
Move your feet.

158
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,333
Can I have one?

159
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,567
Okay.

160
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,300
It's good.

161
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,800
C'mon, laugh.

162
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,467
When's it due?

163
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,833
In two months.

164
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,400
But...

165
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:33,200
are you really sure you want a baby?

166
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,533
Oh, fuck it.

167
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,733
How did the flute lesson go?

168
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:59,633
It seemed a bit...

169
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,500
thrown together.

170
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,700
The hall wasn't equipped.

171
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,733
We waited an hour for the teacher.

172
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:09,833
He showed up late.

173
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,733
Great.

174
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,300
So we'll switch then.

175
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,833
Right?

176
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,800
They offer lots of classes.

177
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,467
And it's good for the kids...

178
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,167
to learn lots of different things.

179
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,700
To learn to be flexible.

180
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:37,100
The first lesson's free anyway, right?

181
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,567
Dennis?

182
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,267
Spit it out.

183
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,467
Here, have a sip of water.

184
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,733
- Bruno, he's choking.
- Here, drink this.

185
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
He's choking on the meat!

186
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,733
What the fuck am I meant to do?

187
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,700
Spit it out. Spit it out!

188
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,867
- He's choking!
- What the fuck? Spit it out!

189
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Spit it out!

190
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,833
Are you okay, sweetie?

191
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,367
Jesus!

192
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,700
No, stop.

193
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,267
Alessia...

194
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,333
Alessia, calm down.

195
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,100
Hey!

196
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,367
He's okay, c'mon.

197
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,333
What happened?

198
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,533
What happened?

199
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,567
C'mon now!

200
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,167
C'mon, everything's fine.

201
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,700
C'mon.

202
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,800
C'mon, dear, calm down.

203
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,633
C'mon on, let's eat.

204
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,100
I'm hungry.

205
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,633
What the fuck was that about?

206
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,133
C'mon, don't piss me off!

207
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,667
Let's eat.

208
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,667
Okay, then.

209
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,600
We can't even eat a fucking steak...

210
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:18,667
in peace now!

211
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,667
Fucked up world.

212
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,267
See what you did?

213
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,767
You made your dad cry.

214
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,333
We went to the free beach.

215
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,400
Dad said we go to the beach to be
in the sea.

216
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,800
The sea's the same for rich and poor.

217
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,400
But he was the one who didn't enjoy it.

218
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,133
What about your baby?

219
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,133
Had her.

220
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,433
But she's in the hospital. In an incubator.

221
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,333
Gonna get her at the end of summer.

222
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:37,267
It's almost hot.

223
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,867
Here we are!

224
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,400
A big hearty snack for everyone. Dig in.

225
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,133
Good kids, studying on summer vacation.

226
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,267
Every mother's dream.

227
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,633
What are you doing?

228
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:44,500
Finishing this project
before school starts.

229
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:46,700
There's watermelon too.

230
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:50,333
Don't eat the seeds,
they'll grow in your belly.

231
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,500
See you later.

232
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:56,767
Dad got a pool on sale.

233
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,367
We put it in the yard.

234
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:02,233
A cheap alternative to a normal summer.

235
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,133
Lots of people were in our situation,

236
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:13,300
so our pool and yard became
the neighborhood's pool and yard.

237
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,433
Bruno!

238
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,667
Me and Susanna, we're so grateful.

239
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,533
- I'm swamped at work.
- No sweat.

240
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,100
And I know the kids are safe here.

241
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:29,167
No sweat. Don't mention it.

242
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:32,733
I'm here for my daughter. You seen her?

243
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:35,200
Uh...

244
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,833
There she is.

245
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,633
Get your flip-flops on.

246
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,233
Let's go.

247
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,400
- Thank Uncle Bruno.
- Thank you.

248
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,700
That fucking pool and shithole house.

249
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,533
Take it easy, Pietro.

250
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,300
I won't fucking take it easy, Susanna.
I won't!

251
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,800
Where did she get them if not from there?

252
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,833
That pool, that pool...

253
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,367
Head lice.

254
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,167
That family of cheapskate,
communist leeches!

255
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:13,133
You... you look beautiful.

256
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,467
This morning we woke up to terrible news.

257
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:54,867
Someone wrecked the pool with a pickaxe.

258
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,600
Dennis and I stared in dismay at the pool.
It was gouged beyond repair.

259
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,567
Dad had to make us snap out of it.

260
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,733
I wish I had his mettle.

261
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:09,333
Human cruelty doesn't shock him anymore.

262
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:14,767
You buy a pool, let others use it

263
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:18,200
and get screwed over by jealous people.

264
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:21,733
Dad said it must've been gypsies.

265
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:23,733
Gypsies with pickaxes.

266
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,167
Gypsies without swimming pools.

267
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,633
Done.

268
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,867
Pietro... Take down the balloons outside.

269
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:50,333
It took me half an hour to put them up.

270
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:54,167
But if Viola sees them when she gets back

271
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,100
it won't be a surprise party.

272
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:55,267
HAPPY BIRTHDAY VIOLA

273
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,333
Read it. Go on.

274
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:06,100
"Very best wishes from the Placido family."

275
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,400
It's beautiful.

276
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,500
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

277
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,567
Alessia chose it.

278
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,667
There you go.

279
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,633
Over there, Bruno. Get in the picture.

280
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:48,267
- Me?
- C'mon, it's nice. The whole family.

281
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,733
Smile, all together.

282
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,667
Huddle up.

283
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,700
That's good. Hold on.

284
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:01,867
Sorry.

285
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:08,400
She's not wearing underwear.
Look carefully.

286
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,100
With that asshole...

287
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:13,767
She could milk a cock dry with that ass.

288
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:18,267
- That dress she's wearing.
- It's on purpose.

289
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,700
She did it on purpose.

290
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:24,467
I'd slice it off her from below!

291
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,800
Creampie your face.

292
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:37,133
You whore, I'll fucking show you.

293
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,367
I'll stick it in her mouth.

294
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,367
Do it without a damn word.

295
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:45,700
Just stick it in her mouth.

296
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,233
I'll get her alone. I don't give a fuck.

297
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,733
I'll even do it tonight.

298
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,867
It'd only take us a second.

299
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,433
Just look at how she acts.

300
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:01,767
Fuck you laughing at, you slut?

301
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,367
Want some fun?

302
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,800
All those cocks banging
her ass every night!

303
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:10,800
HISTORY

304
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,333
COLLEAGUE FUCKED AND JIZZED ON

305
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:15,567
ASS FUCKED AFTER SHOWER...

306
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,100
Doesn't your dad notice you go through it?

307
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:27,767
I tell him it has a
better camera than mine.

308
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,700
If I ask him he lets me use it.

309
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,233
But we're having sex at
least once too, right?

310
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,433
Then we'll have done everything.

311
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,300
Okay... okay.

312
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,667
Any free time this week?

313
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:01,367
Between Wednesday and Friday?

314
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,100
So you like giving blow jobs?

315
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:40,867
It's better to turn up at the end.

316
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,100
Trust me, I know these parties.

317
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:48,867
Girls invited me nearly every week.

318
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,400
They kept inviting me.

319
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,567
Some I went to, others I didn't.

320
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,433
Depending on whose party it was.

321
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,600
They were delighted when they saw me.

322
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:05,400
They didn't mind me not bringing gifts.

323
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,767
I was the gift.

324
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,667
Know what a guy at work said to me today?

325
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,133
That I look like Antonio Banderas.

326
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:20,133
The one in the commercial with the hens.

327
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,767
Imagine that!

328
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,167
So what if we don't go to this party?

329
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,667
We'll pick up sandwiches
with ham and cheese.

330
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,733
I'm starving. To hell with them!

331
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,633
I don't even like them.

332
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,500
Especially the little girl. She's strange.

333
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:07,233
- Yes!
- Well done!

334
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,133
Hey, ace.

335
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,767
Hot, isn't it?

336
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,433
Come in.

337
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,300
Sit down here.

338
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,833
Sorry...

339
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,567
the place is a mess.

340
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,367
Don't you ever stop working?

341
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,233
Just tutoring a couple of blockheads.

342
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,767
Easy money.

343
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,333
What about you?

344
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:48,300
Never cutting me any slack.

345
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:50,700
Homework in August?

346
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:55,767
No, It's the same old topic. Just that...

347
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,600
I still don't quite get it.

348
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:02,233
Thank God. Or you'd be a genius.

349
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,633
And geniuses lead crappy lives.

350
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:09,667
Show me what you've got there.

351
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,100
Some stuff I don't get.

352
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,733
Okay.

353
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,867
We'll go over this now.

354
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:24,167
But this afternoon you go stare
at the girls in their swimsuits.

355
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,833
That's my boy!

356
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Go on, that's right!

357
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,133
Go on!

358
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:50,233
Look at that!
You're flying!

359
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:51,833
Great!

360
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,567
Go on!

361
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:01,167
Look at that son of a bitch!

362
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,600
You take after me, damn it! You hear?

363
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:06,433
You take after me!

364
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,533
You take after me!

365
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,333
Good boy!

366
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,500
Yeah!

367
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:15,700
You take after me! You got that?

368
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,500
Fuck yeah! Great!

369
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,633
Goddamn it! You're so fucking good at it!

370
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:24,333
Yeah!

371
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:25,867
Fuck!

372
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,600
Yeah!

373
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:30,667
Come here, damn you!

374
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:46,733
How do you feel?

375
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
Better?

376
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,467
Damn.

377
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,167
I have leftovers.

378
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,733
They were going to the dog.

379
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:09,333
I said, "Forget the dog. I've got a kid."

380
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:14,700
Wanna eat in here or at the table with me?

381
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:21,667
Don't worry. Leave it to me, okay?

382
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,200
Mushrooms and sausage.

383
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,567
Smells amazing.

384
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,800
Look here.

385
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,167
Eat up.

386
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,567
I've got some more good news.

387
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,400
I ran into that girl's
mother, you know who.

388
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,833
The one whose party we were going to.

389
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:57,500
She heard you got measles.

390
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:01,400
She was glad. Her daughter hasn't had 'em.

391
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:03,833
She says this is the best chance.

392
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:06,533
Her friends' kids had 'em.

393
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,800
No one can help her.

394
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:12,100
We'll plan a nice afternoon here.

395
00:42:12,233 --> 00:42:14,500
She'll bring her daughter by.

396
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:18,433
You hang with her, she gets the measles.

397
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:21,233
You get your chance. Happy?

398
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:26,267
You nearly missed out with that scowl.

399
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:29,233
Have a piece of pizza for Dad.

400
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,467
C'mon, have some with me.

401
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:01,767
I really feel like fucking.

402
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:14,833
They got stuck in traffic.

403
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:17,167
They'll be here soon.

404
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Here they are. Get up.

405
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,767
Yeah, it's them. They're here.

406
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,600
Wave.

407
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,800
Smile.

408
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,700
Smile!

409
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:52,433
Go, say hello to the girl. Go on.

410
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,733
Lovely ladies!

411
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,633
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

412
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,533
- How are you?
- Good.

413
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,433
- How nice! Cookies?
- Hi.

414
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:08,700
- No, a cake.
- A cake!

415
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,833
- I've already had measles.
- Me too!

416
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:15,467
This is a cake I baked. It turned out good.

417
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,600
So I brought half.

418
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:20,867
I've got ice cream, but I prefer cake.

419
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,767
- As you prefer.
- Of course.

420
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,467
- Okay.
- Right, let's go in.

421
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
- Let's go.
- This way.

422
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,167
This is my home.

423
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:35,433
And his too. Our home, that is.

424
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:38,500
- We're out in the country.
- Lovely.

425
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:42,167
Dad planted the trees. He died a year ago.

426
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,767
- Sorry.
- He planted that when I was born.

427
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,467
We're renovating. The bricks'll go soon.

428
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,433
We have two entrances.
We'll take this one.

429
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:55,300
- Come in.
- Okay.

430
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:58,633
- Let's leave them. We're boring.
- True.

431
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:02,500
- Can you hold the cake a moment?
- Of course.

432
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,867
Geremia, come here a sec.

433
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:12,433
There's protection in the shoe rack.

434
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:14,267
Just in case...

435
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,500
Please, make yourself at home.

436
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,367
- How beautiful!
- Later, Viola.

437
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,167
- She's so beautiful!
- Yes.

438
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:27,400
Mommy's darling.

439
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:31,667
- It's all on one floor. To the right.
- Okay.

440
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,867
- Thanks.
- You're alone?

441
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,767
Yes, yes.

442
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,467
- Yes, my husband...
- Put it on the bananas.

443
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,200
Okay.

444
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,733
- Wanna do it now?
- Now...

445
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,233
What time is it now?

446
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:59,533
Dunno, about four.

447
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:03,100
- All right.
- Should I lie down?

448
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:04,767
I think so.

449
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:19,700
Damn, it's scorching.

450
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,833
Come here.

451
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:28,267
- Gonna get undressed?
- If you say so.

452
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:07,800
Okay, listen...

453
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:10,267
This won't work.

454
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:13,200
I'm not used to this.

455
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,200
It's just very weird.

456
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,300
It's all very weird.

457
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,600
Tell you what...

458
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:24,700
You stay here.
I'll go behind there a minute.

459
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:27,300
I'll focus, I'll calm down.

460
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:30,200
And I'll come back ready to roll, okay?

461
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,733
Okay.

462
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,200
Why don't you wear your wig like this?

463
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,800
Like what?

464
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:35,133
Here, like this. No, wait.

465
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,667
There, like this.

466
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,500
You're still beautiful.

467
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,767
Of course, I know.

468
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,700
Think you already infected me?

469
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,433
Dunno.

470
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:01,433
Dunno if know if I can.

471
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:05,333
C'mon, don't be so selfish. Give it to me.

472
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,767
Give it to me!

473
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,733
It's nice when you smile.

474
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:13,533
Then the measles can get out and into me.

475
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,533
Or I'll kiss you.

476
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:19,433
I'll get it over with and go home with Mom.

477
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:21,400
What's it gonna be?

478
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:24,833
I'm fine even if you just keep me company.

479
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,733
It makes me feel good.

480
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:00,400
You reading my palm?

481
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,800
- Yes.
- What does it say?

482
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,533
None of your damn business.

483
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,533
Bye! Drive carefully!

484
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,467
Drive slowly! See you soon!

485
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:22,333
So? How did it go?

486
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,467
Look what you won, little man.

487
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,867
A beer. Let's have a drink.

488
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:55,300
Do you realize how strange life is?

489
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:57,800
I'd have banged her mom,

490
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:59,467
but I couldn't.

491
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,433
She talked about her
husband's job and shit.

492
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,800
You had fun and that's plenty for me.

493
00:52:07,767 --> 00:52:10,700
That's what matters to your dad.

494
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:14,533
If you didn't know that
already, you do now.

495
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:17,533
C'mon, let's toast!

496
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:22,500
To this fucking summer!

497
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:50,300
Hey, dimwit, two minutes and I'm off.

498
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:40,433
I'm usually anxious at the end of vacation.

499
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:43,600
I count down time while trying to stop it

500
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:45,800
up until the night before.

501
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,800
But the day still arrives.

502
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,267
Dad opens the door shouting, "Wake up!"

503
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,200
This year I wasn't anxious

504
00:53:57,333 --> 00:54:00,600
and didn't do any kind of countdown.

505
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:02,833
I just watched a movie.

506
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:06,300
I think Dennis and I had cooled down.

507
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:07,867
We matured.

508
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,133
Our dads just woke us up.

509
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:14,233
Damn you! Asshole!

510
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,633
Cocksucker! Damn you! Fuck you!

511
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:21,133
I waited half an hour!

512
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,633
Don't you have a car?

513
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:47,567
They took my license away.

514
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,200
Why?

515
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,533
You making a pass at me, kid?

516
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,400
How d'you think you're doing?

517
00:54:57,533 --> 00:54:59,267
Awesome.

518
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:01,267
Get bent.

519
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,433
Listen, if I tell you a secret

520
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,800
will you promise not to tell anyone?

521
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,700
Like that you're a fag?

522
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,867
No, really.

523
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:27,667
What is it?

524
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,667
I'm making a bomb

525
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,567
to blow up the whole neighborhood.

526
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,700
Then it'll all be over.

527
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,500
But I'm not just working on the project.

528
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:44,767
I'm the one making the decisions.

529
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,500
Get the fuck outta here!

530
00:56:04,867 --> 00:56:07,267
I'm telling you because of your baby...

531
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,333
Shut the fuck up!

532
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:27,433
I'm off to work.

533
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:30,700
Your cousin called.
She's coming by later.

534
00:58:54,667 --> 00:59:00,500
The kid was making a bomb at his house,
in his bedroom.

535
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:03,467
He kept it there.

536
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:08,733
They say they called in the bomb squad.

537
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:11,800
They took it all away.

538
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,200
But it was very dangerous.

539
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:18,833
Everyone was in danger,

540
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:22,300
not just the family.

541
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,300
I'm at a loss for words.

542
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:30,133
I've heard he's a kind of...

543
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:33,433
that he's strange, like disabled.

544
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:35,567
Yeah, I'm speechless.

545
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,633
Yeah, if you consider that this kid

546
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:47,200
actually kept a bomb on his bedroom desk.

547
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,200
Just like that!

548
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:54,833
And his father said he knew
nothing about it.

549
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,800
He said he never even noticed.

550
00:59:58,133 --> 00:59:59,533
Because...

551
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:02,667
his son told him...

552
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,800
he needed it for his school project.

553
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:15,300
You're right, we're all speechless.

554
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,467
Dalila?

555
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:23,700
- Dalila?
- Sorry, I have to go.

556
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,867
I have a business call.

557
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,667
Bye. Bye.

558
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:54,167
I'm going out for a few rounds.

559
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:08,400
- Do you trust me?
- Sure... shouldn't I?

560
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:16,100
Yukari!

561
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:20,600
Those are your friends? No way!

562
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:24,167
Sorry, Tommy, but I only saw him, and...

563
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,167
But that's Oscar, my alien friend.

564
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,200
An alien? But he's not small and green.

565
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:33,300
The young ones are. I was once.

566
01:01:33,433 --> 01:01:36,600
He's amazing. Why are you down here?

567
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:39,500
It all began an hour ago.

568
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:44,233
I had just started training in the park...

569
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,667
Caligula! Where are you?

570
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,533
What's wrong, Mom?

571
01:01:50,633 --> 01:01:53,633
Nothing, Alessia. Be quiet a sec.

572
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:57,667
My period. Mommy's got her period.

573
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,667
Listen, Mommy's sick of cooking today.

574
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:19,333
Go see a movie and get some popcorn.

575
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,600
- Go.
- A hundred euros?

576
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:24,133
Go on, move it! Go on.

577
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:00,833
How was the movie? Good?

578
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,100
Was it?

579
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,400
Good kids.

580
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:09,267
Listen, feel like going for a ride?

581
01:04:10,467 --> 01:04:12,833
Dad doesn't feel like going home yet.

582
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:15,400
No, please, I'm tired.

583
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:19,433
- And we have school tomorrow.
- You do?

584
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,267
Of course.

585
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,600
Well, it's Dad's decision.

586
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:28,333
We're going for a ride anyway.

587
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:47,367
Dad?

588
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:51,367
Can I ask you something?

589
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,667
What's that, Dennis?

590
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,200
Well...

591
01:04:57,333 --> 01:05:00,133
you and Mom, I mean...

592
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,500
are you okay?

593
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:04,233
I mean...

594
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,600
is everything all right between you?

595
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:51,567
Get out.

596
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,600
- Get out.
- No, Dad!

597
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:56,300
Alessia, I'm talking to Dennis.

598
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:58,633
Get out, Dennis. Get out!

599
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:02,633
Come on!

600
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:04,367
Come on.

601
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,367
Say that again!

602
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:15,433
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

603
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:18,467
Here's how things are between me and Mom.

604
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,433
Come here! Come here! Come here!

605
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:25,567
How are things between us?

606
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,267
How are things? Goddamn motherfucker!

607
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:40,167
Come here!

608
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,367
Get up! I didn't fucking touch you!

609
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,633
A piece of shit, that's what you are!

610
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,333
Get in and shut up! Don't even breathe!

611
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,100
Me and Mom are fine!

612
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:06,367
Me and Mom!

613
01:07:07,767 --> 01:07:10,467
Nothing to say, Alessia?

614
01:07:23,533 --> 01:07:27,567
One peep and there'll be trouble!
No crying!

615
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,167
I'm the one who should be crying here!

616
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:49,400
Today we went to the country. How strange.

617
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:53,333
It wasn't Sunday, Saturday, or a holiday.

618
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,300
We said nothing because we wanted to go.

619
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,533
As usual, I got car sick,

620
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:03,800
but as soon as I got out I felt better.

621
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,600
I felt good on that lovely green grass.

622
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,567
But Dad had a toothache
that didn't go away.

623
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,267
You should be happy to
have parents like us.

624
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,300
You should be really happy.

625
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,233
Understand?

626
01:08:47,233 --> 01:08:49,833
Because it's normal for things

627
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:53,233
to not always go the way you'd like.

628
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:54,700
Okay?

629
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:57,533
Even Mommy, when she was little

630
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,800
and lived with Grandma,

631
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:03,300
wasn't allowed to do lots of stuff

632
01:09:03,433 --> 01:09:05,833
and wanted to leave home.

633
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,267
Alessia!

634
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,800
Mom!

635
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,133
Where is everyone?

636
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:42,100
Dennis?

637
01:09:43,633 --> 01:09:45,233
Mom?

638
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,833
Dad?

639
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,333
You're the best father I know.

640
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:09,300
And you're the best mother I know.

641
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,567
I like to eat just the crust too. Look.

642
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,667
Like this. You take it all off. Try it.

643
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:32,700
Okay?

644
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:45,400
So, I decided to take
you out of that school.

645
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,633
There's a lot of turmoil there.

646
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,233
New house, new school, new city.
We move on.

647
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,867
So no school for you
while I find a new job.

648
01:11:02,433 --> 01:11:05,667
I'd head to Rome. What do you say?

649
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:09,233
It's a pain in the ass living out here.

650
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,800
All self-righteous and backwards.

651
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:14,867
A bunch of shitheads.

652
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:22,233
I can ask my cousin...

653
01:11:22,733 --> 01:11:25,467
in Casal Bruciato if he can put us up.

654
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,367
We'll share the bed in the living room.

655
01:11:30,367 --> 01:11:32,233
It'll be a riot!

656
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:35,533
Remember when we used to do it every night?

657
01:11:36,533 --> 01:11:38,300
What a blast.

658
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:41,733
Kick-ass.

659
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,433
Hi.

660
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,633
You going away too?

661
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:07,433
Yeah.

662
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,100
I found this in a bag of chips.

663
01:12:38,267 --> 01:12:40,400
It's yours. It's a gift.

664
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:56,600
Okay. Bye.

665
01:12:58,867 --> 01:13:00,733
Hey? Hey!

666
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:06,467
Let's go and get some meat and fruit.

667
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,533
Let's go.

668
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:15,533
Whatcha got there? Lemme see.

669
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,467
What is this crap? Lose it.

670
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,467
C'mon, let's go.

671
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,400
C'mon! Get a move on.

672
01:13:35,867 --> 01:13:37,667
Come in, please.

673
01:13:39,633 --> 01:13:42,133
- Nice sunny day, isn't it?
- Hello.

674
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:44,567
- Sit down.
- Hello.

675
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:54,233
Right then...

676
01:13:55,367 --> 01:13:59,367
I'm sure you've heard about
all the pressure

677
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,133
that has been directed towards us,

678
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:08,133
from both parents
and teachers at the school.

679
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,733
Although...

680
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,700
Although unintentionally,

681
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,200
you taught the students

682
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,833
what they later put into practice.

683
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,300
- I'm talking about the two bombs.
- Precisely!

684
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,400
How was I to know the kid was nuts?

685
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:33,633
If his parents didn't notice, how could I?

686
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:37,267
Unfortunately,
the situation that has arisen

687
01:14:37,867 --> 01:14:41,567
means we have no choice
but to replace you.

688
01:14:43,433 --> 01:14:45,300
- Really?
- Yes.

689
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,567
Well, don't think you've upset me.

690
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,300
"Oh my God!

691
01:14:52,433 --> 01:14:56,133
Fired by this school of bungling idiots!"

692
01:14:56,267 --> 01:14:57,867
And anyway,

693
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:01,267
the looks I got from everyone gave it away.

694
01:15:01,567 --> 01:15:04,567
So there's no need to act all haughty.

695
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,767
It's how things stand. Now please go.

696
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,200
We have many people to see this morning.

697
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,433
Of course, I see.

698
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:23,333
Could I at least teach today's class?

699
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:26,767
Of course.

700
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:43,867
Good morning.

701
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:34,233
Is that our daughter crying?

702
01:16:35,533 --> 01:16:37,833
No, can't you tell it's a dog?

703
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,533
No, it sounds like our daughter.

704
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:45,300
Already a bitch.

705
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,633
You're such an asshole!

706
01:16:50,433 --> 01:16:52,100
Be serious.

707
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,500
I am being serious.

708
01:16:55,633 --> 01:16:57,533
You're her damn father.

709
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:59,667
And you're her mother.

710
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,600
We are being serious.

711
01:17:03,267 --> 01:17:06,233
We were right to leave that place.

712
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:11,600
She'd be a goner staying with your mom.

713
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,667
Yeah, yeah.

714
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,733
True. It's the first step though.

715
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:27,467
We gotta grow up, babe.

716
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,633
We'll grow up.

717
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,700
For once.

718
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:36,133
We can only grow up once.

719
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:38,767
All right.

720
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,200
We'll make plans tomorrow in Spinaceto.

721
01:17:42,767 --> 01:17:44,800
We'll check into a guesthouse.

722
01:17:45,133 --> 01:17:48,233
I know a second assistant pizza guy.

723
01:17:48,367 --> 01:17:51,100
He makes a ton of money, so I will too.

724
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,167
If you get bored, you can find an odd job.

725
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,567
You can work as a barista or waitress.

726
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,300
Like the idea? We'll have two incomes.

727
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,233
Then we can go dancing in Ibiza in summer.

728
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,367
Ibiza!

729
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,367
Ibiza, anywhere we want.

730
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,600
Anyway, babe...

731
01:18:21,267 --> 01:18:23,800
we have to go to the registry office.

732
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:26,333
We were wrong to name our baby

733
01:18:26,467 --> 01:18:28,700
after a Vasco Rossi song.

734
01:18:30,133 --> 01:18:32,600
Don't laugh, we both chose this name.

735
01:18:32,867 --> 01:18:35,300
We should've named her Sara.

736
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:39,133
- Like the Meneguzzi song, remember?
- Yeah.

737
01:18:39,267 --> 01:18:42,533
- That was our song.
- Yeah, okay.

738
01:18:47,467 --> 01:18:49,267
What the hell?

739
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,567
What the fuck!

740
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,500
What the fuck!

741
01:19:02,133 --> 01:19:03,667
In the sun

742
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,133
You decided to set off

743
01:19:07,267 --> 01:19:09,367
In search of a different life

744
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,733
To live

745
01:19:11,867 --> 01:19:13,400
Oh, Sara!

746
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:16,700
Walking towards the sun

747
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,867
Against the others, against everyone

748
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:25,333
You want to live every second of your life

749
01:19:25,467 --> 01:19:26,867
Vilma!

750
01:19:28,267 --> 01:19:30,733
You crying over the name?

751
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,867
Hey, we'll change the name.

752
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:38,867
Hey, Vilma.

753
01:20:31,433 --> 01:20:32,833
Hey.

754
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:37,833
Wake up, it's four o'clock.

755
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,433
- I need to use the toilet a sec.
- Okay.

756
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:36,700
Dennis.

757
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,433
Alessia.

758
01:24:05,133 --> 01:24:06,533
Alessia.

759
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:52,367
Kids.

760
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,800
Kids...

761
01:27:08,567 --> 01:27:10,833
Oh my God! Help!

762
01:27:12,467 --> 01:27:13,767
Help!

763
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,400
Oh, my God!

764
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:23,133
Bruno!

765
01:27:27,733 --> 01:27:29,267
Help!

766
01:27:32,367 --> 01:27:34,100
Oh, my God!

767
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,600
Help!

768
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,600
Bruno!

769
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:43,600
Oh, my God!

770
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,733
Bruno!

771
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:04,133
Strange I've never mentioned Malathion.

772
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,300
Because it's a very interesting subject.

773
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,733
Ma...

774
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,300
la...

775
01:28:15,433 --> 01:28:17,133
thion.

776
01:28:17,533 --> 01:28:19,133
Yes.

777
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,800
How many of you have a yard?

778
01:28:26,767 --> 01:28:28,700
All of you I bet, right?

779
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:31,833
I'm sure that your parents keep

780
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:35,167
a container of Malathion in the garage.

781
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,500
Malathion is a very powerful insecticide.

782
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:43,167
It helped us defeat the medfly in the '80s.

783
01:28:44,467 --> 01:28:47,567
It paralyzes the nerve structures

784
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,567
in mosquitoes and other insects

785
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,133
and eliminates the eggs of adult lice.

786
01:28:56,533 --> 01:28:59,867
Obviously, it is a very dangerous product.

787
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,700
An irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor,

788
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:08,300
it may be the most poisonous

789
01:29:08,433 --> 01:29:11,433
agricultural antiparasitic on the market.

790
01:29:12,233 --> 01:29:13,733
All the same...

791
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:17,200
it is freely available in any shop.

792
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,533
And it is very cheap too.

793
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,733
Ada?

794
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,267
Darling, wake up.

795
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:45,367
I'm going downstairs to work.

796
01:29:47,133 --> 01:29:49,433
I'll see you at lunch, okay?

797
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,767
The pages of the diary run out here.

798
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,300
At the end I wrote smaller and smaller,

799
01:30:11,433 --> 01:30:13,567
right up to the margins.

800
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,767
I was tempted to buy a
new diary to continue,

801
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,400
so I went to a stationer's

802
01:30:27,533 --> 01:30:30,300
and leafed through a few of them.

803
01:30:30,733 --> 01:30:34,367
They were excellent, quite cheap and blank.

804
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,200
But it didn't feel the same.

805
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:40,367
I didn't know what I would write in them.

806
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,533
I lacked inspiration.

807
01:30:44,433 --> 01:30:47,267
So I didn't buy a new diary.

808
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,867
I bought sports magazines,

809
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,867
resumed the monotony of soccer transfers,

810
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,500
slicing melons and cursing vacationers.

811
01:30:56,867 --> 01:30:58,200
That's what I did.

812
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,233
I advise you to do the same.

813
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,433
- Hey, buddy!
- Oh, man!

814
01:31:26,567 --> 01:31:28,233
Come here!

815
01:31:30,167 --> 01:31:33,633
Goddamn, you look terrific!

816
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:36,433
- What have you done?
- What?

817
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,500
- You balding?
- Stop!

818
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,300
Old man!

819
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,733
My washing machine's broken.
Rosaria's doing my laundry.

820
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:45,733
- She's not dead?
- She'll bury us all.

821
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:49,267
Look at this kid! You've gotten big!

822
01:31:49,367 --> 01:31:51,267
Give your uncle a kiss.

823
01:31:52,267 --> 01:31:55,400
Hey, c'mon now! Nice! Come inside.

824
01:31:56,167 --> 01:31:58,600
- Gimme your bag.
- Here you go.

825
01:31:58,733 --> 01:32:02,500
- You brought cookies?
- Yeah, from downstairs.

826
01:32:03,533 --> 01:32:06,267
I'm glad you're staying a while.

827
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,567
- Me too.
- I'll introduce you to the locals.

828
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,567
Go on, sit down.

829
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:14,633
- Remember them?
- Sure.

830
01:32:14,767 --> 01:32:16,367
Mimmo.

831
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,700
"The Prince," "the She-Wolf"!

832
01:32:22,433 --> 01:32:24,367
Listen... what about Omar?

833
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,833
Been gone two years.

834
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,367
He end up in the can?

835
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:31,767
Murdered. Got shot in the park nearby.

836
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,800
I didn't know that.

837
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,800
Don't mind the mess.

838
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,867
I couldn't clean 'cause I had a fever.

839
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,300
- Ignore it.
- No worries.

840
01:32:41,433 --> 01:32:45,233
I'll sleep here and you sleep in my room.

841
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,667
- No...
- I'm happy to.

842
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,800
Okay, I appreciate it.

843
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,333
We appreciate it, that is.

844
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,167
This lunatic was making a bomb on his own.

845
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,600
- All on his own.
- Smart kid.

846
01:33:00,733 --> 01:33:02,633
He takes after us.

847
01:33:08,567 --> 01:33:12,133
- Know where this kid can work?
- Where?

848
01:33:12,733 --> 01:33:14,433
At NASA.

849
01:33:16,233 --> 01:33:18,133
We got something like NASA here?

850
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,233
Of course, we must! We're not idiots.

851
01:33:23,867 --> 01:33:25,400
Okay.

852
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:27,367
Let's eat.

853
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,767
Mortadella, buffalo mozzarella,

854
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,533
and wine.

855
01:33:31,733 --> 01:33:34,167
To hell with our enemies!

856
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:38,267
- I love you, man.
- Love you too, big time.

857
01:33:39,633 --> 01:33:41,800
Great day we've had.

858
01:34:02,867 --> 01:34:06,267
We'll get up at seven tomorrow morning.

859
01:34:09,467 --> 01:34:12,667
We'll go look for a cheap grinder.

860
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:19,833
Then we'll go to your uncle's garage.

861
01:34:32,567 --> 01:34:36,333
First we'll have a cappuccino
and croissant.

862
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,233
At the café. Sound good?

863
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,300
Okay.

864
01:34:46,767 --> 01:34:48,367
Good night.

865
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,700
I feel guilty for telling this senseless,

866
01:34:57,833 --> 01:35:00,633
sad and even pessimistic story.

867
01:35:00,767 --> 01:35:03,433
Maybe you deserved a more realistic,

868
01:35:03,567 --> 01:35:06,500
normal, everyday type of story.

869
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,500
Not the ranting of someone bored with life.

870
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:12,667
I apologize.

871
01:35:13,867 --> 01:35:16,367
Let's start from scratch.

872
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:33,233
- Too loud? Should I turn it down?
- No.

873
01:35:33,767 --> 01:35:35,433
I can't sleep.

874
01:35:35,567 --> 01:35:38,100
The following images are graphic.

875
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:41,767
A family tragedy occurred today
in Spinaceto.

876
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,833
It appears that the parents of a small baby

877
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:49,433
killed her by drowning her in the bath.

878
01:35:49,567 --> 01:35:53,733
They then leapt
from the balcony of their room

879
01:35:54,533 --> 01:35:56,667
and perished.

880
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,667
The young couple had boxes

881
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,467
of anxiolytics and spasmolytics.

882
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:08,400
Other guests had heard the parents arguing

883
01:36:08,533 --> 01:36:11,133
and threatening to commit suicide.

884
01:36:11,267 --> 01:36:14,600
No one intervened because after the fight

885
01:36:14,733 --> 01:36:17,400
everything went quiet for an hour.

886
01:36:18,867 --> 01:36:22,567
More on this tragedy
in our next newscast.
