2
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,430
You better get a hurry along.

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,976
We ain't gonna make it.

4
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,400
Oh, we will. We have to.

5
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,989
Take a break. Come on.

6
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,616
My turn.

7
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,971
"We will. We have to."

8
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,434
That was my brother, Henry.

9
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,897
Absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would.

10
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,862
The weather would dry out in time
to resow the cotton.

11
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,535
We would get this hole dug
before the storm hit.

12
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,662
God damn it!

13
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,205
- Jesus Christ!
- What is it?

14
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,956
It's a slave's grave.

15
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,750
How do you know that?

16
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,420
Shot in the head.

17
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,630
Must've been a runaway.

18
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,427
Well, that settles it.

19
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,511
Settles what?

20
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,097
I ain't burying my father
in no slave's grave.

21
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,474
Nothing he would've hated more.

22
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,560
Help me up.

23
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,355
We ain't got a choice.

24
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,161
That's it, brother! Come on!

25
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,829
- Huh?
- That's it!

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,289
Get you out of there!

27
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,169
Come on!

28
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,090
Come on.

29
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,301
God damn it!

30
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,972
- Come on, Jamie. Hang on!
- No.

31
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,558
I'm gonna fetch a ladder!

32
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,394
Huh?

33
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:10,315
Henry!

34
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,455
Henry!

35
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,206
Henry!

36
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,251
Henry!

37
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,797
- Henry, where are you?
- Right here! I'm here!

38
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,218
That was my brother Henry.

39
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:42,472
Absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would.

40
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:46,726
And his little brother...

41
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,810
Jamie.

42
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,563
Would never betray him.

43
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:55,693
Come on. Come here. Come on.
What's the matter with you? Huh?

44
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,196
I thought you were...
gonna leave me down there!

45
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,325
Come on. Why would I do that?

46
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,702
Why would I do that?

47
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,119
When I think of the farm, I think of mud.

48
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,957
Encrusting knees and hair.

49
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,336
Marching in boot-shaped patches
across the floor.

50
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,632
I dreamed in brown.

51
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,227
All right. Come on, lift it up.

52
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,980
- Come on.
- You know, just get... Come on!

53
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,066
- Hang on. Just let it... Hang on.
- Hold on.

54
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,986
- Lift it, Jamie. Lift it.
- Just get a little more...

55
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,571
Just stop, okay? Let's set it down.

56
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,616
Why don't we just run the ropes
lengthwise? We stand at either end.

57
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,284
No, the coffin's too narrow.
If it falls again, it might break.

58
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,579
- Well, we can try.
- No!

59
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,501
- Hap!
- Henry.

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,293
- Hap!
- Henry, don't.

61
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,337
- It ain't my fault what happened.
- Whoa.

62
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,673
- I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
- Just let 'em go.

63
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,841
Hap!

64
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,010
Hap, can you hold on?

65
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,017
Can you lend us a hand, Hap?

66
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,187
Need to get that coffin in the ground.

67
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,819
Hap?

68
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,823
I was a 31-year-old virgin

69
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,536
when I met Henry McAllan
in the spring of 1939.

70
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,290
I lived with my parents
in the house I grew up in.

71
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,877
My world was small,

72
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,379
and he was my rescuer
from a life in the margins.

73
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,509
Oh, really? He tells me
that, uh, you are actually a college man.

74
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,635
Engineering.

75
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,055
- An engineering degree from Ole Miss.
- Yes.

76
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,641
Did you hear that, Laura?
An engineering degree from Ole Miss.

77
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,017
My, my, my.

78
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,812
You know, Laura is a college graduate.

79
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,023
She got her teaching certificate from
West Tennessee State. We're very proud.

80
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,068
Mm-hmm. My dear sister's
the smartest one in the family.

81
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,238
Made better grades than I ever did.
Never heard the end of it.

82
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,156
She is smart.

83
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:52,829
Laura, you should, uh,
play the piano for us after dinner.

84
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,955
Hmm?

85
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,209
You should hear her sing.
She sings like an angel.

86
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,670
Yeah, you should play something
for Mr. McAllan later.

87
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,005
- Mama. Mama.
- "Ave Maria." That's my favorite.

88
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,299
- You will love that. It's so beautiful.
- Mama.

89
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:06,634
What?

90
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,054
I'm quite sure that Teddy did not bring

91
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,432
his new boss, Mr. McAllan,
over to hear hymns.

92
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,643
Well, why don't we just ask him.

93
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,228
- Mr. McAllan?
- Mm-hmm?

94
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,022
Would you like to hear some music
after dinner?

95
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,196
I like hymns.

96
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,033
He likes hymns.

97
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:37,915
I was unused to male admiration
and knew only that I wanted more.

98
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,462
It was at least a reprieve
from the sincere pity

99
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,840
and insincere kindness
directed at old maids.

100
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,634
- Right.
- So...

101
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,096
He didn't feel the need
to fill the air with words like I did.

102
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,348
He had the self-confidence I lacked.

103
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,591
- That's it?
- Uh-huh.

104
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,560
Well...

105
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,312
I can't say
I was truly in love with him then...

106
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,693
but I was so grateful to him,
it dwarfed everything else.

107
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,365
My brother Jamie's coming up
from Oxford next weekend.

108
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,785
I'd like for him to meet you.

109
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,676
There he is, right there.

110
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,595
Brother! Brother!

111
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,315
- You look good, brother.
- Likewise.

112
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,943
The air up here in Memphis
agrees with you.

113
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,153
Or is it something else?

114
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,657
Miss Chappell,
this here is my brother, Jamie.

115
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,034
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

116
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,204
Oh, he thinks he's one of them characters
in his plays.

117
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,750
Yes, but which play is it, dear brother?
Hamlet? Faust? Prince Hal?

118
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,252
One of them fellas that could earn you
a decent wage someday.

119
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,074
What do you think, Miss Chappell?

120
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,259
I think you're more of a Puck.

121
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,179
- Who's Puck?
- "Lord, what fools these mortals be."

122
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,806
Puck's a kind of mischievous sprite.

123
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,725
He's a hobgoblin.

124
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,728
Forgive me, brother.
I'm only trying to impress her.

125
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,189
Oh, you'll find Miss Laura is not
the impressionable type.

126
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,985
- Shall we?
- We shall.

127
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,905
I went ahead and told Pappy
you were here today.

128
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,585
Uh-huh.
I wanna hear. I wanna hear.

129
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,671
Next thing I knew,
I was sucked under,

130
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,049
concussed and bleeding,
and I was as good as gone,

131
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,177
another victim of the Great Flood of '27.

132
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,889
- I can't believe you never told me this.
- There's more.

133
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,056
Then what happened?

134
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,768
Well, I saw a shimmering light,

135
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,651
- like a falling star.
- "Shimmering."

136
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,062
And a great big hand reached out of it

137
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,481
and I thought it was God himself
come to take me.

138
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,735
But it wasn't.
It was my dear big brother, Henry.

139
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,489
- You saved his life. You're a hero.
- Indeed, he is.

140
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,409
Well, what was I supposed to do, huh?
Let him drown?

141
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,662
Here's to the future,
whatever it may hold.

142
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,416
May you be blessed
with happiness, health, prosperity,

143
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,628
and if she'll have you,
a house full of children.

144
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,299
My love to you both.

145
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,559
Bubbly.

146
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,523
Would you mind terribly
if I had a dance with your girl?

147
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,406
Miss Chappell, care to take a spin?

148
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,742
I'd be delighted.

149
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:24,100
Jamie saw in a different way.

150
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:31,065
And when his eyes were on me,
I felt like I was no longer invisible.

151
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,234
Thanks a lot, guys.

152
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,698
- I'll be back.
- Absolutely.

153
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,586
You look especially pretty tonight.

154
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,381
Thank you.

155
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,550
Jamie has that effect on girls.

156
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,178
They sparkle for him.

157
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,933
He likes you. I can tell.

158
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,686
I'm sure he doesn't dislike anyone.

159
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:55,191
Well, at least not anyone in a skirt,
anyways.

160
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,825
Henry's marriage proposal
didn't play out like I pictured it would.

161
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,788
He wasn't kneeling and the question
came out as more of a statement.

162
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,584
Henry wasn't a romantic.

163
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,545
He was made of sturdier stuff.

164
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,432
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:29,851
I loved domestic life.

166
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,396
Yielding to Henry
and waiting for him to come home to me

167
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,440
was what I'd been put on Earth to do.

168
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,989
And when Amanda Leigh was born,
I became hers completely.

169
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,076
Then came the day that changed everything.

170
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,994
Forever.

171
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:56,543
December 7th, 1941,

172
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,756
a date which will live in infamy.

173
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,134
The United States of America...

174
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,721
was suddenly and deliberately attacked...

175
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:13,144
by naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan.

176
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,315
The United States was at peace
with that nation,

177
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,236
and at the solicitation of Japan...

178
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,365
Daddy borrowed Mr. Robert
and 'nem truck to take me.

179
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,243
That's what I remember most.

180
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,164
The first things and the last things...

181
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,333
they always stick the hardest.

182
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,836
Thank you.

183
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,552
We'll be praying for you.

184
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:48,762
All right.

185
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:51,797
Don't forget about us.

186
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,602
Oh, I won't.

187
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,523
I won't. Okay?

188
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,986
You take care.

189
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,196
I will.

190
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,368
Y'all pitch in good around here, yeah?
Help your mother, now.

191
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,039
- All right?
- We will.

192
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,626
Keep them no 'count boys off Lilly May.
Don't let her get old so fast.

193
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,510
- You just come back.
- I will.

194
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,722
You come all the way back. You hear?

195
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,728
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

196
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,123
Thank you.

197
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,638
I can't look back.

198
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,599
I didn't look back.

199
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,648
They say it's bad luck
to watch somebody leave.

200
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,571
I held his heartbeat in my hand.

201
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,408
I remember every beat.

202
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,787
He was warm and alive.

203
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,290
I know every place in him...

204
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,381
and it was all I could do
to not look back.

205
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,343
No, I don't have favorites.

206
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,138
I love them all equally.

207
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,140
Every mother does.

208
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,730
But during all those four years...

209
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,318
all that time he was gone...

210
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,363
I only prayed for him.

211
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,035
God will forgive me.

212
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,425
Come on, now.

213
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,762
Dig that hole in there.

214
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,041
Come on, Ruel. Let's go. Come on.

215
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,295
Keep going.
Supper's gonna be ready when we get in.

216
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,048
What good is a deed?

217
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:18,514
My grandfathers and great uncles,
grandmothers and great aunts,

218
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,349
father and mother,

219
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:25,479
broke, tilled, thawed,
planted, plucked, raised,

220
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,774
burned, broke again.

221
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,153
Worked this land all their life,

222
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,822
this land that never would be theirs.

223
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,786
They worked until they sweated.
They sweated until they bled.

224
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,289
They bled until they died.

225
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,751
Died with the dirt of this same 200 acres
under their fingernails.

226
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:55,050
Died clawing at the hard, brown back
that would never be theirs.

227
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,721
All their deeds undone.

228
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:06,395
Yet this man, this place, this law...

229
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,774
say you need a deed. Not deeds.

230
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,076
Calvin Augustus got his land here...

231
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,204
and then Bud Leo bought land here.

232
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,918
Now I figure
there's a couple acres right here.

233
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,338
If only fences can be put up with lead.

234
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,507
They get taken down with lead
all the time.

235
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,427
Won't be too much longer, Papa, will it?

236
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,595
Around this time next year,

237
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,555
I'm gonna have me
about 50 acres of cotton,

238
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,724
50 acres of oats, 50 acres of rice.

239
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,351
Fool, rice don't grow here.

240
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,935
Never call your brother a fool.

241
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,230
I'm gonna grow some anyway.

242
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,858
That's why I'm not gonna be no farmer.
I'm gonna be a stenographer.

243
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,110
- A Ste... what?
- It's kind of like a typist.

244
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,198
- They don't allow no colored typists.
- Your sister will be the first.

245
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,391
Honey, by the way...

246
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,519
I bought a farm in Mississippi.

247
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:34,107
And we'll be moving there
in three weeks' time.

248
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,657
It's 40 miles south of Greenville.

249
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,075
Big old...

250
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,871
porch, fig tree...

251
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,916
Girls are gonna love the four bedrooms.

252
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,502
But we love this house.

253
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,922
But now they get their own room each
and Pappy gets his own space.

254
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,089
Pappy?

255
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,135
Honey, now Mama's gone,
we gotta look after him.

256
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,557
We got 200 acres of fertile land.
Imagine that.

257
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,898
- You're mighty quiet.
- I'm mighty surprised.

258
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,069
You always knew
I wanted my own farm someday.

259
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,612
- No.
- I told ya.

260
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,948
Henry, I had no idea.

261
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,700
- I'm...
- I would have remembered that.

262
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,747
Well, I'm telling you now.

263
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,875
You're gonna love it.

264
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,962
You will. Wait and see.

265
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,924
Hmm?

266
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,439
Honey.

267
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:06,408

Huh?

274
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,791
- I like the porch a lot.
- Yeah.

275
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,376
Huh?

276
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,211
Yeah? Who's gonna get which room?

277
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,088
Come on, come on. Come on. You, too.

278
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,466
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wait up there, huh?

279
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,635
You're gonna get the best room
for yourself, huh?

280
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,554
Is that it, huh?

281
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:10,096
Huh?

282
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,599
What's 'round the back
over there?

283
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:16,812
There should be a key right under the mat.

284
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,189
- Go on. Get it. Get it.
- Who the hell are you?

285
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,943
We're the McAllans.

286
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,280
New tenants of this house. Who are you?

287
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:30,241
Orris Stokes.
I'm the new owner of this house.

288
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,745
Well, I rented this place off
of George Suddeth just three weeks ago.

289
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,747
Suddeth sold me this house last week.

290
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,667
He didn't say nothing about no renters.

291
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,505
Well, looks like I'm gonna have
to refresh his memory, huh?

292
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,924
- He left town three days ago.
- I gave him a $100 deposit.

293
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,844
- You get anything in writing?
- No, Pappy, I shook on the deal.

294
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,098
I gave him $100, cash,
right there in the front room.

295
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,267
Had dinner with him and his wife. I did.
I showed him...

296
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,980
- Y'all best be getting on.
- I showed him pictures of my little...

297
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,941
You got swindled, boy. Damn fool.

298
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,318
You damn fool.

299
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,823
Never thought a son of mine would be
so damn stupid.

300
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,875
Come on, we can stay on the farm.
There's a house there.

301
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,118
We're gonna stay on the farm.

302
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,879
We can make it work. Come on.

303
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,048
Out there with the niggers
and the farmhands?

304
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,760
There's no place in town big enough
for all of us, Pappy.

305
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,304
Believe me, I checked.
Huh? Come on, sugar.

306
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,401
Honey! This is it!
This is our land, honey!

307
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,428
One of my great uncles, Uncle Willie,

308
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,682
got a hold of a piece of land
down Reconstruction.

309
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,141
He had a deed.

310
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:22,395
Four white men on horses rode up one day,
aimed a pistol...

311
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,606
said he was dead.

312
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,192
My uncle's good deed,

313
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,612
torn into 40 pieces
and thrown to the wind.

314
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,952
And so I ask, what good is a deed?

315
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,797
That mule made me a share tenant,
not a sharecropper.

316
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,176
And had me dreaming
about having my own piece of land.

317
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,346
Maybe that's where the problem started.

318
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,139
You'll be coming to us for all your food.

319
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,933
We're gonna be getting
all your stenographer money.

320
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:03,436
Nuh-uh.
'Cause I'mma be in California or Chicago,

321
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,854
where all the good colored jobs at.

322
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,658
- War gonna be over by then.
- No, it won't.

323
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,780
- But Ronsel might be home early.
- I don't want him home early.

324
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,700
- Early means...
- He ain't coming back early.

325
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:21,079
Y'all finish up.
Get these dishes rinsed off before bed.

326
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,729
Howdy.

327
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,982
Evenin', mister.

328
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,942
McAllan. Henry... Henry McAllan.

329
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,571
- You're Hap Jackson.
- Yes, sir.

330
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,907
My family and I, we just arrived.

331
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,535
I'll need your help to unload.

332
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,453
- So you're the new owner?
- I am.

333
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,297
Thought y'all weren't comin'
until next week.

334
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,085
Need to get unloaded,
get a fire on before it gets dark.

335
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,171
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

336
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,381
Evenin'.

337
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,014
Then tell him to walk.

338
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:24,810
It's too far, and we don't have time.
It's getting late in the day.

339
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,686
I ain't movin' for no nigger.

340
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,355
He can't ride with Laura
and the girls alone so...

341
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,943
There's no room in the back of truck.
Pappy, please.

342
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,878
Mr. McAllan was from Memphis,
and my guess was

343
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,048
he ain't know the eating end of a mule
from the crappin' end.

344
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:02,638
Told me he intended to bring in
one of them infernal tractors.

345
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:04,850
Imagine that.

346
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,980
Using a machine to work his land
instead of the hands the Lord gave 'em.

347
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,482
Huh? Gonna do some fishin'.

348
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,567
You all right, Mrs. McAllan?

349
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,860
Fine. Thank you.

350
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:19,364
You better get him to fix them shutters
or we're gonna freeze to death.

351
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,167
We gotta get that truck unloaded
before that rain comes down.

352
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,703
Just leave it right here.

353
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,792
You relax yourself there, Pappy.
We'll take it.

354
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,294
Girls are done in. I need their blankets.

355
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,088
All right.

356
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,966
There has to be some in here somewhere.

357
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,260
All right, girls, come on.

358
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,971
- Just stack 'em in the corner.
- Yes, ma'am.

359
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,354
"A Tale of Two Cities.

360
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,231
Wuthering..."

361
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,314
You can read?

362
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,818
My son Ronsel taught me.

363
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,070
He gonna be fightin' under General Patton.

364
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,865
You mean diggin' ditches
and peelin' potatoes?

365
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,825
No, sir, he a tank commander.

366
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,578
Oh, there's no way the army's gonna
turn a tank worth thousands of dollars

367
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,872
over to a nigger.

368
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,541
Now my son Jamie,
now there's a fighting man.

369
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,919
He's flying bombers.

370
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,339
Uh, my son's a sergeant. 761st Battalion.

371
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,883
Calls 'em the Black Panthers.

372
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,467
Hey.

373
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,386
Boy.

374
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:26,056
You know what they call a nigger
with stripes?

375
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,559
A raccoon.

376
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,646
Honey, where you wanna put this piano?

377
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,565
Let me get the girls to bed first.

378
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,650
Ain't no room for that piano.
Where am I gonna sleep?

379
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:38,985
We'll have to put you in the lean-to.

380
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,528
I ain't sleepin' out there.

381
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,948
- It don't even have a floor.
- Henry, please.

382
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,866
- There's no room.
- Get rid of that piano,

383
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,411
we can put a bed right there.
Put a curtain around it.

384
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:49,704
It's true, we could.

385
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,622
I don't want a bedroom
in the living room.

386
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,874
She puttin' me out.

387
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,558
- We're not puttin' you out.
- Henry, may I speak to you in private?

388
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,087
- Honey! Not puttin' you out.
- Henry.

389
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,090
When you told me that you were bringin' me
to this godforsaken place,

390
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,091
I barely said a word.

391
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,551
When you informed me he was comin'
to live with us, I went along.

392
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,261
And when Orris Stokes told you

393
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,847
you'd been fleeced by that man you rented
the house from, I kept my mouth shut.

394
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,975
But I am tellin' you now,
we are not gettin' rid of that piano.

395
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,311
It's the one civilized thing
in this place.

396
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,231
So your father can either sleep
in the lean-to or in the bed with you,

397
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,114
because I'm not stayin' here
without my piano.

398
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,818
You know what? You're overtired.

399
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,152
No, I'm not.

400
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,656
God damn it!

401
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,192
My great-great-granddaddy

402
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,876
and his slaves built the farm
that I grew up on.

403
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,463
One time, my granddaddy told me to go out,

404
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:43,424
grab a handful of dirt from the yard
and bring it in.

405
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,512
He said, "What are you holdin', son?"
And I said, "Dirt."

406
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,014
"That's right. Now give it to me."

407
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,977
So I did, and he says,
"Now what's this I've got in my hand?"

408
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,396
"Dirt," I says.

409
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,774
"No, boy, this is land that I've gotten.
Do you know why?

410
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,988
Because I own it. Because it's mine.

411
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,156
And one day, it'll be yours."

412
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,869
Except that land never became mine.

413
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,246
No, Pappy sold it after the flood.

414
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,875
He told people
that the river wiped him out.

415
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,627
But that was just a lie.

416
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,714
He walked away from that land gladly.

417
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,483
The army made Jamie a bomber pilot.

418
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,361
It was my fault that he's up there.

419
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,115
I made him promise
if he ever had to be a soldier,

420
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,825
he would get up to the sky.

421
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,287
They say battle is cleaner up there.

422
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,490
It all looks clear.

423
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,045
Adam's on the left.

424
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,755
He sure is.

425
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:06,965
All right.

426
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,098
Missed my daughter's birthday.
She's not too happy about that.

427
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,642
We'll get back soon.
I'll get you back safe, Rog.

428
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,603
All right, I'll hold you to that.

429
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,731
You got your pinup girl. I got mine.

430
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,275
Yeah, but mine's from a magazine.

431
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,282
Dear family...

432
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,705
I'm writing you
from a village in Belgium called Tillet.

433
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,503
Belgium is a country just north of France,
and it's beautiful.

434
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,799
Daddy would like it around here.
There's lots of farms.

435
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,509
What's this?

436
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,136
- "Come out fighting"?
- Yeah, man.

437
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,013
Of course,
by the time you get this,

438
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,057
I'll probably be long gone from here.

439
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,269
We always seem to be on the move.

440
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,896
- Man all guns!
- On me!

441
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,689
Move out! Let's go!

442
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,858
Come on! Roll out! Roll out!

443
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,115
- These people ready to go?
- Let's move!

444
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,954
Did you shoot your horse?

445
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,199
- What kind of man shoots his horse, Carl?
- Someone...

446
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,584
- Can't even get his feeding on time.
- My horse ate my tobacco!

447
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,708
- It's my property!
- Carl, I've heard enough, okay?

448
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,921
I don't wanna hear no more!

449
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,590
Okay? If you can't do your job,
I can't keep you on!

450
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,051
- Henry, no.
- Now, you know that!

451
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,510
Henry. Henry, I got...

452
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,305
Please. I got Vera and the girls
and I got one on the way!

453
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,889
- I mean...
- Man, I got...

454
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,266
I got a wife. I got kids, Carl.

455
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,519
- I don't got anyplace else to go.
- I got a wife. I got kids, okay?

456
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,895
I'm runnin' a farm, not a charity.

457
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:44,939
- You got till the end of the week!
- Please!

458
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,899
The end of the week.

459
00:33:46,982 --> 00:33:48,443
Then I want you gone!

460
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,317
Violence is part and parcel
of country life.

461
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,613
You're forever being assailed
by dead things.

462
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:41,621
Dead mice, dead rabbits, dead possums.

463
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,789
You find them in the yard.

464
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,667
You smell them rottin' under the house.

465
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,796
And then there are the creatures
you kill for food.

466
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:56,511
Chickens, hogs, deer, frogs, squirrels.

467
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:03,393
Pluck, skin, disembowel, debone, fry.

468
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,647
Eat, start again, kill.

469
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,194
I learned how to stitch up
a bleeding wound...

470
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,738
load and fire a shotgun...

471
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,284
reach into the womb of a heavin' sow
to deliver a breeched piglet.

472
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,746
My hands did these things...

473
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,666
but I was never easy in my mind.

474
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,006
Howdy, Mrs. McAllan.

475
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,677
Hello, Miss...

476
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,305
Vera. You can call me Vera.

477
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,140
Hello, Vera.

478
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,142
This here's one of my daughters, Alma.

479
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,062
We need to talk to you.

480
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,127
You can't put us off.

481
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,004
Excuse me?

482
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,382
We ain't got nowhere to go
if you put us out.

483
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:19,344
Ain't nobody gonna hire us this late
in the season.

484
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,723
It's not up to me, Vera.
It's up to my husband.

485
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,100
I'm asking you to keep us on.

486
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,477
I'm tellin' you it's not my decision.

487
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,773
And if it was?

488
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,779
Alma.

489
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,135
Dear family...

490
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,680
The locals treat us real nice.

491
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,393
They ain't like the white folks back home.

492
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,896
I get homesick.

493
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:16,025
And they do all they can
to make us feel right at home.

494
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,279
I'm mighty grateful for that.

495
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,906
Ronsel.

496
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,879
Henry!

497
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,882
Henry!

498
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,594
- What?
- Henry, your wife wants you.

499
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,181
Isabelle's sick and the other one's
comin' down with it, too.

500
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,141
I'm comin'!

501
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,021
It's whooping cough. Go get the doctor.

502
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:56,482
And tell your father
to put water on to boil.

503
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,526
Henry, go!

504
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,068
Go!

505
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,134
"I wish you were all there to see it.

506
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,973
Her dress was so glitty... glittery.

507
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,061
Even the white GI's couldn't
take their eyes off her.

508
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,897
Tell Lilly May

509
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:43,446
even the great Lena Horne hasn't got
half the voice she does.

510
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:49,369
Make sure Ruel stays practicing
his fastball.

511
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:52,372
Tell Marlon

512
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:59,378
I tried to save him some snow,
but it melted.

513
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:04,967
So I'll be bringin' him
a glass of water instead."

514
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,594
All right.

515
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,554
"And..."

516
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,104
- Hap!
- Comin', sir!

517
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,817
Hap, I need your wife. I need Florence.

518
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,694
My girls are comin' down sick
with a whooping cough,

519
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,697
and I can't get to town on account
of the bridge been washed out.

520
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,741
I remember you said she was a midwife.

521
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,243
- My wife ain't no doctor, sir.
- I realize that, Hap,

522
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,162
but my wife needs some help
and I thought...

523
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,999
- When did they start the whooping?
- Isabelle started a couple of days ago

524
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:39,835
and Amanda Leigh started coughing
a few hours back.

525
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,919
They still catching.

526
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,964
She can get you some remedies to take,
but she can't go with you, sir.

527
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,800
I can pay you.

528
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,762
I won't be able to come home
for about three or four days.

529
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,056
- Who's gonna look after my own family?
- Please.

530
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,933
My wife is afraid.

531
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,238
I didn't have the luxury
of only lovin' my own children.

532
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,661
My own mother, I remember being blue.

533
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,414
Blue from the dark of the mornin'.

534
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,166
When the moon would still be up,

535
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:21,627
she kissin' me and my sisters
on the eyelids,

536
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,212
us pretendin' to be asleep.

537
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,215
She goin' off to work...

538
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,969
to wake and kiss some other woman's
children in the sunlight.

539
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,764
I swore that my own children would have
all of me.

540
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,147
Mind your step.

541
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,715
- This is Florence.
- Who's this?

542
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,687
She's a midwife.

543
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,231
- Do you see anybody giving birth here?
- The bridge is washed out.

544
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,899
- She might be able to help.
- The girls need a doctor...

545
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:44,859
Damn bridge is flooded.

546
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,502
- What do you want me to do?
- Take her.

547
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,785
I've seen this with my own children.

548
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,789
We gotta get liquid down 'em.

549
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,499
But first we gotta clear out
some of this phlegm.

550
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,042
And that's real good
you makin' that steam for 'em.

551
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,962
Mr. McAllan, would you kindly boil
some more water, sir.

552
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,797
I want Mama!

553
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,174
That'll draw the phlegm
right out of them.

554
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,052
I should've taken them to the doctor
as soon as they started coughing.

555
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,679
If anything happens...

556
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,476
Now I know
what my mother must've known.

557
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,520
Your girls are gonna be just fine.

558
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,812
Okay.

559
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,190
That if something had ever
happened to that other woman's children,

560
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:28,193
that would have been the end of us.

561
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,574
Now I know that she left us
not just out of duty...

562
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,076
- but out of love.
- I'm thirsty.

563
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,164
Do you hear me, gal? I want some damn...

564
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,708
- You put that knife up to me...
- Now I know...

565
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,086
- I will slap the piss out of you.
- That love is a kind of survival.

566
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,290
We're taking hits.
What's going on back there?

567
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:51,178
I have visual. I have visual.
Bring it around. Bring it around.

568
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,010
They took out the tail gunner!

569
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,346
Take it down!

570
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,270
I need some altitude.

571
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:06,273
Grab a left! Grab a left!
Pull it up!

572
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:07,900
Here we go, Captain!

573
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:16,575
Roger! Hey, hey! Roger!

574
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,493
We broke formation!

575
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,538
Roger, come on!

576
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,082
Front gunner, are you up there?

577
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,417
I'm still with you!
I got him! I got him!

578
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,548
- We got some coming on the left!
- I see 'em!

579
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,554
Cover me! Cover me!

580
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,228
Oh, no!

581
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,899
No!

582
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,466
Mama?

583
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,679
Mornin'.

584
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,599
Glad to see you feelin' better.

585
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,938
Well, we have
some good news for ya.

586
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,732
We'd like to offer you a job.

587
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,567
Workin' here for me.

588
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:33,986
I'll need help with the girls.

589
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,113
Cookin', cleanin', that sort of thing.

590
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,618
It means extra money
for you and your family.

591
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,165
We don't belong to them.

592
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:51,754
We pay rent, work our crops for us.
That's it.

593
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,048
They can't just pick us up,
set us down like we tools.

594
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,842
You're the one
always talkin' about saving,

595
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,970
how owning our own parcel the only way
to get out from under their foot.

596
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:03,015
- We right there.
- I don't want you workin' for them.

597
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,060
I won't be workin' for them.
I'd be workin' for us.

598
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,811
I already said yes.

599
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,694
"For the husband is the head of the wife,
even as Christ is the head of the church."

600
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,072
"An excellent wife, who can find?

601
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,990
She's more precious than jewels.

602
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:24,203
Her husband trust in her,
and he will have no lack of gain."

603
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,457
All those Sundays.

604
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,795
- You really are listenin', huh?
- Yes.

605
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,130
And now you must listen to me.

606
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:45,975
"In my father's house are many mansions.

607
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,229
I know that to be so.
If it wasn't so, I would've told you.

608
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,983
I go to prepare a place for you.

609
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:59,071
That where I am, ye may be also."

610
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:03,117
I know that brings me comfort.

611
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,912
It brings me comfort to know that...

612
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,289
one day, my getting up gonna be

613
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,416
just a little bit easier
than it was the day before.

614
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,754
One mornin'...

615
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,714
my children ain't gonna wake up
to this place.

616
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,593
They gonna open their eyes up
on a new sky.

617
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:27,641
One mornin', we're gonna break this boot
from 'round our neck

618
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,060
and shake these chains
from 'rounds our feets.

619
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,022
One mornin'.

620
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,233
And I ain't talkin' about the hereafter.
I'm talkin' about the right now.

621
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,316
Right now!

622
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,404
- One mornin'!
- One mornin'!

623
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,655
I said...

624
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,324
♪ One mornin' soon ♪

625
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,995
♪ Oh, one mornin' soon ♪

626
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,665

627
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,753

Fire!

639
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,208
Fire!

640
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,921
Nice shot, baby! Nice shot!

641
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:44,885
Out of the tank! Out of the tank!

642
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:52,434
Out, out, out!
Out of the tank! Out of the tank!

643
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,729
Dad! Dad!

644
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,734
I got you!

645
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,154
Move! Move! Move! Get down!

646
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,450
I need a medic! I need a medic!

647
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,580
Lingered along. Lingered along.

648
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,004
Laid in that bed knowing
my wife out doin' my work for me.

649
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,341
Florence's hands all blistered up.

650
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,513
And I seen her rubbin' her back
when she thought I wasn't lookin'.

651
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,413
The rain came that next day.

652
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,043
A big, hard rain that packed the fields
tight as wax.

653
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,885
Nothin' we could do.

654
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:56,558
Sat there, watchin' and frettin'
for two days till it finally cleared up.

655
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,382
Hap, you in there?

656
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,674
Yes, sir.

657
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:37,432
- How you feelin'?
- Gettin' better by the day, sir.

658
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,435
Well, you look like
you know what you're doing there.

659
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,646
Family tradition.

660
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,232
How much longer you reckon
you're gonna be laid up for?

661
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:49,486
Oh, well, Doc Turpin says six weeks.
It's already been four.

662
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,238
I bet I'll be out there by Monday.

663
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,199
- Monday, you reckon? Well...
- Yes, sir.

664
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,868
I'll come to it. I don't...

665
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,330
I don't think you're gonna get everythin'
in the ground on time.

666
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:03,292
You're cuttin' it close.

667
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,755
Florence and the boys are
out there workin' double time, sir.

668
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:11,883
And you know field needs to be rebroke
'cause of that rain.

669
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:15,345
Mmm, don't I know it? Yeah,
wish we could control the rain.

670
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,974
Y'all ought to be
well into plantin' by now,

671
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,101
and you haven't even
gotten your fields laid by.

672
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:26,356
Can't afford to wait any longer, Hap.
You're a farmer. You understand that.

673
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,358
Yes, sir.

674
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,570
Of course, if you had a mule...

675
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,115
you'd be done in no time.

676
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,453
- We lost that mule to lockjaw, sir.
- I know.

677
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,081
Florence and the boys out there...

678
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,004
You're gonna have to rent one
of my mules, Hap.

679
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,002
You'll go on half shares
till you pay it off.

680
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,134
Send one of your boys around after dinner
to fetch that mule.

681
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,011
Yes, sir.

682
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,839
Honey, by the way,
I forgot to tell ya.

683
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,924
Florence ain't gonna be able
to work with us for a while.

684
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:00,176
What do you mean
Florence isn't comin' back?

685
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,055
Well, not till the end of July, anyways.
Until we get the seed in the ground.

686
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:07,559
- Where's Hap?
- Hap broke his leg. I told ya.

687
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,768
- No.
- I did.

688
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,019
- You didn't, Henry.
- I did.

689
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,343
I need help with the girls.
Can't you lend them a mule...

690
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,108
No, I can't lend him a mule.

691
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,818
You don't just lend somebody a mule.

692
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,238
Why don't I just give 'em the whole farm
while I'm at it?

693
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,201
I mean, if they can't get the seed
in the ground in time,

694
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,288
they need to rent one of ours,
and they can pay us a half share for it.

695
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,624
It's tough on them, but it's good for us.

696
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,083
Hap hurt himself working for us.

697
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:35,670
No, Laura, Hap Jackson hurt himself
workin' for Hap Jackson.

698
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,089
- Farming's a business.
- I just think...

699
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:41,676
You just think. Well, I just sank
everything we have into this farm.

700
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Everything.

701
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,098
We need to make some money this year,
or our family's in trouble.

702
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,684
Now, do you understand that?

703
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,438
Do you?

704
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,232
Yes, Henry.

705
00:53:57,942 --> 00:54:00,362
All right, then. Hmm? Come on.

706
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:07,744
8-30-62.

707
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,918
The date the Confederate forces crushed
the Union army in the Battle of Richmond.

708
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,172
I don't think he knew
that I knew the combination.

709
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,473
- Hello. Mrs. Jackson?
- Yes?

710
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:32,852
I'm Dr. Pearlman.
I'm here to treat your husband.

711
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:37,148
Oh, thank you. Come in.

712
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,533
If you'd asked me before then,

713
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,994
I'd have told you
all white folks was the same.

714
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,178
Henry stayed mad at me...

715
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,473
and he showed it by ignoring me
in our bed.

716
00:55:13,142 --> 00:55:16,145
I hadn't always enjoyed
Henry's lovemaking,

717
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,147
but it made me feel like a true wife.

718
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,959
I never thought of refusin' him.

719
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,505
How could he refuse me?

720
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:51,765
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

721
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,809
General Eisenhower informs me...

722
00:55:55,309 --> 00:56:00,399
that the forces of Germany
have surrendered to the United Nations.

723
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,861
The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.

724
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:10,241
For this victory,
we join in offering our thanks

725
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:14,245
to the providence
which has guided and sustained us...

726
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,521
- Hitler is dead!
- War is over!

727
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,608
Hitler's dead!

728
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,966
This is over, yes?

729
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:20,979
War is over!

730
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,398
Boom!

731
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,901
We're in enemy territory.
We're in enemy territory.

732
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,488
You dead, cracker, you dead!

733
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,908
We're runnin' over 'em.
Watch your right, gunner.

734
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,132
Bang!

735
00:57:50,174 --> 00:57:51,174
You dead.

736
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,728
Saturday was my favorite day of the week.

737
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,525
It was the only day I felt truly clean.

738
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,860
- Am I sitting down?
- Yes. Sit down.

739
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:13,490
The rest of the time, we stank.

740
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,959
Mama, somebody's coming!

741
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:09,503
- Uncle Jamie!
- Uncle Jamie!

742
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,923
Now come give
your Uncle Jamie a hug.

743
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,675
Who's that?

744
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,677
Is that my little Amanda doll?

745
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,221
- And who is this? My little Bella.
- Jamie!

746
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,765
- Oh! Give your Uncle Jamie a hug!
- Jamie! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

747
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,685
- You have grown so big!
- Whoo-hoo! Jamie!

748
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,520
- Now, who's that?
- Oh!

749
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:27,814
Come on, girls.

750
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,818
You look good, brother.

751
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,653
You look like hell.

752
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:36,559
- Don't sugarcoat it now.
- "Don't sugarcoat it." Come on!

753
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,407
Huh?

754
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,951
You see him in his uniform?

755
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,828
Oh, my sweet sister-in-law.

756
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,039
- Welcome home, Jamie.
- Come here.

757
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,712
- All right.
- You gonna see what he's got? Huh?

758
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,592
How you enjoyin' it here
in Henry's version of paradise?

759
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,179
You'd think a son would see fit
to say hello to his own father.

760
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,600
Oh, dearest Pappy.
God, how much I missed you.

761
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,310
He's missed you, too,
though he won't admit it.

762
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:13,401
Yeah. Well, I bet he's quit chewing chaw
and joined the NAACP, too.

763
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,573
Come on,
I can't believe you walked out here!

764
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:20,742
Well...

765
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,662
I didn't wanna bother you guys.

766
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,038
It's, uh...

767
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,173
That's the last thing that she said.

768
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,218
Boy!

769
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,345
Oh, Lord!

770
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,889
Oh, boy.

771
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,100
So, what's it like being a big war hero?

772
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:49,562
- Shit, I wouldn't know.
- No, don't give me that.

773
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,898
Army wrote me letters
about your fancy medals.

774
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,443
Said it was the highest honor
an airman could achieve.

775
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,780
- They did?
- Well...

776
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,199
I was lucky.

777
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,828
- Other men weren't.
- Yeah. Well...

778
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,831
I bet you got plenty of tail
out if it, too.

779
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,750
Oh, Jamie never needed medals
to get girls, Pappy.

780
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:11,918
Mmm?

781
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,170
- Take after me that way.
- Hmm.

782
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,506
Your mama was the prettiest girl
in Greenville.

783
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,885
And I had 'em all sniffing up after me.

784
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,932
Yeah. I'll tell you one thing for sure.

785
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:32,188
You had to kill a whole lot of Krauts
to get them medals.

786
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:35,692
How many did you take out, you reckon?
Fifty? Fifty? A hundred?

787
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,402
- Oh, I don't know.
- Well, take a guess.

788
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,322
I don't know.

789
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,867
What... What's the matter?

790
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,660
Man ought to know
how many men he's killed.

791
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,582
Well...

792
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,920
I'll tell you one thing.

793
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,970
It was more than one.

794
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,855
Well, son...

795
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:20,069
at least I looked my one in the eye
before I shot him.

796
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:25,992
Not like dropping bombs
from a mile up in the air.

797
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,748
Pappy.

798
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,667
- Pappy, come on.
- To hell with him.

799
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,421
Why'd you have to go and do that?
Hmm?

800
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,590
He's just proud of you.

801
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,718
- That's all.
- Mmm.

802
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,973
- Yeah.
- Got a point, though.

803
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,558
We should hit the hay.

804
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,977
You'll be okay on the couch?

805
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,229
Yeah.

806
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,733
Come on.

807
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,366
Good to see you, little brother.

808
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,037
Appreciate you and Laura for having me.

809
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,164
Okay.

810
01:03:14,498 --> 01:03:15,749
You need a good night's sleep.

811
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,797
Feed you up. Get some meat on those bones.

812
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,298
Actually, it was more like four.

813
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,134
Four what?

814
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:30,639
Miles up in the air.
The altitude we dropped those bombs from.

815
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,643
The hell you even see anything
that high up?

816
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,145
You'd be surprised.

817
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,898
Roads, cities, factories.

818
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,860
Just not people.

819
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,156
20,000 feet, they ain't even ants.

820
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,246
Pappy's right.

821
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,958
Man ought to know.

822
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:03,882
Good night.

823
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,699
Home again, home again. Jiggity-jig.

824
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:39,959
Tupelo! Next stop, Tupelo!

825
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,510
Coon, spade, darky, nigger.

826
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,346
Went off to fight for my country

827
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,765
to come back
and find it hadn't changed a bit.

828
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,488
Thank you.

829
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,622
Howdy, Miss Tricklebank.

830
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,542
Ronsel... is that you?

831
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,377
Yes, ma'am, it is, last time I checked.

832
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,047
Oh, I declare, aren't you grown up!
How are ya?

833
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,424
I am mighty fine. How've you been?

834
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:31,219
Oh, I'm getting' along fine.
I'm getting along fine.

835
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,345
You seen your folks yet?

836
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:36,515
No, I just wanted to stop by and get 'em
a couple of things before I went home.

837
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:41,187
Hello, Ronsel. I'm Mrs. McAllan.
Your parents work on our farm.

838
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,271
How you do, ma'am?

839
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,482
Your mother talks about you
all the time.

840
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:46,525
I know they'll be mighty glad to see you.

841
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,236
Is that everything?

842
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:55,201
Oh, no. Uh, I just needed to get
some sugar and some candy.

843
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,702
Sugar and candy?

844
01:05:56,785 --> 01:06:00,706
Yes. The sugar's for my mama,
and the candy's for Marlon and Lilly May.

845
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:02,750
Figured I'd spoil 'em a little bit.

846
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,836
- Sergeant's pay.
- I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

847
01:06:05,919 --> 01:06:07,005
Yes, ma'am.

848
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,175
You have a great day. Mrs. McAllan.

849
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,765
Look what we got here. A jig in a uniform.

850
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,186
Where do you think you're goin', boy?

851
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,773
I beg your pardon, sir. I'm just tryin'
to get home to see my folks.

852
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:28,137
- Not that way you ain't.
- Pappy, this is Ronsel.

853
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,903
Hap and Florence's son.
Just returned from overseas.

854
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,405
Oh, oh!

855
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:36,242
Well, that explains why you're tryin'
to leave by the front door.

856
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,328
You must be confused
as to your whereabouts.

857
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,166
- No, sir, I'm not confused at all.
- Oh, I think you are, boy.

858
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,169
I don't know
what they let you do over there,

859
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,838
but you're in Mississippi now, nigger.

860
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,257
You use the back door.

861
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:58,222
Go on, son.
Son, we don't want no trouble here. Go on.

862
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,016
Go on.

863
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,061
You know what? You're absolutely right.

864
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:07,065
When we was overseas,
they didn't make us use the back door.

865
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,942
General Patton put us on the front line.

866
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,112
Yes, sir. You know what we did?

867
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:17,575
We kicked the hell out of Hitler
and them Jerries.

868
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,080
While y'all at home safe and sound.

869
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,587
Henry, I'm almost done here.

870
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,635
Home again, home again.

871
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,601
Bless us, O Lord, and these
thy gifts which we are about to receive

872
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,312
from thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord and savior.

873
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,440
And, Lord,
thank you for the sun you've been sending

874
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:52,568
to make the cotton grow,
and for the health of all here present.

875
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:57,573
And, Lord Jesus,
please watch over my boy Ronsel,

876
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,033
wherever in creation he may be.

877
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:02,453
Amen.

878
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,330
Ronsel!

879
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,377
Hey, hey, hey.

880
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,879
Oh, my baby!

881
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,135
Oh, look at you. You're so grown.

882
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,970
- Handsome, too.
- Lilly May! Hey.

883
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,141
Oh, Marlon, look at you.
You about my size. You shot up, huh?

884
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,810
- What'd you get them medals for?
- How was the trip home?

885
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,054
For killing Germans?

886
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,104
- Why you ain't tell us you was coming?
- Quit fussing over him now...

887
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,817
and let him come say hello to his father.

888
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,925
I knew you'd come. I prayed for it.

889
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,305
Thank you, God.
Look at you.

890
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:04,348
Look at you.

891
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,029
What in the devil happened to you?

892
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,867
Mom, I brought you some groceries.

893
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,203
Oh, thank you, baby.

894
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,123
Come on, sit down.

895
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,919
Providence.

896
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,838
- Want some rice?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

897
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,923
- Thank you, God.
- Amen.

898
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,730
I ain't never known you
to smoke, son.

899
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,651
Well, a lot's changed, Pop.

900
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,126
You sure you get enough to eat?

901
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,574
Yes.

902
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,079
I'm stuffed. I used to be dreamin'
about them biscuits, too.

903
01:10:09,162 --> 01:10:11,039
Yeah, I dreamt about you, too.

904
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,086
What'd you see?

905
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,383
You back with us now, safe and sound.

906
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,969
Be nice to have
another pair of hands.

907
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,765
With you home, we might can make up
what we lost after my accident.

908
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:31,477
Pay off the lien, get a new contract,
go back to being tenants next year.

909
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,105
Maybe he got plans of his own.
Let him follow his own mind, Hap.

910
01:10:35,188 --> 01:10:36,357
No, no, Mama.

911
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,403
Yes, of course, I'll stay.

912
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,530
Of course.

913
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:48,494
Give me time to figure things out
and put this war behind me.

914
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,212
What's he want now?

915
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,056
Evening, Mr. McAllan.

916
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,975
Evening, Hap. Florence.

917
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,938
This our son Ronsel I told you about.

918
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,398
Yeah, we already met.

919
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:21,944
- Hap, I'd better speak to you alone.
- Huh.

920
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,072
I'm not a child, sir.

921
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,867
Anything you can say to my daddy,
you can say in front of me.

922
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:35,249
All right, then. You're asking for
a whole heap of trouble...

923
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,669
acting the way you did
at Tricklebank's earlier.

924
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:42,172
Now, I know
you don't want that kinda trouble.

925
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:46,134
Not for yourself, or for your family.

926
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,845
Boy, what'd you do?

927
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,306
He couldn't have done anything.

928
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:54,017
- I just tried to walk out the door is all.
- The front door.

929
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,106
When my father and another man
corrected him, he gave a fine speech.

930
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:01,233
Put us all in our places, didn't you?

931
01:12:04,277 --> 01:12:05,529
Is that true?

932
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,869
Then I reckon you best apologize.

933
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:16,499
I'm sorry, sir.

934
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:28,801
All right.

935
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,473
My father's gonna want an apology, too.

936
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,892
Ronsel will pay him a visit
after church tomorrow, sir.

937
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,643
Won't you, son?

938
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:38,396
Yes, sir.

939
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,693
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, sir.

940
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,111
You have a good night.

941
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:56,246
No point in fightin'.
They just gonna win every time.

942
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:04,588
Just not used to walking away
from a fight, Daddy, that's all.

943
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:07,800
Not no more.

944
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,684
How long you been back?

945
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,477
Oh, just couple of weeks.

946
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,563
Mm-hmm. And how are you liking Marietta?

947
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,023
Oh, it's a lovely little town.
Just lovely.

948
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:27,069
Oh, I got that one right there.
Put that there.

949
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,822
Much obliged, Miss Tricklebank.
You have yourself a wonderful day.

950
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:30,906
- Take care.
- Yeah.

951
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,453
Look at that.

952
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,330
- What's that about?
- What's wrong with him?

953
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,752
He must've just come back from the war.

954
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:53,803
It's all right.

955
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,933
It's just a car. It must've backfired.
Stuck intake valve.

956
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,867
They say it stops eventually.

957
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,750
You're Ronsel. Hap's son.

958
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,253
Jamie McAllan. Henry's Brother.

959
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,464
Pleasure to meet you.

960
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,218
You walk here?

961
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,971
Yes.

962
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,681
Let me give you a lift.

963
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:41,059
Come on.

964
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,925
This is Bob Dunning
with the highlights

965
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,845
for the 15th Annual All-Star Game.

966
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:21,058
- Come on up front!
- I'm fine right where I am.

967
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,769
Get in, soldier. That's an order.

968
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,771
In the National League, heavy artillery.

969
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:29,149
John Mize, Walker Cooper,
Ralph Kiner and Stan Musial.

970
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:32,903
The American League pioneers,

971
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:36,031
Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio,
George Kell and Lou Boudreau.

972
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:43,080
- How'd you know you outrank me?
- I was a captain.

973
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:47,084
They got Negro captains.
I served under plenty of 'em.

974
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:53,465
Well, you obeyed my order.
I bet you was a sergeant.

975
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,468
761st Tank Battalion.

976
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,012
"Come Out Fighting."

977
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:03,475
We spearheaded for General Patton.

978
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,144
You?

979
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:09,147
I flew B-25s.

980
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,985
So, Sergeant, how do you like
being back here in the delta?

981
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:21,577
Yeah, me, too.

982
01:16:22,535 --> 01:16:25,205
- Heard you and my pappy had some words.
- I apologized for that.

983
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:28,333
He's a disagreeable son of a bitch.
I'm sure he had it coming.

984
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:34,047
- Here's to you.
- I'm fine, thank you.

985
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,174
Boy, you always this stubborn,

986
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,761
or just around white people
tryin' to be nice?

987
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:43,891
Go on.

988
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,817
Now, what kind of NCO are you?

989
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:03,243
Now, don't waste it, now.
That's my medicine.

990
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:04,703
I need every drop.

991
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,670
You tanker boys ever piss in your helmets?

992
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:18,300
- Plenty of times.
- We had a relief tube up in the cockpit.

993
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:22,137
Sometimes it was easier just to go
in our flak helmets.

994
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,306
But at 20,000 feet,

995
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:26,892
that piss freezes solid
in less than a minute.

996
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,771
It's that cold up there?

997
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:34,817
Shit. I'm talking 20, 30 below.

998
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,652
One time we were on this long haul,

999
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,321
I pissed in my helmet,
I forgot all about it.

1000
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:42,783
We were just over the target.
I put the helmet back on.

1001
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:45,118
We're doing this bombing run,
dodgin' enemy flak,

1002
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:49,206
and all of a sudden, I started feelin'
something runnin' down my face.

1003
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,333
Yeah, I thought I was hit.

1004
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,670
I smelled like a damn latrine.

1005
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,800
Yeah, you must've caught hell
back at that officer's club, too.

1006
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,094
Boy, my friends never let me hear
the end of it.

1007
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,180
The ones that made it back, anyway.

1008
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,518
Yeah, I lost some friends, too.

1009
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,564
Well, here's to them.

1010
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:29,662
"I wouldn't get home until..."

1011
01:18:42,425 --> 01:18:45,929
- Everythin' all right, Mr. Jamie?
- Oh, everything's just fine.

1012
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:48,766
Just gave Ronsel here a little lift
from town.

1013
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,979
I'll be heading back to town
next Saturday afternoon.

1014
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,606
If you like, I'll stop by here
and see if you want a ride.

1015
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,984
That'd be fine.

1016
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:01,193
Well, all right.

1017
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:03,196
Hap.

1018
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:17,627
♪ Don't you see how they done my Lord? ♪

1019
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:24,092

1020
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:31,641

Oh, Lord.

1025
01:20:00,628 --> 01:20:02,130
I got you somethin', Mom.

1026
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,591
Oh.

1027
01:20:06,509 --> 01:20:08,053
This is so much.

1028
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,264
I'll save it for your brother and sister.
They'll love it.

1029
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,348
No.

1030
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,560
- I got it for you.
- Oh, baby, I can't.

1031
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,521
I'm gonna watch you eat it.

1032
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:28,573
Hmm.

1033
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:32,953
Mm-hmm.

1034
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,457
Thank you, son.

1035
01:20:39,792 --> 01:20:42,838
Finish it, Mom. Don't save it.
Don't save it, Mom.

1036
01:20:44,672 --> 01:20:47,467
I better not see Lilly May or Marlon
with none of that.

1037
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:48,801
All right.

1038
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:53,640
I love you.

1039
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:55,225
I love you, too, sweetie.

1040
01:20:58,937 --> 01:20:59,980
Thank you.

1041
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:02,232
I can't...

1042
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:07,778
I tried.

1043
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,660
I'm sorry.

1044
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,415
I can't...

1045
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,501
I can't swim.

1046
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,005
Oh, God.

1047
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:28,926
Oh, God.

1048
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:31,929
Oh, my God.

1049
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:37,392
Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Jamie.
It's okay. It's okay.

1050
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:42,606
It's me. It's me. It's okay. It's okay.

1051
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:48,820
It's okay. Come here, come here.

1052
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,161
No.

1053
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,623
No, I can't.

1054
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:01,666
- Jamie.
- I gotta go.

1055
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,810
As usual,
when anything bad happened,

1056
01:22:20,893 --> 01:22:22,354
Henry was away.

1057
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:28,109
He and Pappy had gone to see about
some hogs, so I was alone with the girls.

1058
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,121
Vera?

1059
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,085
You need to take me to town.

1060
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,421
I'm gonna kill Carl.

1061
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,885
Vera, why don't you come
and sit down and we'll talk...

1062
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,179
I don't have time to sit down.

1063
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,806
He's with her now.

1064
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:01,935
Started in on Alma, just like with Renie.

1065
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,896
Amanda Leigh,
take your sister into the house.

1066
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:09,151
Amanda, go on. Go on 'round the back, go.

1067
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,532
- Vera?
- You gotta take me to town now.

1068
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:20,453
- I can't drive.
- I seen you drivin'...

1069
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,707
And I got in trouble for it.
My husband took the keys away.

1070
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,420
Come on.

1071
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:54,321
They found Carl's body
laying in the road halfway to town.

1072
01:23:56,448 --> 01:24:00,076
Florence said she'd seen her walking
down Main Street covered in blood.

1073
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:04,914
She said it looked like
she'd bathed in it.

1074
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,961
Vera had stabbed him 17 times.

1075
01:24:11,254 --> 01:24:14,006
But I didn't find out those details
till later.

1076
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,470
I was too lost in my own misery.

1077
01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:32,775
What's wrong, Mama?

1078
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,612
Amanda Leigh, I need you to be a big girl
and go and get Florence.

1079
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:39,324
You remember how to get there?
Good girl, run as fast as you can.

1080
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,122
No!

1081
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:48,125
No!

1082
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:32,043
I lost one of my babies once, too.

1083
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,258
His name was Samuel.

1084
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,211
I used to come here all the time
when I was a boy.

1085
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:20,675
Just when I needed to be alone
and clear my mind.

1086
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:23,344
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

1087
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:31,853
Here.

1088
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:37,692
Why are you being so nice to me?

1089
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:40,653
You look like you could use it.

1090
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:54,376
Bullshit.

1091
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:08,723
We were somewhere over Austria.

1092
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:12,977
We made contact
with a whole swarm of Messerschmitts.

1093
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,814
I mean, they was everywhere.

1094
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,944
Took out my tail gun, co-pilot...

1095
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:26,449
Made a deal with God right there.

1096
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:29,286
Swore if he saved me,
I was gonna do somethin' good.

1097
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:35,041
I don't know what that was, but...

1098
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,336
I promised anyway.

1099
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:46,511
Before you know,
whole bunch of P-51s show up...

1100
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,472
just like goddamn cavalry.

1101
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,476
They cleared those Germans
right out of the sky.

1102
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:59,148
And I swear, they were angels sent
by the Lord himself.

1103
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:06,197
Those P-51s, their tails was painted red.

1104
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,659
One of 'em buzzed me
right after the flight.

1105
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,954
I looked over.
I thought I was seeing things.

1106
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:15,707
That fighter pilot...

1107
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:19,502
he was colored.

1108
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,550
He saluted me...

1109
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:30,262
I saluted him back.

1110
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:39,606
Men that died that day...
they were husbands, fathers.

1111
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,066
They were good men.

1112
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,445
A lot better than me.

1113
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:13,765
Oh, well.

1114
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:58,976
We brought this for you, Mama.

1115
01:30:00,269 --> 01:30:03,648
This is for you, Mama.

1116
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:06,359
Now, you gotta...

1117
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:11,864
You can't have a shower
without the screen up.

1118
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,992
Now, where do we put that?

1119
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:18,455
What are you thinkin'?
Maybe here, in the water?

1120
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:23,417
Now you gotta help me figure out
where to put this.

1121
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,671
What do you think? In there?
You can smell it.

1122
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:30,091
Mommy,
Uncle Jamie's building you a shower.

1123
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:31,718
You little angel.

1124
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,053
You were supposed to tell me
if she was gonna be comin'.

1125
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:40,852
Thought you might want a little privacy...

1126
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:44,313
every now and then,
if you were havin' a bath.

1127
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,399
What you think?

1128
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:52,947
I think it's marvelous.

1129
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:55,281
Thank you.

1130
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:56,324
Well...

1131
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,081
I'll fetch some water.

1132
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:06,794
They smell good, baby.

1133
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:57,887
He hardly eats... hardly sleeps.

1134
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,559
Can't sit still... can't move.

1135
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:05,728
It's like he's just stewing.

1136
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:08,230
Waiting for somethin'.

1137
01:32:09,231 --> 01:32:11,901
Waiting for whatever didn't happen
to happen.

1138
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:17,448
Come on!
This bottle ain't gonna drink itself.

1139
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:19,742
Whoo-hoo!

1140
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:22,494
Already losing daylight!

1141
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:26,415
Hold your horses. How you doin'?

1142
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,087
I'd be happy to see me, too.

1143
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:04,036
Woman, you ain't tired?

1144
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,915
- We gotta let him go.
- We ain't holdin' him.

1145
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,459
He's staying for us. I know he is.

1146
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:12,544
Well, what if he wants to stay?

1147
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,133
It's not always gonna be like this.

1148
01:33:20,427 --> 01:33:21,971
Soon as I'm healed...

1149
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,057
we'll move out of here.

1150
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:27,393
We'll be okay.

1151
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,814
He'll be okay once he has his own place.

1152
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:33,107
We'll be okay?

1153
01:33:33,607 --> 01:33:35,818
I guarantee it.

1154
01:33:54,336 --> 01:33:55,672
Remember that?

1155
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:58,925
Yes, I do.

1156
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:04,013
You know what? You ain't supposed to be up
on that broke leg all the time, Jackson.

1157
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,683
If you don't let it heal,
you ain't never gonna walk.

1158
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:10,645
Why walk if I can't dance?

1159
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:13,480
Lovely woman, you are.

1160
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:37,004
Silver Star?

1161
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:39,256
- Yeah.
- Damn.

1162
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:42,176
Don't be impressed.
I got it for being stupid.

1163
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:44,428
What?

1164
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:48,349
You ever miss it sometimes?
Being over there.

1165
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:53,896
I don't mean being shot at,
but sometimes, I actually miss it.

1166
01:34:58,609 --> 01:34:59,777
Yeah, me, too.

1167
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:05,241
Over there, I was a liberator.

1168
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,454
People lined up in the streets
waiting for us.

1169
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:13,750
Throwing flowers and cheering.

1170
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,714
And here,
I'm just another nigger pushing a plow.

1171
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,718
Some of the men, too.

1172
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:30,683
- Yeah, I think about 'em every day.
- Seeing different parts of the world.

1173
01:35:31,558 --> 01:35:34,395
Italian girls, English girls...

1174
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:41,485
Some of those hairy Greek girls
with those big old hairy muffs...

1175
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:46,073
Yeah, it was somethin' else.
It was somethin', man.

1176
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:52,329
You ever been with a white girl?

1177
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:09,013
Shit, well... I'll be damned. Huh?

1178
01:36:09,763 --> 01:36:11,891
Oh, yeah? Tell me.

1179
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:19,065
Army gave us separate barracks,

1180
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:23,152
separate blood supply, separate latrines.

1181
01:36:28,782 --> 01:36:31,828
But them European girls
didn't have a problem with us at all.

1182
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:36,123
One day, we were up in Wimborne,

1183
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:39,043
old English girl walked past
and slapped me right on my butt.

1184
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,544
Never laid eyes on her.

1185
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:46,550
Said the white GI's told her
that we was more monkey than human.

1186
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:50,762
And she was checking for a tail.

1187
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:54,558
I'm sorry to laugh.

1188
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:59,646
So every opportunity we got,
we showed 'em just how human we were.

1189
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,861
- Yep.
- German girls, too, huh?

1190
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,239
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:11,575
Uh-oh.

1192
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,578
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1193
01:37:14,661 --> 01:37:16,497
I seen that look before.

1194
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:17,789
Huh?

1195
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:20,542
She must have been somethin' special.

1196
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:34,681
But that was then, this is now,
and I guess I'm right where I should be.

1197
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:38,936
Yep.
Right where I need to be.

1198
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,697
Throwing my life away.

1199
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:27,151
- I'll get you back safe, Rog.
- I'll hold you to that.

1200
01:38:27,734 --> 01:38:30,029
We got some coming on the left!

1201
01:38:30,112 --> 01:38:31,822
They took out the tail gunner!

1202
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:35,367
Roger, come on, talk to me!

1203
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:01,685
Oh, shit.

1204
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,539
We'll get it hauled out tomorrow, Henry.

1205
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,804
I'm sorry.

1206
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:53,820
Check? All right.

1207
01:39:59,743 --> 01:40:01,829
It's half past nine.
You just now gettin' up?

1208
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:08,794
So I guess you gonna lay around all day
while your brothers and sisters work?

1209
01:40:09,753 --> 01:40:10,754
Hmm?

1210
01:40:10,837 --> 01:40:12,464
What's wrong with you, son?

1211
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,884
What's wrong with you, boy?

1212
01:40:15,967 --> 01:40:18,887
Letter came for you.
Says it's all the way from Germany.

1213
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:20,806
Germany.

1214
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:24,518
Who's, uh, Resl? Ress...

1215
01:40:25,018 --> 01:40:27,063
Is that a man or a woman?

1216
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:30,899
How you... R-E-S-L. Ressil, Reecil...
How you pronounce that?

1217
01:40:30,982 --> 01:40:32,318
Somebody that I knew.

1218
01:40:34,236 --> 01:40:36,155
Where... Where you goin'?

1219
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:37,531
I'll be back!

1220
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:39,450
Ronsel!

1221
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:03,807
Oh, you think it's funny, do you?
Spilling good milk.

1222
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:07,561
Well, you know what they say.
"No use crying over it."

1223
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:11,273
Yeah, at least,
when it's somebody else's, that is.

1224
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:15,986
What do I... what do I owe you here,
like, a buck fifty? Maybe two?

1225
01:41:16,069 --> 01:41:17,946
Let's just make it even.

1226
01:41:18,029 --> 01:41:21,032
- I'm not talkin' about money!
- What do you want from me?

1227
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:22,784
What's the matter with you? Be a man!

1228
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:24,953
Oh, yeah? One pail of spilled milk
and I ain't a man?

1229
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,247
You sure as hell ain't actin' like it!

1230
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:30,417
You come and go as you please,
you disappear for days on end,

1231
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,378
and when you are here, you're drunk.

1232
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:34,380
I don't answer to you.

1233
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:37,048
When you're under my roof
and you work on my farm, you do.

1234
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:38,759
Oh, I'm sorry there, Mr. Boss Man.

1235
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:42,304
Ain't my fault your damn farmin' dreams
ain't working out.

1236
01:41:43,054 --> 01:41:45,932
Ain't my fault that
your damn cotton fields are flooded out!

1237
01:41:46,016 --> 01:41:49,270
You know your problem, Jamie?
You don't know your own worth, brother.

1238
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:51,939
You don't know what a man needs to know.
A man ought to know.

1239
01:41:53,815 --> 01:41:56,443
- You better open your eyes, big brother.
- Open my eyes to what?

1240
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,154
You're so busy walkin' around here

1241
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,571
- like God Almighty...
- Huh?

1242
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,072
Worryin' about yourself and your farm,

1243
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,741
you can't even see
your own wife is miserable!

1244
01:42:02,824 --> 01:42:04,184
Just watch your mouth.

1245
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,917
- Or what?
- Or what? Huh?

1246
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:24,680
- Yep. You know what, brother?
- Yeah?

1247
01:42:24,763 --> 01:42:27,641
Fine, Jamie, go.
Be whatever kind of man you want to be.

1248
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,643
Just do it someplace else.

1249
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:34,147
- That's fine. I'll go to town.
- I'm not talkin' about town.

1250
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:37,859
I'm going to Greenville tomorrow
for a few days to see about livestock.

1251
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:40,279
I'll expect you gone when I get back.

1252
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:06,388
What's wrong with you?

1253
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:22,196
You should have seen the look
on your face.

1254
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:23,947
It ain't funny.

1255
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:27,075
Au contraire, my friend. It is indeed.

1256
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:29,202
You about crazy as hell.

1257
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:31,997
Well, I can't argue with that.

1258
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:35,459
What you...
What you doin' walking in the rain?

1259
01:43:39,045 --> 01:43:40,797
It don't matter.

1260
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:46,966
What's the matter with you?

1261
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:53,477
What's the worst thing you ever did?

1262
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,272
Something bad.

1263
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:58,565
Real bad and you knew
it was gonna hurt someone...

1264
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:02,486
but you did it anyway.

1265
01:44:12,704 --> 01:44:14,498
Leavin' this woman right here.

1266
01:44:27,177 --> 01:44:28,345
Well, I'll be.

1267
01:44:29,763 --> 01:44:32,098
Congratulations, you're a father.

1268
01:44:35,226 --> 01:44:36,770
His name's Franz.

1269
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,773
Franz, that's a good name.

1270
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:42,651
What you gonna do now?

1271
01:44:46,237 --> 01:44:49,616
- She wants me to come back to Germany.
- That's a long haul.

1272
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,700
Yeah.

1273
01:44:52,285 --> 01:44:53,454
Long way.

1274
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:58,500
So, what about you?
What's the worst thing you ever done?

1275
01:45:01,252 --> 01:45:04,130
Who, me? I'm a saint.

1276
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:10,178

Yeah, I'm leaving town soon.

1288
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,686
I wanted to say good luck to you.

You've been a friend.

I want you to know that.

1291
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,377
Yeah.

1292
01:46:29,299 --> 01:46:30,967
You've been a friend, too.

1293
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:35,597
You might be one of the good ones.

1294
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:44,981
Take care.

1295
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,249
I hope you find your way to your boy.

1296
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,338
To your family.

1297
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:19,558
Take care of yourself, huh?

1298
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:22,853
You, too.

1299
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:35,406
Hey, Mama.

1300
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:38,076
- You hungry?
- No, I'm good.

1301
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,078
Where is everybody?

1302
01:47:40,161 --> 01:47:42,498
Gone up to church. Late service.

1303
01:47:48,044 --> 01:47:49,129
Hmm.

1304
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:50,589
Here.

1305
01:48:00,098 --> 01:48:05,729
- And there he is, drunk again.
- Uncle Jamie!

1306
01:48:05,812 --> 01:48:08,023
Hello there, dear family.

1307
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:10,984
Who the hell was that with you
in the truck?

1308
01:48:11,067 --> 01:48:13,862
The one I seen you drivin'. Who was it?

1309
01:48:15,113 --> 01:48:16,364
Ronsel Jackson. What's it to you?

1310
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:20,452
You wanna tell me why that nigger
was ridin' upside you in the truck

1311
01:48:20,535 --> 01:48:22,037
like two peas in a pod?

1312
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:25,916
He can ride wherever I say. Anything else?

1313
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:29,878
You. You son of a bitch.

1314
01:48:34,883 --> 01:48:38,136
- You ain't worth a damn, you know that?
- Yeah, I know that.

1315
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:41,056
Mr. Big, Big War Hero, is ya?

1316
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:44,517
You're nothin' but a damn drunk!
Give me them keys.

1317
01:48:45,351 --> 01:48:46,728
Just go.

1318
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,940
Oh, you want him all to yourself,
huh, gal?

1319
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:52,734
Too bad he's all liquored up.
He can't do you any good.

1320
01:48:52,818 --> 01:48:55,195
- I beg your pardon?
- I seen you sniffin' after him.

1321
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:59,533
- Pappy.
- Maybe Henry is too thick to notice,

1322
01:48:59,616 --> 01:49:00,616
but I ain't.

1323
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:47,413
- You seen the letter, Mama?
- The one from Germany?

1324
01:49:47,497 --> 01:49:49,833
Oh, God, okay. All right. Hold on.

1325
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:52,669
Don't fret. Just wait
till your father come back, okay?

1326
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:55,296
Ronsel? Ronsel!

1327
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,010
Hi, there.

1328
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:05,390
- You'll be here for supper tonight?
- Uh, no.

1329
01:50:08,184 --> 01:50:09,645
You goin' someplace?

1330
01:50:10,561 --> 01:50:13,106
Yeah. Might, uh, head out west.

1331
01:50:13,189 --> 01:50:15,817
Got a war buddy who lives in Los Angeles.

1332
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:19,570
Los Angeles?
Jamie, what are you talking about?

1333
01:50:20,196 --> 01:50:23,033
- He didn't tell you?
- Who didn't tell me what?

1334
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:24,742
Henry.

1335
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:27,162
Told me to leave.

1336
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,750
- Probably for the best.
- So just like that, you up and leave?

1337
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:34,670
Were you even plannin' on sayin' goodbye?

1338
01:50:36,587 --> 01:50:40,550
'Course. First bus don't leave till 2:00.

1339
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:43,386
What about the girls?
This will break their hearts.

1340
01:50:44,262 --> 01:50:45,931
Laura, I can't stay here.

1341
01:50:46,932 --> 01:50:47,932
I don't...

1342
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:53,855
You don't need to go, Jamie.

1343
01:51:54,582 --> 01:51:56,960
- Whoo! Come here!
- Get him!

1344
01:52:01,631 --> 01:52:03,711
- Come here, boy!
- Get him! Get him!

1345
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:06,469
Get him! Get him!

1346
01:52:11,641 --> 01:52:13,226
Hold him down, boys!

1347
01:52:17,313 --> 01:52:20,150
- Yeah, punch that nigger!
- Hit that nigger!

1348
01:52:24,362 --> 01:52:25,822
- Get him up.
- Come on.

1349
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:43,423
Put your shoes on. Come with us.

1350
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:08,198
- Good Lord. You turn him loose.
- Shut up!

1351
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,575
Like hell, I will!
You turn him loose, damn it!

1352
01:53:10,658 --> 01:53:12,338
- You best listen, son.
- I ain't your son!

1353
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:17,123
Now I suggest you use that thing,
or you better point elsewhere.

1354
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:18,791
Otherwise, you better kill us both.

1355
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:23,296
You betray your own blood
for the sake of a nigger?

1356
01:53:23,379 --> 01:53:24,380
You do it.

1357
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:25,381
Come on!

1358
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:28,343
- Go on. You do it.
- Bring forth the evidence.

1359
01:53:29,427 --> 01:53:31,471
- He's guilty!
- Kill him!

1360
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,975
Did you rut with this woman?

1361
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:39,062
What the hell do you fellas care
about some Kraut whore anyway?

1362
01:53:39,562 --> 01:53:42,858
All those Fräulein cunts
got a lot of our boys killed.

1363
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:44,067
I say if Ronsel here

1364
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:47,863
gave her a little half-breed bundle of joy
to remind her of it, I call it justice!

1365
01:53:47,946 --> 01:53:49,489
Shut up, nigger lover!

1366
01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:52,200
How the hell do you know
that Ronsel here's the father anyway?

1367
01:53:52,283 --> 01:53:54,827
Let's ask him.
Are you the father of this...

1368
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:57,539
I ain't gonna say "child..."
This abomination?

1369
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:04,212
Go on! Say it!

1370
01:54:09,634 --> 01:54:11,719
- Yes.
- He said it!

1371
01:54:11,802 --> 01:54:14,305
The penalty for abomination is death.

1372
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:18,351
Huh?

1373
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:22,688
Pappy?

1374
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:25,150
Huh?

1375
01:54:26,817 --> 01:54:28,945
No.

1376
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:31,864
He ain't gonna shoot.

1377
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:39,915
You don't have the balls
to kill a man up close, do you, son?

1378
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:43,168
Unh-unh.

1379
01:54:44,752 --> 01:54:47,088
You ain't gonna kill your own Pappy.

1380
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:20,205
You make one more wrong move,
these boys are liable to kill you.

1381
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:22,873
What we gonna do with him?

1382
01:55:22,957 --> 01:55:26,794
I already told you, he won't talk.
Ain't that right, son?

1383
01:55:27,628 --> 01:55:29,297
You set him loose.

1384
01:55:30,881 --> 01:55:34,094
You ain't exactly in a position
to be making demands.

1385
01:55:35,303 --> 01:55:37,472
Nigger still needs to be punished.

1386
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:42,185
You let my son there decide how.

1387
01:55:43,478 --> 01:55:44,938
All right, then.

1388
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:48,650
What'll it be?

1389
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:51,277
I'll give you a choice.

1390
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:56,532
You don't want him killed,
then you decide the punishment.

1391
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:58,117
No!

1392
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:03,081
His tongue, his eyes, or his balls?

1393
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,833
Choose.

1394
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:14,550
Choose, God damn it!

1395
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:28,106
His tongue.

01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:12,127
My boy!

1424
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:13,961
I remember every beat.

1425
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:17,673
He was warm and alive.

1426
01:58:20,843 --> 01:58:22,928
I know every place in him.

1427
01:59:31,372 --> 01:59:33,166
Pappy?

1428
01:59:34,917 --> 01:59:36,169
Pappy?

1429
01:59:41,341 --> 01:59:43,050
It's exactly what you think it is.

1430
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,930
They got Ronsel.

1431
01:59:50,183 --> 01:59:51,892
There were too many of them.

1432
01:59:53,143 --> 01:59:56,063
What? Jamie, what happened to him?

1433
01:59:56,146 --> 01:59:57,690
They were too many of 'em. I...

1434
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,361
- Jamie...
- I couldn't stop 'em.

1435
02:00:02,486 --> 02:00:04,822
What did they do to him? Is he alive?

1436
02:00:05,448 --> 02:00:08,243
- They made me choose.
- Choose what?

1437
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:12,622
Wake up.

1438
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:23,173
I wanted to make sure
I looked you in the eye.

1439
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:05,800
I appreciate it, sir. I'll, uh...

1440
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:08,761
I'll see you in a couple of days, huh?

1441
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:25,027
It's your father. He died last night.

1442
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:33,994
- How?
- In his sleep, peacefully.

1443
02:01:59,937 --> 02:02:01,356
- Hap!
- Henry.

1444
02:02:02,147 --> 02:02:03,649
- Hap!
- Henry, don't.

1445
02:02:03,733 --> 02:02:05,818
It ain't my fault what happened.

1446
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:08,237
- I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
- Just let 'em go.

1447
02:02:08,321 --> 02:02:09,405
Hap!

1448
02:02:09,947 --> 02:02:11,407
Hap, can you hold on?

1449
02:02:18,539 --> 02:02:20,875
Need to get the coffin in the ground.

1450
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:29,550
Hap?

1451
02:02:41,061 --> 02:02:42,062
Hap?

1452
02:02:49,153 --> 02:02:50,153
Appreciate it.

1453
02:02:55,868 --> 02:02:56,988
Why don't you use your boys?

1454
02:02:57,453 --> 02:02:59,830
My sons are not gettin' down
out of that wagon.

1455
02:03:02,041 --> 02:03:03,208
Okay.

1456
02:03:07,296 --> 02:03:08,213
There we go.

1457
02:03:08,297 --> 02:03:12,093
"Man who is born of a woman
is of few days and full of trouble.

1458
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:15,430
He cometh forth like a flower
and is cut down.

1459
02:03:15,513 --> 02:03:18,557
He fleeth as a shadow and continueth not.

1460
02:03:19,099 --> 02:03:21,811
And doth thou open thine eyes
upon such a one,

1461
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:24,313
and bringest me into judgment with thee?

1462
02:03:25,064 --> 02:03:29,276
Who can bring a clean thing
out of an unclean? Not one.

1463
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:31,111
For there is hope of a tree,

1464
02:03:31,195 --> 02:03:33,948
if it be cut down,
that it will sprout again.

1465
02:03:34,865 --> 02:03:37,159
But man dieth and wasteth away.

1466
02:03:37,743 --> 02:03:40,580
As the waters fell from the sea
and drieth up,

1467
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:43,374
so man lieth down and riseth not.

1468
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:48,546
'Til the heavens be no more,
they shall not awake,

1469
02:03:48,629 --> 02:03:50,840
nor be raised out of their sleep."

1470
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:55,761
Amen.

1471
02:03:57,262 --> 02:03:59,306
- Amen.
- Amen.

1472
02:04:07,690 --> 02:04:08,732
All right, then.

1473
02:04:09,609 --> 02:04:12,653
Come on, brother. Amen, Pappy.

1474
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,219
- Come on, girls.
- Florence?

1475
02:04:31,296 --> 02:04:32,840
Give this to Ronsel...

1476
02:04:37,553 --> 02:04:39,221
if you see him.

1477
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:05,915
Jamie!

1478
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:10,252
Jamie!

1479
02:05:16,509 --> 02:05:17,885
Jamie!

1480
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:28,896
My nightmare's always the same.

1481
02:05:31,148 --> 02:05:33,442
First, I'm in a tank wearing a helmet.

1482
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:38,072
Then I'm in the back of a car
with a burlap sack over my head.

1483
02:05:40,032 --> 02:05:44,411
I scream.
My lips move, and I can feel the strain.

1484
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:47,206
But there's nothing coming out.

1485
02:05:51,043 --> 02:05:53,045
I hope that my pappy's untimely death

1486
02:05:53,128 --> 02:05:56,006
brought the Jackson family
some measure of peace.

1487
02:05:57,049 --> 02:05:59,509
Though I must admit it brings me none.

1488
02:06:02,262 --> 02:06:04,431
All the while hoping that,
by some miracle,

1489
02:06:04,514 --> 02:06:06,976
- my friend Ronsel found happiness.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1490
02:06:11,897 --> 02:06:13,733
But should my story end there?

1491
02:06:15,484 --> 02:06:17,236
Silenced and defeated?

1492
02:06:18,737 --> 02:06:22,783
Oppression, fear, deformity.

1493
02:06:24,785 --> 02:06:27,788
It would take an extraordinary man
to beat all that.

1494
02:06:29,665 --> 02:06:32,459
I would have to wean myself off
laudanum and self-pity...

1495
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:37,006
and travel with a little card
in my shirt pocket that said "mute."

1496
02:06:41,885 --> 02:06:43,178
And then, finally...

1497
02:06:44,471 --> 02:06:47,266
I would have to cross the Atlantic
yet again.

1498
02:06:50,352 --> 02:06:51,895
This time not for war.

1499
02:06:55,816 --> 02:06:57,234
But for love.

1500
02:06:58,485 --> 02:07:00,112
Ronsel.

1501
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:04,784
Mama?

1502
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,355
And so I ended with that.

1503
02:07:39,151 --> 02:07:40,235
With love.
