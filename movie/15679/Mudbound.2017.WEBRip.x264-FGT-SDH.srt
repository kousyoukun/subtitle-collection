[HENRY] Huh?

318
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,791
- [ISABELLE] I like the porch a lot.
- [AMANDA] Yeah.

319
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,376
[HENRY] Huh?

00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,211
Yeah? Who's gonna get which room?

Come on, come on. Come on. You, too.

322

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wait up there, huh?

323
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,635
You're gonna get the best room
for yourself, huh?

324
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,554
Is that it, huh? [LAUGHS]

Huh?

00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,599
[SOFTLY] What's 'round the back
over there?

327
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:16,812
There should be a key right under the mat.

We're the McAllans.

New tenants of this house. Who are you?

331
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:30,241
Orris Stokes.
I'm the new owner of this house.

332
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,745
Well, I rented this place off
of George Suddeth just three weeks ago.

333
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,747
Suddeth sold me this house last week.

334
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,667
He didn't say nothing about no renters.

335
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,505
Well, looks like I'm gonna have
to refresh his memory, huh?

336
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,924
- He left town three days ago.
- I gave him a $100 deposit.

337
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,844
- You get anything in writing?
- No, Pappy, I shook on the deal.

338
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,098
I gave him $100, cash,
right there in the front room.

339
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,267
Had dinner with him and his wife. I did.
I showed him...

340
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,980
- Y'all best be getting on.
- I showed him pictures of my little...

341
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,941
You got swindled, boy. Damn fool.

342

You damn fool.

Never thought a son of mine would be
so damn stupid.

344
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,875
Come on, we can stay on the farm.
There's a house there.

345
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,118
We're gonna stay on the farm.

346
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,879
We can make it work. Come on.

347
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,048
[PAPPY] Out there with the niggers
and the farmhands?

348
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,760
There's no place in town big enough
for all of us, Pappy.

349
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,304

[HAP]
One of my great uncles, Uncle Willie,

355
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,682
got a hold of a piece of land
down Reconstruction.

356
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,141
He had a deed.

357
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:22,395
Four white men on horses rode up one day,
aimed a pistol...

358
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,606
said he was dead.

359
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,192
My uncle's good deed,

360
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,612
torn into 40 pieces
and thrown to the wind.

361
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,952
And so I ask, what good is a deed?

362
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,797
That mule made me a share tenant,
not a sharecropper.

363
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,176
And had me dreaming
about having my own piece of land.

364
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,346
Maybe that's where the problem started.

he ain't know the eating end of a mule
from the crappin' end.

932
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:03,882
[HENRY] Good night.

933
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,699
[RONSEL]
Home again, home again. Jiggity-jig.

934
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:39,959
Tupelo! Next stop, Tupelo!

935
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,510
[RONSEL] Coon, spade, darky, nigger.

936
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,346
Went off to fight for my country

937
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,765
to come back
and find it hadn't changed a bit.

938
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,488
Thank you.

939
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,622
Howdy, Miss Tricklebank.

940
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,542
Ronsel... is that you?

941
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,377
Yes, ma'am, it is, last time I checked.

942
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,047
Oh, I declare, aren't you grown up!
How are ya?

943
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,424
I am mighty fine. How've you been?

944
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:31,219
Oh, I'm getting' along fine.
I'm getting along fine.

945
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,345
You seen your folks yet?

946
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:36,515
No, I just wanted to stop by and get 'em
a couple of things before I went home.

947
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:41,187
Hello, Ronsel. I'm Mrs. McAllan.
Your parents work on our farm.

948
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,271
How you do, ma'am?

949
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,482
Your mother talks about you
all the time. [CHUCKLES]

950
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:46,525
I know they'll be mighty glad to see you.

951
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,236
Is that everything?

952
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:55,201
Oh, no. Uh, I just needed to get
some sugar and some candy.

953
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,702
Sugar and candy?

954
01:05:56,785 --> 01:06:00,706
Yes. The sugar's for my mama,
and the candy's for Marlon and Lilly May.

955
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:02,750
- Figured I'd spoil 'em a little bit.
- [CHUCKLES]

956
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,836
- Sergeant's pay.
- I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

957
01:06:05,919 --> 01:06:07,005
Yes, ma'am.

958
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,175
You have a great day. Mrs. McAllan.

959
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,765
Look what we got here. A jig in a uniform.

960
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,186
Where do you think you're goin', boy?

961
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,773
I beg your pardon, sir. I'm just tryin'
to get home to see my folks.

962
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:28,137
- Not that way you ain't.
- [LAURA] Pappy, this is Ronsel.

963
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,903
Hap and Florence's son.
Just returned from overseas.

964
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,405
Oh, oh!

965
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:36,242
Well, that explains why you're tryin'
to leave by the front door.

966
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,328
You must be confused
as to your whereabouts.

967
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,166
- No, sir, I'm not confused at all.
- Oh, I think you are, boy.

968
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,169
I don't know
what they let you do over there,

969
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,838
but you're in Mississippi now, nigger.

970
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,257
You use the back door.

971
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:58,222
Go on, son.
Son, we don't want no trouble here. Go on.

972
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,016
Go on.

973
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,061
You know what? You're absolutely right.

974
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:07,065
When we was overseas,
they didn't make us use the back door.

975
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,942
General Patton put us on the front line.

976
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:13,112
Yes, sir. You know what we did?

977
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:17,575
We kicked the hell out of Hitler
and them Jerries.

978
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,080
While y'all at home safe and sound.

979
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,587
[LAURA] Henry, I'm almost done here.

980
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,635
[RONSEL] Home again, home again.

981
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,601
[HAP] Bless us, O Lord, and these
thy gifts which we are about to receive

982
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,312
from thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord and savior.

983
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,440
And, Lord,
thank you for the sun you've been sending

984
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:52,568
to make the cotton grow,
and for the health of all here present.

985
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:57,573
And, Lord Jesus,
please watch over my boy Ronsel,

986
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,033
wherever in creation he may be.

987
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:02,453
[RONSEL] Amen.

01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,330
[LILLY GASPS] Ronsel!

989
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,377
[RONSEL CHUCKLES] Hey, hey, hey.

Oh, my baby! [LAUGHING]

Oh, look at you. You're so grown.

- Lilly May! Hey.

993
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,141
Oh, Marlon, look at you.
You about my size. You shot up, huh?

994
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,810
- What'd you get them medals for?
- How was the trip home?

995
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,054
[MARLON] For killing Germans?

996
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,104
- Why you ain't tell us you was coming?
- [HAP] Quit fussing over him now...

997
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,817
and let him come say hello to his father.

998

[BOTH CRYING]

999
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,925
I knew you'd come. I prayed for it.

1000
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,305
Thank you, God. [BREATHES DEEPLY]
Look at you.

1001
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:04,348
Look at you.

[GRUNTS]

1006
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,867

Oh, thank you, baby.

[FLORENCE] Come on, sit down.

1010
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,919
Providence. [LAUGHING]

1011
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,838
- Want some rice?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,923
- [HAP] Thank you, God.
- [MARLON] Amen.

1013
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,730
[HAP] I ain't never known you
to smoke, son.

1014
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,651
Well, a lot's changed, Pop.

1015
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,126
[FLORENCE] You sure you get enough to eat?

1016
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,574
[RONSEL] Yes.

1017
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,079
I'm stuffed. I used to be dreamin'
about them biscuits, too. [CHUCKLES]

1018
01:10:09,162 --> 01:10:11,039
Yeah, I dreamt about you, too.

1019
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,086
What'd you see?

1020
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,383
You back with us now, safe and sound.

1021
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,969
[HAP] Be nice to have
another pair of hands.

1022
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,765
With you home, we might can make up
what we lost after my accident.

1023
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:31,477
Pay off the lien, get a new contract,
go back to being tenants next year.

1024
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,105
Maybe he got plans of his own.
Let him follow his own mind, Hap.

1025
01:10:35,188 --> 01:10:36,357
No, no, Mama.

1026
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,403
Yes, of course, I'll stay.

1027
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,530
Of course.

1028
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:48,494
Give me time to figure things out
and put this war behind me.

[TRUCK DOOR SLAMS]

This our son Ronsel I told you about.

[HENRY] Yeah, we already met.

1036

- Hap, I'd better speak to you alone.
- Huh.

I'm not a child, sir.

Anything you can say to my daddy,
you can say in front of me.

1039
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:35,249
[HENRY] All right, then. You're asking for
a whole heap of trouble...

1040
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,669
acting the way you did
at Tricklebank's earlier.

1041
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:42,172
Now, I know
you don't want that kinda trouble.

1042
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:46,134
Not for yourself, or for your family.

Boy, what'd you do?

1044

He couldn't have done anything.

- I just tried to walk out the door is all.
- The front door.

1046

When my father and another man
corrected him, he gave a fine speech.

Put us all in our places, didn't you?

1048

Is that true?

1049
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,869
Then I reckon you best apologize.
