1
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,502
<i>In St. Petersburg,</i>
<i>Florida, this 52-year-old man</i>

2
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:10,473
<i>lets these two young women</i>
<i>into the house.</i>

3
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,142
<i>They lifted up their tops,</i>

4
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:14,610
<i>exposed themselves</i>
<i>to the guy...</i>

5
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,012
Chief Whitlock.

6
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:21,451
<i>Chief Whitlock, it's Ann.</i>
<i>Ann Merai Harrison.</i>

7
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:23,619
<i>Somebody just</i>
<i>broke into my house.</i>

8
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,555
All right.
Be right over, ma'am.

9
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,535
<i>...on the corner</i>
<i>of Church and Waterford.</i>

10
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,417
How you doing,
Miss Harrison?

11
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,718
Chief.

12
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,987
You okay?

13
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,355
I'm fine.

14
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,689
Mind if I come in?

15
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:00,991
Come in.
Thank you.

16
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,060
Oh, boy.

17
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:12,769
Did you, uh... you get a
good look at this fella?

18
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:14,704
Uh, yeah.

19
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:18,275
He was, um...
About your height.

20
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,542
Mm-hmm.

21
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:22,078
Your weight.

22
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,580
Come to think of it,
he kind of looked like you.

23
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:26,816
Looked like me?
So he was good-looking?

24
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:27,918
No.

25
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,319
Okay.

26
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,187
Sorry. Just not my type.

27
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:35,425
So this "ugly" man--

28
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:37,760
you know how he got
in the house?

29
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:40,730
Um...

30
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,065
The bedroom window.

31
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,613
It's all right
if I come in your bedroom?

32
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:59,115
Yeah. Come in.

33
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:01,151
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

34
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:04,421
Okay. I was asleep.

35
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:08,291
But, um, then I woke up
'cause I felt something.

36
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,460
I saw the window was open...

37
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:16,099
And he was standing
right where you are.

38
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:17,900
Right here?
Mm-hmm.

39
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:20,937
You sure? Okay...

40
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,672
All right,
so what did he do?

41
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:25,976
He, uh...
He came toward me.

42
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:28,445
He came toward you?
Uh-huh.

43
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:30,246
Like this?

44
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:31,481
Uh-huh.

45
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,551
Then he grabbed me.
Where?

46
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:36,987
Right here.

47
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:40,556
Like that?
Uh-huh.

48
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:44,327
But he was much stronger than you.

49
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,396
Like that?
Uh-huh.

50
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:49,199
He forced himself
on top of me.

51
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,300
Like that?

52
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:52,268
His breath smelled like

53
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,904
he'd been drinking on the
job, kind of like yours.

54
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,772
Really?
What happened next?

55
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,908
He kissed me.
Where?

56
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:01,911
Where, baby?

57
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,918
And he stripped me naked.

58
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,953
I was confused.
He ripped my shirt off.

59
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:22,098
You didn't put up
much of a fight, did you?

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,366
Oh, really?

61
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,604
I didn't put up
much of a fight?

62
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,206
So you took control?

63
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,910
What did you do next?
What did you do, baby?

64
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,311
Watch me.

65
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,314
Tell me what
you did next, baby.

66
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:44,487
Oh...

67
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:48,058
<i>Chief, you've got
to get down to the scuttlebutt.</i>

68
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,726
<i>We've got a situation here.</i>
<i>It's about to blow.</i>

69
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,995
<i>Chief?</i>

70
00:05:52,997 --> 00:05:56,199
Yeah, Tony, what's up?
<i>Where are you, chief?</i>

71
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,901
<i>Can you get here?
We need you to come quick.</i>

72
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:01,604
<i>Chief?</i>

73
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:04,006
Okay. Um...

74
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:07,510
Look, Tony, I'm...

75
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:09,912
Coming now.

76
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,814
No.
I've got to go, baby.

77
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:16,086
I've got to go.
I've got to go to work.

78
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:20,756
So we'll pick up
on this crime tomorrow?

79
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:21,958
Okay.

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,393
What kind of crime?

81
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:25,595
Assault with
a deadly weapon.

82
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:29,699
Breaking and entering.
See you later, baby.

83
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:07,763
How y'all doing?

84
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:08,898
Good, chief.
Matt.

85
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:13,503
Morning.
Hey, Matt.

86
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,586
Mathias Lee Whitlock.

87
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,854
How you doing, Chris?

88
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:35,124
You having breakfast
with all your friends here?

89
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,563
I would invite you, Chris,
but I don't want to.

90
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:45,868
I'd sit down,
but I don't want to.

91
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,737
Did they
find us a table?

92
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:51,407
Yeah, we're in the back.
Matt.

93
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,877
How you doing, Ann?
Okay. I'm starving.

94
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,313
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

95
00:08:57,315 --> 00:09:00,483
Hey, Chris, try the crab.
It's real good.

96
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:01,784
I'm allergic.

97
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,052
I know.

98
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:08,824
Right.

99
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:43,192
How you doing, Sharlene?
Hey, chief.

100
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:45,027
What time is it?
It's 3:00.

101
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:46,596
3:00. Let's go.

102
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:50,866
Hey, man, you're
out of paper towels again.

103
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:53,703
How you doing, Chae?
Good.

104
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:56,205
Thought the camera
only added ten pounds.

105
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:59,475
Looks good, doesn't it?
Kind of, in a pudgy way.

106
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:02,878
I thought this might
be an opportune time

107
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,381
to revisit my offer to invest
in that little business venture.

108
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,650
Costa Rica?
Yeah. Chartered fishing boat.

109
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:08,984
Steal the evidence money?

110
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:12,054
What's this?
You file a report on that yet?

111
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:13,556
Is that it?
That's it.

112
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:16,225
485 grand.
Can I touch it?

113
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,728
No, you can't.
I just want to touch it.

114
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,330
Get your hands out of there.

115
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:24,500
Maybe I'll just steal it.
Maybe I'll just shoot you.

116
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:28,137
Stop thinking like a cop.
Just listen to my proposition.

117
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:32,442
We'll take a grand out.
We'll go to the boat show.

118
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:35,177
We'll just walk around
with the money in our pocket,

119
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:37,179
get a sense
of what it feels like

120
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,449
to know we could buy a boat,
if we were of a mind to.

121
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:42,618
I'll see you in a minute.
What do you think?

122
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,924
Chae.
Stranger.

123
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:50,059
How you doing?

124
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:53,429
How you doing, Alex?
I need your keys.

125
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:55,898
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
How about you?

126
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,901
Listen, I need your keys.
I left a couple of things.

127
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:02,605
Okay. I'll go with you.
No. Uh-uh.

128
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:05,541
Why not?
I just want to go with you.

129
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,543
I don't want to get into anything.

130
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,945
I've got a lot of work to do.

131
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:13,015
I know your work is important.
Are you going to start with that?

132
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:16,753
I'm gonna go in the other room and
pretend to make a phone call.

133
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:20,456
Congrats on making detective.
Thanks, Chae.

134
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:23,459
Forget it.
Forget it.

135
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:25,695
Even if I left the
hope diamond in there,

136
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:27,229
it's just not worth it.

137
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:29,965
Bye, Matt.

138
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,434
Good-bye, Alex.

139
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:38,741
Would you just give me
the goddamn keys?

140
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,043
They're on the desk
right in front of you.

141
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,480
I'll drop them off.

142
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:45,548
Oh!

143
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:51,020
See you, Chae.
See you, sweetie.

144
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:57,776
She looks good.

145
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,346
Sometimes I think you
want me to shoot you, Chae.

146
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:02,948
Wait. Hold that thought.

147
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:06,885
Medical examiner.

148
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:11,023
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

149
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:13,859
What kind of prick dies
at cocktail hour on a Friday?

150
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:17,230
The nerve of some people.
Have a good one, Chae.

151
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:18,598
Yeah, see you.

152
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,231
Catch anything?

153
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,168
Hey!
Hey.

154
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,505
Trying to catch my self-respect.
Figuring out what it is I'm doing

155
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,240
in the middle of
this...threesome.

156
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:04,610
Try foursome.
You're forgetting your wife.

157
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:06,779
She left me.

158
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:09,515
I told her the other day--
I told her today--

159
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,717
come get her stuff.

160
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:14,287
So, how's the pro
football quarterback?

161
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:16,422
He's up north
hunting for the weekend.

162
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,394
The whole weekend.

163
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,771
I got a splinter
in my butt.

164
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,773
You okay?

165
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:11,277
I'm okay.
I'm definitely okay.

166
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,545
It's all right.

167
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:18,451
You still love her, don't you?
Huh?

168
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:20,553
You still love her,
don't you?

169
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:23,289
Yeah, I do.

170
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,126
Yeah, you do. Will you divorce her?
You still got your ring on.

171
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:29,762
Chris needs me.
Oh, okay.

172
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:32,231
He does.

173
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:36,034
He's lost, been that way
since he got cut from the team.

174
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:38,804
I feel sorry for him.

175
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:42,275
Remember that the next time
he goes upside your head.

176
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:53,686
Hello.

177
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,389
Mm-hmm.

178
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:02,961
Okay. Sure.

179
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,867
All right.
I'll be right there.

180
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:41,867
Ann Merai. Hi.
Dr. Frieland.

181
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:44,770
This is my brother Matt.
Nice to meet you.

182
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:46,672
I'm sorry to
bring you in today.

183
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,607
I was in surgery all day yesterday.
Please.

184
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:53,629
You can talk in front of him.
It's fine.

185
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:54,380
Okay.

186
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:04,824
Right. Okay.

187
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:09,061
Ann, I'm afraid there's been
a bit of a setback.

188
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,198
I had your tests back yesterday.

189
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,039
The cancer is not in remission.
It's come back very aggressively.

190
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,442
It's attacked
your liver and lungs.

191
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:37,390
How--how long?

192
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:40,626
Well, that's difficult to say.

193
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:42,661
How long?

194
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:45,431
Five, six months.

195
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,232
No one can say for sure.

196
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,644
But I feel--
I feel fine.

197
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:05,117
Listen...

198
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,653
There's a counselor here
at the hospital

199
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:09,488
I'd like you to see.

200
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,758
She's very good.
She'll help you during this period.

201
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,993
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.

202
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,429
Ann, wait.

203
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,233
Excuse me.

204
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:24,937
Maybe you could speak to
her about the counseling?

205
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,758
Listen, you should be able
to do something, right?

206
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,411
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like <i>60 Minutes?</i>

207
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,380
I don't know.

208
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:38,383
I mean, there are
alternative approaches.

209
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:39,552
Yeah?
Sure.

210
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:42,455
I mean, let's see...

211
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:46,325
Autologous cancer vaccines,
hematology procedures,

212
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:49,562
hyperthermia treatments.

213
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:51,597
Here. Take a look at those.

214
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,300
They're extremely expensive,
and there are no guarantees.

215
00:17:57,504 --> 00:17:59,304
Thanks.
Okay.

216
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,245
You all right?

217
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,365
Yeah.

218
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,084
Why didn't you tell me, baby?

219
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:13,652
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,153
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:18,757
When I was with you, I--

222
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,258
I forgot about it.

223
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,096
For a couple hours,
I didn't think about dying.

224
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,831
I understand.

225
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,043
You know, they've got
this alternative stuff.

226
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:40,412
There's a clinic in
Switzerland, and they say--

227
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:42,047
I know. With my blood.

228
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,217
I don't put much stock
in all that stuff.

229
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:48,186
They said there's
a 17% success rate.

230
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:50,756
A whole 17%?

231
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:52,725
Odds are better
I'd hit the lottery,

232
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:56,361
which is what I'd have to do
to afford something like that.

233
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:06,739
Now listen.

234
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,240
Where are you going?

235
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:10,643
I don't think we should
do this anymore.

236
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:11,911
Ann. Ann.

237
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:14,847
It wasn't right for me
to drag you into this.

238
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:22,187
You didn't drag me into anything.
I'm a big boy.

239
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:26,191
Matt, I'm dying.
I'm dying.

240
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,741
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

241
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:45,044
The girls at work
were so jealous.

242
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,880
Glad to hear that. I know
that's not why you called me.

243
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,048
What's up?
What's up?

244
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,784
I wanted to show you
something.

245
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,654
Chris didn't hit you
again, did he?

246
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:56,889
No.

247
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,692
When we were married,

248
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:02,695
we took out insurance policies
on each other,

249
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:05,197
but they were only
for $100,000.

250
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:08,567
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?

251
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:11,570
No. I remember
signing some things,

252
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:13,939
but I didn't know
he made any changes.

253
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:17,342
He can't get away with this.
This is fraud. You were sick.

254
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:20,713
No. I was diagnosed
six months ago.

255
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:23,082
Chris increased the policy
almost a year ago,

256
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:25,350
right after my 32nd birthday.

257
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:30,723
My mother was 33
when she died of cancer.

258
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:35,894
Oh, no.

259
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:41,533
That Chris?
He's here.

260
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:43,702
Maybe he can explain this.
No.

261
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:46,505
Why not? Now's the time.
This is not the time.

262
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:49,108
When is the time?
I don't know.

263
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,176
Please. I'm sorry, baby.

264
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:01,086
Hey.
Hey.

265
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,455
I'm just taking the trash out.

266
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:05,658
Thought you were working
a double tonight.

267
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:12,564
Yeah, I bet you did.

268
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,942
How was your appointment
on Saturday?

269
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:27,746
Appointment?
Yeah, with Dr. Frieland.

270
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:30,515
I didn't have an appointment.

271
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:34,019
No? You sure?
I'm sure.

272
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:36,989
'Cause Jay saw you
go inside his office.

273
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,091
You were going inside
with some other guy.

274
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:41,760
No, I just stopped by.
I had to ask some questions.

275
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:43,095
Now you were there.

276
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:46,098
I was there, but I had
to ask him some questions.

277
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,933
Here we go
with the lies again.

278
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:50,002
I'm not lying to you.
Yes, you are!

279
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,437
Start telling me the truth!

280
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:56,441
You're hurting me!
Why do you make me do this?

281
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:58,443
I'm not making you
do anything!

282
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:02,414
It ain't my goddamn fault!
It ain't my fault!

283
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:11,690
Chris, how you doing,
football player?

284
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:13,491
Good, Mathias.
How you doing?

285
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,393
I'm good.
Judy Anderson called,

286
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:17,796
said she saw a prowler
in the neighborhood.

287
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:19,064
You see anything?

288
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,599
Nah.

289
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:21,934
No?
Mm-mmm.

290
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,836
What about your wife?
She home?

291
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:25,670
She didn't see anything.

292
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:27,906
You didn't ask her, Chris.

293
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:29,574
She didn't say anything
about it.

294
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:32,510
Maybe I should ask her, not that
I don't trust your mind-reading.

295
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:35,748
Hey, Ann, how you doing?
I didn't see anything.

296
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,382
Okay?
Okay.

297
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:39,118
I'm gonna just
check the perimeter.

298
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,418
Go ahead.

299
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,520
You see somebody, you holler, okay?
Oh, yeah.

300
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:44,456
Ann?
Mm-hmm.

301
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,760
You have a good night.

302
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,899
We did it.
This wasn't necessary.

303
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:58,536
My name shouldn't be on your house.
I'll buy my own in a few years.

304
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:02,808
All right.

305
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:08,346
Chief Whitlock.

306
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:11,616
<i>Hey, baby, it's me.</i>
<i>What time you get off?</i>

307
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:14,153
<i>I've found a way to go to
that clinic in Switzerland.</i>

308
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,288
Right.
<i>Can you talk?</i>

309
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,990
Hold on.
Forget it.

310
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:19,858
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

311
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,595
You know, I got to go.
Tell her I say hi. Bye.

312
00:23:31,504 --> 00:23:32,737
Hello.

313
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:34,572
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>
<i>Can you talk?</i>

314
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:36,074
Yeah. It's no problem.

315
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:38,977
<i>You got to hear this.</i>
<i>It's incredible.</i>

316
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:43,081
I name you the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.

317
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,917
No, no.
Not me personally.

318
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,453
You name the living gift
as your beneficiary

319
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,639
after we purchase
the policy from you.

320
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:53,491
And you--
I mean, the living gift--

321
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,360
collects on the policy
when I die.

322
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:58,213
As the beneficiary, yes,
we collect on the policy.

323
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:00,532
So you make
a profit if she dies?

324
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:03,368
Is that legal?
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

325
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,003
How much do I get?

326
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:06,538
I know the amount depends on

327
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,007
how long your medical staff
says I have to live.

328
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,076
How about a ballpark figure?

329
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:14,713
$750,000.
I know.

330
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:17,449
Even if they have to repeat
the treatment several times,

331
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:20,618
there would still be enough money
left over for us to go somewhere.

332
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,222
Like the conch festival
in key west?

333
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:25,790
No.

334
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:28,126
Clambake in Opa Locka?

335
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:31,563
No! Europe.
Europe?

336
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:34,032
Yeah. Or Africa.

337
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,181
I'm going to beat this.

338
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,552
You watch.

339
00:24:55,655 --> 00:24:57,356
Richard petty,
give me a hand.

340
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:12,938
Hey, man, watch it.
Don't slip. Watch that blood.

341
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,252
Come on, Ann, talk to me.

342
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:30,389
Their investors won't let them
buy any new policies.

343
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:31,556
The living gift?

344
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:32,657
Mm-hmm.

345
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,460
We can go somewhere else.

346
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:37,296
We'll get somebody else
to buy it.

347
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,864
I can't. There's only
two days left to change it.

348
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,233
What do you mean?

349
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:44,069
A provision says the beneficiary
can't be changed after a year,

350
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:45,370
and that's in two days.

351
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:47,339
Well, maybe we
could call down...

352
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,773
It's too late!

353
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,515
Ann, listen...

354
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,784
Don't, don't. Don't.

355
00:26:01,587 --> 00:26:03,121
This is not fixable.

356
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,301
Just go, Matt.

357
00:26:16,303 --> 00:26:18,236
Just go.

358
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:36,855
What the hell did Alex pick up
from your place the other day?

359
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,490
I don't know.

360
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:43,928
Well, over for sure now, huh?

361
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,099
She left something so she'd
have a chance to come see you,

362
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,534
see if she still had feelings.

363
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:54,373
Based on what I saw, she didn't
have any feelings... except anger.

364
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,175
Think you've had enough.

365
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:59,011
I'm trying to help you here.

366
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,380
One of your patrons
has been overserved.

367
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:03,248
I may have to cite you
on that, Helena.

368
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,519
See you tomorrow, Chae.
See you tomorrow.

369
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:13,025
Man. Bustin' my chops,
Mr. Drinking-on-duty.

370
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:20,916
I'll see you later.

371
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:22,734
Good night.
Take it easy.

372
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:27,139
Let me get you
a refill, chief.

373
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,807
No, I'm good, Chris.

374
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:31,843
It ain't a bribe,
just a beer.

375
00:27:31,845 --> 00:27:34,312
Two, whatever
he was just drinking.

376
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,453
Thank you.

377
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:47,125
Let me ask you something.

378
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:50,162
That night you were out there
looking for that prowler,

379
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:53,798
did you see anybody?
No, I didn't.

380
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,702
'Cause I had this feeling
when I got home that...

381
00:27:57,704 --> 00:28:01,339
Ann was with
some other guy.

382
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:02,740
Really?

383
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:05,877
I think he snuck out the back
when I got home.

384
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:12,517
No, I didn't--
I didn't see anybody.

385
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:22,260
I'll tell you what,
though.

386
00:28:22,262 --> 00:28:25,197
Next time that little
pussy comes around...

387
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,798
Little pussy?

388
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,933
Sure. The guy scurries
out the back door

389
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:30,635
the second
he hears my voice.

390
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:31,636
"Scurries?"

391
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:32,770
Yeah.

392
00:28:34,108 --> 00:28:38,710
You know, I could
almost respect a man

393
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:40,712
who had the balls
to confront me,

394
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:44,082
tell me, "yeah,
I'm banging your wife."

395
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:48,220
Maybe this--this--
this guy,

396
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:50,489
maybe there's nothing
he would rather do

397
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:52,557
than, you know,
to tell you

398
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,827
that you're a lousy husband
and you don't deserve Ann.

399
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:58,062
Maybe there's nothing
he would rather do

400
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:01,065
than to walk up into your face,
look you in the eye,

401
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:06,138
and say to you, "Chris,
I'm banging your wife...

402
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,373
Good."

403
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,875
Maybe. You know, maybe...

404
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:13,044
Maybe your wife won't let him.

405
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:18,750
I'd respect him at least.

406
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:21,753
And if he did that,
then I'd go up to him,

407
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,588
look him in his eye,
and I'd say,

408
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,425
"just come near her again...

409
00:29:27,427 --> 00:29:29,594
And I'll kill you."

410
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:32,264
Oh, Chris. Wow.

411
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:36,868
You're talking to the wrong guy,
because, as a police officer,

412
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,704
I can't let you go around
threatening people's lives.

413
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,072
If you're serious,

414
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:43,441
then I'd be obligated
to do something about it.

415
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:44,442
Really?

416
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:46,911
That's right.

417
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:50,415
Thanks for the beer...
And the conversation.

418
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:52,083
Thanks for listening.

419
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:56,154
You give Ann my best...
If you can.

420
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:24,549
You been waiting long?

421
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:25,783
Hi.

422
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:28,486
Sorry about last night.

423
00:30:28,488 --> 00:30:29,854
Okay.

424
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:34,693
You must really
be mad at me.

425
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,339
God, I used to love
coming out here with you.

426
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,840
I thought I was the shit,

427
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:50,908
being a freshman
making out with a senior.

428
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,944
You were.

429
00:30:52,946 --> 00:30:54,512
Still are.

430
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:56,248
I guess I was, huh?

431
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,523
Here.

432
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:06,791
What's this?

433
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:08,760
My going-away present.

434
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:09,761
Going away?

435
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:11,028
Insurance policy.

436
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,934
Making me
the beneficiary?

437
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,803
Come on, Ann.
Yes, you can.

438
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:19,837
Buy that fishing boat

439
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,973
you and Chae
have always talked about.

440
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:23,308
Right.

441
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,809
Here.

442
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,778
No. I'm leaving tomorrow.

443
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,779
What?

444
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:29,180
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

445
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:30,715
And, um...

446
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:33,351
I've got to
get out of here.

447
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:35,219
I need to get away
from Chris.

448
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:36,621
I need some peace.

449
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:05,082
Chief Whitlock.

450
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,384
How can I help you?

451
00:32:06,386 --> 00:32:07,919
You just did, buddy.

452
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:53,698
How you doing?

453
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,733
Good.

454
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:58,069
Take this.
Meet me at my house.

455
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:00,104
What is it?

456
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:02,106
It's a gift to you.

457
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:04,743
Switzerland.
What?

458
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:05,910
It's money.

459
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:07,078
What money?

460
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:11,048
That drug money?

461
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,218
Matt, no, no.

462
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,788
Oh, my God.

463
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,556
What if they want it back?

464
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:20,592
By law, the money
has to stay in the custody

465
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:23,762
of the arresting department until
the appeals process is over.

466
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:26,097
With the money Scarcetti has,
it could take years.

467
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,565
But Tony and the guys--

468
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,067
they think I'm putting it
in a safe deposit box.

469
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:32,737
What time does
Chris get home?

470
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:34,639
Uh...11:30.

471
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,574
Go to your house, pack a bag,

472
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:39,611
meet me at my house, 11:00.

473
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:42,179
You okay?
Uh-huh.

474
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:44,048
See you later.

475
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,234
Ann?

476
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:10,141
Oh, hey...

477
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:12,076
What are you doing here?

478
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:13,978
Barbara's pissed off
about something.

479
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
Got to wait her out.

480
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,284
Listen, listen.

481
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:22,620
You see anybody
come in here?

482
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:23,922
No.
You sure?

483
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:28,326
Okay. Why don't you
head over to the Scuttlebutt?

484
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,227
They cut me off,
no thanks to you.

485
00:34:30,229 --> 00:34:32,564
Just tell them chief Whitlock
said everything's okay.

486
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:34,466
That's the first place
Barbara's going to look!

487
00:34:34,468 --> 00:34:36,568
She won't look there.
Yes, she will!

488
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,703
I've got half a pack
of cigarettes in there!

489
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:37,789
Lieutenant, tell engine two
to lay it out

490
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,924
and start attacking it
from the back!

491
00:36:39,926 --> 00:36:40,992
Go, go!

492
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,698
Pull it up!
Let's get moving!

493
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,568
<i>1919 on 415 San Juan.</i>

494
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,605
<i>That's about four Miles</i>
<i>outside of town.</i>

495
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,743
Go! Go! Let's keep moving!
Aim the hose right there!

496
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:09,420
Yeah, I got that covered.

497
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:13,257
<i>318,</i>
<i>proceed to Sector Seven.</i>

498
00:37:15,628 --> 00:37:19,897
<i>825, say again.</i>
Mathias, you all right?

499
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,967
I know it's hard to take.

500
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:26,203
I'll grab you
a cup of coffee.

501
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:38,549
Was it an accident?

502
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,384
I don't know. Maybe.

503
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:44,522
These propane tanks
just don't blow for no reason.

504
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:48,893
Man, this place
was an inferno.

505
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:51,462
Those poor folks
didn't have a chance.

506
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:08,112
Hi, chief.

507
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:14,218
Chief.

508
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:19,173
What are you doing here?

509
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:22,927
I'm a homicide detective,
and there's two dead bodies.

510
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:26,263
So what happened?
They think the propane tank blew.

511
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:29,901
You know who they are?
I think it's definitely "were."

512
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:31,035
Right, Chae.

513
00:38:31,037 --> 00:38:34,371
Hey, Mathias, check it out.

514
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:35,973
Definitely arson.

515
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:41,979
It's definitely arson.
Definitely.

516
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:45,449
I'm thinking the closer I stay
to the scene, the better.

517
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:47,551
Yeah, it's possibly
a double homicide.

518
00:38:47,553 --> 00:38:50,254
We're gonna have to
take this thing over.

519
00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:53,758
Chief?
Yeah.

520
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,394
Chief, Judy Anderson's mom
is visiting from Orlando.

521
00:38:57,396 --> 00:39:00,798
Last night, Judy said her mom
saw somebody sneaking around.

522
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
I checked it out,
I didn't see anything.

523
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:04,736
We should probably tell Alex.

524
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:06,971
I'll tell her.
You get back to the office.

525
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:09,073
Hey, chief, they want me
to run my investigation

526
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:11,075
out of your place
for the next 24.

527
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:12,744
I'm going to
need your help--

528
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:14,746
background on the vics,
people they knew.

529
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:16,948
A tour guide?
Pretty much. You cool with that?

530
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,282
Okay. No problem.
Are you sure?

531
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:19,984
No problem at all.

532
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:23,221
Why don't we ride back and you
fill me in on the Harrisons?

533
00:39:23,223 --> 00:39:25,056
My boys will set up
at your place.

534
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:26,257
Okay.
Great.

535
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:40,371
I just wanted to say I'm
really sorry about the timing.

536
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:41,873
What do you mean?

537
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:44,942
With the papers,
and then this today.

538
00:39:44,944 --> 00:39:46,277
The divorce papers?

539
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:47,912
I should have
called you before.

540
00:39:47,914 --> 00:39:50,047
That would have been nice.

541
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,183
I know.

542
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:54,185
But it has been eight months.

543
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:56,520
Don't you think
we need some closure?

544
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,856
I really don't want
to talk about it.

545
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:04,695
Thanks for opening up.

546
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:09,233
So let's talk
about the Harrisons, then.

547
00:40:09,235 --> 00:40:11,402
Either of them
screwing around on the side?

548
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:14,138
I don't know. Is anybody
happily married these days?

549
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:19,177
These have already
been gone through.

550
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:22,613
Right. He was supposed
to get off at 11:30.

551
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:26,483
Right. Mr. Harrison.

552
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:29,720
So you don't know if Mr. Harrison
even came to work or not.

553
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:31,222
Hold on one second.

554
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:34,225
Did you know she worked as a
dental hygienist for a Dr. Shider?

555
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:35,927
Really? No.

556
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:39,077
I'm going to pay him a visit.
You want to come?

557
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,889
Okay.

558
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:43,034
Okay. Thanks.

559
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:45,102
So she quit yesterday?

560
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:48,840
Well, kind of.
Ann Merai had terminal cancer.

561
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:50,774
Really?

562
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:53,344
I think she was trying
to keep it quiet.

563
00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:55,663
Anything else
you could tell us?

564
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:59,450
I think she was
having an affair.

565
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:03,638
Did she actually tell you
she was having an affair?

566
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,289
We don't really talk a lot,

567
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,424
mainly what's happening
on our stories

568
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:08,926
and stuff like that,

569
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:11,462
but I just got the feeling.

570
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:14,298
Like, sometimes when
she'd be on the phone,

571
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,901
she would talk real quiet.

572
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:18,069
Whisper?

573
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,772
Did you ever see him,

574
00:41:21,774 --> 00:41:24,208
or did she ever
tell you who he was?

575
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:29,080
No, no.
But--but he was classy.

576
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:33,484
About a week ago, she got this big
thing of flowers from Rosie's.

577
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:35,586
Really nice.
It was beautiful.

578
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:37,054
Remember, Bruce?

579
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:39,423
But I met her husband once,

580
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:43,060
and he just doesn't seem
like the type to send flowers.

581
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:44,528
Right.

582
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:49,600
Rosie! Chief Whitlock.

583
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:53,104
Listen, we're trying to find out
if some flowers were sent

584
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:58,075
to an Ann Merai Harrison
last week, sent to her office.

585
00:41:58,077 --> 00:42:01,245
Harrison. Check and see
if one of your guys sent them.

586
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:02,280
<i>What hospital?</i>

587
00:42:02,282 --> 00:42:03,514
Mercy Med.

588
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:04,515
Ah!

589
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,019
Chris Harrison.
Her husband.

590
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,954
Okay. Thanks a lot, Rosie.

591
00:42:09,956 --> 00:42:11,688
Yeah. No, that's all.

592
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,624
Okay. Thank you, Rosie.

593
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,592
<i>If you'd like to make a call...</i>

594
00:42:17,462 --> 00:42:19,096
You ready?

595
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:22,266
I guess so.

596
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:23,634
Okay. All right.

597
00:42:23,636 --> 00:42:24,969
Thank you for your help.

598
00:42:24,971 --> 00:42:26,603
Sure.
Thank you.

599
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:31,208
If you think of anything else,
here's my card. Thanks a lot.

600
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:36,914
Please don't do me like that.
You knew I wasn't finished.

601
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,816
I'm sorry.

602
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:41,518
Dr. Shider gave me the name
of Ann Merai's doctor.

603
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,688
I want to find out more
about her cancer.

604
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:48,225
You can drop me off
back at the station.

605
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:51,028
You really don't like
being around me, do you?

606
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,496
No, no. I just, you know...

607
00:42:52,498 --> 00:42:54,631
There isn't any reason
for both of us

608
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,784
to be wasting time
at the doctor's office.

609
00:42:56,786 --> 00:42:58,569
What's so pressing
that you have to do?

610
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:01,272
I do have a job.
I am chief of police.

611
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:04,141
Yeah, of a four-person
department, Matt.

612
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:06,510
See, that's the problem
between the two of us.

613
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:09,080
You think your job
is more important than my job.

614
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:11,082
Never said that.
Yeah, you did.

615
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:14,585
You never say it directly,
but in indirect ways you say it.

616
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:16,553
You wanted to leave
Banyan Key, go to Miami

617
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:19,556
so we could be closer
to <i>your</i> important job.

618
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:21,558
You never said the commute
was taking time away from us?

619
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,527
I didn't have a problem with that.
You didn't?

620
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:27,031
So I'm hearing things now?
Whatever.

621
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:29,333
Is that the reason
you're not coming with me?

622
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:31,402
Is that your date paging you?

623
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:34,138
One of my four officers checked in.
It's a tracking device.

624
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,906
And you can tell on that?

625
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:39,627
That's what it tells me. GPS.
We're all tied in to it.

626
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:41,144
The mayor's brother sells them,

627
00:43:41,146 --> 00:43:42,746
so we spent
half the budget on them.

628
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:46,634
See, if we were moving,
you'd see it tracking.

629
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:48,185
Sorry.

630
00:43:48,187 --> 00:43:50,921
If we were moving right now,
it would show us tracking.

631
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,189
Great.

632
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,058
Why don't we drive
to the doctor's office,

633
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,160
and I can see how it works?

634
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:00,464
Okay.
Okay.

635
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:04,735
Thank you.

636
00:44:22,387 --> 00:44:25,822
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll meet you in there.

637
00:44:25,824 --> 00:44:27,691
Hi.
May I help you?

638
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:29,793
Yeah. Dr. Donovan's office.

639
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:31,929
Her office
is on the third floor.

640
00:44:31,931 --> 00:44:33,764
Thank you, Ramona.

641
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:38,402
Ann Harrison
didn't have cancer.

642
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,388
Are you sure?

643
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,474
Not counting the time
she spent in Atlanta,

644
00:44:43,476 --> 00:44:45,909
Ann Merai has been my patient
since Junior high school.

645
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:48,412
If she had cancer,
I would have known.

646
00:44:49,281 --> 00:44:50,847
I don't get it.

647
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:54,401
Maybe she saw
another doctor.

648
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:56,253
She was here for her yearly

649
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:58,822
when she first got back to town
two months ago,

650
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:01,058
and she was healthy
as a proverbial horse.

651
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,263
I'm looking it
over here, and...

652
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:08,932
I don't understand.
Who told you she had cancer?

653
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:10,033
Excuse me.

654
00:45:14,772 --> 00:45:16,073
So...

655
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,574
Can I help you?

656
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:55,379
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dr. Frieland.

657
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:57,498
You're looking at him.

658
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:00,467
You're Dr. Frieland?

659
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,354
Yes, I am.

660
00:46:03,356 --> 00:46:04,388
Hold on, pop.

661
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:07,057
You're sure?
This is your office?

662
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,093
It has been
for ten years, yes.

663
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,862
Look, I'll get back to you.

664
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:14,765
Do you have a patient named
Ann Merai Harrison?

665
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,833
I really can't
tell you that.

666
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:19,703
You can tell me.
Was she your patient or not?

667
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:21,572
Was she
your patient or not?

668
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:22,873
You don't understand--

669
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,842
was she
your patient or not?

670
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:29,446
No, I've never had
a patient by that name.

671
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:32,383
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure, very sure.

672
00:46:32,385 --> 00:46:34,685
Yeah, I would know that.

673
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:36,019
Okay, I'm sorry.

674
00:46:39,023 --> 00:46:41,425
That your pen?

675
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:43,627
Pen? Yes.

676
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:45,929
Do you use it much?

677
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,565
No, not very much.

678
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:49,733
You don't mind
if I take it, do you?

679
00:46:49,735 --> 00:46:53,671
No, you can have the pen.
Sure. It's yours.

680
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:57,941
Take it. It's yours.

681
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:13,624
Right.

682
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:16,493
Right.

683
00:47:16,495 --> 00:47:19,162
I know that part.
Hang on one sec.

684
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,434
Did you get a checkup
or something?

685
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,369
No, just bad coffee.

686
00:47:26,438 --> 00:47:28,672
All right.

687
00:47:28,674 --> 00:47:31,275
No, just tell them they've
got to stop lagging.

688
00:47:31,277 --> 00:47:33,277
We need
those phone records now.

689
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:35,011
All right. Thanks.

690
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:40,183
You all right?
Yeah.

691
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:43,053
We all good? Fantastic.

692
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:59,403
How's this, ma'am?

693
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:02,072
You fixed his nose already?
Just wonderful.

694
00:48:02,074 --> 00:48:03,507
Hey, chief.

695
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:07,411
Hey.

696
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:09,045
How you doing, Judy?

697
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:11,415
I'm fine, thanks,
considering...

698
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:14,285
Alex, we've got
an eyewitness here.

699
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:17,954
Mr. Anderson, this is
detective Diaz-Whitlock.

700
00:48:17,956 --> 00:48:21,625
Well, just...
We're on top of it.

701
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:23,727
Chief, I told them how
Judy's ma saw somebody

702
00:48:23,729 --> 00:48:26,062
sneaking around the
Harrison place last night.

703
00:48:26,064 --> 00:48:28,532
Got them right over there
sketching it out for us.

704
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:30,467
...the guy she saw
outside her window...

705
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:34,354
That's her right there?
Okay, all right. Good job, T.

706
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:37,040
Chief,
check this out.

707
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:39,976
Sketch of a prowler out to
the Harrison's last night.

708
00:48:39,978 --> 00:48:41,512
Yeah.

709
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:42,979
Ring any bells?

710
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:43,847
Hi, Tony.

711
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:48,652
No. I mean, no.

712
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:51,588
He looked like him.

713
00:48:52,857 --> 00:48:54,792
Like who?
Like him.

714
00:48:56,227 --> 00:48:57,528
Like me?

715
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,962
Yeah, yeah. You.

716
00:49:03,935 --> 00:49:06,837
Mom, he's the chief of police.

717
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:10,073
So he was black, ma'am?
Yeah, he was black.

718
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:12,643
Wait a minute.
Maybe...

719
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:13,844
Maybe him.

720
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:18,114
Mrs. Anderson, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

721
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,784
Anyway...

722
00:49:20,786 --> 00:49:22,786
I'm so sorry.

723
00:49:22,788 --> 00:49:24,988
Mother was raised
in a different time.

724
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,225
Don't worry about it.
We're on top of it, okay?

725
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:30,077
I need to talk to you.

726
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,462
I appreciate you
coming down.

727
00:49:31,464 --> 00:49:33,263
I am so embarrassed.

728
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:37,368
Please, you've got to stop.

729
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,937
I want you to take this
up to Miami for me, okay?

730
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:44,040
I want you to give it
to a detective Gissen.

731
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:45,709
Gissen?
Gissen, right.

732
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:47,745
I'm going to give you
his phone number.

733
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:49,747
Tell him
I need prints on that asap.

734
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:51,248
Is it for this thing?

735
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,249
Yeah.

736
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:54,951
<i>Excuse me, chief.</i>
Yeah.

737
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:57,771
<i>An agent Stark from the DEA</i>
<i>is on line one for you.</i>

738
00:49:57,773 --> 00:49:59,055
Who?

739
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:01,725
<i>Agent Stark. Said it's about</i>
<i>the Scarcetti case.</i>

740
00:50:07,732 --> 00:50:09,266
Thank you.

741
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:10,834
Yeah.

742
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:14,137
Chief Whitlock.

743
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,640
<i>Agent Stark, DEA.</i>
<i>How you doing?</i>

744
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:19,075
Busy.
<i>You and me both, pal.</i>

745
00:50:19,077 --> 00:50:22,178
<i>I understand you guys are holding
the evidence in the Scarcetti case.</i>

746
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,346
Uh-huh.

747
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:27,418
<i>Great. That makes you</i>
<i>my new best friend.</i>

748
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,753
<i>I'm going to send a couple
agents this afternoon</i>

749
00:50:29,755 --> 00:50:31,154
<i>to pick up that cash.</i>

750
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:33,290
<i>We think</i>
<i>it was used last year</i>

751
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:35,459
<i>in a sting operation</i>
<i>with Paolo Estaban.</i>

752
00:50:35,461 --> 00:50:38,395
If we can tie the serial numbers
to the bills you guys have,

753
00:50:38,397 --> 00:50:39,963
we can tie Estaban to Scarcetti.

754
00:50:39,965 --> 00:50:42,165
<i>This is of top priority</i>
<i>for us, chief.</i>

755
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,802
<i>With this evidence, we can kill</i>
<i>two birds with one stone,</i>

756
00:50:44,804 --> 00:50:46,437
<i>nail Estaban and Scarcetti.</i>

757
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:50,441
Why don't I call you tomorrow,
and we figure out a time--

758
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:52,943
<i>whoa! This had to be done</i>
<i>the day before yesterday.</i>

759
00:50:52,945 --> 00:50:54,611
<i>We got a court date</i>
<i>next week.</i>

760
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:56,680
The evidence has to stay
in my possession

761
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:58,281
until the appeals
process is over.

762
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:00,851
<i>I didn't call you to get a lecture
on the rules of evidence.</i>

763
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:02,385
We, i.e..,
the United States government,

764
00:51:02,387 --> 00:51:05,556
need to check
the serial numbers on that cash.

765
00:51:05,558 --> 00:51:07,958
<i>When I hang up on you</i>
<i>in ten seconds,</i>

766
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,794
<i>I want you to type up</i>
<i>a chain of evidence receipt.</i>

767
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:14,397
<i>One of my men will be happy</i>
<i>to sign it for you.</i>

768
00:51:14,399 --> 00:51:17,033
Oh, yeah, and, chief...
Yeah?

769
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,368
It's been ten seconds.

770
00:51:26,143 --> 00:51:27,911
Chief, you okay?

771
00:51:27,913 --> 00:51:29,580
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

772
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:35,185
Just tell Gissen that I need
those prints really quick.

773
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:37,220
I'm sure Alex can--

774
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:39,189
we don't want
to give them to Alex.

775
00:51:39,191 --> 00:51:40,557
Sorry. I just thought--

776
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,758
just do it!

777
00:51:43,528 --> 00:51:46,663
All right. Okay.

778
00:51:46,665 --> 00:51:48,932
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.

779
00:51:48,934 --> 00:51:50,467
Just--just go there,
stay there,

780
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:53,003
and call me as soon
as they're done.

781
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:54,270
You got it.

782
00:52:04,649 --> 00:52:09,019
No, I've been on hold.
When should I call back?

783
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,286
Okay. Thanks.

784
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,559
Here you go.

785
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:22,365
Bast, my phone records!

786
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:25,368
How long can it take to fax over
a few sheets of paper?

787
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,303
I'll call them again.

788
00:52:27,305 --> 00:52:30,306
Alex, I think
we've got something here.

789
00:52:30,308 --> 00:52:32,326
What?

790
00:52:32,328 --> 00:52:34,845
Look at this entry into the
checkbook, that last one.

791
00:52:36,748 --> 00:52:38,415
Is this the only
entry you found?

792
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,083
So far,
but it's a new register.

793
00:52:40,085 --> 00:52:42,085
What's going on?

794
00:52:42,087 --> 00:52:43,921
Hey. Looks like they got
a life insurance policy,

795
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:46,256
and we've got
a potential murder.

796
00:52:46,258 --> 00:52:50,761
There's got to be tons of these
life insurance companies, right?

797
00:52:50,763 --> 00:52:52,162
Right.

798
00:52:52,164 --> 00:52:54,264
You got any pull at the bank?
Sure.

799
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:57,300
You want me to get an address?
Please.

800
00:52:59,604 --> 00:53:02,539
Hey, Sharlene, you know
that report I gave you?

801
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:20,757
They're not going to
be able to run them

802
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:22,192
for another half an hour.

803
00:53:22,194 --> 00:53:24,194
<i>Call me when</i>
<i>you've got something.</i>

804
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:27,130
<i>T.</i>
Shit.

805
00:53:27,132 --> 00:53:29,199
You should see the rack

806
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:31,401
<i>on this chick</i>
<i>that just walked by.</i>

807
00:53:31,403 --> 00:53:32,636
Just call me, T.

808
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,083
Those my phone records?
No, just a fax for me.

809
00:53:46,085 --> 00:53:48,986
Bast, what's up with my fax?
It's not here.

810
00:53:48,988 --> 00:53:51,287
She said she sent them.
Who's "she"?

811
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:53,156
Miss white.
Who's Miss white?

812
00:53:53,158 --> 00:53:56,443
She's a supervisor over there.
I've dealt with her before.

813
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:58,061
Call Miss white back,
'cause they're not here.

814
00:53:58,063 --> 00:54:00,563
I talked to her
a couple of minutes ago.

815
00:54:00,565 --> 00:54:01,698
Detective...

816
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,002
Well, she assured me
that she sent them.

817
00:54:05,004 --> 00:54:08,038
We need to call her back
and actually have her wait

818
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,008
as we see the fax
coming through.

819
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,409
Sure, boss. Be happy to.

820
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:23,437
Miss white?

821
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:25,255
This is detective Bast
with Miami-Dade.

822
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:28,825
Yeah, I just spoke to you about
the Harrison phone records.

823
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:31,011
I haven't received them yet.

824
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:33,263
What do you mean
you sent them?

825
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:36,066
I'm staring at the fax machine,
and it's not there.

826
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:38,334
I'm going to stand
right in front of it,

827
00:54:38,336 --> 00:54:41,004
and if I don't hear
the phone ring in 30 seconds,

828
00:54:41,006 --> 00:54:42,739
I'm going to your superiors.

829
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:44,941
Do I need to be
more clear than that?

830
00:54:44,943 --> 00:54:48,011
Can I use your computer?
Couple of minutes.

831
00:54:48,013 --> 00:54:50,814
They just e-mailed me a bunch
of warrants I need to look up.

832
00:54:50,816 --> 00:54:52,482
60 seconds.
Chief--

833
00:54:52,484 --> 00:54:54,450
I'm not raising
my voice!

834
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,666
You got writer's block.

835
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:11,835
No, just working
on my report.

836
00:55:11,837 --> 00:55:14,705
On what?
On somebody jaywalking?

837
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:17,373
Yeah, someone was jaywalking
or urinating on the sidewalk

838
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,375
or throwing spitballs
at a crossing guard.

839
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:21,644
I know it's a small office,
but it's my office.

840
00:55:22,915 --> 00:55:24,431
Phone records
coming in. Alex!

841
00:55:28,169 --> 00:55:29,252
Is this it?

842
00:55:29,254 --> 00:55:30,320
It says "receiving."

843
00:55:36,828 --> 00:55:38,512
Oh, shit.
It's out of paper.

844
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:40,897
You're kidding me.
Oh, God.

845
00:55:40,899 --> 00:55:42,833
Could we get
some paper, Sharlene?

846
00:55:42,835 --> 00:55:45,435
Anybody got any paper?
Paper, folks!

847
00:55:45,437 --> 00:55:46,970
Don't all move at once.

848
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:49,405
Anybody in Banyan Key
have any paper?

849
00:55:49,407 --> 00:55:51,641
It's about 8 1/2 by 11 inches.
Little rectangle.

850
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,376
Here you go.

851
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,164
What do you do? "Start"?

852
00:56:16,267 --> 00:56:17,333
Here it comes.

853
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:24,274
We've got a little problem
with this machine.

854
00:56:24,276 --> 00:56:26,609
It's fine, fine.

855
00:56:26,611 --> 00:56:28,278
Great. Thank you.

856
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,213
Let me just get over here.

857
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,051
I hate this thing.

858
00:56:36,921 --> 00:56:38,889
Here.

859
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:41,575
There we go. "Start."

860
00:56:41,577 --> 00:56:43,459
Hah! There we go.

861
00:56:47,832 --> 00:56:50,200
I can't read this.
It's the toner.

862
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:52,836
Have her re-fax it.
It's okay.

863
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:55,939
I can read it. It's okay.
No, fax it again.

864
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:57,908
That says Barry Thomas.

865
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,576
A friend of Chris' from high school.
I know him.

866
00:57:00,578 --> 00:57:03,880
That one is Will Blount.
You guys okay?

867
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:05,148
It's okay.

868
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,017
This one is Frank Rhodes.

869
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:08,218
Frank Rhodes.

870
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:12,204
No. All the boxes
go to Miami.

871
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:15,507
So the last call they made was
to American airlines at 8 P.M.

872
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:17,709
Hey. Got a surprise for you.

873
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:19,278
Both of them already dead

874
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,880
when somebody
turned them into s'mores.

875
00:57:20,882 --> 00:57:22,714
What?
Both of them?

876
00:57:22,716 --> 00:57:24,716
No sign of smoke
in their lungs.

877
00:57:24,718 --> 00:57:27,386
Come on. If they'd been alive
when that place went up,

878
00:57:27,388 --> 00:57:29,488
their lungs
would look like mine.

879
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:32,892
Alex, here are
the cell phone records.

880
00:57:32,894 --> 00:57:34,093
Cell phone?

881
00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:36,795
They're on a different database
than the land lines.

882
00:57:36,797 --> 00:57:39,631
"Town of Banyan Key."

883
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:42,167
"12:34 A.M."

884
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:46,005
305-555-0199?

885
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,609
What time did grandma say
she saw that prowler?

886
00:57:50,611 --> 00:57:51,944
After <i>Leno.</i>

887
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:55,047
What time's <i>Leno</i> over?
Like 12:00, 12:30?

888
00:57:55,049 --> 00:57:56,115
Hello?

889
00:57:56,117 --> 00:57:58,250
This might be our guy.

890
00:57:58,252 --> 00:58:00,419
How many phone calls
do you get after midnight?

891
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:02,087
Must be a bad connection.

892
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:05,925
All right.
555-0199.

893
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,628
Come on, come on.

894
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:22,007
Yeah. Okay.

895
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:24,810
Let me see if I can find
the number for you.

896
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,182
I don't know who it is.

897
00:58:30,184 --> 00:58:32,551
<i>The Nextel subscriber
you are trying to reach</i>

898
00:58:32,553 --> 00:58:36,055
<i>is outside the service area.</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>

899
00:58:36,057 --> 00:58:38,708
No, I don't have it.

900
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,993
Whoever it is works
for the town of Banyan Key.

901
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:43,228
How do we find out
whose phone this is?

902
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,165
- All right, I'll...
- Just ask.

903
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,100
Is there anybody
even in Banyan Key?

904
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:51,370
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

905
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,342
Hey, Alex?

906
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:58,110
I'm sorry,

907
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:00,612
I was drifting off there.
What'd you say that number was?

908
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:02,481
555-0199.

909
00:59:02,483 --> 00:59:05,317
0199?

910
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:07,052
You're sure it's not 1099?

911
00:59:07,054 --> 00:59:09,054
Chae, 0199.

912
00:59:09,056 --> 00:59:13,025
0199? That's weird.
That's my cell phone number.

913
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:14,777
Yours?

914
00:59:14,779 --> 00:59:16,695
Yeah.
Aren't you county?

915
00:59:16,697 --> 00:59:20,565
I work part-time as a paramedic--
football games, school stuff.

916
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:22,401
And you called him
last night?

917
00:59:22,403 --> 00:59:25,704
I don't know.
Did I...

918
00:59:25,706 --> 00:59:29,575
Oh, Jesus, I did
call him last night.

919
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:31,043
I called him from the bar.

920
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:34,213
I wanted to see if he wanted
to have a couple of drinks.

921
00:59:34,215 --> 00:59:37,082
You're friends with him?
I wouldn't say that.

922
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:40,052
He's, like,
my bottom-of-the-list guy

923
00:59:40,054 --> 00:59:42,654
when you've got to have
somebody to drink with.

924
00:59:42,656 --> 00:59:45,424
I would have mentioned it.
I totally forgot.

925
00:59:45,426 --> 00:59:48,593
You should have told me this
at the scene, Chae.

926
00:59:48,595 --> 00:59:51,563
I'm sorry. I don't remember
too much about last night.

927
00:59:51,565 --> 00:59:54,133
I had a fight with Barbara.
I was in no good shape.

928
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:56,402
Check with the bartender.
I closed the place,

929
00:59:56,404 --> 00:59:58,504
staggered home,
passed out next to my wife.

930
00:59:58,506 --> 01:00:03,242
I didn't move until I got the
call to show up at the scene.

931
01:00:03,244 --> 01:00:05,244
I need a statement.

932
01:00:05,246 --> 01:00:08,514
I'll give you
a statement right now.

933
01:00:08,516 --> 01:00:10,349
What's the matter with you?

934
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:13,885
You're like a love child
of Barney fife and Joe Friday.

935
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:15,154
All right, a statement.

936
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:32,438
What the hell was that about?
I was sleeping with her.

937
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,705
Jesus.

938
01:00:33,707 --> 01:00:35,524
So you...

939
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:38,310
No, but it was all a plan,
them coming back here.

940
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:40,663
They set me up.
They planned the whole thing.

941
01:00:40,665 --> 01:00:42,647
What plan?
What do you mean?

942
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:46,151
I gave her
the Scarcetti money.

943
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:48,087
God!

944
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:51,156
Would you have given it to me
if I slept with you?

945
01:00:55,562 --> 01:00:58,163
Any trace of the money?
None.

946
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:01,300
I thought I had
trouble with women.

947
01:01:01,302 --> 01:01:03,235
Maybe you should
just tell her.

948
01:01:03,237 --> 01:01:04,736
Who, Alex?
Yeah. Tell Alex.

949
01:01:04,738 --> 01:01:08,240
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they got on me.

950
01:01:08,242 --> 01:01:10,842
Motive--Ann Merai names me
beneficiary on her insurance policy,

951
01:01:10,844 --> 01:01:12,844
and I was having
an affair with her.

952
01:01:12,846 --> 01:01:14,879
Opportunity--
an eyewitness saw me

953
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:17,216
outside their house
the night it blew up.

954
01:01:17,218 --> 01:01:19,318
You want to hear some more?

955
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,385
Alibi.

956
01:01:20,387 --> 01:01:22,020
Home, by myself.

957
01:01:22,022 --> 01:01:24,956
That good? At least you changed
your cell phone number.

958
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:26,958
Even if Alex
wanted to believe me,

959
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,627
there's so much evidence
against me,

960
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:30,061
she'd have to turn me in.

961
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:31,863
You're right.

962
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:34,233
That'd kill any chance you had
of getting back together.

963
01:01:34,235 --> 01:01:35,467
What?

964
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:38,003
She says, "let's call
the divorce off."

965
01:01:38,005 --> 01:01:42,040
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at murder charges.

966
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:44,876
The gal's a peach. I don't
know what you were thinking.

967
01:01:44,878 --> 01:01:46,445
Never mind. Forget it.

968
01:01:47,514 --> 01:01:48,847
Can I do anything?

969
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:51,183
You don't think obstruction
of justice is enough?

970
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:53,185
I'm on a roll.

971
01:01:54,237 --> 01:01:55,654
Chief Whitlock.

972
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:57,055
They matched the prints
on the pen.

973
01:01:57,057 --> 01:02:00,225
The guy's name is Paul Cabot.
He's done time before.

974
01:02:00,227 --> 01:02:02,394
They got his prints
from a criminal database.

975
01:02:02,396 --> 01:02:04,163
You got an address?

976
01:02:04,165 --> 01:02:08,400
<i>Yeah. 36 Reef Road,</i>
<i>in Kendall.</i>

977
01:02:36,196 --> 01:02:37,796
All right, come on.

978
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:40,299
Hurry up.

979
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:54,813
You want a beer?

980
01:02:54,815 --> 01:02:56,381
Nah, I'm okay.

981
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:31,450
Ho ho ho.

982
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:34,886
What tangled webs we weave...

983
01:03:34,888 --> 01:03:35,987
What you got?

984
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:37,822
Your doctor
worked at the hospital,

985
01:03:37,824 --> 01:03:39,858
but seems he was
in my line of work.

986
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,460
Son of a gun.

987
01:03:41,462 --> 01:03:43,161
Let's get out of here.

988
01:03:43,163 --> 01:03:45,530
Let me get the beer.
Chae, come on, let's go.

989
01:03:45,532 --> 01:03:47,366
Come on. I've got
to get the beer.

990
01:03:47,368 --> 01:03:50,736
A beer in the hand
is worth two in the fridge.

991
01:04:02,848 --> 01:04:04,015
What are you doing?

992
01:04:04,017 --> 01:04:07,886
Bottom of the ninth.
Down by a lot of runs.

993
01:04:07,888 --> 01:04:10,855
I got about
ten grand in the bank.

994
01:04:10,857 --> 01:04:14,826
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.

995
01:04:14,828 --> 01:04:16,628
You think I'm done?

996
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,862
Mmm...

997
01:04:17,864 --> 01:04:20,582
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not running.

998
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:22,334
No. The idea
was I drive you.

999
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:26,237
Yeah, you can drive me.
Drive me back to the station.

1000
01:04:28,007 --> 01:04:29,541
All right.
All right.

1001
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,021
Got your insurance company
on the line.

1002
01:04:43,023 --> 01:04:44,989
<i>That policy number</i>
<i>corresponds to</i>

1003
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:47,526
<i>a $1 million</i>
<i>term life insurance policy</i>

1004
01:04:47,528 --> 01:04:49,194
<i>for an Ann Merai Harrison.</i>

1005
01:04:49,196 --> 01:04:50,796
Any messages there for me?

1006
01:04:51,864 --> 01:04:53,932
Who's the beneficiary?

1007
01:04:53,934 --> 01:04:55,934
<i>Just a moment here.</i>

1008
01:05:00,206 --> 01:05:01,440
<i>Let's see.</i>

1009
01:05:01,442 --> 01:05:06,578
<i>Looks like the beneficiary</i>
<i>is listed as...</i>

1010
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:12,116
<i>Chris Harrison,</i>
<i>her husband.</i>

1011
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:18,156
All right, thank you.
You've been really helpful.

1012
01:05:18,158 --> 01:05:21,159
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't be more--</i>
<i>wait a minute.</i>

1013
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:23,161
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I got a note here.</i>

1014
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:27,065
<i>It seems the policy holder</i>
<i>requested a form</i>

1015
01:05:27,067 --> 01:05:29,368
<i>to change the beneficiary</i>
<i>last week.</i>

1016
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,403
So she changed it?

1017
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:34,138
<i>Yeah, and if she did,</i>
<i>it's not in the system yet.</i>

1018
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,875
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail or...

1019
01:05:36,877 --> 01:05:39,177
<i>It could be downstairs</i>
<i>in our processing center.</i>

1020
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:41,813
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?

1021
01:05:41,815 --> 01:05:43,849
<i>I think they're</i>
<i>still out to lunch.</i>

1022
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:46,585
All right, so call back
in half an hour?

1023
01:05:46,587 --> 01:05:48,219
<i>Sure, why not?</i>

1024
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:49,454
Thank you.

1025
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:56,595
<i>This is Bill.</i>

1026
01:05:56,597 --> 01:05:57,929
How you doing, Bill?

1027
01:05:57,931 --> 01:06:01,032
<i>Good. What have you</i>
<i>been up to?</i>

1028
01:06:01,034 --> 01:06:03,869
You got no idea.
Let me ask you a favor.

1029
01:06:03,871 --> 01:06:06,872
I've got
a credit-card statement,

1030
01:06:06,874 --> 01:06:08,807
capitol one
credit-card statement

1031
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:10,341
on a Paul Cabot.

1032
01:06:10,343 --> 01:06:13,144
I need you to find out the
last place he used his card.

1033
01:06:13,146 --> 01:06:14,479
I got something for you.

1034
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:15,980
<i>C-A-B-O-T?</i>
Yeah.

1035
01:06:15,982 --> 01:06:17,783
<i>Can you hold?</i>
Yeah. No problem.

1036
01:06:17,785 --> 01:06:20,452
I found this under the seat
of one of the Harrison's cars.

1037
01:06:20,454 --> 01:06:22,487
It's a bank card receipt
to a gas station

1038
01:06:22,489 --> 01:06:24,756
used by a guy named Paul Cabot.

1039
01:06:24,758 --> 01:06:27,392
Nice.
Check the phone records.

1040
01:06:27,394 --> 01:06:29,093
Already on it.
Paul Cabot.

1041
01:06:29,095 --> 01:06:32,497
Anybody know or ever heard
of a Paul Cabot?

1042
01:06:32,499 --> 01:06:35,133
Come on, people, wake up.

1043
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:37,436
Yes? No?

1044
01:06:37,438 --> 01:06:38,470
No.

1045
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:39,971
Paul Cabot?

1046
01:06:39,973 --> 01:06:42,541
Frank, call the bank,
see what they've got.

1047
01:06:42,543 --> 01:06:45,677
No records of any incoming or
outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.

1048
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:47,646
Check every restaurant,
gas station...

1049
01:06:47,648 --> 01:06:49,147
<i>Matt?</i>

1050
01:06:49,149 --> 01:06:51,349
Yeah, Bill?
<i>I've got something.</i>

1051
01:06:51,351 --> 01:06:54,519
If this guy took a piss
and paid for it, I want to know.

1052
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:57,689
<i>He's got a reservation</i>
<i>at the Costa Coral Hotel.</i>

1053
01:06:57,691 --> 01:06:59,390
There's a hold on it now?

1054
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:00,725
<i>He checked in yesterday.</i>

1055
01:07:00,727 --> 01:07:02,861
Costa Coral hotel.
<i>You know where it is?</i>

1056
01:07:02,863 --> 01:07:04,863
Yeah. On Atlantic Avenue.
<i>Yeah.</i>

1057
01:07:04,865 --> 01:07:07,098
You're a lifesaver.

1058
01:07:17,844 --> 01:07:19,444
Chief Whitlock?
Yeah.

1059
01:07:19,446 --> 01:07:21,279
Agent white.
This is Agent Fetzer.

1060
01:07:21,281 --> 01:07:23,482
We're here to pick up
the Scarcetti money.

1061
01:07:23,484 --> 01:07:27,586
Agent Stark said to send
the money to his office.

1062
01:07:27,588 --> 01:07:29,420
My guy left five minutes ago.

1063
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:32,591
He told you we'd pick it up.
He said send it to his office.

1064
01:07:32,593 --> 01:07:34,893
He told you to send
the money to the office?

1065
01:07:34,895 --> 01:07:36,160
He'll tell you.

1066
01:07:36,162 --> 01:07:37,696
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

1067
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:39,230
He wants to talk to you.

1068
01:07:39,232 --> 01:07:40,815
Hello.

1069
01:07:40,817 --> 01:07:42,534
What the hell is your problem?

1070
01:07:42,536 --> 01:07:44,369
I told you to get that
money ready,

1071
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:46,571
<i>that I was sending agents--</i>
you said--

1072
01:07:46,573 --> 01:07:48,607
what are you, a parrot,
telling me what I said?

1073
01:07:48,609 --> 01:07:50,008
I know what I said.

1074
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:53,011
No, I'm not a parrot.
I know what you said.

1075
01:07:53,013 --> 01:07:54,779
Then where the hell
is the money?

1076
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:57,165
If you shut up
for five minutes,

1077
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:59,050
I can tell you
where the money is.

1078
01:07:59,052 --> 01:08:02,721
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.

1079
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:05,089
<i>He should be up there</i>
<i>in about an hour.</i>

1080
01:08:05,091 --> 01:08:08,159
<i>If you have a problem with that</i>
<i>after I hang up in ten seconds,</i>

1081
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:10,529
call your partners at the IRS,
tell them to audit me.

1082
01:08:10,531 --> 01:08:11,963
You little bastard!

1083
01:08:11,965 --> 01:08:13,832
<i>Agent Stark,</i>
<i>Agent Stark.</i>

1084
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:15,317
What? What?

1085
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:16,601
I meant five seconds.

1086
01:08:16,603 --> 01:08:17,903
<i>Damn it, chief!</i>

1087
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:20,238
Sorry, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

1088
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,174
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

1089
01:08:23,176 --> 01:08:25,076
Sorry about your phone.

1090
01:08:25,078 --> 01:08:27,012
Can you hear me now?

1091
01:08:29,715 --> 01:08:31,800
<i>Chief, can you hear me?</i>

1092
01:08:31,802 --> 01:08:34,586
<i>Costa Coral hotel.
Good afternoon.</i>

1093
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:36,588
I just checked in
to your hotel.

1094
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:38,623
I'm trying to access
my voice mail.

1095
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,892
<i>You're not in your room.</i>
I'm on my cell phone.

1096
01:08:40,894 --> 01:08:42,293
<i>Okay, that's no problem.</i>

1097
01:08:42,295 --> 01:08:45,263
Can you help me?
<i>Sure. What's your room number?</i>

1098
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:47,665
I don't remember.
I just checked in.

1099
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:49,735
<i>What's your name?</i>
Paul Cabot.

1100
01:08:49,737 --> 01:08:51,770
<i>Okay, please hold.</i>

1101
01:08:51,772 --> 01:08:53,171
<i>You're in room 715.</i>

1102
01:08:53,173 --> 01:08:55,073
715. Okay, thank you.

1103
01:08:55,075 --> 01:08:56,742
<i>To access</i>
<i>your voice mail...</i>

1104
01:08:56,744 --> 01:09:00,011
Alex, we've got a Paul Cabot
at a Costa Coral hotel in Miami.

1105
01:09:00,013 --> 01:09:01,479
It's on Atlantic.

1106
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:35,113
You're supposed to be here already.
<i>These people work slow.</i>

1107
01:09:35,115 --> 01:09:36,509
Did you get those things?

1108
01:09:36,535 --> 01:09:38,850
<i>Yeah. You got a TV?
Watch pay-per-view.</i>

1109
01:09:38,852 --> 01:09:42,254
<i>Forget pay-per-view.
You got your wife under control?</i>

1110
01:09:42,256 --> 01:09:44,222
<i>Is she cool?</i>
<i>She's not gonna...</i>

1111
01:09:44,224 --> 01:09:47,358
She's not talking to nobody.
She's not going nowhere.

1112
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,494
She's got too much to lose.

1113
01:09:49,496 --> 01:09:50,962
<i>All right.</i>

1114
01:09:50,964 --> 01:09:53,698
Damn, man.
You take a terrible picture.

1115
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,168
<i>Get yourself over here.</i>
<i>We've gotta get out of town.</i>

1116
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,535
Right, right.

1117
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,205
Excuse me.
How you doing?

1118
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:03,241
I left my key up in my room.
A knucklehead.

1119
01:10:03,243 --> 01:10:05,743
715. It's Cabot.

1120
01:10:05,745 --> 01:10:07,763
Paul Cabot, 715.

1121
01:10:07,765 --> 01:10:09,631
Happens all the time,
Mr. Cabot.

1122
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:11,382
Thank you.

1123
01:10:42,748 --> 01:10:43,849
Paul?

1124
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:50,655
Paul Cabot, it's the police.

1125
01:10:57,331 --> 01:10:59,998
<i>And I fully</i>
<i>support that, you know that?</i>

1126
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
<i>Absolutely,</i>
<i>but the thing is...</i>

1127
01:11:02,002 --> 01:11:05,270
<i>If I'm gonna be a senator</i>
<i>by the time I'm 30,</i>

1128
01:11:05,272 --> 01:11:07,672
<i>I need to start</i>
<i>thinking now.</i>

1129
01:11:14,446 --> 01:11:17,148
<i>One of the reasons I wanted</i>
<i>to come here tonight</i>

1130
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,750
<i>was to discuss our future.</i>

1131
01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:22,020
<i>I am fully amenable</i>
<i>to that discussion.</i>

1132
01:11:23,389 --> 01:11:26,191
<i>We've been having</i>
<i>all kinds of fun lately.</i>

1133
01:11:26,193 --> 01:11:29,694
<i>Well, Harvard</i>
<i>is gonna be different.</i>

1134
01:11:29,696 --> 01:11:32,697
<i>Law school is a very</i>
<i>different world, and...</i>

1135
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:34,799
<i>And I need to be serious.</i>

1136
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:36,301
<i>Of course.</i>

1137
01:12:25,584 --> 01:12:26,501
Oh, fuck...

1138
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:15,400
<i>403, request</i>
<i>for driver's license info...</i>

1139
01:13:26,678 --> 01:13:28,246
There's somebody up there!
What?

1140
01:13:28,248 --> 01:13:31,949
There's somebody up there!
Oh, my God!

1141
01:13:37,523 --> 01:13:38,706
Where?

1142
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:58,743
<i>So you're breaking up
with me because I'm too...blonde?</i>

1143
01:14:01,713 --> 01:14:03,915
<i>My boobs are too big?</i>

1144
01:14:05,184 --> 01:14:09,053
<i>So when you said</i>
<i>you would always love me,</i>

1145
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:10,688
<i>you were just dicking around?</i>

1146
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:56,134
See you, Mr. Cabot.

1147
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:16,053
Do you have a Paul Cabot
registered here?

1148
01:15:16,055 --> 01:15:17,522
Cabot? Yeah.

1149
01:15:17,524 --> 01:15:19,757
Someone was just pushed off
the seventh-floor balcony!

1150
01:15:19,759 --> 01:15:21,759
How do you know
he was pushed?

1151
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:24,195
A man was seen climbing
back into his room.

1152
01:15:24,197 --> 01:15:27,665
Calm down, relax.
Which side of the building was it on?

1153
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:30,301
That's the guy!
That's him! That's Cabot!

1154
01:15:56,128 --> 01:15:58,296
I'll take four.
You go upstairs.

1155
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,127
Stop!
Jesus!

1156
01:16:30,129 --> 01:16:33,598
Mathias?
I pulled in right after you.

1157
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,766
Did he come down?
Nobody came past me.

1158
01:16:35,768 --> 01:16:37,735
I'll meet you
in the lobby.

1159
01:16:37,737 --> 01:16:39,604
Okay.
In the lobby.

1160
01:16:51,617 --> 01:16:53,351
Get these people out of here.

1161
01:16:53,353 --> 01:16:55,119
I'm gonna shut down
the elevators.

1162
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:00,191
It's him. It's him!

1163
01:17:12,538 --> 01:17:15,005
Police officer.
Upstairs, upstairs!

1164
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,307
I'll cover the back!

1165
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:26,150
<i>The hell with that.</i>
<i>You got the money?</i>

1166
01:17:26,152 --> 01:17:27,485
Yeah, I got the money.

1167
01:17:27,487 --> 01:17:28,986
<i>Great. Where'd</i>
<i>you stash it?</i>

1168
01:17:28,988 --> 01:17:30,622
Right behind the seat.

1169
01:17:30,624 --> 01:17:32,923
<i>Flight number 601,</i>
<i>non-stop to San Jose.</i>

1170
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:36,361
I'm not flying to Costa Rica.
Get off the phone.

1171
01:17:36,363 --> 01:17:38,129
I gotta go.
<i>I'll swing by your house...</i>

1172
01:17:38,131 --> 01:17:39,731
<i>I'll pick up some underwear,</i>
<i>toothbrush...</i>

1173
01:17:43,302 --> 01:17:45,836
Your new girl?
No.

1174
01:17:47,005 --> 01:17:49,507
Weren't we supposed
to meet in the lobby?

1175
01:17:49,509 --> 01:17:54,612
I just had to get my cell
out of the car, make a call...

1176
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:58,883
...back to the office,
you know, checking on a lead.

1177
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:01,319
Let's go back upstairs.
My boys are on it.

1178
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,621
Okay.

1179
01:18:03,623 --> 01:18:06,424
Why don't we go have a talk?

1180
01:18:07,626 --> 01:18:10,194
Sure.
Okay.

1181
01:18:22,274 --> 01:18:26,243
You got something
you, uh...Want to tell me

1182
01:18:26,245 --> 01:18:30,448
or need to tell me?
What do you mean?

1183
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,717
I mean something
that I ought to know,

1184
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,220
but that you might not
want to say.

1185
01:18:39,124 --> 01:18:42,059
Congratulations
on making detective.

1186
01:18:42,061 --> 01:18:44,762
I'm proud of you.
I never said it, but I am.

1187
01:18:44,764 --> 01:18:48,733
I know you are.
You don't have to say it.

1188
01:18:48,735 --> 01:18:50,735
That's not what
I'm talking about.

1189
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:54,905
How'd you get
to the hotel so fast?

1190
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,908
I heard it on the radio.

1191
01:19:00,746 --> 01:19:03,214
So nothing else
you want to say?

1192
01:19:03,216 --> 01:19:06,484
I'm gonna sign
those divorce papers.

1193
01:19:06,486 --> 01:19:07,352
I'm not talking--

1194
01:19:07,354 --> 01:19:09,253
I'll get to it.
I just haven't...

1195
01:19:09,255 --> 01:19:12,857
When we leave here, I'll sign 'em.
Mathias, it's cool.

1196
01:19:12,859 --> 01:19:14,492
We're in no hurry.

1197
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:18,996
Are we?
I'm not.

1198
01:19:21,066 --> 01:19:24,034
You know what this place
reminds me of?

1199
01:19:24,036 --> 01:19:26,537
When we first started
going out.

1200
01:19:26,539 --> 01:19:30,040
Remember when we used to talk
on the phone for hours?

1201
01:19:30,042 --> 01:19:32,943
And you had this thing.

1202
01:19:32,945 --> 01:19:37,582
You'd say, "well,
I guess that's everything."

1203
01:19:37,584 --> 01:19:42,069
And you'd hang up on me.
And then you'd call right back.

1204
01:19:42,071 --> 01:19:45,790
That's right.
What would you say?

1205
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:48,092
That I love you...

1206
01:19:49,428 --> 01:19:50,828
Very much.

1207
01:19:55,401 --> 01:19:56,667
I liked that.

1208
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:17,522
Come here.

1209
01:20:17,524 --> 01:20:20,157
Come here, you have
something in your hair.

1210
01:21:22,387 --> 01:21:24,254
Chief. Chief.

1211
01:21:24,256 --> 01:21:27,692
These are from agent Stark.
He sounded kind of pissed.

1212
01:21:27,694 --> 01:21:29,327
See you tomorrow, okay?

1213
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:31,495
Detective,
the hotel called.

1214
01:21:31,497 --> 01:21:34,131
The clerk's on his way
from the hospital.

1215
01:21:34,133 --> 01:21:35,399
Detective?

1216
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:36,867
Call the insurance company,

1217
01:21:36,869 --> 01:21:39,437
see if they found out
who the beneficiary is yet.

1218
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:41,138
Okay, you got it.

1219
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:02,727
<i>City Hall.</i>
Hi. Accounting, please.

1220
01:22:02,729 --> 01:22:05,028
<i>Sure, let me get</i>
<i>that number for you.</i>

1221
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:08,198
<i>I'm sorry, they've</i>
<i>gone home for the day.</i>

1222
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,033
Of course they have.
Thank you.

1223
01:22:10,035 --> 01:22:11,736
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1224
01:22:11,738 --> 01:22:15,606
Alex, did Cabot make any
phone calls from his hotel?

1225
01:22:15,608 --> 01:22:17,274
We're waiting on them.

1226
01:22:17,276 --> 01:22:18,776
Okay.

1227
01:22:20,211 --> 01:22:24,081
Chief, the hotel called.
They left a message.

1228
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:28,586
The clerk left half an hour ago.
He should be here any minute.

1229
01:22:30,256 --> 01:22:31,689
Great.

1230
01:22:46,705 --> 01:22:47,805
Whitlock.

1231
01:22:51,743 --> 01:22:52,777
Hello?

1232
01:22:52,779 --> 01:22:55,145
<i>Matt...</i>

1233
01:22:55,147 --> 01:22:58,482
<i>Matt, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1234
01:22:58,484 --> 01:23:00,618
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1235
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,253
<i>It was never...</i>

1236
01:23:03,255 --> 01:23:04,988
This is a surprise.

1237
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:09,993
There's so much
I have to tell you.

1238
01:23:09,995 --> 01:23:12,763
I need to...

1239
01:23:12,765 --> 01:23:15,365
You got a lot of people
worried about you, Ann.

1240
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:16,567
<i>I know.</i>

1241
01:23:16,569 --> 01:23:20,337
We all had the funny idea
that you were dead.

1242
01:23:20,339 --> 01:23:23,173
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'm so sorry.

1243
01:23:23,175 --> 01:23:25,810
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
Where's Chris?

1244
01:23:25,812 --> 01:23:28,946
<i>Oh, God, I've lied</i>
<i>to you so much.</i>

1245
01:23:28,948 --> 01:23:30,648
He forced me to do this.

1246
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:35,018
<i>He and his friend Paul found
out about the Scarcetti thing.</i>

1247
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,054
<i>They stole bodies</i>
<i>from the morgue.</i>

1248
01:23:37,056 --> 01:23:39,189
You switched
the dental records.

1249
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:40,390
<i>I had to.</i>

1250
01:23:40,392 --> 01:23:42,626
<i>I had to.</i>
<i>They--</i>

1251
01:23:42,628 --> 01:23:45,228
<i>they said they'd kill me.</i>

1252
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,197
<i>See, Paul was</i>
<i>a criminal, Matt.</i>

1253
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,900
He was?
<i>Yes.</i>

1254
01:23:49,902 --> 01:23:52,670
<i>He was killed today.</i>

1255
01:23:52,672 --> 01:23:54,605
<i>They made me do this.</i>

1256
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:59,677
<i>Now it looks like</i>
<i>you and I faked my death</i>

1257
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:02,045
to collect on
the insurance policy.

1258
01:24:05,183 --> 01:24:07,518
So what do you want me to do?

1259
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,520
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to have to face them</i>

1260
01:24:09,522 --> 01:24:12,022
<i>and have to answer</i>
<i>questions about this.</i>

1261
01:24:12,024 --> 01:24:15,392
<i>I've gotta get out of town,</i>
<i>but I don't know where to go.</i>

1262
01:24:15,394 --> 01:24:17,595
<i>And I need money.</i>

1263
01:24:18,997 --> 01:24:20,764
So where's Chris?

1264
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:26,203
<i>You're right.
I should have come to you earlier.</i>

1265
01:24:26,205 --> 01:24:29,072
He's there, isn't he?
Yes.

1266
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:30,407
Uh-huh.

1267
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:34,578
<i>I would have contacted you</i>
<i>earlier,</i>

1268
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:37,147
<i>but I knew you would think</i>
<i>it was another trick.</i>

1269
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:40,017
<i>I don't blame you.</i>
<i>He beat me up and...</i>

1270
01:24:42,153 --> 01:24:44,454
Matt?
<i>Yeah.</i>

1271
01:24:46,157 --> 01:24:49,259
<i>He beat me up and...</i>

1272
01:24:49,261 --> 01:24:52,530
<i>See, Paul had the money--</i>
I have the money.

1273
01:24:52,532 --> 01:24:54,231
Oh, Matt.

1274
01:24:54,233 --> 01:24:58,468
No, I don't want to involve you
in any more of this.

1275
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,070
Where are you?

1276
01:25:00,072 --> 01:25:03,206
<i>I'm here at the old boat.</i>

1277
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:04,642
Stay there.
I'll meet you.

1278
01:25:13,652 --> 01:25:16,404
I've interviewed her
twice already,

1279
01:25:16,406 --> 01:25:17,855
and it does match up.

1280
01:25:41,412 --> 01:25:43,881
Neil, detective
Diaz-Whitlock.

1281
01:25:43,883 --> 01:25:44,882
Hi.

1282
01:25:44,884 --> 01:25:47,284
Ouch. How you feeling?
I'm okay.

1283
01:25:47,286 --> 01:25:49,620
You're up for answering
a few questions? Yeah?

1284
01:25:49,622 --> 01:25:51,989
You need anything else?
This way.

1285
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:00,731
All right, Neil,
take a seat to your left.

1286
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,467
Here you go.

1287
01:26:03,469 --> 01:26:06,770
Where's chief Whitlock?
I don't know. Bathroom, maybe.

1288
01:26:06,772 --> 01:26:09,873
Alex, insurance
company, line two.

1289
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,308
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.

1290
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,876
<i>Detective,</i>
<i>I got your beneficiary.</i>

1291
01:26:12,878 --> 01:26:15,012
<i>It's a Mathias Lee Whitlock.</i>

1292
01:26:16,347 --> 01:26:17,748
Thank you.

1293
01:26:21,452 --> 01:26:25,889
Matt. Matt.

1294
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:55,753
Agent Stark, DEA.
I'm looking for chief Whitlock.

1295
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,402
How much was it?
485,000.

1296
01:27:12,404 --> 01:27:14,905
Did he arrange to have it
picked up or dropped off?

1297
01:27:14,907 --> 01:27:17,307
He told my agents he was
sending it to my office.

1298
01:27:17,309 --> 01:27:18,575
Nobody showed.

1299
01:27:18,577 --> 01:27:21,111
I'm sure there was just
a miscommunication.

1300
01:30:50,889 --> 01:30:52,856
That's a .38, Chris.

1301
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,326
Only six shots.

1302
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:20,350
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

1303
01:31:48,546 --> 01:31:49,779
He's gone.

1304
01:31:55,987 --> 01:31:57,387
You all right?

1305
01:32:00,191 --> 01:32:01,925
Give me the gun.

1306
01:32:01,927 --> 01:32:03,526
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1307
01:32:03,528 --> 01:32:04,995
Ann...

1308
01:32:04,997 --> 01:32:08,432
You said he beat you up.
It was self-defense.

1309
01:32:08,434 --> 01:32:11,534
No jury would convict you.
Just put the gun down.

1310
01:32:11,536 --> 01:32:14,071
You think Chris
did this to my face?

1311
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:21,644
I think you should
put your gun on the floor.

1312
01:32:22,813 --> 01:32:26,083
What?
Put it down, Matt.

1313
01:32:26,085 --> 01:32:29,486
I didn't think I could
do this, but I will.

1314
01:32:34,025 --> 01:32:37,827
You set this up.
Put your gun on the floor.

1315
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:39,363
Are you sure?

1316
01:32:39,365 --> 01:32:41,164
Mm-hmm.

1317
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:48,305
Don't do this, Ann.

1318
01:32:50,241 --> 01:32:53,776
Where's the money?
Come on. Jesus!

1319
01:33:15,933 --> 01:33:17,367
So you...

1320
01:33:18,602 --> 01:33:22,105
We--we didn't mean anything
to each other?

1321
01:33:22,107 --> 01:33:24,341
It's not important.
So that's not important now.

1322
01:33:24,343 --> 01:33:27,377
It was just all an act?
Where's the money?

1323
01:33:27,379 --> 01:33:30,980
Look me in the eye and tell me
you didn't mean any of it.

1324
01:33:30,982 --> 01:33:33,650
Some of it!
Don't try to confuse me!

1325
01:33:33,652 --> 01:33:36,953
I don't have any choice now.
You don't have to do this.

1326
01:33:36,955 --> 01:33:40,857
I've known you all your life.
I know you're not a criminal.

1327
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:41,858
Matt, stop!

1328
01:33:51,936 --> 01:33:53,303
What?!

1329
01:33:54,472 --> 01:33:57,907
Okay. All right,
high-school sweetheart.

1330
01:33:57,909 --> 01:34:00,643
You think I'm playing?
I'm not playing, Matt.

1331
01:34:01,879 --> 01:34:03,280
Damn!

1332
01:34:03,282 --> 01:34:06,616
I was aiming for your arm.
Well, you missed!

1333
01:34:06,618 --> 01:34:08,418
Where is it?
Outside the door.

1334
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:11,088
Show me!
All right, all right.

1335
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:14,257
Just calm down. Just calm down, Ann.
Just wait.

1336
01:34:14,259 --> 01:34:15,959
Just wait.

1337
01:34:15,961 --> 01:34:18,795
Don't shoot me, okay?
I'm just gonna reach for it.

1338
01:34:18,797 --> 01:34:20,063
Show me!

1339
01:34:21,599 --> 01:34:23,600
Here it is.
Put it down.

1340
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,637
Wait, don't shoot me.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1341
01:34:27,639 --> 01:34:29,939
I'm--I'm-- I'm the one
that got you the money.

1342
01:34:29,941 --> 01:34:31,374
I'm trying to
save your life.

1343
01:34:36,481 --> 01:34:39,048
It wasn't all an act, baby.
It wasn't.

1344
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:42,785
I can't live broke.
Life ain't shit when you're broke.

1345
01:34:42,787 --> 01:34:44,787
Shit!
Wait, wait, Ann!

1346
01:34:44,789 --> 01:34:47,557
Ann, wait, no!

1347
01:34:47,559 --> 01:34:49,493
Ann!

1348
01:34:58,202 --> 01:34:59,202
Oh, my God.

1349
01:35:02,706 --> 01:35:05,975
Anyone else up here?
No.

1350
01:35:05,977 --> 01:35:07,310
Oh...

1351
01:35:17,221 --> 01:35:18,655
How'd you find me?

1352
01:35:27,665 --> 01:35:30,534
Are you hit?
No, I'm okay.

1353
01:35:30,536 --> 01:35:31,969
I'm all right.

1354
01:35:38,175 --> 01:35:41,812
It's Alex. Get me an ambulance
and a med examiner.

1355
01:35:41,814 --> 01:35:43,246
No, I'm fine.

1356
01:35:43,248 --> 01:35:46,249
I'm at the end
of Runyon Road on the dock.

1357
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:47,584
Hurry.

1358
01:35:51,255 --> 01:35:52,689
Did you kill Paul Cabot?

1359
01:35:54,926 --> 01:35:56,226
No...

1360
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:59,329
It was self-defense.
He was attacking me.

1361
01:35:59,331 --> 01:36:01,231
I was trying
to get the money back.

1362
01:36:01,233 --> 01:36:04,100
You were just gonna
hand the money back?

1363
01:36:05,202 --> 01:36:10,106
That's what I was trying to do, Alex.
Then what's that over there, Matt?

1364
01:36:55,987 --> 01:36:57,253
What do you got?

1365
01:36:57,255 --> 01:36:59,890
Chris and Ann Harrison's
bodies are upstairs.

1366
01:36:59,892 --> 01:37:01,291
The real ones.

1367
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:04,327
They were both
working for Cabot.

1368
01:37:04,329 --> 01:37:06,162
Chief found out they were here

1369
01:37:06,164 --> 01:37:07,998
and took care of business,
right?

1370
01:37:09,634 --> 01:37:10,834
Right.

1371
01:37:10,836 --> 01:37:13,369
Let's move.
Good job.

1372
01:37:13,371 --> 01:37:14,771
Thank you.

1373
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:21,011
Thank you very much.

1374
01:37:23,081 --> 01:37:26,349
Your guy never
showed up, Whitlock.

1375
01:37:26,351 --> 01:37:28,384
Agent Stark?

1376
01:37:28,386 --> 01:37:30,687
Yeah.

1377
01:37:30,689 --> 01:37:32,823
You know, I don't care
if you're injured or not,

1378
01:37:32,825 --> 01:37:34,825
I want that evidence money,

1379
01:37:34,827 --> 01:37:37,327
or you're gonna be looking
at a case of your own--

1380
01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:40,864
where the hell is Southeast
63rd street in Miami?

1381
01:37:40,866 --> 01:37:42,766
53rd street, Chae.
No.

1382
01:37:42,768 --> 01:37:44,735
I told you 53rd street,
not 63rd.

1383
01:37:44,737 --> 01:37:46,336
No, you did not.
Yes, I did.

1384
01:37:46,338 --> 01:37:48,138
I said Southeast 53rd--

1385
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:50,107
you said,
"those assholes in the DEA

1386
01:37:50,109 --> 01:37:52,976
are at 8400
Southeast 63rd street."

1387
01:37:52,978 --> 01:37:54,711
I didn't.
I'm sorry, agent Stark.

1388
01:37:54,713 --> 01:37:57,213
What I said was,
"those assholes from the DEA

1389
01:37:57,215 --> 01:38:01,151
are at 8400
southeast 53rd," Chae.

1390
01:38:01,153 --> 01:38:03,319
63rd.
Never mind.

1391
01:38:03,321 --> 01:38:05,656
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.

1392
01:38:07,324 --> 01:38:09,926
You don't have to count it.
It's all there.

1393
01:38:09,928 --> 01:38:11,561
Have a safe ride home.

1394
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:16,499
Come on.
Assholes.

1395
01:38:18,736 --> 01:38:21,872
It is all there, right?
Most of it.

1396
01:38:21,874 --> 01:38:25,375
It's all there. Jesus.

1397
01:38:25,377 --> 01:38:28,178
That's a pretty good one.
Nice touch.

1398
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:29,579
A little over the top.

1399
01:38:29,581 --> 01:38:30,947
Which part?
Your part.

1400
01:38:30,949 --> 01:38:33,616
My part? You're the one
that came in here screaming.

1401
01:38:33,618 --> 01:38:35,085
What happened to you, man?

1402
01:38:35,087 --> 01:38:38,055
Just never leave your wife.
That's what happened to me.

1403
01:38:39,456 --> 01:38:40,991
I'd take the bullet.

1404
01:38:41,826 --> 01:38:44,627
Be careful there.
It's a classic, okay?

1405
01:38:44,629 --> 01:38:46,930
That grille work
comes from France.

1406
01:38:48,066 --> 01:38:50,567
How you feeling?
Excuse us.

1407
01:38:50,569 --> 01:38:53,837
Yes, ma'am.
Did you love her?

1408
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,007
No.

1409
01:38:58,743 --> 01:39:00,977
Why would you do this, then?

1410
01:39:02,747 --> 01:39:04,681
Because I'm...

1411
01:39:06,117 --> 01:39:09,019
Because I'm stupid.
Because...

1412
01:39:09,021 --> 01:39:10,921
I thought I was doing
the right thing,

1413
01:39:10,923 --> 01:39:13,924
trying to help her,
but it's no excuse.

1414
01:39:13,926 --> 01:39:18,428
Alex, sometimes people,
you know,

1415
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:19,863
do stupid things.

1416
01:39:22,066 --> 01:39:25,035
Especially when
they're still in love.

1417
01:39:35,146 --> 01:39:36,913
Thank you.

1418
01:39:36,915 --> 01:39:38,115
Let's go.

1419
01:40:24,562 --> 01:40:25,662
Chae?

1420
01:40:28,816 --> 01:40:29,800
Hello.

1421
01:40:31,368 --> 01:40:32,335
Hi.

1422
01:40:34,172 --> 01:40:36,239
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.

1423
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:39,409
He called all worked up
about something.

1424
01:40:39,411 --> 01:40:40,977
Okay.

1425
01:40:40,979 --> 01:40:42,679
You, uh,
you want to sit down?

1426
01:40:42,681 --> 01:40:44,047
Yeah.

1427
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:56,226
How you doing?
Good.

1428
01:40:56,228 --> 01:40:58,661
I ask that already?
Yes. I said I was good.

1429
01:40:58,663 --> 01:41:00,596
You want a beer?
Yes.

1430
01:41:02,716 --> 01:41:04,567
I don't have any left.

1431
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:06,369
You can share mine, though.

1432
01:41:08,605 --> 01:41:11,007
So what brings you
out this way?

1433
01:41:11,009 --> 01:41:13,977
I just needed to move
the rest of my stuff.

1434
01:41:13,979 --> 01:41:15,678
Okay.

1435
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,914
That's cool, I guess.

1436
01:41:19,516 --> 01:41:21,051
The house is a mess.

1437
01:41:21,053 --> 01:41:22,285
Say, Matt!

1438
01:41:22,287 --> 01:41:25,171
This came for you
at the station.

1439
01:41:25,173 --> 01:41:26,622
Hi, Chae.

1440
01:41:26,624 --> 01:41:29,326
You opened it? You opened my mail?
Yeah.

1441
01:41:29,328 --> 01:41:32,462
Why you always opening my mail?
Read it.

1442
01:41:32,464 --> 01:41:34,497
They just want you
to fill out the forms.

1443
01:41:34,499 --> 01:41:36,432
"To claim amount payable
to the beneficiary

1444
01:41:36,434 --> 01:41:38,468
for the sum of $1 million."

1445
01:41:39,636 --> 01:41:41,771
What?
We're rich.

1446
01:41:41,773 --> 01:41:43,406
The enclosed forms...

1447
01:41:43,408 --> 01:41:45,775
We're rich.
How about that?

1448
01:41:45,777 --> 01:41:48,144
$1 million.
Easy, Chae. Easy.

1449
01:41:48,146 --> 01:41:51,882
He can't take that money.
I can't take the money?

1450
01:41:51,884 --> 01:41:55,018
Why not?
It's a conflict of interest.

1451
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,488
He's the legal beneficiary.
I am the legal beneficiary.

1452
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:00,874
And he's one of
the arresting officers.

1453
01:42:00,876 --> 01:42:03,459
What the hell's that got to do
with anything? So what?

1454
01:42:03,461 --> 01:42:06,629
Tell him how much trouble
you can get in.

1455
01:42:06,631 --> 01:42:08,164
Matt, it's a million bucks!

1456
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:10,700
It's the chance
of a lifetime! No!

1457
01:42:10,702 --> 01:42:12,102
No, Chae.

1458
01:42:12,104 --> 01:42:16,306
As his wife, I'm telling you
he's not taking that money.

1459
01:42:16,308 --> 01:42:18,808
As my wife?
As your wife.

1460
01:42:19,877 --> 01:42:22,012
Matt, come on.

1461
01:42:22,014 --> 01:42:24,180
Come on, don't fall for that.

1462
01:42:24,182 --> 01:42:27,317
What do you mean as my wife?
As your wife.

1463
01:42:27,319 --> 01:42:30,387
You said you came
to move your stuff.

1464
01:42:30,389 --> 01:42:32,688
I'm moving back in.

1465
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:35,708
This is great. Congratulations.
It's kind of fortuitous.

1466
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:37,627
You serious?
Yeah.

1467
01:42:37,629 --> 01:42:39,562
Are you gonna behave?

1468
01:42:39,564 --> 01:42:42,165
I'm actually afraid
to leave you by yourself.

1469
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:44,534
You won the sweepstakes, man.

1470
01:42:45,803 --> 01:42:48,438
Matt, you can do this later.
It's a million bucks.

1471
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,307
Let's not lose focus.

1472
01:42:50,309 --> 01:42:55,245
You know, a honeymoon fund,
a nursery wing for the...

1473
01:42:55,247 --> 01:42:57,380
Matt, this is the--the--
the golden pot

1474
01:42:57,382 --> 01:42:59,615
at the end of
the storm thing!

1475
01:42:59,617 --> 01:43:01,318
Matt?

1476
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,486
Just sign it
before you go in, huh?

1477
01:43:05,456 --> 01:43:07,523
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.

1478
01:43:07,525 --> 01:43:09,826
I'm gonna be sitting out here
when you're finished.

1479
01:43:09,828 --> 01:43:12,929
I can wait three minutes.
I'm a patient man.

1480
01:43:12,931 --> 01:43:16,433
I am a patient man.
Come on, Matt!
