1
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:41,997
<i>Well, all right. Look at all that</i>
<i>beautiful, white stuff come down.</i>

2
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,293
<i>Christmas is right around the corner...</i>

3
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,634
<i>... And Hanukkah starts tonight.</i>

4
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,305
<i>Ain't a better time of year.</i>

5
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:53,141
<i>You got no school, you can eat</i>
<i>like a pig and people give you stuff.</i>

6
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,058
<i>Just makes you feel tingly all over.</i>

7
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,138
<i>But you know what?</i>

8
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:02,191
<i>There are some buffoons out there who</i>
<i>actually can't stand the holiday season.</i>

9
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:04,771
<i>And seeing other people</i>
<i>enjoy the festivities...</i>

10
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,526
<i>... Gets them even more disgusted.</i>

11
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,069
<i>In fact, the head honcho of holiday</i>
<i>humbug...</i>

12
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:13,947
<i>... Lives right here in little old dukesberry.</i>
<i>His name's Davey Stone.</i>

13
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,456
<i>That fool's in the China dragon...</i>

14
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:20,163
<i>... Coming up with his own way</i>
<i>of feeling tingly all over.</i>

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,381
Four scorpion bowl in five minute?
That's got to be a restaurant record.

16
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:31,633
Well, right now I'm going to go for
another restaurant record: Longest burp.

17
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:47,572
Congratulations. Now, please excuse me
while I go take shower.

18
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:51,411
<i>At one time, Davey was a super student,</i>
<i>super athlete...</i>

19
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:55,413
<i>... Super sweet, super kid and the apple</i>
<i>of his parents' eye.</i>

20
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:01,413
<i>Now, he's just a 33-year-old,</i>
<i>crazy Jewish guy...</i>

21
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:05,085
<i>... Who lives for making this town</i>
<i>as miserable as he is...</i>

22
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,676
<i>... Especially on the first night</i>
<i>of Hanukkah.</i>

23
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,677
<i>How'd he end up this way?</i>
<i>Let's save that for later...</i>

24
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:15,644
<i>... Because right now, Davey's about to</i>
<i>get himself into some serious trouble.</i>

25
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:22,898
Hope you're not planning on driving
tonight, Stone.

26
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:26,863
No, officer. I'm just going to say
good night to my car...

27
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:30,902
Then walk home and enjoy
the holiday decorations.

28
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:35,032
Listen, sweetheart. I have to leave you
here alone tonight...

29
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,078
But don't you worry, I'll be back
first thing in the morning.

30
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:43,248
Now, behave yourself,
and don't stay up too late.

31
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,879
Nighty-night.

32
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:50,893
All right, baby. But let's make this quick.

33
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:52,889
Oh, mama!

34
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:55,310
You like it when I hold you like this?

35
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,560
Because I'll do it all night long.

36
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:02,144
So sweet.

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,778
Yes, so precious.

38
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:09,741
I love you, car.

39
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:14,457
He dine and dash me! He chew and
screw me! He sip and skip me!

40
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:17,586
- What?
- He no pay for his four scorpion bowl.

41
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,035
Oh, boy.

42
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:22,087
Get him.

43
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:29,092
Come back here, you jerk!

44
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,431
Somebody stop that guy!

45
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,813
<i>I'm the kind of guy who can't stand</i>
<i>a holiday</i>

46
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:40,975
<i>so I drink them all away, that's me</i>

47
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:44,482
<i>i don't decorate no trees</i>

48
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,151
<i>and I won't eat no potato latkes</i>

49
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,949
<i>but I'll give this old lady's melons</i>
<i>a squeeze</i>

50
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,830
<i>that's just who I am</i>

51
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:05,010
<i>well, I'll never spin a dreidel,</i>
<i>but I'll always throw an egg</i>

52
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:09,302
<i>and I'll Charley horse your leg for laughs</i>

53
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:13,019
<i>while you're singing your holiday tunes</i>

54
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,813
<i>I'm acting like the town buffoon</i>

55
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:20,851
<i>whipping out my big, white, scary moon</i>

56
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:24,487
<i>and blowing a beef your way</i>

57
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:28,158
<i>i hate folks who think reindeer are cute</i>

58
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:31,407
<i>to me they're just something to shoot</i>

59
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,707
<i>i hate love</i>

60
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:35,662
<i>i hate you</i>

61
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:37,752
<i>i hate me</i>

62
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:41,548
<i>well, I'm a snowmobile-stealing</i>

63
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,588
<i>no 'tis-the-season-feeling kind of guy</i>

64
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:51,051
<i>this time of year sucks</i>
<i>so I take my nunchaks</i>

65
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,220
<i>and make sure every snowman dies</i>

66
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:58,726
<i>believing in Santa's all wrong</i>

67
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:02,686
<i>and Hanukkah's eight nights too long</i>

68
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,195
<i>i hate love</i>

69
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,944
<i>i hate you</i>

70
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:08,029
<i>i hate me</i>

71
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,360
coming through.

72
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:10,695
<i>I hate love</i>

73
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,534
<i>i hate you</i>

74
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:13,871
<i>i hate me</i>

75
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:16,873
Davey Stone, you're nothing
but a delinquent!

76
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:20,966
Stone, what the heck are we
going to do with you?

77
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:25,719
I've sent you to reform school, the drunk
tank, the local psychiatric ward.

78
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,424
Not one of those places has made you
change an ounce for the better.

79
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,268
You used to be a good kid...

80
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:36,390
Playing ball for the Jewish community
centre, with the best jump shot ever seen.

81
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:40,393
Your honor, I still got a pretty good
jump shot. Let me show you.

82
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:46,284
I'd hit a 3-pointer, but I'd
have to drop my pants...

83
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:48,570
And pop a thumb up my boo-boo.

84
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:53,285
You leave me no choice. I'll really
have to crack down hard this time.

85
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:58,627
Your honor, if it pleases the court,
I'd like to interject for a moment.

86
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:03,004
What the hell was that? Did anybody else
hear a parakeet, or am I going crazy?

87
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,672
No, Mr. Chang. It's me, Whitey Duval.

88
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,845
And a happy first night of Hanukkah
to you.

89
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,603
I'm not Jewish.

90
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:16,225
Neither am I, but that don't stop me
from enjoying a holiday.

91
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:19,771
Whitey, we went over this
two months ago.

92
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:23,273
It's your last year of reffing
the youth league basketball.

93
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,986
You're turning 70 years old...

94
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:28,653
And our insurance company says
they won't cover you anymore.

95
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,862
No, no, no.

96
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:34,874
My interjection pertains to the case
currently under adjudication.

97
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:37,625
You see, I knew this young man
years ago...

98
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,633
When his moral fiber was still intact.

99
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:42,337
What are you getting at?

100
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:47,050
Why not sentence him to be a
referee-in-training for youth basketball?

101
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:51,009
I've seen some pretty rowdy kids
turn into perfect gentlemen...

102
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,637
After spending time on my court.

103
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:56,395
If that happened with Stone,
it would be a miracle.

104
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,236
It's the holidays. Things like that have
been known to happen this time of year.

105
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,151
Whitey, if you want to work with
this punk, then God bless you.

106
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,324
But Mr. Stone, what Whitey says goes.

107
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,414
And if I hear that you break one law...

108
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:16,127
I'll send you to the state
penitentiary for no less than 10 years.

109
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,173
Happy holidays.

110
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:22,167
Oh, God.

111
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:25,008
<i>The short man who's kind</i>
<i>and the donkey's behind.</i>

112
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:29,262
<i>What a bizarre match up.</i>
<i>Good luck, Whitey. You'll need it.</i>

113
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,514
Okay, let's give the little guy
some support.

114
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:39,728
Did I just see two persian cats
on your ass?

115
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:44,276
I think I'm going to barf.

116
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:48,323
Your horn works, try the lights.

117
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,535
Okay.

118
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:55,960
One. Two.

119
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:58,295
Good to see you still got circus feet.

120
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:02,636
Men's 11 right foot, children's
9 left foot...

121
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:04,221
At your service.

122
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:05,754
Yuck.

123
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:09,724
Now, I assume you've done
your pre-game stretching.

124
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,597
No, let me do it right now.

125
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:14,139
One. Two. Three.

126
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:16,397
Four. Five. Six.

127
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:19,486
Okay. That's good, but don't forget
your hammies.

128
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:22,905
<i>Of course Whitey wouldn't understand</i>
<i>what getting flipped off means.</i>

129
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:26,076
<i>He's so behind the times,</i>
<i>he thinks Viagra's a big waterfall.</i>

130
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,081
<i>But there is one thing he knows.</i>

131
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:32,700
<i>The voting has begun for the highest</i>
<i>honor anyone in town could receive.</i>

132
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,715
I think it's gonna be your year, Whitey.
I really do.

133
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:44,134
Whoa. Don't even think of coming
on this floor with those hard soles, pally.

134
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,305
Fine, I'll just ref in my socks.

135
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,263
Must be game time.

136
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:56,608
Don't let him push your buttons, whitey.

137
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,130
What are you waiting for?

138
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:23,296
- Come on. Dribble!
- Hurry up!

139
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,098
What, no whistle on that one, ref?

140
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:32,559
Okay.

141
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:37,148
Foul on this kid for eating
everything in sight.

142
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:41,816
Jelly jugs, next time you come on
my court, you better wear a bra. Okay?

143
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:47,830
He was just kidding, son.
You've got very nice boobs.

144
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,571
- Jerk!
- Idiot!

145
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,659
You don't like that? How about you
throw something at me. I dare you.

146
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:55,711
With pleasure!

147
00:09:56,173 --> 00:10:00,835
They're scratching up my floor.
Here comes a seizure.

148
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:05,715
This will pass in a second, kids.

149
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,392
Don't be scared.

150
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:09,096
Is he break dancing?

151
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:15,021
Okay, that's it. Game over.
Nobody wants to see an old man die.

152
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:18,355
Fatty's team loses because
I want to see him cry again.

153
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,948
I want to talk to you in my office.

154
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,782
Why the hell are we at the mall?

155
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,075
You need to clean your brain out.

156
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,627
And to me, the mall is the best place
to do that.

157
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,381
What's good about this place?

158
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,540
What's good about it? Everything.
You want a pair of socks?

159
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,923
My buddy, Mr. foot locker,
will warm your feet.

160
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,800
You need a fancy doodad?

161
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:51,260
Hello, sharper lmage. Thanks for the
combination pogo stick<i>l</i>clock radio.

162
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:54,055
I mean, the body shop, the tie rack...

163
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:56,061
Gnc, radioshack...

164
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,739
Petland for a cat or two,
Spencer's gifts for some fake dog doo...

165
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:03,654
Sbarro's, dunkin' donuts,
they're simply the best.

166
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,823
And don't forget the orange
chicken at panda express.

167
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,447
But if you're short of cash
like little old me...

168
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,419
The window shopping's always free.

169
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:17,500
Did you prepare that or did you rhyme
that many times in a row by accident?

170
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,382
Yeah, that was weird, wasn't it?

171
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,089
Maybe you are a leprechaun.

172
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:25,015
Let's just get some snacks and chat.
Okay?

173
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,726
Aren't you a boy?

174
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,432
Now, I'd like to make this work out.

175
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:37,771
But in order to do so, you're
going to have to learn...

176
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:42,656
That youth basketball ain't about you
and your lack of respect for others.

177
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:48,111
It's about the kids and teaching them
responsibility and teamwork.

178
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,458
I've been doing my part for 35 years.

179
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,623
Are you ready to join me, big guy?

180
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,889
Joke's on you, tough guy. I can't read.

181
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,801
Special delivery for Whitey duvall,
sugar-free doughnuts.

182
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,722
Every day she does this for me.
Jennifer, you're too much.

183
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,812
My fraternal twin sister's a diabetic...

184
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:20,607
And out of respect for her and her
disease, I don't eat sugar products.

185
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:23,494
There's a surprise in there you'll like.

186
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:27,410
Don't tell me it's bavarian cream-filled.

187
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,372
It is bavarian cream-filled!

188
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:31,866
Hubba-bubba!

189
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:37,426
These babies make my taste buds
do double daffies, for gosh sakes.

190
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,717
Why are you hiding over there?

191
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,004
It's okay, sweetheart. Talk to Whitey.

192
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:45,051
Hi, Whitey. I got another chanukah
present tonight.

193
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:49,182
Wow, Benjamin, an etch a sketch.
Not too shabby.

194
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:51,105
That's a game boy, you idiot.

195
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,184
Sorry, I'm not up
on modern technology.

196
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:58,863
But I guess my friend Davey is.
Why don't you tell him what else you got.

197
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,523
First night, I got a basketball
and some dreidels.

198
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:04,530
Night two, I got a pup tent for camping
in the backyard.

199
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:06,454
And tonight, I got this.

200
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:11,576
Wow. Maybe on night four the Hanukkah
monster will take a big crap on your bed.

201
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,205
Thanks for sharing the holiday spirit,
psycho.

202
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:17,962
Come and help me clean the muffin trays.

203
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:21,012
- Bye, Whitey.
- See you at the game tomorrow.

204
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:26,215
Your girlfriend's backyard
isn't sugar-free. That baby looks sweet.

205
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,057
Technical foul! Technical foul!

206
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,480
That's a lady, and you will not
speak about her that way!

207
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,723
Easy.

208
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:36,393
She's going through a tough time now.

209
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:40,397
Last spring, her husband of 13 years
ups and leaves her...

210
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:43,245
For a woman he met on the computer.

211
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:48,751
She had the courage to move back a
month ago to try and raise her boy alone.

212
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,495
So she's available?

213
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:54,495
You wish, Mac. You blew your shot
with her 20 years ago.

214
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:55,996
Twenty years?

215
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:58,008
Was that Jennifer Friedman?

216
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:01,879
I'm surprised you have enough brain cells
left to remember.

217
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:08,270
Hey, Jennifer, you still coming over to
watch <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i> after the game?

218
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:09,813
That's a big 10-4, Davey.

219
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,012
Hey, Davey.

220
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:13,605
Smile! Your mom wants to take a picture.

221
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:15,851
Thanks, honey.

222
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:18,864
If my parents fall asleep early,
I'll show you my basement.

223
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,575
Keep dreaming.

224
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,410
They make a nice couple
boogie-oogie-oogies.

225
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,124
I don't know when you were goofier,
then or now.

226
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,664
Good evening, mayor stuey duhy.
Out for some late-night shopping?

227
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:37,962
Yeah. Then I have to figure out how to
rebuild our giant menorah and Santa.

228
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:40,543
Thanks for ruining the ice pageant again,
Stone.

229
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:43,255
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for the ladies.

230
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,464
Yeah, right.

231
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:50,804
Has there been talk about who the lucky
patch recipient may be this year or?

232
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:54,731
That's up to who the town votes for.
Could be you or me or anybody.

233
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:57,359
All right, I'm going to get going now.

234
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:59,731
Happy holidays, your excellence.

235
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,485
Good night, mayor! And the answer
to your question is Spencer's gifts.

236
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:07,204
They definitely have furry underwear.

237
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,326
You're gross.

238
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:15,087
Is it just me, or did you notice
when he said, "it could be you"...

239
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:18,212
There was a certain sincerity
in his voice, or?

240
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:21,050
You actually give a crap
about winning a patch?

241
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:26,092
It's only the most prestigious award
given out at the all-star banquet.

242
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:28,221
Can you imagine?

243
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:32,187
<i>Won't you dance with me</i>

244
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:36,060
<i>at the annual all-star banquet?</i>

245
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:40,696
<i>We'll be so fancy-free</i>

246
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:44,997
<i>at the annual all-star banquet</i>

247
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,585
<i>everyone in town will be looking</i>
<i>their best</i>

248
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:53,377
<i>even Mrs. selman with her one</i>
<i>extra breast</i>

249
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,540
<i>it's the kind of a night when your</i>
<i>feet match</i>

250
00:15:57,719 --> 00:16:02,381
<i>when you feel nearly 5-foot-3!</i>

251
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:06,642
<i>They'll laugh and they'll dance</i>
<i>and they'll pee in their pants</i>

252
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:11,931
<i>'cause there's a patch at the</i>
<i>all-star banquet waiting for me</i>

253
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,894
can you take me home now?

254
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:21,901
<i>Well, that was nice of Davey to snap</i>
<i>Whitey out of his little dream.</i>

255
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,904
<i>All that song was saying</i>
<i>was the patch means the world to Whitey.</i>

256
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:28,490
<i>He'd rather be remembered</i>
<i>for his hard work...</i>

257
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,044
<i>... Not for the fact that he had the</i>
<i>hairiest buns in the locker room.</i>

258
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:33,589
<i>Can you blame him?</i>

259
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,050
How's that peanut brittle?

260
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,933
Crunchy and delicious.

261
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:49,679
Funny, I don't remember Denise
or Janice ringing up a purchase for you.

262
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,271
I guess that means I stole it.

263
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:58,779
Easy, seizure-boy!

264
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:01,698
That's it. I'm calling the judge.

265
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:05,951
Go ahead. I'll be on the first bus out.
I ain't spending 10 years in prison.

266
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,998
Maybe I'll just take you in myself.

267
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,626
Don't think you can intimidate me
just because of my size.

268
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,131
Why? You're smaller than me?
I didn't notice that.

269
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,960
Put me down! Put me down!

270
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,302
And get out of my car right now!

271
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:25,592
Oh, no. You're going to make me walk
10 feet? Because that's where I live, idiot!

272
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,564
Thanks for the ride, patchy.

273
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,015
It was great patching with you.

274
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:33,725
And I guess I'll patch you later.

275
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,566
I'm letting this one go, Stone.

276
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:42,610
But next screw-up, it's slammer time.

277
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:57,045
Got any sand or rock salt in there?

278
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,088
I need to get some traction.

279
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:03,427
"Got any sand or rock salt in there?
'Cause I need to get some..."

280
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,843
Oh, shut up!

281
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:10,439
He could've at least given me a push
or something.

282
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:32,501
<i>- Closing, channel 36 would</i>
<i>like to wish all of its Jewish viewers...</i>

283
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:35,123
<i>... The very happiest of Hanukkahs.</i>

284
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:37,252
Boo!

285
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:00,608
Hey!

286
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:03,575
A little help, fellas?

287
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:16,507
One. Two. Three!

288
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,628
Have a holly, jolly one, guys.

289
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,467
<i>Doesn't it make you feel good...</i>

290
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:24,975
<i>... When you see a group of deer</i>
<i>helping a motorist in need?</i>

291
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:27,471
<i>But I bet Whitey wishes they showed up</i>
<i>earlier...</i>

292
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,893
<i>... Because his sister, Eleanor,</i>
<i>gets a little edgy when he's late.</i>

293
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,895
Whitey, where were you?

294
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,779
You're an hour and 51 minutes late.
I already called the morgue.

295
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:41,326
They said you weren't there,
but to try back later.

296
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:44,616
I had an interesting talk
with the mayor tonight.

297
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:50,172
The mayor? Was it about the ruffians
who stole my Liz Taylor wig?

298
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:53,087
Eleanor, that was 45 years ago.

299
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,625
I'm still shaking from it.

300
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,131
Anyways, the mayor seems to think
there's a chance...

301
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,590
I might receive the patch this year.

302
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,593
Oh, boy. Let's just soak our feet, brother.

303
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:09,142
First position. Second position.

304
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,819
See you later, smell.

305
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,316
Just don't get your hopes up too high
about the patch.

306
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:20,867
I can handle myself, Eleanor. Trust me.

307
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:46,845
<i>When you have enough lights to make</i>
<i>your house look like the Vegas strip...</i>

308
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,431
<i>... You'll have a big electric bill.</i>

309
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:51,978
<i>And being a volunteer referee</i>
<i>for the youth basketball league...</i>

310
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:55,653
<i>... Doesn't exactly get you</i>
<i>in the</i> fortune <i>500.</i>

311
00:20:56,158 --> 00:21:00,571
<i>So old Whitey's up bright and early every</i>
<i>day, searching the town for odd jobs...</i>

312
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:03,581
<i>... To help make ends meet</i>
<i>for him and eleanore.</i>

313
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,042
How's that, fellas?!

314
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:08,707
It's crooked, shorty. Move it to the right.

315
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:09,911
You got it.

316
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,002
Whoops.

317
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:24,186
Well, will you look at that.
It's a jackass-in-the-box.

318
00:21:26,189 --> 00:21:28,265
Let's go get some coffee.

319
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:31,568
Anything else I can do for you guys?

320
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:34,898
If you clean out the crappers,
I'll give you a buck.

321
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,399
Consider it done.
Nice doing business with you.

322
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:00,463
That's what happens
when you hit the bottle.

323
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:04,634
You go to sleep in dukesberry,
you wake up in pukesberry.

324
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,225
Pukesberry.

325
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:08,474
Hey. What are you do..? No!

326
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:26,247
The worst has happened.
I'm covered in human faeces.

327
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:31,587
That's a good look for you. But for
health reasons, I should spray you off.

328
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,632
Smell you later, poopsicle.

329
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:46,344
You're a f ricking degenerate.

330
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,190
I know I am.

331
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,449
A little help, please.

332
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:16,045
Your tongues tickle.

333
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,965
They tickle.

334
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:21,680
<i>You are right. That was gross.</i>

335
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:25,640
Thumbelina, there's no kids playing.
Why'd you tell me to come?

336
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:30,441
I thought you could use a refresher
course on b-ball rules and regulations.

337
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:34,817
- You're nuts. I'm going to go pound a few.
- First of all, you booze, you lose.

338
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,524
And secondly, if you don't turn around...

339
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:43,083
Officer sherman over there'll know of
the infamous peanut brittle incident.

340
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:45,792
What's with the dunkin' munchkin?

341
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:50,499
His mom had to do a double shift so I'm
watching him till she can get here.

342
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:54,630
Now, both of you cop a squat next to me
and let's observe.

343
00:23:57,682 --> 00:23:59,140
Take it! Take it!

344
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:01,810
Charging! Our ball.

345
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:05,181
See, that wasn't a charge.
It was actually blocking.

346
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:08,981
The defender didn't have both feet
planted in time.

347
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:12,236
Oh, really? Because I thought
that was high-sticking.

348
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:17,901
Don't encourage him, Benjamin. He's
just upset because he can't play no more.

349
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:22,574
Twenty years of drinking destroyed
the basketball lobe of his brain.

350
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,249
I can whup any of those clowns
out there even with you as my partner.

351
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:28,004
I'd like to see that.

352
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:29,880
I'd like to see that right now.

353
00:24:30,091 --> 00:24:33,341
He was just kidding, fellas.
Whole lot of jibber jabber.

354
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:36,180
We got no beef with you guys.

355
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:41,016
Because if a midget and a drunk
can beat us, I'd eat my own jockstrap.

356
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:43,511
No, he don't play ball anymore.

357
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:47,556
I'll play. But if we win, you got to eat
that guy's jockstrap.

358
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:53,902
First to five wins. We're shirts.

359
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:58,115
Oh, boy. Does that mean we're skins?

360
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:02,907
I don't see any skin, monkey-man.

361
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,038
Just pass me the ball.

362
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:06,913
All right, fuzzy wuzzy.

363
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:11,377
All right, simmer down, Whitey.
Don't travel. Don't double dribble.

364
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,172
I want a good, clean game
and no back talk.

365
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,712
Orangutan, you're playing, not reffing.

366
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,054
He's right. Look for your opening
and take it.

367
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,552
There it is!

368
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,726
Now set yourself and shoot.

369
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,818
Oh, no.

370
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,818
Are you finally dead, old man?

371
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,449
I'll be over to feed the cats
in the morning...

372
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,041
Mrs. Addison.

373
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,290
Okay, he's useless.

374
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,590
One more thing.

375
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,310
Good kitty. Nice kitty.

376
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,929
Muffin boy, what's your real name?

377
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,136
Benjamin.

378
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,981
You're in. Let's go.

379
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:08,933
You're trading in the midget for a spaz?

380
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,147
This is going to be even sadder.

381
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:15,197
We'll see. Your ball.

382
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:16,447
Oops.

383
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:17,782
I'm not very good.

384
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:21,945
That's all right. Just try to stay
confident, and if I say shoot it, shoot it.

385
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,918
Game on.

386
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,955
He may be big, but he's ugly, Benny.

387
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:30,497
Good luck, chump.

388
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:33,258
- I'll take that.
- Hey!

389
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:36,961
Put it up.

390
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:40,302
Coming through!

391
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,517
That's all right, just keep your
elbow in. Now stick it, kid.

392
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:47,146
Yeah!

393
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,729
Looks like you better
start showing the spaz some respect.

394
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:52,649
Just keep playing.

395
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:03,657
Where am I going, baby?
Where am I going? Oh, snap. Oh, snap.

396
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:05,704
- Trap him.
- I'm on it.

397
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:08,875
It's all you, buddy.

398
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:12,342
I hope you all like your jockstraps
extra sweaty.

399
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:14,878
One. Two.

400
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:16,885
Three.

401
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:20,223
- You wanna win this or not?
- Yeah.

402
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:22,345
Well, then cover the nerd.

403
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,849
The saga continues.

404
00:27:31,906 --> 00:27:34,113
Not this time, little man.

405
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:37,365
Hey, look what I still got.

406
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,246
Yeah, good coverage.

407
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:43,829
What a shot.

408
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:47,835
I call that the
top-of-the-key-eat-the-jockstrap shot.

409
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:58,008
Hold it now. Hold it now.

410
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:01,427
Where's it going now?

411
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:03,848
How's he doing that?

412
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:06,017
Oh, boy.

413
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,932
Put it up, Ben.

414
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:10,602
Got a piece!

415
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,064
Bam! Got a piece of my ass.

416
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:15,238
Shut up!

417
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:18,239
One more basket and it's chow time,
boys.

418
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:28,583
Let's bring it home.

419
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:31,383
You're my boy, Benny.

420
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:41,096
Whoa, little lverson.

421
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,015
- Double up on Stone!
- You got it!

422
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:47,724
Put it up, Benny.

423
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,059
What's happening?

424
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:52,396
- No!
- Oh, Benny!

425
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:54,075
You gotta be kidding me!

426
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:55,274
Yeah!

427
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,362
Now say what I told you to say.

428
00:28:58,664 --> 00:29:01,868
Eat that nut-strap, bitch!

429
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,491
Benjamin!

430
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:09,798
Don't ever use that kind of language
again. Do you hear me?

431
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:11,290
I'm sorry.

432
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:13,136
He's just having some fun.

433
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:18,180
Cursing and acting like a jerk may be
your idea of fun, but it won't be his.

434
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:20,849
One Davey Stone around here is enough.

435
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:26,390
My finger's in your mouth, kitty...

436
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:29,855
But I don't feel no teeth.

437
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:31,697
Let's go, Benjamin.

438
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:37,401
Why are you eating that?

439
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:42,912
You know, my mother doesn't like you
very much.

440
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:46,254
You know, I don't like me
very much either.

441
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,709
Nice playing with you, mini-Shaq.

442
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,303
Why was she looking at me like that?

443
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:02,978
How could they let that guy
work with kids?

444
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,313
Giving me those nasty eyes.

445
00:30:05,943 --> 00:30:07,485
I was being nice to her kid.

446
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:10,020
They should have locked him up for good.

447
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:13,068
At least she was looking at me.
That felt all right.

448
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:15,694
Why can't he just be like he used to be?

449
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,874
<i>It all seems so long ago</i>

450
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:25,205
<i>young and happy don't you know</i>

451
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:28,873
<i>down by the creek I would show</i>

452
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:32,047
<i>fireflies to that girl</i>

453
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:35,637
<i>but that was back when he was nice</i>

454
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:39,225
<i>before my warm heart turned to ice</i>

455
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:42,894
<i>my sister's wig once had lice</i>

456
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:46,316
<i>but that was long ago</i>

457
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:50,152
<i>the schoolyard's where we were</i>

458
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:52,903
<i>the first time I kissed her</i>

459
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,739
<i>he thought he got some tongue</i>

460
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,288
<i>but it was only retainer</i>

461
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:02,121
<i>Eleanor's bra is a trainer</i>

462
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,581
<i>well, over there's my family home</i>

463
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:09,258
<i>and the woods we used to roam</i>

464
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,837
<i>the only time I had sex was on the phone</i>

465
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:14,550
<i>but that was long ago</i>

466
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,594
<i>i carved our names upon that tree</i>

467
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:22,396
<i>i loved him and he loved me</i>

468
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:26,142
<i>my darling wife was once a he</i>

469
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:29,397
<i>but that was long ago</i>

470
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:32,574
<i>he'd always whisper in my ear</i>

471
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:36,118
<i>but then I started drinking beer</i>

472
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:41,627
<i>my jewels got licked by six frisky deer</i>

473
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:47,549
<i>now he's just a loner and a liar</i>

474
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:50,546
<i>and my trailer's caught on fire</i>

475
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,751
fire?!

476
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,221
Oh, my God!

477
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:59,763
Be careful!

478
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:17,323
Maybe it's some kind of sign.

479
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:21,033
After all, Hanukkah is the festival
of lights.

480
00:32:21,335 --> 00:32:24,206
I should stick you on a twig and roast
you.

481
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:28,502
Just get back in my car. You'll stay
with me and my sister for a while.

482
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:30,378
I ain't living with you buffoons.

483
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:34,178
What other options do you got,
Mr. rockefeller?

484
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,522
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, is Ophelia there?</i>

485
00:32:47,738 --> 00:32:51,238
- Ophelia who?
<i>- Ophelia hiney.</i>

486
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,120
Oh, feel my hiney?

487
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,781
You hoodlums better bring my wig back!
I know it was you!

488
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:14,723
It's a home-invasion robbery!

489
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:19,973
Take whatever you want, but please
don't chop my legs off!

490
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:22,431
It's okay, Eleanor, it's okay.

491
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,111
Whitey, thank God you're here. We're
being robbed by a lunatic.

492
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:30,572
Mister, if you're going to kill us, take
off your wet shoes.

493
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:33,114
They're soaking the carpet.

494
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:37,153
Eleanor, that's Davey Stone, my new
partner.

495
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:42,457
The criminal?! Did he force you to
bring him here so he could molest you?

496
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:49,091
His home just went up in flames. So I
invited him to stay with us for a while.

497
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:56,599
Okay, but I'm making an inventory...

498
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,604
Of every single item in this house.

499
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:00,845
Fascinating.

500
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:06,148
Look! He already stole something.
He's hiding it in his jacket.

501
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,853
I didn't steal this.
It's a card my parents gave me.

502
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:11,825
So why don't you go stay with them?

503
00:34:11,993 --> 00:34:13,024
They died.

504
00:34:13,244 --> 00:34:14,787
My bad.

505
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:18,992
Here's to you guys for letting me
crash over.

506
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:24,081
Alcohol in our house?
This is never going to work.

507
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:29,215
It will. We just need to set some rules
so Davey knows how we do things here.

508
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:31,172
I'm scared.

509
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:35,724
Look. You gotta understand it's just
been me and Eleanor for 67 years...

510
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:38,260
So she gets nervous around
strangers.

511
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:40,472
I wouldn't show that picture to anyone...

512
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:43,400
Or they may try to take you two back
to the laboratory.

513
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:45,853
Listen. We got rules in this house...

514
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:49,522
And you better follow them or you'll
find yourself out of here.

515
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:53,778
This might be harder than I thought.

516
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:58,870
<i>If you're coming from the street</i>
<i>with dirty shoes on your feet</i>

517
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:00,911

531
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:42,576

532
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:46,506

534

<i>a technical foul</i>

535
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:55,424
let me get this straight. You expect me
to change my lifestyle in one night...

536
00:35:55,602 --> 00:35:58,556
Because you guys are a couple of
psychotic control freaks?

537
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,268
- You got it, bub.
- Or you can go rot in the gutter.

538
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:04,277
- It's up to you, yankee doodle.
- I don't want to do that...

539
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:07,979
But let me run a few questions by you
so I don't screw up accidentally.

540
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:12,699
<i>If I don't spray lysol</i>
<i>after moving a bowel?</i>

541
00:36:12,912 --> 00:36:14,786
<i>That's a technical foul</i>

542
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,158
<i>if I decide to wash my ass</i>
<i>with your monogrammed towel?</i>

543
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,296
<i>- That's a technical foul</i>
- please, say "hiney."

544
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:27,631
<i>If I make fun of your crazy feeties</i>

545
00:36:27,844 --> 00:36:30,798
<i>or give sugar cookies to miss diabetes</i>

546
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:33,131
<i>that's not only a technical foul</i>

547
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:37,020
<i>but possibly a homicide</i>

548
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:42,189
<i>can I sleep past 3?</i>

549

<i>If you do, you'll get a t</i>

550

<i>- take a whiz in those flowers?</i>
<i>- I'll say, "hit the showers"</i>

551
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:51,157
<i>- u se this horn as a bong?</i>
- Adi�s<i>, Tommy Chong</i>

553
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:55,909
<i>You'll get a kick in the balls</i>
oops!

554
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:59,208
<i>Can I walk around with</i>
<i>my morning erection?</i>

555
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:02,503
<i>If you want an automatic ejection</i>

558
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,299
just kidding.

559
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:15,557
<i>There are certain rules</i>

hoo! Hoo!

570
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:55,887
- Oh, my God.
- Don't laugh at her.

571
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:59,976
<i>Or it's a technical foul</i>

<i>Davey will have to make the best of this.</i>

575
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:20,535
- I guess I got to make the best of this.
<i>- See. I told you.</i>

576
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:25,836
<i>But that shouldn't be too hard for him.</i>
<i>Even loners need company sometimes.</i>

577
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,589
Shaving the chest.

578
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:32,967
Nobody needs a uni-brow.

579
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,934
This is going to scare her silly.

580
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,303
Yeah, it is.

581
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:40,889
Peanuts for me?

582
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,784
- Wish we were taller, Eleanor?
- I can't reach the cobwebs.

583
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,295
- Thank you, Davey.
- No problem, Eleanor.

584
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,298
Good one, Eleanor.

585
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,228
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a good day.

586
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,478
Good luck, old man.

587
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:30,366
Now I can understand wrapping
the cornmeal around the hot dog...

588
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:33,413
But why the heck would they shove
this stick in here?

589
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,908
I'm getting exhausted
trying to cut around it.

590
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:40,703
You're supposed to hold the stick
and just eat the corn dog off of it.

591
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:44,049
How futuristic.

592
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:45,669
Oh, my God.

593
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:49,713
Zip up or you'll catch a throat cold.

594
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:51,675
Thank you.

595
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,055
Hey, Benny!

596
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:58,562
Nice game against Saint Catherine's
today. How many buckets you score?

597
00:39:58,732 --> 00:39:59,763
Fourteen.

598
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:02,065
You're gonna be league-high scorer, kid.

599
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,688
You just got to keep your elbows in.

600
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:06,565
That's my man.

601
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:18,376
Hey, you two, just doing circles.

602
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:22,750
Oopsy-doodle!

603
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:27,462
Yeah!

604
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:29,263
I haven't done that in a while.

605
00:40:29,473 --> 00:40:34,135
Maybe I'm so excited about the banquet
tonight, it's giving me extra oomph.

606
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:39,389
You'll extra-oomph yourself right into
another seizure if you don't calm down.

607
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:42,859
He'll be all right. How'd you get
so good on the ice, anyways?

608
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,689
In the '50s I reffed youth hockey
for a couple of seasons.

609
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:50,407
Until a wrist shot caught him in the
back of the skull.

610
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,538
Nothing a little metal plate couldn't fix.

611
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,913
He was in a coma for three months.

612
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:58,332
I needed the rest anyway.

613
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:04,673
Could I get a lift from you, partner?

614
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:05,875
Sure.

615
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:13,174
So, Davey, did you play the hockey
when you were a child?

616
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:15,434
No, hockey players get up too early.

617
00:41:15,646 --> 00:41:19,727
This guy's sport always was and always
will be basketball.

618
00:41:19,942 --> 00:41:21,271
Back in '81...

619
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:24,897
He was the star of what is still
known to this very day...

620
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:27,742
As the jcc miracle game.

621
00:41:27,993 --> 00:41:29,024
Oh, my.

622
00:41:29,202 --> 00:41:31,824
<i>The jcc was down by 24 points.</i>

623
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,951
The bad news is we stand no chance
of winning this game.

624
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:39,247
The good news is it's Hanukkah,
so you'll all get presents tonight anyway.

625
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:40,999
Speaking of presents...

626
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:44,584
Our parents come to all our games
even though we always lose.

627
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,082
So I was thinking...

628
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:50,260
Maybe tonight we could try to win one
for them. You know, as a gift.

629
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:53,802
The only way that'll happen is if you
take all the shots.

630
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,805
Well, if you guys don't mind...

631
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:58,430
- It's okay with us.
- Go for it. You got it.

632
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:00,186
Let's win!

633
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:02,151
Where are your parents, anyways?

634
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:07,234
I don't know. Hopefully, out
getting me an atari.

635
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:17,407
All right, Davey!

636
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:35,598
- Come on!
- Let's go!

637
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:39,521
We'll take that.

638
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:44,446
Not today.

639
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:55,083
That kind of shooting makes me
want to do the robot dance.

640
00:43:05,428 --> 00:43:06,804
Nice story. You can stop now.

641
00:43:07,013 --> 00:43:10,513
No, no, go on. Whitey, I'm mesmerized.

642
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:12,392
Can we just go? I'm cold.

643
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:16,517
I want to hear what happens next.
It's like a fairy tale.

644
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:21,648
Unfortunately, this fairy tale
doesn't have a happy ending.

645
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:38,037
<i>Davey was wondering</i>
<i>where his parents were.</i>

646
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:41,083
<i>Turns out they were on their way</i>
<i>to the ball game...</i>

647
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:46,590
<i>... When a truck hit a patch of black ice</i>
<i>and swerved into oncoming traffic.</i>

648
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:51,597
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Stone tragically</i>
<i>couldn't get out of the way in time.</i>

649
00:43:52,102 --> 00:43:54,593
<i>I couldn't believe something</i>
<i>that horrible...</i>

650
00:43:54,813 --> 00:43:58,099
<i>... Could happen to a kid that nice.</i>

651
00:43:58,317 --> 00:44:02,397
<i>He walked right through that door</i>
<i>and into foster home after foster home...</i>

652
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:05,323
<i>... Until his 18th birthday.</i>

653
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,786
Oh, my. You poor, poor boy.
What in heaven's name did you do?

654
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:14,280
Let's just get off of this.

655
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:17,074
He didn't know how to handle it.

656
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:21,340
<i>What 12-year-old kid would?</i>
<i>He basically shut down.</i>

657
00:44:32,978 --> 00:44:37,973
Davey, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

658
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:40,648
There's nothing to say.
My parents are dead.

659
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:43,732
Happy Hanukkah.
Now, leave me alone.

660
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:50,152
That's the saddest story I've ever heard.

661
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,540
I'm out of here.
I don't need this sympathy crap.

662
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:05,968
Maybe it's time you stop running
from your emotions.

663
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:08,345
I'm not. I'm running from two crybabies...

664
00:45:08,516 --> 00:45:11,517
Who won't shut up about something
that isn't their business.

665
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:14,728
You know, I read recently
in <i>reader's digest...</i>

666
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:18,807
That people who let themselves cry
when they're hurting...

667
00:45:19,027 --> 00:45:21,316
Are often stronger than the people...

668
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:24,857
Who try to hold all their pain inside.

669
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:28,444
Did you read about a deformed referee
who spends 35 years...

670
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,494
Trying to win some stupid patch...

671
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:33,665
So he can pretend people
actually like him?!

672
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:36,118
Which month was that in?

673
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:38,330
Take that back.

674
00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:41,751
If they have an award for the
freakiest looking fraternal twins...

675
00:45:41,926 --> 00:45:45,425
Who no one even gives a crap about,
you two are definitely winning.

676
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:48,509
But that patch thing ain't ever
gonna happen for you...

677
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:52,847
Because the truth is, nobody
in this town even knows you exist!

678
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:55,807
You're an animal.

679
00:45:55,982 --> 00:45:57,145
And you're bald!

680
00:45:57,317 --> 00:45:59,689
Not again!

681
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:03,979
You're not welcome in my house.

682
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:05,984
Good, your house sucks!

683
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:09,405
Do you have to be nasty to everyone
who tries to help you?

684
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:10,784
That's my problem.

685
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,493
He just a no-goodnik.

686
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:18,536
And I am the real kristi yamaguchi.

687
00:46:21,676 --> 00:46:26,338
<i>Wow. Just when you started to really</i>
<i>like Davey, he has a butthole relapse.</i>

688
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,928
Hey, fellas.

689
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,717
<i>You know, Eleanor really does</i>
<i>look like an owl.</i>

690
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:35,053
<i>Sorry.</i>

691
00:46:36,024 --> 00:46:37,982
Cheer up, Eleanor.
Let's just get ready for the banquet.

692
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:46,866
It doesn't hurt to smell nice. Does it,
fellas?

693
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:48,744
You're a good deer.

694
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:55,200
Let's try the red wig. And please,
don't crap on my carpet.

695
00:46:56,462 --> 00:47:00,295
<i>Well, while Whitey and Eleanor</i>
<i>are getting ready for the banquet...</i>

696
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:03,468
<i>... The moron is having a party of his own.</i>

697
00:47:03,803 --> 00:47:06,295
<i>And when people get in the state</i>
<i>that Davey's in...</i>

698
00:47:06,473 --> 00:47:08,631
<i>... They do really stupid things...</i>

699
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:11,216
<i>... Like go to a mall that's obviously</i>
<i>closed...</i>

700
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:14,936
<i>... To yell at a woman who's obviously</i>
<i>not there.</i>

701
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:18,562
Shut up!

702
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:24,315
Jennifer!

703
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:26,737
Jennifer!

704
00:47:26,994 --> 00:47:30,364
What's the matter with the way I live
my life? Huh, Jennifer?!

705
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:34,330
Where are you?! Home reading
your baby boy a bedtime story...

706
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:38,245
While he sucks his thumb
and goes pee-pee on his blanket?!

707
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:40,049
Horseshit!

708
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:44,588
Look who finally showed up.
We've been waiting for you all night.

709
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:46,045
Who said that?

710
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:48,590
I said that. Everybody wake up!

711
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:50,345
This is not a rehearsal.

712
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:51,889
Numb-nuts is here.

713
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,224
Roger on that. Over.

714
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,349
Let's do this, people.

715
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:59,361
Just let me put my teeth in.

716
00:48:01,614 --> 00:48:02,895
How do you like your java?

717
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:04,693
With a shot of whiskey.

718
00:48:04,909 --> 00:48:07,483
Let's try it black instead.

719
00:48:08,204 --> 00:48:09,615
That burns!

720
00:48:09,831 --> 00:48:12,666
Wake up, kids.
Our hot and sour friend is here.

721
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:15,708
We're coming!

722
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:19,338
It's about time you got here.

723
00:48:19,508 --> 00:48:21,251
I've been tossing and turning.

724
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:23,876
I know. I was watching you.

725
00:48:24,513 --> 00:48:26,553
I mean, me too.

726
00:48:26,766 --> 00:48:28,842
What the heck is happening right now?

727
00:48:29,018 --> 00:48:31,390
Something that should have happened
20 years ago.

728
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:33,063
Time to cry, Davey. Over.

729
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:35,431
What? Get out of here. I'm leaving.

730
00:48:35,692 --> 00:48:39,025
You can run from Whitey,
but you ain't gonna run from us.

731
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,694
<i>We all heard what happened</i>
<i>at the skating rink today</i>

732
00:48:45,744 --> 00:48:49,742
<i>when Whitey brought up your sad past</i>
<i>you snapped and walked away</i>

733
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:55,289
<i>well, maybe they're onto something</i>
<i>that you should give a try</i>

734
00:48:55,546 --> 00:49:00,124
<i>go ahead and let it out</i>
<i>and have yourself a cry</i>

735
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:02,549
<i>let it out, Davey</i>

736
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:05,217
<i>shut your wooden mugs</i>

737
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:07,922
<i>let it out, Davey</i>

738
00:49:08,142 --> 00:49:10,764
<i>would you check out her bezugs</i>

739
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:15,226
<i>you want me to deal with pain</i>
<i>well, "cheers" is what I say</i>

740
00:49:15,984 --> 00:49:20,611
<i>this here stuff just numbs the pain</i>
<i>it don't make it go away</i>

741
00:49:20,822 --> 00:49:22,945
<i>you try to act so tough</i>

742
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:25,614
<i>but you just live a lie</i>

743
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:30,786
<i>why don't you show your feminine side</i>
<i>and have yourself a cry</i>

744
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,573
<i>let it out, Davey</i>

745
00:49:33,794 --> 00:49:35,668
<i>I'll pour you down the sink</i>

746
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:38,792
<i>you gotta do it, Davey</i>

747
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:41,464
<i>y'all can bite my dink</i>

748
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:48,550
<i>you labels and logos are wasting</i>
<i>your time making me sit here</i>

749
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:53,763
<i>'cause nothing you can say or do</i>
<i>will make me shed a tear</i>

750
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,432
<i>he possesses a strong spirit</i>

751
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,437
<i>and won't let down his guard</i>

752
00:49:58,654 --> 00:50:01,275
<i>so now we'll bring in the big gun</i>

753
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:04,735
<i>his beautiful Hanukkah card</i>

754
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:08,449
take it, Davey. It might have money in it.
Over.

755
00:50:15,463 --> 00:50:20,802
<i>Happy Hanukkah to our wonderful son</i>

756
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,841
<i>you fill our lives</i>

757
00:50:24,264 --> 00:50:27,218
<i>with joy</i>

758
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:30,383
<i>don't ever change</i>

759
00:50:30,646 --> 00:50:33,812
<i>the way you are</i>

760
00:50:35,484 --> 00:50:38,319
<i>you beautiful</i>

761
00:50:38,612 --> 00:50:41,816
<i>twelve-year-old</i>

762
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:44,950
<i>boy</i>

763
00:50:54,504 --> 00:50:55,998
breaking and entering.

764
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:58,842
I knew you'd screw up eventually, Stone.

765
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:03,000
- I'm sorry.
- Save your sorries for the judge.

766
00:51:11,564 --> 00:51:12,726
This is embarrassing.

767
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:24,066
- Come on, guys.
- Okay, sweetheart.

768
00:51:26,371 --> 00:51:28,410
Don't be sad, mom. I can be your date.

769
00:51:28,873 --> 00:51:31,199
You should let me be your date.

770
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:37,209
I may be dirty and smelly,
but in the dark, I'm just smelly.

771
00:51:38,383 --> 00:51:41,384
Well, thank you, but he asked first.

772
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:45,219
Oh, my God. Slow down.
Come on. I'm scared.

773
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:48,926
Hey, why are we stopped now?
What are you doing? What's going on?

774
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:51,470
Who's out there?
Do we need to call the police?

775
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:54,981
Don't worry, Eleanor. I promise
you'll have a good time.

776
00:51:55,193 --> 00:51:58,776
All right, brother. Let's go win this thing.

777
00:52:05,245 --> 00:52:10,156
You look like Audrey hepburn if she was
four feet and weighed 300 pounds.

778
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:11,959
Thank you.

779
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:14,661
Watch the ice, Eleanor. Don't slip.

780
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,956
It's all good, Whitey.

781
00:52:19,093 --> 00:52:21,928
Eleanor Duval? Is that you?

782
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,638
Why do you want to know?

783
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:25,342
What can we do you for, bub?

784
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:28,476
I've been waiting to see your sister
for many years.

785
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:31,481
Are you the kid who stole my wig?

786
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:34,180
Yes, I'm Eli wolstan...

787
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,977
And I've always felt bad about being
so thoughtless when I was young.

788
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,153
So I wanted to return this to you.

789
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,813
Thank you.

790
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:45,484
Feel better?

791
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,947
One more thing.

792
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,164
Now I feel better.

793
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:59,302
At least this one make me look pretty.

794
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:05,599
<i>Attention all officers.</i>
<i>Davey Stone is on the loose.</i>

795
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,860
<i>Last bus to New York City now boarding.</i>

796
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:28,950
Whitey, they were giving out lobster
bibs in the bathroom.

797
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:33,875
That's not a lobster bib, Eleanor.
That's a germ protector for your tushy.

798
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,416
Okay. Well, I'll use it here.

799
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:42,673
My hiney is germfree and I love it.

800
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:47,102
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm mayor stuey duhy.

801
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,641
I'd like to welcome you to the
35th annual...

802
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:52,690
Youth league basketball
all-star banquet.

803
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:59,942
For those of you celebrating Christmas
tomorrow, merry Christmas.

804
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,817
Merry Christmas.

805
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:04,994
For those of you celebrating
the eighth night of Hanukkah...

806
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:06,823
Happy Hanukkah.

807
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:08,991
Happy Hanukkah.

808
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:12,538
Going to the big apple, son?

809
00:54:13,254 --> 00:54:14,499
Yeah.

810
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:15,871
Business or pleasure?

811
00:54:16,716 --> 00:54:17,748
Freedom.

812
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:21,171
I see. You're one of them
hippie-dippy fellas.

813
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:24,552
Everyone knows I like to start
these events with a joke.

814
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:27,554
But I've been so busy at the hardware
store this year...

815
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:32,598
I've had no time to think of a great
one. But I thought of this driving here:

816
00:54:32,858 --> 00:54:34,021
Knock, knock.

817
00:54:34,235 --> 00:54:35,693
Who's there?

818
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:38,531
- Don't you.
- Don't you, who?

819
00:54:38,698 --> 00:54:41,734
Don't you wish I hadn't been so busy
at the hardware store...

820
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:44,240
And had more time to think
of a great one?

821
00:55:12,316 --> 00:55:14,274
Mom, I didn't get that one.

822
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:17,937
I don't think anybody did.
People just try to be nice to the mayor.

823
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:21,111
It's gonna be a good night. Let's get to it.

824
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:25,573
The award for most impressive growth
goes to a kid who began at 4-foot-2.

825
00:55:25,747 --> 00:55:30,575
He is now about to take the stage
at his current height of 6-foot-5.

826
00:55:30,752 --> 00:55:32,295
Donald Hardy!

827
00:55:32,504 --> 00:55:33,749
Get up here, you beanpole.

828
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,422
Saint lgnatius is number one!

829
00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:41,630
Hopefully that young man's getting
a weed whacker for Christmas.

830
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:44,304
The mayor is very funny.

831
00:55:55,195 --> 00:55:59,323
<i>Look at Davey, inches</i>
<i>from a clean getaway.</i>

832
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:02,736
<i>But there's some things you</i>
<i>just aren't meant to get away from.</i>

833
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,110
What the hey?

834
00:56:06,456 --> 00:56:10,324
Whoa! Whoa! Hang in there, Betsy!
We'll make it! Whoa!

835
00:56:10,794 --> 00:56:13,083
Nice driving skills, pal.

836
00:56:15,966 --> 00:56:18,125
That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.

837
00:56:18,302 --> 00:56:21,007
One thumbtack popped all eight
of my back tires.

838
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:28,802
Okay. I see what you're doing.

839
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:33,349
Who you talking to? Having one of
them hippie-dippy mushroom flashbacks?

840
00:56:33,568 --> 00:56:36,486
I need to go apologize to someone
before I leave.

841
00:56:36,697 --> 00:56:40,315
I know you hippies don't wear watches,
but it should be fixed in 30 minutes.

842
00:56:40,576 --> 00:56:41,821
I'll see you then.

843
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:44,200
Run, hippie! Run!

844
00:56:48,834 --> 00:56:51,871
I'm just here to say I'm sorry
to the little guy. I swear.

845
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:56,175
If I give myself a wedgie
will you believe me then?

846
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:05,882
Okay?

847
00:57:09,815 --> 00:57:12,021
Glad we could work that out.

848
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:16,026
I can't believe I'm in the same room
as the mayor.

849
00:57:16,196 --> 00:57:19,530
I can't believe how many rolls
you put in your purse.

850
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,369
It'll be a nice snack for February.

851
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:26,536
Ladies and gentlemen, this next award,
the dukesberry all-star patch...

852
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:30,919
Was created 35 years ago to recognize
people for their tireless work ethic...

853
00:57:31,087 --> 00:57:32,878
Their unparalleled generosity...

854
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:36,880
And their passion and dedication to
both the league and our fine community.

855
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:41,554
Your hands are sopping wet.
Don't be so nervous, Whitey.

856
00:57:41,723 --> 00:57:43,763
I'm not nervous. I'm excited.

857
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:47,760
I've been waiting 35 years
for this night.

858
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,613
- You see something?
- Just some deer doing a pyramid.

859
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:04,786
Okay, well, let's keep looking.

860
00:58:08,126 --> 00:58:09,585
Good job, fellas.

861
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:13,461
Hand-picked by you,
the people of our fine town...

862
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:16,793
I now present the 35th annual...

863
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,462
Dukesberry all-star patch award...

864
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:21,760
To...

865
00:58:22,182 --> 00:58:23,926
Please let there be a miracle.

866
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:28,512
Tom baltezor.

867
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:31,442
Tom, come up here and get this sucker.

868
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,729
Attaboy, Tommy!

869
00:58:57,136 --> 00:58:59,045
We love you, Tommy!

870
00:59:09,399 --> 00:59:12,850
<i>Nobody in this town even knows</i>
<i>you exist!</i>

871
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:22,193
All you people can bite
my germfree Booty!

872
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,705
Looks like I better do a lot more than
apologize. See you in 10 years, fellas.

873
00:59:31,755 --> 00:59:34,922
When I was a kid playing youth
league ball for Palmer episcopal...

874
00:59:35,092 --> 00:59:36,884
I dreamed of two things:

875
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:41,887
Learning to make a lay-up with my left
hand and becoming a multi-billionaire.

876
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,385
I think you all know which dream
came true.

877
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:47,520
Wow!

878
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:51,354
Sorry! That one caught me by surprise.

879
00:59:52,694 --> 00:59:58,033
And even though I don't recall scoring a
point during my four seasons of play...

880
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:01,535
The memories of the fun times
I did have...

881
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:05,364
Made it very easy for me to purchase
the new digital scoreboard...

882
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:09,040
For the community centre
earlier this year.

883
01:00:09,253 --> 01:00:10,712
Thanks for the recognition.

884
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,585
- Thanks for the scoreboard!
- Thank you, Tommy!

885
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:17,760
Excuse me! Can I just say something?

886
01:00:17,971 --> 01:00:20,259
- There he is!
- Stone, what are you doing here?

887
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:23,558
Getting himself arrested, mayor duhy.
He broke into the mall.

888
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:26,259
I love it! Your ass busted!

889
01:00:26,479 --> 01:00:29,149
Now you go to jail
and marry big, smelly man.

890
01:00:29,399 --> 01:00:31,439
Stone, you screwed up for the last time.

891
01:00:31,652 --> 01:00:34,771
That 10-year sentence I promised you
starts tonight.

892
01:00:37,658 --> 01:00:40,612
Please, just let me speak for one second.

893
01:00:41,078 --> 01:00:42,572
Are those tears in his eyes?

894
01:00:42,788 --> 01:00:44,199
Finally.

895
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:46,458
Let the guy talk!

896
01:00:48,586 --> 01:00:50,626
After all, it is the holidays.

897
01:00:52,674 --> 01:00:56,125
She's right. And then we'll
send him up the river.

898
01:00:59,097 --> 01:01:02,466
Okay, Mrs. triple nipple...
I mean, Mrs. selman.

899
01:01:02,684 --> 01:01:05,769
Go ahead, Mr. Stone. Let's hear
your parting words of wisdom.

900
01:01:05,979 --> 01:01:10,476
I know you people don't like me or
care about my opinion, but here goes.

901
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:15,153
Tommy, nothing personal, but Whitey
should have won the patch tonight.

902
01:01:15,364 --> 01:01:17,938
You're all crazy for not realizing that.

903
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:22,451
Why would we give Whitey Duval the
patch? So he could use it as a blanket?

904
01:01:31,506 --> 01:01:33,665
That's the reaction I thought I'd get.

905
01:01:34,384 --> 01:01:37,136
<i>Everyone in this room has been</i>
<i>associated with Whitey</i>

906
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:38,882
<i>through basketball or the mall</i>

907
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:44,478
<i>or various odd jobs he does around</i>
<i>town for free or at most a dollar</i>

908
01:01:45,479 --> 01:01:48,729
<i>and I'm guessing 99% of you have</i>
<i>either laughed in Whitey's face</i>

909
01:01:48,983 --> 01:01:52,316
<i>or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or</i>
<i>voice or sister or shortness</i>

910
01:01:52,486 --> 01:01:56,319
<i>when he wasn't looking</i>

911
01:01:56,532 --> 01:02:00,364
<i>but the next time you'd see him, he'd go</i>
<i>out of his way to smile and wave at you</i>

912
01:02:00,578 --> 01:02:02,701
<i>and ask about your mother's operation</i>

913
01:02:02,914 --> 01:02:07,375
<i>because he, unlike us, actually</i>
<i>cares about someone other than himself</i>

914
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:12,340
<i>the reason I bring this up to you</i>

915
01:02:12,507 --> 01:02:17,502
<i>is because I was the worst offender</i>

916
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,968
<i>of all</i>

917
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:25,686
<i>my life was simply going nowhere</i>

918
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:29,688
<i>then a tiny, little man</i>
<i>rushed to my side</i>

919
01:02:30,777 --> 01:02:34,193
<i>he should've gotten a big thank-you</i>

920
01:02:35,114 --> 01:02:38,365
<i>instead he got a port-a-potty ride</i>

921
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:42,200
<i>i was such a shithead</i>

922
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:45,955
<i>but he never quit on me</i>

923
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:50,922
<i>till I told him he was useless</i>

924
01:02:51,173 --> 01:02:54,459
<i>and his sister was freaky</i>

925
01:02:54,718 --> 01:02:58,218
<i>once when we were watching</i>
<i>Sunday football</i>

926
01:02:58,723 --> 01:03:03,219
<i>a fuzzy screen was all that</i>
<i>we could see</i>

927
01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:06,598
<i>Whitey came over with a hanger</i>

928
01:03:07,315 --> 01:03:10,316
<i>and spent the game on top of our tv</i>

929
01:03:10,568 --> 01:03:13,984
<i>and when the lightning struck him</i>

930
01:03:14,406 --> 01:03:17,075
<i>he let out a wicked-loud yell</i>

931
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:22,575
<i>but we just turned up the volume</i>

932
01:03:22,998 --> 01:03:25,074
<i>and ignored the burning smell</i>

933
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,086
<i>we should all rot in hell</i>

934
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:31,959
<i>i went to high school with Whitey</i>

935
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:36,459
<i>as a joke I told him to meet me</i>
<i>at the prom</i>

936
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:41,260
<i>when he got there I said, "I can't</i>
<i>believe you thought I was serious"</i>

937
01:03:41,476 --> 01:03:44,643
<i>so he ran home crying and slow-danced</i>
<i>with his mom</i>

938
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:49,148
<i>what a crushing blow to Whitey</i>

939
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,444
<i>i bet you wish you could take it back</i>

940
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:55,985
<i>how could you all be so mean to Whitey?</i>

941
01:03:57,493 --> 01:03:59,984
<i>Sound to me like you are all on crack</i>

942
01:04:00,246 --> 01:04:01,277
huh?

943
01:04:01,497 --> 01:04:05,495
<i>Tonight Whitey was counting on this town</i>

944
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:09,494
<i>to show that we care</i>

945
01:04:09,714 --> 01:04:13,213
<i>but the first time he really needed us</i>

946
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:15,549
<i>we weren't there</i>

947
01:04:15,804 --> 01:04:20,347
<i>and on Christmas Eve</i>
<i>and the last night of Hanukkah</i>

948
01:04:20,684 --> 01:04:24,812
<i>it's just not fair</i>

949
01:04:42,665 --> 01:04:44,492
<i>i wonder if that guy</i>

950
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:48,043
<i>ever wiped his ass with</i>
<i>the wrong hand</i>

951
01:04:48,588 --> 01:04:49,667
yes.

952
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:14,273
I'm so sorry they hurt you, Whitey.

953
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:17,028
We should go to the mall.

954
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:20,410
That place always makes me feel better.

955
01:05:20,622 --> 01:05:22,365
But it's closed.

956
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:26,995
Maybe the night guard
forgot to lock the door again.

957
01:05:27,212 --> 01:05:30,129
Well, if he didn't, we can at
least sit in front of it.

958
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,748
These are desperate times.

959
01:05:38,474 --> 01:05:42,341
Let the door be open.
Please, just give me that.

960
01:05:42,853 --> 01:05:45,095
Thank God.

961
01:05:45,773 --> 01:05:49,723
This is the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

962
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,773
It's like a sanctuary.

963
01:05:52,989 --> 01:05:58,232
Eleanor, could you just give me a
second to say a few words in private?

964
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:02,243
Take as much time as you need, Whitey.

965
01:06:07,754 --> 01:06:10,625
Hey, mall, long time no see.

966
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,175
Fourteen hours to be exact.

967
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,587
If you haven't heard by now...

968
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:21,971
I didn't get that patch I've been
telling you about for all these years.

969
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:25,686
In fact, I've been kind of kidding myself...

970
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:29,018
To even think I was in the running.

971
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,107
You see...

972
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,611
The people of dukesberry...

973
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:37,566
Think I'm nothing but a joke.

974
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:41,662
So I was kind of thinking...

975
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:47,212
Maybe I should move to a town
where nobody knows who I am.

976
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:52,760
At least then they'd have a
reason not to acknowledge me.

977
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:56,631
I think Eleanor might like Florida...

978
01:06:56,806 --> 01:07:01,931
And I hear they got some pretty
amazing malls there.

979
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:04,601
You're not going anywhere.

980
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:09,979
Holy shit, did the mall
just say something?

981
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:13,193
No, it was me.

982
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:16,192
What do you want, Stone?

983
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,652
I came to apologize, Whitey.

984
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,326
Well, there's nothing to apologize for,
Stone, because you were right.

985
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:25,998
Nobody does care about me.

986
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,788
I don't think that's true.
Do you, Mr. mayor?

987
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:35,840
Whitey, tonight for the first time
in years...

988
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:40,225
Your partner, Davey Stone, actually
did a good thing for this community.

989
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:43,057
What he do, steal beer for everyone?

990
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:48,350
No. He made me see how great Whitey
is and how neglectful we've all been.

991
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:52,729
That's why I'm here, Whitey.
I'm here to fix a big mistake.

992
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:58,073
<i>It's your moment, Whitey</i>

993
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:02,748
<i>you've waited oh, so long</i>

994
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:08,298
<i>it's your moment, Whitey</i>

995
01:08:09,174 --> 01:08:12,459
<i>we're here to right our wrong</i>

996
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,262
for service to the league and this
community, I proudly present to you...

997
01:08:17,474 --> 01:08:22,516
The 35th annual dukesberry
all-star patch.

998
01:08:23,355 --> 01:08:25,395
But this is tom's.

999
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:31,060
Mr. Duval, the 35th all-star
patch is now where it belongs.

1000
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:35,943
I can't believe this is happening.

1001
01:08:36,327 --> 01:08:37,905
And the 34th!

1002
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,956
And the 33rd!

1003
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:45,497
And the 32nd, and the 31st, and the 30th!

1004
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:46,916
- 29th!
- And the 16th!

1005
01:08:47,088 --> 01:08:48,499
- And the 28th!
- And the 23rd!

1006
01:08:48,715 --> 01:08:49,746
And the 27th!

1007
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,332
- Oh, Whitey.
- And the 11th!

1008
01:08:52,511 --> 01:08:54,254
- And the 25th!
- And the 18th!

1009
01:08:56,014 --> 01:08:57,094
We love you, Whitey!

1010
01:08:57,307 --> 01:09:01,934
You stepped up for me, Stone.
I don't know if I could ever repay you.

1011
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:04,472
Well, you can help me with my dream.

1012
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:07,775
You got a dream? What is it?

1013
01:09:08,027 --> 01:09:10,269
To have someone wish me
a happy Hanukkah...

1014
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,650
And feel as good as I used to
when my dad would say it to me.

1015
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:16,109
Happy Hanukkah, Stone.

1016
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:17,947
Merry Christmas, Whitey.

1017
01:09:19,706 --> 01:09:24,285
You know, Stone, if my imaginary wife
and I ever have a son...

1018
01:09:24,503 --> 01:09:26,958
I hope you consider him a brother.

1019
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:30,630
Thanks, Whitey. And I'll pretend
I never heard you say that.

1020
01:09:31,093 --> 01:09:32,124
Appreciate it.

1021
01:09:32,344 --> 01:09:37,469
<i>It's your moment, Whitey</i>

1022
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:42,304
<i>- enjoy, our tiny friend</i>
- thank you. Thank you.

1023
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,397
<i>Like the bavarian cream-filled donut</i>

1024
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,817
<i>you ate last week</i>

1025
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:51,359
thank you. Thank you.

1026
01:09:51,823 --> 01:09:53,816
Would you three show Whitey and I...

1027
01:09:53,992 --> 01:09:57,527
How to light the Hanukkah candles
at our house tonight?

1028
01:09:57,746 --> 01:09:58,861
You up for that, pal?

1029
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:00,908
And when Benjamin falls asleep...

1030
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:04,369
The both of you can play
spin the dreidel for tongue kisses.

1031
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:05,576
Sounds good to me.

1032
01:10:05,838 --> 01:10:10,714
Now, go live happily ever after or I'll
dropkick the teeth out of your mouth.

1033
01:10:10,926 --> 01:10:13,049
That won't be necessary.

1034
01:10:13,262 --> 01:10:16,299
They make a nice couple.

1035
01:10:17,308 --> 01:10:18,850
<i>I never</i>

1036
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:24,399
<i>want this to end</i>

1037
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:29,770
<i>don't worry, folks. Whitey's okay.</i>

1038
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:33,031
This is the happiest seizure of my life.

1039
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,231
<i>See, I told you.</i>
