-In the cloisters. East.

[Hundred Eyes]

What kind of monk is able to kill,
by himself, 25 Mongol soldiers?

19
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:27,625
Is it a form of dark magic
practiced at your temple?

20
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,878
You shall never know, shall you?

21
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,131
What did you just say, monk?

22
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,049
You destroyed a temple

23
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,427
and all of the ancient scrolls
that contained the answers you seek.

24
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:42,473
You monks were offering shelter
to my enemies in South China.

25
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,893
No place defies the Khan.

26
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,229
I will ask you again.

27
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,773
If you hold your tongue,
I will take your tongue.

28
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:54,068
What is this fighting art kept secret
in a mountain temple?

29
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,032
-The art of peace.
-[Kublai chuckles]

30
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,076
You break the necks of trained soldiers,

31
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,164
cut their throats,
gut them like wild pigs,

32
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,581
and you call it peace?

33
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:11,585
You destroy a temple and call it destiny?

34
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,217
Kings of the past
would not have shown you grace.

35
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:22,096
Me, when I make war on a city,

36
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,473
I allow the craftsmen to live.

37
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:29,062
I conscript them into service...
and they live.

38
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,979
Here.

39
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:38,071
You will reveal these Chinese secrets
to my war ministers.

40
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,451
Reveal Chinese secrets...
to fight the Chinese.

41
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:50,499
Prove yourself useful, you can live.

42
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,876
Defy my laws...

43
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,963
you'll die a death far worse
than that suffered by the monks

44
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,216

Oh, you find humor in my decree?

47
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,517
There is only one Supreme Executioner.

48
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,312
And those who try to take his place

49
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,566
are like children trying to carve wood
as a master carpenter.

50
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,112
Most will injure their own hands.

51
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,406
You do not fear death?

52
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,368
I do not cling to life.

53
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,162
There is a difference.

Remove him.

56
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,225
This wrestler is named Black Steppe Boar.

57
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,186
A prisoner captured in Scythia.

58
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:56,565
Do you know why
he is named after the boar?

59
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,318
His resemblance is extraordinary.

60
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:04,615
He is called Boar because he has killed
such without a weapon many times.

61
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:10,163
Boar will advance.
He will seize you.

62
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,041
You will demonstrate
how to break the grasp.

63
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,174
You cover my eyes?

64
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,008
Is that just?

65
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,431
The Great Khan wants a report
on how you fight blindfolded.

66
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,141
He is a most capricious fool.

67
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,852
And if you were not cowards,
you would tell him the same.

Black white crane.

that would bring me fortune, but...

that black white crane
refused to stay on my lake.

[Hundred Eyes] You must be the prince.

168
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,656
I am called Altai.

169
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,826
[Hundred Eyes] Why are you here?

170
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,161
[Altai] Lessons.

171
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,207
And what do you intend to teach me

172
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,210
in these... lessons?

173
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,797
I'm here to teach you
that even the son of a royal khan

174
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,550
is capable of humility and learning.

175
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,679
Then take the broom, Altai,
and sweep my floor.

176
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,560
[exhales]

177
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,356
Good answer.
If only you believed it.

178
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,872
You are a little nomad weed
in the garden of the world.

179
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:11,211
They wish you to grow
into a flowering tree.

180
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,927
What is the most important part
of such a tree?

181
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,141
The many branches and the flowering.

182
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,226
I speak of legacy.

183
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:31,398
Ah! Thank you for untangling
your elusive metaphor.

184
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,362
We begin with roots.

185
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,821
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

186
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,454
[Altai] May I ask a question?

187
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,538
Do.

188
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,872
Uh, uh, uh!

189
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,251
If you wish calligraphy on your wall,

190
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,795
why not summon a painter who can see?

191
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,298
Can you not read the character I made?

192
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,467
It is a symbol for fire.

193
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,052
Then what is wrong?

194
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,722
-It's upside down.
-Precisely.

195
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:51,978
This is the kung fu character
for patience, control.

196
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,022
Remember this in the future, always,

197
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,024
"Never give way to anger."

198
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,568
Sifu?

199
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,448
Have I not trained you
into exhausted silence yet?

200
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,994
Today's lesson is done,
My Radiant Highness.

201
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,629
[door closes]

202
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,032
You cannot see it, I know.
But...

203
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,038
I assure you it has been overseen
by a great Chinese architect...

204
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:58,878
made from the most precious
of woods and hides, and--

205
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,300
Imbecile.

206
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,888
Someone has painted the character
of fire upside down.

207
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,265
I did.

208
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,141
Hmm.

209
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,895
-[Kublai] Huh?
-[Hundred Eyes chuckles softly]

210
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,981
Hmm.

211
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,735
On this day of the New Year...

212
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:28,283
I ordain this place
the Hall of the Fourth Treasure.

213
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:32,537
I name you Hundred Eyes...

214
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,458
-[chuckles]
-...Minister of Martial Affairs.

215
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,627
And so...

216
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:44,131
I ask of you, as a Wudang priest,

217
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:47,009
give my son his Chinese name.

218
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:53,308
There have been 500 over time

219
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,853
who have held the name
Emperor of All China,

220
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,063
Son of Heaven.

221
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,567
Ordained by blood,

222
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,279
there are those who would have been
better suited to harvest cow dung

223
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,741
than to rule the greatest empire on earth.

224
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,453
There are those who were as silver,

225
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,581
a lesser metal, but worthy of coinage.

226
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,917
And then there are those...

227
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,211
like cold stone,

228
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,257
who force their strength and fury

229
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,176
and win the title
by fear and intimidation.

230
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,598
Blood is nothing.

231
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,018
Heart and spirit make the sage.

232
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,481
And by this...

233
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:46,235
I give this boy the name Jingim.

234
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,907
"True gold."

235
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,121
Hmm.

236
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,916
So be it.

237
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,585
He will walk out of here with this name,

238
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:07,674
and carry it as his own into a tomorrow
only the oracles can see.

239
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:14,972
As for you, priest...

240
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,686
this temple is yours.
