蒙古人
Mongols.

4
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,700
他们已经摧毁了北峰的道观
They have already destroyed the temple at North Peak.

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,610
-道姑在哪里  -在东边道观里
- Where are the nuns? - In the cloisters. East.

6
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,770
记住我们的誓言  我们会血战到底
Remember the oath. We fight to the end.

7
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,090
得道之人  生死一线
Life and death are one thread.

8
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,960
我会守护那些书卷
I will guard the scrolls.

李金宝
Li Jinbao!

10
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,320
别杀他
Do not kill him.

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,470
大汗要见他

到底是什么样的道士这么厉害
What kind of monk is able to kill,

15
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,090
能一人斩杀25名蒙古士兵呢
by himself, 25 Mongol soldiers?

16
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,520
这是你们道观里的巫术吗
Is it a form of dark magic practiced at your temple?

17
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,690
你永远无从得知
You shall never know, shall you?

18
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,230
你刚说什么
What did you just say, monk?

19
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,910
你刚摧毁了一座道观
You destroyed a temple

20
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,690
而那座道观内珍藏着无数古代卷轴
and all of the ancient scrolls

21
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,580
卷轴内就有你想知道的问题的答案
that contained the answers you seek.

22
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,760
你们在庇护南宋人  而他们是我的敌人
You monks were offering shelter to my enemies in South China.

23
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,120
无论什么地方都不能蔑视可汗的命令
No place defies the Khan.

24
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
我再问你一次
I will ask you again.

25
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,880
如果你还是不说  那你的舌头就不必留下了
If you hold your tongue, I will take your tongue.

26
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,150
你们藏匿在深山道观中的武艺到底是什么
What is this fighting art kept secret in a mountain temple?

27
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,230
和平之术
The art of peace.

28
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,170
你折断了精锐士兵的脖子
You break the necks of trained soldiers,

29
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,980
割开他们的喉咙  将他们像野猪一样开膛破肚
cut their throats, gut them like wild pigs,

30
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,640
你说这是和平
and you call it peace?

31
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,630
你毁了一座道观  还称其为命运使然呢
You destroy a temple and call it destiny?

32
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,890
若是先王  绝不会饶恕你
Kings of the past would not have shown you grace.

33
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,850
而我  当我攻打一座城池时
Me, when I make war on a city,

34
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,480
里面的手艺人我不会赶尽杀绝
I allow the craftsmen to live.

35
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,130
我征召他们  如此他们就得以活命
I conscript them into service... and they live.

36
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,830
看这里
Here.

37
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,020
你要把这种神秘的中原武艺告诉我的军政大臣
You will reveal these Chinese secrets to my war ministers.

38
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,480
教你们中原武艺  好让你们用来攻击中原人吗
Reveal Chinese secrets... to fight the Chinese.

39
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,860
证明你自己有用  你才能活下来
Prove yourself useful, you can live.

40
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,360
不服从我的命令
Defy my laws...

41
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,030
你的死法会比那些和卷轴一起死去的道士们
you'll die a death far worse than that suffered by the monks

42
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,290
可怕得多
who perished with your scrolls.

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
你觉得我的命令很可笑是吗
Oh, you find humor in my decree?

44
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,680
世上只有一个顶级刽子手
There is only one Supreme Executioner.

45
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,570
其他那些妄图取代他的人
And those who try to take his place

46
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,380
就好比班门弄斧
are like children trying to carve wood as a master carpenter.

47
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,340
大多只会伤了自己的手
Most will injure their own hands.

48
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,750
你不怕死吗
You do not fear death?

49
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,500
我不汲汲于活命
I do not cling to life.

50
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,850
这两者是有区别的
There is a difference.

51
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,470
带他下去
Remove him.

52
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,990
这名摔跤手名为黑原野猪
This wrestler is named Black Steppe Boar.

53
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,580
是我们在赛西亚俘虏的一名囚犯
A prisoner captured in Scythia.

54
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,210
你知道他为什么会叫野猪吗
Do you know why he is named after the boar?

55
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,830
因为他的长相很奇特
His resemblance is extraordinary.

56
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,720
他被称作野猪
He is called Boar

57
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,220
是因为他多次赤手空拳屠杀他人
because he has killed such without a weapon many times.

58
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,100
野猪会冲上来  抓住你
Boar will advance. He will seize you.

59
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,990
你就会展示出你是如何脱出他的掌控的
You will demonstrate how to break the grasp.

60
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,180
你要蒙上我的眼睛吗
You cover my eyes?

61
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,030
这公平吗
Is that just?

62
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,520
大汗想知道你蒙眼之下是如何作战的
The Great Khan wants a report on how you fight blindfolded.

63
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,240
他真是任性妄为 愚蠢之极
He is a most capricious fool.

64
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,990
你要是够胆子的话  就把我的原话传达给他
And if you were not cowards, you would tell him the same.

65
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,230
闭嘴  道士
Quiet, monk!

66
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,260
你刚才杀死的将军是速不台的儿子
The general you killed was the son of Subutai.

67
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,570
你听过这个名字吗  道士
Do you know that name, monk?

68
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,930
没有
I do not.

69
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,290
他是成吉思汗手下第一悍将
Greatest military commander ever to serve Genghis Khan.

70
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,470
你杀死了他的儿子
You slayed his son.

71
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,360
这是重罪
This is a crime beyond crimes.

72
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,840
但是
Yet...

73
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,770
你说你不汲汲于活命
you do not cling to life, as you say.

74
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,840
死亡并无意义
Death means nothing.

75
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,580
那可汗该怎么办呢
What is a Khan to do?

76
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,010
曾经有个商人送了我一只小亚亚美尼亚的白鹤
A merchant once gifted me a white crane from Lesser Armenia...

77
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,880
那是一种十分稀罕的水鸟
a water bird that was most uncommon...

78
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,130
因为它一生下来就全身漆黑
because it had been born all black.

79
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,020
一只黑色的白鹤
Black white crane.

80
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,250
我知道这是一种吉兆
I knew it was an auspicious

81
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,860
它能给我带来好运  但是
being that would bring me fortune, but...

82
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,770
那只黑色的白鹤不愿待在我的湖泊里
that black white crane refused to stay on my lake.

83
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,010
它总是妄图飞走
Always, it would fly away.

84
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,190
它的本性在召唤它
Just its natural calling, you see.

85
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,750
然后
So...

86
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,700
为了让它给我带来好运
I served him and my fortune...

87
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,190
我断了它一只翅膀
by cutting one wing.

88
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,950
众王之王
"By law of the Grand Khan,

89
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,900
大汗有旨
Lord of Lords..."

90
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,740
你觉得我为什么让你蒙眼战斗
Why do you think I had you fight blindfolded?

91
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,350
因为我任性妄为 愚蠢之极吗
Because I'm a capricious fool?

92
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,700
还是想看看你在黑暗中
Or to see if you are capable

93
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,880
能不能使出你那些道教秘术呢
of your Taoist secrets and skills while in the dark?

94
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,030
钦此
"So be it."

95
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,150
我一看到你就知道
Because I knew the moment you were presented,

96
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,560
你不是那种顺从的画家
you would not be like the obedient painter...

97
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,040
听天由命的占星家  有酒万事足的诗人
the resigned astrologer, the noble poet contented with wine.

98
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,200
你不会原意顺从蒙古帝国
You would refuse to serve the Mongol Empire.

99
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,160
直到今日
To this day...

100
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,840
那只黑色的白鹤还在我的湖上
that black white crane remains on my lake.

101
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,540
它是我的
He is mine...

102
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,460
心爱之物
and he is beloved.

103
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,640
你现在准备好...
Are you now ready...

104
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,390
教授我的军政大臣了吗
to teach my Ministers of Warfare?

105
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,880
给道士上茶
Tea for the monk.

106
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,610
我不是和尚  不要给我茶
Do not confuse me with one of your holy Buddhists.

107
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,490
给我酒
Wine.

108
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,540
你之前是因杀害速不台的儿子受罚
You were punished for killing the son of Subutai.

109
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,540
不要忘记这点
Never forget that.

110
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,260
我不会忘的
I shall not.

111
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,460
武当派的道士们穷尽一生
The monks of Wudang spend their lives

112
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,000
想达到真正的空性
trying to achieve true emptiness.

113
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,830
圣人只有克服自我
For only when the sage can overcome the self

114
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,040
才能领悟道的真意
does he enter into the Tao.

115
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,520
这是众谜之外的黑暗之谜
That is a dark mystery beyond all mysteries,

116
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,000
是你赠给我的礼物
and a gift you gave to me.

117
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,490
我虽瞎
Blind?

118
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,230
但却能以百眼看世界
I now see the world with one hundred eyes.

119
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,690
再给他倒酒
Give him more wine.

120
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,490
我刚抓住了你的马
I've just captured your horse.

121
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,610
我知道
I know.

122
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,780
我告诉你
Then know this.

123
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,810
武当山上
There are four Taoist temples

124
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,370
还有四座道观
still standing in the Wudang Mountains.

125
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,200
我的人半月后会到那里把它们都烧成灰
My men will go there in a fortnight and burn them to the ground.

126
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,950
只需我一声令下
At my single command,

127
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,940
你信仰的宗教就会从世界上消失
your religion can be wiped off the face of this earth.

128
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,900
或者  它可以继续存在下去
Or it can live...

129
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,830
发展
grow...

130
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,410
壮大
thrive...

131
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,340
前提是你向我证明它的价值
if you prove its value to me.

132
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,240
通过训练你的大臣吗
By training your ministers?

133
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,980
还有一个人
And someone else.

134
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,280
你一定就是王子了吧
You must be the prince.

135
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,260
我叫阿尔泰
I am called Altai.

136
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,850
你来这里做什么
Why are you here?

137
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,920
上课
Lessons.

138
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,030
你想通过这些...课程
And what do you intend to teach me

139
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,240
让我学到什么
in these... lessons?

140
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,710
我想让你知道  即使是大汗的儿子
I'm here to teach you that even the son of a royal khan

141
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,410
也知谦恭  知学习

142
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,650
那就拿起扫帚扫地  阿尔泰
Then take the broom, Altai, and sweep my floor.

143
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,370
回答得好  如果你相信的话
Good answer. If only you believed it.

144
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,130
你是世界大花园里的一株小草
You are a little nomad weed in the garden of the world.

145
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,830
他们想让你长成参天大树
They wish you to grow into a flowering tree.

146
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,900
这棵树上最重要的部分是什么
What is the most important part of such a tree?

147
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,620
树枝  还有树上的花
The many branches and the flowering.

148
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,700
我指的是遗产
I speak of legacy.

149
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,240
谢谢你跟我解释你晦涩的比喻
Thank you for untangling your elusive metaphor.

150
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,410
我们从根基开始练起
We begin with roots.

151
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,390
我能问一个问题吗
May I ask a question?

152
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,410
说
Do.

153
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,380
如果你想在墙上写字
If you wish calligraphy on your wall,

154
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,970
为什么不找个眼不瞎的书法家来
why not summon a painter who can see?

155
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,330
你没看到我写的是什么吗
Can you not read the character I made?

156
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,710
它代表的是火
It is a symbol for fire.

157
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,120
有何异常
Then what is wrong?

158
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,600
-倒置了  -没错
- It's upside down. - Precisely.

159
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:52,670
这在功夫世界中代表的是耐心  自控
This is the kung fu character for patience, control.

160
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,590
你要永远记住

绝不让愤怒打败你

162
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,160
师父
Sifu?

163
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,210
我没教过你要保持安静吗
Have I not trained you into exhausted silence yet?

164
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,010
今天的课上完了  王子殿下
Today's lesson is done, My Radiant Highness.

165
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,430
我知道你看不到  但是...
You cannot see it, I know. But...

166
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,280
我向你保证  这是由一位
I assure you it has been overseen

167
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,430
伟大的汉族建筑师
by a great Chinese architect...

168
00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:00,240
用最珍贵的木材和皮草建起来的...
made from the most precious of woods and hides, and--

169
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,480
大胆
imbecile.

170
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,450
有人把汉字"火"倒写在这里了
Someone has painted the character of fire upside down.

171
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,200
是我写的
I did.

172
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,690
值此新春佳节之际
On this day of the New Year...

173
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,230
我将此处命名为四宝之厅
I ordain this place the Hall of the Fourth Treasure.

174
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,890
给你赐名百眼
I name you Hundred Eyes...

175
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,140
军事大臣
...Minister of Martial Affairs.

176
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,580
所以
And so...

177
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,440
我请你这位武当道士
I ask of you, as a Wudang priest,

178
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,980
给我儿子取一个汉族名字
give my son his Chinese name.

179
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,550
从古至今
There have been 500 over time

180
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,290
已有500多位皇帝统治过中国
who have held the name Emperor of All China,

181
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,860
他们自称为天子
Son of Heaven.

182
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,620
虽凭血缘继承王位
Ordained by blood,

183
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,090
但其实与统治世界上
there are those who would have been

184
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,590
最伟大的帝国相比
better suited to harvest cow dung

185
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,650
有的人可能更适合去捡牛粪
than to rule the greatest empire on earth.

186
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,360
有人就如银子
There are those who were as silver,

187
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,540
虽不是坚硬无比  但值得铸币
a lesser metal, but worthy of coinage.

188
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,340
还有人...
And then there are those...

189
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,610
如冰冷的石头
like cold stone,

190
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,840
全靠蛮力和愤怒
who force their strength and fury

191
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,250
通过威吓他人赢得皇位
and win the title by fear and intimidation.

192
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,810
血缘无关紧要
Blood is nothing.

193
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,860
想成为圣贤  靠的是心灵和精神
Heart and spirit make the sage.

194
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,400
因此
And by this...

195
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,450
我给他取名为真金
I give this boy the name Jingim.

196
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,360
"真正的金子"
"True gold."

197
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,450
那就这样吧
So be it.

198
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,410
他以后就用这个名字了
He will walk out of here with this name,

199
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,770
这个名字将伴随他到达圣贤可见的明天
and carry it as his own into a tomorrow only the oracles can see.

200
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,000
至于你  道士
As for you, priest...

201
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,410
这座道观归你了
this temple is yours.

206


207

208

209


210

211


212


217
