1
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,950
I saw you walking.
May I drop you somewhere?

2
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,648
No, thanks.
I'm strolling.

3
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,555
Hey! This is Africa!
It's too hot to stroll.

4
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,287
Hop in.
I'll drive you.

5
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,729
Hello.

6
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,663
That's my son.

7
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,843
Where are you headed?

8
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,607
To Limbe.

9
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,942
You're a tourist?

10
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,350
Sort of.

11
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,322
Where can I drop you?

12
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,381
The bus station, please.

13
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,326
Are you broke?

14
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,592
No, but I don't feel
like taking a taxi.

15
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,861
Going native, huh?

16
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,800
Are you from Limbe?

17
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,564
No.

18
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,052
Thanks, again.

19
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,916
Are you going to Douala?

20
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,943
The next bus leaves
in an hour.

21
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,451
What a drag! Come on,
I'm going to Douala, too.

22
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,702
What's your name?

23
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,729
France.

24
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,777
"Vive la France!"

25
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,500
France!

26
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,662
Next year,
I'll widen this road.

27
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,193
France, stay close by.

28
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,732
Here's my riddle.

29
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,140
Yes.

30
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,237
"At the edge of the road,
a black thread."

31
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,838
"A lively ant."

32
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:51,046
What's worse, this crate
has no brakes left!

33
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,318
You're going to kill us!

34
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,414
It's only a question
of safety, darling.

35
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:00,186
Slowing down would surely
cause an accident.

36
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,659
Look! No feet! Isn't it...

37
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,252
Marc, please!

38
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
That's how it is!

39
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,028
We're going.

40
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,806
Everything's ready, gov'nor.

41
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:57,831
Fine.

42
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,240
Baby ant...

43
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,512
I'll see you in ten days.
Remember, write to grandma.

44
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,248
Yes.

45
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,382
Marc, should I order
these books from Paris?

46
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,017
Fasten the donkey's strap.

47
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,186
Done.

48
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,594
Last time we lost
half the coffee rations.

49
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,288
You were saying?

50
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,197
Never mind.

51
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,225
No kiss?

52
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,070
You'll do fine without me,
Madame governor.

53
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,114
Remember to visit
the Norwegians.

54
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,986
Thanks, Protée, I entrust them
to you. Take good care of them.

55
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,198
You can serve coffee now.

56
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,210
Then it's time for a nap.

57
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,784
You're not in bed?

58
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,184
You'll see,
you'll turn black,

59
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,089
and your father
will scream!

60
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,508
"Ru...

61
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,215
"...dolf

62
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,690
"dieneck."

63
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,459
"Kur Wess."

64
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,500
Kurt Weiss.

65
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,728
Kurt Weiss.

66
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,327
Weiss.

67
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,607
Did the Germans lose the war
in France, too?

68
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,837
Oh, yes, everywhere.

69
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,081
Do you think
we'll be buried here?

70
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,490
Would you like
a citronells, Madame?

71
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,688
No, thank you, Protée.

72
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,753
I'm trying to turn in.
Turn off the lights.

73
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,065
Good night.

74
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,867
Good night, Madame.

75
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,196
Listen, Dieudonné...

76
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,259
if the king had given me...
no, wait.

77
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,363
If the king had...

78
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,468
if the king had given me
Paris, his great city

79
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:38,245
but without my luv
with me

80
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,583
I would tell king Henri,
take back your Paris

81
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:47,149
my luv means
far more to me, oh, yes

82
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,716
what does "my luv" mean?

83
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,228
"My luv" is my love.

84
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,595
"...and the money
for aunt Minni.

85
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,402
"I won't forget to send you
3,000 francs soon.

86
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,567
"For Citabella's wedding.

87
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,769
"I'm expecting a letter
from you...

88
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,337
"but as they say,
no news is good news.

89
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,249
"Dear parents, I wish you
a long and healthy life.

90
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,585
"God bless you.
Your devoted son."

91
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,683
Protée, hurry up.
We must get back!

92
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,833
Protée must get back!

93
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,814
Must get back!
Must get back!

94
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,876
As you wish, ma'am gov'nor.

95
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,660
For whom is that letter?

96
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,358
For my fiancée.

97
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,967
It's hot.

98
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,244
Did you spice it?

99
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,680
Eat.

100
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,773
Come quickly.

101
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,528
Is it the hyena?

102
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,903
Yes.

103
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,066
I think so.

104
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,413
Don't move.

105
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,941
Don't be afraid.

106
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,556
Protée!

107
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,604
Stay here, I'll be back.

108
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,115
Shit!

109
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,656
Protée!

110
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,996
I'm here, Madame.

111
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,172
Where have you been?
I've called you for an hour!

112
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,403
Didn't you hear the hyena?
Come on!

113
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,945
Come on in!

114
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,417
It should be here...

115
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,234
I'm sure Marc keeps it here.

116
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,610
Here.

117
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,979
What about the bullets, Madame?

118
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,010
Where are you going?

119
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,523
I'll check around
the house, Madame.

120
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,992
No!

121
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,790
No, stay with me.

122
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,530
Settle down here.

123
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,841
That awful beast
could come in here any time.

124
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,900
Go to sleep now.

125
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,222
Good night, Madame.

126
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,957
Thank you, Protée.

127
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,337
What's he saying?

128
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:19,571
For two months, lions
have been attacking herds.

129
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:24,177
Tell him I'll organize beats.

130
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,713
He says white men's beats
are bad.

131
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,239
Man must hunt the lion
with a knife...

132
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,048
and with arrows, freeboy.

133
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,419
Thank you for coming.

134
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,291
First the panthers,
then the hyenas.

135
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,489
You really attract
trouble, Nansen.

136
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,030
They've got a soft spot
for you.

137
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,865
It's god's will, isn't it?

138
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,133
Maybe, but I brought you food.

139
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,938
Thank you very much.
Come, have some tea.

140
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,442
Hello, Martha.
Are you well?

141
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,399
Really, Nansen, I don't know
what keeps you here!

142
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:35,839
Look at your wife! She's at
her wits' end! Time to leave!

143
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:40,106
I must evangelize the natives.
I'm a soldier of god.

144
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,308
Everything is fine!

145
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,511
You are totally zany, Nansen!

146
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,021
France! Protée!
We're leaving.

147
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,290
Enoch, it's over!

148
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,591
The Yorkshire pudding, custard
cream, boiled meat. Stop!

149
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,891
Enough!

150
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,456
You understand?

151
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,069
Explain it to him, Protée.

152
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:52,343
This book, there must be
hundreds of recipes in it!

153
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,614
I want french cuisine!
Variety!

154
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,951
Pies, salads...
do you understand?

155
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,956
Madame, Enoch can't read.

156
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,935
You're joking! He's always
got his nose in his book!

157
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,181
He's going to
drive me crazy!

158
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,208
What's wrong with him?

159
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,018
He doesn't want
to cook anymore.

160
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,546
You say he's a bad chef.

161
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,617
And you always yell at him
like his first wife.

162
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,620
As soon as the master is away,
you all take advantage.

163
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,776
I'm fed up!

164
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,019
Push all this out,
all right, Robespierre?

165
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,491
Not the tomatoes, Madame?

166
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,495
Not the tomatoes,
just the weeds!

167
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,554
Mommy!

168
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,293
We have visitors!

169
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,629
Ma'am gov'nor!
Ma'am gov'nor!

170
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,675
There's people arriving!
Many of them!

171
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,646
Come on over there!
They're there!

172
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,199
Jonathan Boothby!

173
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,700
Enoch.

174
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,404
It's tonight or never,
very English!

175
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,355
Perfect, or... or...

176
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,829
Enoch, I don't understand
any of what you're saying.

177
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,443
France!

178
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,592
Hurry up!

179
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,508
Don't forget the port.
I'll take care of the wine.

180
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,243
And... what else?

181
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,251
Oh, yes! Red sash, and take
your shower in the last minute.

182
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,424
Yes?

183
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,859
The Englishman
is wearing his tuxedo.

184
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,333
Oh, no!

185
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,212
Give this to Marie-jeanne.
A touch with the iron will do.

186
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,780
Madame, shall I serve
the drinks?

187
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,152
Wait, come in.

188
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,656
Come closer.

189
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,732
Help me, Protée, would you?

190
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,568
Help me.

191
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,551
You're crazy, Jonathan!

192
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,596
I had no idea.

193
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:21,503
Opportunities for dancing
are rare here, you know.

194
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,768
Solitude, Aimée.

195
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:31,906
Me? The only time I'm alone
is in the shower.

196
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,424
Look, Jonathan.

197
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,800
"This house is
the last house on earth."

198
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,829
The German official
who inscribed this phrase...

199
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,363
is buried here.

200
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,839
Marc is a dreamer,
you know.

201
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:17,717
Does he still keep
his bloody bororo diaries?

202
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,821
Marc and his notebook!

203
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,394
They say this official was
killed by one of his "boys."

204
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:42,842
Last time I visited here,
you were away.

205
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:48,722
We spoke and spoke,
and we drank.

206
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,751
And toward morning...

207
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,889
...you understand?

208
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,923
So close,
that we slept together.

209
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,460
...felt bizarre...

210
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,031
because I have that same feeling
with you, Aimée.

211
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,134
I think there's a...

212
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,575
spell on this house.

213
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,013
You're tipsy, Jonathan.

214
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,516
Tipsy.

215
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,984
I think that's the best.

216
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,387
I'm leaving tomorrow
at dawn.

217
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,403
The queen of England
is ugly.

218
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:17,005
If he has a hairy back,
he has a hairy bottom.

219
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,090
Your Englishman is more
handsome when he's dressed.

220
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,000
He's not my Englishman!

221
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:44,064
Did you see his legs, honey?
They're like twigs!

222
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,008
I'm sleepy.

223
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,167
Is that you, Protée?

224
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,694
I'm waiting to turn off
the generator, Madame.

225
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,616
The ticks will eat your feet!

226
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,803
Here's my riddle.

227
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,609
Yes.

228
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,549
"A charming young girl...

229
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:06,079
"weaves children
around her neck."

230
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,920
The papaya tree!

231
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,099
Where are they going?

232
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,590
Toward the Benoué.

233
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,967
Did you see other herds?
Many?

234
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,939
Yes, they'll all
come from the north.

235
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,931
They're certainly heading
for the Benoué.

236
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,605
Any sick livestock?

237
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,582
No, none, governor.

238
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,353
Do your work!

239
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,072
What are you doing here?

240
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,342
I made the bed.
Now I'm tidying up.

241
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,826
I forbid you to
fiddle with my belongings.

242
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:58,995
I don't want anyone
nosing around my bedroom.

243
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,765
Get out.

244
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,805
Protée.

245
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:15,012
Bring me some water, please.
I feel like taking a shower.

246
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,047
Mommy, let's go home.

247
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,446
Why do you go
to the cemetery?

248
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:03,426
Because I like it.
It's a quiet place.

249
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,790
Hurry up.

250
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:40,060
I'm coming, Etienne.
Forgive me.

251
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,946
Aimée! France!

252
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,477
Good morning, sir.

253
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,889
Is everything
all right, Protée?

254
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,121
Madame is in her bedroom, sir.

255
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,155
Aimée?

256
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,463
Aimée, are you ill?

257
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,542
You're not disappointed
to see your freeboy, honey?

258
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,048
Silly.

259
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:39,320
You frightened me.
I only expected you tomorrow.

260
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,347
I'm filthy.

261
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,103
I'm hungry.

262
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:16,980
Here.

263
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,454
You disgust me.

264
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,184
Dirty nigger.

265
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,435
It's too late.
The meat is overcooked now.

266
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,102
Hair?

267
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,172
Head?

268
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,181
Forehead?

269
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:49,750
Eyes?

270
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,784
Nose?

271
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,986
Mouth?

272
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,659
Teeth?

273
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,595
Tummy?

274
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,025
Chest?

275
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,538
It fell behind
the mountain.

276
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,666
That's enough now,
baby ant.

277
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,578
Planes don't fall.
They go beyond the horizon.

278
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,103
What's the horizon?

279
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,673
Go to sleep now.
I'll explain it tomorrow.

280
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,104
The plane fell
into the mountain.

281
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,555
My dear compatriot...

282
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,653
please forgive this arrival,
so full of fanfare...

283
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:17,827
but we swept up everything
we found on the way.

284
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:21,497
Allow me to introduce myself.
Captain Védrine, pilot.

285
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,769
Last night I had to land
somewhere in the mountain.

286
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,141
Mechanical troubles. Absurd!
A propeller bearing broke.

287
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,272
I must confess that without...

288
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,805
the intrepid assistance
of these young boys...

289
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,182
my passengers and I...

290
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,346
would still be lost
somewhere in the bush.

291
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,721
Marc Dalens, district officer.

292
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,694
Not the best circumstances.

293
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,254
You flew over
our house last night?

294
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:48,662
Affirmative.

295
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,598
Courbassol, my navigator
and associate.

296
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,693
Glad to meet you.
Anyone hurt?

297
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:53,828
No, no one.

298
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,203
Allow me to present
my unfortunate passengers.

299
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,870
Machinard, a colleague of yours,
I believe, and his wife.

300
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,744
Machinard,
what brings you here?

301
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,616
I'm replacing bonaventure
in M'banga.

302
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:12,918
We came from Fort Lamy.
I wanted to make a small detour.

303
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:16,517
It's Mireille's first trip.
She's discovering Africa.

304
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,188
We just got married.

305
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,457
We're on our honeymoon.

306
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,400
Congratulations!
Welcome to north Cameroon.

307
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,837
Make yourselves at home.
We'll take care of everything.

308
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:31,965
You'll see, M'banga
is different, greener.

309
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:38,474
Here comes Delpich,
our charming planter.

310
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:43,350
Delpich, we thought
we'd lost you on the way!

311
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,446
Leave me alone, Védrine!

312
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:50,391
I'm losing money here
every single minute!

313
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:54,227
You should be in a nut house,
not flying a damn bird!

314
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:58,699
Delpich, Joseph,
coffee grower.

315
00:53:58,768 --> 00:53:59,996
Marc Dalens.

316
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,869
Cut the ceremonies,
just get me out of here.

317
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,000
I'll radio Douala and Vaounde.
We'll find a way.

318
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:10,479
My wife will settle you in our
house. You're in good hands.

319
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,878
Where did I fall, anyway?

320
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,883
Mindif, in the Diamaré region.

321
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,850
30 kilometers south-east
of Maroua.

322
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:21,016
Mindif?
Védrine, tell me I'm dreaming!

323
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:26,993
Getting spare parts
could take weeks, you know.

324
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,998
I'm afraid so.

325
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,760
I'm starving.

326
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,806
Wait, Dalens.
That's Thérése, my housekeeper.

327
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,839
She's a bit shy.

328
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,460
Did you turn the mattresses
before making the beds?

329
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,631
Yes, Madame.

330
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:15,402
They're stuck for a month.
A runway must be built.

331
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,517
France, stay out of the way.

332
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,075
Hello, Djatao.
How are you?

333
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,920
Your husband claimed there's
not a single jalopy available!

334
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:37,654
Please accept this gift for
your guests from the airplane.

335
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,991
Is this taxi yours?

336
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,623
Delpich, please meet
our dear friend Wadjirt Djatao.

337
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:47,068
Mr. Delpich is a coffee planter.
In the south, correct?

338
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,628
Yeah. How much for driving me
to Yaoundé?

339
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:55,109
Would you join us
for lunch, Djatao?

340
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,876
No, thank you, Aimée.
It's Ramadan.

341
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,849
Fine. Just name your price.

342
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,181
Good-bye, Aimée.

343
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:05,654
Thank you for your kindness,
Djatao. It's superb!

344
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,883
Thank you.

345
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,185
I got it.

346
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,024
Here.

347
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,562
This is my last offer.

348
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:23,896
How much?

349
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,703
How much?
Fuck it!

350
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,950
Do they run things
around here?

351
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,134
Protée, take the goat away.

352
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,227
Yes, Madame.

353
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,909
In 10 days you'll be
at your post, Machinard.

354
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,069
You think so?

355
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,738
Yes, Marc received a cable.

356
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,641
Protée, you can serve coffee.

357
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,153
M'banga...

358
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:13,917
you're lucky!

359
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,787
See, Mereille? I told you.

360
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:22,560
A nice little spot, M'banga.

361
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,067
It's a bit humid, I hear.

362
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,600
It's like having
cotton balls...

363
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,573
stuffed in your lungs
and nostrils all day.

364
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,940
Actually, I like the forest.

365
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:37,504
The rot smell is so strong
it's like a drug.

366
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:42,644
What's worse are
the little crawlers.

367
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,314
They hide under the bed,
swarm in wash basins.

368
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,320
They even stick inside
your shoes.

369
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,983
The thought of lifting
the mosquito net is nauseating.

370
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,861
Gentlemen, you make it
seem worse than it is.

371
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,765
That's not all!
Mosquitoes, ok.

372
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,825
Less than month ago...

373
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,997
a whole family of settlers
was found cut into slices.

374
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,531
Delpich, please,
you're exaggerating!

375
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,340
Their heads were in
geranium pots on the veranda.

376
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,946
All this just 10 kilometers
from M'banga.

377
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,710
A festering center
of revolt.

378
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,050
And whose fault,
I ask you.

379
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,921
I never sleep without
my piece under the pillow.

380
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:26,152
Protée!

381
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:33,930
Take these men to the kitchen.
They were on the road all day.

382
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,707
I have good news for you.

383
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,651
Our friend, Randall, is coming
to help, with 20 men.

384
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,205
Sir?

385
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,909
Mind your own business.

386
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,747
That's nice.

387
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,390
Not in bed yet, doll?

388
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,158
Isn't she cute?

389
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,162
Well, I'm going to bed.
Good night.

390
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,988
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

391
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,712
What's wrong with you,
Védrine?

392
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:29,047
Don't worry. A minor attack
of marsh fever. I'm used to it.

393
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:17,066
Look there... where I'm
pointing my finger.

394
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,795
See that dust?

395
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,962
It's Randall.

396
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,368
Glad to see you.

397
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,345
I'll bet you are.

398
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,745
Monique.

399
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,249
Here's the most beautiful!

400
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,274
How are you?

401
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,115
And little Paul?

402
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,421
He's wearing me out.

403
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,363
Go over there.

404
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,370
Wait, Segalen.

405
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,808
I'll make the introductions.

406
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:02,037
Marc Dalens.

407
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,205
Hello.

408
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,943
Courbassol, co-pilot.

409
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,281
My wife Aimée.

410
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,083
Excuse me,
I'll join the others.

411
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,022
He's a little... strange.

412
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,791
Tell me how it happened.

413
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,470
Right now road work
is slow. It's Ramadan.

414
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,405
I'll try to get you
transportation home.

415
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,260
Where did you find
your Segalen?

416
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:56,094
He's an ex-seminarian.
I don't know much about him.

417
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,963
One day, he showed up.

418
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,025
What's he doing in Africa?

419
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:04,096
Who knows? He says
he's crossing Africa on foot.

420
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,438
Monique thinks he's a saint.

421
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:26,554
You don't belong here, Segalen.

422
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:30,362
Come to my house in Mindif.
You're more than welcome.

423
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:44,040
Tony adores him.
Luc is wonderful with Paul.

424
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,379
He's set his mind on
starting him on Latin.

425
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,678
Really?

426
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,616
Really, Paul is talented.

427
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,092
He's handsome.

428
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,154
Who?

429
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,199
Your boy.

430
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,727
People no longer know
how to drink coffee.

431
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,930
They really don't.

432
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:48,574
I always add a few chips
of bitter chocolate...

433
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,102
two or three grains of salt...

434
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,479
and to top it off...

435
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,314
a touch of cinnamon.

436
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:15,529
Disgusting. Makes me
regret I grow it.

437
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:18,301
Should I fix it?

438
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,071
Go ahead.
It'll taste better.

439
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:43,632
I know a church
behind a hamlet

440
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:50,663
where a fine steeple
is reflected in the water

441
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:58,306
in the pure water
of the river

442
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:05,018
it's a joke, Luc.
You left everything at home.

443
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,147
I have all I need.

444
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,281
And your books?

445
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,658
Keep them.

446
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,684
Luc, come home with us.

447
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,296
Kiss little Paul for me.

448
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,132
Bastard.

449
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,332
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

450
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:38,481
I had a premonition.
I told Thérése...

451
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:42,423
"chickadee, pack the suitcase.
Tonight, we'll be far away."

452
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,623
What time is it?

453
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,284
Early.

454
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:02,569
Luc, we have plenty of room.
You can have your own space.

455
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,937
No, thanks, Marc.
I'm really fine here.

456
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:12,943
Try these.
They're for you.

457
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:17,516
Thank you, Protée.
Please bring another cup.

458
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,851
I'll go check
on the runway's progress.

459
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:30,730
Then I have an inheritance
matter to settle in Japat.

460
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,301
Want to come?

461
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,599
Not today, thank you.
May I?

462
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:38,630
If you like. It's just
my notes from when I travel.

463
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,379
Did you see Mr. Luc
this morning?

464
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,609
He's bathing outside, Madame.

465
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,947
What do you mean, outside?

466
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,815
In the boys' area, Madame.

467
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:04,896
I'll do it, Madame.

468
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,698
No, never mind.

469
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:12,469
The sheets and pillow cases
need changing.

470
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,808
All done?

471
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,520
Look! Move over.

472
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:39,228
We need two more meters.
Rip these out and flatten it.

473
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,565
They're madam's flowers.

474
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:42,571
You want to play?

475
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:47,304
Don't argue. It's the only spot
where we can play in the shade.

476
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,707
"Amidst bronzed
black African faces...

477
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:57,776
"the white skin color evokes
something akin to death."

478
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:03,052
"In 1891, I, myself,

479
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,922
"having seen only colored
people for months..."

480
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:09,328
what is it, Protée?

481
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,799
I'm bringing
lemon squash, Madame.

482
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:19,501
"In 1891, I, myself,
having seen only..."

483
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,411
put the tray down, Protée.

484
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,746
"In 1891, I, myself...

485
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:36,747
"having seen only
colored people for months...

486
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,421
"once again saw Europeans
near the Benoué.

487
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,862
"I found white skin unnatural...

488
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,092
"next to the fullness
of black skin."

489
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,897
"Then why blame the natives
for considering the white man...

490
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:55,444
"as something contrary
to nature...

491
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,072
"as a supernatural
or fiendish creature?"

492
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,479
Aim or shoot!

493
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,539
It's a "bird head!"

494
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:35,675
Protée, go and get
the pickup, please.

495
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,583
What are you doing here?
Not in bed?

496
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:46,860
She's swallowing her tongue.

497
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,624
Put a spoon in her mouth.

498
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:51,132
Let's get prosper
from the village.

499
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,600
With a spoon, honey.

500
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,778
He's at the school
with the teacher.

501
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,649
His wife gave me his case.

502
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,387
What do they do at night
at the school?

503
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,691
They're talking, sir.

504
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,664
Yes, I know.

505
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:38,612
Prosper!

506
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,748
Prosper, come quickly!

507
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,220
I need you.
I have your case.

508
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,952
Where's my wife?

509
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:20,955
At Mrs. Machinard's bedside.

510
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:24,447
Prosper, it's the room
on the right. Thank you.

511
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,258
Protée's starting
the generator.

512
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,026
Prosper treated us all.

513
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,061
So we're saved, Dalens.

514
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,096
We're saved.

515
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,178
It isn't possible, Dalens.

516
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,654
Have you no one else
who can treat her?

517
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,520
Are you serious, Machinard?

518
01:14:57,025 --> 01:15:00,051
- I'm leaving, sir.
- I'll walk you.

519
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,097
I wouldn't mind, but my wife
needs a real doctor.

520
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,099
I pity you.

521
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,760
The car's coming
early tomorrow.

522
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,100
You'll be in Yaoundé soon.

523
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,128
Dirty nigger!

524
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,608
You're a doctor?

525
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:18,511
You're not good enough
to wipe a white man's ass.

526
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,242
Well, I understand, Mireille.

527
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:23,716
That's the way
to speak to them.

528
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,743
All right, all right.

529
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:28,017
Leave him alone, Segalen.

530
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:31,082
Oh, I forgot
the loop-the-loop king.

531
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,793
You make me sick.

532
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,096
André, I don't feel well.

533
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,998
One can't say a word

534
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,700
without being accused
of the worst things.

535
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,943
A nice trio, Dalens! You,
your wife, and the parasite.

536
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,345
I'm just discussing!

537
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,609
All right, that's enough.

538
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:01,248
Prosper, yop-la-boom,
he's the man all the ladies seek

539
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:05,659
prosper, yop-la-boom, he's
the king of the street

540
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:33,283
one day, we'll get
kicked out of here.

541
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:14,161
Good luck.

542
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:43,017
This is the boys' shower.

543
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,263
Protée...

544
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:53,769
you're a pain.

545
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:57,933
Aimée, it's the most beautiful
bathroom in the world.

546
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:12,686
In french, most words
ending in "e"

547
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,712
are feminine.

548
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:21,357
However, some masculine words
end in a silent "e."

549
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:44,247
Go ahead, Protée.

550
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:46,846
I don't observe Ramadan.

551
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,050
What's the matter?

552
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:56,156
The boss said to tell you
the truck from Douala is here.

553
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:57,324
It's the propeller.

554
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,430
Let's go.

555
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:06,830
Our dear Dalens can't wait
until we leave.

556
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:10,174
The runway is almost finished...

557
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:11,907
but let me point out...

558
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:14,882
that if the rains are
slightly early this year...

559
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:19,478
we're back to square one
for at least 4 months.

560
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,494
Protée, please bring the fruit.

561
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,981
A half?

562
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,211
Gladly.

563
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:58,223
Listen to the night sounds.
Listen carefully.

564
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,378
It's deadly.

565
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,280
Don't exaggerate.

566
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,373
Aimée...

567
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,311
I've decided not to eat
with your guests anymore.

568
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:33,683
You think I enjoy squatting
between Enoch, who rambles on,

569
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,517
and Protée, who pouts?

570
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,254
Right, Protée?

571
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:01,107
Say it bothers you
that I'm here.

572
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:07,020
No?

573
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,259
Well...

574
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,263
I think he's mute.

575
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,530
Actually, Aimée...

576
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:27,473
you'd like to be in my place,
rubbing against Protée.

577
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,744
Come, I'll make room
for you.

578
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,079
No?

579
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,667
Madame?

580
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,968
Thank you, Protée.
I don't need anything.

581
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,094
Beat it.
Leave me alone.

582
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:39,245
Must I repeat it,
you son of a bitch?

583
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,589
What? You don't like it?

584
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:58,428
Fuck off! Go lick the boots
of your bosses.

585
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,793
You're worse than the priests
who raised you.

586
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:26,278
You still want to know
what the horizon is?

587
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,882
Are you asleep?

588
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,856
When you look
at the hills...

589
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:43,421
beyond the houses
and beyond the trees...

590
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,865
where the earth
touches the sky...

591
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,732
that's the horizon.

592
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:54,435
Tomorrow, in the daytime,
I'll show you something.

593
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:04,215
The closer you get to that line,
the farther it moves.

594
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:11,884
If you walk towards it,
it moves away.

595
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:13,723
It flees from you.

596
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,793
I must also explain
this to you.

597
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,001
You see the line.

598
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:29,637
You see it,
but it doesn't exist.

599
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:46,860
Do you want some chocolate?

600
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:50,330
No, too early.

601
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,444
Thank you, Protée.

602
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:23,321
You're here.

603
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:28,431
Luc left?

604
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,066
Yes?

605
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,702
Yes, he left.

606
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:41,472
Without saying anything?

607
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,409
Why didn't you wake me up?

608
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,449
You always get taken in, Marc.

609
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:58,889
I'd rather Protée
stopped working in the house.

610
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:03,529
Put him where you like...
somewhere else.

611
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:06,437
Protée's very good.

612
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:08,909
Please, Marc.

613
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:16,943
He'll work in the garage.

614
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:02,942
Does it burn?

615
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:58,668
Aimée.

616
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:00,640
Have a good trip.

617
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:01,903
Thank you.

618
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:05,278
Good-bye, Dalens.

619
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:35,806
No, it'll never fit.
See the size of my door?

620
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:39,006
Let's go. All aboard.
Forget the organ.

621
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:42,675
You two. Move this thing.
It's in the way.

622
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:44,014
Let's go!

623
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:54,017
I'll come back.

624
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:43,003
My son's name is Sawa.
His mother's a Sawa.

625
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:44,800
I'm Mungo.

626
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,172
Mungo is a nickname
they gave me here.

627
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:52,737
My real name
is William J. Park.

628
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:55,248
I'm an American Negro.

629
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,482
You're not disappointed?

630
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,955
Were you looking
for a real native?

631
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:10,123
Your son's asleep. He'd be
more comfortable in the back.

632
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:11,461
Do you mind?

633
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:14,457
I want a Fanta.

634
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:17,471
Ok, man,
we'll stop for one.

635
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:24,935
I remember the day
I arrived in Africa.

636
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:27,345
I was totally drunk.

637
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:34,014
In customs, I felt like kissing
the officers, my brothers.

638
01:36:35,022 --> 01:36:37,115
I told myself...

639
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:40,525
"that's it, man, you're home."

640
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:45,488
I kept my sweater on.

641
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:50,300
I didn't even realize
I was dripping with sweat.

642
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:57,200
I got ripped off at the airport
by the first cabbie.

643
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:03,483
He didn't give a damn
that I was black.

644
01:37:05,085 --> 01:37:08,248
He was probably right.

645
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:11,281
Brothers here, brothers there.

646
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:16,428
Yeah...

647
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:20,365
I really stayed American.

648
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:26,133
They don't give a shit
about guys like me here.

649
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:29,139
Here, I'm nothing.

650
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:32,136
I'm dreaming.

651
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:37,048
If I died now,
I'd disappear totally.

652
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:42,052
You don't say much.

653
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:45,852
I've hung around Douala
for two weeks.

654
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:49,488
I should be heading north.
I have my ticket.

655
01:37:50,564 --> 01:37:52,589
You know people there?

656
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:54,863
No.

657
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:57,632
There's a house
I'd like to see again...

658
01:37:57,671 --> 01:37:59,400
but I don't know.

659
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:14,353
I'll come back
around 10:00?

660
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:15,946
Suit yourself.

661
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:34,339
That's my wife. Now I live
alone. I was a big pain.

662
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:41,074
Where to?

663
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,345
To the Novotel, please.

664
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:50,985
Thank you.

665
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:54,586
Give me your hand.

666
01:38:54,628 --> 01:38:58,530
I'll tell you if you should
go see your house.

667
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,400
Your palm is strange.
Can't see anything.

668
01:39:10,077 --> 01:39:12,136
Let's have a drink.

669
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:19,309
I don't think so, babe.

670
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:24,657
Leave quickly
before they eat you up. Bye.
