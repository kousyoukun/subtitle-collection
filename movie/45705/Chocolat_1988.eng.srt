1
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:56,588
I saw you walking.
May I drop you somewhere?

2
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,216
No, thanks.
I'm strolling.

3
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:01,004
Hey! This is Africa!
It's too hot to stroll.

4
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,624
Hop in.
I'll drive you.

5
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,762
Hello.

6
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:16,453
That's my son.

7
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,461
Where are you headed?

8
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,153
To Limbe.

9
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,270
You're a tourist?

10
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,620
Sort of.

11
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:30,511
Where can I drop you?

12
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,486
The bus station, please.

13
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:34,351
Are you broke?

14
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:38,442
No, but I don't feel
like taking a taxi.

15
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,577
Going native, huh?

16
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,437
Are you from Limbe?

17
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,129
No.

18
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,573
Thanks, again.

19
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,149
Are you going to Douala?

20
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,093
The next bus leaves
in an hour.

21
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,334
What a drag! Come on,
I'm going to Douala, too.

22
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,691
What's your name?

23
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:56,676
France.

24
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,599
"Vive la France!"

25
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,753
France!

26
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:30,597
Next year,
I'll widen this road.

27
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,123
France, stay close by.

28
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:36,838
Here's my riddle.

29
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:39,147
Yes.

30
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:42,118
"At the edge of the road,
a black thread."

31
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,653
"A lively ant."

32
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:17,419
What's worse, this crate
has no brakes left!

33
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:18,639
You're going to kill us!

34
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,567
It's only a question
of safety, darling.

35
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:26,185
Slowing down would surely
cause an accident.

36
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:27,597
Look! No feet! Isn't it...

37
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,125
Marc, please!

38
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,621
That's how it is!

39
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:11,527
We're going.

40
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,028
Everything's ready, gov'nor.

41
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,011
Fine.

42
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:23,239
Baby ant...

43
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:28,295
I'll see you in ten days.
Remember, write to grandma.

44
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:29,960
Yes.

45
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,925
Marc, should I order
these books from Paris?

46
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,493
Fasten the donkey's strap.

47
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:36,614
Done.

48
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:38,923
Last time we lost
half the coffee rations.

49
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,548
You were saying?

50
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,379
Never mind.

51
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:44,324
No kiss?

52
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:49,929
You'll do fine without me,
Madame Governor.

53
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:02,439
Remember to visit
the Norwegians.

54
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:09,989
Thanks, Protée, I entrust them
to you. Take good care of them.

55
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,997
You can serve coffee now.

56
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,763
Then it's time for a nap.

57
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:42,282
You're not in bed?

58
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,584
You'll see,
You'll turn black,

59
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:46,411
and your father
will scream!

60
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:12,707
"Ru...

61
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,303
"...dolf

62
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,677
"Dieneck."

63
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:23,209
"Kur Wess."

64
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,126
Kurt Weiss.

65
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,303
Kurt Weiss.

66
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:29,796
Weiss.

67
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:34,860
Did the Germans lose the war
in France, too?

68
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,039
Oh, yes, everywhere.

69
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,109
Do you think
we'll be buried here?

70
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,133
Would you like
a citronells, madame?

71
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:52,200
No, thank you, Protée.

72
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:54,180
I'm trying to turn in.
Turn off the lights.

73
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,357
Good night.

74
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,962
Good night, madame.

75
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,213
Listen, Dieudonné...

76
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:33,027
If the king had given me...
No, wait.

77
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,045
If the king had...

78
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,900
If the king had given me
Paris, his great city

79
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:45,481
But without my luv
with me

80
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:49,642
I would tell King Henri,
take back your Paris

81
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:54,021
My luv means
far more to me, oh, yes

82
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:55,524
What does "my luv" mean?

83
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,933
"My luv" is my love.

84
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:37,605
"...And the money
for Aunt Minni.

85
00:18:37,646 --> 00:18:40,297
"I won't forget to send you
3,000 francs soon.

86
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,374
"For Citabella's wedding.

87
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,526
"I'm expecting a letter
from you...

88
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,948
"but as they say,
no news is good news.

89
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,700
"Dear parents, I wish you
a long and healthy life.

90
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:54,858
"God bless you.
Your devoted son."

91
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:58,789
Protée, hurry up.
We must get back!

92
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,195
Protée must get back!

93
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,013
Must get back!
Must get back!

94
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,868
As you wish, ma'am Gov'nor.

95
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,251
For whom is that letter?

96
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:35,879
For my fiancée.

97
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,095
It's hot.

98
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,115
Did you spice it?

99
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,246
Eat.

100
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:51,083
Come quickly.

101
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,660
Is it the hyena?

102
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:19,978
Yes.

103
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:21,094
I think so.

104
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:30,058
Don't move.

105
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:31,523
Don't be afraid.

106
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,540
Protée!

107
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,053
Stay here, I'll be back.

108
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,379
Shit!

109
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:15,366
Protée!

110
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:17,610
I'm here, madame.

111
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,533
Where have you been?
I've called you for an hour!

112
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:26,632
Didn't you hear the hyena?
Come on!

113
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:30,988
Come on in!

114
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,072
It should be here...

115
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,241
I'm sure Marc keeps it here.

116
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,315
Here.

117
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,587
What about the bullets, madame?

118
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:10,371
Where are you going?

119
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:12,781
I'll check around
the house, madame.

120
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:15,149
No!

121
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:16,873
No, stay with me.

122
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,419
Settle down here.

123
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:35,144
That awful beast
could come in here any time.

124
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:02,053
Go to sleep now.

125
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,584
Good night, madame.

126
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:22,248
Thank you, Protée.

127
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,892
What's he saying?

128
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:07,912
For two months, lions
have been attacking herds.

129
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,329
Tell him I'll organize beats.

130
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,532
He says white men's beats
are bad.

131
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,955
Man must hunt the lion
with a knife...

132
00:25:45,998 --> 00:25:48,649
and with arrows, freeboy.

133
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:59,014
Thank you for coming.

134
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:00,810
First the panthers,
then the hyenas.

135
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:02,918
You really attract
trouble, Nansen.

136
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:05,355
They've got a soft spot
for you.

137
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,073
It's God's will, isn't it?

138
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,249
Maybe, but I brought you food.

139
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:13,898
Thank you very much.
Come, have some tea.

140
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:23,012
Hello, Martha.
Are you well?

141
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,882
Really, Nansen, I don't know
what keeps you here!

142
00:28:11,918 --> 00:28:16,140
Look at your wife! She's at
her wits' end! Time to leave!

143
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:20,233
I must evangelize the natives.
I'm a soldier of God.

144
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,303
Everything is fine!

145
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:26,375
You are totally zany, Nansen!

146
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:40,291
France! Protée!
We're leaving.

147
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:05,484
Enoch, it's over!

148
00:29:05,518 --> 00:29:09,609
The Yorkshire pudding, custard
cream, boiled meat. Stop!

149
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:10,856
Enough!

150
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:13,315
You understand?

151
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:16,780
Explain it to him, Protée.

152
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:29,511
This book, there must be
hundreds of recipes in it!

153
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:32,648
I want French cuisine!
Variety!

154
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:34,889
Pies, salads...
Do you understand?

155
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,443
Madame, Enoch can't read.

156
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:51,177
You're joking! He's always
got his nose in his book!

157
00:30:07,726 --> 00:30:09,635
He's going to
drive me crazy!

158
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,555
What's wrong with him?

159
00:30:35,597 --> 00:30:39,209
He doesn't want
to cook anymore.

160
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,674
You say he's a bad chef.

161
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:43,620
And you always yell at him
like his first wife.

162
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:47,459
As soon as the master is away,
you all take advantage.

163
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:39,396
I'm fed up!

164
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:45,384
Push all this out,
all right, Robespierre?

165
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:46,795
Not the tomatoes, madame?

166
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:49,676
Not the tomatoes,
just the weeds!

167
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:51,651
Mommy!

168
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:53,319
We have visitors!

169
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:58,436
Ma'am Gov'nor!
Ma'am Gov'nor!

170
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,235
There's people arriving!
Many of them!

171
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,084
Come on over there!
They're there!

172
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:27,754
Jonathan Boothby!

173
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:34,948
Enoch.

174
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,459
It's tonight or never,
very English!

175
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,085
Perfect, or... or...

176
00:32:56,973 --> 00:33:00,007
Enoch, I don't understand
any of what you're saying.

177
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:15,940
France!

178
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:22,796
Hurry up!

179
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:42,856
Don't forget the port.
I'll take care of the wine.

180
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:45,479
And... what else?

181
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:49,322
Oh, yes! Red sash, and take
your shower in the last minute.

182
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,120
Yes?

183
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,414
The Englishman
is wearing his tuxedo.

184
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:02,828
Oh, no!

185
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,179
Give this to Marie-Jeanne.
A touch with the iron will do.

186
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:20,519
Madame, shall I serve
the drinks?

187
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:22,794
Wait, come in.

188
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:29,031
Come closer.

189
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:34,859
Help me, Protée, would you?

190
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:40,456
Help me.

191
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:33,186
You're crazy, Jonathan!

192
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:38,025
I had no idea.

193
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:42,731
Opportunities for dancing
are rare here, you know.

194
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:48,739
Solitude, Aimée.

195
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,708
Me? The only time I'm alone
is in the shower.

196
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:03,754
Look, Jonathan.

197
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:12,746
"This house is
the last house on earth."

198
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,651
The German official
who inscribed this phrase...

199
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:17,122
is buried here.

200
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,333
Marc is a dreamer,
you know.

201
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:36,642
Does he still keep
his bloody Bororo diaries?

202
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:38,660
Marc and his notebook!

203
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:45,923
They say this official was
killed by one of his "boys."

204
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:00,738
Last time I visited here,
you were away.

205
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:06,377
We spoke and spoke,
and we drank.

206
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:09,282
And toward morning...

207
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,333
...you understand?

208
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:14,242
So close,
that we slept together.

209
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,634
...felt bizarre...

210
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:21,059
because I have that same feeling
with you, Aimée.

211
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:23,076
I think there's a...

212
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:26,376
spell on this house.

213
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,714
You're tipsy, Jonathan.

214
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:30,156
Tipsy.

215
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:39,236
I think that's the best.

216
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:43,459
I'm leaving tomorrow
at dawn.

217
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:26,631
The queen of England
is ugly.

218
00:38:26,669 --> 00:38:31,044
If he has a hairy back,
he has a hairy bottom.

219
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:51,266
Your Englishman is more
handsome when he's dressed.

220
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:53,097
He's not my Englishman!

221
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:56,995
Did you see his legs, honey?
They're like twigs!

222
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,777
I'm sleepy.

223
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,988
Is that you, Protée?

224
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:26,370
I'm waiting to turn off
the generator, madame.

225
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:46,435
The ticks will eat your feet!

226
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:04,836
Here's my riddle.

227
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:07,527
Yes.

228
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:10,347
"A charming young girl...

229
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:15,651
"weaves children
around her neck."

230
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,416
The papaya tree!

231
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:24,301
Where are they going?

232
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:26,690
Toward the Benoué.

233
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:28,970
Did you see other herds?
Many?

234
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:30,861
Yes, they'll all
come from the north.

235
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,730
They're certainly heading
for the Benoué.

236
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,172
Any sick livestock?

237
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:41,068
No, none, governor.

238
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:18,251
Do your work!

239
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:40,039
What are you doing here?

240
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:43,175
I made the bed.
Now I'm tidying up.

241
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:59,943
I forbid you to
fiddle with my belongings.

242
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:03,941
I don't want anyone
nosing around my bedroom.

243
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,639
Get out.

244
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:13,350
Protée.

245
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:19,302
Bring me some water, please.
I feel like taking a shower.

246
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,592
Mommy, let's go home.

247
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:58,500
Why do you go
to the cemetery?

248
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:03,276
Because I like it.
It's a quiet place.

249
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,502
Hurry up.

250
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:38,409
I'm coming, Etienne.
Forgive me.

251
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:01,317
Aimée! France!

252
00:45:01,356 --> 00:45:02,785
Good morning, sir.

253
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:06,057
Is everything
all right, Protée?

254
00:45:07,085 --> 00:45:09,157
Madame is in her bedroom, sir.

255
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:12,067
Aimée?

256
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,280
Aimée, are you ill?

257
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:25,864
You're not disappointed
to see your freeboy, honey?

258
00:45:25,901 --> 00:45:28,268
Silly.

259
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:35,242
You frightened me.
I only expected you tomorrow.

260
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:37,186
I'm filthy.

261
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,863
I'm hungry.

262
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:08,902
Here.

263
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,274
You disgust me.

264
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:12,934
Dirty nigger.

265
00:47:21,932 --> 00:47:25,642
It's too late.
The meat is overcooked now.

266
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:32,036
Hair?

267
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:34,021
Head?

268
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:36,907
Forehead?

269
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,330
Eyes?

270
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,198
Nose?

271
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:47,269
Mouth?

272
00:47:48,044 --> 00:47:49,833
Teeth?

273
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:52,648
Tummy?

274
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:55,938
Chest?

275
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,914
It fell behind
the mountain.

276
00:48:31,948 --> 00:48:33,955
That's enough now,
baby ant.

277
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:36,748
Planes don't fall.
They go beyond the horizon.

278
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:39,170
What's the horizon?

279
00:48:39,213 --> 00:48:41,634
Go to sleep now.
I'll explain it tomorrow.

280
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:02,187
The plane fell
into the mountain.

281
00:49:52,204 --> 00:49:54,408
My dear compatriot...

282
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:57,379
Please forgive this arrival,
so full of fanfare...

283
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,341
but we swept up everything
we found on the way.

284
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:05,861
Allow me to introduce myself.
Captain Védrine, pilot.

285
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,999
Last night I had to land
somewhere in the mountain.

286
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:12,233
Mechanical troubles. Absurd!
A propeller bearing broke.

287
00:50:12,268 --> 00:50:15,236
I must confess that without...

288
00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:17,665
the intrepid assistance
of these young boys...

289
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,945
my passengers and I...

290
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,020
would still be lost
somewhere in the bush.

291
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,257
Marc Dalens, District Officer.

292
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,108
Not the best circumstances.

293
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,563
You flew over
our house last night?

294
00:50:30,604 --> 00:50:31,913
Affirmative.

295
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:33,770
Courbassol, my navigator
and associate.

296
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:35,779
Glad to meet you.
Anyone hurt?

297
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,868
No, no one.

298
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:40,104
Allow me to present
my unfortunate passengers.

299
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,580
Machinard, a colleague of yours,
I believe, and his wife.

300
00:50:47,116 --> 00:50:49,255
Machinard,
what brings you here?

301
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:52,009
I'm replacing Bonaventure
in M'Banga.

302
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:55,176
We came from Fort Lamy.
I wanted to make a small detour.

303
00:50:55,212 --> 00:50:58,627
It's Mireille's first trip.
She's discovering Africa.

304
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:01,189
We just got married.

305
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:02,406
We're on our honeymoon.

306
00:51:02,444 --> 00:51:05,228
Congratulations!
Welcome to north Cameroon.

307
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:09,484
Make yourselves at home.
We'll take care of everything.

308
00:51:09,548 --> 00:51:13,443
You'll see, M'Banga
is different, greener.

309
00:51:15,212 --> 00:51:19,685
Here comes Delpich,
our charming planter.

310
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:24,361
Delpich, we thought
we'd lost you on the way!

311
00:51:25,388 --> 00:51:27,330
Leave me alone, Védrine!

312
00:51:27,372 --> 00:51:31,114
I'm losing money here
every single minute!

313
00:51:31,148 --> 00:51:34,793
You should be in a nut house,
not flying a damn bird!

314
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,082
Delpich, Joseph,
coffee grower.

315
00:51:39,148 --> 00:51:40,325
Marc Dalens.

316
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:43,081
Cut the ceremonies,
just get me out of here.

317
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:46,084
I'll radio Douala and Vaounde.
We'll find a way.

318
00:51:46,124 --> 00:51:50,379
My wife will settle you in our
house. You're in good hands.

319
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:52,200
Where did I fall, anyway?

320
00:51:52,236 --> 00:51:54,123
Mindif, in the Diamaré region.

321
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:56,010
30 kilometers south-east
of Maroua.

322
00:51:56,043 --> 00:52:00,964
Mindif?
Védrine, tell me I'm dreaming!

323
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,696
Getting spare parts
could take weeks, you know.

324
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:08,619
I'm afraid so.

325
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,227
I'm starving.

326
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,780
Wait, Dalens.
That's Thérése, my housekeeper.

327
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,729
She's a bit shy.

328
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:46,465
Did you turn the mattresses
before making the beds?

329
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:47,588
Yes, madame.

330
00:52:49,228 --> 00:52:53,122
They're stuck for a month.
A runway must be built.

331
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,987
France, stay out of the way.

332
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,737
Hello, Djatao.
How are you?

333
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,424
Your husband claimed there's
not a single jalopy available!

334
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,005
Please accept this gift for
your guests from the airplane.

335
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:13,288
Is this taxi yours?

336
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:16,771
Delpich, please meet
our dear friend Wadjirt Djatao.

337
00:54:16,811 --> 00:54:21,034
Mr. Delpich is a coffee planter.
In the south, correct?

338
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:23,489
Yeah. How much for driving me
to Yaoundé?

339
00:54:25,484 --> 00:54:28,745
Would you join us
for lunch, Djatao?

340
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:32,358
No, thank you, Aimée.
It's Ramadan.

341
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,250
Fine. Just name your price.

342
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:35,528
Good-bye, Aimée.

343
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,858
Thank you for your kindness,
Djatao. It's superb!

344
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:40,996
Thank you.

345
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:43,204
I got it.

346
00:54:45,675 --> 00:54:46,886
Here.

347
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:52,197
This is my last offer.

348
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:56,353
How much?

349
00:54:57,899 --> 00:55:00,004
How much?
Fuck it!

350
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:08,873
Do they run things
around here?

351
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:24,394
Protée, take the goat away.

352
00:55:24,427 --> 00:55:25,442
Yes, madame.

353
00:55:26,636 --> 00:55:30,891
In 10 days you'll be
at your post, Machinard.

354
00:55:30,924 --> 00:55:32,004
You think so?

355
00:55:32,043 --> 00:55:34,563
Yes, Marc received a cable.

356
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:40,225
Protée, you can serve coffee.

357
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:41,675
M'Banga...

358
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:44,325
you're lucky!

359
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:48,037
See, Mereille? I told you.

360
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:52,614
A nice little spot, M'Banga.

361
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:55,019
It's a bit humid, I hear.

362
00:55:56,684 --> 00:55:58,407
It's like having
cotton balls...

363
00:55:58,443 --> 00:56:01,258
stuffed in your lungs
and nostrils all day.

364
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,528
Actually, I like the forest.

365
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:06,946
The rot smell is so strong
it's like a drug.

366
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:11,876
What's worse are
the little crawlers.

367
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:15,395
They hide under the bed,
swarm in wash basins.

368
00:56:15,596 --> 00:56:17,319
They even stick inside
your shoes.

369
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:20,832
The thought of lifting
the mosquito net is nauseating.

370
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,592
Gentlemen, you make it
seem worse than it is.

371
00:56:23,628 --> 00:56:26,377
That's not all!
Mosquitoes, OK.

372
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,353
Less than month ago...

373
00:56:28,395 --> 00:56:31,395
a whole family of settlers
was found cut into slices.

374
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:34,784
Delpich, please,
you're exaggerating!

375
00:56:34,827 --> 00:56:37,478
Their heads were in
geranium pots on the veranda.

376
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:39,978
All this just 10 kilometers
from M'Banga.

377
00:56:40,011 --> 00:56:41,669
A festering center
of revolt.

378
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:46,791
And whose fault,
I ask you.

379
00:56:46,827 --> 00:56:49,544
I never sleep without
my piece under the pillow.

380
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,602
Protée!

381
00:56:57,035 --> 00:57:01,061
Take these men to the kitchen.
They were on the road all day.

382
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:13,315
I have good news for you.

383
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:17,097
Our friend, Randall, is coming
to help, with 20 men.

384
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:42,564
Sir?

385
00:57:43,531 --> 00:57:45,157
Mind your own business.

386
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:50,756
That's nice.

387
00:57:54,987 --> 00:57:58,086
Not in bed yet, doll?

388
00:57:58,123 --> 00:57:59,781
Isn't she cute?

389
00:58:04,555 --> 00:58:07,457
Well, I'm going to bed.
Good night.

390
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:31,266
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

391
00:58:44,523 --> 00:58:47,305
What's wrong with you,
Védrine?

392
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:51,463
Don't worry. A minor attack
of marsh fever. I'm used to it.

393
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:37,515
Look there... where I'm
pointing my finger.

394
00:59:37,515 --> 00:59:39,173
See that dust?

395
00:59:39,212 --> 00:59:41,251
It's Randall.

396
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:48,354
Glad to see you.

397
00:59:48,395 --> 00:59:50,250
I'll bet you are.

398
00:59:50,283 --> 00:59:52,552
Monique.

399
00:59:52,587 --> 00:59:53,994
Here's the most beautiful!

400
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:55,936
How are you?

401
00:59:59,499 --> 01:00:00,579
And little Paul?

402
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:02,791
He's wearing me out.

403
01:00:07,147 --> 01:00:08,489
Go over there.

404
01:00:12,363 --> 01:00:14,250
Wait, Segalen.

405
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,506
I'll make the introductions.

406
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:20,644
Marc Dalens.

407
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,723
Hello.

408
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:25,349
Courbassol, co-pilot.

409
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:27,591
My wife Aimée.

410
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:31,238
Excuse me,
I'll join the others.

411
01:00:35,275 --> 01:00:36,933
He's a little... strange.

412
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:39,589
Tell me how it happened.

413
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,994
Right now road work
is slow. It's Ramadan.

414
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:48,809
I'll try to get you
transportation home.

415
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:08,810
Where did you find
your Segalen?

416
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:12,487
He's an ex-seminarian.
I don't know much about him.

417
01:01:12,523 --> 01:01:14,279
One day, he showed up.

418
01:01:14,315 --> 01:01:16,257
What's he doing in Africa?

419
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:20,161
Who knows? He says
he's crossing Africa on foot.

420
01:01:20,235 --> 01:01:23,366
Monique thinks he's a saint.

421
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:41,699
You don't belong here, Segalen.

422
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:45,351
Come to my house in Mindif.
You're more than welcome.

423
01:01:53,516 --> 01:01:58,469
Tony adores him.
Luc is wonderful with Paul.

424
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:01,671
He's set his mind on
starting him on Latin.

425
01:02:01,707 --> 01:02:02,917
Really?

426
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:06,694
Really, Paul is talented.

427
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:13,863
He's handsome.

428
01:02:13,899 --> 01:02:15,841
Who?

429
01:02:15,915 --> 01:02:17,802
Your boy.

430
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:50,916
People no longer know
how to drink coffee.

431
01:02:52,395 --> 01:02:53,988
They really don't.

432
01:02:55,275 --> 01:03:00,360
I always add a few chips
of bitter chocolate...

433
01:03:00,395 --> 01:03:02,784
two or three grains of salt...

434
01:03:02,827 --> 01:03:05,064
and to top it off...

435
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:07,783
a touch of cinnamon.

436
01:03:19,915 --> 01:03:26,211
Disgusting. Makes me
regret I grow it.

437
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:28,869
Should I fix it?

438
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:31,526
Go ahead.
It'll taste better.

439
01:03:46,283 --> 01:03:53,162
I know a church
behind a hamlet

440
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:59,905
Where a fine steeple
is reflected in the water

441
01:03:59,947 --> 01:04:07,235
In the pure water
of the river

442
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:13,672
It's a joke, Luc.
You left everything at home.

443
01:04:13,707 --> 01:04:15,714
I have all I need.

444
01:04:15,755 --> 01:04:16,802
And your books?

445
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:18,122
Keep them.

446
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:21,024
Luc, come home with us.

447
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,407
Kiss little Paul for me.

448
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,126
Bastard.

449
01:04:30,699 --> 01:04:33,154
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

450
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:45,765
I had a premonition.
I told Thérése...

451
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:49,545
"Chickadee, pack the suitcase.
Tonight, we'll be far away."

452
01:05:51,627 --> 01:05:53,034
What time is it?

453
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:54,627
Early.

454
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:06,409
Luc, we have plenty of room.
You can have your own space.

455
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:08,680
No, thanks, Marc.
I'm really fine here.

456
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:16,358
Try these.
They're for you.

457
01:06:17,547 --> 01:06:20,743
Thank you, Protée.
Please bring another cup.

458
01:06:27,307 --> 01:06:29,696
I'll go check
on the runway's progress.

459
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:33,416
Then I have an inheritance
matter to settle in Japat.

460
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:34,923
Want to come?

461
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:37,127
Not today, thank you.
May I?

462
01:06:37,163 --> 01:06:40,993
If you like. It's just
my notes from when I travel.

463
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,465
Did you see mr. Luc
this morning?

464
01:06:47,499 --> 01:06:49,604
He's bathing outside, madame.

465
01:06:49,643 --> 01:06:50,887
What do you mean, outside?

466
01:06:50,922 --> 01:06:52,678
In the boys' area, madame.

467
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:06,183
I'll do it, madame.

468
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:08,870
No, never mind.

469
01:07:08,906 --> 01:07:13,445
The sheets and pillow cases
need changing.

470
01:07:16,842 --> 01:07:18,566
All done?

471
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,839
Look! Move over.

472
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:39,108
We need two more meters.
Rip these out and flatten it.

473
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:40,391
They're madam's flowers.

474
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:42,315
You want to play?

475
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:46,854
Don't argue. It's the only spot
where we can play in the shade.

476
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,035
"Amidst bronzed
black African faces...

477
01:07:52,075 --> 01:07:56,897
"the white skin color evokes
something akin to death."

478
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:01,957
"In 1891, I, myself,

479
01:08:02,155 --> 01:08:05,668
"having seen only colored
people for months..."

480
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,976
What is it, Protée?

481
01:08:08,011 --> 01:08:10,345
I'm bringing
lemon squash, madame.

482
01:08:13,738 --> 01:08:17,732
"In 1891, I, myself,
having seen only..."

483
01:08:19,627 --> 01:08:21,482
Put the tray down, Protée.

484
01:08:26,922 --> 01:08:29,475
"In 1891, I, myself...

485
01:08:29,515 --> 01:08:34,271
"having seen only
colored people for months...

486
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:37,795
"once again saw Europeans
near the Benoué.

487
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:40,136
"I found white skin unnatural...

488
01:08:40,202 --> 01:08:42,275
"next to the fullness
of black skin."

489
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:47,842
"Then why blame the natives
for considering the white man...

490
01:08:47,882 --> 01:08:52,203
"as something contrary
to nature...

491
01:08:52,203 --> 01:08:54,723
"as a supernatural
or fiendish creature?"

492
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,745
Aim or shoot!

493
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:27,778
It's a "bird head!"

494
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:30,786
Protée, go and get
the pickup, please.

495
01:09:34,955 --> 01:09:38,370
What are you doing here?
Not in bed?

496
01:09:40,138 --> 01:09:41,513
She's swallowing her tongue.

497
01:09:41,546 --> 01:09:43,204
Put a spoon in her mouth.

498
01:09:43,243 --> 01:09:45,610
Let's get Prosper
from the village.

499
01:09:45,642 --> 01:09:47,977
With a spoon, honey.

500
01:10:03,403 --> 01:10:05,410
He's at the school
with the teacher.

501
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,122
His wife gave me his case.

502
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,748
What do they do at night
at the school?

503
01:10:11,787 --> 01:10:13,958
They're talking, sir.

504
01:10:13,994 --> 01:10:16,809
Yes, I know.

505
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:31,145
Prosper!

506
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,907
Prosper, come quickly!

507
01:10:45,162 --> 01:10:48,032
I need you.
I have your case.

508
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:08,874
Where's my wife?

509
01:11:08,906 --> 01:11:11,754
At Mrs. Machinard's bedside.

510
01:11:11,786 --> 01:11:15,102
Prosper, it's the room
on the right. Thank you.

511
01:11:16,075 --> 01:11:17,798
Protée's starting
the generator.

512
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:25,248
Prosper treated us all.

513
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,200
So we're saved, Dalens.

514
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:29,151
We're saved.

515
01:11:38,218 --> 01:11:40,739
It isn't possible, Dalens.

516
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:43,113
Have you no one else
who can treat her?

517
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:44,903
Are you serious, Machinard?

518
01:11:46,346 --> 01:11:49,248
- I'm leaving, sir.
- I'll walk you.

519
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:52,169
I wouldn't mind, but my wife
needs a real doctor.

520
01:11:52,202 --> 01:11:54,089
I pity you.

521
01:11:54,122 --> 01:11:55,682
The car's coming
early tomorrow.

522
01:11:55,723 --> 01:11:57,926
You'll be in Yaoundé soon.

523
01:11:57,962 --> 01:11:59,871
Dirty nigger!

524
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:03,209
You're a doctor?

525
01:12:03,242 --> 01:12:06,952
You're not good enough
to wipe a white man's ass.

526
01:12:06,987 --> 01:12:08,612
Well, I understand, Mireille.

527
01:12:09,642 --> 01:12:11,944
That's the way
to speak to them.

528
01:12:11,978 --> 01:12:13,888
All right, all right.

529
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,069
Leave him alone, Segalen.

530
01:12:16,106 --> 01:12:19,008
Oh, I forgot
the loop-the-loop king.

531
01:12:20,843 --> 01:12:23,526
You make me sick.

532
01:12:23,563 --> 01:12:26,694
André, I don't feel well.

533
01:12:29,258 --> 01:12:30,436
One can't say a word

534
01:12:30,474 --> 01:12:33,027
without being accused
of the worst things.

535
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,015
A nice trio, Dalens! You,
your wife, and the parasite.

536
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,359
I'm just discussing!

537
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:43,490
All right, that's enough.

538
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:47,938
Prosper, yop-la-boom,
he's the man all the ladies seek

539
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:52,169
Prosper, yop-la-boom, he's
the king of the street

540
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:18,661
One day, we'll get
kicked out of here.

541
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:57,865
Good luck.

542
01:14:23,019 --> 01:14:25,539
This is the boys' shower.

543
01:14:31,178 --> 01:14:33,447
Protée...

544
01:14:33,482 --> 01:14:35,851
you're a pain.

545
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:39,844
Aimée, it's the most beautiful
bathroom in the world.

546
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:53,993
In French, most words
ending in "e"

547
01:14:54,026 --> 01:14:55,936
are feminine.

548
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:02,309
However, some masculine words
end in a silent "e."

549
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:24,261
Go ahead, Protée.

550
01:15:24,298 --> 01:15:26,754
I don't observe Ramadan.

551
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:30,785
What's the matter?

552
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:35,682
The boss said to tell you
the truck from Douala is here.

553
01:15:35,723 --> 01:15:36,802
It's the propeller.

554
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:40,740
Let's go.

555
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,919
Our dear Dalens can't wait
until we leave.

556
01:15:45,962 --> 01:15:49,126
The runway is almost finished...

557
01:15:49,163 --> 01:15:50,788
but let me point out...

558
01:15:50,826 --> 01:15:53,641
that if the rains are
slightly early this year...

559
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:58,049
we're back to square one
for at least 4 months.

560
01:16:03,402 --> 01:16:05,737
Protée, please bring the fruit.

561
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,344
A half?

562
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:27,523
Gladly.

563
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,207
Listen to the night sounds.
Listen carefully.

564
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:53,577
It's deadly.

565
01:16:57,002 --> 01:16:58,279
Don't exaggerate.

566
01:17:52,682 --> 01:17:54,951
Aimée...

567
01:17:55,946 --> 01:17:58,728
I've decided not to eat
with your guests anymore.

568
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:06,757
You think I enjoy squatting
between Enoch, who rambles on,

569
01:18:06,955 --> 01:18:09,475
and Protée, who pouts?

570
01:18:14,026 --> 01:18:15,936
Right, Protée?

571
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,058
Say it bothers you
that I'm here.

572
01:18:36,874 --> 01:18:38,728
No?

573
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,712
Well...

574
01:18:44,746 --> 01:18:46,634
I think he's mute.

575
01:18:51,562 --> 01:18:54,562
Actually, Aimée...

576
01:18:54,602 --> 01:18:58,344
you'd like to be in my place,
rubbing against Protée.

577
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,358
Come, I'll make room
for you.

578
01:19:09,866 --> 01:19:11,392
No?

579
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,424
Madame?

580
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:27,590
Thank you, Protée.
I don't need anything.

581
01:19:54,986 --> 01:19:57,441
Beat it.
Leave me alone.

582
01:20:04,394 --> 01:20:07,176
Must I repeat it,
you son of a bitch?

583
01:20:15,754 --> 01:20:18,055
What? You don't like it?

584
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:25,573
Fuck off! Go lick the boots
of your bosses.

585
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:30,718
You're worse than the priests
who raised you.

586
01:22:44,138 --> 01:22:47,367
You still want to know
what the horizon is?

587
01:22:49,546 --> 01:22:51,783
Are you asleep?

588
01:22:57,258 --> 01:23:00,389
When you look
at the hills...

589
01:23:00,426 --> 01:23:03,808
beyond the houses
and beyond the trees...

590
01:23:03,849 --> 01:23:07,111
where the earth
touches the sky...

591
01:23:07,146 --> 01:23:08,902
that's the horizon.

592
01:23:11,338 --> 01:23:14,371
Tomorrow, in the daytime,
I'll show you something.

593
01:23:20,073 --> 01:23:23,750
The closer you get to that line,
the farther it moves.

594
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:31,105
If you walk towards it,
it moves away.

595
01:23:31,146 --> 01:23:32,869
It flees from you.

596
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:37,731
I must also explain
this to you.

597
01:23:41,514 --> 01:23:43,685
You see the line.

598
01:23:45,578 --> 01:23:48,131
You see it,
but it doesn't exist.

599
01:24:02,761 --> 01:24:04,649
Do you want some chocolate?

600
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:07,976
No, too early.

601
01:24:21,642 --> 01:24:23,430
Thank you, Protée.

602
01:24:38,089 --> 01:24:39,616
You're here.

603
01:24:42,826 --> 01:24:44,517
Luc left?

604
01:24:50,378 --> 01:24:51,839
Yes?

605
01:24:51,881 --> 01:24:53,408
Yes, he left.

606
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:57,024
Without saying anything?

607
01:24:58,857 --> 01:25:00,799
Why didn't you wake me up?

608
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:05,633
You always get taken in, Marc.

609
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,727
I'd rather Protée
stopped working in the house.

610
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:18,177
Put him where you like...
somewhere else.

611
01:25:19,178 --> 01:25:20,966
Protée's very good.

612
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,337
Please, Marc.

613
01:25:29,002 --> 01:25:31,042
He'll work in the garage.

614
01:28:08,169 --> 01:28:10,241
Does it burn?

615
01:29:01,929 --> 01:29:03,685
Aimée.

616
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:05,576
Have a good trip.

617
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:06,787
Thank you.

618
01:29:08,169 --> 01:29:10,024
Good-bye, Dalens.

619
01:29:34,697 --> 01:29:39,302
No, it'll never fit.
See the size of my door?

620
01:29:39,337 --> 01:29:42,371
Let's go. All aboard.
Forget the organ.

621
01:29:42,409 --> 01:29:45,889
You two. Move this thing.
It's in the way.

622
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:47,174
Let's go!

623
01:29:54,857 --> 01:29:56,767
I'll come back.

624
01:31:38,441 --> 01:31:41,289
My son's name is Sawa.
His mother's a Sawa.

625
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:43,012
I'm Mungo.

626
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:46,246
Mungo is a nickname
they gave me here.

627
01:31:46,282 --> 01:31:50,624
My real name
is William J. Park.

628
01:31:50,665 --> 01:31:53,032
I'm an American negro.

629
01:31:54,889 --> 01:31:57,093
You're not disappointed?

630
01:31:58,666 --> 01:32:01,383
Were you looking
for a real native?

631
01:32:02,825 --> 01:32:07,298
Your son's asleep. He'd be
more comfortable in the back.

632
01:32:07,337 --> 01:32:08,581
Do you mind?

633
01:32:09,545 --> 01:32:11,454
I want a Fanta.

634
01:32:11,498 --> 01:32:14,345
OK, man,
we'll stop for one.

635
01:32:17,161 --> 01:32:21,503
I remember the day
I arrived in Africa.

636
01:32:21,545 --> 01:32:23,815
I was totally drunk.

637
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:30,210
In customs, I felt like kissing
the officers, my brothers.

638
01:32:31,177 --> 01:32:33,184
I told myself...

639
01:32:33,226 --> 01:32:36,455
"That's it, man, you're home."

640
01:32:38,793 --> 01:32:41,214
I kept my sweater on.

641
01:32:41,258 --> 01:32:45,829
I didn't even realize
I was dripping with sweat.

642
01:32:47,657 --> 01:32:52,447
I got ripped off at the airport
by the first cabbie.

643
01:32:54,217 --> 01:32:58,472
He didn't give a damn
that I was black.

644
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:03,042
He was probably right.

645
01:33:03,081 --> 01:33:05,951
Brothers here, brothers there.

646
01:33:08,585 --> 01:33:10,887
Yeah...

647
01:33:10,921 --> 01:33:14,663
I really stayed American.

648
01:33:16,649 --> 01:33:20,195
They don't give a shit
about guys like me here.

649
01:33:21,289 --> 01:33:23,077
Here, I'm nothing.

650
01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:25,952
I'm dreaming.

651
01:33:25,993 --> 01:33:30,663
If I died now,
I'd disappear totally.

652
01:33:33,673 --> 01:33:35,462
You don't say much.

653
01:33:36,586 --> 01:33:39,106
I've hung around Douala
for two weeks.

654
01:33:39,145 --> 01:33:42,593
I should be heading north.
I have my ticket.

655
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:45,567
You know people there?

656
01:33:45,609 --> 01:33:47,748
No.

657
01:33:47,785 --> 01:33:50,403
There's a house
I'd like to see again...

658
01:33:50,441 --> 01:33:52,099
but I don't know.

659
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:06,439
I'll come back
around 10:00?

660
01:34:06,473 --> 01:34:07,967
Suit yourself.

661
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:25,607
That's my wife. Now I live
alone. I was a big pain.

662
01:34:30,473 --> 01:34:32,066
Where to?

663
01:34:32,105 --> 01:34:34,244
To the Novotel, please.

664
01:34:39,913 --> 01:34:41,571
Thank you.

665
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:45,025
Give me your hand.

666
01:34:45,065 --> 01:34:48,807
I'll tell you if you should
go see your house.

667
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:53,478
Your palm is strange.
Can't see anything.

668
01:34:59,881 --> 01:35:01,856
Let's have a drink.

669
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:08,735
I don't think so, babe.

670
01:35:10,089 --> 01:35:13,864
Leave quickly
before they eat you up. Bye.
