1
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,200
I saw you walking.
May I drop you somewhere?

2
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,890
No, thanks.
I'm strolling.

3
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,800
Hey! This is Africa!
It's too hot to stroll.

4
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,530
Hop in.
I'll drive you.

5
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,970
Hello.

6
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,910
That's my son.

7
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,090
Where are you headed?

8
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,850
To Limbe.

9
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,190
You're a tourist?

10
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,600
Sort of.

11
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,570
Where can I drop you?

12
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,630
The bus station, please.

13
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,570
Are you broke?

14
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,840
No, but I don't feel
like taking a taxi.

15
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,110
Going native, huh?

16
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,050
Are you from Limbe?

17
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,810
No.

18
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,300
Thanks, again.

19
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,160
Are you going to Douala?

20
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,190
The next bus leaves
in an hour.

21
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,700
What a drag! Come on,
I'm going to Douala, too.

22
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,950
What's your name?

23
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,970
France.

24
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,020
"Vive la France!"

25
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,750
France!

26
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,910
Next year,
I'll widen this road.

27
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,440
France, stay close by.

28
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,980
Here's my riddle.

29
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,390
Yes.

30
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,480
"At the edge of the road,
a black thread."

31
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,080
"A lively ant."

32
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,290
What's worse, this crate
has no brakes left!

33
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,560
You're going to kill us!

34
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,660
It's only a question
of safety, darling.

35
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,430
Slowing down would surely
cause an accident.

36
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,900
Look! No feet! Isn't it...

37
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,500
Marc, please!

38
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,100
That's how it is!

39
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,270
We're going.

40
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,050
Everything's ready, gov'nor.

41
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,080
Fine.

42
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,490
Baby ant...

43
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,760
I'll see you in ten days.
Remember, write to grandma.

44
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,490
Yes.

45
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,630
Marc, should I order
these books from Paris?

46
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,260
Fasten the donkey's strap.

47
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,430
Done.

48
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,840
Last time we lost
half the coffee rations.

49
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,530
You were saying?

50
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,440
Never mind.

51
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,470
No kiss?

52
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,320
You'll do fine without me,
Madame Governor.

53
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,360
Remember to visit
the Norwegians.

54
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,230
Thanks, Protée, I entrust them
to you. Take good care of them.

55
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,440
You can serve coffee now.

56
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,460
Then it's time for a nap.

57
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,030
You're not in bed?

58
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,430
You'll see,
You'll turn black,

59
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,330
and your father
will scream!

60
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,750
"Ru...

61
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,460
"...dolf

62
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,940
"Dieneck."

63
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,700
"Kur Wess."

64
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,750
Kurt Weiss.

65
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,970
Kurt Weiss.

66
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,570
Weiss.

67
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,850
Did the Germans lose the war
in France, too?

68
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,080
Oh, yes, everywhere.

69
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,330
Do you think
we'll be buried here?

70
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,740
Would you like
a citronells, madame?

71
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,930
No, thank you, Protée.

72
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm trying to turn in.
Turn off the lights.

73
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,310
Good night.

74
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,110
Good night, madame.

75
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,440
Listen, Dieudonné...

76
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,500
If the king had given me...
No, wait.

77
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,610
If the king had...

78
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,710
If the king had given me
Paris, his great city

79
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,490
But without my luv
with me

80
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,830
I would tell King Henri,
take back your Paris

81
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,390
My luv means
far more to me, oh, yes

82
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
What does "my luv" mean?

83
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,470
"My luv" is my love.

84
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,840
"...And the money
for Aunt Minni.

85
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,650
"I won't forget to send you
3,000 francs soon.

86
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,810
"For Citabella's wedding.

87
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,010
"I'm expecting a letter
from you...

88
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,580
"but as they say,
no news is good news.

89
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,490
"Dear parents, I wish you
a long and healthy life.

90
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,830
"God bless you.
Your devoted son."

91
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,930
Protée, hurry up.
We must get back!

92
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,080
Protée must get back!

93
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,060
Must get back!
Must get back!

94
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,120
As you wish, ma'am Gov'nor.

95
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,910
For whom is that letter?

96
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,600
For my fiancée.

97
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,210
It's hot.

98
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,490
Did you spice it?

99
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,930
Eat.

100
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,020
Come quickly.

101
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,770
Is it the hyena?

102
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,150
Yes.

103
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,310
I think so.

104
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,660
Don't move.

105
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,190
Don't be afraid.

106
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,800
Protée!

107
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,850
Stay here, I'll be back.

108
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,360
Shit!

109
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,900
Protée!

110
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,240
I'm here, madame.

111
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,420
Where have you been?
I've called you for an hour!

112
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,650
Didn't you hear the hyena?
Come on!

113
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,190
Come on in!

114
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,660
It should be here...

115
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,480
I'm sure Marc keeps it here.

116
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,860
Here.

117
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,220
What about the bullets, madame?

118
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,260
Where are you going?

119
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,770
I'll check around
the house, madame.

120
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,240
No!

121
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,040
No, stay with me.

122
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,780
Settle down here.

123
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,090
That awful beast
could come in here any time.

124
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,150
Go to sleep now.

125
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,470
Good night, madame.

126
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,200
Thank you, Protée.

127
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,580
What's he saying?

128
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,820
For two months, lions
have been attacking herds.

129
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,420
Tell him I'll organize beats.

130
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,960
He says white men's beats
are bad.

131
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,480
Man must hunt the lion
with a knife...

132
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,290
and with arrows, freeboy.

133
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,660
Thank you for coming.

134
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,540
First the panthers,
then the hyenas.

135
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,730
You really attract
trouble, Nansen.

136
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,280
They've got a soft spot
for you.

137
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,110
It's God's will, isn't it?

138
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,380
Maybe, but I brought you food.

139
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,180
Thank you very much.
Come, have some tea.

140
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,690
Hello, Martha.
Are you well?

141
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,640
Really, Nansen, I don't know
what keeps you here!

142
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,080
Look at your wife! She's at
her wits' end! Time to leave!

143
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,350
I must evangelize the natives.
I'm a soldier of God.

144
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,550
Everything is fine!

145
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,760
You are totally zany, Nansen!

146
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,270
France! Protée!
We're leaving.

147
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,540
Enoch, it's over!

148
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,840
The Yorkshire pudding, custard
cream, boiled meat. Stop!

149
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,140
Enough!

150
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,700
You understand?

151
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,310
Explain it to him, Protée.

152
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,590
This book, there must be
hundreds of recipes in it!

153
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,860
I want French cuisine!
Variety!

154
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,200
Pies, salads...
Do you understand?

155
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,200
Madame, Enoch can't read.

156
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,180
You're joking! He's always
got his nose in his book!

157
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,430
He's going to
drive me crazy!

158
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,450
What's wrong with him?

159
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,260
He doesn't want
to cook anymore.

160
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,790
You say he's a bad chef.

161
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,860
And you always yell at him
like his first wife.

162
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,870
As soon as the master is away,
you all take advantage.

163
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,020
I'm fed up!

164
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,260
Push all this out,
all right, Robespierre?

165
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,740
Not the tomatoes, madame?

166
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,740
Not the tomatoes,
just the weeds!

167
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,800
Mommy!

168
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,540
We have visitors!

169
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,870
Ma'am Gov'nor!
Ma'am Gov'nor!

170
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,920
There's people arriving!
Many of them!

171
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,890
Come on over there!
They're there!

172
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,440
Jonathan Boothby!

173
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,950
Enoch.

174
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,650
It's tonight or never,
very English!

175
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,600
Perfect, or... or...

176
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:32,070
Enoch, I don't understand
any of what you're saying.

177
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,690
France!

178
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,840
Hurry up!

179
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,750
Don't forget the port.
I'll take care of the wine.

180
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,490
And... what else?

181
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,500
Oh, yes! Red sash, and take
your shower in the last minute.

182
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,670
Yes?

183
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,100
The Englishman
is wearing his tuxedo.

184
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,580
Oh, no!

185
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,460
Give this to Marie-Jeanne.
A touch with the iron will do.

186
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:56,030
Madame, shall I serve
the drinks?

187
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,400
Wait, come in.

188
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,900
Come closer.

189
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,980
Help me, Protée, would you?

190
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,810
Help me.

191
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,800
You're crazy, Jonathan!

192
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,840
I had no idea.

193
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,750
Opportunities for dancing
are rare here, you know.

194
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,010
Solitude, Aimée.

195
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:32,150
Me? The only time I'm alone
is in the shower.

196
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,670
Look, Jonathan.

197
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,050
"This house is
the last house on earth."

198
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,070
The German official
who inscribed this phrase...

199
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,610
is buried here.

200
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,080
Marc is a dreamer,
you know.

201
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,960
Does he still keep
his bloody Bororo diaries?

202
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,070
Marc and his notebook!

203
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,640
They say this official was
killed by one of his "boys."

204
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,090
Last time I visited here,
you were away.

205
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,970
We spoke and spoke,
and we drank.

206
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And toward morning...

207
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,130
...you understand?

208
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,170
So close,
that we slept together.

209
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,710
...felt bizarre...

210
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,280
because I have that same feeling
with you, Aimée.

211
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,380
I think there's a...

212
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,820
spell on this house.

213
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,260
You're tipsy, Jonathan.

214
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,760
Tipsy.

215
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,230
I think that's the best.

216
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,630
I'm leaving tomorrow
at dawn.

217
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,650
The queen of England
is ugly.

218
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:17,250
If he has a hairy back,
he has a hairy bottom.

219
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,340
Your Englishman is more
handsome when he's dressed.

220
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,250
He's not my Englishman!

221
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,310
Did you see his legs, honey?
They're like twigs!

222
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,250
I'm sleepy.

223
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,410
Is that you, Protée?

224
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,940
I'm waiting to turn off
the generator, madame.

225
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,860
The ticks will eat your feet!

226
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,050
Here's my riddle.

227
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,850
Yes.

228
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,790
"A charming young girl...

229
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:06,320
"weaves children
around her neck."

230
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,170
The papaya tree!

231
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,340
Where are they going?

232
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,840
Toward the Benoué.

233
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,210
Did you see other herds?
Many?

234
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,180
Yes, they'll all
come from the north.

235
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,180
They're certainly heading
for the Benoué.

236
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,850
Any sick livestock?

237
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,830
No, none, governor.

238
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,600
Do your work!

239
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,320
What are you doing here?

240
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,590
I made the bed.
Now I'm tidying up.

241
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:55,070
I forbid you to
fiddle with my belongings.

242
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,240
I don't want anyone
nosing around my bedroom.

243
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,010
Get out.

244
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,050
Protée.

245
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,260
Bring me some water, please.
I feel like taking a shower.

246
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,290
Mommy, let's go home.

247
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,690
Why do you go
to the cemetery?

248
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:03,670
Because I like it.
It's a quiet place.

249
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,040
Hurry up.

250
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:40,310
I'm coming, Etienne.
Forgive me.

251
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,190
Aimée! France!

252
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,720
Good morning, sir.

253
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,130
Is everything
all right, Protée?

254
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,370
Madame is in her bedroom, sir.

255
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,400
Aimée?

256
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,710
Aimée, are you ill?

257
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,790
You're not disappointed
to see your freeboy, honey?

258
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,290
Silly.

259
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,570
You frightened me.
I only expected you tomorrow.

260
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,590
I'm filthy.

261
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,350
I'm hungry.

262
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,230
Here.

263
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,700
You disgust me.

264
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,430
Dirty nigger.

265
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,680
It's too late.
The meat is overcooked now.

266
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,350
Hair?

267
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,420
Head?

268
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,430
Forehead?

269
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,000
Eyes?

270
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,030
Nose?

271
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,230
Mouth?

272
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,900
Teeth?

273
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,840
Tummy?

274
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,270
Chest?

275
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,780
It fell behind
the mountain.

276
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,910
That's enough now,
baby ant.

277
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,820
Planes don't fall.
They go beyond the horizon.

278
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,350
What's the horizon?

279
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,920
Go to sleep now.
I'll explain it tomorrow.

280
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,350
The plane fell
into the mountain.

281
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,800
My dear compatriot...

282
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,900
Please forgive this arrival,
so full of fanfare...

283
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:18,070
but we swept up everything
we found on the way.

284
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,740
Allow me to introduce myself.
Captain Védrine, pilot.

285
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,010
Last night I had to land
somewhere in the mountain.

286
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,390
Mechanical troubles. Absurd!
A propeller bearing broke.

287
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,520
I must confess that without...

288
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,050
the intrepid assistance
of these young boys...

289
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,430
my passengers and I...

290
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,590
would still be lost
somewhere in the bush.

291
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,970
Marc Dalens, District Officer.

292
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:44,940
Not the best circumstances.

293
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,500
You flew over
our house last night?

294
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,910
Affirmative.

295
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,840
Courbassol, my navigator
and associate.

296
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,940
Glad to meet you.
Anyone hurt?

297
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,070
No, no one.

298
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,450
Allow me to present
my unfortunate passengers.

299
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:02,120
Machinard, a colleague of yours,
I believe, and his wife.

300
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,990
Machinard,
what brings you here?

301
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,860
I'm replacing Bonaventure
in M'Banga.

302
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,160
We came from Fort Lamy.
I wanted to make a small detour.

303
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,760
It's Mireille's first trip.
She's discovering Africa.

304
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,430
We just got married.

305
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,700
We're on our honeymoon.

306
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,650
Congratulations!
Welcome to north Cameroon.

307
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:28,080
Make yourselves at home.
We'll take care of everything.

308
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,210
You'll see, M'Banga
is different, greener.

309
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:38,720
Here comes Delpich,
our charming planter.

310
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,600
Delpich, we thought
we'd lost you on the way!

311
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,690
Leave me alone, Védrine!

312
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:50,640
I'm losing money here
every single minute!

313
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,470
You should be in a nut house,
not flying a damn bird!

314
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,940
Delpich, Joseph,
coffee grower.

315
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,240
Marc Dalens.

316
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,110
Cut the ceremonies,
just get me out of here.

317
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,250
I'll radio Douala and Vaounde.
We'll find a way.

318
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,400
My wife will settle you in our
house. You're in good hands.

319
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,780
Where did I fall, anyway?

320
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,790
Mindif, in the Diamaré region.

321
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,760
30 kilometers south-east
of Maroua.

322
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:20,920
Mindif?
Védrine, tell me I'm dreaming!

323
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:26,900
Getting spare parts
could take weeks, you know.

324
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,900
I'm afraid so.

325
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,670
I'm starving.

326
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,710
Wait, Dalens.
That's Thérése, my housekeeper.

327
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,750
She's a bit shy.

328
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:08,370
Did you turn the mattresses
before making the beds?

329
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,540
Yes, madame.

330
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,310
They're stuck for a month.
A runway must be built.

331
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:21,420
France, stay out of the way.

332
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,980
Hello, Djatao.
How are you?

333
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:33,830
Your husband claimed there's
not a single jalopy available!

334
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,560
Please accept this gift for
your guests from the airplane.

335
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,900
Is this taxi yours?

336
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:42,530
Delpich, please meet
our dear friend Wadjirt Djatao.

337
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:46,970
Mr. Delpich is a coffee planter.
In the south, correct?

338
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,530
Yeah. How much for driving me
to Yaoundé?

339
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:55,020
Would you join us
for lunch, Djatao?

340
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,780
No, thank you, Aimée.
It's Ramadan.

341
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,760
Fine. Just name your price.

342
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,090
Good-bye, Aimée.

343
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,560
Thank you for your kindness,
Djatao. It's superb!

344
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,790
Thank you.

345
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,090
I got it.

346
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,930
Here.

347
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,470
This is my last offer.

348
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,800
How much?

349
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,610
How much?
Fuck it!

350
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,860
Do they run things
around here?

351
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:53,040
Protée, take the goat away.

352
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,130
Yes, madame.

353
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,820
In 10 days you'll be
at your post, Machinard.

354
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:00,980
You think so?

355
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,640
Yes, Marc received a cable.

356
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,550
Protée, you can serve coffee.

357
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,060
M'Banga...

358
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,820
you're lucky!

359
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,690
See, Mereille? I told you.

360
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:22,470
A nice little spot, M'Banga.

361
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,970
It's a bit humid, I hear.

362
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,510
It's like having
cotton balls...

363
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,480
stuffed in your lungs
and nostrils all day.

364
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,850
Actually, I like the forest.

365
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,410
The rot smell is so strong
it's like a drug.

366
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:42,550
What's worse are
the little crawlers.

367
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:46,220
They hide under the bed,
swarm in wash basins.

368
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,230
They even stick inside
your shoes.

369
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:51,890
The thought of lifting
the mosquito net is nauseating.

370
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,770
Gentlemen, you make it
seem worse than it is.

371
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,670
That's not all!
Mosquitoes, OK.

372
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,730
Less than month ago...

373
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,900
a whole family of settlers
was found cut into slices.

374
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:06,440
Delpich, please,
you're exaggerating!

375
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,250
Their heads were in
geranium pots on the veranda.

376
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,850
All this just 10 kilometers
from M'Banga.

377
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,620
A festering center
of revolt.

378
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,960
And whose fault,
I ask you.

379
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,830
I never sleep without
my piece under the pillow.

380
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,060
Protée!

381
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,840
Take these men to the kitchen.
They were on the road all day.

382
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,610
I have good news for you.

383
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,560
Our friend, Randall, is coming
to help, with 20 men.

384
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,110
Sir?

385
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,820
Mind your own business.

386
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,650
That's nice.

387
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:33,300
Not in bed yet, doll?

388
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,060
Isn't she cute?

389
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,070
Well, I'm going to bed.
Good night.

390
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,890
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

391
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,620
What's wrong with you,
Védrine?

392
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:28,950
Don't worry. A minor attack
of marsh fever. I'm used to it.

393
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,970
Look there... where I'm
pointing my finger.

394
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,700
See that dust?

395
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,870
It's Randall.

396
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,270
Glad to see you.

397
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,250
I'll bet you are.

398
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,650
Monique.

399
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:34,160
Here's the most beautiful!

400
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:36,180
How are you?

401
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,020
And little Paul?

402
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,330
He's wearing me out.

403
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,270
Go over there.

404
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,280
Wait, Segalen.

405
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,710
I'll make the introductions.

406
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,940
Marc Dalens.

407
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,110
Hello.

408
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,850
Courbassol, co-pilot.

409
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,190
My wife Aimée.

410
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,990
Excuse me,
I'll join the others.

411
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,930
He's a little... strange.

412
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,700
Tell me how it happened.

413
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,380
Right now road work
is slow. It's Ramadan.

414
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,310
I'll try to get you
transportation home.

415
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,170
Where did you find
your Segalen?

416
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:56,000
He's an ex-seminarian.
I don't know much about him.

417
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,870
One day, he showed up.

418
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,930
What's he doing in Africa?

419
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,000
Who knows? He says
he's crossing Africa on foot.

420
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,340
Monique thinks he's a saint.

421
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,460
You don't belong here, Segalen.

422
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,270
Come to my house in Mindif.
You're more than welcome.

423
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:43,950
Tony adores him.
Luc is wonderful with Paul.

424
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,290
He's set his mind on
starting him on Latin.

425
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,580
Really?

426
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:52,520
Really, Paul is talented.

427
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,000
He's handsome.

428
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,060
Who?

429
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:04,110
Your boy.

430
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,630
People no longer know
how to drink coffee.

431
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,840
They really don't.

432
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:48,480
I always add a few chips
of bitter chocolate...

433
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,010
two or three grains of salt...

434
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,390
and to top it off...

435
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,220
a touch of cinnamon.

436
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:15,440
Disgusting. Makes me
regret I grow it.

437
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,210
Should I fix it?

438
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,980
Go ahead.
It'll taste better.

439
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:43,540
I know a church
behind a hamlet

440
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:50,570
Where a fine steeple
is reflected in the water

441
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:58,210
In the pure water
of the river

442
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,920
It's a joke, Luc.
You left everything at home.

443
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,050
I have all I need.

444
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,190
And your books?

445
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,560
Keep them.

446
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,590
Luc, come home with us.

447
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,200
Kiss little Paul for me.

448
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,040
Bastard.

449
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,240
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

450
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:38,390
I had a premonition.
I told Thérése...

451
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:42,330
"Chickadee, pack the suitcase.
Tonight, we'll be far away."

452
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,530
What time is it?

453
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,190
Early.

454
01:08:57,110 --> 01:09:02,480
Luc, we have plenty of room.
You can have your own space.

455
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,840
No, thanks, Marc.
I'm really fine here.

456
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:12,850
Try these.
They're for you.

457
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:17,420
Thank you, Protée.
Please bring another cup.

458
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,760
I'll go check
on the runway's progress.

459
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,640
Then I have an inheritance
matter to settle in Japat.

460
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,210
Want to come?

461
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,510
Not today, thank you.
May I?

462
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:38,540
If you like. It's just
my notes from when I travel.

463
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:45,290
Did you see mr. Luc
this morning?

464
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,520
He's bathing outside, madame.

465
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,850
What do you mean, outside?

466
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,720
In the boys' area, madame.

467
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:04,800
I'll do it, madame.

468
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,600
No, never mind.

469
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:12,380
The sheets and pillow cases
need changing.

470
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,710
All done?

471
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,430
Look! Move over.

472
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,130
We need two more meters.
Rip these out and flatten it.

473
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,470
They're madam's flowers.

474
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,480
You want to play?

475
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:47,210
Don't argue. It's the only spot
where we can play in the shade.

476
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:52,610
"Amidst bronzed
black African faces...

477
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:57,680
"the white skin color evokes
something akin to death."

478
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,960
"In 1891, I, myself,

479
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:06,830
"having seen only colored
people for months..."

480
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:09,230
What is it, Protée?

481
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:11,710
I'm bringing
lemon squash, madame.

482
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,410
"In 1891, I, myself,
having seen only..."

483
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,320
Put the tray down, Protée.

484
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:31,650
"In 1891, I, myself...

485
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:36,650
"having seen only
colored people for months...

486
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,330
"once again saw Europeans
near the Benoué.

487
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,770
"I found white skin unnatural...

488
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,000
"next to the fullness
of black skin."

489
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,800
"Then why blame the natives
for considering the white man...

490
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:55,350
"as something contrary
to nature...

491
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,980
"as a supernatural
or fiendish creature?"

492
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:07,390
Aim or shoot!

493
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,450
It's a "bird head!"

494
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:35,580
Protée, go and get
the pickup, please.

495
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:43,490
What are you doing here?
Not in bed?

496
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:46,770
She's swallowing her tongue.

497
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,530
Put a spoon in her mouth.

498
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,040
Let's get Prosper
from the village.

499
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:53,510
With a spoon, honey.

500
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,680
He's at the school
with the teacher.

501
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,560
His wife gave me his case.

502
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,290
What do they do at night
at the school?

503
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:20,600
They're talking, sir.

504
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,570
Yes, I know.

505
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,520
Prosper!

506
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:47,650
Prosper, come quickly!

507
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:56,130
I need you.
I have your case.

508
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:17,860
Where's my wife?

509
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,860
At Mrs. Machinard's bedside.

510
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,350
Prosper, it's the room
on the right. Thank you.

511
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,160
Protée's starting
the generator.

512
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:34,930
Prosper treated us all.

513
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,970
So we're saved, Dalens.

514
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,000
We're saved.

515
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,080
It isn't possible, Dalens.

516
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,560
Have you no one else
who can treat her?

517
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,430
Are you serious, Machinard?

518
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:59,960
- I'm leaving, sir.
- I'll walk you.

519
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,000
I wouldn't mind, but my wife
needs a real doctor.

520
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,010
I pity you.

521
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,670
The car's coming
early tomorrow.

522
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:09,010
You'll be in Yaoundé soon.

523
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,030
Dirty nigger!

524
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,510
You're a doctor?

525
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:18,420
You're not good enough
to wipe a white man's ass.

526
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,150
Well, I understand, Mireille.

527
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,620
That's the way
to speak to them.

528
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,650
All right, all right.

529
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:27,920
Leave him alone, Segalen.

530
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,990
Oh, I forgot
the loop-the-loop king.

531
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,700
You make me sick.

532
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:39,000
André, I don't feel well.

533
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,900
One can't say a word

534
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:45,610
without being accused
of the worst things.

535
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,850
A nice trio, Dalens! You,
your wife, and the parasite.

536
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,250
I'm just discussing!

537
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,520
All right, that's enough.

538
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,150
Prosper, yop-la-boom,
he's the man all the ladies seek

539
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:05,570
Prosper, yop-la-boom, he's
the king of the street

540
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,190
One day, we'll get
kicked out of here.

541
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,070
Good luck.

542
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,920
This is the boys' shower.

543
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,170
Protée...

544
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:53,680
you're a pain.

545
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,840
Aimée, it's the most beautiful
bathroom in the world.

546
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:12,590
In French, most words
ending in "e"

547
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,620
are feminine.

548
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:21,260
However, some masculine words
end in a silent "e."

549
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:44,150
Go ahead, Protée.

550
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,750
I don't observe Ramadan.

551
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,960
What's the matter?

552
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,060
The boss said to tell you
the truck from Douala is here.

553
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,230
It's the propeller.

554
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,340
Let's go.

555
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,740
Our dear Dalens can't wait
until we leave.

556
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,080
The runway is almost finished...

557
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,810
but let me point out...

558
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,790
that if the rains are
slightly early this year...

559
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:19,380
we're back to square one
for at least 4 months.

560
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:27,400
Protée, please bring the fruit.

561
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,890
A half?

562
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,120
Gladly.

563
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,130
Listen to the night sounds.
Listen carefully.

564
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:17,280
It's deadly.

565
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,190
Don't exaggerate.

566
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:21,280
Aimée...

567
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,220
I've decided not to eat
with your guests anymore.

568
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:33,590
You think I enjoy squatting
between Enoch, who rambles on,

569
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,420
and Protée, who pouts?

570
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,160
Right, Protée?

571
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:01,010
Say it bothers you
that I'm here.

572
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:06,930
No?

573
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:13,170
Well...

574
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,170
I think he's mute.

575
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,440
Actually, Aimée...

576
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,380
you'd like to be in my place,
rubbing against Protée.

577
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:33,650
Come, I'll make room
for you.

578
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,990
No?

579
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,570
Madame?

580
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:57,870
Thank you, Protée.
I don't need anything.

581
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,000
Beat it.
Leave me alone.

582
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,150
Must I repeat it,
you son of a bitch?

583
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,500
What? You don't like it?

584
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:58,330
Fuck off! Go lick the boots
of your bosses.

585
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:03,700
You're worse than the priests
who raised you.

586
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:26,180
You still want to know
what the horizon is?

587
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,790
Are you asleep?

588
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,760
When you look
at the hills...

589
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,330
beyond the houses
and beyond the trees...

590
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,770
where the earth
touches the sky...

591
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:48,640
that's the horizon.

592
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:54,340
Tomorrow, in the daytime,
I'll show you something.

593
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:04,120
The closer you get to that line,
the farther it moves.

594
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:11,790
If you walk towards it,
it moves away.

595
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:13,630
It flees from you.

596
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,700
I must also explain
this to you.

597
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,910
You see the line.

598
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,540
You see it,
but it doesn't exist.

599
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,770
Do you want some chocolate?

600
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:50,240
No, too early.

601
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:06,350
Thank you, Protée.

602
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,230
You're here.

603
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,340
Luc left?

604
01:28:34,450 --> 01:28:35,970
Yes?

605
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,610
Yes, he left.

606
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,380
Without saying anything?

607
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:45,320
Why didn't you wake me up?

608
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,360
You always get taken in, Marc.

609
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:58,800
I'd rather Protée
stopped working in the house.

610
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,440
Put him where you like...
somewhere else.

611
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,340
Protée's very good.

612
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,820
Please, Marc.

613
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,850
He'll work in the garage.

614
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,850
Does it burn?

615
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,570
Aimée.

616
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:00,550
Have a good trip.

617
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:01,810
Thank you.

618
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,180
Good-bye, Dalens.

619
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:35,710
No, it'll never fit.
See the size of my door?

620
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:38,910
Let's go. All aboard.
Forget the organ.

621
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:42,580
You two. Move this thing.
It's in the way.

622
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:43,920
Let's go!

623
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:53,920
I'll come back.

624
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:42,910
My son's name is Sawa.
His mother's a Sawa.

625
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,710
I'm Mungo.

626
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:48,080
Mungo is a nickname
they gave me here.

627
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:52,640
My real name
is William J. Park.

628
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:55,150
I'm an American negro.

629
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:59,390
You're not disappointed?

630
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:03,860
Were you looking
for a real native?

631
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:10,030
Your son's asleep. He'd be
more comfortable in the back.

632
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:11,370
Do you mind?

633
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:14,360
I want a Fanta.

634
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:17,380
OK, man,
we'll stop for one.

635
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:24,840
I remember the day
I arrived in Africa.

636
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:27,250
I was totally drunk.

637
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:33,920
In customs, I felt like kissing
the officers, my brothers.

638
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:37,020
I told myself...

639
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:40,430
"That's it, man, you're home."

640
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:45,390
I kept my sweater on.

641
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:50,210
I didn't even realize
I was dripping with sweat.

642
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:57,110
I got ripped off at the airport
by the first cabbie.

643
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:03,390
He didn't give a damn
that I was black.

644
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:08,150
He was probably right.

645
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,190
Brothers here, brothers there.

646
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:16,330
Yeah...

647
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:20,270
I really stayed American.

648
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:26,040
They don't give a shit
about guys like me here.

649
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,050
Here, I'm nothing.

650
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:32,040
I'm dreaming.

651
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:36,950
If I died now,
I'd disappear totally.

652
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:41,960
You don't say much.

653
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:45,760
I've hung around Douala
for two weeks.

654
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,390
I should be heading north.
I have my ticket.

655
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:52,500
You know people there?

656
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,770
No.

657
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:57,540
There's a house
I'd like to see again...

658
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,310
but I don't know.

659
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:14,260
I'll come back
around 10:00?

660
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:15,850
Suit yourself.

661
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:34,250
That's my wife. Now I live
alone. I was a big pain.

662
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:40,980
Where to?

663
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:43,250
To the Novotel, please.

664
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,890
Thank you.

665
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:54,490
Give me your hand.

666
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:58,440
I'll tell you if you should
go see your house.

667
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:03,310
Your palm is strange.
Can't see anything.

668
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:12,040
Let's have a drink.

669
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:19,220
I don't think so, babe.

670
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:24,560
Leave quickly
before they eat you up. Bye.
