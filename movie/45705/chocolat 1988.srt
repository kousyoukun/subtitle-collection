1
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:14,200
I saw you walking.
May I drop you somewhere?

2
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,898
No, thanks.
I'm strolling.

3
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:18,805
Hey! This is Africa!
It's too hot to stroll.

4
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,537
Hop in.
I'll drive you.

5
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:28,979
Hello.

6
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,913
That's my son.

7
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,093
Where are you headed?

8
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:40,857
To Limbe.

9
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,192
You're a tourist?

10
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,600
Sort of.

11
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,572
Where can I drop you?

12
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,631
The bus station, please.

13
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,576
Are you broke?

14
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:57,842
No, but I don't feel
like taking a taxi.

15
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,111
Going native, huh?

16
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,050
Are you from Limbe?

17
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,814
No.

18
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,302
Thanks, again.

19
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,166
Are you going to Douala?

20
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,193
The next bus leaves
in an hour.

21
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,701
What a drag! Come on,
I'm going to Douala, too.

22
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,952
What's your name?

23
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,979
France.

24
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,027
"Vive la France!"

25
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,750
France!

26
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:59,912
Next year,
I'll widen this road.

27
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,443
France, stay close by.

28
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,982
Here's my riddle.

29
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:11,390
Yes.

30
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:14,487
"At the edge of the road,
a black thread."

31
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,088
"A lively ant."

32
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:51,296
What's worse, this crate
has no brakes left!

33
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,568
You're going to kill us!

34
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,664
It's only a question
of safety, darling.

35
00:10:56,705 --> 00:11:00,436
Slowing down would surely
cause an accident.

36
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,909
Look! No feet! Isn't it...

37
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,502
Marc, please!

38
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:06,105
That's how it is!

39
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:50,278
We're going.

40
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,056
Everything's ready, gov'nor.

41
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,081
Fine.

42
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,490
Baby ant...

43
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:07,762
I'll see you in ten days.
Remember, write to grandma.

44
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:09,498
Yes.

45
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,632
Marc, should I order
these books from Paris?

46
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,267
Fasten the donkey's strap.

47
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,436
Done.

48
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:18,844
Last time we lost
half the coffee rations.

49
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,538
You were saying?

50
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,447
Never mind.

51
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,475
No kiss?

52
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,320
You'll do fine without me,
Madame Governor.

53
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,364
Remember to visit
the Norwegians.

54
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:51,236
Thanks, Prot�e, I entrust them
to you. Take good care of them.

55
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:09,448
You can serve coffee now.

56
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,460
Then it's time for a nap.

57
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,034
You're not in bed?

58
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,434
You'll see,
You'll turn black,

59
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,339
and your father
will scream!

60
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,758
"Ru...

61
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,465
"...dolf

62
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,940
"Dieneck."

63
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,709
"Kur Wess."

64
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,750
Kurt Weiss.

65
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,978
Kurt Weiss.

66
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:19,577
Weiss.

67
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:24,857
Did the Germans lose the war
in France, too?

68
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,087
Oh, yes, everywhere.

69
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:30,331
Do you think
we'll be buried here?

70
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,740
Would you like
a citronells, madame?

71
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,938
No, thank you, Prot�e.

72
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,003
I'm trying to turn in.
Turn off the lights.

73
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,315
Good night.

74
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,117
Good night, madame.

75
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:19,446
Listen, Dieudonn�...

76
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:25,509
If the king had given me...
No, wait.

77
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,613
If the king had...

78
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,718
If the king had given me
Paris, his great city

79
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:38,495
But without my luv
with me

80
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:42,833
I would tell King Henri,
take back your Paris

81
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:47,399
My luv means
far more to me, oh, yes

82
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,966
What does "my luv" mean?

83
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,478
"My luv" is my love.

84
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,845
"...And the money
for Aunt Minni.

85
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,652
"I won't forget to send you
3,000 francs soon.

86
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,817
"For Citabella's wedding.

87
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,019
"I'm expecting a letter
from you...

88
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,587
"but as they say,
no news is good news.

89
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:46,499
"Dear parents, I wish you
a long and healthy life.

90
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:50,835
"God bless you.
Your devoted son."

91
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:54,933
Prot�e, hurry up.
We must get back!

92
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,083
Prot�e must get back!

93
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,064
Must get back!
Must get back!

94
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,126
As you wish, ma'am Gov'nor.

95
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,910
For whom is that letter?

96
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,608
For my fianc�e.

97
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,217
It's hot.

98
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,494
Did you spice it?

99
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:56,930
Eat.

100
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,023
Come quickly.

101
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:20,778
Is it the hyena?

102
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:22,153
Yes.

103
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,316
I think so.

104
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:32,663
Don't move.

105
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:34,191
Don't be afraid.

106
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:48,806
Prot�e!

107
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,854
Stay here, I'll be back.

108
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,365
Shit!

109
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,906
Prot�e!

110
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:22,246
I'm here, madame.

111
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,422
Where have you been?
I've called you for an hour!

112
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:31,653
Didn't you hear the hyena?
Come on!

113
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:36,195
Come on in!

114
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:45,667
It should be here...

115
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,484
I'm sure Marc keeps it here.

116
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:08,860
Here.

117
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:11,229
What about the bullets, madame?

118
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,260
Where are you going?

119
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:19,773
I'll check around
the house, madame.

120
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,242
No!

121
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,040
No, stay with me.

122
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,780
Settle down here.

123
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:43,091
That awful beast
could come in here any time.

124
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:11,150
Go to sleep now.

125
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,472
Good night, madame.

126
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,207
Thank you, Prot�e.

127
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:14,587
What's he saying?

128
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:19,821
For two months, lions
have been attacking herds.

129
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:24,427
Tell him I'll organize beats.

130
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:56,963
He says white men's beats
are bad.

131
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:59,489
Man must hunt the lion
with a knife...

132
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,298
and with arrows, freeboy.

133
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:15,669
Thank you for coming.

134
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,541
First the panthers,
then the hyenas.

135
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:19,739
You really attract
trouble, Nansen.

136
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,280
They've got a soft spot
for you.

137
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:25,115
It's God's will, isn't it?

138
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:27,383
Maybe, but I brought you food.

139
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:31,188
Thank you very much.
Come, have some tea.

140
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:40,692
Hello, Martha.
Are you well?

141
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:31,649
Really, Nansen, I don't know
what keeps you here!

142
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:36,089
Look at your wife! She's at
her wits' end! Time to leave!

143
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:40,356
I must evangelize the natives.
I'm a soldier of God.

144
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:43,558
Everything is fine!

145
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:46,761
You are totally zany, Nansen!

146
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,271
France! Prot�e!
We're leaving.

147
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,540
Enoch, it's over!

148
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,841
The Yorkshire pudding, custard
cream, boiled meat. Stop!

149
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:33,141
Enough!

150
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,706
You understand?

151
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:39,319
Explain it to him, Prot�e.

152
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:52,593
This book, there must be
hundreds of recipes in it!

153
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:55,864
I want French cuisine!
Variety!

154
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:58,201
Pies, salads...
Do you understand?

155
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,206
Madame, Enoch can't read.

156
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:15,185
You're joking! He's always
got his nose in his book!

157
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,431
He's going to
drive me crazy!

158
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,458
What's wrong with him?

159
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:05,268
He doesn't want
to cook anymore.

160
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,796
You say he's a bad chef.

161
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,867
And you always yell at him
like his first wife.

162
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:13,870
As soon as the master is away,
you all take advantage.

163
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:08,026
I'm fed up!

164
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,269
Push all this out,
all right, Robespierre?

165
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:15,741
Not the tomatoes, madame?

166
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,745
Not the tomatoes,
just the weeds!

167
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,804
Mommy!

168
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:22,543
We have visitors!

169
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,879
Ma'am Gov'nor!
Ma'am Gov'nor!

170
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,925
There's people arriving!
Many of them!

171
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:36,896
Come on over there!
They're there!

172
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,449
Jonathan Boothby!

173
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:05,950
Enoch.

174
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:10,654
It's tonight or never,
very English!

175
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,605
Perfect, or... or...

176
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:32,079
Enoch, I don't understand
any of what you're saying.

177
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:48,693
France!

178
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,842
Hurry up!

179
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,758
Don't forget the port.
I'll take care of the wine.

180
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:19,493
And... what else?

181
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:23,501
Oh, yes! Red sash, and take
your shower in the last minute.

182
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:32,674
Yes?

183
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:36,109
The Englishman
is wearing his tuxedo.

184
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,583
Oh, no!

185
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:50,462
Give this to Marie-Jeanne.
A touch with the iron will do.

186
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:56,030
Madame, shall I serve
the drinks?

187
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,402
Wait, come in.

188
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:04,906
Come closer.

189
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,982
Help me, Prot�e, would you?

190
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:16,818
Help me.

191
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,801
You're crazy, Jonathan!

192
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:16,846
I had no idea.

193
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:21,753
Opportunities for dancing
are rare here, you know.

194
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,018
Solitude, Aim�e.

195
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:32,156
Me? The only time I'm alone
is in the shower.

196
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,674
Look, Jonathan.

197
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,050
"This house is
the last house on earth."

198
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:56,079
The German official
who inscribed this phrase...

199
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:57,613
is buried here.

200
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:04,089
Marc is a dreamer,
you know.

201
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:17,967
Does he still keep
his bloody Bororo diaries?

202
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,071
Marc and his notebook!

203
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,644
They say this official was
killed by one of his "boys."

204
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:43,092
Last time I visited here,
you were away.

205
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:48,972
We spoke and spoke,
and we drank.

206
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:52,001
And toward morning...

207
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:54,139
...you understand?

208
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:57,173
So close,
that we slept together.

209
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:00,710
...felt bizarre...

210
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:04,281
because I have that same feeling
with you, Aim�e.

211
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:06,384
I think there's a...

212
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,825
spell on this house.

213
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:12,263
You're tipsy, Jonathan.

214
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,766
Tipsy.

215
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,234
I think that's the best.

216
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:27,637
I'm leaving tomorrow
at dawn.

217
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:12,653
The queen of England
is ugly.

218
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:17,255
If he has a hairy back,
he has a hairy bottom.

219
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:38,340
Your Englishman is more
handsome when he's dressed.

220
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:40,250
He's not my Englishman!

221
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:44,314
Did you see his legs, honey?
They're like twigs!

222
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:48,258
I'm sleepy.

223
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,417
Is that you, Prot�e?

224
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:14,944
I'm waiting to turn off
the generator, madame.

225
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,866
The ticks will eat your feet!

226
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:55,053
Here's my riddle.

227
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,859
Yes.

228
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,799
"A charming young girl...

229
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:06,329
"weaves children
around her neck."

230
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:08,170
The papaya tree!

231
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,349
Where are they going?

232
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:17,840
Toward the Benou�.

233
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:20,217
Did you see other herds?
Many?

234
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,189
Yes, they'll all
come from the north.

235
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:25,181
They're certainly heading
for the Benou�.

236
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:30,855
Any sick livestock?

237
00:42:30,898 --> 00:42:32,832
No, none, governor.

238
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,603
Do your work!

239
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:34,322
What are you doing here?

240
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,592
I made the bed.
Now I'm tidying up.

241
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,076
I forbid you to
fiddle with my belongings.

242
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:59,245
I don't want anyone
nosing around my bedroom.

243
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:01,015
Get out.

244
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,055
Prot�e.

245
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:15,262
Bring me some water, please.
I feel like taking a shower.

246
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:22,297
Mommy, let's go home.

247
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:58,696
Why do you go
to the cemetery?

248
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:03,676
Because I like it.
It's a quiet place.

249
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:07,040
Hurry up.

250
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:40,310
I'm coming, Etienne.
Forgive me.

251
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,196
Aim�e! France!

252
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:05,727
Good morning, sir.

253
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:09,139
Is everything
all right, Prot�e?

254
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,371
Madame is in her bedroom, sir.

255
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:15,405
Aim�e?

256
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:17,713
Aim�e, are you ill?

257
00:47:26,493 --> 00:47:29,792
You're not disappointed
to see your freeboy, honey?

258
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,298
Silly.

259
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:39,570
You frightened me.
I only expected you tomorrow.

260
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,597
I'm filthy.

261
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,353
I'm hungry.

262
00:49:16,002 --> 00:49:17,230
Here.

263
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,704
You disgust me.

264
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:21,434
Dirty nigger.

265
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:34,685
It's too late.
The meat is overcooked now.

266
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:41,352
Hair?

267
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:43,422
Head?

268
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:46,431
Forehead?

269
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:50,000
Eyes?

270
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:54,034
Nose?

271
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:57,236
Mouth?

272
00:49:58,044 --> 00:49:59,909
Teeth?

273
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:02,845
Tummy?

274
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,275
Chest?

275
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:43,788
It fell behind
the mountain.

276
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,916
That's enough now,
baby ant.

277
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,828
Planes don't fall.
They go beyond the horizon.

278
00:50:48,828 --> 00:50:51,353
What's the horizon?

279
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:53,923
Go to sleep now.
I'll explain it tomorrow.

280
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:15,354
The plane fell
into the mountain.

281
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:09,805
My dear compatriot...

282
00:52:09,843 --> 00:52:12,903
Please forgive this arrival,
so full of fanfare...

283
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:18,077
but we swept up everything
we found on the way.

284
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:21,747
Allow me to introduce myself.
Captain V�drine, pilot.

285
00:52:21,788 --> 00:52:25,019
Last night I had to land
somewhere in the mountain.

286
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,391
Mechanical troubles. Absurd!
A propeller bearing broke.

287
00:52:28,428 --> 00:52:31,522
I must confess that without...

288
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:34,055
the intrepid assistance
of these young boys...

289
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,432
my passengers and I...

290
00:52:36,469 --> 00:52:38,596
would still be lost
somewhere in the bush.

291
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:41,971
Marc Dalens, District Officer.

292
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:44,944
Not the best circumstances.

293
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:47,504
You flew over
our house last night?

294
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:48,912
Affirmative.

295
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:50,848
Courbassol, my navigator
and associate.

296
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:52,943
Glad to meet you.
Anyone hurt?

297
00:52:52,986 --> 00:52:54,078
No, no one.

298
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,453
Allow me to present
my unfortunate passengers.

299
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:02,120
Machinard, a colleague of yours,
I believe, and his wife.

300
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,994
Machinard,
what brings you here?

301
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:09,866
I'm replacing Bonaventure
in M'Banga.

302
00:53:09,903 --> 00:53:13,168
We came from Fort Lamy.
I wanted to make a small detour.

303
00:53:13,206 --> 00:53:16,767
It's Mireille's first trip.
She's discovering Africa.

304
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,438
We just got married.

305
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:20,707
We're on our honeymoon.

306
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:23,650
Congratulations!
Welcome to north Cameroon.

307
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:28,087
Make yourselves at home.
We'll take care of everything.

308
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:32,215
You'll see, M'Banga
is different, greener.

309
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:38,724
Here comes Delpich,
our charming planter.

310
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:43,600
Delpich, we thought
we'd lost you on the way!

311
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:46,696
Leave me alone, V�drine!

312
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:50,641
I'm losing money here
every single minute!

313
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:54,477
You should be in a nut house,
not flying a damn bird!

314
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:58,949
Delpich, Joseph,
coffee grower.

315
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:00,246
Marc Dalens.

316
00:54:00,286 --> 00:54:03,119
Cut the ceremonies,
just get me out of here.

317
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,250
I'll radio Douala and Vaounde.
We'll find a way.

318
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:10,729
My wife will settle you in our
house. You're in good hands.

319
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:11,828
Where did I fall, anyway?

320
00:54:11,865 --> 00:54:13,833
Mindif, in the Diamar� region.

321
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,800
30 kilometers south-east
of Maroua.

322
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:20,966
Mindif?
V�drine, tell me I'm dreaming!

323
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:26,943
Getting spare parts
could take weeks, you know.

324
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,948
I'm afraid so.

325
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:32,710
I'm starving.

326
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:44,756
Wait, Dalens.
That's Th�r�se, my housekeeper.

327
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:46,789
She's a bit shy.

328
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:08,410
Did you turn the mattresses
before making the beds?

329
00:55:08,455 --> 00:55:09,581
Yes, madame.

330
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:15,352
They're stuck for a month.
A runway must be built.

331
00:55:18,498 --> 00:55:21,467
France, stay out of the way.

332
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:30,025
Hello, Djatao.
How are you?

333
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,870
Your husband claimed there's
not a single jalopy available!

334
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:37,604
Please accept this gift for
your guests from the airplane.

335
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,941
Is this taxi yours?

336
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:42,573
Delpich, please meet
our dear friend Wadjirt Djatao.

337
00:56:42,615 --> 00:56:47,018
Mr. Delpich is a coffee planter.
In the south, correct?

338
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:49,578
Yeah. How much for driving me
to Yaound�?

339
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,059
Would you join us
for lunch, Djatao?

340
00:56:55,095 --> 00:56:58,826
No, thank you, Aim�e.
It's Ramadan.

341
00:56:58,865 --> 00:57:00,799
Fine. Just name your price.

342
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,131
Good-bye, Aim�e.

343
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,604
Thank you for your kindness,
Djatao. It's superb!

344
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:07,833
Thank you.

345
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:10,135
I got it.

346
00:57:12,712 --> 00:57:13,974
Here.

347
00:57:16,816 --> 00:57:19,512
This is my last offer.

348
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:23,846
How much?

349
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,653
How much?
Fuck it!

350
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:36,900
Do they run things
around here?

351
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,084
Prot�e, take the goat away.

352
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,177
Yes, madame.

353
00:57:55,422 --> 00:57:59,859
In 10 days you'll be
at your post, Machinard.

354
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,019
You think so?

355
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,688
Yes, Marc received a cable.

356
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,591
Prot�e, you can serve coffee.

357
00:58:09,636 --> 00:58:11,103
M'Banga...

358
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:13,867
you're lucky!

359
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:17,737
See, Mereille? I told you.

360
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:22,510
A nice little spot, M'Banga.

361
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:25,017
It's a bit humid, I hear.

362
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,550
It's like having
cotton balls...

363
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,523
stuffed in your lungs
and nostrils all day.

364
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:33,890
Actually, I like the forest.

365
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,454
The rot smell is so strong
it's like a drug.

366
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:42,594
What's worse are
the little crawlers.

367
00:58:42,635 --> 00:58:46,264
They hide under the bed,
swarm in wash basins.

368
00:58:46,473 --> 00:58:48,270
They even stick inside
your shoes.

369
00:58:48,475 --> 00:58:51,933
The thought of lifting
the mosquito net is nauseating.

370
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:54,811
Gentlemen, you make it
seem worse than it is.

371
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:57,715
That's not all!
Mosquitoes, OK.

372
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,775
Less than month ago...

373
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:02,947
a whole family of settlers
was found cut into slices.

374
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:06,481
Delpich, please,
you're exaggerating!

375
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:09,290
Their heads were in
geranium pots on the veranda.

376
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:11,896
All this just 10 kilometers
from M'Banga.

377
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:13,660
A festering center
of revolt.

378
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:19,000
And whose fault,
I ask you.

379
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:21,871
I never sleep without
my piece under the pillow.

380
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:26,102
Prot�e!

381
00:59:29,682 --> 00:59:33,880
Take these men to the kitchen.
They were on the road all day.

382
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:46,657
I have good news for you.

383
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:50,601
Our friend, Randall, is coming
to help, with 20 men.

384
01:00:14,994 --> 01:00:17,155
Sir?

385
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:19,859
Mind your own business.

386
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,697
That's nice.

387
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:33,340
Not in bed yet, doll?

388
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,108
Isn't she cute?

389
01:00:40,086 --> 01:00:43,112
Well, I'm going to bed.
Good night.

390
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:07,938
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

391
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,662
What's wrong with you,
V�drine?

392
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:28,997
Don't worry. A minor attack
of marsh fever. I'm used to it.

393
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:17,016
Look there... where I'm
pointing my finger.

394
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:18,745
See that dust?

395
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:20,912
It's Randall.

396
01:02:26,225 --> 01:02:28,318
Glad to see you.

397
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:30,295
I'll bet you are.

398
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,695
Monique.

399
01:02:32,732 --> 01:02:34,199
Here's the most beautiful!

400
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:36,224
How are you?

401
01:02:39,939 --> 01:02:41,065
And little Paul?

402
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:43,371
He's wearing me out.

403
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:49,313
Go over there.

404
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,320
Wait, Segalen.

405
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,758
I'll make the introductions.

406
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:01,987
Marc Dalens.

407
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,155
Hello.

408
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,893
Courbassol, co-pilot.

409
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:09,231
My wife Aim�e.

410
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:13,033
Excuse me,
I'll join the others.

411
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:18,972
He's a little... strange.

412
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:21,741
Tell me how it happened.

413
01:03:25,485 --> 01:03:28,420
Right now road work
is slow. It's Ramadan.

414
01:03:28,454 --> 01:03:31,355
I'll try to get you
transportation home.

415
01:03:49,776 --> 01:03:52,210
Where did you find
your Segalen?

416
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:56,044
He's an ex-seminarian.
I don't know much about him.

417
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,913
One day, he showed up.

418
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,975
What's he doing in Africa?

419
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:04,046
Who knows? He says
he's crossing Africa on foot.

420
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:07,388
Monique thinks he's a saint.

421
01:04:23,876 --> 01:04:26,504
You don't belong here, Segalen.

422
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:30,312
Come to my house in Mindif.
You're more than welcome.

423
01:04:38,825 --> 01:04:43,990
Tony adores him.
Luc is wonderful with Paul.

424
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,329
He's set his mind on
starting him on Latin.

425
01:04:47,366 --> 01:04:48,628
Really?

426
01:04:48,835 --> 01:04:52,566
Really, Paul is talented.

427
01:04:58,177 --> 01:05:00,042
He's handsome.

428
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,104
Who?

429
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:04,149
Your boy.

430
01:05:34,547 --> 01:05:38,677
People no longer know
how to drink coffee.

431
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:41,880
They really don't.

432
01:05:43,222 --> 01:05:48,524
I always add a few chips
of bitter chocolate...

433
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:51,052
two or three grains of salt...

434
01:05:51,097 --> 01:05:53,429
and to top it off...

435
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:56,264
a touch of cinnamon.

436
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:15,479
Disgusting. Makes me
regret I grow it.

437
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:18,251
Should I fix it?

438
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:21,021
Go ahead.
It'll taste better.

439
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:43,582
I know a church
behind a hamlet

440
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:50,613
Where a fine steeple
is reflected in the water

441
01:06:50,656 --> 01:06:58,256
In the pure water
of the river

442
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:04,968
It's a joke, Luc.
You left everything at home.

443
01:07:05,004 --> 01:07:07,097
I have all I need.

444
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:08,231
And your books?

445
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,608
Keep them.

446
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:12,634
Luc, come home with us.

447
01:07:15,982 --> 01:07:18,246
Kiss little Paul for me.

448
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:21,082
Bastard.

449
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:25,282
Here's your seed,
my little chickadee.

450
01:07:34,734 --> 01:07:38,431
I had a premonition.
I told Th�r�se...

451
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:42,373
"Chickadee, pack the suitcase.
Tonight, we'll be far away."

452
01:08:47,106 --> 01:08:48,573
What time is it?

453
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:50,234
Early.

454
01:08:57,149 --> 01:09:02,519
Luc, we have plenty of room.
You can have your own space.

455
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,887
No, thanks, Marc.
I'm really fine here.

456
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:12,893
Try these.
They're for you.

457
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:17,466
Thank you, Prot�e.
Please bring another cup.

458
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,801
I'll go check
on the runway's progress.

459
01:09:26,846 --> 01:09:30,680
Then I have an inheritance
matter to settle in Japat.

460
01:09:30,716 --> 01:09:32,251
Want to come?

461
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,549
Not today, thank you.
May I?

462
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:38,580
If you like. It's just
my notes from when I travel.

463
01:09:42,394 --> 01:09:45,329
Did you see mr. Luc
this morning?

464
01:09:45,364 --> 01:09:47,559
He's bathing outside, madame.

465
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,897
What do you mean, outside?

466
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,765
In the boys' area, madame.

467
01:10:03,549 --> 01:10:04,846
I'll do it, madame.

468
01:10:04,884 --> 01:10:07,648
No, never mind.

469
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:12,419
The sheets and pillow cases
need changing.

470
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,758
All done?

471
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,470
Look! Move over.

472
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:39,178
We need two more meters.
Rip these out and flatten it.

473
01:10:39,218 --> 01:10:40,515
They're madam's flowers.

474
01:10:40,553 --> 01:10:42,521
You want to play?

475
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:47,254
Don't argue. It's the only spot
where we can play in the shade.

476
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,657
"Amidst bronzed
black African faces...

477
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:57,726
"the white skin color evokes
something akin to death."

478
01:11:00,306 --> 01:11:03,002
"In 1891, I, myself,

479
01:11:03,209 --> 01:11:06,872
"having seen only colored
people for months..."

480
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:09,278
What is it, Prot�e?

481
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:11,749
I'm bringing
lemon squash, madame.

482
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:19,451
"In 1891, I, myself,
having seen only..."

483
01:11:21,427 --> 01:11:23,361
Put the tray down, Prot�e.

484
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,696
"In 1891, I, myself...

485
01:11:31,737 --> 01:11:36,697
"having seen only
colored people for months...

487
01:11:40,412 --> 01:11:42,812
"I found white skin unnatural...

488
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,042
"next to the fullness
of black skin."

489
01:11:47,753 --> 01:11:50,847
"Then why blame the natives
for considering the white man...

490
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:55,394

491
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:58,022
"as a supernatural
or fiendish creature?"

492
01:12:05,871 --> 01:12:07,429
Aim or shoot!

493
01:12:30,362 --> 01:12:32,489
It's a "bird head!"

494
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:35,625
Prot�e, go and get
the pickup, please.

495
01:12:39,972 --> 01:12:43,533
What are you doing here?
Not in bed?

496
01:12:45,377 --> 01:12:46,810
She's swallowing her tongue.

497
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:48,574
Put a spoon in her mouth.

498
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,082
Let's get Prosper
from the village.

499
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:53,550
With a spoon, honey.

500
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,728
He's at the school
with the teacher.

501
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,599
His wife gave me his case.

502
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,337
What do they do at night
at the school?

503
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:20,641
They're talking, sir.

504
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:23,614
Yes, I know.

505
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,562
Prosper!

506
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:47,698
Prosper, come quickly!

507
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:56,170
I need you.
I have your case.

508
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:17,902
Where's my wife?

509
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:20,905
At Mrs. Machinard's bedside.

510
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:24,397
Prosper, it's the room
on the right. Thank you.

511
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:27,208
Prot�e's starting
the generator.

512
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:34,976
Prosper treated us all.

513
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,011
So we're saved, Dalens.

514
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,046
We're saved.

515
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,128
It isn't possible, Dalens.

516
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,604
Have you no one else
who can treat her?

517
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:55,470
Are you serious, Machinard?

518
01:14:56,975 --> 01:15:00,001
- I'm leaving, sir.
- I'll walk you.

519
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:03,047
I wouldn't mind, but my wife
needs a real doctor.

520
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,049
I pity you.

521
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,710
The car's coming
early tomorrow.

522
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,050
You'll be in Yaound� soon.

523
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,078
Dirty nigger!

524
01:15:12,124 --> 01:15:14,558
You're a doctor?

525
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:18,461
You're not good enough
to wipe a white man's ass.

526
01:15:18,497 --> 01:15:20,192
Well, I understand, Mireille.

527
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,666
That's the way
to speak to them.

528
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:25,693
All right, all right.

529
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:27,967
Leave him alone, Segalen.

530
01:15:28,006 --> 01:15:31,032
Oh, I forgot
the loop-the-loop king.

531
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,743
You make me sick.

532
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:39,046
Andr�, I don't feel well.

533
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,948
One can't say a word

534
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:45,650
without being accused
of the worst things.

535
01:15:48,594 --> 01:15:51,893
A nice trio, Dalens! You,
your wife, and the parasite.

536
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,295
I'm just discussing!

537
01:15:53,499 --> 01:15:56,559
All right, that's enough.

538
01:15:56,602 --> 01:16:01,198
Prosper, yop-la-boom,
he's the man all the ladies seek

539
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:05,609
Prosper, yop-la-boom, he's
the king of the street

540
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:33,233
One day, we'll get
kicked out of here.

541
01:17:12,644 --> 01:17:14,111
Good luck.

542
01:17:40,339 --> 01:17:42,967
This is the boys' shower.

543
01:17:48,847 --> 01:17:51,213
Prot�e...

544
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:53,719
you're a pain.

545
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:57,883
Aim�e, it's the most beautiful
bathroom in the world.

546
01:18:08,233 --> 01:18:12,636
In French, most words
ending in "e"

547
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:14,662
are feminine.

548
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:21,307
However, some masculine words
end in a silent "e."

549
01:18:41,433 --> 01:18:44,197
Go ahead, Prot�e.

550
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:46,796
I don't observe Ramadan.

551
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:51,000
What's the matter?

552
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:56,106
The boss said to tell you
the truck from Douala is here.

553
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,274
It's the propeller.

554
01:19:00,118 --> 01:19:01,380
Let's go.

555
01:19:03,288 --> 01:19:06,780
Our dear Dalens can't wait
until we leave.

556
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:10,124
The runway is almost finished...

557
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,857
but let me point out...

558
01:19:11,897 --> 01:19:14,832
that if the rains are
slightly early this year...

559
01:19:14,866 --> 01:19:19,428
we're back to square one
for at least 4 months.

560
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,444
Prot�e, please bring the fruit.

561
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:48,931
A half?

562
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:50,161
Gladly.

563
01:19:54,339 --> 01:19:58,173
Listen to the night sounds.
Listen carefully.

564
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:17,328
It's deadly.

565
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,230
Don't exaggerate.

566
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,323
Aim�e...

567
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,261
I've decided not to eat
with your guests anymore.

568
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:33,633
You think I enjoy squatting
between Enoch, who rambles on,

569
01:21:33,839 --> 01:21:36,467
and Prot�e, who pouts?

570
01:21:41,213 --> 01:21:43,204
Right, Prot�e?

571
01:21:58,463 --> 01:22:01,057
Say it bothers you
that I'm here.

572
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,970
No?

573
01:22:11,309 --> 01:22:13,209
Well...

574
01:22:13,245 --> 01:22:15,213
I think he's mute.

575
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:23,480
Actually, Aim�e...

576
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:27,423
you'd like to be in my place,
rubbing against Prot�e.

577
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:33,694
Come, I'll make room
for you.

578
01:22:39,437 --> 01:22:41,029
No?

579
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:54,617
Madame?

580
01:22:54,653 --> 01:22:57,918
Thank you, Prot�e.
I don't need anything.

581
01:23:26,484 --> 01:23:29,044
Beat it.
Leave me alone.

582
01:23:36,294 --> 01:23:39,195
Must I repeat it,
you son of a bitch?

583
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:50,539
What? You don't like it?

584
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:58,378
Fuck off! Go lick the boots
of your bosses.

585
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:03,743
You're worse than the priests
who raised you.

586
01:26:22,861 --> 01:26:26,228
You still want to know
what the horizon is?

587
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,832
Are you asleep?

588
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:39,806
When you look
at the hills...

589
01:26:39,844 --> 01:26:43,371
beyond the houses
and beyond the trees...

590
01:26:43,414 --> 01:26:46,815
where the earth
touches the sky...

591
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:48,682
that's the horizon.

592
01:26:51,222 --> 01:26:54,385
Tomorrow, in the daytime,
I'll show you something.

593
01:27:00,331 --> 01:27:04,165
The closer you get to that line,
the farther it moves.

594
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:11,834
If you walk towards it,
it moves away.

595
01:27:11,876 --> 01:27:13,673
It flees from you.

596
01:27:16,548 --> 01:27:18,743
I must also explain
this to you.

597
01:27:22,687 --> 01:27:24,951
You see the line.

598
01:27:26,925 --> 01:27:29,587
You see it,
but it doesn't exist.

599
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:46,810
Do you want some chocolate?

600
01:27:47,812 --> 01:27:50,280
No, too early.

601
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,394
Thank you, Prot�e.

602
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:23,271
You're here.

603
01:28:26,618 --> 01:28:28,381
Luc left?

604
01:28:34,492 --> 01:28:36,016
Yes?

605
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,652
Yes, he left.

606
01:28:39,864 --> 01:28:41,422
Without saying anything?

607
01:28:43,334 --> 01:28:45,359
Why didn't you wake me up?

608
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:50,399
You always get taken in, Marc.

609
01:28:56,314 --> 01:28:58,839
I'd rather Prot�e
stopped working in the house.

610
01:28:59,884 --> 01:29:03,479
Put him where you like...
somewhere else.

611
01:29:04,522 --> 01:29:06,387
Prot�e's very good.

612
01:29:07,392 --> 01:29:08,859
Please, Marc.

613
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,893
He'll work in the garage.

614
01:32:00,731 --> 01:32:02,892
Does it burn?

615
01:32:56,787 --> 01:32:58,618
Aim�e.

616
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,590
Have a good trip.

617
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:01,853
Thank you.

618
01:33:03,294 --> 01:33:05,228
Good-bye, Dalens.

619
01:33:30,955 --> 01:33:35,756
No, it'll never fit.
See the size of my door?

620
01:33:35,793 --> 01:33:38,956
Let's go. All aboard.
Forget the organ.

621
01:33:38,996 --> 01:33:42,625
You two. Move this thing.
It's in the way.

622
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:43,964
Let's go!

623
01:33:51,976 --> 01:33:53,967
I'll come back.

624
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,953
My son's name is Sawa.
His mother's a Sawa.

625
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,750
I'm Mungo.

626
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:48,122
Mungo is a nickname
they gave me here.

627
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:52,687
My real name
is William J. Park.

628
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,198
I'm an American negro.

629
01:35:57,134 --> 01:35:59,432
You're not disappointed?

630
01:36:01,072 --> 01:36:03,905
Were you looking
for a real native?

631
01:36:05,409 --> 01:36:10,073
Your son's asleep. He'd be
more comfortable in the back.

632
01:36:10,114 --> 01:36:11,411
Do you mind?

633
01:36:12,416 --> 01:36:14,407
I want a Fanta.

634
01:36:14,452 --> 01:36:17,421
OK, man,
we'll stop for one.

635
01:36:20,357 --> 01:36:24,885
I remember the day
I arrived in Africa.

636
01:36:24,929 --> 01:36:27,295
I was totally drunk.

637
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:33,964
In customs, I felt like kissing
the officers, my brothers.

638
01:36:34,972 --> 01:36:37,065
I told myself...

639
01:36:37,108 --> 01:36:40,475
"That's it, man, you're home."

640
01:36:42,913 --> 01:36:45,438
I kept my sweater on.

641
01:36:45,483 --> 01:36:50,250
I didn't even realize
I was dripping with sweat.

642
01:36:52,156 --> 01:36:57,150
I got ripped off at the airport
by the first cabbie.

643
01:36:58,996 --> 01:37:03,433
He didn't give a damn
that I was black.

644
01:37:05,035 --> 01:37:08,198
He was probably right.

645
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,231
Brothers here, brothers there.

646
01:37:13,978 --> 01:37:16,378
Yeah...

647
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:20,315
I really stayed American.

648
01:37:22,386 --> 01:37:26,083
They don't give a shit
about guys like me here.

649
01:37:27,224 --> 01:37:29,089
Here, I'm nothing.

650
01:37:30,027 --> 01:37:32,086
I'm dreaming.

651
01:37:32,129 --> 01:37:36,998
If I died now,
I'd disappear totally.

652
01:37:40,137 --> 01:37:42,002
You don't say much.

653
01:37:43,174 --> 01:37:45,802
I've hung around Douala
for two weeks.

654
01:37:45,843 --> 01:37:49,438
I should be heading north.
I have my ticket.

655
01:37:50,514 --> 01:37:52,539
You know people there?

656
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,813
No.

657
01:37:54,852 --> 01:37:57,582
There's a house
I'd like to see again...

658
01:37:57,621 --> 01:37:59,350
but I don't know.

659
01:38:11,869 --> 01:38:14,303
I'll come back
around 10:00?

660
01:38:14,338 --> 01:38:15,896
Suit yourself.

661
01:38:29,386 --> 01:38:34,289
That's my wife. Now I live
alone. I was a big pain.

662
01:38:39,363 --> 01:38:41,024
Where to?

663
01:38:41,065 --> 01:38:43,295
To the Novotel, please.

664
01:38:49,206 --> 01:38:50,935
Thank you.

665
01:38:51,976 --> 01:38:54,536
Give me your hand.

666
01:38:54,578 --> 01:38:58,480
I'll tell you if you should
go see your house.

667
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:03,350
Your palm is strange.
Can't see anything.

668
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,086
Let's have a drink.

669
01:39:16,233 --> 01:39:19,259
I don't think so, babe.

670
01:39:20,671 --> 01:39:24,607
Leave quickly
before they eat you up. Bye.
