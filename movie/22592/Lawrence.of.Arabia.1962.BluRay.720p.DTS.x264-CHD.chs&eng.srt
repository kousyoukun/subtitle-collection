1
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,511
他是我认识的人当中 最不平凡的一个人
He was the most extraordinary man I ever knew.

2
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,805
你跟他很熟吗？
Did you know him well?

3
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,682
我认识他
I knew him.

4
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:05,749
你要不就是跟他很熟 要不就是不认识他
Well, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,939
但他真的值得…
But did he really deserve...

6
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,441
你们把他葬在这里吗？
a place in here?

7
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:28,272
艾伦比爵士 你能谈谈劳伦斯上校吗？
Lord Allenby, could you give a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,462
什么？还要再说啊？
What, more words?

9
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,216
沙漠的叛乱事件…
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,074
在中东局势中 扮演着决定性的角色
played a decisive part in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,994
是的，但我想请您 谈谈劳伦斯上校这个人
Yes, sir, but about Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:45,582
不，我跟他不熟，你知道的
No, no. I didn't know him well, you know.

13
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,943
班特尼先生，你可说是最认识劳伦斯
Mr. Bentley, you know as much about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:54,863
是的，能认识他…
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:57,782
跟让世人认识他，是我的荣幸
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:02,266
他是诗人，学者及英勇的战士
He was a poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:03,726
谢谢
Thank you.

18
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,627
他还是自从巴纳姆跟贝利之后 最无耻的爱现狂
He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,712
您是哪位？
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,215
我是杰克森班特利
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:17,595
我听到你刚说的话 并对那提出最严重的异议
I overheard your last remark and take the gravest exception.

22
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,097
-他是个伟大的人 -你认识他吗？
- He was a great man. - Did you know him?

23
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:22,391
不，我不能说我认识他
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:25,102
我很荣幸在大马士革跟他握过手
I had the honour to shake his hand in Damascus.

25
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:26,875
认识他？我从来都不认识他
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,629
他曾在开罗为我做些不重要工作
He had some minor function on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:51,901
麦克乔治哈特利
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:55,551
这是个又脏又暗的小房间
this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:56,802
没错
That's right.

30
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,200
我们在这里不快乐
We are not happy in it.

31
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:03,371
我快乐，这要比待在 又脏又暗的的小战壕来得好
I am. It's better than a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:07,021
-那么你是个高尚的贵族罗 -没错
- Then you're a big noble fellow. - That's right.

33
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:12,235
威廉波特拿着我的报纸来了
Here is William Potter with my newspaper.

34
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:14,946
-拿去吧 -谢谢
- Here you are, Tosh. - Thanks.

35
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:20,160
你想来根哈特利上校的香烟吗？
Would you care for one of Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:23,914
-有刊登吗？ -当然有
- Is it there? - Of course.

37
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:25,686
头条新闻
Headlines.

38
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,545
我敢说泰晤士时报 一定没提这条新闻
But I bet it isn't mentioned in the Times.

39
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,341
“贝都因人攻击土耳其要塞”
" Bedouin tribes attack Turkish stronghold."

40
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:39,242
我敢说连这里总部的人 都不知道这件事
I bet that no one in this headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,100
或者在乎这件事，我来帮你点烟
Or would care if it did. Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:47,897
-劳伦斯先生？ -我就是
- Mr. Lawrence? - Yes.

43
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,191
-您的电报 -谢谢
- Flimsy, sir. - Thank you.

44
00:10:57,178 --> 00:11:00,514
你总有一次会闯祸的 只不过是血肉罢了
You'll do that once too often. It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,538
麦克乔治哈特利 你是个哲学家
Michael George Hartley, you're a philosopher.

46
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:05,624
你是个怪人！
And you're balmy!

47
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,725
-好痛啊！ -当然会痛罗
- It damn well hurts! - Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:24,706
那么秘诀是什么？
What's the trick, then?

49
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,982
威廉波特 秘诀就是不要在乎会痛
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,214
还有如果吉普森上尉要找我
By the way, if Captain Gibbon should enquire for me...

51
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:35,864
告诉他我去跟将军聊天了
tell him I've gone for a chat with the general.

52
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,826
-他是个怪人 -他还好
- He's balmy. - He's all right.

53
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,334
劳伦斯
Lawrence.

54
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,211
什么事？
Yes?

55
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:51,296
你应该要…
You're supposed to be...

56
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:54,112
你通常都是这样乱糟糟地戴着 帽子进来这里的吗？
Do you usually wear your cap in the mess?

57
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,197
我一直都是这样
Always.

58
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:58,387
你应该在当班 你要去哪里？
You should be on duty. Where are you going?

59
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,994
别跟我说教 佛莱迪，这里是食堂啊
Mustn't talk shop, Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:03,184
我要去跟将军谈一谈
I'm going for a powwow with the general.

61
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:06,938
我不是以长官的身份问你 而是食堂负责人身份在问你
I'm not asking as your superior, but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,649
我们不要该在当班的人进来
We don't want chaps in here who should be on duty.

63
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,317
请告诉我，你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

64
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:16,114
我得警告你，劳伦斯！
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:19,138
-抱歉 -你是个小丑，劳伦斯
- Sorry. - You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,788
不可能人人都是驯兽师
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:26,437
抱歉
Sorry.

68
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,253
真是个谜，戴登
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,694
我不建议让一个自大愚蠢的中尉
I do not propose to let an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:36,448
对指挥官的命令不屑一顾 而且还不受到惩罚
thumb his nose at his commander and get away with it.

71
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,889
听起来没有他不是任何大损失
It doesn't sound as though he'd be any great loss.

72
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,538
别那么做，戴登，这是原则问题
Don't try that, Dryden. There's a principle involved.

73
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,311
没错
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,501
他待在开罗一点用处都没有
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,838
他或许该到阿拉伯去 他清楚时事，长官
He might be in Arabia. He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:52,610
你是说他书看得多吧
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:55,947
我已经派布莱顿上校去了 他是一位真正的战士
I've already sent out Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,867
如果布莱顿认为我们该出兵 我们会那么做的
If Brighton thinks we should send some arms, we will.

79
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,829
你还需要什么？
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:06,166
你确定劳伦斯中尉…
That there would be no question of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,252
不会给任何军事上的建议
giving military advice.

82
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:10,441
天啊，我希望他不会那么做
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:15,238
只是 （军情总局） 阿拉伯局 希望有自己的人在现场…
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like its own man on the spot to...

84
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,385
做什么？
To what?

85
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:19,200
对当前形势作一个评估
To make our own appraisal of the situation.

86
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:23,476
我还要告诉你 这是我跟我手下的意见
I'll tell you, it's my considered opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,500
任何花在贝都因人身上的时间 都是浪费了的时间
that time spent on the Bedouin will be time wasted.

88
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,107
他们是一个偷羊贼的民族
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:32,339
他们的确攻击了麦地纳
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,842
土耳其人把他们打的粉身碎骨
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.

91
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,406
我们不知道这件事
We don't know that.

92
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:40,994
我们知道他们没接受 那没什么，只是段小插曲
We know that they didn't take it. A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:45,791
如果你想听我的意见 我觉得这儿根本是个小插曲
In my opinion, this whole theatre of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,440
真正的战争敌人是德国人 不是土耳其人
The real war's being fought against Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:52,569
战场不在这里而是在西线
Not here, but on the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:55,384
你的贝都因军队 不管他们是如何称呼自己
Your Bedouin Army, or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,991
他们只不过是一段小插曲中的小配角
would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,911
伟大的事都是 从很小的开端开始的，长官
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,290
 （军情总局） 阿拉伯局希望阿拉伯发生大事吗？
Does the Arab Bureau want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:09,774
在战争结束后 他们会臣服于我们之下吗？
Does the bureau think they'll sit down under us when this war is over?

101
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:15,092
长官，局里认为 现在的工作是要打胜仗
The bureau thinks the job of the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,012
别告诉我我有什么责任，戴登先生
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,036
-劳伦斯来了，长官 -请他进来
- Lawrence, sir. - Send him in.

104
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:24,164
早安
Good morning, sir.

105
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:25,832
敬礼
Salute.

106
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:31,463
如果你要抗命，我会逮捕你的
If you're insubordinate, I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,444
-是我的态度 -你的什么？
- It's my manner. - Your what?

108
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:36,573
长官，我的态度看来像是抗命 但事实上却不然
My manner. It looks insubordinate, but it isn't.

109
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,744
我弄不清楚 你是态度恶劣或是愚蠢
I can't make out whether you're bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:43,872
-我也有相同的问题，长官 -闭嘴
- I have the same problem, sir. - Shut up.

111
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:47,522
 （军情总局） 阿拉伯局认为你在阿拉伯 应该会派上用场了
The Arab Bureau thinks you would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,399
我真想不到什么原因
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:52,110
你无法完成你现在的任务
You can't perform your present duties properly.

114
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:57,115
“我不会拉提琴，但我能让一个 小城市变成一个伟大的国家”
" I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great state from a little city."

115
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:59,722
-什么？ -那是希米斯特克拉斯的话
- What? - Themistocles, sir.

116
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:03,580
-他是希腊的哲学家 -我知道你受过高深的教育
- A Greek philosopher. - I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:06,083
你的档案上是那么说的
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,401
你是我受不了的那种人 劳伦斯
You're the kind of creature I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,885
但我想我可能错了
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,221
好了，戴丹 你可以把他带走六星期
All right, Dryden. You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,975
谁知道呢？或许可以把他 变成男子汉，进来！
Who knows? It might even make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:26,208
什么事？
Yes, what is it?

123
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,232
舰队明天晚上会到赛德港
The convoy will be in Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,526
-确定了吗？ -是的，长官
- Is that certain? - Yes, sir.

125
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,863
看来似乎没有大炮
There doesn't seem to be any artillery.

126
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,782
但应该要有才对啊！
But there must be artillery!

127
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:44,247
长官，他要去很远的地方
Sir, this is something of an expedition.

128
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:44,456
<font size=20 color=#00d8f8><b>延布（Yenbo）：沙特阿拉伯重要商港
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide, find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:48,418
他得到延布去找向导 找到阿拉伯人然后回来

130
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:51,338
他在六星期内是办不到的

只要阿拉伯的部族战争不休

242

愿真主与你同在，英国人

258
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:38,304
当我自力地走在波斯迪波兰尼

259
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:40,493

他怎么会知道？
How did he know?

266

方圆五十里发生的事 没有一件是费萨尔不知道的
Not much happens within 50 miles of Feisal that he doesn't know.

267
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:59,013

I'll give him that. No escort?

268
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:02,037

- Turks? - No, an Arab.

270
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:07,459
残忍的野蛮人
Bloody savages.

271
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,360
-这里是万迪沙法拉，对吧？ -对，他们在那边
- This is Wadi Saf ra, isn't it? - Yes, they're over there.

272
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:15,175
等一下，你叫什么名字？ 是谁派你来的？
Just a minute. What's your name and who sent you?

273
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:19,451
我是劳伦斯 我隶属于（军情总局） 阿拉伯局
Lawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab Bureau.

274
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:24,456
你在为（军情总局） 阿拉伯局做什么？
What are you to do for the Arab Bureau?

275
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:29,670
不是很清楚 我是来了解这儿的状况
Well, it's rather vague, sir. I'm to appreciate the situation.

276
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,258
那一点都不难，情况非常可怕
Well, that won't be difficult. The situation's bloody awf ul.

277
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:37,595
他们的士气 我怀疑他们是否有士气
Their morale, if they ever had any, which I doubt...

278
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:41,870
土耳其人在麦地纳前 用榴弹炮击溃了他们
the Turks knocked out of them in front of Medina, with howitzers.

279
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:44,581
他们每晚都有好几十个跑掉
They're fading away by dozens every night.

280
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:46,354
这是我想说的：
What I want to say is this:

281
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:49,273
不管你在哪里 还有你跟谁在一起
Wherever you are and whoever you are with...

282
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:51,359
你仍是英国军官，这是命令
you're a British officer. Here's an order.

283
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:55,634
当我们进入营地时 你得把嘴巴闭上
When we get into that camp, you're to keep your mouth shut.

284
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:59,492
-你知道我在说什么吗？ -我知道你在说什么
- Do you understand what I'm saying? - I understand what you're saying.

285
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:02,621
你了解好了以后就回到…
You'll make your appreciation and get back to--

286
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:07,000
天啊
Oh, my God.

287
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,503
别又来了
Not again.

288
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:41,515
我告诉过他了 天知道，我告诉过他了
I've told him! God knows I've told him.

289
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:44,852
我说“往南走 你还在射击范围内”
" Move South, " I've said. "You're still in range."

290
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:50,379
他们根本不了解 现在武器的威力！
They simply will not understand what modern weapons do!

291
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:20,306
挺身而战！
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

292
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:26,875
向他们还击！
Fire back at them.

293
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:42,058
-你是谁？ -劳伦斯中尉，长官
- Who are you? - Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

294
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,039
我隶属于（军情总局） 阿拉伯局
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

295
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:47,480
这真的是一团乱 我们真的得往南走
This is a bloody mess, sir. We'll have to move south.

296
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:50,087
是的，上校，往南走五十里
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

297
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,215
你说的对，我错了
You were right and I was wrong.

298
00:40:53,528 --> 00:40:55,509
我们得想想如何处理伤者
We must take some thought for the wounded.

299
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:59,055
-我们可以到延布帮他们疗伤 -只要他们到得了延布
- We can take care of them at Yenbo. - lf they can get to Yenbo.

300
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:00,827
他们不可能跟我们一起走
They can hardly come with us.

301
00:41:01,244 --> 00:41:05,207
不，他们得试着到延布去 那个…？
No. They must try to reach Yenbo. Lieutenant...?

302
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:07,397
劳伦斯
Lawrence.

303
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:10,108
你明白的，劳伦斯中尉
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence...

304
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:15,426
我的人不习惯炸药跟机器
my people are unused to explosives and machines.

305
00:41:16,051 --> 00:41:19,910
先是枪，现在又是这个
First the guns, and now this.

306
00:42:14,654 --> 00:42:15,801
有香烟吗？
Cigarette?

307
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:17,470
抱歉
I'm sorry.

308
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:30,087
有烟吗？殿下
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

309
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,277
走开
Umph off.

310
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:36,031
拜托，殿下 就给我们两个人一根烟？
Please, Your Excellency. Just one for two?

311
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,904
等一下，贾金斯！
Hold it, Jenkins!

312
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:00,744
贾金斯！
Jenkins!

313
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,693
劳伦斯？
Lawrence?

314
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,447
你没有带随从
You have no servant.

315
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:18,262
-我不需要随从 -是吗？
- I don't need a servant. - No?

316
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:22,224
我们什么都会做 生火，煮食物，洗衣服
We can do everything. Light fires, cook food, wash clothes.

317
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:24,414
-对，什么都会做 -我不怀疑
- Yes, everything. - I don't doubt it.

318
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:27,855
-那对你来说是件好事 -我负担不起
- It will be very nice for you. - I can't afford it.

319
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:51,109
那么尽可能地朗读古兰经吧
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.

320
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:59,242
天知道你们当中有些病人
God knoweth that there be some among you sick...

321
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:05,499
其他人在世界到处旅行 寻找真主的恩赐
while others travel through the Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

322
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:10,921
其他人为他而战
Others do battle in His cause.

323
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:15,509
所以尽可能地朗读吧
Recite, therefore, as much as may be easy.

324
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:19,055
服从经文
And observe the prayers.

325
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:25,728
这将会是最好 最丰硕的报答
This will be best and richest in the recompense.

326
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:30,838
寻求真主的宽恕
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

327
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:36,573
真主是会原谅你 他是那么地仁慈…
Verily, God is forgiving, mercif ul--

328
00:44:36,886 --> 00:44:38,554
你好啊，阿里
Greetings, Ali.

329
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:40,327
-殿下 -阿里长官
- My lord. - Sherif Ali.

330
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,602
劳伦斯中尉 我想你见过阿里长官了
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met Sherif Ali, I think.

331
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:47,417
是的，殿下
Yes, my lord.

332
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,214
这是赛林姆的“光明”
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

333
00:44:52,527 --> 00:44:54,717
“经由中午的光明”
" By the noonday brightness...

334
00:44:55,134 --> 00:44:57,115
“跟天黑后的夜晚”
and by the night when it darkeneth...

335
00:44:57,532 --> 00:44:59,826
“真主是不会遗弃你的”
thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

336
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:02,537
“他也不会不悦”
neither hath He been displeased.

337
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,813
“你的未来当然比过去好”
And surely the future shall be better for thee than the past."

338
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,775
“在最后真主 将会慷慨地赐福于你”
"And in the end shall your Lord be bounteous to thee...

339
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:13,278
“而你将会满足”
and thou be satisfied."

340
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:16,614
那么？
So?

341
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:19,847
是的，上校
Yes, colonel.

342
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:23,914
-我要你做决定，长官 -你要我撤退回延布
- I want a decision, sir. - You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

343
00:45:24,227 --> 00:45:26,833
你在这里没有大用途
Well, you're not doing much good here, sir.

344
00:45:27,146 --> 00:45:31,004
我很抱歉这么说 但在这里我们不能为你提供补给
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we can't supply you here.

345
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:33,194
你可以从亚喀巴港来补给我们！
You could supply us through Aqaba!

346
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:35,071
亚喀巴！
Aqaba!

347
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:38,929
如果你守得住亚喀巴 我们就能给你补给
If you can get ahold of Aqaba, we can supply you.

348
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:40,911
-但是你们不能！ -你们可以的
- But you can't! - You could.

349
00:45:41,432 --> 00:45:43,935
你是指海军吗？
You mean, the navy?

350
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:48,210
土耳其人在亚喀巴 部署了十二寸的大炮
The Turks have 12-inch guns at Aqaba, sir.

351
00:45:48,523 --> 00:45:50,400
你可以想像那是什么意思吗？
Can you imagine what that means?

352
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:52,277
对，我想像得到
Yes, I can imagine.

353
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:56,656
别想了，海军还有别的事要做
Put that out of your mind, sir. The navy's got other things to do.

354
00:45:57,073 --> 00:45:59,472
对，保护苏伊士运河
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

355
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,955
前线最重要的地方就是运河
The one essential sector of this front is and must be the canal.

356
00:46:04,373 --> 00:46:06,041
你应该明白的
You can see that, sir, surely.

357
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:09,273
我知道英国人对运河有兴趣
I see that the canal is an essential British interest.

358
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:11,463
那对我们来说没什么影响
It is of little consequence to us.

359
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:14,070
请你不要那么说
I must ask you not to speak like that.

360
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:16,886
英国跟阿拉伯的目标是一样的
British and Arab interests are one and the same.

361
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,910
有可能
Possibly.

362
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,872
我得说，先生，你很不知感激
Upon my word, sir, you're ungratef ul.

363
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,896
撤退回延布 我们会补充设备给你的
Fall back on Yenbo and we will give you equipment.

364
00:46:26,896 --> 00:46:29,086
给你武器，建议，训练 什么都可以
Give you arms, advice, training, everything.

365
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:32,214
-枪呢？ -每个人都能有现代的来福枪
- Guns? - A modern rifle for every man.

366
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:35,342
不，枪，大炮
No. Guns. Artillery.

367
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,783
像是土耳其人在麦地纳用的大炮
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

368
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,120
对，给我们大炮，不用训练我们
Yes, give us guns and keep the training.

369
00:46:42,537 --> 00:46:46,083
你的手下 最需要的是训练而不是大炮
Your men need training far more than guns, sir.

370
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:48,064
英国人要教 贝都因人如何战斗？
English will teach Bedu to fight?

371
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:52,339
阿里长官，我们会教他们 对抗一只现代化的机械式军队
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight a modern mechanized army.

372
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:58,074
是的，中尉？ 延布的事你意见如何？
Yes, lieutenant? What do you think about Yenbo?

373
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:04,852
我觉得那里离大马士革很远
I think it is far from Damascus.

374
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:08,398
我们会把你送到大马士革的，别害怕
We'll have you in Damascus, sir. Never fear.

375
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:11,734
你去过大马士革吗？劳伦斯先生
Have you been in Damascus, Mr. Lawrence?

376
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,716
去过，殿下
Yes, my lord.

377
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:16,322
那里很漂亮，对吧？
It is beautif ul, is it not?

378
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,304
-非常漂亮 -那就行了，劳伦斯
- Very. - That will do, Lawrence.

379
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:22,579
梦想不会带你去大马士革 但是纪律可以
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus, but discipline will.

380
00:47:22,996 --> 00:47:27,897
听着，英国是一个小国家 比你的国家还小
Look, Great Britain is a small country, much smaller than yours.

381
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,712
跟某些国家相比人口很少
Small population compared with some.

382
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:33,841
它很小但很伟大，为什么？
It's small, but it's great. And why?

383
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:36,969
-因为它有枪 -因为它有纪律
- Because it has guns. - Because it has discipline.

384
00:47:37,178 --> 00:47:39,472
因为它有海军，所以…
Because it has a navy, because of this, the English go where they please...

385
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,349
英国人想去哪里都行

386
00:47:41,766 --> 00:47:44,268
想攻击哪里都没问题 所以他们才会很伟大
and strike where they please. This makes them great.

387
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:46,562
-对 -劳伦斯先生，那样就行了
- Right. - Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

388
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,169
劳伦斯不是你的军事顾问
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

389
00:47:49,378 --> 00:47:51,463
但我想听听他的意见
But I would like to hear his opinion.

390
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,174
该死！ 你听谁的命令呢？
Damn it! Who do you take your orders from?

391
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:57,720
在费萨尔的帐篷里 当然是费萨尔殿下
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

392
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:03,246
老笨蛋！为什么问完他后问他 他们一个是主人，一个是随从
Old fool! Why turn from him to him? They are master and man.

393
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:08,043
殿下，我认为…
My lord, I think...

394
00:48:08,982 --> 00:48:11,171
我认为你的书说的对
I think your book is right.

395
00:48:11,484 --> 00:48:15,655
沙漠是个没有船的海洋
The desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped.

396
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:18,158
在这片海洋中贝都因人…
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they please and strike where they please.

397
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:19,930
想去哪里，想攻击那里都行

398
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:22,433
贝都因人一直是这样作战的
This is the way the Bedu has always fought.

399
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:25,561
你因这个战法而名闻世界
You're famed through the world for fighting this way.

400
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:27,960
你现在正需要这样打法
And this is the way you should fight now.

401
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,732
我不知道
I don't know.

402
00:48:30,149 --> 00:48:32,235
抱歉，先生，你错了
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

403
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:37,449
撤退回延布，阿拉伯提升组织 将成为英军的一个单位
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising becomes one unit in the British army.

404
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:39,534
-对你来说这有什么好处？ -你是个叛徒
- What is this to you? - You're a traitor.

405
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,828
不，上校
No, colonel.

406
00:48:42,141 --> 00:48:45,374
他是个年轻人，年轻人充满了热忱
He is a young man, and young men are passionate.

407
00:48:45,582 --> 00:48:48,710
他们得说出想说的话
They must say their say.

408
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:54,863
但聪明人得下决定 我知道你是对的
But wiser people must decide. I know you are right.

409
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:57,678
那么，我们何时走？越快越好
Very well. When shall we move? The sooner the better.

410
00:48:57,887 --> 00:49:00,389
你今晚会失去五十个手下
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

411
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,456
你的语气很强硬
You tread heavily...

412
00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:08,106
但你说的话都是真的
but you speak the truth.

413
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:13,215
我明天会告诉你答案 但是现在…
I will give you my answer tomorrow. And now...

414
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:15,405
已经很晚了
it is late.

415
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:33,966
布莱顿上校想把我的人…
Colonel Brighton means to put my men under European officers, does he not?

416
00:49:33,966 --> 00:49:36,781
纳入欧洲军官麾下，对吧？

417
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,867
可以说，是的
In effect, my lord, yes.

418
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,161
我必须这么做
And I must do it...

419
00:49:41,682 --> 00:49:45,436
因为土耳其人有欧洲人的枪
because the Turks have European guns.

420
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:48,356
但我害怕这么做
But I fear to do it...

421
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:51,484
我以灵魂发誓，我真的怕
upon my soul I do.

422
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,532
英国人对荒凉之地比较有兴趣
The English have a great hunger for desolate places.

423
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:00,973
我怕他们想拿下阿拉伯
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

424
00:50:01,286 --> 00:50:03,267
那你得挺身抵抗
Then you must deny it to them.

425
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,021
你是英国人，你不忠于英国吗？
You are an Englishman. Are you not Ioyal to England?

426
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:10,671
我效忠于英国跟其他事情
To England and to other things.

427
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:13,486
你同时效忠于英国跟阿拉伯？
To England and Arabia both?

428
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:15,572
那可能吗？
And is that possible?

429
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:26,208
我觉得你是 那种喜欢沙漠的英国人
I think you are another of these desert-Ioving English.

430
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:26,729
<font size=20 color=#00d8f8><b>两人都是到过中东沙漠的英国旅行家
Doughty, Stanhope...

432

Gordon of Khartoum.

喀土穆的戈登

434
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:34,237
阿拉伯人不喜欢沙漠
No Arab loves the desert.

435
00:50:34,654 --> 00:50:39,555
我们喜欢水跟绿树 在沙漠里什么都没有
We love water and green trees. There is nothing in the desert.

436
00:50:40,598 --> 00:50:42,996
人都是有需求的
And no man needs nothing.

437
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:49,774
或是你们觉得 我们是你们能玩弄的东西
Or is it that you think we are something you can play with...

438
00:50:50,087 --> 00:50:53,528
因为我们是弱小愚蠢的民族
because we are a little people, a silly people...

439
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:57,803
贪婪，野蛮又残忍？
greedy, barbarous and cruel?

440
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:01,661
中尉，你知道 在阿拉伯的卡杜巴市…
Or do you know, lieutenant, in the Arab city of Cordoba...

441
00:51:01,974 --> 00:51:04,373
有两里长的街道设有路灯
were two miles of lighting in the streets...

442
00:51:04,685 --> 00:51:06,249
当时伦敦还只是个小村子
when London was a village.

443
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:09,378
对，你们很伟大
Yes, you were great.

444
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:11,776
那是九世纪前的事
Nine centuries ago.

445
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:14,174
该是你们恢复光荣的时候了，殿下
Time to be great again, my lord.

446
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:17,616
所以我父亲 决定对土耳其人发动战争
Which is why my father made this war upon the Turks.

447
00:51:17,928 --> 00:51:21,682
劳伦斯先生，是我父亲 不是英国人
My father, Mr. Lawrence, not the English.

448
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:25,123
但我父亲老了
But my father is old...

449
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,834
而我…
and I...

450
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,257
我渴望着废弃的卡杜巴花园
I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba.

451
00:51:35,238 --> 00:51:38,158
然而在得到花园前 得先经历苦战
However, before the gardens must come the fighting.

452
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:43,371
要再度恢复光荣 看起来我们需要英国人
To be great again, it seems that we need the English...

453
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:44,623
或是…
or...

454
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,291
或是？
Or?

455
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:50,462
没有人能提供的东西 劳伦斯先生
What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence.

456
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:53,173
我们需要奇迹
We need a miracle.

457
00:54:58,471 --> 00:54:59,409
亚喀巴
Aqaba.

458
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:04,310
亚喀巴
Aqaba.

459
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:06,813
从陆地进攻
From the land.

460
00:55:07,855 --> 00:55:09,524
你疯了
You are mad.

461
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:14,216
经由陆路到亚喀巴 我们得越过尼法德沙漠
To come to Aqaba by land we should have to cross the Nef ud Desert.

462
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:15,885
没错
That's right.

463
00:55:16,197 --> 00:55:18,596
没人能越过尼法德沙漠
The Nef ud cannot be crossed.

464
00:55:18,596 --> 00:55:20,368
如果你愿意的话，我可以穿越过它
I'll cross it if you will.

465
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:24,644
你？只靠罗盘是办不到的，英国人
You? It takes more than a compass, Englishman.

466
00:55:25,061 --> 00:55:27,772
尼法德沙漠是真主创造出来 最可怕的地方
The Nef ud is the worst place God created.

467
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:32,047
我无法为地点做主 我只能为自己作主
I can't answer for the place. Only for myself.

468
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:33,924
五十个士兵？
Fifty men?

469
00:55:34,341 --> 00:55:36,740
只靠五十个士兵拿下亚喀巴？
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

470
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:39,451
如果这五十个人 能穿越尼法德沙漠
If 50 men came out of the Nef ud...

471
00:55:39,764 --> 00:55:42,788
会有其他人 加入这五十个人的行列
they would be 50 men other men might join.

472
00:55:43,517 --> 00:55:45,812
听说霍威塔特人在那里
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

473
00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:49,148
霍威塔特人是土匪 他们愿意把自己出卖给任何人
The Howeitat are brigands. They'll sell themselves to anyone.

474
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:51,651
-但他们是好战士 -没错
- Good fighters, though. - Good--

475
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,031
对，亚喀巴有枪炮
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

476
00:55:56,343 --> 00:56:00,306
枪炮都面对大海，阿里长官 而且都无法转向
They face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot be turned around.

477
00:56:00,723 --> 00:56:04,373
就内陆这个方面来说 在亚喀巴没有枪
From the landward side, there are no guns at Aqaba.

478
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:09,691
是有理由的 我们无法从内陆接近亚喀巴
With good reason. It cannot be approached from the landward side.

479
00:56:10,003 --> 00:56:12,506
土耳其人绝对想像不到的
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

480
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:17,928
亚喀巴在那里
Aqaba's over there.

481
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:22,725
现在只要决定去
It's only a matter of going.

482
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:26,166
你疯了
You are mad.

483
00:56:33,361 --> 00:56:35,864
你要去哪里？中尉
And where are you going, lieutenant?

484
00:56:37,324 --> 00:56:39,305
还带着我的五十个兄弟
With 50 of my men.

485
00:56:40,973 --> 00:56:42,120
去实现你的奇迹
To work your miracle.

486
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:46,604
咒骂神明不是旅程的好开始
Blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a journey.

487
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:50,045
-谁跟你说的？ -阿里
- Who told you? - Ali did.

488
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:51,922
为什么不是你呢？
Why not you?

489
00:56:53,695 --> 00:56:56,510
你要从延布撤退吗？
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

490
00:56:56,823 --> 00:56:59,013
对，我必须撤退
Yes, I must.

491
00:56:59,326 --> 00:57:02,350
但我会让你不必如此
But I will spare these to you.

492
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:07,355
阿里是否违反誓言告诉我？
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

493
00:57:08,085 --> 00:57:11,943
阿里长官对你效忠，殿下
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my lord.

494
00:57:12,986 --> 00:57:15,384
但你没告诉布莱顿上校
Yet you did not tell Colonel Brighton.

495
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:16,635
对
No.

496
00:57:28,627 --> 00:57:30,608
既然你知道…
Since you do know...

497
00:57:31,025 --> 00:57:34,571
我们可以以麦加费萨尔之名展开远征
we can claim to arrive in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

498
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:38,220
对，劳伦斯中尉，你可以那么说
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim it.

499
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:42,183
但你要以谁之名展开远征呢？
But in whose name do you ride?

500
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,486
长官，我抓到他们 他们一直在跟踪我们
Sherif, I caught them. They have tracked us.

501
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:16,197
他们来到这里，我抓到他们
They were here. I caught them.

502
01:00:16,197 --> 01:00:19,326
你们为什么要来这里？小子
Why are you here? Boy!

503
01:00:19,326 --> 01:00:21,203
为了服侍劳伦斯大人，沙利夫
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

504
01:00:21,515 --> 01:00:24,018
真的，劳伦斯 他们真的希望那么做
This is true, Lawrence. They do wish it.

505
01:00:24,331 --> 01:00:26,208
你们一直在跟踪我们
You have been tracking us.

506
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:29,336
-你奉命要留下来 -不，沙利夫
- You were told to stay. - No, sherif.

507
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:31,630
我们的骆驼迷路了 我们跟着他走
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

508
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:34,550
他带我们来这里 当劳伦斯大人的随从
She led us here to be Lord Lawrence's servants.

509
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:37,365
-这是阿拉的旨意 -你们轻视神明
- It is the will of Allah. - Blasphemy.

510
01:00:37,678 --> 01:00:38,929
别那么做！
Don't do that.

511
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:44,039
不，劳伦斯，这些人不是随从 他们是无父无母，被放逐的人
No, Lawrence, these are not servants. These are outcasts, parent-less.

512
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:47,376
我得警告你，他们并不适合
Be warned. They are not suitable.

513
01:00:47,688 --> 01:00:51,338
他们听起来挺适合的 你们负责载运行李
They sound very suitable. You can ride with the baggage.

514
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:56,448
他们不是随从，他们是朝圣者
These are not servants. These are worshippers.

515
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:03,330
每星期一先令？
One shilling, every week?

516
01:01:03,643 --> 01:01:05,207
那很公平
That is fair.

517
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:07,188
-每个人吗？ -不
- Each? - No.

518
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:08,961
-那太多了 -好吧
- That is too much. - All right.

519
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,682
能被你雇用是他们运气好 阿拉喜欢仁慈的人
They will be lucky for you. Allah favours the compassionate.

520
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:37,532
铁路在那边
There is the railway.

521
01:01:38,366 --> 01:01:41,286
那边是沙漠
And that is the desert.

522
01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:46,708
从这里到另一边，没有水源 只有我们带来的水
From here until the other side, no water but what we carry.

523
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:49,941
骆驼根本没水喝
For the camels, no water at all.

524
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:52,652
如果骆驼死了…
If the camels die...

525
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:55,363
我们就死定了
we die.

526
01:01:56,406 --> 01:01:59,117
在二十天后，他们会开始死亡
And in 20 days they will start to die.

527
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:07,876
那么我们别浪费时间了，对吧？
There's no time to waste, then, is there?

528
01:04:40,118 --> 01:04:41,682
我在思考
I was thinking.

529
01:04:41,995 --> 01:04:43,663
你在打瞌睡
You were drifting.

530
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:49,294
对，以后不会再发生这种事了
Yes. It will not happen again.

531
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:53,153
小心，你在打瞌睡
Be warned, you were drifting.

532
01:04:53,987 --> 01:04:55,968
以后不会再发生这种事了
It will not happen again.

533
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,993
那些水浪费了
That water is wasted.

534
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,709
从现在开始我们要在晚上出发
From now on, we must travel by night...

535
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:10,838
热到不能行走时就休息
and rest while it is too hot to travel.

536
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,549
每天只能走几小时
A few hours each day.

537
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:17,303
我们为什么不现在出发呢？
Why don't we start now?

538
01:06:17,616 --> 01:06:20,222
不，我们现在休息
No. We will rest now.

539
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:23,142
三小时
Three hours.

540
01:06:23,455 --> 01:06:24,810
好吧
Fine.

541
01:06:25,436 --> 01:06:26,896
我会叫你的
I'll wake you.

542
01:08:45,478 --> 01:08:46,938
我们要在这里休息？
Do we rest here?

543
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:50,379
没有水，现在别休息
There is no rest now short of water.

544
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:52,673
那儿的另一边
The other side of that.

545
01:08:53,924 --> 01:08:56,010
那边有多少那儿呢？
And how much of that is there?

546
01:08:56,427 --> 01:08:57,887
我不确定
I'm not sure.

547
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:03,100
但不管有多少，我们得在 明天太阳升起前越过它
But however much, it must be crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.

548
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:06,646
这是个太阳的铁砧
This is the sun's anvil.

549
01:10:39,346 --> 01:10:40,493
完成了吗？
Have we done it?

550
01:10:40,806 --> 01:10:43,935
还没，但我们逃过一劫
No, but we're off the anvil.

551
01:10:44,769 --> 01:10:46,541
谢天谢地
Thank God for that anyway.

552
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,418
对，谢天谢地
Yes, thank Him.

553
01:10:48,836 --> 01:10:52,277
劳伦斯，我想你不知道 你是怎么唆使他的
Lawrence, I do not think you know how you have tempted Him.

554
01:10:52,589 --> 01:10:53,841
我知道
I know.

555
01:10:57,178 --> 01:10:58,950
我们完成了
We've done it.

556
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:00,514
上天保佑
God willing.

557
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:04,685
我们何时能到达水井？
When do we reach the wells?

558
01:11:05,102 --> 01:11:08,231
上天保佑，中午
God willing, midday.

559
01:11:08,752 --> 01:11:12,089
-那么我们成功了 -感谢上天吧，劳伦斯
- Then we've done it. - Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

560
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:17,407
是嘉西姆的
Gasim's.

561
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:23,038
他怎么了？
What's happened to him?

562
01:11:23,872 --> 01:11:25,332
天知道
God knows.

563
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,773
你为什么不停下来？
Why don't you stop?

564
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:32,840
为什么？他中午就会死的
For what? He will be dead by midday.

565
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:39,930
我们得回去
We must go back.

566
01:11:40,243 --> 01:11:43,059
为什么？为了跟嘉西姆一起死吗？
What for, to die with Gasim?

567
01:11:44,414 --> 01:11:46,604
一小时内太阳会升起
In one hour comes the sun.

568
01:11:48,168 --> 01:11:52,756
以上天为名，听清楚！ 我们不能回头！
In God's name, understand! We cannot go back!

569
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:54,320
我可以
I can.

570
01:11:55,155 --> 01:11:56,823
把那些男孩带着
Take the boys.

571
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:05,374
如果你回头，你会害自己没命的
If you go back, you kill yourself, is all.

572
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:07,668
你已经杀了嘉西姆
Gasim you have killed already.

573
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:09,545
滚开
Get out of my way.

574
01:12:09,857 --> 01:12:13,716
嘉西姆的时间到了，劳伦斯 那是注定的
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence. It is written.

575
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:15,280
没有什么事是注定的！
Nothing is written!

576
01:12:18,512 --> 01:12:19,764
那么掉头吧！
Go back, then!

577
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:23,517
你为什么凭着你咒神又自大地 带着我们来到此地？
What did you bring us here for with your blasphemous conceit?

578
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,437
咒神的英国人！
English blasphemer!

579
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:29,044
亚喀巴？
Aqaba?

580
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,442
那是亚喀巴吗？
Was it Aqaba?

581
01:12:32,277 --> 01:12:34,988
你到不了亚喀巴的，英国人！
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

582
01:12:37,073 --> 01:12:38,637
掉头吧，咒神狂
Go back, blasphemer...

583
01:12:39,263 --> 01:12:41,244
但你到不了亚喀巴的！
but you will not be at Aqaba.

584
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,330
我会去亚喀巴的
I shall be at Aqaba.

585
01:12:43,643 --> 01:12:45,624
那是注定的…
That is written.

586
01:12:46,249 --> 01:12:47,501
在这里
In here.

587
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,180
英国人！
English!

588
01:12:59,492 --> 01:13:01,057
英国人！
English!

589
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:37,094
劳伦斯！杜德！
Lawrence! Daud!

590
01:21:45,561 --> 01:21:47,647
没有什么事是注定的
Nothing is written.

591
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:21,432
艾尔劳伦斯
Al Lawrence.

592
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:27,167
法拉吉
Farraj.

593
01:22:28,418 --> 01:22:29,461
洗一洗
Wash.

594
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:08,356
艾尔劳伦斯
Al Lawrence.

595
01:23:08,982 --> 01:23:13,465
真的，那些不相信命运的人 总是要眼见为凭
Truly, for some men nothing is written unless they write it.

596
01:23:18,262 --> 01:23:21,182
不是艾尔劳伦斯 只是劳伦斯
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

597
01:23:21,495 --> 01:23:24,206
-艾尔劳伦斯比较好 -没错
- AI Lawrence is better. - True.

598
01:23:26,187 --> 01:23:28,794
你爸爸也一样吗？ 只是劳伦斯先生
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

599
01:23:35,155 --> 01:23:38,074
我父亲是汤□斯查普曼爵士
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

600
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,785
-他是个贵族吗？ -算是吧
- Is that a lord? - A kind of lord.

601
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:43,914
当他死了之后，你会继承他的地位
Then when he dies, you too will be a lord.

602
01:23:44,331 --> 01:23:45,374
不
No.

603
01:23:47,668 --> 01:23:49,440
你有哥哥
You have an elder brother.

604
01:23:51,004 --> 01:23:56,114
但我不明白，你父亲姓查普曼
But then, I do not understand this. Your father's name is Chapman.

605
01:23:57,678 --> 01:23:59,555
他没娶我母亲
He didn't marry my mother.

606
01:24:01,223 --> 01:24:02,788
我懂了
I see.

607
01:24:03,309 --> 01:24:04,560
抱歉
I'm sorry.

608
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,504
那么我想你可以 自由地选择你的姓氏
It seems to me that you are free to choose your own name, then.

609
01:24:13,111 --> 01:24:15,613
对，我想是的
Yes, I suppose I am.

610
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:18,637
艾尔劳伦斯是最棒的
Al Lawrence is best.

611
01:24:21,661 --> 01:24:25,728
好吧，那就叫艾尔劳伦斯吧
All right, I'll settle for Al Lawrence.

612
01:24:55,447 --> 01:24:58,366
这是班尼威哈长官的袍子
They are the robes of a sherif of the Beni Wejh.

613
01:25:11,192 --> 01:25:12,756
非常好
Very fine.

614
01:25:14,946 --> 01:25:18,909
-我很荣幸 -我们也很荣幸，您好，长官
- Great honour. - The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

615
01:25:19,221 --> 01:25:21,515
-可以这样吗？ -当然
- Is it permitted? - Surely.

616
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:31,839
没有注定姓氏的人可以 自由地注定你的家族
He for whom nothing is written may write himself a clan.

617
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:43,100
穿了袍子骑骆驼很方便，试试看
They are good for riding. Try.

618
01:27:35,301 --> 01:27:36,865
你在做什么？英国人
What are you doing, Englishman?

619
01:27:38,325 --> 01:27:39,784
你都看到了
As you see.

620
01:27:41,244 --> 01:27:42,183
你一个人吗？
Are you alone?

621
01:27:42,704 --> 01:27:44,164
差不多吧
Almost.

622
01:27:52,923 --> 01:27:55,321
你跟那些从我井里 取水喝的狗在一起吗？
Are you with those dogs drinking at my well?

623
01:27:55,634 --> 01:27:56,990
那是你的井？
Yours?

624
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,412
我是奥达阿布塔耶
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

625
01:28:04,185 --> 01:28:06,896
我听说过另一个跟你同名的人
I've heard of another man of that name.

626
01:28:07,939 --> 01:28:09,503
另一个人？什么另一个人？
Other? What other?

627
01:28:10,024 --> 01:28:13,987
我听说过的那个奥达 不需要别人帮忙保护他的水井
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to summon help to look after his wells.

628
01:28:17,845 --> 01:28:19,826
他一定是个大英雄
He must be a great hero.

629
01:28:20,139 --> 01:28:21,703
是的
He is.

630
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,248
他不会拒绝提供水 给从尼法德沙漠走出来的人
He wouldn't ref use water to men coming out of Nef ud Desert.

631
01:28:25,561 --> 01:28:27,647
是吗？
Now, would he not?

632
01:28:30,358 --> 01:28:32,965
对，所以他一定是另一个人
No, that must be some other man.

633
01:28:35,572 --> 01:28:37,449
我的助手来了
Here is my help.

634
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:05,812
孩子，这是什么服装？
Son, what fashion is this?

635
01:29:07,167 --> 01:29:10,817
-这是哈利斯的服装 -哈利斯的什么部族？
- Harith, Father. - What manner of Harith?

636
01:29:11,442 --> 01:29:12,694
这是班尼威哈长官的袍子
A Beni Wejh sherif.

637
01:29:13,736 --> 01:29:15,196
他是哈利斯人吗？
And is he Harith?

638
01:29:15,509 --> 01:29:17,595
不，他是英国人
No, Father, English.

639
01:29:20,931 --> 01:29:22,183
孩子
Son...

640
01:29:23,121 --> 01:29:25,102
他们在偷我们的水
they are stealing our water.

641
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:27,918
告诉他们我们来了
Tell them we are coming.

642
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:29,691
告诉他们
Tell them.

643
01:30:39,764 --> 01:30:41,432
-倒光它！ -不要！
- Empty that! - Do not!

644
01:30:43,726 --> 01:30:45,812
我是哈威塔特的奥达
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

645
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,627
我是哈利斯的阿里
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

646
01:31:04,894 --> 01:31:06,145
哈利斯
Harith.

647
01:31:07,084 --> 01:31:08,231
阿里
Ali.

648
01:31:09,065 --> 01:31:11,150
你父亲还在偷东西吗？
Does your father still steal?

649
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,383
没有了
No.

650
01:31:16,156 --> 01:31:18,971
奥达把我误认为 他自己的私生子吗？
Does Auda take me for one of his own bastards?

651
01:31:20,327 --> 01:31:23,455
不，根本一点都不像
No. There is no resemblance.

652
01:31:24,289 --> 01:31:26,583
该死，你长得真像你父亲
Alas, you resemble your father.

653
01:31:27,209 --> 01:31:30,024
-奥达是在奉承我 -你很容易就被奉承了
- Auda flatters me. - You are easily flattered.

654
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:33,048
我跟你父亲很熟
I knew your father well.

655
01:31:33,465 --> 01:31:35,342
你认识你父亲吗？
Did you know your own?

656
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:43,371
我们有五十个人，你们只有两个 我们开枪射杀你们如何？
We are 50, you are two. How if we shot you down?

657
01:31:43,997 --> 01:31:47,021
那么哈威塔特人会跟你们结下梁子
Why, then you have a blood feud with the Howeitat.

658
01:31:48,272 --> 01:31:51,296
-你希望那样吗？ -在开罗的将军…
- Do you desire it? - Not the generals in Cairo...

659
01:31:51,922 --> 01:31:54,946
跟土耳其国王都不希望这样
nor the sultan himself desire that.

660
01:31:58,074 --> 01:31:59,221
叫你的人退下
Call off your men.

661
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,459
这光荣是属于无价值的
This honours the unworthy.

662
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:10,066
我才刚开始教他
I've only just begun to teach him.

663
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:14,133
你今天教了他什么？ 哈威塔特人的待客之道？
And what are you teaching him today? Howeitat hospitality?

664
01:32:14,758 --> 01:32:16,635
别耍嘴皮子，英国人
Be not clever with me, English.

665
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:21,641
-他是谁？ -他是费萨尔王子的朋友
- Who is he? - A friend of Prince Feisal's.

666
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:34,466
-你希望我@勤款待你？ -对
- So you desire my hospitality? - Yes.

667
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,031
他是你舌头吗？
Is he your tongue?

668
01:32:36,865 --> 01:32:38,429
我们真的很希望
We do desire it.

669
01:32:41,766 --> 01:32:44,685
如果你要的话，我会答应你的
Then it is given, if you will take it.

670
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,126
我在我的夏日别墅 那是个简陋的地方
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

671
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:53,132
对我来说那是个简陋的地方 有些人觉得那里很棒
Well, to me it seems a poor place. Some men find it marvellous.

672
01:32:53,966 --> 01:32:58,137
明天或许我会准土耳其人买下你 费萨尔的朋友
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

673
01:32:59,597 --> 01:33:00,848
但是…
But...

674
01:33:01,369 --> 01:33:02,621
跟我共进晚餐吧
dine with me.

675
01:33:03,976 --> 01:33:05,436
跟奥达一起用餐，英国人
Dine with Auda, English.

676
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:08,773
跟哈威塔特人一起用餐 哈利斯人
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

677
01:33:09,607 --> 01:33:14,300
我很荣幸能跟你 一起在万迪拉姆用餐！
It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rumm!

678
01:35:54,049 --> 01:35:57,595
你要进攻亚喀巴的事…
This thing you work against Aqaba...

679
01:35:58,116 --> 01:36:00,410
你希望得到什么好处呢？
what profit do you hope from it?

680
01:36:00,723 --> 01:36:03,226
我们是为了麦加的费萨尔才这么做的
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

681
01:36:03,538 --> 01:36:05,520
哈利斯人做事不是为了求好处
The Harith do not work for profit.

682
01:36:06,771 --> 01:36:10,525
如果有人一定要当仆人的话 阿里长官…
Well, if it is in a man to be a servant, Sherif Ali...

683
01:36:11,046 --> 01:36:13,549
也算是个好主人
he could find worse masters than Feisal.

684
01:36:13,966 --> 01:36:16,677
但我不能那么做
But I... I cannot serve.

685
01:36:17,616 --> 01:36:20,639
你允许土耳其人待在亚喀巴
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

686
01:36:20,952 --> 01:36:22,829
对，那是我的荣幸
Yes, it is my pleasure.

687
01:36:27,939 --> 01:36:31,276
我们这么做不是为了费萨尔
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

688
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:32,840
是吗？
No?

689
01:36:33,882 --> 01:36:36,489
-那么是为了英国人？ -是为了阿拉伯人
- For the English, then? - For the Arabs.

690
01:36:37,219 --> 01:36:38,575
阿拉伯人？
The Arabs?

691
01:36:39,513 --> 01:36:43,476
哈威塔特，阿吉亚尔，鲁阿拉 班尼夏卡尔，我知道这些部族
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala, Beni Sahkr, these I know.

692
01:36:43,997 --> 01:36:45,874
我听说过哈利斯人
I have even heard of the Harith.

693
01:36:46,604 --> 01:36:48,064
但是阿拉伯人？
But the Arabs?

694
01:36:48,585 --> 01:36:50,671
那是什么部族？
What tribe is that?

695
01:36:52,443 --> 01:36:56,406
他们是奴隶 他们服侍土耳其人
They're a tribe of slaves. They serve the Turks.

696
01:36:56,823 --> 01:36:58,700
他们对我来说什么都不是
Well, they are nothing to me.

697
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:01,098
我是哈威塔特人
My tribe is the Howeitat.

698
01:37:01,098 --> 01:37:03,392
做事只求好处
Who work only for profit.

699
01:37:03,705 --> 01:37:05,582
我们做事只为了取悦奥达
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

700
01:37:05,582 --> 01:37:08,085
而奥达的乐趣在于服侍土耳其人
And Auda's pleasure is to serve the Turks.

701
01:37:08,398 --> 01:37:09,545
服侍？
Serve?

702
01:37:10,066 --> 01:37:11,004
我会服侍人？
I serve?

703
01:37:11,317 --> 01:37:13,924
拿钱的人是仆人
It is the servant who takes money.

704
01:37:19,346 --> 01:37:20,911
我是奥达阿布塔耶
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

705
01:37:21,328 --> 01:37:22,996
-奥达会服侍人吗？ -不
- Does Auda serve? - No!

706
01:37:23,309 --> 01:37:26,437
-奥达会服侍人吗？ -不
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve? - No!

707
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:35,092
我身上的二十三处伤痕 都是在战争中受的伤
I carry 23 great wounds, all got in battle.

708
01:37:35,718 --> 01:37:39,159
我在战争中亲手杀了七十五个人
75 men have I killed with my own hands, in battle.

709
01:37:39,472 --> 01:37:43,434
我屠杀燃烧敌人的帐篷 我夺走他们的族人跟牲畜
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents. I take away their flocks and herds.

710
01:37:43,851 --> 01:37:47,814
土耳其人付我金子 但我还是很穷！
The Turks pay me a golden treasure, yet I am poor!

711
01:37:48,126 --> 01:37:52,089
因为我是人民的河流
Because I am a river to my people.

712
01:38:01,057 --> 01:38:02,099
那是服侍吗？
Is that service?

713
01:38:02,725 --> 01:38:03,872
不是
No.

714
01:38:10,754 --> 01:38:14,091
看来奥达老了
And yet now it seems Auda has grown old.

715
01:38:14,404 --> 01:38:17,324
失去了他的战斗力
And lost his taste for fighting.

716
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:21,286
你敢在我的帐篷里这么说 真是大胆
It is well you say it in my tent, thou old tulip.

717
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:25,457
这个胆大的人 是土耳其人收买不了的
Yet this is a tulip that the Turks could not buy.

718
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:27,438
他们为什么要收买他？
Why should they wish to?

719
01:38:29,732 --> 01:38:30,775
好了
Now...

720
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:35,363
我告诉你他们给我什么 你告诉我这是否是…
I will tell you what they pay me, and you will tell me if this is...

721
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:38,179
仆人的薪水
a servant's wages.

722
01:38:38,179 --> 01:38:42,141
他们每个月付我…
They pay me, month by month...

723
01:38:42,454 --> 01:38:46,416
一百个金币
100 golden guineas.

724
01:38:47,772 --> 01:38:50,796
是一百五十个，奥达
150, Auda.

725
01:38:51,109 --> 01:38:54,237
-是谁告诉你的？ -我的耳朵挺尖的
- Who told you that? - I have long ears.

726
01:38:54,237 --> 01:38:56,740
你的舌头也很长
And a long tongue between them.

727
01:38:56,740 --> 01:39:00,285
一百跟一百五十有什么差别？ 那只不过是一点钱
100, 150, what matters? It's a trifle.

728
01:39:00,285 --> 01:39:04,039
他们是从一个大箱子 拿出这么一点钱来的
A trifle which they take f rom a great box they have.

729
01:39:04,352 --> 01:39:06,229
在亚喀巴
In Aqaba.

730
01:39:07,584 --> 01:39:10,191
-在亚喀巴 -不然还有哪里？
- In Aqaba? - Where else?

731
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:13,945
你像女人一样令我烦心
You trouble me like women.

732
01:39:14,466 --> 01:39:17,490
朋友，我们太愚蠢了 奥达不会去的
Friends, we've been foolish. Auda won't come to Aqaba.

733
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,367
-为了钱？ -不
- For money? - No.

734
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,827
-为了费萨尔？ -不
- For Feisal? - No!

735
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:24,164
也不是为了赶走土耳其人
Nor to drive away the Turks.

736
01:39:24,998 --> 01:39:26,771
他会去…
He will come...

737
01:39:27,814 --> 01:39:30,003
因为那是他的荣幸
because it is his pleasure.

738
01:39:32,089 --> 01:39:35,739
你妈跟子上床
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

739
01:39:37,094 --> 01:39:40,535
愿老天爷领导你们！
Make God your agent!

740
01:39:41,891 --> 01:39:43,976
亚喀巴！
Aqaba!

741
01:39:44,289 --> 01:39:45,958
亚喀巴！
Aqaba!

742
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:03,580
愿真主与你同在
God be with you.

743
01:40:06,604 --> 01:40:08,272
愿真主与你同在
God be with you.

744
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,227
愿真主与你同在
God be with you.

745
01:40:24,748 --> 01:40:26,729
愿真主与你同在
God be with you.

746
01:43:22,433 --> 01:43:23,789
对
Yes.

747
01:43:24,101 --> 01:43:25,144
亚喀巴
Aqaba.

748
01:43:26,813 --> 01:43:29,419
明天我们会拿下它
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

749
01:43:30,775 --> 01:43:33,799
-你觉得我们会成功吗？ -会
- Do you think we shall? - Yes.

750
01:43:33,799 --> 01:43:36,510
如果枪炮的事你没说错
If you are right about the guns.

751
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,911
他杀人，他得死
He killed. He dies.

752
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:09,727
亚喀巴的事到此结束
This is the end of Aqaba.

753
01:44:12,438 --> 01:44:14,419
我们的人杀了奥达的手下
- One of our men murdered Auda's man. 

754
01:44:14,419 --> 01:44:15,462
为什么？
- Why?

755
01:44:15,775 --> 01:44:18,695
小偷？世仇？为什么并不重要
Theft? Blood feud? It makes no matter why.

756
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,363
阿里！
Ali!

757
01:44:20,884 --> 01:44:22,866
那是道旧伤口
It is an ancient wound.

758
01:44:22,866 --> 01:44:25,889
我不是来这里看部族血战的
I didn't come here to watch a tribal bloodbath.

759
01:44:30,373 --> 01:44:32,459
这是法律，劳伦斯
It is the law, Lawrence.

760
01:44:32,772 --> 01:44:34,961
法律说这个人得死
The law says the man must die.

761
01:44:36,004 --> 01:44:38,924
如果他死了 哈威塔特人就满意了？
If he dies, will that content the Howeitat?

762
01:44:40,071 --> 01:44:41,322
对
Yes.

763
01:44:44,763 --> 01:44:46,223
阿里长官！
Sherif Ali!

764
01:44:46,536 --> 01:44:49,456
如果奥达大人的手下 不伤害你们…
If none of Lord Auda's men harms any of yours...

765
01:44:49,977 --> 01:44:53,105
-那么哈利斯人会满足吗？ -对
- ...will that content the Harith? - Yes.

766
01:44:59,362 --> 01:45:01,864
那么我要执行法律
Then I will execute the law.

767
01:45:03,011 --> 01:45:04,993
我没有部族
I have no tribe.

768
01:45:06,348 --> 01:45:08,538
没人犯法
And no one is offended.

769
01:45:21,051 --> 01:45:21,990
嘉西姆
Gasim.

770
01:45:26,578 --> 01:45:27,933
那是你做的吗？
Did you do it?

771
01:45:54,941 --> 01:45:56,505
劳伦斯
Well, Lawrence...

772
01:46:04,117 --> 01:46:05,472
英国人在烦恼什么？
What ails the Englishman?

773
01:46:05,785 --> 01:46:09,331
他杀的那个人是 他从尼法德沙漠救回来的
That that he killed was the man he brought out of the Nef ud.

774
01:46:09,331 --> 01:46:11,312
那么那是注定好的
It was written, then.

775
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,127
早知不去救他
Better to have left him.

776
01:46:17,881 --> 01:46:21,218
这是在行刑，劳伦斯 没有什么可耻的
It was execution, Lawrence. No shame in that.

777
01:46:21,635 --> 01:46:23,825
而且这是必要的
Besides, it was necessary.

778
01:46:24,972 --> 01:46:27,057
你让他生，又让他死
You gave life and you took it.

779
01:46:27,787 --> 01:46:29,247
还是由你注定
The writing is still yours.

780
01:47:06,473 --> 01:47:08,455
奥达阿布塔耶！
Auda Abu Tayi!

781
01:50:24,596 --> 01:50:26,682
奇迹发生了
The miracle is accomplished.

782
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:29,393
征服者的光荣
Garlands for the conqueror.

783
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,728
给王子的贡品，给英雄的花
Tribute for the prince. Flowers for the man.

784
01:50:54,666 --> 01:50:56,231
我什么都不是，阿里
I'm none of those things, Ali.

785
01:50:56,648 --> 01:50:59,150
-那么你是什么？ -我不知道
- What, then? - Don't know.

786
01:51:00,297 --> 01:51:01,549
谢谢
Thanks.

787
01:51:03,113 --> 01:51:05,198
天啊，我爱这个国家
My God, I love this country.

788
01:51:07,075 --> 01:51:07,909
什么！
What!

789
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,829
亚喀巴里没黄金！
No gold in Aqaba!

790
01:51:12,289 --> 01:51:14,687
奥达，我找到了！
Auda, I found it!

791
01:51:23,864 --> 01:51:25,428
那真的是太可惜了
That's a pity.

792
01:51:29,077 --> 01:51:31,580
阿里，把消息传到延布的海边去
Ali, get a message down the coast to Yenbo.

793
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:34,500
告诉费萨尔找船，什么船都行
Tell Feisal to find boats, any boats...

794
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,628
尽快把阿拉伯军队带到亚喀巴来
and bring the Arab army here to Aqaba, quickly.

795
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,088
你呢？
And you?

796
01:51:39,922 --> 01:51:42,320
我要去告诉…
I'm going to tell the generals...

797
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:44,614
在开罗的将军们
in Cairo.

798
01:51:44,927 --> 01:51:47,221
对，穿过西奈半岛
Yes, cross Sinai.

799
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:48,577
来吧！
Come on!

800
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:50,141
西奈半岛？
Sinai?

801
01:51:50,767 --> 01:51:51,914
对
Yes.

802
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:56,189
-跟这些人？ -他们跟我在一起没事的
- With these? - They'll be all right with me.

803
01:52:01,403 --> 01:52:05,469
听着，阿里 如果你的贝都因人跑到开罗说：
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and said:

804
01:52:05,887 --> 01:52:08,598
“我们拿下亚喀巴了” 将军们会一笑置之
"We've taken Aqaba, " the generals would laugh.

805
01:52:09,432 --> 01:52:10,787
我懂了
I see.

806
01:52:11,309 --> 01:52:14,437
在开罗，你得脱下那些可笑的衣服
In Cairo you will put off these funny clothes.

807
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:18,712
你要穿上裤子 跟人们诉说我们的古怪跟野蛮
You'll wear trousers and tell stories ofour quaintness and barbarity...

808
01:52:19,651 --> 01:52:21,736
然后他们会相信你
and then they will believe you.

809
01:52:22,466 --> 01:52:24,552
你是个愚昧的人
You're an ignorant man.

810
01:52:44,573 --> 01:52:45,928
纸张
Paper.

811
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:48,639
纸张！
Paper!

812
01:52:51,559 --> 01:52:54,166
亚喀巴没有黄金
There is no gold in Aqaba.

813
01:52:55,209 --> 01:52:57,086
没有黄金

814

没有大箱子！

815
01:53:04,698 --> 01:53:06,888
奥达来到亚喀巴是为了黄金吗？
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

816
01:53:07,513 --> 01:53:09,807
就像你说过的，我是为了荣幸
For my pleasure, as you said.

817
01:53:11,059 --> 01:53:13,561
但黄金是荣耀的东西
But gold is honorable...

818
01:53:14,604 --> 01:53:17,211
而劳伦斯答应会有黄金的
and Lawrence promised gold.

819
01:53:18,462 --> 01:53:19,505
劳伦斯说谎
Lawrence lied.

820
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:22,946
看好，奥达
See, Auda.

821
01:53:25,657 --> 01:53:27,743
“英国的皇室”
"The Crown of England...

822
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:31,288
“答应要付”

01:53:32,331 --> 01:53:36,502
“五千个金币”

824
01:53:37,127 --> 01:53:41,820
“给奥达阿布塔耶”

“以国王殿下之名”
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

826
01:53:47,555 --> 01:53:48,910
“我在此”

827
01:53:50,787 --> 01:53:51,830
“签名”

828
01:53:53,082 --> 01:53:55,063
十天内…
In 10 days...

829
01:53:56,001 --> 01:53:57,982
我会带着黄金回来
I'll be back with the gold.

830
01:53:59,129 --> 01:54:03,822
我会带枪，黄金跟所有的东西回来

831
01:54:04,969 --> 01:54:06,429
十天
Ten days.

832
01:54:07,889 --> 01:54:09,348
你要穿过西奈半岛？
You'll cross Sinai?

833
01:54:09,766 --> 01:54:11,017
为什么不行？
Why not?

834
01:54:11,851 --> 01:54:13,415
摩西曾那么做过
Moses did.

835
01:54:16,231 --> 01:54:18,316
你要带着孩子们同行？
And you will take the children?

836
01:54:19,672 --> 01:54:21,027
摩西曾那么做过
Moses did.

837
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:23,009
摩西是个圣徒
Moses was a prophet...

838
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:26,032
他受上帝的垂爱！
and beloved of God.

839
01:54:31,455 --> 01:54:35,417
他说过这里有黄金，他骗人
He said there was gold here. He lied.

840
01:54:36,877 --> 01:54:39,693
他不完美
He is not perfect.

841
01:54:49,807 --> 01:54:52,206
天啊，我们能不休息吗？
Lord, can we not rest?

842
01:54:52,414 --> 01:54:55,438
我说过除非他们知道 我拿下亚喀巴，不然不能休息
I told you, no rest till they know that I have Aqaba.

843
01:54:57,732 --> 01:54:59,505
你们两个试过在床上睡吗？
Have you two slept in beds?

844
01:54:59,818 --> 01:55:00,860
法拉吉？
Farraj?

845
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:02,842
杜德？
Daud?

846
01:55:04,093 --> 01:55:05,761
有床单的？
With sheets?

847
01:55:07,638 --> 01:55:11,079
明天我们会在开罗最好的饭店里 最好的房间盖着最好的床单
Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

848
01:55:11,392 --> 01:55:12,644
我保证
I promise.

849
01:55:12,956 --> 01:55:15,563
那么就这么说定了，大人
Then it shall be so, lord.

850
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:38,295
你看！
Look!

851
01:55:45,073 --> 01:55:46,533
是火柱
Pillar of fire.

852
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:51,747
不，大人，是灰尘
No, lord. Dust.

853
01:56:41,486 --> 01:56:42,842
我的罗盘
My compass.

854
01:56:44,823 --> 01:56:46,074
没关系
No matter.

855
01:56:46,596 --> 01:56:50,141
如果我们往西走 一定可以走到运河那边
If we ride west, we must strike the canal.

856
01:56:50,558 --> 01:56:51,914
往西前进
Due west.

857
01:57:13,123 --> 01:57:14,583
来吧！
Come on!

858
01:57:48,035 --> 01:57:50,662
劳伦斯！
Lawrence!

859
01:57:52,393 --> 01:57:55,000
劳伦斯！
Lawrence!

860
01:58:03,384 --> 01:58:04,677
法拉吉
Farraj!

861
01:58:14,938 --> 01:58:17,816
法拉吉，不要！…
Farraj, don't! Don't!

862
01:58:19,296 --> 01:58:22,112
不要！
Don't!

863
01:59:56,481 --> 01:59:57,732
你为什么要走？
Why do you walk?

864
02:00:00,443 --> 02:00:02,320
为什么？大人
But why, lord?

865
02:00:13,686 --> 02:00:14,938
为什么？大人
But why, lord?

866
02:00:15,146 --> 02:00:18,587
这可以乘坐两个人，走路没意思
There is room for both. It serves no purpose.

867
02:00:44,448 --> 02:00:46,846
劳伦斯，你看！
Lawrence, look!

868
02:01:23,655 --> 02:01:24,906
(警告)

869
02:01:55,772 --> 02:01:57,857
没关系的，法拉吉
It's all right, Farraj.

870
02:01:58,066 --> 02:01:59,526
没关系的
It's all right.

871
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,377
你是谁？
Who are you?

872
02:03:15,567 --> 02:03:18,174
你是谁？
Who are you?

-杜德！ -我们在这里，大人

878
02:04:45,795 --> 02:04:49,132
你想去哪里啊？穆斯塔法
And where the hell do you think you're going to, Mustapha?

879
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:51,530
我们渴了
We are thirsty.

880
02:04:53,407 --> 02:04:55,805
-劳伦斯先生，是吗？ -对
- Mr. Lawrence, is it? - Yes.

881
02:04:56,222 --> 02:04:59,246
-你要去军官酒吧？ -对
- Are you going to the officers' bar? - Yes.

882
02:05:00,706 --> 02:05:02,896
你不能带他进去，先生
You can't take him in there, sir.

883
02:05:06,546 --> 02:05:09,048
你觉得你像什么东西？
What do you think you look like?

884
02:05:27,818 --> 02:05:29,382
不，你得离开
No, no. You must go.

885
02:05:29,695 --> 02:05:31,155
不，来吧，朋友！
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

886
02:05:33,032 --> 02:05:35,743
滚出去！你得滚出去！滚出去！
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

887
02:05:37,411 --> 02:05:41,478
我们要两杯大杯的柠檬汁
We want two large glasses of lemonade.

888
02:05:41,999 --> 02:05:45,753
-这是英国军官的酒吧 -我们并不介意
- This is a bar for British officers. - We are not particular.

889
02:05:51,176 --> 02:05:54,929
-你疯了吗？ -不，很奇怪地我没疯
- Are you off your head? - No. Oddly enough I'm not.

890
02:05:55,347 --> 02:05:58,892
-请你快离开，好吗？ -让那孩子滚出去
- Just clear out of here, will you? - Get that boy out of here.

891
02:05:59,309 --> 02:06:01,812
下士，我们要把这家伙赶出去
Corporal, we'll have this one out anyway.

892
02:06:02,646 --> 02:06:05,148
-把那个混蛋赶出去 -滚开
- Get that wog out of here. - Clear off.

893
02:06:07,338 --> 02:06:09,007
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

894
02:06:11,926 --> 02:06:15,784
-是劳伦斯，长官 -我要加冰的柠檬汁
- It's Lawrence, sir. - Lemonade with ice.

895
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:18,808
你解释吧
Explain yourself.

896
02:06:19,434 --> 02:06:21,207
我们拿下亚喀巴了
We've taken Aqaba.

897
02:06:21,832 --> 02:06:24,335
-拿下亚喀巴？谁啊？ -我们
- Taken Aqaba? Who has? - We have.

898
02:06:24,752 --> 02:06:28,923
我们的战友拿下亚喀巴 那些混蛋成功了
Our side in this war has. The wogs have.

899
02:06:29,966 --> 02:06:31,217
我们成功了
We have.

900
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:34,971
他喜欢你的柠檬汁
He likes your lemonade.

901
02:06:35,388 --> 02:06:37,161
你是说土耳其人离开了？
You mean the Turks have gone?

902
02:06:37,578 --> 02:06:40,498
不，他们还在那儿 但是他们已经失势
No, they're still there but they've no boots.

903
02:06:41,019 --> 02:06:45,086
我们把他们全都关了起来 所有的部队都被关了起来
Prisoners, sir. We took them prisoners. The entire garrison.

904
02:06:45,607 --> 02:06:47,797
那不是真的，我们杀了一些人
That's not true. We killed some.

905
02:06:48,110 --> 02:06:51,864
事实上是很多人 我下次会处理的更好
Too many, really. I'll manage it better next time.

906
02:06:53,324 --> 02:06:56,139
不论如何都会死很多人
There's been a lot of killing one way or another.

907
02:06:58,329 --> 02:07:01,770
我发毒誓，那是真的
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's all perfectly true.

908
02:07:02,083 --> 02:07:04,794
-那是不可能的 -那是真的
- It isn't possible. - Yes, it is.

909
02:07:05,315 --> 02:07:06,984
我做到了
I did it.

910
02:07:12,302 --> 02:07:13,866
你最好去跟艾伦比谈谈
You'd better talk to Allenby.

911
02:07:14,179 --> 02:07:16,890
-艾伦比将军？ -现在他是指挥官，墨瑞走了
- General Allenby? - He's in command. Murray's gone.

912
02:07:17,203 --> 02:07:19,392
那么做是对的
That's a step in the right direction.

913
02:07:20,122 --> 02:07:22,833
首先我要一个房间，要有床跟床单
First I want a room. With a bed, with sheets.

914
02:07:23,251 --> 02:07:25,857
-对，当然 -那是给他的
- Yes, of course. - It's for him.

915
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:30,550
对，你要一张自己的床，对吧？
Right. You want a bed yourself, don't you?

916
02:07:30,863 --> 02:07:32,740
但先去见艾伦比吧
See Allenby first, though.

917
02:07:33,574 --> 02:07:35,034
他会见我吗？
Will he see me?

918
02:07:35,972 --> 02:07:37,328
我想会的
I think so.

919
02:07:38,162 --> 02:07:39,622
那么就去做吧
Do that, then.

920
02:07:44,627 --> 02:07:47,130
-我最好去刮个胡子 -对，没错
- I'd better shave. - Yes, you had.

921
02:07:47,442 --> 02:07:50,049
你最好去换条裤子
You'd better get into some trousers too.

922
02:08:01,311 --> 02:08:03,084

毫无疑问地你是个有趣的人
You're an interesting man, there's no doubt about it.

931

933
02:08:39,267 --> 02:08:40,727
那么你为什么要那么做？
Then why did you?

934
02:08:40,727 --> 02:08:43,230
-亚喀巴很重要 -为什么它很重要？
- Aqaba's important. - Why is it important?

935
02:08:43,543 --> 02:08:45,941
-那是土耳其人到运河的路线 -不再是了
- It's the Turkish route to the canal. - Not anymore.

936
02:08:46,254 --> 02:08:50,320
-他们现在从比尔沙巴走 -我知道，但我们进入了加萨
- They're coming through Beersheba. - I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

937
02:08:50,633 --> 02:08:55,221
-所以呢？ -拿下亚喀巴对你来说很重要
- So? - So that left Aqaba behind your right.

938
02:08:55,847 --> 02:08:56,786
真的
True.

939
02:08:57,098 --> 02:09:01,582
当你到耶路撒冷时 亚喀巴对你来说就更重要了
And it will be further behind your right when you go for Jerusalem.

940
02:09:02,625 --> 02:09:04,919
我要到耶路撒冷去？
Am I going for Jerusalem?

941

亚喀巴对我来说很重要

944
02:09:12,948 --> 02:09:15,764
它能威胁艾尔阿瑞许跟加萨

945
02:09:17,432 --> 02:09:18,475

不，我想你们 应该把他们留在那里
No. I think you should leave them there.

950
02:09:30,362 --> 02:09:32,239
你在没接到 命令的情况下擅自行动
You acted without orders, you know.

951
02:09:33,073 --> 02:09:37,036
军官不是随时 都该主动进取吗？
Shouldn't officers use their initiative at all times?

952
02:09:37,453 --> 02:09:39,747
事实上不然，那太危险了
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

953
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:42,250
对，我知道
Yes, I know.

954
02:09:42,667 --> 02:09:44,231
你已经知道了？
Already?

955
02:09:44,439 --> 02:09:45,586
对
Yes.

956
02:09:47,463 --> 02:09:49,966
我要把你升上少校
I'm promoting you major.

957
02:09:51,113 --> 02:09:53,303
我不觉得那是个好主意
I don't think that's a very good idea.

958
02:09:53,616 --> 02:09:56,535
我没问你意见，我要你回去…
I didn't ask you. I want you to go back...

959
02:09:56,848 --> 02:10:00,498
继续执行你的成果
and carry on the good work.

960
02:10:01,123 --> 02:10:03,835
不，谢谢您，长官
No. Thank you, sir.

961
02:10:04,356 --> 02:10:08,527
-为什么不？ -我，那个…
- Why not? - Well, l, it's...

962
02:10:08,527 --> 02:10:09,778
我想想看…
Let me see now...

963
02:10:11,551 --> 02:10:15,305
我杀了两个人，我是说阿拉伯人
I killed two people. I mean, two Arabs.

964
02:10:15,618 --> 02:10:17,703
其中一个是个孩子
One was a boy.

965
02:10:18,016 --> 02:10:19,372
那是…
That was...

966
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,917
昨天的事
yesterday.

967
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:25,107
我把他领进流沙里
I led him into a quicksand.

968
02:10:25,524 --> 02:10:26,984
另一个是个男人
The other was a man.

969
02:10:27,505 --> 02:10:29,278
那是在…
That was...

970
02:10:29,591 --> 02:10:31,989
我们拿下亚喀巴之前的事
before Aqaba, anyway.

971
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:35,326
我得用我的枪来处决他
I had to execute him with my pistol.

972
02:10:35,847 --> 02:10:38,871
我不喜欢这样的事
There was something about it I didn't like.

973
02:10:39,184 --> 02:10:42,208
-当然 -不，还有别的事
- Well, naturally. - No. Something else.

974
02:10:44,606 --> 02:10:46,900
没关系，把它当成是个警告吧
That's all right. Let it be a warning.

975
02:10:47,213 --> 02:10:49,194
不，还有别的事
No. Something else.

976
02:10:50,863 --> 02:10:52,427
什么事？
What, then?

977
02:10:53,365 --> 02:10:55,659
我喜欢那样
I enjoyed it.

978
02:11:03,271 --> 02:11:06,713
胡说八道，你疯了，你太累了
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves. You're tired.

979
02:11:08,589 --> 02:11:12,135
你打扮成那样是什么意思？ 你现在是业余演员？
What do you mean coming dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?

980
02:11:12,343 --> 02:11:14,012
对，没错
Yes. Entirely.

981
02:11:14,325 --> 02:11:17,349
让我看看那个像帽子的东西
Let me see that hat thing or whatever it is.

982
02:11:17,766 --> 02:11:19,643
他们的装备很棒
Fascinating gear they wear.

983
02:11:19,955 --> 02:11:22,145
我穿起来怎么样？哈利
How would I look in this, Harry?

984
02:11:22,458 --> 02:11:25,899
-很可笑，长官 -拿去，你留着吧
- Damn ridiculous, sir. - Here, you keep it.

985
02:11:26,942 --> 02:11:30,904
我想说的是我并不适合
What I'm trying to say is I don't think I'm fit for it.

986
02:11:31,321 --> 02:11:34,137
真的吗？你觉得呢？戴丹
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

987
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:39,664
在他那么做之前，长官 我会说那是不可能的
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it couldn't be done.

988
02:11:40,081 --> 02:11:43,000
-布莱顿？ -我知道他的想法
- Brighton? - I know what he thinks.

989
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:47,484
我想你该进行授勋典礼
I think you should recommend a decoration, sir.

990
02:11:47,901 --> 02:11:51,030
我觉得他的动机不重要
I don't think it matters what his motives were.

991
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:54,054
他指挥军队很出色
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

992
02:11:55,722 --> 02:11:57,495
-柏金斯先生！ -长官！
- Mr. Perkins! - Sir!

993
02:11:57,807 --> 02:12:00,414
我们去喝一杯吧，男士们
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

994
02:12:04,481 --> 02:12:08,131
-你听说了吗？柏金斯先生 -我听说了
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins? - Yes, sir.

995
02:12:08,131 --> 02:12:12,615
-你觉得如何？ -真的是太棒，长官，做得好
- What do you think about it? - Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

996
02:12:12,615 --> 02:12:15,638
-谢谢你，柏金斯先生 -长官
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins. - Sir!

997
02:12:21,374 --> 02:12:22,938
那么来吧
Come on, then.

998
02:12:26,587 --> 02:12:28,256
你是个聪明人
You're a clever man, sir.

999
02:12:28,673 --> 02:12:32,218
不，我懂得把握机会
No, but I know a good thing when I see one.

1000
02:12:32,635 --> 02:12:35,242
那很公平，对吧？
That's fair, surely?

1001
02:12:55,784 --> 02:13:00,790
若我得在耶路撒冷那边有突破 我得集中力量，不是消散力量
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem, I must concentrate, not dissipate.

1002
02:13:01,103 --> 02:13:03,292
-太棒了 -你懂吗？
- Bravo. - You know better?

1003
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,024
我跟克劳西威兹般作战 然后你像萨克森一样作战
I fight like Clausewitz, then you fight like Saxe.

1004
02:13:26,024 --> 02:13:28,423
我们可以做得很好，对吧？
We should do very well indeed, shouldn't we?

1005
02:14:05,023 --> 02:14:07,422
男士们，轻松点
Easy, gentlemen, please.

1006
02:14:08,673 --> 02:14:10,758
-麻烦你端杯酒来 -没问题
- Give us a drink. - Of course, sir.

1007
02:14:11,384 --> 02:14:14,929
我是受劳伦斯少校之邀前来的
I'm here at the invitation of Major Lawrence.

1008
02:14:15,659 --> 02:14:16,806
崔西
Tracy.

1009
02:14:18,788 --> 02:14:20,560
我们要到外面去吗？
Shall we go outside?

1010
02:14:31,822 --> 02:14:35,055
你牵制住土耳其的沙漠军队了？
So you hold bound the Turkish desert army?

1011
02:14:35,263 --> 02:14:36,306
对
Yes.

1012
02:14:36,619 --> 02:14:40,060
用一千个阿拉伯人？
With 1000 Arabs?

1013
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:43,084
一千个阿拉伯人 代表一千把刀子
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1014
02:14:43,397 --> 02:14:45,274
不论日夜他们随时待命
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1015
02:14:45,899 --> 02:14:47,463
代表着一千只骆驼
It means 1000 camels.

1016
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:51,947
那代表一千包的炸药 跟一千把的来福枪
That means 1000 packs of high explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1017
02:14:52,677 --> 02:14:56,431
当土耳其人还在团团转时 我们可以越过阿拉伯
We can cross Arabia while Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1018
02:14:57,161 --> 02:14:58,934
我要粉碎他们的铁路
I'll smash his railways.

1019
02:14:59,246 --> 02:15:01,749
当他们忙着修护铁路时 我会在别地发动破坏行动
While he mends, I'll smash them somewhere else.

1020
02:15:02,062 --> 02:15:04,669
在十三个星期内 我可以让阿拉伯陷于混乱
In 13 weeks I can have Arabia in chaos.

1021
02:15:04,982 --> 02:15:07,276
那么你要回去罗？
You are going back, then?

1022
02:15:10,195 --> 02:15:11,447
对
Yes.

1023
02:15:11,864 --> 02:15:14,158
我当然要回去
Of course I'm going back.

1024
02:15:18,537 --> 02:15:20,936
如果我们想得到 那么土耳其人也想得到
Well, if we can see it, so can the Turk.

1025
02:15:21,248 --> 02:15:25,211
如果他们发现得用四个军队 来防守一小群的土匪…
If he finds he's using four divisions to fend off a handf ul of bandits...

1026
02:15:25,732 --> 02:15:26,775
他们会撤退的
he'll withdraw.

1027
02:15:27,088 --> 02:15:29,695
他们不敢撤退的 阿拉伯是他们帝国的一部份
He daren't withdraw. Arabia's part of his empire.

1028
02:15:30,112 --> 02:15:32,510
如果他们现在离开 他们永远都无法回来了
If he gets out now, he'll never get back again.

1029
02:15:32,823 --> 02:15:35,326
-不知道谁能拥有此地 -没有人可以
- I wonder who will. - No one will.

1030
02:15:36,056 --> 02:15:38,141
阿拉伯现在是阿拉伯人的
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1031
02:15:44,189 --> 02:15:46,379
反正我是那么告诉他们的
That's what I've told them anyway.

1032
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:48,673
他们是那么想的
That's what they think.

1033
02:15:49,299 --> 02:15:52,427
-那就是他们战斗的原因 -当然
- That's why they're fighting. - Oh, surely.

1034
02:15:55,555 --> 02:15:57,745
他们只有一个怀疑
They've only one suspicion.

1035
02:15:58,266 --> 02:16:02,437
我们让他们赶走土耳其人 然后自己占据了阿拉伯
That we'll let them drive the Turks out and then move in ourselves.

1036
02:16:02,854 --> 02:16:07,547
我告诉他们那是不对的 我们对阿拉伯没兴趣
I've told them that that's false, that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1037
02:16:07,547 --> 02:16:08,485
是吗？
Have we?

1038
02:16:09,111 --> 02:16:11,196
谢天谢地，我不是政客
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1039
02:16:11,509 --> 02:16:14,533
我们对阿拉伯有兴趣吗？戴丹
Have we any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?

1040
02:16:15,576 --> 02:16:17,870
这是个很难的问题
Difficult question, sir.

1041
02:16:19,851 --> 02:16:23,605
我想知道能否以你之名告诉他们
I want to know, sir, if I can tell them in your name...

1042
02:16:23,918 --> 02:16:27,255
我们对阿拉伯没兴趣
that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1043
02:16:28,298 --> 02:16:29,757
当然可以
Certainly.

1044
02:16:47,276 --> 02:16:50,717
两千件兵器还不够 我需要五千件
2000 small arms, not enough. I need five.

1045
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:52,177
好
Right.

1046
02:16:52,385 --> 02:16:55,722
还有钱，我要金币 他们不喜欢纸钞
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns. They don't like paper.

1047
02:16:56,869 --> 02:17:00,101
-刘易斯机枪的教官 -好
- Instructors for the Lewis guns. - Right.

1048
02:17:00,414 --> 02:17:01,978
更多的钱
More money.

1049
02:17:02,291 --> 02:17:05,420
-更多是多少？ -现在要两万五，日后要更多
- How much more? - 25, 000 now. A lot more later.

1050
02:17:05,732 --> 02:17:08,339
-戴丹？ -没问题，长官
- Dryden? - It can be done, sir.

1051
02:17:08,756 --> 02:17:11,467
几部武装车辆
A couple of armoured cars.

1052
02:17:11,676 --> 02:17:13,032
好
Right.

1053
02:17:13,866 --> 02:17:15,326
大炮
Field artillery.

1054
02:17:17,515 --> 02:17:18,871
好
Right.

1055
02:17:21,791 --> 02:17:23,981
我会尽力提供你需要的东西
I'll give you every blessed thing I can...

1056
02:17:24,293 --> 02:17:27,109
因为我知道你会用到它们，恭喜
because I know you'll use it. Congratulations.

1057
02:17:27,422 --> 02:17:30,133
谢谢你们的招待，绅士们
Thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.

1058
02:18:05,795 --> 02:18:07,672
恭喜！
Congratulations!

1059
02:18:17,995 --> 02:18:21,019
你真的要给他们大炮吗？长官
Are you really going to give them artillery, sir?

1060
02:18:21,332 --> 02:18:23,105
我很怀疑啊
I was wondering that, sir.

1061
02:18:23,417 --> 02:18:25,503
要把它们拿回来可能很难
Might be difficult to get it back.

1062
02:18:25,816 --> 02:18:29,570
给他们大炮，等于让他们独立
Give them artillery and you've made them independent.

1063
02:18:29,570 --> 02:18:31,447
那就不能给他们大炮，对吧？
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1064
02:18:31,759 --> 02:18:33,636
-那是你的决定 -不是
- For you to say. - No, it's not.

1065
02:18:33,949 --> 02:18:36,660
我得遵守命令，谢天谢地
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1066
02:18:36,973 --> 02:18:38,850
跟那个可怜的家伙不同
Not like that poor devil.

1067
02:18:39,476 --> 02:18:40,831
他像是在骑着旋风
He's riding the whirlwind.

1068
02:18:41,144 --> 02:18:43,334
希望我们不是
Let's hope we're not.

1069
02:18:50,529 --> 02:18:55,326
(休息时间)

1070
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,900
对不起，朋友 这些袋子是什么人的？
Excuse me, friend. Who do these bags belong to?

1071
02:24:10,954 --> 02:24:12,101
是费萨尔王子的
To Prince Feisal.

1072
02:24:12,518 --> 02:24:15,229
-你不是费萨尔王子吧？ -我不是
- You're not Prince Feisal? - No.

1073
02:24:15,438 --> 02:24:17,002
你认识他吗？
You know him though?

1074
02:24:17,002 --> 02:24:20,338
他是我的主人，我是他的仆人
He is my master. I am his servant.

1075
02:24:23,675 --> 02:24:24,927
你识字吗？
Can you read?

1076
02:24:28,472 --> 02:24:30,349
(J.E.班特利先生)

1077
02:24:33,581 --> 02:24:38,065
我是芝加哥快报的记者 但我文章在美国多家报社刊登
Chicago Courier is my paper, but my work is syndicated in America.

1078
02:24:38,378 --> 02:24:41,923
我从你的来信中知道了 班特利先生
I understood so from your letter, Mr. Bentley.

1079
02:24:56,209 --> 02:24:57,252
好了
Now...

1080
02:24:58,503 --> 02:25:02,361
-我在哪里能找到劳伦斯少校？ -那是你来此地的目的吗？
- Where can I find Major Lawrence? - Is that what you have come for?

1081
02:25:02,674 --> 02:25:04,760
我不是只为了这件事而来
Not altogether, sir, no.

1082
02:25:05,073 --> 02:25:09,556
班特利先生 劳伦斯少校在我的军队里
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find Major Lawrence with my army.

1083
02:25:09,556 --> 02:25:12,685
那就是我的意思，先生 我在哪里能找到你的军队？
That's what I meant, sir. Where can I find your army?

1084
02:25:12,997 --> 02:25:14,145
我不知道
I don't know.

1085
02:25:14,874 --> 02:25:17,377
-上星期他们在艾尔盖拉附近 -盖拉？
- Last week they were near El Ghira. - Ghira?

1086
02:25:17,794 --> 02:25:21,548
对，恐怕你得走上一段路 你会骑骆驼吗？
Yes, I fear you have a long journey. Can you ride a camel?

1087
02:25:22,591 --> 02:25:25,093
-我从来都没试过 -那你骑骡子吧
- I've never tried. - Take a mule.

1088
02:25:25,823 --> 02:25:27,805
避开米拉哈，那里有土耳其人
A void Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1089
02:25:28,326 --> 02:25:30,829
他们现在在米拉哈？ 他们的动作真快
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1090
02:25:31,141 --> 02:25:32,288
没错
They do.

1091
02:25:32,601 --> 02:25:35,730
但没我们快，你会看到的
But not so fast as we do, you will find.

1092
02:25:36,147 --> 02:25:37,502
我自己…
Myself...

1093
02:25:38,232 --> 02:25:40,005
要到开罗去
I am going to Cairo.

1094
02:25:40,318 --> 02:25:42,195
-你是知道的 -对
- As you know. - Yes.

1095
02:25:42,507 --> 02:25:45,010
那里有别的工作等着我去做
There's work for me there of a different kind.

1096
02:25:45,636 --> 02:25:46,678
对
Yes.

1097
02:25:50,432 --> 02:25:52,726
我知道你一直都没拿到大炮
I know you've been given no artillery.

1098
02:25:53,248 --> 02:25:55,750
-没错 -你陷入困境了？
- That is so. - You're handicapped?

1099
02:25:55,959 --> 02:25:58,149
这让我们被局限在小事上
It restricts us to small things.

1100
02:25:58,149 --> 02:25:59,504
正是他们的计划
It's intended to.

1101
02:26:02,215 --> 02:26:03,780
你认识艾伦比将军吗？
Do you know General Allenby?

1102
02:26:04,822 --> 02:26:08,159
小心艾伦比 他是个狡猾的家伙
Watch out for Allenby. He's a slim customer.

1103
02:26:08,576 --> 02:26:11,183
-对不起 -他是个聪明人
- Excuse me? - A clever man.

1104
02:26:11,496 --> 02:26:14,416
狡猾的家伙，说的好
Slim customer. It's very good.

1105
02:26:14,728 --> 02:26:19,212
我当然会小心他 你真的是太好心了
I'll certainly watch out for him. You're being very sympathetic.

1106
02:26:19,629 --> 02:26:22,966
殿下，美国人也曾是殖民
Your Highness, we Americans were once a colonial people.

1107
02:26:23,279 --> 02:26:25,573
我们当然会同情
We naturally feel sympathetic to any people...

1108
02:26:25,886 --> 02:26:28,284
那些为争取自由而努力的人
who struggle for their freedom.

1109
02:26:28,284 --> 02:26:30,474
真的是太好了
Very gratifying.

1110
02:26:33,289 --> 02:26:37,773
还有我的目的跟你一样 你希望世人知道你的故事
Also, my interests are the same as yours. You want your story told.

1111
02:26:37,773 --> 02:26:40,067
我很需要一个这样的故事
I badly want a story to tell.

1112
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:44,134
你在胡扯了，对吧？
Ah, now you are talking turkey, are you not?

1113
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:47,784
我会派响导给你 并帮你写一封信的
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1114
02:26:47,784 --> 02:26:49,661
在我离开这里之前…
And before I leave here...

1115
02:26:50,078 --> 02:26:52,268
我得立刻离开
which must be presently...

1116
02:26:52,580 --> 02:26:56,126
我会写下一些事实跟数字给你
I will have some facts and figures put on paper for you.

1117
02:26:58,003 --> 02:27:01,235
你知道我们在破坏土耳其人的铁路
You know that we are destroying the Turkish railways.

1118
02:27:01,548 --> 02:27:02,487
是的，殿下
I do, sir.

1119
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:05,719
劳伦斯少校负责这次的行动，对吧？
Major Lawrence is in charge of all this, is he?

1120
02:27:06,032 --> 02:27:08,430
我的军队是由沙漠部族所组成的
My army is made up of tribes.

1121
02:27:08,743 --> 02:27:11,558
部族是由族长所领导
The tribes are led by the tribal leaders.

1122
02:27:11,871 --> 02:27:15,208
你的人民很尊重劳伦斯少校吗？
Your people do think very highly of Major Lawrence?

1123
02:27:15,208 --> 02:27:18,232
没错，你说的对
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1124
02:27:18,858 --> 02:27:22,090
班特利先生，在这个国家…
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1125
02:27:23,133 --> 02:27:26,366
能够为战争带来胜利的人…
the man who gives victory in battle is prized...

1126
02:27:26,678 --> 02:27:29,181
能得到最高的尊敬
beyond every other man.

1127
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:33,143
我现在就可以告诉你一个人…
One figure I can give you f rom my head...

1128
02:27:33,456 --> 02:27:37,002
因为我从没忘记过
because it never leaves my head.

1129
02:27:37,627 --> 02:27:42,320
自从四个月前开始这项行动后 我们有…
Since starting this campaign four months ago, we have lost...

1130
02:27:42,633 --> 02:27:44,927
三十七人受伤…
37 wounded...

1131
02:27:47,533 --> 02:27:50,766
一百五十六人死亡
156 dead.

1132
02:27:52,434 --> 02:27:57,127
请注意死伤人数的比例不平衡
You remark the disproportion between our dead and wounded.

1133
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:58,587
对
Yeah.

1134
02:27:59,004 --> 02:28:00,359
死者比伤者多了四倍
Four times as many.

1135
02:28:00,672 --> 02:28:05,260
那是因为 我们会杀了受伤太重的人
That's because those too badly wounded to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1136
02:28:05,677 --> 02:28:08,076
我们不会让伤者 落入土耳其人手中
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1137
02:28:08,597 --> 02:28:12,247
-你是说…？ -我们不会让伤者落入敌人手中
- You mean...? - We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1138
02:28:12,768 --> 02:28:16,105
在他们的眼中 我们不是士兵而是叛徒
In their eyes, we are not soldiers but rebels.

1139
02:28:16,418 --> 02:28:20,589
叛徒不管是受伤还是健全 都不受日内瓦公约保护…
Rebels, wounded or whole, are not protected by the Geneva Code...

1140
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:22,883
而且被敌人残忍地虐待着
and are treated harshly.

1141
02:28:23,717 --> 02:28:24,760
有多残忍？
How harshly?

1142
02:28:24,968 --> 02:28:27,784
那种情况是你想像不到的
More harshly than I hope you can imagine.

1143
02:28:28,722 --> 02:28:29,661
我懂了
I see.

1144
02:28:29,869 --> 02:28:33,102
我们的囚犯受到妥善照顾 直到我们…
Our own prisoners are taken care of until the British...

1145
02:28:33,415 --> 02:28:37,377
根据公约把他们放给英国人
can relieve us of them, according to the Code.

1146
02:28:37,377 --> 02:28:41,444
-我希望你能记住这一点 -是的，先生
- I should like you to notice that. - Yes, sir.

1147
02:28:42,487 --> 02:28:45,093
那是劳伦斯少校的影响吗？
Is that the influence of Major Lawrence?

1148
02:28:45,615 --> 02:28:46,866
你为什么会那么想？
Why should you suppose?

1149
02:28:47,179 --> 02:28:49,786
只是我在开罗听说…
It's just that I heard in Cairo that...

1150
02:28:49,786 --> 02:28:52,184
劳伦斯少校讨厌杀人
Major Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.

1151
02:28:52,497 --> 02:28:54,165
事实的确如此
That is exactly so.

1152
02:28:54,374 --> 02:28:57,815
对劳伦斯少校而言 仁慈是他所爱的
With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion.

1153
02:28:58,232 --> 02:29:01,048
对我来说那只是一种好礼貌
With me, it is merely good manners.

1154
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:05,323
你可以判断 哪一项动机比较信得过
You may judge which motive is the more reliable.

1155
02:29:06,157 --> 02:29:09,390
-好了，或许… -当然
- And now, perhaps... - Oh, sure, sure.

1156
02:29:13,665 --> 02:29:15,229
谢谢您，先生
Thank you, sir.

1157
02:29:15,542 --> 02:29:17,210
你能把信写得…？
Can you manage the letter--?

1158
02:29:17,523 --> 02:29:20,547
我会实践我说过的话…
I'll do everything I have said...

1159
02:29:20,547 --> 02:29:23,988
只要你诚实地告诉我 你为何对…
if you will tell me truly the nature of your interest...

1160
02:29:24,301 --> 02:29:26,699
我的人民跟劳伦斯少校的事有兴趣
in my people and Major Lawrence.

1161
02:29:28,576 --> 02:29:31,913
很简单，先生 我在寻找一个英雄
It's very simple, sir. I'm looking for a hero.

1162
02:29:31,913 --> 02:29:34,416
没错，你看起来 不像是个浪漫的人
Indeed. You do not seem a romantic man.

1163
02:29:34,833 --> 02:29:35,771
对
Oh, no.

1164
02:29:36,084 --> 02:29:39,838
但我老家那些有影响力的人相信…
But influential men back home believe it's time for America...

1165
02:29:40,151 --> 02:29:42,758
美国该挺身而出对抗德国
to lend her weight to the struggle against Germany.

1166
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:45,052
跟土耳其
And Turkey.

1167
02:29:45,469 --> 02:29:49,431
我来采访新闻 告诉我的国人这场战争…
I've been sent to find material to show our people that this war is...

1168
02:29:50,265 --> 02:29:52,872
-很好玩？ -不是那样的，先生
- Enjoyable? - Hardly that, sir.

1169
02:29:52,872 --> 02:29:55,792
是用更冒险的角度来报导它
But to show it in its more adventurous aspects.

1170
02:29:56,105 --> 02:29:59,650
你在寻找一个能让 你的国家参战的人
You look for a figure who will draw your country towards war.

1171
02:30:01,319 --> 02:30:02,987
好吧，对
All right. Yes.

1172
02:30:03,717 --> 02:30:05,281
劳伦斯是你要的人
Lawrence is your man.

1173
02:30:45,219 --> 02:30:46,261
停火！
Stop!

1174
02:31:05,657 --> 02:31:07,221
停火！
Stop it!

1175
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:09,410
停火！
Stop it!

1176
02:31:17,648 --> 02:31:19,108
快点，大伙们！
Come on, men!

1177
02:32:28,451 --> 02:32:29,494
劳伦斯！
Lawrence!

1178
02:32:50,453 --> 02:32:52,330
天啊！
Good God! God!

1179
02:33:38,733 --> 02:33:43,529
吉米尼！我从没看过 有人这样被剑杀死
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed with a sword before.

1180
02:33:43,842 --> 02:33:46,032
你为什么不照张相呢？
Why don't you take a picture?

1181
02:33:46,449 --> 02:33:47,596
我希望我照了
Wish I had.

1182
02:33:51,976 --> 02:33:54,165
你好吗？劳伦斯
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1183
02:33:56,459 --> 02:33:57,294
我在里面吗？
Am I in this?

1184
02:33:58,441 --> 02:34:00,005
你有帮他拍照吗？
Did you take his picture?

1185
02:34:00,318 --> 02:34:01,569
拍了
Yeah.

1186
02:34:06,053 --> 02:34:10,015
很快地你的九条命都会没了
You are using up your nine lives very quickly.

1187
02:34:12,726 --> 02:34:14,708
你的同伴挺不错的
Charming company you keep.

1188
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:16,272
奥达？
Auda?

1189
02:34:17,106 --> 02:34:22,007
他有点老古板，他觉得 这些东西会吸走他的灵魂
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks these things will steal his virtue.

1190
02:34:22,528 --> 02:34:24,509
他觉得你是小偷
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1191
02:34:24,822 --> 02:34:26,804
可以替你拍张照吗？
It's all right to take your picture?

1192
02:34:27,533 --> 02:34:28,993
-好吧 -好
- All right. - Okay.

1193
02:34:29,202 --> 02:34:30,662
走吧
Just walk.

1194
02:35:30,933 --> 02:35:32,914
劳伦斯少校！
Major Lawrence!

1195
02:35:33,644 --> 02:35:36,355
对，这才是我的宝贝
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1196
02:35:44,384 --> 02:35:46,991
这种洗劫的行为得停止！
This looting has got to stop!

1197
02:35:47,304 --> 02:35:48,451
这是习俗
It is customary.

1198
02:35:48,868 --> 02:35:52,309
这是偷窃，小偷才会偷东西
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1199
02:35:52,726 --> 02:35:54,812
我不会那么跟奥达说
I would not say that to Auda.

1200
02:35:55,438 --> 02:35:58,149
-那是他们的薪水，上校 -薪水
- It is their payment, colonel. - Payment.

1201
02:35:58,462 --> 02:36:01,173
真的，英国士兵没有薪水吗？
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1202
02:36:02,111 --> 02:36:05,344
-他们拿了薪水就不想回家 -他们无法自由回家
- They don't go home when being paid. - They are not free to.

1203
02:36:10,245 --> 02:36:14,207
你再不会看到他们了
Well, there's another lot you've seen the last of.

1204
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:16,188
他们会回来的
They'll come back.

1205
02:36:17,023 --> 02:36:19,838
他说他们会回来，会吗？
He says they'll come back. Will they?

1206
02:36:20,255 --> 02:36:22,341
今年不会，劳伦斯
Not this year, Lawrence.

1207
02:36:23,279 --> 02:36:27,450
听着，劳伦斯，你觉得你们 会剩下多少人？两百人吗？
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you think you'll have left? 200?

1208
02:36:27,867 --> 02:36:30,578
-会更少 -那么是多少？
- Less. - Well, then?

1209
02:36:30,995 --> 02:36:33,289
我说过他们会回来的
I said, they'll come back.

1210
02:36:34,019 --> 02:36:35,166
你伤的很重吗？
You badly hurt?

1211
02:36:36,731 --> 02:36:38,503
我根本没受伤
Not hurt at all.

1212
02:36:38,712 --> 02:36:42,779
你不知道吗？ 他们只有用金子弹才杀得了我
Didn't you know? They can only kill me with a golden bullet.

1213
02:36:48,722 --> 02:36:51,955
(小市民，我们的国会)

1214
02:36:58,628 --> 02:37:02,487
这是给孩子的书 我得督促自己再学一次
It is for children. I have set myself to learn again.

1215
02:37:03,008 --> 02:37:06,449
-你从这件事里学到什么？ -政治
- What are you learning from this? - Politics.

1216
02:37:07,179 --> 02:37:11,350
你会在本国行民主政治吗？ 你会成立国会吗？
You'll be a democracy in this country? You gonna have a parliament?

1217
02:37:12,393 --> 02:37:14,582
当我成立了国家 我再回答你这些问题
I will tell you that when I have a country.

1218
02:37:16,877 --> 02:37:18,128
我回答得好吗？
Did I answer well?

1219
02:37:18,545 --> 02:37:22,612
你回答了，但什么都没说 那就是政治
You answered without saying anything. That's politics.

1220
02:37:23,967 --> 02:37:25,531
你学的很快
You learn quickly.

1221
02:37:26,991 --> 02:37:29,077
我有一个好老师
I have a good teacher.

1222
02:37:31,892 --> 02:37:33,143
对
Yeah.

1223
02:37:40,964 --> 02:37:42,945
-你伤得如何？ -我很好
- How's your hurt? - Fine.

1224
02:37:42,945 --> 02:37:47,742
在我回到战场前 而且我非常乐意那么做
Before I return to the fleshpots, which I shall be very glad to do...

1225
02:37:48,055 --> 02:37:51,079
我能直接地问你两个问题吗？
may I put two questions to you, straight?

1226
02:37:51,392 --> 02:37:54,520
我想听你直接地问一个问题
I'd be interested to hear you put a question straight.

1227
02:37:54,833 --> 02:37:55,980
一
One.

1228
02:37:56,605 --> 02:38:00,464
你觉得这些人希望从 这场战争里得到什么？
What, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war?

1229
02:38:00,776 --> 02:38:03,175
他们希望获得他们的自由
They hope to gain their freedom.

1230
02:38:04,530 --> 02:38:05,469
自由
Freedom.

1231
02:38:06,824 --> 02:38:09,640
“他们希望获得他们的自由”
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1232
02:38:09,953 --> 02:38:13,602
-他们受骗了 -他们会得到自由的
- There's one born every minute. - They're going to get it.

1233
02:38:14,332 --> 02:38:16,522
我会让他们得到自由的
I'm going to give it to them.

1234
02:38:18,295 --> 02:38:23,926
-第二个问题呢？ -我要问的是…
The second question?

1235
02:38:21,048 --> 02:38:24,092
Well, I was going to ask...

1236
02:38:24,551 --> 02:38:28,514
沙漠是什么地方吸引你呢？
what is it that attracts you personally to the desert?

1237
02:38:30,495 --> 02:38:32,476
它很干净
It's clean.

1238
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:36,856
好了
Well, now...

1239
02:38:37,898 --> 02:38:39,880
那是个很棒的答案
that's a very illuminating answer.

1240
02:38:40,401 --> 02:38:41,861
我可以…
May I...

1241
02:38:42,695 --> 02:38:45,093
拍一张告别照片吗？
take one farewell picture?

1242
02:38:45,928 --> 02:38:48,952
我给麦斯巴德两个灯才换到它
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1243
02:38:49,264 --> 02:38:52,184
一个钟换两个灯
One clock for two lamps.

1244
02:38:52,810 --> 02:38:53,853
一项很公平的交易
A fair bargain.

1245
02:38:54,165 --> 02:38:56,772
公平？我是在抢劫他
Fair? I robbed him.

1246
02:39:08,243 --> 02:39:09,702
垃圾
Trash.

1247
02:39:10,849 --> 02:39:13,248
我得找到一些荣耀的东西
I must find something honorable.

1248
02:39:13,561 --> 02:39:15,125
荣耀的东西？
Honorable?

1249
02:39:15,750 --> 02:39:19,504
今年快过完了，布莱顿
The year is running out, Brighton.

1250
02:39:23,988 --> 02:39:26,908
我得找到一些荣耀的东西
I must find something honorable.

1251
02:41:58,524 --> 02:42:00,610
你现在可以炸了我的火车
Now you may blow up my train.

1252
02:42:01,027 --> 02:42:02,591
你要做什么？
And what will you do now?

1253
02:42:02,904 --> 02:42:07,387
我现在要回家 他们把我的玩具载走
Now I go home. They will carry my toys.

1254
02:42:08,222 --> 02:42:10,203
他们也会载我的玩具 你懂吗？
They will carry my toys too, see?

1255
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:13,644
劳伦斯少校 今年冬天会发动攻势
Major Lawrence will campaign this winter.

1256
02:42:13,957 --> 02:42:17,502
但你得到你想要的东西 所以要回家去，对吧？
But you got what you wanted, so you're going home, is that it?

1257
02:42:17,502 --> 02:42:22,090
当然，当劳伦斯得到他 想要的东西，他会回家去的
Of course. When Lawrence has got what he wants, he will go home.

1258
02:42:22,403 --> 02:42:24,906
当你得到你想要的东西时 你也会回家去的
When you've got what you want, you will go home.

1259
02:42:25,219 --> 02:42:26,678
不，我不会的，奥达
No, I shan't, Auda.

1260
02:42:27,617 --> 02:42:28,972
那么你是个笨蛋
Then you are a fool.

1261
02:42:29,702 --> 02:42:32,622
或许吧，我不是个逃兵
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1262
02:42:33,769 --> 02:42:35,959
谢天谢地，布莱顿
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1263
02:42:36,272 --> 02:42:39,296
当他把你变成一个呆瓜时 他也让你一脸的呆相
that when He made you a fool, He gave you a fool's face.

1264
02:42:40,547 --> 02:42:42,633
你是个无礼的混蛋
You are an impudent rascal.

1265
02:42:44,197 --> 02:42:48,368
我得走了，劳伦斯 不然我也要成为笨蛋了
I must go, Lawrence, before I soil myself with a fool's blood.

1266
02:42:59,004 --> 02:43:00,672
我像是在对牛弹琴
Like talking to a brick wall.

1267
02:43:09,431 --> 02:43:12,038
你现在要做什么？ 你能做什么？
So what will you do now? What can you do?

1268
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:14,436
我要往北走
I'll go north.

1269
02:43:15,792 --> 02:43:17,565
那就是艾伦比想要的
That's what Allenby wants.

1270
02:43:17,878 --> 02:43:21,944
艾伦比要阿拉伯军队撤到迪拉之后
Allenby wanted the Arab army behind Deraa.

1271
02:43:22,257 --> 02:43:24,447
那么我会把他们领到那儿
Then that's where I'll take it.

1272
02:43:25,490 --> 02:43:30,286
叫艾伦比快一点，不然在他 到耶路撒冷前我们就到迪拉了
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1273
02:43:30,599 --> 02:43:31,746
对吧？
Won't we?

1274
02:44:04,280 --> 02:44:05,219
火车，法拉吉
Train, Farraj.

1275
02:44:06,366 --> 02:44:07,825
对，劳伦斯
Yeah, Lawrence.

1276
02:44:37,127 --> 02:44:38,795
躲起来，我的朋友
Hide yourself, my friend.

1277
02:44:48,076 --> 02:44:49,536
引爆器
Detonator.

1278
02:45:03,091 --> 02:45:04,760
好了，再拿一个来
All right, fetch another.

1279
02:45:05,073 --> 02:45:08,722
-对不起，劳伦斯，我放… -时间还很多，再拿一个来
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put-- - Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1280
02:45:14,249 --> 02:45:15,500
法拉吉？
Farraj?

1281
02:45:25,928 --> 02:45:28,952
-发生什么事了？ -引爆器！…
- What happened? - Detonator. A detonator!

1282
02:45:42,507 --> 02:45:44,906
他无法骑乘了
He cannot ride.

1283
02:45:54,499 --> 02:45:57,314
如果他们活抓他 你知道他们会如何折磨他的
If they take him alive, you know what they'll do to him.

1284
02:46:09,723 --> 02:46:12,122
杜德会生你气的
Daud will be angry with you.

1285
02:46:13,269 --> 02:46:15,041
帮我向他致意
Salute him for me.

1286
02:46:34,436 --> 02:46:36,001
你现在要做什么？
What will you do now?

1287
02:46:37,565 --> 02:46:39,233
往北走
Go north.

1288
02:46:39,233 --> 02:46:40,589
只带二十个人？
With twenty?

1289
02:46:41,527 --> 02:46:43,926
你建议我该怎么做呢？
What would you recommend me to do?

1290
02:46:45,698 --> 02:46:47,784
你会如何建议呢？
What would you recommend?

1291
02:46:52,789 --> 02:46:55,187
他手下的人不到十分之一
He hasn't 1l10 so many men, sir.

1292
02:46:55,187 --> 02:46:57,064
事实上他在骗人
He's lied, in fact.

1293
02:46:58,524 --> 02:47:02,174
对也不对，他没说 他有做出他根本没做的事
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have done anything he hasn't done.

1294
02:47:02,487 --> 02:47:04,989
那么就有一队阿拉伯北军罗
Then there is an Arab north army.

1295
02:47:06,658 --> 02:47:10,829
-不，长官，他在这一点说谎 -你知道为什么吗？
- No, sir, he has lied about that. - Any idea why?

1296
02:47:11,558 --> 02:47:15,417
-我想那是他的军队 -那是费萨尔王子的军队
- It's his army, I suppose. - It's Prince Feisal's army.

1297
02:47:16,981 --> 02:47:19,379
你觉得他会被同化吗？哈利
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1298
02:47:20,839 --> 02:47:22,299
不会的
No.

1299
02:47:23,446 --> 02:47:27,096
我想如果可以的话，他会的
He would if he could, I think.

1300
02:47:28,972 --> 02:47:32,309
-就我对国家的观念不会的 -这不重要，我只是好奇
- Not my line of country. - It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1301
02:47:33,143 --> 02:47:35,333
重要的是我相信它
What matters is I believed it.

1302
02:47:35,646 --> 02:47:37,210
土耳其人相信它
The Turks believe it.

1303
02:47:37,627 --> 02:47:40,964
他们提供两万镑在悬赏他
They are offering 20, 000 pounds for him.

1304
02:47:42,945 --> 02:47:44,614
天啊
Good heavens.

1305
02:47:45,135 --> 02:47:48,889
-看来他活不久了 -他是个勇敢的人…
- Shouldn't say he had long to live. - Well, he's a brave man--

1306
02:47:49,098 --> 02:47:53,269
没错，如果他还敢带 五十个人北行，他的确很有种
Surely. If he's still going north with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1307
02:47:54,624 --> 02:47:57,335
不知道他们 会不会出这么多钱来悬赏我
I wonder if they'd offer that much for me.

1308
02:47:59,108 --> 02:48:03,175
明年呢？他们还会回来吗？
What about next year? Will they still come back?

1309
02:48:03,592 --> 02:48:05,469
我并不讶异
I wouldn't be surprised.

1310
02:48:05,782 --> 02:48:09,223
-他们觉得他是圣徒？ -是他们或是他？
- They think he's a kind of prophet. - They do or he does?

1311
02:48:24,968 --> 02:48:27,471
-我可以说句话吗？ -当然可以
- Now may I speak? - Yes.

1312
02:48:28,201 --> 02:48:31,225
再失败一次 你会发现自己孤独一人
One more failure and you will find yourself alone.

1313
02:48:32,789 --> 02:48:36,126
-不包括我 -不包括其他人
- I do not include myself. - I do not include the others.

1314
02:48:36,543 --> 02:48:38,628
他们爱你
So say they love you.

1315
02:48:39,150 --> 02:48:41,548
更应该对他们要求低些
The more reason to be thrifty with them.

1316
02:48:41,861 --> 02:48:44,989
给他们做的好的任务 但你没那么做
Give them something to do that can be done. But you, no.

1317
02:48:45,302 --> 02:48:47,387
他们得移开高山 在水面上行走
They must move mountains, walk on water.

1318
02:48:47,700 --> 02:48:50,724
没错
That's right. That's right.

1319
02:48:51,454 --> 02:48:53,957
你凭什么知道人能做什么事？
Who are you to know what can be done?

1320
02:48:54,478 --> 02:48:57,919
若我们完成你觉得可以 做到的事，我们早在延布了
If we'd done what you thought could be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1321
02:48:58,649 --> 02:49:02,820
我要他们做到的事都能做得到 你不明白，他们也明白
Whatever I ask them to do can be done. They know that if you don't.

1322
02:49:05,114 --> 02:49:08,034
你认为我只是一个普通人？
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1323
02:49:08,660 --> 02:49:09,911
是吗？
Do you?

1324
02:49:13,248 --> 02:49:16,585
我的朋友谁要跟我走在水面上？
My friends, who will walk on water with me?

1325
02:49:20,026 --> 02:49:24,197
-谁要跟我进入迪拉？ -迪拉戒备森严
- Who will come with me into Deraa? - Deraa is garrisoned.

1326
02:49:24,614 --> 02:49:26,699
你要以二十人攻打两千人？
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1327
02:49:27,012 --> 02:49:30,870
-如果有必要，我会自己去 -为什么？
- I'll go by myself if I have to. - Why?

1328
02:49:30,870 --> 02:49:32,643
我告诉英国将军…
I told the English generals...

1329
02:49:33,060 --> 02:49:36,605
当他们到耶路撒冷时 阿拉伯暴动会在迪拉
the Arab revolt would be in Deraa when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1330
02:49:37,127 --> 02:49:39,212
或许你是为了英国的将军们…
Or perhaps you are here...

1331
02:49:39,838 --> 02:49:41,715
来到这里
for the English generals.

1332
02:49:43,905 --> 02:49:45,469
谁说的？
Who says this?

1333
02:49:45,782 --> 02:49:47,033
传言是如此
Rumour.

1334
02:49:48,493 --> 02:49:50,891
那不算是争论
That is not an argument.

1335
02:49:51,308 --> 02:49:53,394
争论
Oh, argument.

1336
02:49:53,707 --> 02:49:56,939
今天下午当阿拉伯人还在争论…
This afternoon I will take the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1337
02:49:57,252 --> 02:49:59,546
我要带阿拉伯暴动进入迪拉
while the Arabs argue.

1338
02:50:01,527 --> 02:50:04,655
你能在阿拉伯的村落 假扮成阿拉伯人而不被认出吗？
Can you pass for an Arab in an Arab town?

1339
02:50:05,073 --> 02:50:08,722
可以，如果你们愿意 借我一些脏衣服
Yes. If one of you would lend me some dirty clothes.

1340
02:50:18,211 --> 02:50:19,254
那太疯狂了
It's madness.

1341
02:50:22,904 --> 02:50:24,572
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

1342
02:50:24,885 --> 02:50:27,283
宣布我的到来的方法
Some way to announce myself.

1343
02:50:27,596 --> 02:50:29,473
对他有点耐心，天啊
Be patient with him, God.

1344
02:50:42,925 --> 02:50:46,887
-你不知道他们怎么看你吗？ -冷静，阿里，没人看得到我
- Do you not see how they look at you? - Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1345
02:50:47,408 --> 02:50:48,555
站住！
Halt!

1346
02:50:48,868 --> 02:50:50,120
继续走
Walk on.

1347
02:50:50,328 --> 02:50:52,205
-站住！ -继续走
- Halt! - Walk on.

1348
02:50:53,352 --> 02:50:55,438
你跟你
You and you.

1349
02:52:36,689 --> 02:52:37,732
你
You.

1350
02:52:54,311 --> 02:52:56,293
你的眼珠是蓝色的
You have blue eyes.

1351
02:52:57,231 --> 02:53:01,194
-我说你的眼珠是蓝色的 -对，朋友
- I say you have blue eyes. - Yes, effendi.

1352
02:53:01,715 --> 02:53:04,843
-你是瑟卡新人吗？ -对，朋友
- Are you Circassian? - Yes, effendi.

1353
02:53:05,886 --> 02:53:07,346
你几岁？
How old are you?

1354
02:53:07,659 --> 02:53:10,578
我二十七岁，朋友
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1355
02:53:10,995 --> 02:53:12,768
我想
I think.

1356
02:53:13,081 --> 02:53:17,252
你看起来比实际年龄老 你一定经历过很多事
You look older. You have had a lot of experience.

1357
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:20,902
那是个长得很有趣的脸
It's an interesting face.

1358
02:53:25,594 --> 02:53:27,888
我被牛包围着
I am surrounded by cattle.

1359
02:53:28,722 --> 02:53:32,268
他根本连有趣的脸 是什么都不知道
He wouldn't know an interesting face f rom a sow's belly.

1360
02:53:33,415 --> 02:53:37,273
我到迪拉来三年半了
I have been is Deraa now for three and a half years.

1361
02:53:37,586 --> 02:53:42,174
就是他们把我派到月球背面布岗 我也不会觉得…
If they posted me to the dark side of the moon, I could not be more...

1362
02:53:42,174 --> 02:53:44,051
孤单
isolated.

1363
02:53:46,032 --> 02:53:48,535
你不知道我在说什么
You haven't the least idea what I'm talking about.

1364
02:53:48,952 --> 02:53:50,516
对，朋友
No, effendi.

1365
02:53:53,123 --> 02:53:54,478
是吗？
Have you?

1366
02:53:55,834 --> 02:53:56,981
对
No.

1367
02:53:57,711 --> 02:53:59,483
那真的是…
That would be too...

1368
02:53:59,796 --> 02:54:01,256
太幸运了
lucky.

1369
02:54:25,865 --> 02:54:27,638
你打哪弄来这个？
Where did you get that?

1370
02:54:29,619 --> 02:54:33,581
-这是旧伤了，朋友 -不，这是新的
- It's old, effendi. - No, this is recent.

1371
02:54:35,771 --> 02:54:37,857
-你是个逃兵 -不是的，朋友
- You are a deserter. - No, effendi.

1372
02:54:38,274 --> 02:54:40,151
是，你是个逃兵
Yes, you are a deserter.

1373
02:54:41,298 --> 02:54:43,488
但是从哪个军队逃出来的呢？
But from which army?

1374
02:54:46,094 --> 02:54:48,284
那不重要
Not that it matters at all.

1375
02:54:48,597 --> 02:54:50,891
人不可能老是穿制服
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1376
02:55:02,466 --> 02:55:04,447
你的皮夫很漂亮
Your skin is very fair.

1377
02:55:23,321 --> 02:55:24,572
打他
Beat him.

1378
02:56:59,254 --> 02:57:00,505
给我！
To me!

1379
02:59:03,029 --> 02:59:04,593
睡吧
Sleep.

1380
02:59:06,470 --> 02:59:07,825
睡吧
Sleep.

1381
02:59:19,713 --> 02:59:21,068
吃
Eat.

1382
02:59:26,908 --> 02:59:28,159
吃
Eat.

1383
02:59:32,017 --> 02:59:34,833
你有个跟其他男人一样的身体
You have a body, like other men.

1384
02:59:43,488 --> 02:59:44,426
很好
Good.

1385
02:59:45,677 --> 02:59:47,346
那么睡吧
Then sleep.

1386
03:00:01,006 --> 03:00:02,153
好一点了吗？
Better?

1387
03:00:02,883 --> 03:00:05,490
好多了，你说的对
Much better. You were right.

1388
03:00:05,803 --> 03:00:07,888
休息吧，你学不乖吗？
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1389
03:00:08,931 --> 03:00:10,912
我已经学到教训了
Oh, I've learned all right.

1390
03:00:16,856 --> 03:00:18,420
我要走了，阿里
I'm going, Ali.

1391
03:00:19,567 --> 03:00:21,548
-为什么？ -为什么？
- Why? - Why?

1392
03:00:23,008 --> 03:00:24,155
天啊
Heavens.

1393
03:00:24,572 --> 03:00:25,719
为什么？
Why?

1394
03:00:26,762 --> 03:00:28,847
我想我已经完了
I've come to the end of myself, I suppose.

1395
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:31,141
阿拉伯叛乱呢？
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1396
03:00:31,454 --> 03:00:34,582
我不是阿拉伯叛乱，阿里 我甚至不是阿拉伯人
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali. I'm not even Arab.

1397
03:00:34,895 --> 03:00:37,815
你说人可以变成他想成为的人
A man can be whatever he wants. You said.

1398
03:00:38,128 --> 03:00:41,048
抱歉，我以为那是真的
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1399
03:00:41,360 --> 03:00:43,237
你证明了这一点
You proved it.

1400
03:00:43,550 --> 03:00:45,636
听着，阿里
Look, Ali. Look.

1401
03:00:45,948 --> 03:00:49,702
那是我，是什么颜色？ 那是我
That's me. What colour is it? That's me.

1402
03:00:50,537 --> 03:00:52,726
是我改不了的
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1403
03:00:53,039 --> 03:00:55,646
你说人可以变成他想成为的人
A man can do whatever he wants. You said.

1404
03:00:57,523 --> 03:00:59,191
他可以…
He can...

1405
03:00:59,191 --> 03:01:02,111
但他不能随心所欲
but he can't want what he wants.

1406
03:01:03,050 --> 03:01:06,178
这是决定他要什么的东西
This is the stuff that decides what he wants.

1407
03:01:09,098 --> 03:01:12,747
你也知道吧 我想什么都告诉他们
You may as well know. I would've told them anything.

1408
03:01:13,060 --> 03:01:16,918
我想告诉他们我是谁 我想告诉他们你要去哪里
I would've told them who I am. I would've told them where you were.

1409
03:01:17,231 --> 03:01:19,942
-我试着要说 -任何人都会那么做的
- I tried to. - So would any man.

1410
03:01:20,255 --> 03:01:23,696
我只是个平凡人
Well, any man is what I am.

1411
03:01:24,739 --> 03:01:28,701
我要回去跟艾伦比…
And I'm going back to Allenby to ask him for a job...

1412
03:01:29,118 --> 03:01:30,995
要一个平凡人的工作
that any man can do.

1413
03:01:31,413 --> 03:01:33,289
艾伦比在耶路撒冷
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1414
03:01:33,602 --> 03:01:36,209
-我要做些轻松的事 -你？
- I'll make easy stages. - You?

1415
03:01:37,878 --> 03:01:41,319
对，我要做些轻松的事
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1416
03:01:43,091 --> 03:01:47,575
听着，阿里，我想我可以有…
Look, Ali, I think I see a way of being just...

1417
03:01:47,888 --> 03:01:49,348
一种平凡的…
ordinarily...

1418
03:01:50,078 --> 03:01:51,433
快乐
happy.

1419
03:01:55,396 --> 03:01:56,856
我能拿走这个吗？
Can I take this?

1420
03:01:57,586 --> 03:01:59,463
它不干净喔
It is not clean.

1421
03:01:59,775 --> 03:02:02,695
对，但是很温暖
No, but it's warm.

1422
03:02:03,216 --> 03:02:04,364
他们呢…
And these...

1423
03:02:04,676 --> 03:02:08,535
带领他们到这里来 你不在乎他们吗？
having led them here, have you no care for them?

1424
03:02:10,203 --> 03:02:15,312
你带领他们，他们是你的了 相信你的人民
You lead them. They're yours. Trust your own people.

1425
03:02:17,606 --> 03:02:19,692
让我回到我的人民身边
And let me go back to mine.

1426
03:02:48,889 --> 03:02:52,017
-别忘了那些五人小组 -好吧
- I say, don't forget those form fives. - All right.

1427
03:02:57,857 --> 03:02:59,734
介意我加入吗？
Mind if I join you?

1428
03:03:00,568 --> 03:03:02,132
这是我的荣幸
Honoured, sir.

1429
03:03:04,635 --> 03:03:07,763
-回来了真好 -我们都听说你回来了，先生
- Good to be back. - We heard you were, sir.

1430
03:03:08,493 --> 03:03:10,891
-那边发生了什么事？ -哪里？
- What's doing out there? - Where?

1431
03:03:11,308 --> 03:03:13,498
-阿拉伯？ -是的，先生
- Arabia? - Well, yes, sir.

1432
03:03:13,811 --> 03:03:16,939
没什么，现在是淡季 这里呢？
Nothing much. Wrong time of year. What's doing here?

1433
03:03:17,356 --> 03:03:19,650
我们在安顿 我们盖了一座球场
We're settling in. We built a squash court.

1434
03:03:19,963 --> 03:03:21,423
太好了
Jolly good.

1435
03:03:22,257 --> 03:03:26,220
我得上去了
Well, I have to go up there.

1436
03:03:27,158 --> 03:03:29,556
那是借来的 有人把我的偷走了
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1437
03:03:29,869 --> 03:03:31,538
真是混蛋
Bloody wogs.

1438
03:03:33,102 --> 03:03:34,874
对啊，或许吧
Yes, probably.

1439
03:03:35,709 --> 03:03:38,003
球场那件事真是个好主意
Jolly good about the squash court.

1440
03:03:40,818 --> 03:03:43,216
他太夸张了，对吧？
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1441
03:03:56,564 --> 03:03:58,024
早安
Morning.

1442
03:03:58,024 --> 03:03:59,692
-早安 -回来了真好
- Good morning. - Good to be back.

1443
03:04:00,109 --> 03:04:03,029
-我相信你，先生 -不，是真的
- I'll believe you, sir. - No, really it is.

1444
03:04:06,366 --> 03:04:07,721
嗨
Hello.

1445
03:04:08,243 --> 03:04:11,371
早安，直走进去
Morning. You're to go right in.

1446
03:04:23,467 --> 03:04:24,927
劳伦斯
Lawrence.

1447
03:04:26,804 --> 03:04:29,202
或我该叫你劳伦斯少校？
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1448
03:04:30,036 --> 03:04:31,287
长官
Sir.

1449
03:04:37,127 --> 03:04:38,899
将军，我要离开了
Well, general, I will leave you.

1450
03:04:39,317 --> 03:04:42,132
劳伦斯少校毫无疑问地要报告…
Major Lawrence doubtless has reports to make...

1451
03:04:42,445 --> 03:04:46,199
关于我的人民跟他们的弱点…
about my people and their weakness...

1452
03:04:46,512 --> 03:04:51,204
及让英国对他们 保持利益权的必要
and the need to keep them in the British interest.

1453
03:04:53,811 --> 03:04:57,460
法国人也有利益权 我们别忘了法国人
And the French interest too. We must not forget the French.

1454
03:04:57,460 --> 03:04:59,546
我说过了并没有这样的条约限制
I told you, no such treaty exists.

1455
03:04:59,755 --> 03:05:04,238
对，将军，你很勇敢地说谎 但说服力却不够
Yes, general, you have lied most bravely, but not convincingly.

1456
03:05:04,551 --> 03:05:06,428
我知道的确有条约存在
I know this treaty does exist.

1457
03:05:06,845 --> 03:05:08,618
条约？
Treaty, sir?

1458
03:05:10,912 --> 03:05:12,789
他的表演比你好，将军
He does it better than you, general.

1459
03:05:13,102 --> 03:05:16,334
当然他可以说是个阿拉伯人
But then, of course, he is almost an Arab.

1460
03:05:30,620 --> 03:05:32,184
你真的不知道吗？
You really don't know?

1461
03:05:34,478 --> 03:05:36,459
那么这到底是怎么一回事？
Then what the devil's this?

1462
03:05:37,502 --> 03:05:41,256
是我要求调离阿拉伯的申请信 先生
It's my request for release from Arabia, sir.

1463
03:05:41,673 --> 03:05:43,237
为什么？
Why? Are you sure you haven't heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1464
03:05:43,237 --> 03:05:45,427
你确定你没听说过 史凯奇皮哥特条约？

1465
03:05:45,740 --> 03:05:46,991
我没听过
No.

1466
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:51,058
-我猜想得到 -别猜了，告诉他吧
- I can guess. - Don't guess. Tell him.

1467
03:05:52,935 --> 03:05:54,186
好了
Well, now...

1468
03:05:54,708 --> 03:05:57,627
史凯奇先生是一名英国公使
Mr. Sykes is as English civil servant.

1469
03:05:58,044 --> 03:06:00,964
皮哥特先生是一名法国公使
Monsieur Picot is a French civil servant.

1470
03:06:01,277 --> 03:06:04,405
史凯奇跟皮哥特见面 他们同意在战后…
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met, and they agreed that after the war...

1471
03:06:05,761 --> 03:06:08,993
英法该共享土耳其帝国
France and England should share the Turkish Empire.

1472
03:06:09,410 --> 03:06:10,975
包括阿拉伯在内
Including Arabia.

1473
03:06:11,287 --> 03:06:15,354
他们签订同意书而不是和约
They signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir.

1474
03:06:15,563 --> 03:06:18,691
同意书是有法律效力的
An agreement to that effect.

1475
03:06:19,421 --> 03:06:22,862
小偷之间或许还有尊严 但政客是无耻的
There may be honour among thieves, but there's none in politicians.

1476
03:06:23,175 --> 03:06:25,886
我们别生气
And let's have no displays of indignation.

1477
03:06:26,303 --> 03:06:29,327
你也许还不知道 但你有怀疑
You may not have known, but you certainly had suspicions.

1478
03:06:29,953 --> 03:06:33,394
如果我们是在说谎 你有一半也是在说谎
If we've told lies, you've told half-lies.

1479
03:06:33,394 --> 03:06:37,565
像我这样说谎的人 只是在隐瞒事实
And a man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth.

1480
03:06:38,086 --> 03:06:42,779
但说一半谎话的人 忘了事实是什么
But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it.

1481
03:06:43,404 --> 03:06:46,741
真相是我是个普通人
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1482
03:06:47,262 --> 03:06:49,556
你已经跟我说过了，戴丹
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1483
03:06:51,121 --> 03:06:52,997
我要一份普通的工作
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1484
03:06:53,415 --> 03:06:55,604
那是我辞职的原因
That's my reason for resigning.

1485
03:06:57,064 --> 03:06:58,524
是因为私人的因素
It's personal.

1486
03:06:58,837 --> 03:07:00,922
-私人的因素？ -是的，长官
- Personal? - Yes, sir.

1487
03:07:01,340 --> 03:07:04,364
私人的因素？ 你可是一名公职军官
Personal? You're a serving officer in the field.

1488
03:07:04,572 --> 03:07:07,909
事实上你是一个 很重要的人物，你疯了吗？
And as it happens, a damned important one. Are you mad?

1489
03:07:08,326 --> 03:07:11,454
不，如果你不介意的话 我不想发疯
No, and if you don't mind, I'd rather not go mad.

1490
03:07:11,767 --> 03:07:13,957
那也是我的理由
That's my reason too.

1491
03:07:13,957 --> 03:07:19,171
听着，下个月十六号 我在大马士革有个大计划
Look, I'm making my big push on Damascus the 16th of next month...

1492
03:07:19,171 --> 03:07:21,048
你是其中的一部份
and you are part of it.

1493
03:07:21,569 --> 03:07:25,219
你明白吗？你是一个 大计划中重要的一部份！
Can you understand that? You're an important part of the big push!

1494
03:07:25,531 --> 03:07:29,390
我不要成为你的大计划中的一部份！
I don't want to be part of your big push!

1495
03:07:30,224 --> 03:07:32,101
那么你的阿拉伯朋友呢？
What about your Arab friends?

1496
03:07:32,518 --> 03:07:36,272
我没有阿拉伯朋友！ 我不要阿拉伯朋友！
I have no Arab friends! I don't want Arab friends!

1497
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:38,670
你到底要什么？劳伦斯
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1498
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:43,988
我说过了，我只想当个普通人
I've told you, I just want my ration of common humanity.

1499
03:07:44,301 --> 03:07:47,116
-劳伦斯 -什么？
- Lawrence. - Yes?

1500
03:07:49,932 --> 03:07:52,643
没什么，抱歉打断你们了
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1501
03:07:52,956 --> 03:07:54,937
没关系，谢谢你，戴丹先生
That's all right. Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1502
03:07:55,354 --> 03:07:56,918
谢谢你
Thank you, sir.

1503
03:07:58,170 --> 03:08:00,255
我们为什么不…？
Why don't we...?

1504
03:08:02,966 --> 03:08:04,635
你背上有血
There's blood on your back.

1505
03:08:05,990 --> 03:08:09,014
-你要看医生吗？ -不必了
- Do you want a doctor? - No.

1506
03:08:10,370 --> 03:08:12,455
告诉我发生了什么事
Tell me what happened.

1507
03:08:17,460 --> 03:08:19,546
哎呀，那里发生了什么事？
Say, what goes on in there?

1508
03:08:20,380 --> 03:08:22,257
-没什么 -少来了！
- Nothing. - Oh, come on!

1509
03:08:22,570 --> 03:08:25,803
-真的没什么，什么事都没有 -他有麻烦了吗？
- No, really. Nothing at all. - Is the man in trouble?

1510
03:08:26,115 --> 03:08:30,078
应该如此，我们都有麻烦 生活充满了麻烦
I expect so. We all have troubles. Life's a vale of troubles.

1511
03:08:30,286 --> 03:08:34,145
他有麻烦就告诉我 我得保护他
Let me know if the man's in trouble. I've got a claim in that man.

1512
03:08:34,562 --> 03:08:37,794
-为什么？ -我让那孩子成了英雄
- What claim? - I've made that boy a hero.

1513
03:08:38,107 --> 03:08:40,818
当战争结束后 他想做什么都可以
When the war's over, he can be anything he wants.

1514
03:08:41,131 --> 03:08:45,093
是，现在他想当别人
Yes. Well, at the moment he wants to be somebody else.

1515
03:08:45,928 --> 03:08:48,743
麻烦借过一下，好吗？
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1516
03:08:49,369 --> 03:08:51,767
逃避吧，戴丹
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1517
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:54,687
总是在逃避，不是吗？
Always walking away, aren't you?

1518
03:08:55,104 --> 03:08:56,564
告诉你吧
Well, I'll tell you.

1519
03:08:56,877 --> 03:08:59,692
那里正在爆发脾气上的冲突
It's a clash of temperament that's going on in there.

1520
03:09:00,005 --> 03:09:02,820
不可避免地他们有一个半疯了
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1521
03:09:03,133 --> 03:09:05,844
一个完全寡廉鲜耻
and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1522
03:09:06,783 --> 03:09:09,702
我相信你的名字将会家喻户晓
I believe your name will be a household word...

1523
03:09:10,328 --> 03:09:13,978
而要知道谁是艾伦比 还要去战争博物馆查
when you'd have to go to the war museum to find who Allenby was.

1524
03:09:14,812 --> 03:09:17,732
你是我见过最不凡的人
You're the most extraordinary man I ever met.

1525
03:09:18,357 --> 03:09:19,713
别来烦我
Leave me alone.

1526
03:09:20,130 --> 03:09:22,841
-别来烦我 -真软弱的句子
- Leave me alone. - That's a feeble thing to say.

1527
03:09:22,841 --> 03:09:25,448
-我知道我不平凡 -我不是那个意思
- I know I'm not ordinary. - That's not what I'm saying.

1528
03:09:25,761 --> 03:09:28,472
好吧，我很不凡
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1529
03:09:30,453 --> 03:09:31,392
那又怎么样？
What of it?

1530
03:09:31,913 --> 03:09:34,520
不是很多人都注定好要成为伟人的 劳伦斯
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.

1531
03:09:34,833 --> 03:09:37,857
注定该成为伟大的人却感到害怕 那真的是太糟糕了
It's a terrible thing for a man to funk it if he has.

1532
03:09:38,170 --> 03:09:40,255
这是你的经验谈吗？
Are you speaking from experience?

1533
03:09:40,672 --> 03:09:42,132
不是
No.

1534
03:09:42,132 --> 03:09:43,905
那么是你的猜测
You're guessing, then.

1535
03:09:45,156 --> 03:09:46,407
我猜你错了
Suppose you're wrong.

1536
03:09:46,824 --> 03:09:49,744
你为什么会那么说？ 我们都知道我是对的
Why suppose that? We both know I'm right.

1537
03:09:50,683 --> 03:09:53,498
-对，我说对 -毕竟…
- Yes. I said, yes. - After all--

1538
03:09:56,209 --> 03:09:58,190
-十六号？ -你办得到吗？
The 16th?

1539
03:09:58,399 --> 03:10:00,484
我会给你很多钱
Can you do it? I'll give you a lot of money.

1540
03:10:00,797 --> 03:10:03,508
-大炮呢？ -我办不到
- Artillery? - I can't.

1541
03:10:04,864 --> 03:10:07,784
他们要的不是钱 他们当中的豪杰不是那么想的
They won't be coming for money, not the best of them.

1542
03:10:08,097 --> 03:10:10,286
他们要的是大马士革
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1543
03:10:11,329 --> 03:10:13,310
我会给他们大马士革
Which I'm going to give them.

1544
03:10:14,145 --> 03:10:15,813
那是我想要的
That's all I want.

1545
03:10:16,960 --> 03:10:19,880
你要我们夺走土耳其人的权利
All you want is someone holding down the Turkish Right.

1546
03:10:20,192 --> 03:10:24,155
但我会给他们大马士革的 我们会抢在你们之前赶到
But I'm going to give them Damascus. We'll get there before you do.

1547
03:10:24,676 --> 03:10:27,700
我们夺下它之后就要留下它
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1548
03:10:28,013 --> 03:10:30,307
叫那些政客现在烧了他们的合约
Tell the politicians to burn their paper now.

1549
03:10:30,620 --> 03:10:31,976
很公平
Fair enough.

1550
03:10:32,601 --> 03:10:35,312
公平？公平与此事何干？
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1551
03:10:36,147 --> 03:10:37,919
这是会发生的
It's going to happen.

1552
03:10:38,753 --> 03:10:40,735
我要很多钱
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1553
03:10:41,569 --> 03:10:43,133
所有的钱都是你的
All there is.

1554
03:10:43,759 --> 03:10:45,219
不要那么多
Not that much.

1555
03:10:48,660 --> 03:10:51,371
他们的当中的豪杰不是要钱的
The best of them won't come for money.

1556
03:10:53,352 --> 03:10:54,603
他们要的是我
They'll come for me.

1557
03:11:13,164 --> 03:11:14,311
别拍照！
No pictures!

1558
03:11:14,728 --> 03:11:16,918
不是要拍你，是要拍劳伦斯
It's not for you, it's for Lawrence.

1559
03:11:17,231 --> 03:11:21,298
他不介意拍照 他一点都不介意
He doesn't mind having his picture taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1560
03:11:21,611 --> 03:11:23,905
全世界只有一个劳伦斯
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1561
03:11:28,493 --> 03:11:30,995
劳伦斯回来后 你跟他见过面吗？
Have you met Lawrence since he's come back?

1562
03:11:31,308 --> 03:11:32,768
见过
Yes.

1563
03:11:32,768 --> 03:11:35,062
-他变了，对吗？ -没有
- Changed, hasn't he? - No.

1564
03:11:35,375 --> 03:11:38,190
我说他变了 他变成一个不一样的人了
Oh, I'd say he had. Different man, I'd say.

1565
03:11:42,987 --> 03:11:46,532
那个土耳其将军在迪拉对他做了什么？
What did that Turkish general do to him in Deraa?

1566
03:11:47,367 --> 03:11:52,059
他在离开迪拉后还是一样 他只是谦卑了
He was the same man after Deraa. The same man, humbled.

1567
03:11:53,832 --> 03:11:56,230
英国人在耶路撒冷对他做了什么？
What did the English do to him in Jerusalem?

1568
03:11:56,647 --> 03:11:58,211
考倒我了，去问劳伦斯吧
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1569
03:11:58,524 --> 03:12:00,505
-我问过了 -他怎么说？
- I did. - What did he say?

1570
03:12:00,714 --> 03:12:02,278
他大笑
He laughed.

1571
03:12:02,904 --> 03:12:05,406
他要我把哈利斯人叫来
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1572
03:12:06,032 --> 03:12:07,492
他还付我钱
He offered me money.

1573
03:12:07,909 --> 03:12:09,369
你拿了吗？
Did you take it?

1574
03:12:10,203 --> 03:12:12,810
没有，但很多人拿了
No. But many did.

1575
03:12:50,557 --> 03:12:53,581
-这是什么？ -这是我的保镖
- What is this? - This is my bodyguard.

1576
03:12:54,311 --> 03:12:56,918
这里每个人的人头都是有价格的
There is not a man without a price on his head.

1577
03:12:57,127 --> 03:13:00,776
-我的人头也有价格 -但他们是杀手
- There's a price on my head too. - But these are murderers.

1578
03:13:01,089 --> 03:13:02,966
酋长会吊死这些人的
The sheiks will hang these men.

1579
03:13:03,279 --> 03:13:04,947
他们是我的人
These men are mine.

1580
03:13:05,573 --> 03:13:09,744
劳伦斯，他们不了解阿拉伯叛乱
Lawrence, these things know nothing of the Arab revolt.

1581
03:13:10,265 --> 03:13:13,707
-你，艾拉波的盖坦 -长官？
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo. - Sherif?

1582
03:13:14,019 --> 03:13:16,835
-我们要往哪里去啊？ -大马士革，长官
- Where do we ride? - Damascus, sherif.

1583
03:13:17,148 --> 03:13:19,025
对，但为什么？
Aye, but for what?

1584
03:13:19,233 --> 03:13:21,423
沙利夫，为了劳伦斯
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1585
03:13:24,447 --> 03:13:27,784
-你买下了这些东西 -我买下这里一半的人，阿里
- You have bought these things. - I bought half the men here, Ali.

1586
03:13:28,097 --> 03:13:30,808
那不一样，他们不是普通人
That is different. These are not ordinary men.

1587
03:13:31,121 --> 03:13:33,936
我不要普通人，走吧！
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1588
03:13:38,107 --> 03:13:39,880
大马士革！
Damascus!

1589
03:13:40,192 --> 03:13:42,174
大马士革！…
Damascus! Damascus!

1590
03:13:42,487 --> 03:13:45,511
大马士革！…
Damascus! Damascus!

1591
03:14:19,504 --> 03:14:22,945
各位，骑兵队通过□兹瑞尔跟迪拉了
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1592
03:14:23,258 --> 03:14:27,116
这真的是非常好，轮到你们了
Very good, by the way. Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1593
03:14:27,116 --> 03:14:30,870
如果敌人撤退 我们知道他们会撤退的…
If the enemy's retreating in any order, which we'll assume--

1594
03:14:30,870 --> 03:14:32,122
当然
Certainly.

1595
03:14:32,122 --> 03:14:33,790
他不会离麦拉德太远
He can't be far from Mallud...

1596
03:14:34,624 --> 03:14:38,587
所以我应该 在明天九点前能看到他
in which case I can have him within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1597
03:14:39,108 --> 03:14:41,089
太棒了，菲立普
Splendid. Philip.

1598
03:14:41,506 --> 03:14:44,113
这是现阶段最后的步兵支援部队
These are the last infantry supports going up now.

1599
03:14:44,530 --> 03:14:47,867
但星期三燧发枪团会到麦拉德
But Mallud, we could have the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1600
03:14:48,701 --> 03:14:52,247
现在那样就够了，重要的是枪
That'll do for now. The guns are what matter.

1601
03:14:52,247 --> 03:14:53,498
有问题吗？
Any questions?

1602
03:14:54,124 --> 03:14:58,086
这只阿拉伯军队在右边 它是什么组成的？
This Arab army on the right, sir, what's it consist of?

1603
03:14:58,712 --> 03:15:00,797
非正式的骑兵队 大约有两千人
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1604
03:15:01,110 --> 03:15:02,883
他们现在在哪里？
Where are they now?

1605
03:15:03,717 --> 03:15:08,514
-跟他们在一起的人才知道 -那么去找他们，我要知道
- Can only know by being with them. - Then get with them. I want to know.

1606
03:15:08,931 --> 03:15:11,121
痛击他们，查利
Pound them, Charley.

1607
03:15:11,746 --> 03:15:13,102
痛击他们
Pound them.

1608
03:15:23,842 --> 03:15:26,449
愿主保佑躺在那下面的人
God help the men who lie under that.

1609
03:15:26,762 --> 03:15:28,639
他们是土耳其人
They're Turks.

1610
03:15:28,639 --> 03:15:30,203
愿主保佑他们
God help them.

1611
03:16:12,956 --> 03:16:16,710
他简直是失去控制
Well, he's got the bit between his teeth all right.

1612
03:16:17,023 --> 03:16:18,170
他很傲慢吗？
Cocky?

1613
03:16:18,482 --> 03:16:20,151
不光只是傲慢而已
More than cocky, sir.

1614
03:16:20,568 --> 03:16:23,800
他简直是失去控制
He's got the bit between his teeth all right.

1615
03:16:24,113 --> 03:16:27,450
我告诉你 我想他会比我们早到大马士革
I tell you, sir, I think he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1616
03:16:28,284 --> 03:16:30,265
-除非… -除非？
- Unless... - Unless?

1617
03:16:30,265 --> 03:16:34,124
在□兹瑞尔外 有一队土耳其人挡在他前面
Well, there's a Turkish column in front of him, out of Mazril.

1618
03:16:34,541 --> 03:16:37,356
-□兹瑞尔有多少土耳其军队？ -有一旅
- What do the Turks have in Mazril? - A brigade, sir.

1619
03:16:40,380 --> 03:16:42,570
不知道他们现在在哪里
I wonder where they are now.

1620
03:18:24,760 --> 03:18:25,803
不准有囚犯
No prisoners.

1621
03:18:29,452 --> 03:18:31,433
大马士革，劳伦斯
Damascus, Lawrence.

1622
03:18:41,444 --> 03:18:44,259
劳伦斯，别这样
Lawrence, not this.

1623
03:18:44,885 --> 03:18:48,952
来吧，大马士革，劳伦斯
Go round. Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1624
03:18:49,682 --> 03:18:51,246
通通杀光
No prisoners.

1625
03:19:01,465 --> 03:19:02,925
这以前是塔拉尔人的村落
This was Talaal's village.

1626
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:09,181
塔拉尔人！
Talaal!

1627
03:19:19,296 --> 03:19:20,443
塔拉尔人！
Talaal!

1628
03:19:29,515 --> 03:19:31,496
通通杀光！
No prisoners!

1629
03:19:32,017 --> 03:19:33,060
通通杀光！
No prisoners!

1630
03:19:45,052 --> 03:19:46,199
天啊
God.

1631
03:19:50,161 --> 03:19:51,308
天啊
God.

1632
03:19:53,289 --> 03:19:54,645
天啊！
God!

1633
03:22:12,080 --> 03:22:15,104
够了，叫他们住手！
Enough. Enough! Make them stop!

1634
03:23:52,601 --> 03:23:53,748
少校！
Major!

1635
03:23:54,478 --> 03:23:56,042
劳伦斯少校！
Major Lawrence!

1636
03:24:01,777 --> 03:24:03,342
老天爷啊
Jesus wept.

1637
03:24:19,087 --> 03:24:20,234
老天爷啊
Jesus wept.

1638
03:24:22,215 --> 03:24:24,197
那令你惊讶吗？班特利先生
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1639
03:24:24,822 --> 03:24:27,533
你知道阿拉伯人是一只野蛮民族
Surely you know the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1640
03:24:27,846 --> 03:24:29,723
野蛮又残忍
Barbarous and cruel.

1641
03:24:30,453 --> 03:24:32,226
除了他们还会是谁？
Who but they?

1642
03:24:32,747 --> 03:24:34,103
除了他们还会是谁？
Who but they?

1643
03:24:36,501 --> 03:24:38,795
你这个混蛋
Oh, you rotten man.

1644
03:24:39,838 --> 03:24:44,322
来吧，我帮你这个混蛋拍张照
Here, let me take your rotten bloody picture.

1645
03:24:46,512 --> 03:24:48,493
给那个该死的报纸
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1646
03:25:14,979 --> 03:25:18,524
这是昨晚在大马士革割下来的 劳伦斯
These were cut last night, Lawrence, in Damascus.

1647
03:25:18,941 --> 03:25:20,610
大马士革！
Damascus!

1648
03:25:20,922 --> 03:25:22,695
把它们拿去给阿里长官
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1649
03:25:23,008 --> 03:25:24,259
告诉他
Tell him.

1650
03:25:25,406 --> 03:25:26,970
提醒他
Remind him.

1651
03:25:28,013 --> 03:25:30,933
-艾伦比在大马士革吗？ -他在附近
- Is Allenby in Damascus? - Near.

1652
03:25:31,871 --> 03:25:34,061
告诉阿里长官
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1653
03:25:35,521 --> 03:25:37,189
他们还没熟呢
They are not ripe.

1654
03:25:40,735 --> 03:25:42,925
(大马士革)

1655
03:25:43,133 --> 03:25:45,219
将军万岁！
General salute!

1656
03:25:45,531 --> 03:25:47,617
举枪！
Present arms!

1657
03:26:02,111 --> 03:26:03,884
枪放下！
Port arms!

1658
03:26:06,804 --> 03:26:08,576
劳伦斯在背后搞鬼，长官
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1659
03:26:08,889 --> 03:26:11,704
全镇贴满了阿拉伯旗帜
The whole town is plastered with the Arab flag.

1660
03:26:17,961 --> 03:26:19,734
-那是什么时候的事？ -已经一天一夜，长官
- When? - A day and a night, sir.

1661
03:26:19,942 --> 03:26:21,923
他们来这里一天一夜了
They've been here a day and a night.

1662
03:26:22,236 --> 03:26:24,635
他们占据了这个小镇 他们做到了
They've occupied the town. They've done it.

1663
03:26:24,947 --> 03:26:28,806
他将总部设在镇公所
He's set up his own headquarters in the town hall.

1664
03:26:29,744 --> 03:26:31,517
除了镇公所外还占了什么？
What else beside the town hall?

1665
03:26:31,830 --> 03:26:34,541
电信局，邮局，发电厂…
Telephone exchange, post office, powerhouse...

1666
03:26:34,958 --> 03:26:37,252
医院，火车站 什么都占了，长官
hospitals, fire station. Everything, sir.

1667
03:26:37,565 --> 03:26:40,380
他们自称是阿拉伯国家议会
They call themselves the Arab National Council...

1668
03:26:40,693 --> 03:26:42,257
他们在镇公所里
and they're in the town hall.

1669
03:26:42,570 --> 03:26:45,385
他们是你的问题了，哈利
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1670
03:26:47,158 --> 03:26:48,618
我们该怎么办？
What should we do?

1671
03:26:48,931 --> 03:26:51,225
尽快把他们弄出那里
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1672
03:26:52,163 --> 03:26:54,040
你觉得呢？戴丹
How about that, Dryden?

1673
03:26:55,813 --> 03:26:58,524
除非你想引起全面的抗争
Not unless you want a full-scale rising.

1674
03:26:59,254 --> 03:27:02,278
-那么要怎么做呢？ -费萨尔何时会到大马士革？
- What, then? - When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1675
03:27:02,591 --> 03:27:04,468
他搭专用的火车，两天内会到
By special train in two days' time.

1676
03:27:04,885 --> 03:27:06,345
两天
Two days.

1677
03:27:06,345 --> 03:27:09,682
最多两天，超过了 我无法再拖住他
Two days is what you asked for. I can't keep him out any longer.

1678
03:27:09,994 --> 03:27:12,184
-那不够吗？ -够了
- Isn't it enough? - Yes.

1679
03:27:12,184 --> 03:27:15,625
-我想够了 -我们不能什么都不做
- Ample, I should think. - We can't just do nothing.

1680
03:27:15,938 --> 03:27:19,483
为什么？通常那是最好的方法 拿点东西来给我们喝，崔西
Why not? It's usually best. Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1681
03:27:19,796 --> 03:27:23,759
崔西，没有进一步的命令 军队们都扎营不准离开
And Tracey, all troops to remain quartered until further orders.

1682
03:27:24,384 --> 03:27:25,948
技术单位也一样吗？
Does that apply to technical units?

1683
03:27:26,261 --> 03:27:28,347
特别是技术单位
Technical units particularly.

1684
03:27:28,660 --> 03:27:30,015
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1685
03:27:30,641 --> 03:27:31,996
医药单位也一样吗？长官
Medicals too, sir?

1686
03:27:32,309 --> 03:27:34,395
恐怕是的，哈利
I'm af raid so, Harry.

1687
03:27:34,916 --> 03:27:36,480
医药单位也一样
Medicals too.

1688
03:28:16,939 --> 03:28:18,399
这里的人…
We here...

1689
03:28:18,712 --> 03:28:21,527
不是哈利斯人或哈威塔特人
are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1690
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:24,864
也不是其他部族的人
nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1691
03:28:25,177 --> 03:28:28,618
我们是费萨尔王子 领导的阿拉伯议会的阿拉伯人
of the Arab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.

1692
03:28:29,035 --> 03:28:30,912
他侮辱我
He insulted me.

1693
03:28:32,059 --> 03:28:36,126
阿里长官说 电话现在属于哈威塔特人
Sherif Ali said that the telephones are in the care of the Howeitat...

1694
03:28:36,543 --> 03:28:39,254
它们现在都不通，这是真的
and they have ceased to work. And this is true.

1695
03:28:39,775 --> 03:28:43,425
电话不通是因为没电
They will not work because they are given no electricity.

1696
03:28:43,842 --> 03:28:47,179
电属于哈利斯人
The electricity is in the care of the Harith.

1697
03:28:49,786 --> 03:28:51,976
你一答话，就会血流成河
If you answer, there will be bloodshed.

1698
03:28:53,018 --> 03:28:56,459
你要跟我谈血流成河？
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1699
03:28:59,171 --> 03:29:03,029
我请求奥达阿布塔耶的原谅
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1700
03:29:03,446 --> 03:29:05,114
诚心的求吗？
Humbly?

1701
03:29:05,114 --> 03:29:06,366
诚心的求吗？哈利斯
Humbly, Harith?

1702
03:29:06,783 --> 03:29:08,764
是的，诚心的求
Yes, humbly.

1703
03:29:09,077 --> 03:29:11,267
这倒是新把戏
This is a new trick.

1704
03:29:12,309 --> 03:29:13,873
为什么没电？
Why is there no electricity?

1705
03:29:14,916 --> 03:29:17,627
我去过发电厂了，劳伦斯
I have been to that electrical house, Lawrence.

1706
03:29:17,940 --> 03:29:20,756
那里有三部大机器
There are three large machines.

1707
03:29:21,068 --> 03:29:23,362
他是说发电机！
He means generators!

1708
03:29:23,884 --> 03:29:25,031
所以呢？
So.

1709
03:29:25,552 --> 03:29:27,116
有一部在燃烧
One of them is burning.

1710
03:29:27,429 --> 03:29:30,557
所有机器都是这样
They are of an incredible size, but helpless.

1711
03:29:30,870 --> 03:29:33,477
所有机器都是这样
It is so of all machines.

1712
03:29:33,790 --> 03:29:37,752
由它们烧吧，电话有什么作用？
Let them burn. What need of telephones?

1713
03:29:40,568 --> 03:29:43,488
-当然有用 -那么我们需要英国工程师
- The need is absolute. - Then we need English engineers.

1714
03:29:43,905 --> 03:29:47,554
不，把英国工程师带进来 英国政府也会跟着来
No. Take English engineers and you take English government.

1715
03:29:47,867 --> 03:29:48,910
带…
Take--

1716
03:29:53,185 --> 03:29:54,332
失火了
Fire has broken out.

1717
03:29:54,645 --> 03:29:56,105
-在哪里？ -金西比区
- Where? - The Jinsibi district.

1718
03:29:56,418 --> 03:29:59,233
-在那一区不重要 -火势会扩散的！
- It is not a district that matters. - It will spread!

1719
03:29:59,546 --> 03:30:01,214
那么叫消防队啊！
Then use the fire brigade!

1720
03:30:01,527 --> 03:30:04,343
我们试过了，但水不够强
We have tried, but there is no force in the water.

1721
03:30:04,655 --> 03:30:06,011
那你们得去提水
Then you must carry it.

1722
03:30:06,324 --> 03:30:10,495
-鲁阿拉人不提水的 -他们会做什么事？
- The Ruala do not carry water. - What else are they good for?

1723
03:30:23,008 --> 03:30:26,553
我们今天下午才接受陈情
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1724
03:30:29,473 --> 03:30:31,141
今天下午！
This afternoon!

1725
03:30:54,916 --> 03:30:58,879
-战后我要面对这些事 -我们真的该想个办法啊
- I'll take this up after the war. - Surely we should do something, sir.

1726
03:30:59,087 --> 03:31:03,050
-这是老人的运动了 -你是老人吗？
- It's an old man's sport. - Are you an old man, sir?

1727
03:31:03,362 --> 03:31:06,178
我只能说责任真的很重大
All I can say is, sir, it's a heavy responsibility.

1728
03:31:07,638 --> 03:31:08,889
对不起
Sorry, sir.

1729
03:31:11,183 --> 03:31:12,852
或许是灯泡的问题
Maybe it's the bulb.

1730
03:31:17,544 --> 03:31:18,587
不是的
No, sir.

1731
03:31:19,108 --> 03:31:20,776
是电力的问题
It's the power.

1732
03:31:36,001 --> 03:31:37,356
他们要离开了
They're leaving.

1733
03:31:38,086 --> 03:31:39,755
那么就这样了
That's it, then.

1734
03:31:40,380 --> 03:31:42,361
他们这些乞丐长得不错，对吧？
Marvellous-Iooking beggars, aren't they?

1735
03:32:03,634 --> 03:32:06,449
算了吧，劳伦斯，跟我来
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1736
03:32:06,762 --> 03:32:08,639
-去哪里？ -回去
- Come where? - Back.

1737
03:32:13,227 --> 03:32:15,312
我了解你的心
I know your heart.

1738
03:32:23,863 --> 03:32:25,427
那是什么？
What is it?

1739
03:32:26,574 --> 03:32:28,034
是这个吗？
Is it this?

1740
03:32:30,954 --> 03:32:33,978
我说过了，这没什么
I tell you, this is nothing.

1741
03:32:47,221 --> 03:32:48,889
那是血吗？
Is it the blood?

1742
03:32:49,619 --> 03:32:52,747
在沙漠里流干的血 比你想像中还多
The desert has dried up more blood than you could think of.

1743
03:32:54,207 --> 03:32:58,378
我祈祷再也不必去沙漠
I pray that I may never see the desert again.

1744
03:32:59,734 --> 03:33:00,985
听我说，上帝
Hear me, God.

1745
03:33:02,758 --> 03:33:06,512
你会来的 沙漠是你唯一栖身之处
You will come. There is only the desert for you.

1746
03:33:23,404 --> 03:33:24,655
你呢？
What about you?

1747
03:33:25,803 --> 03:33:29,244
不，我要待在这里学习政治
No, I shall stay here and learn politics.

1748
03:33:31,850 --> 03:33:33,206
一种很低等的职业
A very low occupation.

1749
03:33:33,727 --> 03:33:36,751
我在遇见你时 根本没想过要这样
I had not thought of it when I met you.

1750
03:33:45,719 --> 03:33:48,847
你非常努力地 将大马士革交给我们
You have tried very hard to give us Damascus.

1751
03:33:48,847 --> 03:33:50,724
那是我来这里的原因
It's what I came for.

1752
03:33:54,270 --> 03:33:55,417
那么…
And then...

1753
03:33:57,919 --> 03:33:59,275
那是件伟大的事
it would be something.

1754
03:33:59,588 --> 03:34:00,630
对
Yes.

1755
03:34:01,465 --> 03:34:02,507
很伟大
Much.

1756
03:34:21,798 --> 03:34:24,092
-他是你的朋友吗？ -把你的手拿开
- He is your friend? - Take your hand away.

1757
03:34:24,405 --> 03:34:25,552
-你爱他 -我怕他
- You love him. - I fear him.

1758
03:34:25,865 --> 03:34:27,638
那你为什么哭？
Then why do you weep?

1759
03:34:28,055 --> 03:34:30,349
如果我怕他，也那么爱他…
If I fear him, who love him...

1760
03:34:30,349 --> 03:34:33,269
就知道他有多怕自己 多么的痛恨自己的了？
how must he fear himself, who hates himself?

1761
03:34:33,686 --> 03:34:36,814
把你的手拿开，哈威塔特人！
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1762
03:34:39,212 --> 03:34:42,653
原来你还不是一个完全的政客
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1763
03:34:42,653 --> 03:34:43,696
还不是
Not yet.

1764
03:34:44,113 --> 03:34:48,076
现在有很多新把戏 而我是一只老狗了
Well, these are new tricks, and I am an old dog.

1765
03:34:49,014 --> 03:34:50,787
谢谢阿拉
And Allah be thanked.

1766
03:34:51,413 --> 03:34:52,664
我会告诉你…
I'll tell thee what...

1767
03:34:53,081 --> 03:34:56,313
当一个阿拉伯人 比你想像中还难，哈利斯
being an Arab will be thornier than you suppose, Harith.

1768
03:35:17,898 --> 03:35:21,027
我一生没看过这种事
In all my years, I've never seen anything like it.

1769
03:35:21,444 --> 03:35:24,155
这是阿拉伯议会的管辖范围？
It comes within the jurisdiction of the Arab Council.

1770
03:35:24,468 --> 03:35:28,639
在这种情况下 我想我该立刻接手
Under the circumstances, I think I must take over. Immediately.

1771
03:35:29,056 --> 03:35:32,080
毕竟在任何一种情况下 你都该服从命令
Under any circumstances at all, you must obey your orders.

1772
03:35:32,393 --> 03:35:33,853
不，长官，我不会的
No, sir, I will not.

1773
03:35:34,895 --> 03:35:36,459
控制一下你自己
Control yourself.

1774
03:35:36,981 --> 03:35:40,109
到镇公所那边 去看看他们说了什么
Now, go over to the town hall and see what they say.

1775
03:35:41,048 --> 03:35:43,237
市立医院那边已经尽力了
We did what we could in the civic hospitals.

1776
03:35:43,550 --> 03:35:46,261
但你忘了土耳其军事医院
But you forgot the Turkish Military Hospital.

1777
03:35:46,783 --> 03:35:50,954
那里有六百个床位 有约两千名的土耳其伤患
It has 600 beds. There are about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1778
03:35:51,892 --> 03:35:56,480
他们都是你宝贝的阿拉伯议会的责任
All of whom are the responsibility of your precious Arab Council.

1779
03:36:03,258 --> 03:36:04,718
情形是如何呢？
What's it like?

1780
03:37:21,465 --> 03:37:23,446
这太过份了！
This is outrageous!

1781
03:37:24,697 --> 03:37:26,574
太过份了！
Outrageous!

1782
03:37:29,911 --> 03:37:31,475
太过份了！
Outrageous!

1783
03:37:32,726 --> 03:37:34,812
你这个王八蛋！
You filthy little wog!

1784
03:37:45,344 --> 03:37:49,410
“我的朋友劳伦斯” 如果我可以这么叫他的话
My friend Lawrence, if I may call him that.

1785
03:37:49,828 --> 03:37:52,434
“我的朋友劳伦斯”
" My friend Lawrence."

1786
03:37:52,434 --> 03:37:57,023
多少人会宣称 他们有权那么说呢？太光荣了
How many men will claim the right to use that phrase? How proudly.

1787
03:37:57,335 --> 03:37:59,838
他期盼着祖国的绿地
He longs for the greenness of his native land.

1788
03:38:00,151 --> 03:38:05,156
他渴望在苏利的葛德式房屋，对吧？
He pines for the Gothic cottages of Surrey, is it not?

1789
03:38:05,469 --> 03:38:09,118
他已经在想像他钓着鳟鱼
Already in imagination, he catches trout...

1790
03:38:09,431 --> 03:38:12,768
从事英国绅士的所有活动
and all the activities of the English gentleman.

1791
03:38:13,185 --> 03:38:16,522
你说的人是我 不是劳伦斯上校
That's me you're describing, sir, not Colonel Lawrence.

1792
03:38:17,565 --> 03:38:19,650
你升上上校了
You're promoted colonel.

1793
03:38:19,963 --> 03:38:22,570
是，为什么？
Yes. What for?

1794
03:38:22,570 --> 03:38:26,011
接受这荣誉吧，上校 表现出一点热忱来
Take the honour, colonel. Be a little kind.

1795
03:38:26,011 --> 03:38:29,974
身为上校，在船坞那边 你会有栋小木屋
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin to yourself on the boat home.

1796
03:38:30,808 --> 03:38:32,997
谢谢你
Then, thank you.

1797
03:38:37,273 --> 03:38:38,420
那么…
Well, then...

1798
03:38:39,150 --> 03:38:40,088
愿上帝保佑你
Godspeed.

1799
03:38:40,714 --> 03:38:44,468
这里不需要战士了
There's nothing further here for a warrior.

1800
03:38:44,885 --> 03:38:48,952
我们在讨价还价 那是老头子的工作
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1801
03:38:49,160 --> 03:38:51,663
年青人制造战争 战争的本质…
Young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men.

1802
03:38:51,663 --> 03:38:53,540
就是年轻人的本质

1803
03:38:53,853 --> 03:38:57,189
未来的勇气跟希望
Courage and hope for the future.

1804
03:38:57,502 --> 03:39:00,109
老人则维持和平
Then old men make the peace.

1805
03:39:01,256 --> 03:39:04,072
和平的罪行是老人的罪行
And the vices of peace are the vices of old men.

1806
03:39:04,384 --> 03:39:06,783
不信任跟戒心
Mistrust and caution.

1807
03:39:07,825 --> 03:39:09,598
一定是这样的
It must be so.

1808
03:39:26,074 --> 03:39:30,557
我欠你的东西多到数不清
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1809
03:39:40,359 --> 03:39:44,009
发电厂，电信局，这些我都认输
The powerhouse, the telephone exchange, these I concede.

1810
03:39:44,322 --> 03:39:45,990
我得留住水厂
The pumping plant I must retain.

1811
03:39:46,303 --> 03:39:48,806
如果你留住了它 那么就无水可用了
If you retain it, there will be no water.

1812
03:39:49,118 --> 03:39:52,664
-我很希望你们能够帮忙 -那么你得扯下你的旗帜
- I shall be glad of assistance. - Then you must bring down your flag.

1813
03:39:53,081 --> 03:39:56,939
我不会的，若你手下要那么做 我的手下会反抗的
I shall not, and if your men attempt it, my men will resist it.

1814
03:39:57,252 --> 03:39:58,816
-你有手下吗？ -我的手下够打败你了
- Have you men? - Enough of that.

1815
03:39:59,129 --> 03:40:01,423
这件事可以造成了可怕的事件
It's a thing that makes an ugly incident.

1816
03:40:01,840 --> 03:40:03,613
我相信你的政府…
I'm sure your government...

1817
03:40:03,926 --> 03:40:07,679
不希望在和平会议上 以侵略者的身份出现
does not wish to appear at the peace conference as an aggressor.

1818
03:40:09,974 --> 03:40:11,538
喂！
I say!

1819
03:40:12,893 --> 03:40:14,770
是劳伦斯，对吧？
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1820
03:40:17,169 --> 03:40:19,463
我能跟您握个手吗？
May I shake your hand, sir?

1821
03:40:20,610 --> 03:40:23,112
我只是想跟别人吹嘘一下而已
Just want to be able to say I'd done it, sir.

1822
03:40:26,866 --> 03:40:29,056
我们以前不认识吧？
Haven't we met before?

1823
03:40:29,264 --> 03:40:30,829
我想是不认识
Don't think so, sir.

1824
03:40:31,141 --> 03:40:33,853
对，不然我会记得的
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1825
03:40:39,066 --> 03:40:43,029
大家都知道阿拉伯议会 是因我之名而得到权力
It is widely known the Arab Council took power in my name.

1826
03:40:43,446 --> 03:40:45,427
他们没有权力，那是错觉
They have no power. It's illusory.

1827
03:40:45,740 --> 03:40:48,138
错觉有时会很有力的
Illusions can be very powerf ul.

1828
03:40:48,555 --> 03:40:50,015
特别是…
Particularly...

1829
03:40:51,058 --> 03:40:53,665
当它们采取这样的模式
when they take this form.

1830
03:40:55,855 --> 03:40:58,670
全世界都很喜欢…
The world is delighted at the picture of Damascus...

1831
03:40:58,983 --> 03:41:00,964
被阿拉伯军队 解放大马士革的照片
liberated by the Arab army.

1832
03:41:01,486 --> 03:41:04,509
我得提醒你，那次行动 是由一位英国军官所领导
Led, may I remind you, by a British-serving officer.

1833
03:41:05,135 --> 03:41:10,140
对，劳伦斯 像是一把刀的两面利刃
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence is a sword with two edges.

1834
03:41:10,453 --> 03:41:13,373
我们都很高兴除掉他了，对吧？
We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?

1835
03:41:17,127 --> 03:41:19,212
我还以为我是个狠心人
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1836
03:41:20,151 --> 03:41:22,445
你只是一个将军
You are merely a general.

1837
03:41:25,052 --> 03:41:26,512
我该当个国王的
I must be a king.

1838
03:41:29,536 --> 03:41:31,308
对不起
Excuse me, sir.

1839
03:41:46,011 --> 03:41:47,262
什么？
Well?

1840
03:41:48,097 --> 03:41:49,556
那个…
Well...

1841
03:41:50,078 --> 03:41:52,789
看来我们将会有一个 插上了阿拉伯旗帜的…
it seems we're to have a British waterworks...

1842
03:41:53,102 --> 03:41:55,292
英国水利局
with an Arab flag on it.

1843
03:41:55,604 --> 03:41:57,481
你觉得值得吗？
Do you think it was worth it?

1844
03:41:57,690 --> 03:42:00,297
那不关我的事 谢天谢地，我是个士兵
Not my business. Thank God I'm a soldier.

1845
03:42:00,714 --> 03:42:01,861
是的
Yes, sir.

1846
03:42:02,278 --> 03:42:03,738
你一直都是那么说
So you keep saying.

1847
03:42:04,051 --> 03:42:05,511
我猜…
You, I suspect...

1848
03:42:06,136 --> 03:42:09,890
你是这个大和解的主要推手
are chief architect of this compromise.

1849
03:42:10,411 --> 03:42:13,540
-你觉得呢？ -我吗？殿下
- What do you think? - Me, Your Highness?

1850
03:42:14,270 --> 03:42:18,232
总体来说 我后悔离开唐布利吉水井区
On the whole, I wish I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1851
03:42:56,501 --> 03:42:59,525
回家去吧
Well, sir. Going home.

1852
03:43:01,923 --> 03:43:03,488
回家去吧
Home, sir.

1853
03:43:10,683 --> 03:43:14,455
再见，多丽，我得离开你
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you

1854
03:43:14,541 --> 03:43:17,669
虽然离去会让我心伤
Though it breaks my heart to go
