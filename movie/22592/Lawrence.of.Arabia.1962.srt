1
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,805
他是我认识的人当中 最不平凡的一个人
He was the most extraordinary man I ever knew.

2
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,162
你跟他很熟吗？
Did you know him well?

3
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,005
我认识他
I knew him.

4
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,068
WeIl, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,283
但他真的值得…
But did he really deserve...

6
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,801
你们把他葬在这里吗？
...a place in here?

7
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,604
艾伦比大人 你能谈谈劳伦斯吗？
Lord Allenby, could you give a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,842
什么？还要再说啊？
What, more words?

9
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,523
沙漠的叛乱事件…
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,406
在中东局势中 扮演着决定性的角色
...played a decisive part in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,411
是的，但我想请您 谈谈劳伦斯上校这个人
Yes, sir, but about Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,046
不，我跟他不熟，你知道的
No, no. I didn't know him well, you know.

13
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,243
班特尼先生，你可说是最认识劳伦斯
Mr. Bentley, you know as much about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,205
是的，能认识他…
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,091
跟让世人认识他，是我的荣幸
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,729
他是诗人，学者及英勇的战士
He was a poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,041
谢谢
Thank you.

18
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,922
他还是自从巴纳姆跟贝利之后 最无耻的爱现狂
He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,044
您是哪位？
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,567
我是杰克森班特尼
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,931
我听到你刚说的话 并对那提出最严重的异议
I overheard your last remark and take the gravest exception.

22
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,447
-他是个伟大的人 -你认识他吗？
-He was a great man. -Did you know him?

23
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,722
不，我不能说我认识他
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,406
我很荣幸在大马士革跟他握过手
I had the honour to shake his hand in Damascus.

25
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,290
认识他？我从来都不认识他
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,962
他曾在开罗为我做些不重要工作
He had some minor function on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,330
麦克乔治哈特利
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,888
这是个又脏又暗的小房间
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,127
没错
That's right.

30
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,602
我们在这里不快乐
We are not happy in it.

31
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,691
我快乐，这要比待在 又脏又暗的的小战壕来得好
I am. It's better than a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,322
-那么你是个高尚的贵族罗 -没错
-Then you're a big noble fellow. -That's right.

33
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,526
威廉波特拿着我的报纸来了
Here is William Potter with my newspaper.

34
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,281
-拿去吧 -谢谢
-Here you are, tosh. -Thanks.

35
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,449
你想来根哈特利上校的香烟吗？
Would you care for one of Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,287
-有刊登吗？ -当然有
-Is it there? -Of course.

37
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,130
头条新闻
Headlines.

38
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,849
我敢说泰晤士时报 一定没提这条新闻
But I bet it isn't mentioned in the Times.

39
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,849
“贝都因人攻击土耳其要塞”
"Bedouin tribes attack Turkish stronghold."

40
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,486
我敢说连这里总部的人 都不知道这件事
I bet that no one in this headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,441
或者在乎这件事，我来帮你点烟
Or would care if it did. Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,008
-劳伦斯先生？ -我就是
-Mr. Lawrence? -Yes.

43
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,487
-您的电报 -谢谢
-Flimsy, sir. -Thank you.

44
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,848
你总有一次会闯祸的 只不过是血肉罢了
You'll do that once too often. It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,845
麦克乔治哈特利 你是个哲学家
Michael George Hartley, you're a philosopher.

46
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,963
你是个怪人！
And you're balmy!

47
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,010
-好痛啊！ -当然会痛罗
-It damn well hurts! -Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,124
那么秘诀是什么？
What's the trick, then?

49
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,410
威廉波特 秘诀就是不要在乎会痛
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,604
还有如果吉普森上尉要找我
By the way, if Captain Gibbon should enquire for me...

51
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,208
告诉他我去跟将军聊天了
...tell him I've gone for a chat with the general.

52
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,127
-他是个怪人 -他很正常
-He's balmy. -He's all right.

53
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,565
劳伦斯
Lawrence.

54
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,566
什么事？
Yes?

55
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,609
你应该要…
You're supposed to be....

56
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,401
你通常都是那样戴着 帽子进来这里的吗？
Do you usually wear your cap in the mess?

57
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,287
我一直都是这样
Always.

58
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,722
你应该在当班 你要去哪里？
You should be on duty. Where are you going?

59
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,401
别跟我说教 佛莱迪，这里是休息室啊
Mustn't talk shop, Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,568
我要去跟将军谈一谈
I'm going for a powwow with the general.

61
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,287
我不是以长官的身份问你 而是以休息室负责人身份在问你
I'm not asking as your superior, but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,927
我们不要该在当班的人进来
We don't want chaps in here who should be on duty.

63
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,651
请告诉我，你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

64
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,403
我得警告你，劳伦斯！
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,444
-抱歉 -你是个小丑，劳伦斯
-Sorry. -You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,088
不可能人人都是驯兽师
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,761
抱歉
Sorry.

68
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,602
真是个谜，戴登
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,048
我不建议让一个自大愚蠢的中尉
I do not propose to let an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,767
对指挥官的命令不屑一顾 而且还不受到惩罚
...thumb his nose at his commander and get away with it.

71
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,283
听起来没有他不是任何大损失
It doesn't sound as though he'd be any great loss, sir.

72
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,923
别那么做，戴登，这是原则问题
Don't try that, Dryden. There's a principle involved.

73
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,645
没错
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,809
他待在开罗一点用处都没有
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,169
他或许该到阿拉伯去 他清楚时事，长官
He might be in Arabia. He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,930
你是说他清楚那本书吧
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,283
我已经派布莱顿上校去了 他是一位士兵
I've already sent out Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,284
如果布莱顿认为我们该出兵 我们会那么做的
If Brighton thinks we should send some arms, we will.

79
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,130
你还需要什么？
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,449
你确定劳伦斯中尉…
That there would be no question of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,648
不会给任何军事上的建议
...giving military advice.

82
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,808
天啊，我希望他不会那么做
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,562
只是阿拉伯局 希望有自己的人在现场…
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like its own man on the spot to....

84
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,801
做什么？
To what?

85
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,526
给我们作一个评估
To make our own appraisal of the situation.

86
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,805
我还要告诉你 这是我跟我手下的意见
I'll tell you, it's my considered opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,845
任何花在贝都因人身上的时间 都是浪费了的时间
...that time spent on the Bedouin will be time wasted.

88
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,481
他们是一个偷羊贼的民族
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,604
他们的确攻击了麦地纳
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,167
土耳其人把他们打的粉身碎骨
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.

91
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,731
我们不知道这件事
We don't know that.

92
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,484
我们知道他们没接受 那没什么，只是段小插曲
We know that they didn't take it. A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,165
如果你想听我的意见 我觉得这儿根本是个小插曲
In my opinion, this whole theatre of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,763
真正的战争敌人是德国人 不是土耳其人
The real war's being fought against Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,844
战场不在这里而是在西线
Not here, but on the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,520
你的贝都因军队 不管他们是如何称呼自己
Your Bedouin Army, or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,331
他们只不过是一段小插曲中的小配角
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,166
伟大的事都是 从很小的开端开始的，长官
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,643
阿拉伯局希望阿拉伯发生大事吗？
Does the Arab Bureau want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,368
在战争结束后 他们会臣服于我们之下吗？
Does the bureau think they'll sit down under us when this war is over?

101
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,521
长官，局里认为 现在的工作是要打胜仗
The bureau thinks the job of the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,401
别告诉我我有什么责任，戴登先生
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,362
-劳伦斯来了，长官 -请他进来
-Lawrence, sir. -Send him in.

104
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,441
早安
Good morning, sir.

105
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,170
敬礼
Salute.

106
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,727
如果你要抗命，我会逮捕你的
If you're insubordinate, I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,729
-是我的态度 -你的什么？
-It's my manner. -Your what?

108
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,810
长官，我的态度看来像是抗命 但事实上却不然
My manner. It looks insubordinate, but it isn't.

109
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,046
我弄不清楚 你是态度恶劣或是愚蠢
I can't make out whether you're bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,244
-我也有相同的问题，长官 -闭嘴
-I have the same problem, sir. -Shut up.

111
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,882
阿拉伯局认为你在阿拉伯 应该会派上用场了
The Arab Bureau thinks you would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,810
我真想不到什么原因
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,486
你无法完成你现在的任务
You can't perform your present duties properly.

114
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,609
“我不会拉提琴，但我能让一个 小城市变成一个伟大的国家”
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great state from a little city."

115
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,087
-什么？ -那是希米斯特克拉斯的话
-What? -Themistocles, sir.

116
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,921
-他是希腊的哲学家 -我知道你受过高深的教育
-A Greek philosopher. -I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,407
你的档案上是那么说的
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,764
你是我受不了的那种人 劳伦斯
You're the kind of creature I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,201
但我想我可能错了
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,610
好了，戴丹 你可以把他带走六星期
All right, Dryden. You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,242
谁知道呢？或许可以把他 变成男子汉，进来！
Who knows? It might even make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,605
什么事？
Yes, what is it?

123
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,605
舰队明天晚上会到赛德港
The convoy will be in Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,802
-确定了吗？ -是的，长官
-Is that certain? -Yes, sir.

125
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,127
看来似乎没有大跑
There doesn't seem to be any artillery.

126
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,130
但应该要有才对啊！
But there must be artillery!

127
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,367
长官，他要去很远的地方
Sir, this is something of an expedition.

128
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,810
他得到阳波去找向导 找到阿拉伯人然后回来
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide, find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,611
他在六星期内是办不到的
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,965
-那么就两个月吧 -三个月
-Two months, then. -Three.

131
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,570
好吧，三个月，好了 可以让我做点工作了吗？戴丹
All right, three. Now, will you let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

谢谢您，长官
Thank you, sir.

133
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,328
我想说的是我很高兴 您做了这样的决定
I'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful for this.

134
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,409
闭上你的嘴，快滚出去
Shut up and get out.

135
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,845
长官
Sir?

136
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,768
没有该死的大跑 我要怎么打赢一场战争？
How can I fight a bloody war without bloody artillery?

137
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,651
-你是怎么办到？ -你该问我干嘛这么为你费心
-How did you do it? -Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,402
-因为我是最合适的人 -我真不知道
-Because I'm the man for the job. -I just wonder about that.

139
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,524
我当然是罗 对了，任务内容是什么？
Of course I am. What is the job, by the way?

140
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,490
去找费瑟王子
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,609
好，找到他之后呢？
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,847
查出他是什么样的人
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,846
查出他有什么企图 不是立即的企图
Find out what his intentions are. Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,571
那是布莱顿上校的事 不是你的事
That is Colonel Brighton's business, not yours.

145
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,129
我是说他在阿拉伯所有的企图
I mean, his intentions in Arabia altogether.

146
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,885
那可新奇了
That's new.

147
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,851
他们现在在哪里？
Where are they now?

148
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,964
在麦地纳方圆三百里内

149
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,690
他们是哈希米特贝都因人
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,561
他们可以在一天内 在沙漠中行走六十里
They can cross 60 miles of desert in a day.

151
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,848
谢谢你，戴丹，这一定会很有趣
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,241
劳伦斯，沙漠里只有 两种人物可以享乐
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert:

153
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,042
就是贝都因人跟神，你两者都不是 记住我的话
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither. Take it from me.

154
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,562
对普通人来说 那里像是个炙热的火炉
For ordinary men, it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,561
不，戴丹，一定会很好玩的
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,648
大家都认为你的幽默感很有趣
It is recognised that you have a funny sense of fun.

157
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,449
你可以在这里喝点水
Here you may drink.

158
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,451
一杯就好
One cup.

159
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,804
你不喝？
You do not drink?

160
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,487
我不要
No.

161
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,564

-你不是从开罗骑骆驼来的？ -不是
-You did not ride from Cairo? -No.

168

谢天谢地，那可有九百里远啊 我是搭船来的
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles. I came by boat.

一个哈齐尼人在这里做什么？

这口水井就是一切

阿里长官
Sherif Ali.

239
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,129
只要阿拉伯的部族战争不休
So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe...

240
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,840
他们仍是一个弱小的民族
...so long will they be a little people...

241
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,531
一个愚蠢的民族

242
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,204
跟你一样贪婪，野蛮跟残忍

我不要你陪我一起去，长官
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,882
万迪沙法拉离这里 还要一天的路程

You will not find it, and you will die.

248

很棒的军队罗盘
Good army compass.

250
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,483
我把它拿走会怎么样？
How if I take it?

251
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,251
那你就是小偷
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,765
你不怕吗？英国人
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,246
怕不怕是我的问题
My fear is my concern.

254
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,091
真的
Truly.

255
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,128
愿真主与你同在，英国人
God be with you, English.

256
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,209
嘿，你！
Hey, you!

257
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,729

-I've been waiting for you. -Did you know I was coming?

258
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,207
我知道有人会来 费瑟告诉我的
I knew someone was coming. Feisal told me.

259
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,885
他怎么会知道？
How did he know?

260
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,004
方圆五十里发生的事 没有一件是费瑟不知道的
Not much happens within 50 miles of Feisal that he doesn't know.

261
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,248
我相信，没有人陪你来？
I'll give him that. No escort?

262
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,000
我的向导在马斯杜拉水井被杀了
My guide was killed at the Masturah Well.

263
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,084

-Turks? -No, an Arab.

264
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,801
残忍的野蛮人
Bloody savages.

265
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,643
-这里是万迪沙法拉，对吧？ -对，他们在那边
-This is Wadi Safra, isn't it? -Yes, they're over there.

266
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,451
等一下，你叫什么名字？ 是谁派你来的？
Just a minute. What's your name and who sent you?

267
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,725
我是劳伦斯 我隶属于阿拉伯局
Lawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab Bureau.

268
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,767
你在为阿拉伯局做什么？
What are you to do for the Arab Bureau?

269
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,926
不是很清楚 我是来了解这儿的状况
Well, it's rather vague, sir. I'm to appreciate the situation.

270
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,565
那一点都不难，情况非常可怕
Well, that won't be difficult. The situation's bloody awful.

271
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,923
他们的士气 我怀疑他们是否有士气
Their morale, if they ever had any, which I doubt...

272
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,125
土耳其人在麦地纳前 用榴弹跑击溃了他们
...the Turks knocked out of them in front of Medina, with howitzers.

273
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,761
他们每晚都有好几十个跑掉
They're fading away by dozens every night.

274
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,644
这是我想说的：
What I want to say is this:

275
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,571
不管你在哪里 还有你跟谁在一起
Wherever you are and whoever you are with...

276
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,603
你仍是英国军官，这是命令
...you're a British officer. Here's an order.

277
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,600
当我们进入营地时 你得把嘴巴闭上
When we get into that camp, you're to keep your mouth shut.

278
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,765
-你知道我在说什么吗？ -我知道你在说什么
-Do you understand what I'm saying? -I understand what you're saying.

279
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,884
你了解好了以后就回到…
You'll make your appreciation and get back to--

280
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,283
天啊
Oh, my God.

281
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,803
别又来了
Not again.

282
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,849
我告诉过他了 天知道，我告诉过他了
I've told him! God knows I've told him.

283
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,203
我说“往南走 你还在射击范围内”
"Move South," I've said. "You're still in range."

284
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,687
他们根本不了解 现在武器的威力！
They simply will not understand what modern weapons do!

285
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,568
挺身而战！
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

286
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,170
向他们还击！
Fire back at them.

287
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,289
-你是谁？ -劳伦斯中尉，长官
-Who are you? -Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

288
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,249
我隶属于阿拉伯局
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

289
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,728
这真的是一团乱 我们真的得往南走
This is a bloody mess, sir. We'll have to move south.

290
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,327
是的，上校，往南走五十里
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

291
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,444
你说的对，我错了
You were right and I was wrong.

292
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
我们得想想如何处理伤者
We must take some thought for the wounded.

293
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,283
-我们可以到阳波帮他们疗伤 -只要他们到得了阳波
-We can take care of them at Yenbo. -If they can get to Yenbo.

294
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,050
他们不可能跟我们一起走
They can hardly come with us.

295
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,649
不，他们得试着到阳波去 那个…？
No. They must try to reach Yenbo. Lieutenant...?

296
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,686
劳伦斯
Lawrence.

297
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,361
你明白的，劳伦斯中尉
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence...

298
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,646
我的人不习惯炸药跟机器
...my people are unused to explosives and machines.

299
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,171
先是枪，现在又是这个
First the guns, and now this.

300
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,046
有香烟吗？
Cigarette?

301
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,730
抱歉
I'm sorry.

302
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,408
有烟吗？殿下
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

303
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,605
走开
Umph off.

304
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,284
拜托，殿下 就给我们两个人一根烟？
Please, Your Excellency. Just one for two?

305
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,121
等一下，贾金斯！
Hold it, Jenkins!

306
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,930
贾金斯！
Jenkins!

307
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,930
劳伦斯？
Lawrence?

308
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,685
你没有带随从
You have no servant.

309
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,446
-我不需要随从 -是吗？
-I don't need a servant. -No?

310
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,446
我们什么都会做 生火，煮食物，洗衣服
We can do everything. Light fires, cook food, wash clothes.

311
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,642
-对，什么都会做 -我不怀疑
-Yes, everything. -I don't doubt it.

312
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,003
-那对你来说是件好事 -我负担不起
-It will be very nice for you. -I can't afford it.

313
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,523
那么尽可能地朗读古兰经吧
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.

314
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,486
天知道你们当中有些病人
God knoweth that there be some among you sick...

315
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,730
其他人在世界到处旅行 寻找真主的恩赐
...while others travel through the Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

316
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,324
其他人为他而战
Others do battle in his cause.

317
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,889
所以尽可能地朗读吧
Recite, therefore, as much as may be easy.

318
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,324
服从经文
And observe the prayers.

319
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,970
这将会是最好 最丰硕的报答
This will be best and richest in the recompense.

320
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,005
寻求真主的宽恕
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

321
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,846
真主是会原谅你 他是那么地仁慈…
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful--

322
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,530
你好啊，阿里
Greetings, Ali.

323
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,523
-殿下 -阿里长官
-My lord. -Sherif Ali.

324
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,964
劳伦斯中尉 我想你见过阿里长官了
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met Sherif Ali, l think.

325
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,683
是的，殿下
Yes, my lord.

326
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,487
这是赛林姆的“光明”
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

327
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,047
“经由中午的光明”
"By the noonday brightness...

328
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,368
“跟天黑后的夜晚”
...and by the night when it darkeneth...

329
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,046
“真主是不会遗弃你的”
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

330
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,726
“他也不会不悦”
...neither hath He been displeased.

331
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,244
“你的未来当然比过去好”
And surely the future shall be better for thee than the past."

332
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,047
“在最后真主 将会慷慨地赐福于你”
"And in the end shall your Lord be bounteous to thee...

333
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,567
“而你将会满足”
...and thou be satisfied."

334
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,885
那么？
So?

335
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,040
是的，上校
Yes, colonel.

336
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,126
-我要你做决定，长官 -你要我撤退回阳波
-I want a decision, sir. -You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

337
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,051
你在这里没有大用途
Well, you're not doing much good here, sir.

338
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,251
我很抱歉这么说 但在这里我们不能为你提供补给
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we can't supply you here.

339
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,408
你可以从阿卡巴来补给我们！
You could supply us through Aqaba!

340
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,404
阿卡巴！
Aqaba!

341
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,925
如果你守得住阿卡巴 我们就能给你补给
If you can get ahold of Aqaba, we can supply you.

342
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,082
-但是你们不能！ -你们可以的
-But you can't! -You could.

343
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,166
你是指海军吗？
You mean, the navy?

344
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,402
土耳其人在阿卡巴 部署了十二寸的机关枪
The Turks have 1 2-inch guns at Aqaba, sir.

345
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,642
你可以想像那是什么意思吗？
Can you imagine what that means?

346
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,604
对，我想像得到
Yes, I can imagine.

347
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,044
别想了，海军还有别的事要做
Put that out of your mind, sir. The navy's got other things to do.

348
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,766
对，保护苏伊士运河
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

349
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,167
前线最重要的地方就是运河
The one essential sector of this front is and must be the canal.

350
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,283
你应该明白的
You can see that, sir, surely.

351
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,444
我知道英国人对运河有兴趣
I see that the canal is an essential British interest.

352
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,648
那对我们来说没什么影响
It is of little consequence to us.

353
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,208
请你不要那么说
I must ask you not to speak like that.

354
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,125
英国跟阿拉伯的目标是一样的
British and Arab interests are one and the same.

355
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,124
有可能
Possibly.

356
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,081
我得说，先生，你很不知感激
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

357
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,965
撤退回阳波 我们会补充设备给你的
Fall back on Yenbo and we will give you equipment.

358
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,327
给你武器，建议，训练 什么都可以
Give you arms, advice, training, everything.

359
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,450
-枪呢？ -每个人都能有现代的来福枪
-Guns? -A modern rifle for every man.

360
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,644
不，枪，大跑
No. Guns. Artillery.

361
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,128
像是土耳其人在麦地纳用的枪
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

362
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,409
对，给我们枪，不用训练我们
Yes, give us guns and keep the training.

363
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,326
你的手下 最需要的是训练而不是枪
Your men need training far more than guns, sir.

364
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,250
英国人要教 贝都因人如何战斗？
English will teach Bedu to fight?

365
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,610
阿里长官，我们会教他们 对抗一只现代化的机械式军队
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight a modern mechanised army.

366
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,370
是的，中尉？ 阳波的事你意见如何？
Yes, lieutenant? What do you think about Yenbo?

367
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,044
我觉得那里离大马士革很远
I think it is far from Damascus.

368
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,642
我们会把你送到大马士革的，别害怕
We'll have you in Damascus, sir. Never fear.

369
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,890
你去过大马士革吗？劳伦斯先生
Have you been in Damascus, Mr. Lawrence?

370
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,891
去过，殿下
Yes, my lord.

371
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,570
那里很漂亮，对吧？
It is beautiful, is it not?

372
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,524
-非常漂亮 -那就行了，劳伦斯
-Very . -That will do, Lawrence.

373
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,845
梦想不会带你去大马士革 但是自律可以
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus, but discipline will.

374
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,160
听着，英国是一个小国家 比你的国家还小
Look, Great Britain is a small country, much smaller than yours.

375
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,687
跟某些国家相比人口很少
Small population compared with some.

376
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,089
它很小但很伟大，为什么？
It's small, but it's great. And why?

377
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,204
-因为它有枪 -因为它有自律
-Because it has guns. -Because it has discipline.

378
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,687
因为它有海军，所以…
Because it has a navy, because of this...

379
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,569
英国人想去哪里都行
...the English go where they please...

380
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,411
想攻击哪里都没问题 所以他们才会很伟大
...and strike where they please. This makes them great.

381
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,808
-对 -劳伦斯先生，那样就行了
-Right. -Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

382
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,281
劳伦斯不是你的军事顾问
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

383
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,682
但我想听听他的意见
But I would like to hear his opinion.

384
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,287
该死！ 你听谁的命令呢？
Damn it! Who do you take your orders from?

385
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,967
在费瑟的帐篷里 当然是费瑟殿下
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

386
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,491
老笨蛋！为什么问完他后问他 他们一个是主人，一个是随从
Old fool! Why turn from him to him? They are master and man.

387
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,286
殿下，我认为…
My lord, I think....

388
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,402
我认为你的书说的对
I think your book is right.

389
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,123
沙漠是个没有船的海洋
The desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped.

390
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,402
在这片海洋中贝都因人…
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they please...

391
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,085
想去哪里，想攻击那里都行
...and strike where they please.

392
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,561
贝都因人一直是这样作战的
This is the way the Bedu has always fought.

393
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,724
你因这个战法而名闻世界
You're famed through the world for fighting this way.

394
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,128
你现在正需要这样打法
And this is the way you should fight now.

395
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,970
我不知道
I don't know.

396
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,447
抱歉，先生，你错了
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

397
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,404
撤退回阳波，阿拉伯提升组织 将成为英军的一个单位
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising becomes one unit in the British army.

398
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,802
-对你来说这有什么好处？ -你是个叛徒
-What is this to you? -You're a traitor.

399
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,082
不，上校
No, colonel.

400
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,608
他是个年轻人，年轻人充满了热忱
He is a young man, and young men are passionate.

401
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,923
他们得说出想说的话
They must say their say.

402
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,086
但聪明人得下决定 我知道你是对的
But wiser people must decide. I know you are right.

403
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,806
那么，我们何时走？越快越好
Very well. When shall we move? The sooner the better.

404
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,600
你今晚会失去五十个手下
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

405
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,608
你的语气很强硬
You tread heavily...

406
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,325
但你说的话都是真的
...but you speak the truth.

407
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,442
我明天会告诉你答案 但是现在…
I will give you my answer tomorrow. And now...

408
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,649
已经很晚了
...it is late.

409
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,840
布莱顿上校想把我的人…
Colonel Brighton means to put my men...

410
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,890
纳入欧洲军官麾下，对吧？
...under European officers, does he not?

411
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,003
可以说，是的
In effect, my lord, yes.

412
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,322
我必须这么做
And l must do it...

413
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,646
因为土耳其人有欧洲人的枪
...because the Turks have European guns.

414
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,571
但我害怕这么做
But I fear to do it...

415
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,687
我以灵魂发誓，我真的怕
...upon my soul I do.

416
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,850
英国人对荒凉之地比较有兴趣
The English have a great hunger for desolate places.

417
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,203
我怕他们想拿下阿拉伯
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

418
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,369
那你得挺身抵抗
Then you must deny it to them.

419
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,207
你是英国人，你不忠于英国吗？
You are an Englishman. Are you not loyal to England?

420
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,810
我效忠于英国跟其他事情
To England and to other things.

421
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,691
你同时效忠于英国跟阿拉伯？
To England and Arabia both?

422
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,689
那可能吗？
And is that possible?

423
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,684
我觉得你是 那种喜欢沙漠的英国人
I think you are another of these desert-loving English.

424
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,042
多夫提，史丹霍普
Doughty, Stanhope...

425
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,967
卡杜姆的葛登
...Gordon of Khartoum.

426
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,441
阿拉伯人不喜欢沙漠
No Arab loves the desert.

427
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,720
我们喜欢水跟绿树 在沙漠里什么都没有
We love water and green trees. There is nothing in the desert.

428
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,206
人都是有需求的
And no man needs nothing.

429
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,927
或是你们觉得 我们是你们能玩弄的东西
Or is it that you think we are something you can play with...

430
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,761
因为我们是弱小愚蠢的民族
...because we are a little people, a silly people...

431
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,250
贪婪，野蛮又残忍？
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

432
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,848
中尉，你知道 在阿拉伯的卡杜巴市…
Or do you know, lieutenant, in the Arab city of Cordoba...

433
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,566
有两里长的街道设有路灯
...were two miles of lighting in the streets...

434
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,489
当时伦敦还只是个小村子
...when London was a village.

435
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,564
对，你们很伟大
Yes, you were great.

436
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,922
那是九世纪前的事
Nine centuries ago.

437
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,367
该是你们恢复光荣的时候了，殿下
Time to be great again, my lord.

438
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,882
所以我父亲 决定对土耳其人发动战争
Which is why my father made this war upon the Turks.

439
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,880
劳伦斯先生，是我父亲 不是英国人
My father, Mr. Lawrence, not the English.

440
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,367
但我父亲老了
But my father is old...

441
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,089
而我…
...and I...

442
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,481
我渴望着废弃的卡杜巴花园
...I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba.

443
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,290
然而在得到花园前 得先经历苦战
However, before the gardens must come the fighting.

444
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,491
要再度恢复光荣 看起来我们需要英国人
To be great again, it seems that we need the English...

445
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,761
或是…
...or....

446
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,445
或是？
Or?

447
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,606
没有人能提供的东西 劳伦斯先生
What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence.

448
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,280
我们需要奇迹
We need a miracle.

449
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,647
阿卡巴
Aqaba.

450
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,531
阿卡巴

451
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,964
从陆地进攻
From the land.

452
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,724
你疯了
You are mad.

453
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,529
经由陆路到阿卡巴 我们得越过尼法德沙漠
To come to Aqaba by land we should have to cross the Nefud Desert.

454
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,006
没错
That's right.

455
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,482
没人能越过尼法德沙漠
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

456
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,603
如果你愿意的话，我可以穿越过它
I'll cross it if you will.

457
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,010
你？只靠罗盘是办不到的，英国人
You? It takes more than a compass, Englishman.

458
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,010
尼法德沙漠是真主创造出来 最可怕的地方
The Nefud is the worst place God created.

459
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,245
我无法为地点做主 我只能为自己作主
I can't answer for the place. Only for myself.

460
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,170
五十个士兵？
Fifty men?

461
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,006
只靠五十个士兵拿下阿卡巴？
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

462
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,646
如果这五十个人 能穿越尼法德沙漠
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

463
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,889
会有其他人 加入这五十个人的行列
...they would be 50 men other men might join.

464
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,001
听说霍威塔特人在那里
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

465
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,364
霍威塔特人是土匪 他们愿意把自己出卖给任何人
The Howeitat are brigands. They'll sell themselves to anyone.

466
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,847
-但他们是好战士 -没错
-Good fighters, though. -Good--

467
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,242
对，阿卡巴有枪跑
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

468
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,650
枪跑都面对大海，阿里长官 而且都无法转向
They face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot be turned around.

469
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,561
就内陆这个方面来说 在阿卡巴没有枪
From the landward side, there are no guns at Aqaba.

470
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,886
是有理由的 我们无法从内陆接近阿卡巴
With good reason. It cannot be approached from the landward side.

471
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,731
土耳其人绝对想像不到的
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

472
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,162
阿卡巴在那里
Aqaba's over there.

473
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,927
现在只要决定去
It's only a matter of going.

474
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,407
你疯了
You are mad.

475
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,086
你要去哪里？中尉
And where are you going, lieutenant?

476
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,448
还带着我的五十个兄弟
With 50 of my men.

477
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,286
去实现你的奇迹
To work your miracle.

478
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,924
咒骂神明不是旅程的好开始
Blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a journey.

479
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,251
-谁跟你说的？ -阿里
-Who told you? -Ali did.

480
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,129
为什么不是你呢？
Why not you?

481
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,764
你要从阳波撤退吗？
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

482
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,241
对，我必须撤退
Yes, I must.

483
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,603
但我会让你不必如此
But I will spare these to you.

484
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,609
阿里是否违反誓言告诉我？
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

485
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,125
阿里长官对你效忠，殿下
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my lord.

486
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,606
但你没告诉布莱顿上校
Yet you did not tell Colonel Brighton.

487
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,847
对
No.

488
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,722
既然你知道…
Since you do know...

489
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,801
我们可以以麦加费瑟之名展开远征
...we can claim to arrive in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

490
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,448
对，劳伦斯中尉，你可以那么说
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim it.

491
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,363
但你要以谁之名展开远征呢？
But in whose name do you ride?

492
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,611
长官，我抓到他们 他们一直在跟踪我们
Sherif, I caught them. They have tracked us.

493
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,127
他们来到这里，我抓到他们
They were here. I caught them.

494
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,204
你们为什么要来这里？小子
Why are you here? Boy!

495
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,329
为了服侍劳伦斯大人，沙利夫
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

496
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,206
真的，劳伦斯 他们真的希望那么做
This is true, Lawrence. They do wish it.

497
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,283
你们一直在跟踪我们
You have been tracking us.

498
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,201
-你奉命要留下来 -不，沙利夫
-You were told to stay. -No, sherif.

499
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,522
我们的骆驼迷路了 我们跟着他走
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

500
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,690
他带我们来这里 当劳伦斯大人的随从
She led us here to be Lord Lawrence's servants.

501
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,566
-这是阿拉的旨意 -你们轻视神明
-It is the will of Allah. -Blasphemy.

502
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,040
别那么做！
Don't do that.

503
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,242
不，劳伦斯，这些人不是随从 他们是无父无母，被放逐的人
No, Lawrence, these are not servants. These are outcasts, parent-less.

504
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,571
我得警告你，他们并不适合
Be warned. They are not suitable.

505
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,566
他们听起来挺适合的 你们负责载运行李
They sound very suitable. You can ride with the baggage.

506
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,647
他们不是随从，他们是朝圣者
These are not servants. These are worshippers.

507
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,484
每星期一先令？
One shilling, every week?

508
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,324
那很公平
That is fair.

509
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,331
-每个人吗？ -不
-Each? -No.

510
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,170
-那太多了 -好吧
-That is too much. -All right.

511
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,970
能被你雇用是他们运气好 阿拉喜欢仁慈的人
They will be lucky for you. Allah favours the compassionate.

512
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,604
铁路在那边
There is the railway.

513
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,404
那边是沙漠
And that is the desert.

514
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,566
从这里到另一边，没有水源 只有我们带来的水
From here until the other side, no water but what we carry.

515
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,088
骆驼根本没水喝
For the camels, no water at all.

516
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,882
如果骆驼死了…
If the camels die...

517
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,565
我们就死定了
...we die.

518
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,285
在二十天后，他们会开始死亡
And in 20 days they will start to die.

519
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,043
那么我们别浪费时间了，对吧？
There's no time to waste, then, is there?

520
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,889
我在思考
I was thinking.

521
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,809
你在打瞌睡
You were drifting.

522
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,446
对，以后不会再发生这种事了
Yes. It will not happen again.

523
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,406
小心，你在打瞌睡
Be warned, you were drifting.

524
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,122
以后不会再发生这种事了
It will not happen again.

525
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,129
那些水浪费了
That water is wasted.

526
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,847
从现在开始我们要在晚上出发
From now on, we must travel by night...

527
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,010
热到不能行走时就休息
...and rest while it is too hot to travel.

528
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,687
每天只能走几小时
A few hours each day.

529
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,488
我们为什么不现在出发呢？
Why don't we start now?

530
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,371
不，我们现在休息
No. We will rest now.

531
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,326
三小时
Three hours.

532
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,005
好吧
Fine.

533
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,050
我会叫你的
I'll wake you.

534
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,124
我们要在这里休息？
Do we rest here?

535
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,529
没有水，现在别休息
There is no rest now short of water.

536
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,802
那儿的另一边
The other side of that.

537
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,122
那边有多少那儿呢？
And how much of that is there?

538
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,005
我不确定
I'm not sure.

539
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,489
但不管有多少，我们得在 明天太阳升起前越过它
But however much, it must be crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.

540
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,801
这是个太阳的铁砧
This is the sun's anvil.

541
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,640
完成了吗？
Have we done it?

542
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,049
还没，但我们逃过一劫
No, but we're off the anvil.

543
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,445
谢天谢地
Thank God for that anyway.

544
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,563
对，谢天谢地
Yes, thank him.

545
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,401
劳伦斯，我想你不知道 你是怎么唆使他的
Lawrence, I do not think you know how you have tempted him.

546
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,966
我知道
I know.

547
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,805
我们完成了
We've done it.

548
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,650
上天保佑
God willing.

549
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,808
我们何时能到达水井？
When do we reach the wells?

550
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,369
上天保佑，中午
God willing, midday.

551
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,287
-那么我们成功了 -感谢上天吧，劳伦斯
-Then we've done it. -Thank him, Lawrence. Thank him.

552
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,570
是嘉西姆的
Gasim's.

553
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,169
他怎么了？
What's happened to him?

554
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,450
天知道
God knows.

555
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,009
你为什么不停下来？
Why don't you stop?

556
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,967
为什么？他中午就会死的
For what? He will be dead by midday.

557
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,089
我们得回去
We must go back.

558
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,170
为什么？为了跟嘉西姆一起死吗？
What for, to die with Gasim?

559
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,721
一小时内太阳会升起
In one hour comes the sun.

560
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,882
以上天为名，听清楚！ 我们不能回头！
In God's name, understand! We cannot go back!

561
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,491
我可以
I can.

562
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,004
把那些男孩带着
Take the boys.

563
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,326
如果你回头，你会害自己没命的
If you go back, you kill yourself, is all.

564
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,847
你已经杀了嘉西姆
Gasim you have killed already.

565
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,651
滚开
Get out of my way.

566
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,846
嘉西姆的时间到了，劳伦斯 那是注定的
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence. It is written.

567
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,371
没有什么事是注定的！
Nothing is written!

568
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,931
那么掉头吧！
Go back, then!

569
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,688
你为什么凭着你咒神又自大地 带着我们来到此地？
What did you bring us here for with your blasphemous conceit?

570
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,569
咒神的英国人！
English blasphemer!

571
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,284
阿卡巴？
Aqaba?

572
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,569
那是阿卡巴吗？
Was it Aqaba?

573
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,165
你到不了阿卡巴的，英国人！
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

574
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,770
掉头吧，咒神狂
Go back, blasphemer...

575
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,362
但你到不了阿卡巴的！
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

576
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,449
我会去阿卡巴的
I shall be at Aqaba.

577
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,728
那是注定的…
That is written.

578
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,646
在这里
In here.

579
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,289
英国人！
English!

580
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,210
英国人！

581
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,204
劳伦斯！杜德！
Lawrence! Daud!

582
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,728
没有什么事是注定的
Nothing is written.

583
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,524
艾尔劳伦斯
Al Lawrence.

584
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,371
法拉吉
Farraj.

585
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,641
洗一洗
Wash.

586
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,569
艾尔劳伦斯
Al Lawrence.

587
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:13,648
真的，那些不相信命运的人 总是要眼见为凭
Truly, for some men nothing is written unless they write it.

588
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,324
不是艾尔劳伦斯 只是劳伦斯
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

589
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,285
-艾尔劳伦斯比较好 -没错
-Al Lawrence is better. -True.

590
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,886
你爸爸也一样吗？ 只是劳伦斯先生
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

591
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,010
我父亲是汤?斯查普曼爵士
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

592
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,005
-他是个贵族吗？ -算是吧
-Is that a lord? -A kind of lord.

593
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,125
当他死了之后，你会继承他的地位
Then when he dies, you too will be a lord.

594
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,566
不
No.

595
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,529
你有哥哥
You have an elder brother.

596
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,920
不
No.

597
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:56,211
但我不明白，你父亲姓查普曼
But then, I do not understand this. Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,728
他没娶我母亲
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,884
我懂了
I see.

600
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,771
抱歉
I'm sorry.

601
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,645
那么我想你可以 自由地选择你的姓氏
It seems to me that you are free to choose your own name, then.

602
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,726
对，我想是的
Yes, I suppose I am.

603
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,769
艾尔劳伦斯是最棒的
Al Lawrence is best.

604
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,850
好吧，那就叫艾尔劳伦斯吧
All right, l'll settle for Al Lawrence.

605
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,603
这是班尼威哈长官的袍子
They are the robes of a sherif of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,964
非常好
Very fine.

607
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,045
-我很荣幸 -我们也很荣幸，您好，长官
-Great honour. -The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,726
-可以这样吗？ -当然
-Is it permitted? -Surely.

609
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,960
没有注定姓氏的人可以 自由地注定你的家族
He for whom nothing is written may write himself a clan.

610
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,248
穿了袍子骑骆驼很方便，试试看
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,049
你在做什么？英国人
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,965
你都看到了
As you see.

613
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,287
你一个人吗？
Are you alone?

614
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,364
差不多吧
Almost.

615
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,440
你跟那些从我井里 取水喝的狗在一起吗？
Are you with those dogs drinking at my well?

616
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,125
那是你的井？
Yours?

617
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,489
我是奥达阿布塔耶
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,124
我听说过另一个跟你同名的人
I've heard of another man of that name.

619
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,729
另一个人？什么另一个人？
Other? What other?

620
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,290
我听说过的那个奥达 不需要别人帮忙保护他的水井
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,962
他一定是个大英雄
He must be a great hero.

622
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,889
是的
He is.

623
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,329
他不会拒绝提供水 给从尼法德沙漠走出来的人
He wouldn't refuse water to men coming out of Nefud Desert.

624
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,722
是吗？
Now, would he not?

625
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,164
对，所以他一定是另一个人
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,529
我的助手来了
Here is my help.

627
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,885
孩子，这是什么服装？
Son, what fashion is this?

628
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,886
-这是哈利斯的服装 -哈利斯的什么部族？
-Harith, Father. -What manner of Harith?

629
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,851
这是班尼威哈长官的袍子
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,365
他是哈利斯人吗？
And is he Harith?

631
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,767
不，他是英国人
No, Father, English.

632
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,371
孩子
Son...

633
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,282
他们在偷我们的水
...they are stealing our water.

634
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,043
告诉他们我们来了
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,881
告诉他们
Tell them.

636
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,484
-倒光它！ -不要！
-Empty that! -Do not!

637
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,967
我是哈威塔特的奥达
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,768
我是哈利斯的阿里
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

639
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,246
哈利斯
Harith.

640
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,281
阿里
Ali.

641
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,241
你父亲还在偷东西吗？
Does your father still steal?

642
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,566
没有了
No.

643
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,164
奥达把我误认为 他自己的私生子吗？
Does Auda take me for one of his own bastards?

644
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,523
不，根本一点都不像
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,801
该死，你长得真像你父亲
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,170
-奥达是在奉承我 -你很容易就被奉承了
-Auda flatters me. -You are easily flattered.

647
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,160
我跟你父亲很熟
I knew your father well.

648
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,403
你认识你父亲吗？
Did you know your own?

649
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,488
我们有五十个人，你们只有两个 我们开枪射杀你们如何？
We are 50, you are two. How if we shot you down?

650
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,083
那么哈威塔特人会跟你们结下梁子
Why, then you have a blood feud with the Howeitat.

651
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,443
-你希望那样吗？ -在开罗的将军…
-Do you desire it? -Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,003
跟土耳其国王都不希望这样
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

653
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,361
叫你的人退下
Call off your men.

654
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,531
这光荣是属于无价值的
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,968
我才刚开始教他
I've only just begun to teach him.

656
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,444
你今天教了他什么？ 哈威塔特人的待客之道？
And what are you teaching him today? Howeitat hospitality?

657
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,682
别耍嘴皮子，英国人
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,722
-他是谁？ -他是费瑟王子的朋友
-Who is he? -A friend of Prince Feisal's.

659
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,409
-你希望我慇勤款待你？ -对
-So you desire my hospitality? -Yes.

660
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,090
他是你舌头吗？
Is he your tongue?

661
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,604
我们真的很希望
We do desire it.

662
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,889
如果你要的话，我会答应你的
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,243
我在我的夏日别墅 那是个简陋的地方
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:53,247
对我来说那是个简陋的地方 有些人觉得那里很棒
Well, to me it seems a poor place. Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,403
明天或许我会准土耳其人买下你 费瑟的朋友
Tomorrow, maybe l will allow the Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,926
但是…
But...

667
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,765
跟我共进晚餐吧
...dine with me.

668
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,610
跟奥达一起用餐，英国人
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,926
跟哈威塔特人一起用餐 哈利斯人
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:14,447
我很荣幸能跟你 一起在万迪拉姆用餐！
It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,766
你要进攻阿卡巴的事…
This thing you work against Aqaba...

672
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:00,566
你希望得到什么好处呢？
...what profit do you hope from it?

673
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:03,366
我们是为了麦加的费瑟才这么做的
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,682
哈利斯人做事不是为了求好处
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,606
如果有人一定要当仆人的话 阿里长官…
Well, if it is in a man to be a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,606
也算是个好主人
...he could find worse masters than Feisal.

677
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,764
但我不能那么做
But I.... I cannot serve.

678
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,689
你允许土耳其人待在阿卡巴
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

679
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,962
对，那是我的荣幸
Yes, it is my pleasure.

680
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:31,442
我们这么做不是为了费瑟
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:32,961
是吗？
No?

682
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,685
-那么是为了英国人？ -是为了阿拉伯人
-For the English, then? -For the Arabs.

683
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,725
阿拉伯人？
The Arabs?

684
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:43,809
哈威塔特，阿吉亚尔，鲁阿拉 班尼夏卡尔，我知道这些部族
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala, Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,002
我听说过哈利斯人
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,170
但是阿拉伯人？
But the Arabs?

687
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,802
那是什么部族？
What tribe is that?

688
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,644
他们是奴隶 他们服侍土耳其人
They're a tribe of slaves. They serve the Turks.

689
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,888
他们对我来说什么都不是
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,049
我是哈威塔特人
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,607
做事只求好处
Who work only for profit.

692
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,484
我们做事只为了取悦奥达
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:08,325
而奥达的乐趣在于服侍土耳其人
And Auda's pleasure is to serve the Turks.

694
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,641
服侍？
Serve?

695
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,167
我会服侍人？
I serve?

696
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,045
拿钱的人是仆人
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,049
我是奥达阿布塔耶
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

698
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,163
-奥达会服侍人吗？ -不
-Does Auda serve? -No!

699
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:26,529
-奥达会服侍人吗？ -不
-Does Auda Abu Tayi serve? -No!

700
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:35,290
我身上的二十三处伤痕 都是在战争中受的伤
I carry 23 great wounds, all got in battle.

701
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:39,247
我在战争中亲手杀了七十五个人
75 men have I killed with my own hands, in battle.

702
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,650
我屠杀燃烧敌人的帐篷 我夺走他们的族人跟牲畜
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents. I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,970
土耳其人付我金子 但我还是很穷！
The Turks pay me a golden treasure, yet I am poor!

704
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,364
因为我是人民的河流
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,201
那是服侍吗？
Is that service?

706
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,046
不是
No.

707
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,287
看来奥达老了
And yet now it seems Auda has grown old.

708
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,245
失去了他的战斗力
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,564
你敢在我的帐篷里这么说 真是大胆
It is well you say it in my tent, thou old tulip.

710
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,560
这个胆大的人 是土耳其人收买不了的
Yet this is a tulip that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,563
他们为什么要收买他？
Why should they wish to?

712
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:30,801
好了
Now....

713
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:35,564
我告诉你他们给我什么 你告诉我这是否是…
I will tell you what they pay me, and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,087
仆人的薪水
...a servant's wages.

715
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,245
他们每个月付我…
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:46,604
一百个金币
...1 00 golden guineas.

717
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,923
是一百五十个，奥达
1 50, Auda.

718
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,090
-是谁告诉你的？ -我的耳朵挺尖的
-Who told you that? -I have long ears.

719
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,601
你的舌头也很长
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,162
一百跟一百五十有什么差别？ 那只不过是一点钱
1 00, 1 50, what matters? It's a trifle.

721
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:04,160
他们是从一个大箱子 拿出这么一点钱来的
A trifle which they take from a great box they have.

722
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,362
在阿卡巴
In Aqaba.

723
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,331
-在阿卡巴 -不然还有哪里？
-In Aqaba? -Where else?

724
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,130
你像女人一样令我烦心
You trouble me like women.

725
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,603
朋友，我们太愚蠢了 奥达不会去的
Friends, we've been foolish. Auda will not come to Aqaba.

726
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,441
-为了钱？ -不
-For money? -No.

727
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,961
-为了费瑟？ -不
-For Feisal? -No!

728
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,243
也不是为了赶走土耳其人
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,889
他会去…
He will come...

730
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:30,121
因为那是他的荣幸
...because it is his pleasure.

731
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:35,806
你妈跟蝎子上床
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,647
愿老天爷领导你们！
Make God your agent!

733
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,167
阿卡巴！
Aqaba!

734
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,044
阿卡巴！

735
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,722
愿真主与你同在
God be with you.

736
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,330
愿真主与你同在

737
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,366
愿真主与你同在

738
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,848
愿真主与你同在

739
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,890
对
Yes.

740
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,247
阿卡巴
Aqaba.

741
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,531
明天我们会拿下它
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,730
-你觉得我们会成功吗？ -会
-Do you think we shall? -Yes.

743
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,645
如果枪跑的事你没说错
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,291
他杀人，他得死
He killed. He dies.

745
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,247
阿卡巴的事到此结束
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,763
我们的人杀了奥达的手下
One of our men murdered Auda's man.

747
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,921
为什么？
Why?

748
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,169
小偷？世仇？为什么并不重要
Theft? Blood feud? It makes no matter why.

749
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:20,846
阿里！
Ali!

750
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,083
那是道旧伤口
It is an ancient wound.

751
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,284
我不是来这里看部族血战的
I didn't come here to watch a tribal bloodbath.

752
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,922
这是法律，劳伦斯
It is the law, Lawrence.

753
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:35,441
法律说这个人得死
The law says the man must die.

754
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,443
如果他死了 哈威塔特人就满意了？
If he dies, will that content the Howeitat?

755
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,680
对
Yes.

756
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:46,810
阿里长官！
Sherif Ali!

757
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,964
如果奥达大人的手下 不伤害你们…
If none of Lord Auda's men harms any of yours...

758
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,563
-那么哈利斯人会满足吗？ -对
-...will that content the Harith? -Yes.

759
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,326
那么我要执行法律
Then I will execute the law.

760
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,482
我没有部族
I have no tribe.

761
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,007
没人犯法
And no one is offended.

762
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,481
嘉西姆
Gasim.

763
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,411
那是你做的吗？
Did you do it?

764
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,010
劳伦斯
Well, Lawrence....

765
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,931
英国人在烦恼什么？
What ails the Englishman?

766
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:09,562
他杀的那个人是 他从尼法德沙漠救回来的
That that he killed was the man he brought out of the Nefud.

767
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,802
那么那是注定好的
It was written, then.

768
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,688
早知不去救他
Better to have left him.

769
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,602
这是在行刑，劳伦斯 没有什么可耻的
It was execution, Lawrence. No shame in that.

770
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,281
而且这是必要的
Besides, it was necessary.

771
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,601
你让他生，又让他死
You gave life and you took it.

772
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,730
还是由你注定
The writing is still yours.

773
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,002
奥达阿布塔耶！
Auda Abu Tayi!

774
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,281
奇迹发生了
The miracle is accomplished.

775
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,930
征服者的光荣
Garlands for the conqueror.

776
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,203
给王子的贡品，给英雄的花
Tribute for the prince. Flowers for the man.

777
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,684
我什么都不是，阿里
I'm none of those things, Ali.

778
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,566
-那么你是什么？ -我不知道
-What, then? -Don't know.

779
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,971
谢谢
Thanks.

780
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:05,642
天啊，我爱这个国家
My God, I love this country.

781
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,321
什么！
What!

782
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,249
阿卡巴里没黄金！
No gold in Aqaba!

783
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:15,001
奥达，我找到了！
Auda, I found it!

784
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:25,850
那真的是太可惜了
That's a pity.

785
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,971
阿里，把消息传到阳波的海边去
Ali, get a message down the coast to Yenbo.

786
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,680
告诉费瑟找船，什么船都行
Tell Feisal to find boats, any boats...

787
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:38,049
尽快把阿拉伯军队带到阿卡巴来
...and bring the Arab army here to Aqaba, quickly.

788
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,401
你呢？
And you?

789
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,726
我要去告诉…
I'm going to tell the generals...

790
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,043
在开罗的将军们
...in Cairo.

791
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,561
对，穿过西奈半岛
Yes, cross Sinai.

792
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,881
来吧！
Come on!

793
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,531
西奈半岛？
Sinai?

794
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,371
对
Yes.

795
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,566
-跟这些人？ -他们跟我在一起没事的
-With these? -They'll be all right with me.

796
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,930
听着，阿里 如果你的贝都因人跑到开罗说：
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and said:

797
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:09,050
“我们拿下阿卡巴了” 将军们会一笑置之
"We've taken Aqaba," the generals would laugh.

798
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,131
我懂了
I see.

799
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,883
在开罗，你得脱下那些可笑的衣服
In Cairo you will put off these funny clothes.

800
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:19,290
你要穿上裤子 跟人们诉说我们的古怪跟野蛮
You'll wear trousers and tell stories of our quaintness and barbarity...

801
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,161
然后他们会相信你
...and then they will believe you.

802
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,927
你是个愚昧的人
You're an ignorant man.

803
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,365
纸张
Paper.

804
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,089
纸张！
Paper!

805
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,485
阿卡巴没有黄金
There is no gold in Aqaba.

806
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,443
没有黄金
No gold.

807
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,768
没有大箱子！
No great box!

808
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,281
奥达来到阿卡巴是为了黄金吗？
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

809
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,127
就像你说过的，我是为了荣幸
For my pleasure, as you said.

810
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,886
但黄金是荣耀的东西
But gold is honourable...

811
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,645
而劳伦斯答应会有黄金的
...and Lawrence promised gold.

812
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,881
劳伦斯说谎
Lawrence lied.

813
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,285
看好，奥达

01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:37,009
“五千个金币”

“我在此”

“签名”
...me.

821
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:55,482
十天内…
In 1 0 days...

822
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,328
我会带着黄金回来
...I'll be back with the gold.

823
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:04,167
我会带枪，黄金跟所有的东西回来
With gold, with guns, with everything.

824
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,844
十天
Ten days.

825
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:09,770
你要穿过西奈半岛？
You'll cross Sinai?

826
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,451
为什么不行？
Why not?

827
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,889
摩西曾那么做过
Moses did.

828
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,727
你要带着孩子们同行？
And you will take the children?

829
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:21,405
摩西曾那么做过
Moses did.

830
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:23,369
摩西是个圣徒
Moses was a prophet...

831
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,446
他受上帝的垂爱！
...and beloved of God.

832
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,890
他说过这里有黄金，他骗人
He said there was gold here. He lied.

833
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:40,050
他不完美
He is not perfect.

834
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,560
天啊，我们能不休息吗？
Lord, can we not rest?

835
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,883
我说过除非他们知道 我拿下阿卡巴，不然不能休息
I told you, no rest till they know that I have Aqaba.

836
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,804
你们两个试过在床上睡吗？
Have you two slept in beds?

837
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,286
法拉吉？
Farraj?

838
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:03,211
杜德？
Daud?

839
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:06,084
有床单的？
With sheets?

840
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,447
明天我们会在开罗最好的饭店里 最好的房间盖着最好的床单
Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

841
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,011
我保证
I promise.

842
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,925
那么就这么说定了，大人
Then it shall be so, lord.

843
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,611
你看！
Look!

844
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,964
是火柱
Pillar of fire.

845
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,162
不，大人，是灰尘
No, lord. Dust.

846
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,290
我的罗盘
My compass.

847
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,366
没关系
No matter.

848
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,561
如果我们往西走 一定可以走到运河那边
If we ride west, we must strike the canal.

849
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,045
往西前进
Due west.

850
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,205
来吧！
Come on!

851
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:51,251
劳伦斯！
Lawrence!

852
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,246
法拉吉
Farraj!

853
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,444
法拉吉，不要！…
Farraj, don't! Don't!

854
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,891
不要！
Don't!

855
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,521
你为什么要走？
Why do you walk?

856
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,203
为什么？大人
But why, lord?

857
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,800
为什么？大人

858
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,522
这可以乘坐两个人，走路没意思
There is room for both. It serves no purpose.

859
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,766
劳伦斯，你看！
Lawrence, look!

860
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,688
（警告）
It's all right, Farraj.

861
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,484
没关系的，法拉吉
It's all right.

862
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,289
没关系的
Who are you?

863
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:18,051
你是谁？

864
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:56,086
-杜德！ -我们在这里，大人
-Daud! -We're here, sir.

是你带他来的吗？
You taking him in there?

866
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,325
是的
Yes.

867
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:40,285
过来！
Here!

868
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,521
你给我过来！
Here. You!

869
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:49,562
你想去哪里啊？穆斯塔法
And where the hell do you think you're going to, Mustapha?

870
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:51,810
我们渴了
We are thirsty.

871
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:56,086
-劳伦斯先生，是吗？ -对
-Mr. Lawrence, is it? -Yes.

872
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:59,649
-你要去军官酒吧？ -对
-Are you going to the officers' bar? -Yes.

873
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,167
你不能带他进去，先生
You can't take him in there, sir.

874
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,366
你觉得你像什么东西？
What do you think you look like?

875
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:29,684
不，你得离开
No, no. You must go.

876
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,530
不，来吧，朋友！
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

877
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,125
滚出去！你得滚出去！滚出去！
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

878
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:42,044
我们要两杯大杯的柠檬汁
We want two large glasses of lemonade.

879
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:46,086
-这是英国军官的酒吧 -我们并不介意
-This is a bar for British officers. -We are not particular.

880
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:55,371
-你疯了吗？ -不，很奇怪地我没疯
-Are you off your head? -No. Oddly enough I'm not.

881
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:59,207
-请你快离开，好吗？ -让那孩子滚出去
-Just clear out of here, will you? -Get that boy out of here.

882
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:02,245
下士，我们要把这家伙赶出去
Corporal, we'll have this one out anyway.

883
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,451
-把那个混蛋赶出去 -滚开
-Get that wog out of here. -Clear off.

884
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,289
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

885
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:16,165
-是劳伦斯，长官 -我要加冰的柠檬汁
-It's Lawrence, sir. -Lemonade with ice.

886
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:19,084
你解释吧
Explain yourself.

887
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,564
我们拿下阿卡巴了
We've taken Aqaba.

888
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:24,765
-拿下阿卡巴？谁啊？ -我们
-Taken Aqaba? Who has? -We have.

889
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,483
我们的战友拿下阿卡巴 那些混蛋成功了
Our side in this war has. The wogs have.

890
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,605
我们成功了
We have.

891
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:35,249
他喜欢你的柠檬汁
He likes your lemonade.

892
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,523
你是说土耳其人离开了？
You mean the Turks have gone?

893
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,770
不，他们还在那儿 但是他们已经失势
No, they're still there but they've no boots.

894
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:45,410
我们把他们全都关了起来 所有的部队都被关了起来
Prisoners, sir. We took them prisoners. The entire garrison.

895
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:48,121
那不是真的，我们杀了一些人
That's not true. We killed some.

896
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:52,291
事实上是很多人 我下次会处理的更好
Too many, really. I'll manage it better next time.

897
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:56,490
不论如何都会死很多人
There's been a lot of killing one way or another.

898
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:02,127
我发毒誓，那是真的
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's all perfectly true.

899
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:05,130
-那是不可能的 -那是真的
-It isn't possible. -Yes, it is.

900
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,283
我做到了
I did it.

901
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,170
你最好去跟艾伦比谈谈
You'd better talk to Allenby.

902
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:17,211
-艾伦比将军？ -现在他是指挥官，墨瑞走了
-General Allenby? -He's in command. Murray's gone.

903
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:19,721
那么做是对的
That's a step in the right direction.

904
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:23,211
首先我要一个房间，要有床跟床单
First I want a room. With a bed, with sheets.

905
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,251
-对，当然 -那是给他的
-Yes, of course. -It's for him.

906
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:30,850
对，你要一张自己的床，对吧？
Right. You want a bed yourself, don't you?

907
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:33,162
但先去见艾伦比吧
See Allenby first, though.

908
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:35,450
他会见我吗？
Will he see me?

909
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,690
我想会的
I think so.

910
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:40,010
那么就去做吧
Do that, then.

911
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:47,486
-我最好去刮个胡子 -对，没错
-I'd better shave. -Yes, you had.

912
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:50,326
你最好去换条裤子
You'd better get into some trousers too.

913
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,363
不自律
"Undisciplined.

914
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,202
不守时
Unpunctual.

915
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:10,283
不整洁
Untidy.

916
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,248
数种语言
Several languages.

917
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,522
音乐
Knowledge of music...

918
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,209
文学的知识
...literature.

919
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:23,208
知识…
Knowledge of....

920
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,369
知识…
Knowledge of...."

921
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:32,530
毫无疑问地你是个有趣的人
You're an interesting man, there's no doubt about it.

922
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:36,283
-谁要你拿下阿卡巴 -没有人
-Who told you to take Aqaba? -Nobody.

923
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:39,251
-长官 -长官
-Sir. -Sir.

924
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:40,891
那么你为什么要那么做？
Then why did you?

925
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,566
-阿卡巴很重要 -为什么它很重要？
-Aqaba's important. -Why is it important?

926
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:46,331
-那是土耳其人到运河的路线 -不再是了
-It's the Turkish route to the canal. -Not anymore.

927
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,724
-他们现在从比尔沙巴走 -我知道，但我们进入了加萨
-They're coming through Beersheba. -I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

928
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:55,522
-所以呢？ -拿下阿卡巴对你来说很重要
-So? -So that left Aqaba behind your right.

929
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,127
真的
True.

930
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:01,962
当你到耶路撒冷时 阿卡巴对你来说就更重要了
And it will be further behind your right when you go for Jerusalem.

931
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,246
我要到耶路撒冷去？
Am I going for Jerusalem?

932
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,721
对
Yes.

933
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:10,525
非常好
Very well.

934
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:13,047
阿卡巴对我来说很重要
Aqaba behind my right.

935
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:16,130
它能威胁艾尔阿瑞许跟加萨
It threatened El' Arîsh and Gaza.

936
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,840
还有别的吗？
Anything else?

937
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:20,286
有
Yes.

938
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:23,046
阿卡巴跟麦地纳相连
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

939
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:26,604
你觉得我们现在 要把他们赶出麦地纳吗？
Do you think we should shift them out of Medina now?

940
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:30,447
不，我想你们 应该把他们留在那里
No. I think you should leave them there.

941
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:32,602
你在没接到 命令的情况下擅自行动
You acted without orders, you know.

942
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:37,564
军官不是随时 都该主动进取吗？
Shouldn't officers use their initiative at all times?

943
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:40,127
事实上不然，那太危险了
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

944
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,641
对，我知道
Yes, I know.

945
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,485
你已经知道了？
Already?

946
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:45,966
对
Yes.

947
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:50,331
我要把你升上少校
I'm promoting you major.

948
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:53,607
我不觉得那是个好主意
I don't think that's a very good idea.

949
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:56,883
我没问你意见，我要你回去…
I didn't ask you. I want you to go back...

950
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:00,806
继续执行你的成果
...and carry on the good work.

951
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:04,124
不，谢谢您，长官
No. Thank you, sir.

952
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:08,611
-为什么不？ -我，那个…
-Why not? -Well, I, it's....

953
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,131
我想想看…
Let me see now....

954
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:15,606
我杀了两个人，我是说阿拉伯人
I killed two people. I mean, two Arabs.

955
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:18,007
其中一个是个孩子
One was a boy.

956
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,685
那是…
That was...

957
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:23,163
昨天的事
...yesterday.

958
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,408
我把他领进流沙里
I led him into a quicksand.

959
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:27,324
另一个是个男人
The other was a man.

960
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:29,608
那是在…
That was...

961
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,241
我们拿下阿卡巴之前的事
...before Aqaba, anyway.

962
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:35,651
我得用我的枪来处决他
I had to execute him with my pistol.

963
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:39,169
我不喜欢这样的事
There was something about it I didn't like.

964
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:42,563
-当然 -不，还有别的事
-Well, naturally. -No. Something else.

965
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:47,161
没关系，把它当成是个警告吧
That's all right. Let it be a warning.

966
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:49,528
不，还有别的事
No. Something else.

967
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:52,724
什么事？
What, then?

968
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:56,007
我喜欢那样
I enjoyed it.

969
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:07,047
胡说八道，你疯了，你太累了
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves. You're tired.

970
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:12,401
你打扮成那样是什么意思？ 你现在是业余演员？
What do you mean coming dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?

971
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:14,369
对，没错
Yes. Entirely.

972
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,723
让我看看那个像帽子的东西
Let me see that hat thing or whatever it is.

973
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:20,042
他们的装备很棒
Fascinating gear they wear.

974
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:22,567
我穿起来怎么样？哈利
How would I look in this, Harry?

975
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:26,242
-很可笑，长官 -拿去，你留着吧
-Damn ridiculous, sir. -Here, you keep it.

976
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:31,245
我想说的是我并不适合
What I'm trying to say is I don't think I'm fit for it.

977
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:34,404
真的吗？你觉得呢？戴丹
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

978
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:39,962
在他那么做之前，长官 我会说那是不可能的
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it couldn't be done.

979
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:43,324
-布莱顿？ -我知道他的想法
-Brighton? -I know what he thinks.

980
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:47,802
我想你该进行授勋典礼
I think you should recommend a decoration, sir.

981
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:51,090
我觉得他的动机不重要
I don't think it matters what his motives were.

982
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:54,409
他指挥军队很出色
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

983
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:57,849
-柏金斯先生！ -长官！
-Mr. Perkins! -Sir!

984
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,731
我们去喝一杯吧，男士们
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

985
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:08,128
-你听说了吗？柏金斯先生 -我听说了
-You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins? -Yes, sir.

986
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:12,644
-你觉得如何？ -真的是太棒，长官，做得好
-What do you think about it? -Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

987
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:15,923
-谢谢你，柏金斯先生 -长官
-Thank you, Mr. Perkins. -Sir!

988
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,250
那么来吧
Come on, then.

989
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,609
你是个聪明人
You're a clever man, sir.

990
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:32,521
不，我懂得把握机会
No, but I know a good thing when I see one.

991
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:35,491
那很公平，对吧？
That's fair, surely?

992
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,166
若我得在耶路撒冷那边有突破 我得集中力量，不是消散力量
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem, I must concentrate, not dissipate.

993
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:03,647
-太棒了 -你懂吗？
-Bravo. -You know better?

994
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:26,044
我跟克劳西威兹般作战 然后你像萨克森一样作战
I fight like Clausewitz, then you fight like Saxe.

995
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:28,681
我们可以做得很好，对吧？
We should do very well indeed, shouldn't we?

996
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:07,720
男士们，轻松点
Easy, gentlemen, please.

997
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:11,087
-麻烦你端杯酒来 -没问题
-Give us something to drink. -Of course, sir.

998
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:15,207
我是受劳伦斯少校之邀前来的
I'm here at the invitation of Major Lawrence.

999
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:17,121
崔西
Tracy.

1000
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,883
我们要到外面去吗？
Shall we go outside?

1001
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:35,368
你牵制住土耳其的沙漠军队了？
So you hold bound the Turkish desert army?

1002
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,607
对
Yes.

1003
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,167
用一千个阿拉伯人？
With 1 000 Arabs?

1004
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,403
一千个阿拉伯人 代表一千把刀子
1 000 Arabs means 1 000 knives.

1005
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:45,562
不论日夜他们随时待命
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1006
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:47,804
代表着一千只骆驼
It means 1 000 camels.

1007
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:52,369
那代表一千包的炸药 跟一千把的来福枪
That means 1 000 packs of high explosives and 1 000 crack rifles.

1008
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:56,686
当土耳其人还在团团转时 我们可以越过阿拉伯
We can cross Arabia while Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1009
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:59,163
我要粉碎他们的铁路
I'll smash his railways.

1010
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,920
当他们忙着修护铁路时 我会在别地发动破坏行动
While he mends, I'll smash them somewhere else.

1011
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:04,970
在十三个星期内 我可以让阿拉伯陷于混乱
In 1 3 weeks I can have Arabia in chaos.

1012
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,601
那么你要回去罗？
You are going back, then?

1013
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:11,680
对
Yes.

1014
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:14,441
我当然要回去
Of course I'm going back.

1015
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:21,206
如果我们想得到 那么土耳其人也想得到
Well, if we can see it, so can the Turk.

1016
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:25,729
如果他们发现得用四个军队 来防守一小群的土匪…
If he finds he's using four divisions to fend off a handful of bandits...

1017
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:27,121
他们会撤退的
...he'll withdraw.

1018
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:30,045
他们不敢撤退的 阿拉伯是他们帝国的一部份
He daren't withdraw. Arabia's part of his empire.

1019
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:32,806
如果他们现在离开 他们永远都无法回来了
If he gets out now, he'll never get back again.

1020
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:35,566
-不知道谁能拥有此地 -没有人可以
-I wonder who will. -No one will.

1021
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:38,447
阿拉伯现在是阿拉伯人的
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1022
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:46,727
反正我是那么告诉他们的
That's what I've told them anyway.

1023
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:49,009
他们是那么想的
That's what they think.

1024
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:52,723
-那就是他们战斗的原因 -当然
-That's why they're fighting. -Oh, surely.

1025
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:58,001
他们只有一个怀疑
They've only one suspicion.

1026
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:02,843
我们让他们赶走土耳其人 然后自己占据了阿拉伯
That we'll let them drive the Turks out and then move in ourselves.

1027
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:07,523
我告诉他们那是不对的 我们对阿拉伯没兴趣
I've told them that that's false, that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1028
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:08,841
是吗？
Have we?

1029
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:11,482
谢天谢地，我不是政客
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1030
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:14,849
我们对阿拉伯有兴趣吗？戴丹
Have we any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?

1031
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:18,081
这是个很难的问题
Difficult question, sir.

1032
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:23,880
我想知道能否以你之名告诉他们
I want to know, sir, if I can tell them in your name...

1033
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:27,527
我们对阿拉伯没兴趣
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1034
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,050
当然可以
Certainly.

1035
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:51,042
两千件兵器还不够 我需要五千件
2000 small arms, not enough. I need five.

1036
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:52,401
好
Right.

1037
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:56,042
还有钱，我要金币 他们不喜欢纸钞
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns. They don't like paper.

1038
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:00,442
-路易斯枪只的指导老师 -好
-Instructors for the Lewis guns. -Right.

1039
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,210
更多的钱
More money.

1040
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:05,723
-更多是多少？ -现在要两万五，日后要更多
-How much more? -25,000 now. A lot more later.

1041
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:08,651
-戴丹？ -没问题，长官
-Dryden? -It can be done, sir.

1042
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:11,724
几部武装车辆
A couple of armoured cars.

1043
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:13,291
好
Right.

1044
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,570
大跑
Field artillery.

1045
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:19,131
好
Right.

1046
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,321
我会尽力提供你需要的东西
I'll give you every blessed thing l can...

1047
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:27,450
因为我知道你会用到它们，恭喜
...because I know you'll use it. Congratulations.

1048
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:30,405
谢谢你们的招待，绅士们
Thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.

1049
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:07,969
恭喜！
Congratulations!

1050
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:21,283
你真的要给他们大跑吗？长官
Are you really going to give them artillery, sir?

1051
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:23,329
我很怀疑啊
I was wondering that, sir.

1052
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,807
要把它们拿回来可能很难
Might be difficult to get it back.

1053
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,607
给他们大跑，等于让他们独立
Give them artillery and you've made them independent.

1054
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,723
那就不能给他们大跑，对吧？
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1055
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:33,883
-那是你的决定 -不是
-For you to say. -No, it's not.

1056
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:36,885
我得遵守命令，谢天谢地
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1057
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,128
跟那个可怜的家伙不同
Not like that poor devil.

1058
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:41,170
他像是在骑着旋风
He's riding the whirlwind.

1059
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:43,601
希望我们不是
Let's hope we're not.

1060
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:10,603
对不起，朋友 这些袋子是什么人的？
Excuse me, friend. Who do these bags belong to?

1061
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:12,366
是费瑟王子的
To Prince Feisal.

1062
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:15,365
-你不是费瑟王子吧？ -我不是
-You're not Prince Feisal? -No.

1063
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,005
你认识他吗？
You know him though?

1064
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:20,642
他是我的主人，我是他的仆人
He is my master. I am his servant.

1065
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,171
你识字吗？
Can you read?

1066
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,323
我是芝加哥快报的记者 但我文章在美国多家报社刊登
Chicago Courieris my paper, but my work is syndicated in America.

1067
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:42,127
我从你的来信中知道了 班特利先生
I understood so from your letter, Mr. Bentley.

1068
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,481
好了
Now....

1069
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:02,651
-我在哪里能找到劳伦斯少校？ -那是你来此地的目的吗？
-Where can I find Major Lawrence? -Is that what you have come for?

1070
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:05,008
我不是只为了这件事而来
Not altogether, sir, no.

1071
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:09,609
班特利先生 劳伦斯少校在我的军队里
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find Major Lawrence with my army.

1072
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:12,923
那就是我的意思，先生 我在哪里能找到你的军队？
That's what I meant, sir. Where can I find your army?

1073
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,361
我不知道
I don't know.

1074
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:17,725
-上星期他们在艾尔盖拉附近 -盖拉？
-Last week they were near El Ghira. -Ghira?

1075
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:21,766
对，恐怕你得走上一段路 你会骑骆驼吗？
Yes, I fear you have a long journey. Can you ride a camel?

1076
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:25,371
-我从来都没试过 -那你骑骡子吧
-I've never tried. -Take a mule.

1077
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:28,008
避开米拉哈，那里有土耳其人
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1078
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:31,006
他们现在在米拉哈？ 他们的动作真快
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1079
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,526
没错
They do.

1080
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:35,883
但没我们快，你会看到的
But not so fast as we do, you will find.

1081
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:37,730
我自己…
Myself...

1082
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:40,249
要到开罗去
...I am going to Cairo.

1083
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,442
-你是知道的 -对
-As you know. -Yes.

1084
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:45,206
那里有别的工作等着我去做
There's work for me there of a different kind.

1085
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:46,960
对
Yes.

1086
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:52,921
我知道你一直都没拿到大跑
I understand you've been given no artillery.

1087
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:55,931
-没错 -你陷入困境了？
-That is so. -You're handicapped?

1088
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,162
这让我们被局限在小事上
It restricts us to small things.

1089
02:25:58,360 --> 02:25:59,691
正是他们的计划
It's intended to.

1090
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:03,964
你认识艾伦比将军吗？
Do you know General Allenby?

1091
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:08,442
小心艾伦比 他是个狡猾的家伙
Watch out for Allenby. He's a slim customer.

1092
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:11,445
-对不起 -他是个聪明人
-Excuse me? -A clever man.

1093
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:14,610
狡猾的家伙，说的好
Slim customer. It's very good.

1094
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:19,442
我当然会小心他 你真的是太好心了
I'll certainly watch out for him. You're being very sympathetic.

1095
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,247
殿下，美国人也曾是殖民
Your Highness, we Americans were once a colonial people.

1096
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,807
我们当然会同情
We naturally feel sympathetic to any people...

1097
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:28,287
那些为争取自由而努力的人
...who struggle for their freedom.

1098
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:30,681
真的是太好了
Very gratifying.

1099
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:37,809
还有我的目的跟你一样 你希望世人知道你的故事
Also, my interests are the same as yours. You want your story told.

1100
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:40,281
我很需要一个这样的故事
I badly want a story to tell.

1101
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:44,286
你在胡扯了，对吧？
Ah, now you are talking turkey, are you not?

1102
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:47,804
我会派响导给你 并帮你写一封信的
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1103
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,968
在我离开这里之前…
And before l leave here...

1104
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:52,601
我得立刻离开
...which must be presently...

1105
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:56,327
我会写下一些事实跟数字给你
...I will have some facts and figures put on paper for you.

1106
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:01,363
你知道我们在破坏土耳其人的铁路
You know that we are destroying the Turkish railways.

1107
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:02,726
是的，殿下
I do, sir.

1108
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:05,844
劳伦斯少校负责这次的行动，对吧？
Major Lawrence is in charge of all this, is he?

1109
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:08,600
我的军队是由沙漠部族所组成的
My army is made up of tribes.

1110
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:11,844
部族是由族长所领导
The tribes are led by the tribal leaders.

1111
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,163
你的人民很尊重劳伦斯少校吗？
Your people do think very highly of Major Lawrence?

1112
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:18,443
没错，你说的对
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1113
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,362
班特利先生，在这个国家…
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1114
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:26,687
能够为战争带来胜利的人…
...the man who gives victory in battle is prized...

1115
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:29,525
能得到最高的尊敬
...beyond every other man.

1116
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:33,369
我现在就可以告诉你一个人…
One figure I can give you from my head...

1117
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:37,206
因为我从没忘记过
...because it never leaves my head.

1118
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:41,765
自从四个月前开始这项行动后 我们有…
Since starting this campaign four months ago, we have lost...

1119
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:45,160
三十七人受伤…
...37 wounded...

1120
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:51,048
一百五十六人死亡
...1 56 dead.

1121
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:57,361
请注意死伤人数的比例不平衡
You remark the disproportion between our dead and wounded.

1122
02:27:57,560 --> 02:27:58,891
对
Yeah.

1123
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:00,611
死者比伤者多了四倍
Four times as many.

1124
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:05,562
那是因为 我们会杀了受伤太重的人
That's because those too wounded to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1125
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:08,280
我们不会让伤者 落入土耳其人手中
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1126
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:12,406
-你是说…？ -我们不会让伤者落入敌人手中
-You mean...? -We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1127
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:16,327
在他们的眼中 我们不是士兵而是叛徒
In their eyes, we are not soldiers but rebels.

1128
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:21,003
叛徒不管是受伤还是健全 都不受日内瓦公约保护…
Rebels, wounded or whole, are not protected by the Geneva Code...

1129
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:23,129
而且被敌人残忍地虐待着
...and are treated harshly.

1130
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:24,881
有多残忍？
How harshly?

1131
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:28,090
那种情况是你想像不到的
More harshly than I hope you can imagine.

1132
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:29,921
我懂了
I see.

1133
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:33,323
我们的囚犯受到妥善照顾 直到我们…
Our own prisoners are taken care of until the British...

1134
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,366
根据公约把他们放给英国人
...can relieve us of them, according to the Code.

1135
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:41,645
-我希望你能记住这一点 -是的，先生
-I should like you to notice that. -Yes, sir.

1136
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:45,246
那是劳伦斯少校的影响吗？
Is that the influence of Major Lawrence?

1137
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,085
你为什么会那么想？
Why should you suppose?

1138
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:49,766
只是我在开罗听说…
It's just that I heard in Cairo that...

1139
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:52,440
劳伦斯少校讨厌杀人
...Major Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.

1140
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,369
事实的确如此
That is exactly so.

1141
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:58,042
对劳伦斯少校而言 仁慈是他所爱的
With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion.

1142
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:01,290
对我来说那只是一种好礼貌
With me, it is merely good manners.

1143
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:05,604
你可以判断 哪一项动机比较信得过
You may judge which motive is the more reliable.

1144
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:09,608
-好了，或许… -当然
-And now, perhaps.... -Oh, sure, sure.

1145
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:15,404
谢谢您，先生
Thank you, sir.

1146
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:17,364
你能把信写得…？
Can you manage the letter--?

1147
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:20,444
我会实践我说过的话…
I'll do everything I have said...

1148
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:24,241
只要你诚实地告诉我 你为何对…
...if you will tell me truly the nature of your interest...

1149
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:26,886
我的人民跟劳伦斯少校的事有兴趣
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1150
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:31,929
很简单，先生 我在寻找一个英雄
It's very simple, sir. I'm looking for a hero.

1151
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:34,646
没错，你看起来 不像是个浪漫的人
Indeed. You do not seem a romantic man.

1152
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:35,961
对
Oh, no.

1153
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:40,006
但我老家那些有影响力的人相信…
But influential men back home believe it's time for America...

1154
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:42,965
美国该挺身而出对抗德国
...to lend her weight to the struggle against Germany.

1155
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,202
跟土耳其
And Turkey.

1156
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:49,804
我来采访新闻 告诉我的国人这场战争…
I've been sent to find material to show our people that this war is....

1157
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:52,766
-很好玩？ -不是那样的，先生
-Enjoyable? -Hardly that, sir.

1158
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,004
是用更冒险的角度来报导它
But to show it in its more adventurous aspects.

1159
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:59,841
你在寻找一个能让 你的国家参战的人
You look for a figure who will draw your country towards war.

1160
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:03,209
好吧，对
All right. Yes.

1161
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,490
劳伦斯是你要的人
Lawrence is your man.

1162
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:46,361
停火！
Stop!

1163
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:07,410
停火！
Stop it!

1164
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:09,605
停火！

1165
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,285
快点，大伙们！
Come on, men!

1166
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:29,811
劳伦斯！
Lawrence!

1167
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:52,482
天啊！
Good God! God!

1168
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:43,681
吉米尼！我从没看过 有人这样被剑杀死
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed with a sword before.

1169
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,161
你为什么不照张相呢？
Why don't you take a picture?

1170
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:47,846
我希望我照了
Wish I had.

1171
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:54,281
你好吗？劳伦斯
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1172
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:57,567
我在里面吗？
Am I in this?

1173
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,289
你有帮他拍照吗？
Did you take his picture?

1174
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:01,760
拍了
Yeah.

1175
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:10,364
很快地你的九条命都会没了
You are using up your nine lives very quickly.

1176
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:14,928
你的同伴挺不错的
Charming company you keep.

1177
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:16,400
奥达？
Auda?

1178
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:22,240
他有点老古板，他觉得 这些东西会吸走他的灵魂
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks these things will steal his virtue.

1179
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:24,682
他觉得你是小偷
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1180
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:27,048
可以替你拍张照吗？
It's all right to take your picture?

1181
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,090
-好吧 -好
-All right. -Okay.

1182
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:30,765
走吧
Just walk.

1183
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,162
劳伦斯少校！
Major Lawrence!

1184
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:36,485
对，这才是我的宝贝
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1185
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,126
这种洗劫的行为得停止！
This looting has got to stop!

1186
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:48,685
这是习俗
It is customary.

1187
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:52,521
这是偷窃，小偷才会偷东西
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1188
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:55,007
我不会那么跟奥达说
I would not say that to Auda.

1189
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,330
-那是他们的薪水，上校 -薪水
-It is their payment, colonel. -Payment.

1190
02:35:58,520 --> 02:36:01,330
真的，英国士兵没有薪水吗？
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1191
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:05,522
-他们拿了薪水就不想回家 -他们无法自由回家
-They don't go home when being paid. -They are not free to.

1192
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:14,405
你再不会看到他们了
Well, there's another lot you've seen the last of.

1193
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:16,330
他们会回来的
They'll come back.

1194
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:20,084
他说他们会回来，会吗？
He says they'll come back. Will they?

1195
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:22,567
今年不会，劳伦斯
Not this year, Lawrence.

1196
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:27,729
听着，劳伦斯，你觉得你们 会剩下多少人？两百人吗？
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you think you'll have left? 200?

1197
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:30,730
-会更少 -那么是多少？
-Less. -Well, then?

1198
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:33,407
我说过他们会回来的
I said, they'll come back.

1199
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:35,320
你伤的很重吗？
You badly hurt?

1200
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:38,604
我根本没受伤
Not hurt at all.

1201
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:43,004
你不知道吗？ 他们只有用金子弹才杀得了我
Didn't you know? They can only kill me with a golden bullet.

1202
02:36:58,760 --> 02:37:02,606
这是给孩子的书 我得督促自己再学一次
It is for children. I have set myself to learn again.

1203
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:06,601
-你从这件事里学到什么？ -政治
-What are you learning from this? -Politics.

1204
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:11,768
你会在本国行民主政治吗？ 你会成立国会吗？
You'll be a democracy in this country? You gonna have a parliament?

1205
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:14,727
当我成立了国家 我再回答你这些问题
I will tell you that when I have a country.

1206
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:18,291
我回答得好吗？
Did I answer well?

1207
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:22,850
你回答了，但什么都没说 那就是政治
You answered without saying anything. That's politics.

1208
02:37:24,120 --> 02:37:25,770
你学的很快
You learn quickly.

1209
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:29,282
我有一个好老师
I have a good teacher.

1210
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,285
对
Yeah.

1211
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,889
-你伤得如何？ -我很好
-How's your hurt? -Fine.

1212
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:47,927
在我回到战场前 而且我非常乐意那么做
Before I return to the fleshpots, which I shall be very glad to do...

1213
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:51,169
我能直接地问你两个问题吗？
...may I put two questions to you, straight?

1214
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:54,802
我想听你直接地问一个问题
I'd be interested to hear you put a question straight.

1215
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,161
一
One.

1216
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:00,611
你觉得这些人希望从 这场战争里得到什么？
What, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war?

1217
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:03,326
他们希望获得他们的自由
They hope to gain their freedom.

1218
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:05,647
自由
Freedom.

1219
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:09,764
“他们希望获得他们的自由”
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1220
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,641
-他们受骗了 -他们会得到自由的
-There's one born every minute. -They're going to get it.

1221
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:16,647
我会让他们得到自由的
I'm going to give it to them.

1222
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:24,168
-第二个问题呢？ -我要问的是…
-The second question? -Well, I was going to ask...

1223
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:28,651
沙漠是什么地方吸引你呢？
...what is it that attracts you personally to the desert?

1224
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:32,688
它很干净
It's clean.

1225
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,045
好了
Well, now...

1226
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:40,048
那是个很棒的答案
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1227
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:42,044
我可以…
May I...

1228
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:45,206
拍一张告别照片吗？
...take one farewell picture?

1229
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:49,083
我给麦斯巴德两个灯才换到它
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1230
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:52,330
一个钟换两个灯
One clock for two lamps.

1231
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:54,040
一项很公平的交易
A fair bargain.

1232
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:56,891
公平？我是在抢劫他
Fair? l robbed him.

1233
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:09,845
垃圾
Trash.

1234
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:13,361
我得找到一些荣耀的东西
I must find something honourable.

1235
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,205
荣耀的东西？
Honourable?

1236
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:19,606
今年快过完了，布莱顿
The year is running out, Brighton.

1237
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,004
我得找到一些荣耀的东西
I must find something honourable.

1238
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,722
你现在可以炸了我的火车
Now you may blow up my train.

1239
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,729
你要做什么？
And what will you do now?

1240
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:07,528
我现在要回家 他们把我的玩具载走
Now I go home. They will carry my toys.

1241
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:10,282
他们也会载我的玩具 你懂吗？
They will carry my toys too, see?

1242
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:13,729
劳伦斯少校 今年冬天会发动攻势
Major Lawrence will campaign this winter.

1243
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,402
但你得到你想要的东西 所以要回家去，对吧？
But you got what you wanted, so you're going home, is that it?

1244
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:22,248
当然，当劳伦斯得到他 想要的东西，他会回家去的
Of course. When Lawrence has got what he wants, he will go home.

1245
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,046
当你得到你想要的东西时 你也会回家去的
When you've got what you want, you will go home.

1246
02:42:25,240 --> 02:42:26,924
不，我不会的，奥达
No, I shan't, Auda.

1247
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:29,091
那么你是个笨蛋
Then you are a fool.

1248
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:32,764
或许吧，我不是个逃兵
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1249
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:36,087
谢天谢地，布莱顿
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1250
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:39,409
当他把你变成一个呆瓜时 他也让你一脸的呆相
...that when he made you a fool, he gave you a fool's face.

1251
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:42,762
你是个无礼的混蛋
You are an impudent rascal.

1252
02:42:44,240 --> 02:42:48,609
我得走了，劳伦斯 不然我也要成为笨蛋了
I must go, Lawrence, before I soil myself with a fool's blood.

1253
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:00,724
我像是在对牛弹琴
Like talking to a brick wall.

1254
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:12,085
你现在要做什么？ 你能做什么？
So what will you do now? What can you do?

1255
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:14,444
我要往北走
I'll go north.

1256
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:17,643
那就是艾伦比想要的
That's what Allenby wants.

1257
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:21,970
艾伦比要阿拉伯军队撤到迪拉之后
Allenby wanted the Arab army behind Deraa.

1258
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:24,487
那么我会把他们领到那儿
Then that's where I'll take it.

1259
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:30,327
叫艾伦比快一点，不然在他 到耶路撒冷前我们就到迪拉了
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1260
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:31,761
对吧？
Won't we?

1261
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:05,287
火车，法拉吉
Train, Farraj.

1262
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:07,845
对，劳伦斯
Yeah, Lawrence.

1263
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:38,883
躲起来，我的朋友
Hide yourself, my friend.

1264
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:49,570
引爆器
Detonator.

1265
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:04,730
好了，再拿一个来
All right, fetch another.

1266
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:08,720
-对不起，劳伦斯，我放… -时间还很多，再拿一个来
-Pardon, Lawrence. I put-- -Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1267
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:15,565
法拉吉？
Farraj?

1268
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:28,929
-发生什么事了？ -引爆器！…
-What happened? -Detonator. A detonator!

1269
02:45:42,440 --> 02:45:44,920
他无法骑乘了
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

1270
02:45:54,440 --> 02:45:57,284
如果他们活抓他 你知道他们会如何折磨他的
If they take him alive, you know what they'll do to him.

1271
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:12,126
杜德会生你气的
Daud will be angry with you.

1272
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:15,009
帮我向他致意
Salute him for me.

1273
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,484
你现在要做什么？
What will you do now?

1274
02:46:37,960 --> 02:46:39,450
往北走
Go north.

1275
02:46:39,640 --> 02:46:41,130
只带二十个人？
With twenty?

1276
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,446
你建议我该怎么做呢？
What would you recommend me to do?

1277
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:48,162
你会如何建议呢？
What would you recommend?

1278
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:55,527
他手下的人不到十分之一
He hasn't 1/1 0 so many men, sir.

1279
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:57,569
事实上他在骗人
He's lied, in fact.

1280
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:02,641
对也不对，他没说 他有做出他根本没做的事
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have done anything he hasn't done.

1281
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:05,525
那么就有一队阿拉伯北军罗
Then there is an Arab north army.

1282
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:11,528
-不，长官，他在这一点说谎 -你知道为什么吗？
-No, sir, he has lied about that. -Any idea why?

1283
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:15,970
-我想那是他的军队 -那是费瑟王子的军队
-It's his army, I suppose. -It's Prince Feisal's army.

1284
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:19,886
你觉得他会被同化吗？哈利
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1285
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:22,850
不会的
No.

1286
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:27,566
我想如果可以的话，他会的
He would if he could, I think.

1287
02:47:29,360 --> 02:47:32,842
-就我对国家的观念不会的 -这不重要，我只是好奇
-Not my line of country. -It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1288
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:35,767
重要的是我相信它
What matters is I believed it.

1289
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:37,724
土耳其人相信它
The Turks believe it.

1290
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:41,402
他们提供两万镑在悬赏他
They are offering 20,000 pounds for him.

1291
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:45,089
天啊
Good heavens.

1292
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:49,281
-看来他活不久了 -他是个勇敢的人…
-Shouldn't say he had long to live. -Whatever else, he's a brave man--

1293
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:53,889
没错，如果他还敢带 五十个人北行，他的确很有种
Surely, surely. If he's still going north with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1294
02:47:55,080 --> 02:47:57,890
不知道他们 会不会出这么多钱来悬赏我
I wonder if they'd offer that much for me.

1295
02:47:59,560 --> 02:48:03,690
明年呢？他们还会回来吗？
What about next year? Will they still come back?

1296
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:05,922
我并不讶异
I wouldn't be surprised.

1297
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:09,761
-他们觉得他是圣徒？ -是他们或是他？
-They think he's a kind of prophet. -They do or he does?

1298
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:27,926
-我可以说句话吗？ -当然可以
-Now may I speak? -Yes.

1299
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:31,763
再失败一次 你会发现自己孤独一人
One more failure and you will find yourself alone.

1300
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:36,642
-不包括我 -不包括其他人
-I do not include myself. -I do not include the others.

1301
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:39,122
他们爱你
So say they love you.

1302
02:48:39,560 --> 02:48:42,086
更应该对他们要求低些
The more reason to be thrifty with them.

1303
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:45,409
给他们做的好的任务 但你没那么做
Give them something to do that can be done. But you, no.

1304
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:47,807
他们得移开高山 在水面上行走
They must move mountains, walk on water.

1305
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:51,249
没错
That's right. That's right.

1306
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:54,320
你凭什么知道人能做什么事？
Who are you to know what can be done?

1307
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:58,486
若我们完成你觉得可以 做到的事，我们早在阳波了
If we'd done what you thought could be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1308
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:03,489
我要他们做到的事都能做得到 你不明白，他们也明白
Whatever I ask them to do can be done. They know that if you don't.

1309
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:08,570
你认为我只是一个普通人？
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1310
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:10,451
是吗？
Do you?

1311
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:17,008
我的朋友谁要跟我走在水面上？
My friends, who will walk on water with me?

1312
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:24,843
-谁要跟我进入迪拉？ -迪拉戒备森严
-Who will come with me into Deraa? -Deraa is garrisoned.

1313
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,128
你要以二十人攻打两千人？
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1314
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:31,086
-如果有必要，我会自己去 -为什么？
-I'll go by myself if I have to. -Why?

1315
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:33,163
我告诉英国将军…
Because I told the English generals...

1316
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:37,081
当他们到耶路撒冷时 阿拉伯暴动会在迪拉
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1317
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:39,648
或许你是为了英国的将军们…
Or perhaps you are here...

1318
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:42,168
来到这里
...for the English generals.

1319
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:45,884
谁说的？
Who says this?

1320
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:47,525
传言是如此
Rumour.

1321
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:51,366
那不算是争论
That is not an argument.

1322
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,807
争论
Oh, argument.

1323
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,368
今天下午当阿拉伯人还在争论…
This afternoon I will take the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1324
02:49:57,640 --> 02:50:00,041
我要带阿拉伯暴动进入迪拉
...while the Arabs argue.

1325
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:05,129
你能在阿拉伯的村落 假扮成阿拉伯人而不被认出吗？
Can you pass for an Arab in an Arab town?

1326
02:50:05,480 --> 02:50:09,246
可以，如果你们愿意 借我一些脏衣服
Yes. If one of you would lend me some dirty clothes.

1327
02:50:18,520 --> 02:50:19,726
那太疯狂了
It's madness.

1328
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:25,009
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

1329
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:27,726
宣布我的到来的方法
Some way to announce myself.

1330
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:29,888
对他有点耐心，天啊
Be patient with him, God.

1331
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:47,569
-你不知道他们怎么看你吗？ -冷静，阿里，没人看得到我
-Do you not see how they look at you? -Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1332
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:49,085
站住！
Halt!

1333
02:50:49,280 --> 02:50:50,520
继续走
Walk on.

1334
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:52,569
-站住！ -继续走
-Halt! -Walk on.

1335
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:55,922
你跟你
You and you.

1336
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:38,166
你
You.

1337
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:56,728
你的眼珠是蓝色的
You have blue eyes.

1338
02:52:57,560 --> 02:53:01,849
-我说你的眼珠是蓝色的 -对，朋友
-I say you have blue eyes. -Yes, effendi.

1339
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:05,328
-你是瑟卡新人吗？ -对，朋友
-Are you Circassian? -Yes, effendi.

1340
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:07,804
你几岁？
How old are you?

1341
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:11,044
我二十七岁，朋友
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1342
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:13,169
我想
I think.

1343
02:53:13,400 --> 02:53:17,928
你看起来比实际年龄老 你一定经历过很多事
You look older. You have had a lot of experience.

1344
02:53:19,240 --> 02:53:21,322
那是个长得很有趣的脸
It's an interesting face.

1345
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:28,400
我被牛包围着
I am surrounded by cattle.

1346
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:32,721
他根本连有趣的脸 是什么都不知道
He wouldn't know an interesting face from a sow's belly.

1347
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:37,770
我到迪拉来三年半了
I have been is Deraa now for three and a half years.

1348
02:53:37,960 --> 02:53:42,363
就是他们把我派到月球背面布岗 我也不会觉得…
If they posted me to the dark side of the moon, I could not be more...

1349
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:44,403
孤单
...isolated.

1350
02:53:46,320 --> 02:53:48,926
你不知道我在说什么
You haven't the least idea what l'm talking about.

1351
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:50,929
对，朋友
No, effendi.

1352
02:53:53,480 --> 02:53:54,891
是吗？
Have you?

1353
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:57,411
对
No.

1354
02:53:58,080 --> 02:53:59,923
那真的是…
That would be too...

1355
02:54:00,120 --> 02:54:01,770
太幸运了
...lucky.

1356
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:28,004
你打哪弄来这个？
Where did you get that?

1357
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:34,084
-这是旧伤了，朋友 -不，这是新的
-It's old, effendi. -No, this is recent.

1358
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:38,407
-你是个逃兵 -不是的，朋友
-You are a deserter. -No, effendi.

1359
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:40,529
是，你是个逃兵
Yes, you are a deserter.

1360
02:54:41,640 --> 02:54:43,881
但是从哪个军队逃出来的呢？
But from which army?

1361
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:48,641
那不重要
Not that it matters at all.

1362
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:51,327
人不可能老是穿制服
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1363
02:55:02,840 --> 02:55:04,808
你的皮肤很漂亮
Your skin is very fair.

1364
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:24,966
打他
Beat him.

1365
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:00,931
给我！
To me!

1366
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:04,970
睡吧
Sleep.

1367
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,290
睡吧

1368
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,411
吃
Eat.

1369
02:59:27,240 --> 02:59:28,571
吃

1370
02:59:32,400 --> 02:59:35,244
你有个跟其他男人一样的身体
You have a body, like other men.

1371
02:59:43,720 --> 02:59:44,767
很好
Good.

1372
02:59:45,960 --> 02:59:47,724
那么睡吧
Then sleep.

1373
03:00:01,240 --> 03:00:02,526
好一点了吗？
Better?

1374
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:05,851
好多了，你说的对
Much better. You were right.

1375
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:08,282
休息吧，你学不乖吗？
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1376
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:11,322
我已经学到教训了
Oh, l've learned all right.

1377
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:18,809
我要走了，阿里
I'm going, Ali.

1378
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:21,968
-为什么？ -为什么？
-Why? -Why?

1379
03:00:23,280 --> 03:00:24,520
天啊
Heavens.

1380
03:00:24,800 --> 03:00:26,131
为什么？
Why?

1381
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,241
我想我已经完了
I've come to the end of myself, I suppose.

1382
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:31,482
阿拉伯叛乱呢？
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1383
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:34,889
我不是阿拉伯叛乱，阿里 我甚至不是阿拉伯人
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali. I'm not even Arab.

1384
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:38,164
你说人可以变成他想成为的人
A man can be whatever he wants. You said.

1385
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:41,444
抱歉，我以为那是真的
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1386
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:43,648
你证明了这一点
You proved it.

1387
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:46,002
听着，阿里
Look, Ali. Look.

1388
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:50,046
那是我，是什么颜色？ 那是我
That's me. What colour is it? That's me.

1389
03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:53,161
是我改不了的
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1390
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:56,011
你说人可以变成他想成为的人
A man can do whatever he wants. You said.

1391
03:00:57,800 --> 03:00:59,290
他可以…
He can...

1392
03:00:59,480 --> 03:01:02,370
但他不能随心所欲
...but he can't want what he wants.

1393
03:01:03,320 --> 03:01:06,529
这是决定他要什么的东西
This is the stuff that decides what he wants.

1394
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:13,160
你也知道吧 我想什么都告诉他们
You may as well know. I would've told them anything.

1395
03:01:13,360 --> 03:01:17,331
我想告诉他们我是谁 我想告诉他们你要去哪里
I would've told them who I am. I would've told them where you were.

1396
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:20,330
-我试着要说 -任何人都会那么做的
-I tried to. -So would any man.

1397
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:24,047
我只是个平凡人
Well, any man is what l am.

1398
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:29,045
我要回去跟艾伦比…
And l'm going back to Allenby to ask him for a job...

1399
03:01:29,320 --> 03:01:31,402
要一个平凡人的工作
...that any man can do.

1400
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:33,569
艾伦比在耶路撒冷
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1401
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:36,571
-我要做些轻松的事 -你？
-I'll make easy stages. -You?

1402
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:41,562
对，我要做些轻松的事
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1403
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:47,888
听着，阿里，我想我可以有…
Look, Ali, I think l see a way of being just...

1404
03:01:48,120 --> 03:01:49,724
一种平凡的…
...ordinarily...

1405
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:51,811
快乐
...happy.

1406
03:01:55,600 --> 03:01:57,250
我能拿走这个吗？
Can I take this?

1407
03:01:57,880 --> 03:01:59,769
它不干净喔
It is not clean.

1408
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:03,089
对，但是很温暖
No, but it's warm.

1409
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:04,771
他们呢…
And these...

1410
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:08,931
带领他们到这里来 你不在乎他们吗？
...having led them here, have you no care for them?

1411
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:15,606
你带领他们，他们是你的了 相信你的人民
You lead them. They're yours. Trust your own people.

1412
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:20,047
让我回到我的人民身边
And let me go back to mine.

1413
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:52,289
-别忘了那些五人小组 -好吧
-I say, don't forget those form fives. -All right.

1414
03:02:58,120 --> 03:02:59,963
介意我加入吗？
Mind if l join you?

1415
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:02,484
这是我的荣幸
Honoured, sir.

1416
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:08,168
-回来了真好 -我们都听说你回来了，先生
-Good to be back. -We heard you were, sir.

1417
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:11,286
-那边发生了什么事？ -哪里？
-What's doing out there? -Where?

1418
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:13,767
-阿拉伯？ -是的，先生
-Arabia? -Well, yes, sir.

1419
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:17,322
没什么，现在是淡季 这里呢？
Nothing much. Wrong time of year. What's doing here?

1420
03:03:17,600 --> 03:03:20,001
我们在安顿 我们盖了一座球场
We're settling in. We built a squash court.

1421
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:21,645
太好了
Jolly good.

1422
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:26,485
我得上去了
Well, I have to go up there.

1423
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:29,960
那是借来的 有人把我的偷走了
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1424
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:31,924
真是混蛋
Bloody wogs.

1425
03:03:33,320 --> 03:03:35,209
对啊，或许吧
Yes, probably.

1426
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:38,361
球场那件事真是个好主意
Jolly good about the squash court.

1427
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,566
他太夸张了，对吧？
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1428
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:58,086
早安
Morning.

1429
03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:00,049
-早安 -回来了真好
-Good morning, sir. -Good to be back.

1430
03:04:00,320 --> 03:04:03,369
-我相信你，先生 -不，是真的
-I'll believe you, sir. -No, really it is.

1431
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:08,011
嗨
Hello.

1432
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:11,723
早安，直走进去
Morning. You're to go right in.

1433
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:25,245
劳伦斯
Lawrence.

1434
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,571
或我该叫你劳伦斯少校？
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1435
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:31,605
长官
Sir.

1436
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:39,243
将军，我要离开了
Well, general, I will leave you.

1437
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:42,410
劳伦斯少校毫无疑问地要报告…
Major Lawrence doubtless has reports to make...

1438
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:46,480
关于我的人民跟他们的弱点…
...about my people and their weakness...

1439
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:51,527
及让英国对他们 保持利益权的必要
...and the need to keep them in the British interest.

1440
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:57,601
法国人也有利益权 我们别忘了法国人
And the French interest too. We must not forget the French.

1441
03:04:57,760 --> 03:04:59,808
我说过了并没有这样的条约限制
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1442
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:04,563
对，将军，你很勇敢地说谎 但说服力却不够
Yes, general, you have lied most bravely, but not convincingly.

1443
03:05:04,760 --> 03:05:06,762
我知道的确有条约存在
I know this treaty does exist.

1444
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,923
条约？
Treaty, sir?

1445
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:13,122
他的表演比你好，将军
He does it better than you, general.

1446
03:05:13,400 --> 03:05:16,643
当然他可以说是个阿拉伯人
But then, of course, he is almost an Arab.

1447
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:32,444
你真的不知道吗？
You really don't know?

1448
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:36,802
那么这到底是怎么一回事？
Then what the devil's this?

1449
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:41,691
是我要求调离阿拉伯的申请信 先生
It's my request for release from Arabia, sir.

1450
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:43,285
为什么？
For what reason?

1451
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:45,801
你确定你没听说过 史凯奇皮哥特条约？
You sure you haven't heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1452
03:05:45,960 --> 03:05:47,371
我没听过
No.

1453
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:51,329
-我猜想得到 -别猜了，告诉他吧
-I can guess. -Don't guess. Tell him.

1454
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:54,485
好了
Well, now....

1455
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:58,003
史凯奇先生是一名英国公仆
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

1456
03:05:58,200 --> 03:06:01,329
皮哥特先生是一名法国公仆
Monsieur Picot is a French civil servant.

1457
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:05,690
史凯奇跟皮哥特见面 他们同意在战后…
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met, and they agreed that after the war...

1458
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,322
英法该共享土耳其帝国
...France and England should share the Turkish Empire.

1459
03:06:09,600 --> 03:06:11,329
包括阿拉伯在内
Including Arabia.

1460
03:06:11,600 --> 03:06:15,685
他们签订同意书而不是和约
They signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir.

1461
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:19,009
同意书是有法律效力的
An agreement to that effect.

1462
03:06:19,680 --> 03:06:23,207
小偷之间或许还有尊严 但政客是无耻的
There may be honour among thieves, but there's none in politicians.

1463
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:26,205
我们别生气
And let's have no displays of indignation.

1464
03:06:26,520 --> 03:06:29,649
你也许还不知道 但你有怀疑
You may not have known, but you certainly had suspicions.

1465
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:33,488
如果我们是在说谎 你有一半也是在说谎
If we've told lies, you've told half-lies.

1466
03:06:33,680 --> 03:06:38,163
像我这样说谎的人 只是在隐瞒事实
And a man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth.

1467
03:06:38,360 --> 03:06:43,127
但说一半谎话的人 忘了事实是什么
But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it.

1468
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:47,002
真相是我是个普通人
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1469
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:49,881
你已经跟我说过了，戴丹
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1470
03:06:51,360 --> 03:06:53,362
我要一份普通的工作
And l want an ordinary job, sir.

1471
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:55,921
那是我辞职的原因
That's my reason for resigning.

1472
03:06:57,200 --> 03:06:58,884
是因为私人的因素
It's personal.

1473
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,247
-私人的因素？ -是的，长官
-Personal? -Yes, sir.

1474
03:07:01,560 --> 03:07:04,643
私人的因素？ 你可是一名公职军官
Personal? You're a serving officer in the field.

1475
03:07:04,880 --> 03:07:08,202
事实上你是一个 很重要的人物，你疯了吗？
And as it happens, a damned important one. Are you mad?

1476
03:07:08,520 --> 03:07:11,729
不，如果你不介意的话 我不想发疯
No, and if you don't mind, I'd rather not go mad.

1477
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:14,002
那也是我的理由
That's my reason too.

1478
03:07:14,200 --> 03:07:19,240
听着，下个月十六号 我在大马士革有个大计划
Look, I'm making my big push on Damascus the 1 6th of next month...

1479
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:21,402
你是其中的一部份
...and you are part of it.

1480
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:25,566
你明白吗？你是一个 大计划中重要的一部份！
Can you understand that? You're an important part of the big push!

1481
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:29,685
我不要成为你的大计划中的一部份！
I don't want to be part of your big push!

1482
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:32,448
那么你的阿拉伯朋友呢？
What about your Arab friends?

1483
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:36,520
我没有阿拉伯朋友！ 我不要阿拉伯朋友！
I have no Arab friends! I don't want Arab friends!

1484
03:07:36,760 --> 03:07:38,922
你到底要什么？劳伦斯
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1485
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:44,246
我说过了，我只想当个普通人
I've told you, I just want my ration of common humanity.

1486
03:07:44,560 --> 03:07:47,450
-劳伦斯 -什么？
-Lawrence. -Yes?

1487
03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:52,925
没什么，抱歉打断你们了
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1488
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:55,288
没关系，谢谢你，戴丹先生
That's all right. Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1489
03:07:55,560 --> 03:07:57,289
谢谢你
Thank you, sir.

1490
03:07:58,320 --> 03:08:00,561
我们为什么不…？
Why don't we...?

1491
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:04,963
你背上有血
There's blood on your back.

1492
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:09,323
-你要看医生吗？ -不必了
-Do you want a doctor? -No.

1493
03:08:10,480 --> 03:08:12,687
告诉我发生了什么事
Tell me what happened.

1494
03:08:17,640 --> 03:08:19,802
哎呀，那里发生了什么事？
Say, what goes on in there?

1495
03:08:20,600 --> 03:08:22,443
-没什么 -少来了！
-Nothing. -Oh, come on!

1496
03:08:22,720 --> 03:08:26,122
-真的没什么，什么事都没有 -他有麻烦了吗？
-No, really. Nothing at all. -Is the man in trouble?

1497
03:08:26,320 --> 03:08:30,291
应该如此，我们都有麻烦 生活充满了麻烦
I expect so. We all have troubles. Life's a vale of troubles.

1498
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:34,491
他有麻烦就告诉我 我得保护他
Let me know if the man's in trouble. I've got a claim in that man.

1499
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:38,167
-为什么？ -我让那孩子成了英雄
-What claim? -I've made that boy a hero.

1500
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:41,125
当战争结束后 他想做什么都可以
When the war's over, he can be anything he wants.

1501
03:08:41,320 --> 03:08:45,644
是，现在他想当别人
Yes. Well, at the moment he wants to be somebody else.

1502
03:08:46,160 --> 03:08:49,004
麻烦借过一下，好吗？
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1503
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:52,000
逃避吧，戴丹
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1504
03:08:52,280 --> 03:08:55,045
总是在逃避，不是吗？
Always walking away, aren't you?

1505
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:56,845
告诉你吧
Well, I'll tell you.

1506
03:08:57,040 --> 03:09:00,010
那里正在爆发脾气上的冲突
It's a clash of temperament that's going on in there.

1507
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:03,164
不可避免地他们有一个半疯了
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1508
03:09:03,360 --> 03:09:06,170
一个完全寡廉鲜耻
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1509
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:10,004
我相信你的名字将会家喻户晓
I believe your name will be a household word...

1510
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:14,161
而要知道谁是艾伦比 还要去战争博物馆查
...when you'd have to go to the war museum to find who Allenby was.

1511
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:17,964
你是我见过最不凡的人
You're the most extraordinary man I ever met.

1512
03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:20,050
别来烦我
Leave me alone.

1513
03:09:20,360 --> 03:09:22,840
-别来烦我 -真软弱的句子
-Leave me alone. -That's a feeble thing to say.

1514
03:09:23,080 --> 03:09:25,686
-我知道我不平凡 -我不是那个意思
-I know I'm not ordinary. -That's not what I'm saying.

1515
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:28,690
好吧，我很不凡
All right, l'm extraordinary.

1516
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:31,761
那又怎么样？
What of it?

1517
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:34,891
不是很多人都注定好要成为伟人的 劳伦斯
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.

1518
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:38,203
注定该成为伟大的人却感到害怕 那真的是太糟糕了
It's a terrible thing for a man to flunk it if he has.

1519
03:09:38,360 --> 03:09:40,522
这是你的经验谈吗？
Are you speaking from experience?

1520
03:09:40,840 --> 03:09:42,205
不是
No.

1521
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:44,203
那么是你的猜测
You're guessing, then.

1522
03:09:45,360 --> 03:09:46,725
我猜你错了
Suppose you're wrong.

1523
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:50,049
你为什么会那么说？ 我们都知道我是对的
Why suppose that? We both know I'm right.

1524
03:09:50,880 --> 03:09:53,850
-对，我说对 -毕竟…
-Yes. I said, yes. -After all--

1525
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:58,448
-十六号？ -你办得到吗？
-The 1 6th? -Can you do it?

1526
03:09:58,600 --> 03:10:00,728
我会给你很多钱
I'll give you a lot of money.

1527
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,844
-大跑呢？ -我办不到
-Artillery? -I can't.

1528
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:08,050
他们要的不是钱 他们当中的豪杰不是那么想的
They won't be coming for money, not the best of them.

1529
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:10,527
他们要的是大马士革
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1530
03:10:11,560 --> 03:10:13,608
我会给他们大马士革
Which I'm going to give them.

1531
03:10:14,360 --> 03:10:16,124
那是我想要的
That's all I want.

1532
03:10:17,200 --> 03:10:20,090
你要我们夺走土耳其人的权利
All you want is someone holding down the Turkish Right.

1533
03:10:20,320 --> 03:10:24,609
但我会给他们大马士革的 我们会抢在你们之前赶到
But I'm going to give them Damascus. We'll get there before you do.

1534
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:28,043
我们夺下它之后就要留下它
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1535
03:10:28,240 --> 03:10:30,641
叫那些政客现在烧了他们的合约
Tell the politicians to burn their paper now.

1536
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:32,211
很公平
Fair enough.

1537
03:10:32,720 --> 03:10:35,610
公平？公平与此事何干？
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1538
03:10:36,360 --> 03:10:38,283
这是会发生的
It's going to happen.

1539
03:10:38,920 --> 03:10:41,048
我要很多钱
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1540
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:43,444
所有的钱都是你的
All there is.

1541
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:45,570
不要那么多
Not that much.

1542
03:10:48,840 --> 03:10:51,605
他们的当中的豪杰不是要钱的
The best of them won't come for money.

1543
03:10:53,480 --> 03:10:54,925
他们要的是我
They'll come for me.

1544
03:11:13,360 --> 03:11:14,646
别拍照！
No pictures!

1545
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:17,241
不是要拍你，是要拍劳伦斯
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

1546
03:11:17,480 --> 03:11:21,644
他不介意拍照 他一点都不介意
He doesn't mind having his picture taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1547
03:11:21,880 --> 03:11:24,167
全世界只有一个劳伦斯
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1548
03:11:28,600 --> 03:11:31,206
劳伦斯回来后 你跟他见过面吗？
Have you met Major Lawrence since he's come back?

1549
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:32,766
见过
Yes.

1550
03:11:32,960 --> 03:11:35,327
-他变了，对吗？ -没有
-Changed, hasn't he? -No.

1551
03:11:35,480 --> 03:11:38,404
我说他变了 他变成一个不一样的人了
Oh, l'd say he had. Different man, I'd say.

1552
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:46,846
那个土耳其将军在迪拉对他做了什么？
What did that Turkish general do to him in Deraa?

1553
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:52,321
他在离开迪拉后还是一样 他只是谦卑了
He was the same man after Deraa. The same man, humbled.

1554
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,571
英国人在耶路撒冷对他做了什么？
What did the English general do to him in Jerusalem?

1555
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:58,524
考倒我了，去问劳伦斯吧
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1556
03:11:58,720 --> 03:12:00,688
-我问过了 -他怎么说？
-I did. -What did he say?

1557
03:12:00,920 --> 03:12:02,524
他大笑
He laughed.

1558
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,651
他要我把哈利斯人叫来
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1559
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:07,725
他还付我钱
He offered me money.

1560
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:09,570
你拿了吗？
Did you take it?

1561
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:13,011
没有，但很多人拿了
No. But many did.

1562
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:53,769
-这是什么？ -这是我的保镖
-What is this? -This is my bodyguard.

1563
03:12:54,480 --> 03:12:57,131
这里每个人的人头都是有价格的
There is not a man without a price on his head.

1564
03:12:57,400 --> 03:13:01,041
-我的人头也有价格 -但他们是杀手
-There's a price on my head too. -But these are murderers.

1565
03:13:01,240 --> 03:13:03,242
酋长会吊死这些人的
The sheiks will hang these men.

1566
03:13:03,480 --> 03:13:05,244
他们是我的人
These men are mine.

1567
03:13:05,760 --> 03:13:10,084
劳伦斯，他们不了解阿拉伯叛乱
Lawrence, these things know nothing of the Arab revolt.

1568
03:13:10,400 --> 03:13:13,882
-你，艾拉波的盖坦 -长官？
-You, Ghitan of Aleppo. -Sherif?

1569
03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:17,084
-我们要往哪里去啊？ -大马士革，长官
-Where do we ride? -Damascus, sherif.

1570
03:13:17,280 --> 03:13:19,203
对，但为什么？
Aye, but for what?

1571
03:13:19,440 --> 03:13:21,602
沙利夫，为了劳伦斯
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1572
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:28,042
-你买下了这些东西 -我买下这里一半的人，阿里
-You have bought these things. -I bought half the men here, Ali.

1573
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:31,045
那不一样，他们不是普通人
That is different. These are not ordinary men.

1574
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:34,284
我不要普通人，走吧！
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1575
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:40,123
大马士革！
Damascus!

1576
03:13:40,320 --> 03:13:42,448
大马士革！…
Damascus! Damascus!

1577
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:45,723
大马士革！…

1578
03:14:19,600 --> 03:14:23,161
各位，骑兵队通过?兹瑞尔跟迪拉了
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1579
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:27,081
这真的是非常好，轮到你们了
Very good, by the way. Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1580
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:30,966
如果敌人撤退 我们知道他们会撤退的…
If the enemy's retreating in any order, which we'll assume--

1581
03:14:31,120 --> 03:14:32,167
当然
Certainly.

1582
03:14:32,320 --> 03:14:34,084
他不会离麦拉德太远
He can't be far from Mallud...

1583
03:14:34,720 --> 03:14:39,009
所以我应该 在明天九点前能看到他
...in which case I can have him within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1584
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:41,282
太棒了，菲立普
Splendid. Philip.

1585
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:44,365
这是现阶段最后的步兵支援部队
These are the last infantry supports going up now.

1586
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:48,167
但星期三燧发枪团会到麦拉德
But Mallud, we could have the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1587
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:52,322
现在那样就够了，重要的是枪
That'll do for now. The guns are what matter.

1588
03:14:52,480 --> 03:14:53,720
有问题吗？
Any questions?

1589
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:58,330
这只阿拉伯军队在右边 它是什么组成的？
This Arab army on the right, sir, what's it consist of?

1590
03:14:58,800 --> 03:15:01,041
非正式的骑兵队 大约有两千人
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1591
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:03,123
他们现在在哪里？
Where are they now?

1592
03:15:03,800 --> 03:15:08,681
-跟他们在一起的人才知道 -那么去找他们，我要知道
-Can only know by being with them. -Then get with them. I want to know.

1593
03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:11,327
痛击他们，查利
Pound them, Charley.

1594
03:15:11,920 --> 03:15:13,331
痛击他们
Pound them.

1595
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:26,724
愿主保佑躺在那下面的人
God help the men who lie under that.

1596
03:15:26,920 --> 03:15:28,570
他们是土耳其人
They're Turks.

1597
03:15:28,760 --> 03:15:30,444
愿主保佑他们
God help them.

1598
03:16:13,160 --> 03:16:16,926
他简直是失去控制
Well, he's got the bit between his teeth all right.

1599
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:18,486
他很傲慢吗？
Cocky?

1600
03:16:18,680 --> 03:16:20,444
不光只是傲慢而已
More than cocky, sir.

1601
03:16:20,720 --> 03:16:24,088
他简直是失去控制
He's got the bit between his teeth all right.

1602
03:16:24,280 --> 03:16:27,762
我告诉你 我想他会比我们早到大马士革
I tell you, sir, I think he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1603
03:16:28,440 --> 03:16:30,283
-除非… -除非？
-Unless.... -Unless?

1604
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:34,331
在?兹瑞尔外 有一队土耳其人挡在他前面
Well, there's a Turkish column in front of him, out of Mazril.

1605
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:37,570
-?兹瑞尔有多少土耳其军队？ -有一旅
-What do the Turks have in Mazril? -A brigade, sir.

1606
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:42,807
不知道他们现在在哪里
I wonder where they are now.

1607
03:18:24,840 --> 03:18:26,001
不准有囚犯
No prisoners.

1608
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:31,602
大马士革，劳伦斯
Damascus, Lawrence.

1609
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:44,364
劳伦斯，别这样
Lawrence, not this.

1610
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:49,085
来吧，大马士革，劳伦斯
Go round. Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1611
03:18:49,840 --> 03:18:51,444
通通杀光
No prisoners.

1612
03:19:01,560 --> 03:19:03,164
这以前是塔拉尔人的村落
This was Talaal's village.

1613
03:19:07,400 --> 03:19:09,402
塔拉尔人！
Talaal!

1614
03:19:19,400 --> 03:19:20,606
塔拉尔人！

1615
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:31,682
通通杀光！
No prisoners!

1616
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:33,246
通通杀光！

1617
03:19:45,160 --> 03:19:46,446
天啊
God.

1618
03:19:50,200 --> 03:19:51,531
天啊

1619
03:19:53,440 --> 03:19:54,805
天啊！
God!

1620
03:22:12,120 --> 03:22:15,283
够了，叫他们住手！
Enough. Enough! Make them stop!

1621
03:23:52,680 --> 03:23:53,886
少校！
Major!

1622
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:56,244
劳伦斯少校！
Major Lawrence!

1623
03:24:01,880 --> 03:24:03,530
老天爷啊
Jesus wept.

1624
03:24:19,080 --> 03:24:20,366
老天爷啊

1625
03:24:22,240 --> 03:24:24,288
那令你惊讶吗？班特利先生
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1626
03:24:24,920 --> 03:24:27,730
你知道阿拉伯人是一只野蛮民族
Surely you know the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1627
03:24:27,920 --> 03:24:29,763
野蛮又残忍
Barbarous and cruel.

1628
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:32,489
除了他们还会是谁？
Who but they?

1629
03:24:32,880 --> 03:24:34,245
除了他们还会是谁？

1630
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:38,927
你这个混蛋
Oh, you rotten man.

1631
03:24:39,960 --> 03:24:44,409
来吧，我帮你这个混蛋拍张照
Here, let me take your rotten bloody picture.

1632
03:24:46,480 --> 03:24:48,608
给那个该死的报纸
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1633
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:18,607
这是昨晚在大马士革割下来的 劳伦斯
These were cut last night, Lawrence, in Damascus.

1634
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:20,729
大马士革！
Damascus!

1635
03:25:20,920 --> 03:25:22,809
把它们拿去给阿里长官
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1636
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:24,445
告诉他
Tell him.

1637
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:27,169
提醒他
Remind him.

1638
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:31,129
-艾伦比在大马士革吗？ -他在附近
-Is Allenby in Damascus? -Near.

1639
03:25:31,960 --> 03:25:34,247
告诉阿里长官
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1640
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:37,323
他们还没熟呢
They are not ripe.

1641
03:25:43,280 --> 03:25:45,328
将军万岁！
General salute!

1642
03:25:45,520 --> 03:25:50,208
举枪！
Present arms!

1643
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:04,003
枪放下！
Port arms!

1644
03:26:06,800 --> 03:26:08,689
劳伦斯在背后搞鬼，长官
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1645
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:11,770
全镇贴满了阿拉伯旗帜
The whole town is plastered with the Arab flag.

1646
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:19,889
-那是什么时候的事？ -已经一天一夜，长官
-When? -A day and a night, sir.

1647
03:26:20,080 --> 03:26:22,003
他们来这里一天一夜了
They've been here a day and a night.

1648
03:26:22,200 --> 03:26:24,726
他们占据了这个小镇 他们做到了
They've occupied the town. They've done it.

1649
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:28,891
他将总部设在镇公所
He's set up his own headquarters in the town hall.

1650
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:31,609
除了镇公所外还占了什么？
What else beside the town hall?

1651
03:26:31,880 --> 03:26:34,724
电信局，邮局，发电厂…
Telephone exchange, post office, powerhouse...

1652
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,401
医院，火车站 什么都占了，长官
...hospitals, fire station. Everything, sir.

1653
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:40,570
他们自称是阿拉伯国家议会
They call themselves the Arab National Council...

1654
03:26:40,720 --> 03:26:42,404
他们在镇公所里
...and they're in the town hall.

1655
03:26:42,680 --> 03:26:45,570
他们是你的问题了，哈利
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1656
03:26:47,240 --> 03:26:48,730
我们该怎么办？
What should we do about it?

1657
03:26:48,920 --> 03:26:51,366
尽快把他们弄出那里
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1658
03:26:52,240 --> 03:26:54,083
你觉得呢？戴丹
How about that, Dryden?

1659
03:26:55,880 --> 03:26:58,565
除非你想引起全面的抗争
Not unless you want a full-scale rising.

1660
03:26:59,360 --> 03:27:02,409
-那么要怎么做呢？ -费瑟何时会到大马士革？
-What, then? -When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1661
03:27:02,560 --> 03:27:04,642
他搭专用的火车，两天内会到
By special train in two days' time.

1662
03:27:04,920 --> 03:27:06,206
两天
Two days.

1663
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:09,762
最多两天，超过了 我无法再拖住他
Two days is what you asked for. I can't keep him out any longer.

1664
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:12,088
-那不够吗？ -够了
-Isn't it enough? -Yes.

1665
03:27:12,240 --> 03:27:15,722
-我想够了 -我们不能什么都不做
-Ample, l should think. -We can't just do nothing.

1666
03:27:15,920 --> 03:27:19,606
为什么？通常那是最好的方法 拿点东西来给我们喝，崔西
Why not? It's usually best. Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1667
03:27:19,840 --> 03:27:24,084
崔西，没有进一步的命令 军队们都紮营不准离开
And Tracey, all troops to remain quartered until further orders.

1668
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:26,130
技术单位也一样吗？
Does that apply to technical units?

1669
03:27:26,400 --> 03:27:28,482
特别是技术单位
Technical units particularly.

1670
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:30,125
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1671
03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:32,130
医药单位也一样吗？长官
Medicals too, sir?

1672
03:27:32,360 --> 03:27:34,567
恐怕是的，哈利
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1673
03:27:34,920 --> 03:27:36,604
医药单位也一样
Medicals too.

1674
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:18,525
这里的人…
We here...

1675
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:21,650
不是哈利斯人或哈威塔特人
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1676
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:25,003
也不是其他部族的人
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1677
03:28:25,320 --> 03:28:28,802
我们是费瑟王子 领导的阿拉伯议会的阿拉伯人
...of the Arab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.

1678
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:31,048
他侮辱我
He insulted me.

1679
03:28:32,160 --> 03:28:36,290
阿里长官说 电话现在属于哈威塔特人
Sherif Ali said that the telephones are in the care of the Howeitat...

1680
03:28:36,520 --> 03:28:39,364
它们现在都不通，这是真的
...and they have ceased to work. And this is true.

1681
03:28:39,840 --> 03:28:43,561
电话不通是因为没电
They will not work because they are given no electricity.

1682
03:28:43,800 --> 03:28:47,361
电属于哈利斯人
The electricity is in the care of the Harith.

1683
03:28:49,800 --> 03:28:52,167
你一答话，就会血流成河
If you answer, there will be bloodshed.

1684
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:56,522
你要跟我谈血流成河？
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1685
03:28:59,240 --> 03:29:03,211
我请求奥达阿布塔耶的原谅
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1686
03:29:03,440 --> 03:29:05,010
诚心的求吗？
Humbly?

1687
03:29:05,160 --> 03:29:06,525
诚心的求吗？哈利斯
Humbly, Harith?

1688
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:08,842
是的，诚心的求
Yes, humbly.

1689
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:11,328
这倒是新把戏
This is a new trick.

1690
03:29:12,320 --> 03:29:14,004
为什么没电？
Why is there no electricity?

1691
03:29:14,960 --> 03:29:17,725
我去过发电厂了，劳伦斯
I have been to that electrical house, Lawrence.

1692
03:29:17,960 --> 03:29:20,850
那里有三部大机器
There are three large machines.

1693
03:29:21,040 --> 03:29:23,407
他是说发电机！
He means generators!

1694
03:29:23,880 --> 03:29:25,041
所以呢？
So.

1695
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:27,249
有一部在燃烧
One of them is burning.

1696
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:30,563
所有机器都是这样
They are of an incredible size, but helpless.

1697
03:29:30,880 --> 03:29:33,611
所有机器都是这样
It is so of all machines.

1698
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:37,845
由它们烧吧，电话有什么作用？
Let them burn. What need of telephones?

1699
03:29:40,520 --> 03:29:43,683
-当然有用 -那么我们需要英国工程师
-The need is absolute. -Then we need English engineers.

1700
03:29:43,920 --> 03:29:47,561
不，把英国工程师带进来 英国政府也会跟着来
No. Take English engineers and you take English government.

1701
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:49,086
带…
Take--

1702
03:29:53,200 --> 03:29:54,406
失火了
Fire has broken out.

1703
03:29:54,640 --> 03:29:56,210
-在哪里？ -金西比区
-Where? -The Jinsibi district.

1704
03:29:56,400 --> 03:29:59,290
-在那一区不重要 -火势会扩散的！
-It is not a district that matters. -It will spread!

1705
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:01,250
那么叫消防队啊！
Then use the fire brigade!

1706
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:04,450
我们试过了，但水不够强
We have tried, but there is no force in the water.

1707
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:06,130
那你们得去提水
Then you must carry it.

1708
03:30:06,440 --> 03:30:10,764
-鲁阿拉人不提水的 -他们会做什么事？
-The Ruala do not carry water. -What else are they good for?

1709
03:30:23,080 --> 03:30:26,607
我们今天下午才接受陈情
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1710
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:31,169
今天下午！
This afternoon!

1711
03:30:54,920 --> 03:30:58,925
-战后我要面对这些事 -我们真的该想个办法啊
-I'll take this up after the war. -Surely we should do something, sir.

1712
03:30:59,160 --> 03:31:03,131
-这是老人的运动了 -你是老人吗？
-It's an old man's sport. -Are you an old man, sir?

1713
03:31:03,320 --> 03:31:06,210
我只能说责任真的很重大
All I can say is, sir, it's a heavy responsibility.

1714
03:31:07,640 --> 03:31:09,005
对不起
Sorry, sir.

1715
03:31:11,200 --> 03:31:12,884
或许是灯泡的问题
Maybe it's the bulb.

1716
03:31:17,600 --> 03:31:18,726
不是的
No, sir.

1717
03:31:19,160 --> 03:31:20,844
是电力的问题
It's the power.

1718
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:37,411
他们要离开了
They're leaving.

1719
03:31:38,120 --> 03:31:39,804
那么就这样了
That's it, then.

1720
03:31:40,320 --> 03:31:42,402
他们这些乞丐长得不错，对吧？
Marvellous-looking beggars, aren't they?

1721
03:32:03,640 --> 03:32:06,530
算了吧，劳伦斯，跟我来
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1722
03:32:06,760 --> 03:32:08,762
-去哪里？ -回去
-Come where? -Back.

1723
03:32:13,240 --> 03:32:15,447
我了解你的心
I know your heart.

1724
03:32:23,880 --> 03:32:25,530
那是什么？
What is it?

1725
03:32:26,520 --> 03:32:28,204
是这个吗？
Is it this?

1726
03:32:30,920 --> 03:32:34,049
我说过了，这没什么
I tell you, this is nothing.

1727
03:32:47,200 --> 03:32:48,884
那是血吗？
Is it the blood?

1728
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:52,763
在沙漠里流干的血 比你想像中还多
The desert has dried up more blood than you could think of.

1729
03:32:54,320 --> 03:32:58,689
我祈祷再也不必去沙漠
I pray that I may never see the desert again.

1730
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:01,091
听我说，上帝
Hear me, God.

1731
03:33:02,760 --> 03:33:06,606
你会来的 沙漠是你唯一栖身之处
You will come. There is only the desert for you.

1732
03:33:23,440 --> 03:33:24,771
你呢？
What about you?

1733
03:33:25,760 --> 03:33:29,321
不，我要待在这里学习政治
No, I shall stay here and learn politics.

1734
03:33:31,840 --> 03:33:33,251
一种很低等的职业
A very low occupation.

1735
03:33:33,760 --> 03:33:36,809
我在遇见你时 根本没想过要这样
I had not thought of it when I met you.

1736
03:33:45,760 --> 03:33:48,650
你非常努力地 将大马士革交给我们
You have tried very hard to give us Damascus.

1737
03:33:48,840 --> 03:33:50,763
那是我来这里的原因
It's what I came for.

1738
03:33:54,280 --> 03:33:55,520
那么…
And then...

1739
03:33:57,960 --> 03:33:59,325
那是件伟大的事
...it would be something.

1740
03:33:59,520 --> 03:34:00,806
对
Yes.

1741
03:34:01,440 --> 03:34:02,680
很伟大
Much.

1742
03:34:21,680 --> 03:34:24,160
-他是你的朋友吗？ -把你的手拿开
-He is your friend? -Take your hand away.

1743
03:34:24,360 --> 03:34:25,646
-你爱他 -我怕他
-You love him. -I fear him.

1744
03:34:25,840 --> 03:34:27,683
那你为什么哭？
Then why do you weep?

1745
03:34:28,040 --> 03:34:30,202
如果我怕他，也那么爱他…
If I fear him, who love him...

1746
03:34:30,360 --> 03:34:33,330
就知道他有多怕自己 多么的痛恨自己的了？
...how must he fear himself, who hates himself?

1747
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:36,843
把你的手拿开，哈威塔特人！
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1748
03:34:39,200 --> 03:34:42,522
原来你还不是一个完全的政客
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1749
03:34:42,720 --> 03:34:43,801
还不是
Not yet.

1750
03:34:44,040 --> 03:34:48,364
现在有很多新把戏 而我是一只老狗了
Well, these are new tricks, and I am an old dog.

1751
03:34:48,920 --> 03:34:50,843
谢谢阿拉
And Allah be thanked.

1752
03:34:51,320 --> 03:34:52,731
我会告诉你…
I'll tell thee what...

1753
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:56,368
当一个阿拉伯人 比你想像中还难，哈利斯
...being an Arab will be thornier than you suppose, Harith.

1754
03:35:17,840 --> 03:35:21,128
我一生没看过这种事
In all my years, I've never seen anything like it.

1755
03:35:21,400 --> 03:35:24,244
这是阿拉伯议会的管辖范围？
It comes within the jurisdiction of the Arab Council.

1756
03:35:24,440 --> 03:35:28,843
在这种情况下 我想我该立刻接手
Under the circumstances, I think I must take over. Immediately.

1757
03:35:29,080 --> 03:35:32,084
毕竟在任何一种情况下 你都该服从命令
Under any circumstances at all, you must obey your orders.

1758
03:35:32,360 --> 03:35:33,930
不，长官，我不会的
No, sir, I will not.

1759
03:35:34,880 --> 03:35:36,484
控制一下你自己
Control yourself.

1760
03:35:36,960 --> 03:35:40,089
到镇公所那边 去看看他们说了什么
Now, go over to the town hall and see what they say.

1761
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:43,361
市立医院那边已经尽力了
We did what we could in the civic hospitals.

1762
03:35:43,560 --> 03:35:46,404
但你忘了土耳其军事医院
But you forgot the Turkish Military Hospital.

1763
03:35:46,760 --> 03:35:51,243
那里有六百个床位 有约两千名的土耳其伤患
It has 600 beds. There are about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1764
03:35:51,880 --> 03:35:56,488
他们都是你宝贝的阿拉伯议会的责任
All of whom are the responsibility of your precious Arab Council.

1765
03:36:03,240 --> 03:36:04,685
情形是如何呢？
What's it like?

1766
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:23,568
这太过份了！
This is outrageous!

1767
03:37:24,680 --> 03:37:26,569
太过份了！
Outrageous!

1768
03:37:29,840 --> 03:37:31,524
太过份了！

1769
03:37:32,680 --> 03:37:34,887
你这个王八蛋！
You filthy little wog!

1770
03:37:45,400 --> 03:37:49,485
“我的朋友劳伦斯” 如果我可以这么叫他的话
My friend Lawrence, if I may call him that.

1771
03:37:49,720 --> 03:37:52,200
“我的朋友劳伦斯”
"My friend Lawrence."

1772
03:37:52,400 --> 03:37:57,042
多少人会宣称 他们有权那么说呢？太光荣了
How many men will claim the right to use that phrase? How proudly.

1773
03:37:57,240 --> 03:37:59,925
他期盼着祖国的绿地
He longs for the greenness of his native land.

1774
03:38:00,120 --> 03:38:05,251
他渴望在苏利的葛德式房屋，对吧？
He pines for the Gothic cottages of Surrey, is it not?

1775
03:38:05,480 --> 03:38:09,087
他已经在想像他钓着鳟鱼
Already in imagination, he catches trout...

1776
03:38:09,360 --> 03:38:12,887
从事英国绅士的所有活动
...and all the activities of the English gentleman.

1777
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:16,607
你说的人是我 不是劳伦斯上校
That's me you're describing, sir, not Colonel Lawrence.

1778
03:38:17,520 --> 03:38:19,727
你升上上校了
You're promoted colonel.

1779
03:38:19,920 --> 03:38:22,400
是，为什么？
Yes. What for?

1780
03:38:22,600 --> 03:38:25,763
接受这荣誉吧，上校 表现出一点热忱来
Take the honour, colonel. Be a little kind.

1781
03:38:26,000 --> 03:38:30,085
身为上校，在船坞那边 你会有栋小木屋
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin to yourself on the boat home.

1782
03:38:30,720 --> 03:38:33,007
谢谢你
Then, thank you.

1783
03:38:37,240 --> 03:38:38,446
那么…
Well, then...

1784
03:38:39,080 --> 03:38:40,127
愿上帝保佑你
...Godspeed.

1785
03:38:40,600 --> 03:38:44,525
这里不需要战士了
There's nothing further here for a warrior.

1786
03:38:44,760 --> 03:38:48,924
我们在讨价还价 那是老头子的工作
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1787
03:38:49,120 --> 03:38:51,441
年青人制造战争 战争的本质…
Young men make wars, and the virtues of war...

1788
03:38:51,600 --> 03:38:53,523
就是年轻人的本质
...are the virtues of young men.

1789
03:38:53,800 --> 03:38:57,247
未来的勇气跟希望
Courage and hope for the future.

1790
03:38:57,440 --> 03:39:00,125
老人则维持和平
Then old men make the peace.

1791
03:39:01,240 --> 03:39:04,130
和平的罪行是老人的罪行
And the vices of peace are the vices of old men.

1792
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:06,806
不信任跟戒心
Mistrust and caution.

1793
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:09,603
一定是这样的
It must be so.

1794
03:39:26,000 --> 03:39:30,608
我欠你的东西多到数不清
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1795
03:39:40,320 --> 03:39:44,006
发电厂，电信局，这些我都认输
The powerhouse, the telephone exchange, these I concede.

1796
03:39:44,280 --> 03:39:46,009
我得留住水厂
The pumping plant I must retain.

1797
03:39:46,200 --> 03:39:48,806
如果你留住了它 那么就无水可用了
If you retain it, there will be no water.

1798
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:52,721
-我很希望你们能够帮忙 -那么你得扯下你的旗帜
-I shall be glad of assistance. -Then you must bring down your flag.

1799
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:56,846
我不会的，若你手下要那么做 我的手下会反抗的
I shall not, and if your men attempt it, my men will resist it.

1800
03:39:57,160 --> 03:39:58,810
-你有手下吗？ -我的手下够打败你了
-Have you men? -Enough for that.

1801
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,401
这件事可以造成了可怕的事件
It's a thing that makes an ugly incident.

1802
03:40:01,720 --> 03:40:03,609
我相信你的政府…
I'm sure your government...

1803
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:07,686
不希望在和平会议上 以侵略者的身份出现
...does not wish to appear at the peace conference as an aggressor.

1804
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:11,490
喂！
I say!

1805
03:40:12,880 --> 03:40:14,848
是劳伦斯，对吧？
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1806
03:40:17,160 --> 03:40:19,367
我能跟您握个手吗？
May I shake your hand, sir?

1807
03:40:20,560 --> 03:40:23,166
我只是想跟别人吹嘘一下而已
Just want to be able to say I'd done it, sir.

1808
03:40:26,760 --> 03:40:29,001
我们以前不认识吧？
Haven't we met before?

1809
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:30,850
我想是不认识
Don't think so, sir.

1810
03:40:31,040 --> 03:40:33,771
对，不然我会记得的
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1811
03:40:39,000 --> 03:40:43,210
大家都知道阿拉伯议会 是因我之名而得到权力
It is widely known the Arab Council took power in my name.

1812
03:40:43,400 --> 03:40:45,402
他们没有权力，那是错觉
They have no power. lt's illusory.

1813
03:40:45,640 --> 03:40:48,086
错觉有时会很有力的
Illusions can be very powerful.

1814
03:40:48,440 --> 03:40:50,090
特别是…
Particularly...

1815
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:53,566
当它们采取这样的模式
...when they take this form.

1816
03:40:55,760 --> 03:40:58,764
全世界都很喜欢…
The world is delighted at the picture of Damascus...

1817
03:40:58,960 --> 03:41:00,928
被阿拉伯军队 解放大马士革的照片
...liberated by the Arab army.

1818
03:41:01,440 --> 03:41:04,569
我得提醒你，那次行动 是由一位英国军官所领导
Led, may I remind you, by a British-serving officer.

1819
03:41:05,080 --> 03:41:10,086
对，劳伦斯 像是一把刀的两面利刃
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence is a sword with two edges.

1820
03:41:10,400 --> 03:41:13,449
我们都很高兴除掉他了，对吧？
We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?

1821
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:19,281
我还以为我是个狠心人
I thought l was a hard man, sir.

1822
03:41:20,120 --> 03:41:22,407
你只是一个将军
You are merely a general.

1823
03:41:24,920 --> 03:41:26,445
我该当个国王的
I must be a king.

1824
03:41:29,440 --> 03:41:31,329
对不起
Excuse me, sir.

1825
03:41:45,960 --> 03:41:47,246
什么？
Well?

1826
03:41:48,120 --> 03:41:49,531
那个…
Well...

1827
03:41:49,960 --> 03:41:52,850
看来我们将会有一个 插上了阿拉伯旗帜的…
...it seems we're to have a British waterworks...

1828
03:41:53,080 --> 03:41:55,321
英国水利局
...with an Arab flag on it.

1829
03:41:55,520 --> 03:41:57,488
你觉得值得吗？
Do you think it was worth it?

1830
03:41:57,640 --> 03:42:00,325
那不关我的事 谢天谢地，我是个士兵
Not my business. Thank God I'm a soldier.

1831
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:01,801
是的
Yes, sir.

1832
03:42:02,120 --> 03:42:03,724
你一直都是那么说
So you keep saying.

1833
03:42:03,920 --> 03:42:05,524
我猜…
You, I suspect...

1834
03:42:06,040 --> 03:42:09,965
你是这个大和解的主要推手
...are chief architect of this compromise.

1835
03:42:10,360 --> 03:42:13,489
-你觉得呢？ -我吗？殿下
-What do you think? -Me, Your Highness?

1836
03:42:14,160 --> 03:42:18,449
整体来说 我但愿能留在唐布利吉水井区
On the whole, I wish I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1837
03:42:56,480 --> 03:42:59,529
那么，先生，回家去吧
Well, sir. Going home.

1838
03:43:01,880 --> 03:43:03,530
回家吧，先生
Home, sir.
