我敢说连这里总部的人 都不知道这件事

I'm going for a powwow with the general.
我要去跟将军谈一谈

I'm not asking as your superior, but as the secretary of this mess.
我不是以长官的身份问你 而是以休息室负责人身份在问你

We don't want chaps in here who should be on duty.

It's an intrigue, Dryden.

对指挥官的命令不屑一顾 而且还不受到惩罚

It doesn't sound as though he'd be any great loss, sir.
听起来没有他不是任何大损失

75
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,940
Don't try that, Dryden. There's a principle involved.

He's of no use here in Cairo.
他待在开罗一点用处都没有

He might be in Arabia. He knows his stuff, sir.

By God, I should hope not.
天啊，我希望他不会那么做

86
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,570
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like its own man on the spot to...

任何花在贝都因人身上的时间 都是浪费了的时间

They're a nation of sheep- stealers.

92
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,660
They did attack Medina.

And the Turks made mincemeat of them.

We don't know that.

95
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,500
We know that they didn't take it. A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.
我们知道他们没接受 那没什么，只是段小插曲

96
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,180

如果你想听我的意见 我觉得这儿根本是个小插曲

The real war's being fought against Germans, not Turks.
真正的战争敌人是德国人 不是土耳其人

98
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,880
Not here, but on the Western front in the trenches.

Your Bedouin Army, or whatever it calls itself...
你的贝都因军队 不管他们是如何称呼自己

100
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,380
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.
他们只不过是一段小插曲中的小配角

101
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,250
Big things have small beginnings, sir.
伟大的事都是 从很小的开端开始的，长官

阿拉伯局希望阿拉伯发生大事吗？

长官，局里认为 现在的工作是要打胜仗

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

- It's my manner. - Your what?
- 是我的态度 - 你的什么？

111
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,860
My manner. It looks insubordinate, but it isn't.
长官，我的态度看来像是抗命 但事实上却不然

112
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,090
I can't make out whether you're bad- mannered or just half- witted.
我弄不清楚 你是态度恶劣或是愚蠢

113
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,330
- I have the same problem, sir. - Shut up.
- 我也有相同的问题，长官 - 闭嘴

阿拉伯局认为你在阿拉伯 应该会派上用场了

115
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,830
Why, I can't imagine.

116
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,510
You can't perform your present duties properly.
你无法完成你现在的任务

"I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great state from a little city."
“我不会拉提琴，但我能让一个 小城市变成一个伟大的国家”

118
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,110
- What? - Themistocles, sir.
- 什么？ - 那是希米斯特克拉斯的话

119
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,950
- A Greek philosopher. - I know you've been well- educated.
- 他是希腊的哲学家 - 我知道你受过高深的教育

120
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,450
It says so in your dossier.
你的档案上是那么说的

121

You're the kind of creature I can't stand, Lawrence.

The convoy will be in Port Said tomorrow night.

- Is that certain? - Yes, sir.

在他那么做之前，长官 我会说那是不可能的

Why should you suppose?
