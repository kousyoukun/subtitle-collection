1
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,793
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,150
Did you know him well?

3
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,993
I knew him.

4
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
Well, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,271
But did he really deserve...

6
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,789
...a place in here?.

7
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,592
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,831
What, more words?.

9
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,511
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,395
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,399
Yes, sdir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,034
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,231
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,193
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,079
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,717
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,029
Thank you.

18
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,910
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,032
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,555
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,919
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,435
-He was a great man.
-Did you know him?

23
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,711
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,394
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,278
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,950
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,318
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,876
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,115
That's right.

30
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,590
We are not happy in it.

31
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,679
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,310
-Then you're a big noble fellow.
-That's right.

33
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,514
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,269
-Here you are, tosh.
-Thanks.

35
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,437
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,275
-Is it there?.
-Of course.

37
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,118
Headlines.

38
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,837
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the T.imes.

39
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,837
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,475
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,429
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,996
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes.

43
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,475
-Flimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

44
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,836
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesdh and blood.

45
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,833
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,951
And you're balmy!.

47
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,998
-It damn well hurts!.
-Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,112
What's the trick, then?

49
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,399
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,592
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,196
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,115
-He's balmy.
-He's all right.

53
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,553
Lawrence.

54
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,554
Yes?

55
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,597
You're supposed to be....

56
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,389
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?.

57
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,275
Always.

58
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,710
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,389
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,556
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,275
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,915
We don't want chaps in here
who sdhould be on duty.

63
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,639
Where are you going?

64
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,391
I musdt say, Lawrence!.

65
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,433
-Sorry.
-You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,076
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,749
Sorry.

68
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,591
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,036
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,755
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,271
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

72
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,911
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,633
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,797
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,157
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,919
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,271
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who'sd a soldier.

78
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,273
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,118
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,437
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,636
...giving military advice.

82
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,796
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,551
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to....

84
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,789
To what?

85
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,514
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,793
I'll tell you, it's my consdidered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,833
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,469
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,592
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,155
And the Turksd made mincemeat
of them.

91
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,719
We don't know that.

92
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,472
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sdideshow.

93
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,153
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,751
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,833
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,508
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itsdelf...

97
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,319
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,154
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,632
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,356
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?.

101
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,509
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,390
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,350
-Lawrence, sir.
-Send him in.

104
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,429
Good morning, sir.

105
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,159
Salute.

106
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,716
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,717
-It's my manner.
-Your what?

108
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,798
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,034
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,233
-I have the same problem, sir.
-Shut up.

111
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,870
The Arab Bureau thinksd you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,798
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,474
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,598
"l cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,075
-What?.
-Themisdtocles, sir.

116
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,909
-A Greek philosopher.
-I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,395
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,752
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,190
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,598
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,230
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!.

122
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,593
Yes, what is it?

123
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,593
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,791
-Is that certain?
-Yes, sdir.

125
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,115
There doesdn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,118
But there musdt be artillery!.

127
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,355
Sir, this is sdomething
of an expedition.

128
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,798
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,953
-Two months, then.
-Three.

131
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,558
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,472
Thank you, sdir.

133
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,316
I'd like to sday, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

134
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,397
Shut up and get out.

135
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,833
Sir?

136
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,756
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?.

137
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,639
-How did you do it?
-Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,390
-Because I'm the man for the job.
-I just wonder about that.

139
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,513
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,478
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,597
Good. And when I've found him?.

142
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,835
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,834
Find out what his intentions are.
Not hisd immediate intentions.

144
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,560
That is Colonel Brighton's businesdsd,
not yours.

145
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,118
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,873
That's new.

147
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,839
Where are they now?

148
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,952
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,679
They're Hasdhemite Bedouins.

150
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,549
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,836
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,229
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desdert:

153
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,030
Bedouins and gods,
and you're neither. Take it from me.

154
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,550
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,549
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,636
It is recognised that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,437
Here you may drink.

158
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,439
One cup.

159
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,792
You do not drink?

160
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,475
No.

161
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,552
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,549
I am Bedu.

163
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,198
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,839
Yes.

165
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,118
From Cairo?

166
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,993
Yes.

167
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,791
-You did not ride from Cairo?
-No.

168
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,959
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,993
And before?

170
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,108
From Britain?.

171
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,799
Yes.

172
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,519
Truly?

173
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,479
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,959
Is that a desert country?.

175
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,317
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,114
You are not fat?.

177
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,994
No.

178
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,118
I'm different.

179
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,513
Here...

180
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,759
...take it.

181
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,076
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,873
Take it now.

183
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,032
Bedu food.

184
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,719
Good.

185
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,228
More?

186
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,270
-Bedu.
-Where?

187
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,840
From here to Lord Feisdal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,309
Yes, I know.

189
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,476
-I am not Harith.
-No.

190
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,319
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,036
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,832
When you are ready to go...

193
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,197
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,469
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,075
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,915
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,269
Now!.

198
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,633
Good?.

199
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,671
It's all right.

200
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,995
This is a Harith well.

201
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,948
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,913
Turks?.

203
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,594
Bedu.

204
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,832
Who is he?.

205
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,158
He is dead.

206
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,033
Yes.

207
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,349
Why?.

208
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,673
This is my well.

209
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,918
I have drunk from it.

210
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,677
You are welcome.

211
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,713
He was my friend.

212
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,753
-That?
-Yes, that.

213
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,077
-This pisdtol yours?
-No, hisd.

214
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,074
His?

215
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,914
Mine.

216
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,391
Then I will use it.

217
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,589
Your friend...

218
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,795
...wasd a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,479
I know.

220
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,319
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,953
I have heard of you.

222
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,312
So...

223
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,517
...what was a Hazimi doing here?.

224
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,270
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,236
-You've been sent from Cairo.
-Yes.

226
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,150
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,509
I can both read and write.

228
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,279
My Lord Feisal already
hasd an Englishman.

229
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,318
What is your name?

230
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,840
My name is for my friends.

231
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,390
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,356
You are angry, English.

233
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,991
He was nothing.

234
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,032
The well is everything.

235
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,992
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,872
He knew that.

237
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,428
Salaam.

238
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,672
Sherif Ali.

239
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,117
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,828
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,519
...a silly people.

242
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,192
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,355
Come.

244
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,038
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,316
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,870
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

247
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,192
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,396
I will find it with this.

249
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,991
Good army compass.

250
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,471
How if I take it?.

251
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,239
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,753
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,234
My fear is my concern.

254
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,079
Truly.

255
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,116
God be with you, English.

256
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,197
Hey, you!

257
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,717
-I've been waiting for you.
-Did you know I was coming?

258
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,195
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

259
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,873
How did he know?.

260
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,992
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

261
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,236
I'll give him that. No escort?

262
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,988
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

263
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,073
-Turks?.
-No, an Arab.

264
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,789
Bloody savagesd.

265
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,632
-This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?.
-Yes, they're over there.

266
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,440
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

267
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,713
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

268
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,755
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?.

269
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,914
Well, it's rather vague, sdir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

270
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,553
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

271
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,911
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

272
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,113
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

273
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,749
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

274
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,632
What I want to say is this..

275
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,559
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

276
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,591
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

277
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,588
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

278
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,753
-Do you understand what I'm saying?.
-I understand what you're saying.

279
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,872
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

280
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,271
Oh, my God.

281
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,791
Not again.

282
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,837
I've told him!.
God knows I've told him.

283
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,191
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

284
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,675
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!.

285
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,556
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

286
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,159
Fire back at them.

287
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,277
-Who are you?
-Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

288
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,238
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

289
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,716
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

290
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,315
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

291
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,433
You were right and I wasd wrong.

292
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,796
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

293
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,271
-We can take care of them at Yenbo.
-If they can get to Yenbo.

294
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,038
They can hardly come with us.

295
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,637
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

296
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,674
Lawrence.

297
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,349
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

298
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,634
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

299
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,159
First the gunsd, and now this.

300
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,034
Cigarette?

301
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,719
I'm sorry.

302
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,396
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

303
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,593
Umph off.

304
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,273
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?.

305
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,109
Hold it, Jenkins!.

306
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,919
Jenkins!.

307
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,918
Lawrence?

308
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,673
You have no servant.

309
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,434
-I don't need a servant.
-No?

310
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,434
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothesd.

311
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,631
-Yes, everything.
-I don't doubt it.

312
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,992
-It will be very nice for you.
-I can't afford it.

313
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,511
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

314
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,475
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

315
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,718
...while others travel through the
Earth in quesdt for the bounties of God.

316
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,312
Others do battle in his cause.

317
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,877
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

318
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,313
And observe the prayers.

319
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,958
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

320
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,993
Seek ye the forgivenesdsd of God.

321
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,834
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful--

322
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,519
Greetings, Ali.

323
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,511
-My lord.
-Sherif Ali.

324
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,952
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

325
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,671
Yes, my lord.

326
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,475
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

327
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,035
"By the noonday brightness...

328
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,356
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

329
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,034
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

330
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,714
...neither hath He been displeased.

331
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,232
And surely the future sdhall be better
for thee than the past."

332
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,035
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

333
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,555
...and thou be satisfied."

334
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,873
So?

335
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,028
Yes, colonel.

336
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,115
-I want a decision, sir.
-You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

337
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,039
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

338
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,239
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

339
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,396
You could supply us through Aqaba!

340
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,392
Aqaba!

341
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,913
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

342
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,071
-But you can't!
-You could.

343
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,154
You mean, the navy?.

344
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,390
The Turks have 1 2-inch guns
at Aqaba, sdir.

345
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,631
Can you imagine what that meansd?

346
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,592
Yes, I can imagine.

347
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,032
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

348
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,754
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

349
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,155
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

350
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,271
You can see that, sir, sdurely.

351
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,432
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

352
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,636
It is of little consequence to us.

353
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,196
I musdt ask you not to sdpeak like that.

354
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,113
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

355
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,112
Possibly.

356
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,069
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

357
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,953
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

358
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,315
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

359
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,438
-Guns?
-A modern rifle for every man.

360
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,632
No. Guns. Artillery.

361
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,116
Guns like the Turkish gunsd at Medina.

362
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,397
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

363
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,315
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

364
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,238
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

365
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,598
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanised army.

366
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,358
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?.

367
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,033
I think it is far from Damascus.

368
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,630
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

369
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,878
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

370
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,879
Yes, my lord.

371
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,558
It is beautiful, isd it not?

372
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,512
-Very.
-That will do, Lawrence.

373
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,833
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

374
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,148
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much sdmaller than yours.

375
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,675
Small population compared with some.

376
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,077
It's small, but it's great. And why?.

377
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,193
-Because it hasd guns.
-Because it hasd discipline.

378
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,675
Because it hasd a navy,
because of this...

379
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,558
...the English go
where they please...

380
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,400
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

381
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,796
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, that will do!.

382
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,270
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

383
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,670
But I would like to hear hisd opinion.

384
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,275
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

385
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,956
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

386
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,479
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?.
They are master and man.

387
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,275
My lord, I think....

388
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,390
I think your book is right.

389
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,111
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar isd dipped.

390
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,391
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they please...

391
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,073
...and strike where they please.

392
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,550
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

393
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,712
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

394
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,116
And this is the way you should
fight now.

395
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,958
I don't know.

396
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,435
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

397
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,392
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

398
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,790
-What is this to you?
-You're a traitor.

399
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,071
No, colonel.

400
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,596
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

401
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,912
They must say their say.

402
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,074
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

403
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,794
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

404
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,588
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

405
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,596
You tread heavily...

406
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,313
...but you sdpeak the truth.

407
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,430
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

408
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,637
...it is late.

409
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,828
Colonel Brighton means
to put my men...

410
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,878
...under European officers,
does he not?.

411
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,991
In effect, my lord, yes.

412
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,311
And I must do it...

413
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,634
...because the Turks have
European guns.

414
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,559
But I fear to do it...

415
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,675
...upon my soul I do.

416
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,838
The English have a great hunger for
desdolate places.

417
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,191
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

418
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,357
Then you must deny it to them.

419
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,195
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?.

420
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,798
To England and to other things.

421
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,679
To England and Arabia both?

422
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,677
And isd that possible?

423
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,672
I think you are another of these
desdert-loving Englisdh.

424
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,030
Doughty, Stanhope...

425
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,955
...Gordon of Khartoum.

426
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,430
No Arab Ioves the desert.

427
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,708
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

428
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,194
And no man needs nothing.

429
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,915
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

430
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,749
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

431
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,238
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

432
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,836
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

433
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,554
...were two miles of lighting
in the streetsd...

434
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,478
...when London was a village.

435
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,553
Yes, you were great.

436
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,910
Nine centuries ago.

437
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,355
Time to be great again, my lord.

438
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,870
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

439
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,868
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the Englisdh.

440
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,355
But my father is old...

441
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,078
...and I...

442
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,469
...I long for the vanisdhed
gardens of Cordoba.

443
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,278
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

444
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,479
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

445
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,749
...or....

446
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,433
Or?

447
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,595
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

448
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,268
We need a miracle.

449
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,635
Aqaba.

450
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,519
Aqaba.

451
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,952
From the land.

452
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,712
You are mad.

453
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,517
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

454
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,994
That's right.

455
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,470
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

456
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,591
I'll cross it if you will.

457
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,998
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

458
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,998
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

459
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,233
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

460
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,159
Fifty men?.

461
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,994
Fifty? Against Aqaba?.

462
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,634
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

463
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,877
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

464
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,989
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

465
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,352
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

466
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,835
-Good fighters, though.
-Good--

467
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,230
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

468
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,638
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

469
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,549
From the landward side,
there are no gunsd at Aqaba.

470
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,874
With good reasdon. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

471
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,719
Certainly the Turksd don't dream of it.

472
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,151
Aqaba's over there.

473
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,915
It's only a matter of going.

474
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,395
You are mad.

475
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,074
And where are you going, lieutenant?

476
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,436
With 50 of my men.

477
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,274
To work your miracle.

478
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,912
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for sduch a journey.

479
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,239
-Who told you?
-Ali did.

480
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,118
Why not you?

481
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,752
You are falling back from Yenbo, sdir?.

482
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,230
Yes, I must.

483
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,592
But I will spare these to you.

484
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,597
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

485
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,113
Sherif Ali owes you hisd allegiance,
my lord.

486
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,594
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

487
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,835
No.

488
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,711
Since you do know...

489
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,789
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

490
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,436
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

491
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,352
But in whose name do you ride?

492
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,599
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

493
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,115
They were here. I caught them.

494
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,192
Why are you here?. Boy!.

495
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,317
To sderve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

496
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,194
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

497
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,271
You have been tracking us.

498
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,190
-You were told to stay.
-No, sherif.

499
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,510
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

500
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,678
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

501
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,554
-It is the will of Allah.
-Blasphemy.

502
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,028
Don't do that.

503
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,230
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

504
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,559
Be warned. They are not suitable.

505
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,554
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

506
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,636
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

507
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,473
One shilling, every week?

508
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,312
That is fair.

509
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,319
-Each?
-No.

510
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,158
-That is too much.
-All right.

511
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,958
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

512
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,592
There is the railway.

513
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,392
And that is the desert.

514
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,555
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

515
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,076
For the camels, no water at all.

516
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,870
If the camels die...

517
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,553
...we die.

518
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,273
And in 20 days they will start to die.

519
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,031
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?.

520
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,878
I was thinking.

521
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,798
You were drifting.

522
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,435
Yes. It will not happen again.

523
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,395
Be warned, you were drifting.

524
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,110
It will not happen again.

525
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,117
That water is wasted.

526
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,835
From now on,
we musdt travel by night...

527
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,998
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

528
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,675
A few hours each day.

529
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,476
Why don't we start now?

530
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,359
No. We will rest now.

531
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,315
Three hours.

532
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,993
Fine.

533
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,039
I'll wake you.

534
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,112
Do we rest here?

535
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,517
There is no rest now short of water.

536
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,791
The other sdide of that.

537
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,110
And how much of that isd there?

538
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,993
I'm not sure.

539
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,477
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

540
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,790
This is the sun's anvil.

541
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,628
Have we done it?

542
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,037
No, but we're off the anvil.

543
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,433
Thank God for that anyway.

544
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,551
Yes, thank him.

545
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,389
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted him.

546
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,954
I know.

547
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,793
We've done it.

548
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,638
God willing.

549
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,796
When do we reach the wellsd?

550
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,357
God willing, midday.

551
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,276
-Then we've done it.
-Thank him, Lawrence. Thank him.

552
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,558
Gasim's.

553
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,158
What's happened to him?

554
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,439
God knows.

555
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,997
Why don't you stop?

556
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,955
For what? He will be dead by midday.

557
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,077
We must go back.

558
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,158
What for, to die with Gasim?

559
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,710
In one hour comes the sun.

560
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,870
In God'sd name, understand!
We cannot go back!

561
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,479
I can.

562
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,992
Take the boys.

563
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,314
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

564
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,835
Gasim you have killed already.

565
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,639
Get out of my way.

566
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,834
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

567
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,359
Nothing is written!.

568
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,919
Go back, then!

569
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,676
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?.

570
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,557
English blasphemer!.

571
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,272
Aqaba?

572
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,557
Was it Aqaba?.

573
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,153
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

574
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,758
Go back, blasphemer...

575
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,351
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

576
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,438
I shall be at Aqaba.

577
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,716
That is written.

578
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,634
In here.

579
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,278
English!

580
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,198
English!

581
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,192
Lawrence!. Daud!

582
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,716
Nothing is written.

583
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,512
Al Lawrence.

584
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,359
Farraj.

585
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,629
Wash.

586
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,558
Al Lawrence.

587
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:13,636
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

588
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,312
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

589
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,273
-Al Lawrence is better.
-True.

590
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,874
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

591
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,998
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

592
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,993
-Is that a lord?
-A kind of lord.

593
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,113
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

594
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,554
No.

595
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,517
You have an elder brother.

596
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,908
No.

597
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:56,200
But then, I do not undersdtand thisd.
Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,716
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,872
I see.

600
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,759
I'm sorry.

601
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,633
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

602
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,714
Yes, I supposde I am.

603
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,758
Al Lawrence is best.

604
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:25,838
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

605
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,592
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,952
Very fine.

607
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,033
-Great honour.
-The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,714
-Is it permitted?
-Surely.

609
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,948
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

610
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,236
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,038
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,953
As you see.

613
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,275
Are you alone?

614
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,352
Almost.

615
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,428
Are you with those dogsd
drinking at my well?

616
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,113
Yoursd?

617
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,477
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,113
I've heard of another man
of that name.

619
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,718
Other? What other?.

620
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,278
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,950
He musdt be a great hero.

622
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,878
He is.

623
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,317
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desdert.

624
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,710
Now, would he not?.

625
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,153
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,517
Here is my help.

627
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,873
Son, what fasdhion is this?

628
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,875
-Harith, Father.
-What manner of Harith?.

629
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,839
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,353
And isd he Harith?.

631
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,755
No, Father, English.

632
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,359
Son...

633
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,270
...they are sdtealing our water.

634
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,031
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,869
Tell them.

636
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,472
-Empty that!
-Do not!

637
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,955
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,756
It is Ali of the Harith who ansdwers.

639
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,234
Harith.

640
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,269
Ali.

641
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,230
Does your father still steal?

642
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,554
No.

643
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,152
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

644
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,511
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,789
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,158
-Auda flatters me.
-You are easdily flattered.

647
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,148
I knew your father well.

648
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,391
Did you know your own?

649
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,476
We are 50, you are two.
How if we sdhot you down?.

650
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,072
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

651
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,432
-Do you desire it?.
-Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,992
...nor the sdultan himself desire that.

653
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,349
Call off your men.

654
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,519
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,956
I've only jusdt begun to teach him.

656
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,432
And what are you teaching him today?.
Howeitat hospitality?.

657
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,671
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,710
-Who is he?.
-A friend of Prince Feisal'sd.

659
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,397
-So you desire my hospitality?
-Yes.

660
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,079
Is he your tongue?.

661
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,592
We do desire it.

662
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,877
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,231
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:53,235
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,391
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,914
But...

667
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,753
...dine with me.

668
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,599
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,914
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:14,435
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,755
This thing you work againsdt Aqaba...

672
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:00,554
...what profit do you hope from it?.

673
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:03,354
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,670
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,594
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,594
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

677
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,753
But I....
I cannot serve.

678
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,677
You permit the Turks to sdtay in Aqaba.

679
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,951
Yes, it isd my pleasure.

680
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:31,430
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:32,949
No?

682
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,673
-For the English, then?.
-For the Arabsd.

683
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,713
The Arabs?.

684
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:43,798
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,991
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,159
But the Arabsd?

687
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,790
What tribe is that?

688
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,632
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

689
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,876
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,037
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,595
Who work only for profit.

692
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,472
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:08,313
And Auda's pleasure is
to sderve the Turks.

694
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,629
Serve?

695
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,155
I serve?

696
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,033
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,038
I am Auda Abu T ayi.

698
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,151
-Does Auda serve?
-No!

699
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:26,517
-Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?.
-No!

700
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:35,278
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

701
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:39,235
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

702
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,638
I scatter, I burn my enemies tentsd.
I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,958
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!.

704
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,352
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,189
Is that service?

706
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,034
No.

707
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,275
And yet now it sdeems Auda
hasd grown old.

708
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,233
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,552
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

710
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,548
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,551
Why should they wish to?

712
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:30,789
Now....

713
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:35,552
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,075
...a servant's wagesd.

715
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,233
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:46,592
...1 00 golden guineas.

717
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,911
1 50, Auda.

718
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,078
-Who told you that?
-I have long ears.

719
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,589
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,150
1 00, 1 50, what matters?.
It's a trifle.

721
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:04,148
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

722
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,351
In Aqaba.

723
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,319
-In Aqaba?
-Where else?

724
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,118
You trouble me like women.

725
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,591
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

726
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,429
-For money?.
-No.

727
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,949
-For Feisal?.
-No!

728
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,232
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,877
He will come...

730
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:30,109
...because it isd his pleasure.

731
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:35,795
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,636
Make God your agent!.

733
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,155
Aqaba!

734
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,032
Aqaba!

735
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,711
God be with you.

736
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,318
God be with you.

737
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,354
God be with you.

738
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,836
God be with you.

739
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,879
Yes.

740
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,235
Aqaba.

741
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,519
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,718
-Do you think we sdhall?
-Yes.

743
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,633
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,279
He killed. He dies.

745
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,235
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,751
One of our men
murdered Auda's man.

747
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:15,909
Why?.

748
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:19,157
Theft?. Blood feud?.
It makes no matter why.

749
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:20,834
Ali!

750
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,071
It is an ancient wound.

751
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,272
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

752
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,910
It is the Iaw, Lawrence.

753
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:35,429
The law says the man must die.

754
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,432
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

755
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,668
Yes.

756
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:46,798
Sherif Ali!

757
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,952
If none of Lord Auda'sd men harmsd
any of yours...

758
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,551
-...will that content the Harith?.
-Yes.

759
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,314
Then I will execute the Iaw.

760
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,470
I have no tribe.

761
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,995
And no one is offended.

762
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,469
Gasim.

763
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,399
Did you do it?

764
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,998
Well, Lawrence....

765
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,919
What ailsd the Englishman?

766
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:09,550
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

767
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,791
It was written, then.

768
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,676
Better to have left him.

769
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,590
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

770
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,270
Besides, it was necessary.

771
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,590
You gave life and you took it.

772
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,718
The writing is still yours.

773
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,990
Auda Abu T ayi!

774
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,270
The miracle is accomplished.

775
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,918
Garlands for the conqueror.

776
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,191
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

777
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,672
I'm none of those thingsd, Ali.

778
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,554
-What, then?
-Don't know.

779
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,959
Thanks.

780
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:05,630
My God, I love this country.

781
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,309
What!

782
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,237
No gold in Aqaba!

783
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,989
Auda, I found it!

784
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:25,838
That's a pity.

785
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,960
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

786
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,668
Tell Feisdal to find boats,
any boats...

787
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:38,037
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

788
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,389
And you?

789
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,714
I'm going to tell the generals...

790
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,031
...in Cairo.

791
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,549
Yes, cross Sinai.

792
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,869
Come on!

793
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,519
Sinai?

794
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,359
Yes.

795
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,555
-With these?
-They'll be all right with me.

796
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,918
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

797
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:09,038
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

798
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,119
I see.

799
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,871
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

800
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:19,278
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

801
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,150
...and then they will believe you.

802
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,915
You're an ignorant man.

803
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,353
Paper.

804
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,077
Paper!

805
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,473
There is no gold in Aqaba.

806
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,431
No gold.

807
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,756
No great box!

808
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,269
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

809
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,115
For my pleasure, as you sdaid.

810
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,874
But gold is honourable...

811
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,633
...and Lawrence promised gold.

812
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,869
Lawrence Iied.

813
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,273
See, Auda.

814
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:28,076
"The Crown of England...

815
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:31,628
...promises to pay...

816
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:36,997
...5000 golden guineas...

817
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:42,230
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

818
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:47,638
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

819
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,319
...by...

820
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,234
...me.

821
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:55,470
In 1 0 days...

822
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,316
...I'll be back with the gold.

823
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:04,155
With gold, with guns, with everything.

824
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,832
Ten days.

825
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:09,758
You'll cross Sinai?.

826
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,439
Why not?

827
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,878
Moses did.

828
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,715
And you will take the children?

829
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:21,393
Moses did.

830
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:23,358
Mosesd was a prophet...

831
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,434
...and beloved of God.

832
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,878
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

833
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:40,038
He is not perfect.

834
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,548
Lord, can we not rest?

835
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,871
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

836
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,792
Have you two slept in beds?

837
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,274
Farraj?

838
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:03,199
Daud?

839
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:06,072
With sheets?

840
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,436
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

841
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,999
I promise.

842
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,913
Then it shall be so, Iord.

843
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,599
Look!

844
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,952
Pillar of fire.

845
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,151
No, lord. Dust.

846
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,279
My compass.

847
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,354
No matter.

848
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,549
If we ride west,
we musdt strike the canal.

849
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,033
Due west.

850
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,193
Come on!

851
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:51,239
Lawrence!.

852
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,234
Farraj!

853
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,432
Farraj, don't! Don't!

854
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,879
Don't!

855
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,509
Why do you walk?

856
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,191
But why, lord?.

857
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,788
But why, lord?.

858
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,510
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

859
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,754
Lawrence, Iook!.

860
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,676
It's all right, Farraj.

861
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,472
It's all right.

862
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,277
Who are you?

863
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:18,039
Who are you?

864
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:56,074
-Daud!.
-We're here, sir.

865
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,838
You taking him in there?.

866
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,313
Yes.

867
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:40,273
Here!

868
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,509
Here. You!

869
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:49,550
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

870
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:51,799
We are thirsty.

871
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:56,074
-Mr. Lawrence, is it?.
-Yes.

872
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:59,637
-Are you going to the officers' bar?
-Yes.

873
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,155
You can't take him in there, sir.

874
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,354
What do you think you look like?

875
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:29,672
No, no. You must go.

876
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,518
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

877
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,113
Get out! You must get out!. Get out!

878
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:42,032
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

879
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:46,074
-This is a bar for Britisdh officers.
-We are not particular.

880
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:55,359
-Are you off your head?
-No. Oddly enough I'm not.

881
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:59,195
-Just clear out of here, will you?.
-Get that boy out of here.

882
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:02,233
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

883
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,440
-Get that wog out of here.
-Clear off.

884
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,278
What's going on?

885
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:16,153
-It's Lawrence, sir.
-Lemonade with ice.

886
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:19,072
Explain yourself.

887
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,552
We've taken Aqaba.

888
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:24,753
-Taken Aqaba? Who has?
-We have.

889
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,471
Our sdide in this war has.
The wogs have.

890
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,593
We have.

891
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:35,237
He likes your lemonade.

892
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,511
You mean the Turks have gone?.

893
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,758
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

894
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:45,398
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

895
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:48,110
That's not true. We killed some.

896
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:52,279
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

897
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:56,478
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

898
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:02,115
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

899
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:05,118
-It isn't possible.
-Yes, it isd.

900
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,271
I did it.

901
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,158
You'd better talk to Allenby.

902
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:17,199
-General Allenby?.
-He's in command. Murray's gone.

903
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:19,710
That's a step in the right direction.

904
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:23,199
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sdheets.

905
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,239
-Yes, of course.
-It's for him.

906
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:30,838
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?.

907
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:33,151
See Allenby first, though.

908
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:35,438
Will he see me?

909
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,679
I think so.

910
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:39,998
Do that, then.

911
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:47,474
-I'd better shave.
-Yes, you had.

912
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:50,314
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

913
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,351
"Undisciplined.

914
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,191
Unpunctual.

915
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:10,271
Untidy.

916
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,236
Several languages.

917
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,511
Knowledge of music...

918
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,197
...Iiterature.

919
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:23,196
Knowledge of....

920
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,357
Knowledge of...."

921
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:32,518
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

922
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:36,272
-Who told you to take Aqaba?
-Nobody.

923
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:39,239
-Sir.
-Sir.

924
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:40,879
Then why did you?

925
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,554
-Aqaba's important.
-Why is it important?

926
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:46,320
-It's the Turkish route to the canal.
-Not anymore.

927
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,712
-They're coming through Beersheba.
-I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

928
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:55,510
-So?
-So that left Aqaba behind your right.

929
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,115
True.

930
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:01,950
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

931
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,234
Am I going for Jerusalem?

932
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,709
Yes.

933
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:10,513
Very well.

934
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:13,035
Aqaba behind my right.

935
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:16,118
It threatened El' Arîsh and Gaza.

936
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,828
Anything else?

937
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:20,274
Yes.

938
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:23,034
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

939
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:26,592
Do you think we sdhould shift them
out of Medina now?

940
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:30,435
No. I think you should
leave them there.

941
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:32,591
You acted without orders, you know.

942
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:37,552
Shouldn't officers usde
their initiative at all times?.

943
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:40,115
Not really. It'sd awfully dangerous.

944
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,629
Yes, I know.

945
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,473
Already?

946
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:45,954
Yes.

947
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:50,319
I'm promoting you major.

948
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:53,595
I don't think that's a very good idea.

949
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:56,872
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

950
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:00,795
...and carry on the good work.

951
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:04,113
No. Thank you, sir.

952
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:08,599
-Why not?
-Well, I, it's....

953
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,119
Let me see now....

954
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:15,594
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

955
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,995
One was a boy.

956
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,673
That was...

957
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:23,151
...yesterday.

958
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,396
I led him into a quicksand.

959
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:27,312
The other was a man.

960
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:29,596
That was...

961
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,229
...before Aqaba, anyway.

962
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:35,639
I had to execute him with my pistol.

963
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:39,157
There was something about it
I didn't like.

964
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:42,551
-Well, naturally.
-No. Something else.

965
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:47,149
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

966
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:49,516
No. Something else.

967
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:52,712
What, then?

968
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:55,995
I enjoyed it.

969
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:07,035
Rubbisdh. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

970
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:12,389
What do you mean coming dressed
like that?. Amateur theatricals?

971
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:14,358
Yes. Entirely.

972
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,711
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

973
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:20,031
Fascinating gear they wear.

974
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:22,555
How would I look in this, Harry?

975
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:26,230
-Damn ridiculous, sir.
-Here, you keep it.

976
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:31,233
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

977
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:34,392
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

978
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:39,951
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

979
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:43,312
-Brighton?
-I know what he thinks.

980
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:47,790
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

981
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:51,078
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

982
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:54,397
It wasd a brilliant bit of soldiering.

983
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:57,837
-Mr. Perkins!.
-Sir!

984
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,719
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

985
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:08,116
-You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?.
-Yes, sdir.

986
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:12,632
-What do you think about it?
-Bloody marvellous, sdir. Well done.

987
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:15,912
-Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
-Sir!

988
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,238
Come on, then.

989
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,597
You're a clever man, sir.

990
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:32,509
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

991
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:35,479
That's fair, surely?

992
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,154
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I musdt concentrate, not dissipate.

993
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:03,635
-Bravo.
-You know better?.

994
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:26,033
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

995
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:28,669
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?.

996
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:07,708
Easy, gentlemen, please.

997
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:11,075
-Give us something to drink.
-Of course, sir.

998
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:15,195
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

999
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:17,109
Tracy.

1000
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,871
Shall we go outside?

1001
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:35,356
So you hold bound the Turkish
desdert army?.

1002
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,595
Yes.

1003
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,155
With 1 000 Arabsd?

1004
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,391
1 000 Arabs means 1 000 knives.

1005
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:45,551
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1006
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:47,792
It means 1 000 camels.

1007
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:52,358
That means 1 000 packs of high
explosives and 1 000 crack rifles.

1008
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:56,674
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1009
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:59,151
I'll smash his railways.

1010
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,908
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1011
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:04,958
In 1 3 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaosd.

1012
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,589
You are going back, then?

1013
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:11,668
Yes.

1014
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:14,429
Of course I'm going back.

1015
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:21,194
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1016
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:25,718
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

1017
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:27,109
...he'll withdraw.

1018
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:30,033
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1019
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:32,794
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1020
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:35,554
-I wonder who will.
-No one will.

1021
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:38,435
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1022
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:46,715
That's what I've told them anyway.

1023
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,997
That's what they think.

1024
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:52,711
-That's why they're fighting.
-Oh, surely.

1025
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:57,989
They've only one sduspicion.

1026
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:02,831
That we'll let them drive the Turksd
out and then move in ourselves.

1027
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:07,511
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1028
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:08,829
Have we?

1029
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:11,470
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1030
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:14,837
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1031
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:18,070
Difficult question, sdir.

1032
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:23,868
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1033
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:27,516
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1034
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,039
Certainly.

1035
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:51,030
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1036
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:52,389
Right.

1037
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:56,030
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1038
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:00,430
-Instructors for the Lewis guns.
-Right.

1039
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,198
More money.

1040
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:05,711
-How much more?.
-25,000 now. A lot more later.

1041
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:08,639
-Dryden?
-It can be done, sir.

1042
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:11,713
A couple of armoured cars.

1043
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:13,279
Right.

1044
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,558
Field artillery.

1045
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:19,119
Right.

1046
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,310
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

1047
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:27,438
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1048
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:30,393
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1049
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:07,957
Congratulations!.

1050
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:21,272
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sdir?.

1051
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:23,317
I was wondering that, sir.

1052
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,795
Might be difficult to get it back.

1053
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,595
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1054
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,711
Then I can't give it to them, can l?.

1055
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:33,871
-For you to say.
-No, it's not.

1056
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:36,873
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1057
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,116
Not like that poor devil.

1058
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:41,158
He's riding the whirlwind.

1059
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:43,590
Let's hope we're not.

1060
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:10,591
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1061
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:12,354
To Prince Feisal.

1062
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:15,353
-You're not Prince Feisdal?
-No.

1063
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:16,993
You know him though?

1064
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:20,630
He is my master. I am his servant.

1065
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,159
Can you read?

1066
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,311
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1067
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:42,115
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1068
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,469
Now....

1069
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:02,639
-Where can I find Major Lawrence?.
-Is that what you have come for?

1070
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:04,996
Not altogether, sir, no.

1071
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:09,597
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1072
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:12,912
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1073
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,349
I don't know.

1074
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:17,713
-Lasdt week they were near El Ghira.
-Ghira?

1075
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:21,754
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1076
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:25,359
-I've never tried.
-Take a mule.

1077
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:27,996
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1078
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:30,994
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1079
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,514
They do.

1080
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:35,871
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1081
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:37,719
Myself...

1082
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:40,237
...I am going to Cairo.

1083
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,431
-As you know.
-Yes.

1084
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:45,194
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1085
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:46,948
Yes.

1086
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:52,909
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

1087
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:55,920
-That is so.
-You're handicapped?

1088
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,150
It restricts us to sdmall things.

1089
02:25:58,360 --> 02:25:59,679
It's intended to.

1090
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:03,952
Do you know General Allenby?

1091
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:08,430
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1092
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:11,433
-Excuse me?.
-A clever man.

1093
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:14,598
Slim customer. It's very good.

1094
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:19,431
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1095
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,235
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1096
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,795
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1097
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:28,275
...who struggle for their freedom.

1098
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:30,670
Very gratifying.

1099
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:37,797
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your sdtory told.

1100
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:40,269
I badly want a story to tell.

1101
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:44,274
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1102
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:47,793
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1103
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,956
And before I leave here...

1104
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:52,589
...which must be presently...

1105
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:56,315
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1106
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:01,351
You know that we are
desdtroying the Turkish railways.

1107
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:02,715
I do, sir.

1108
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:05,832
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?.

1109
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:08,588
My army is made up of tribesd.

1110
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:11,832
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1111
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,151
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?.

1112
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:18,432
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1113
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,350
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1114
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:26,676
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1115
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:29,513
...beyond every other man.

1116
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:33,357
One figure I can give you
from my head...

1117
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:37,195
...because it never leaves my head.

1118
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:41,753
Since sdtarting thisd campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1119
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:45,148
...37 wounded...

1120
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:51,036
...1 56 dead.

1121
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:57,350
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1122
02:27:57,560 --> 02:27:58,879
Yeah.

1123
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:00,599
Four times as many.

1124
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:05,550
That's because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselvesd kill.

1125
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:08,268
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1126
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:12,395
-You mean...?
-We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1127
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:16,316
In their eyes, we are not
soldiersd but rebels.

1128
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:20,991
Rebelsd, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1129
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:23,117
...and are treated harshly.

1130
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:24,869
How harshly?

1131
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:28,078
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1132
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:29,909
I see.

1133
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:33,311
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1134
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,354
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1135
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:41,633
-I should like you to notice that.
-Yes, sdir.

1136
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:45,234
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?.

1137
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,073
Why should you sduppose?

1138
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:49,754
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1139
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:52,428
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1140
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,358
That is exactly so.

1141
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:58,030
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1142
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:01,278
With me, it is merely good manners.

1143
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:05,592
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1144
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:09,596
-And now, perhaps....
-Oh, sure, sure.

1145
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:15,392
Thank you, sdir.

1146
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:17,352
Can you manage the letter--?

1147
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:20,433
I'll do everything I have said...

1148
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:24,229
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1149
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:26,874
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1150
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:31,917
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1151
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:34,634
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1152
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:35,949
Oh, no.

1153
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:39,994
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1154
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:42,953
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1155
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,191
And Turkey.

1156
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:49,792
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is....

1157
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:52,754
-Enjoyable?
-Hardly that, sir.

1158
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,992
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1159
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:59,829
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1160
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:03,197
All right. Yes.

1161
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,478
Lawrence is your man.

1162
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:46,349
Stop!.

1163
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:07,398
Stop it!

1164
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:09,593
Stop it!

1165
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,273
Come on, men!

1166
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:29,799
Lawrence!

1167
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:52,471
Good God! God!

1168
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:43,670
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1169
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,150
Why don't you take a picture?

1170
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:47,834
Wish I had.

1171
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:54,270
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1172
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:57,555
Am I in this?.

1173
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,278
Did you take his picture?.

1174
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:01,748
Yeah.

1175
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:10,352
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1176
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:14,916
Charming company you keep.

1177
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:16,388
Auda?

1178
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:22,228
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these thingsd will steal his virtue.

1179
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:24,670
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1180
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:27,036
It's all right to take your picture?

1181
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,079
-All right.
-Okay.

1182
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:30,753
Just walk.

1183
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,150
Major Lawrence!.

1184
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:36,473
Yes, sdir, that's my baby.

1185
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,114
This looting has got to stop!

1186
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:48,673
It is customary.

1187
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:52,509
It's theft. And theft makesd thieves.

1188
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:54,995
I would not say that to Auda.

1189
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,318
-It is their payment, colonel.
-Payment.

1190
02:35:58,520 --> 02:36:01,318
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1191
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:05,510
-They don't go home when being paid.
-They are not free to.

1192
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:14,393
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the lasdt of.

1193
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:16,318
They'll come back.

1194
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:20,072
He saysd they'll come back.
Will they?

1195
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:22,555
Not this year, Lawrence.

1196
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:27,717
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?.

1197
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:30,718
-Lesdsd.
-Well, then?.

1198
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:33,395
I said, they'll come back.

1199
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:35,308
You badly hurt?

1200
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:38,592
Not hurt at all.

1201
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:42,992
Didn't you know?. They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1202
02:36:58,760 --> 02:37:02,594
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1203
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:06,589
-What are you learning from this?
-Politics.

1204
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:11,756
You'll be a democracy in this country?.
You gonna have a parliament?

1205
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:14,715
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1206
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:18,279
Did I answer well?

1207
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:22,838
You answered without
saying anything. That's politics.

1208
02:37:24,120 --> 02:37:25,758
You learn quickly.

1209
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:29,270
I have a good teacher.

1210
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,273
Yeah.

1211
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,877
-How's your hurt?
-Fine.

1212
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:47,915
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1213
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:51,157
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?.

1214
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:54,790
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question sdtraight.

1215
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,149
One.

1216
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:00,599
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?.

1217
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:03,314
They hope to gain their freedom.

1218
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:05,635
Freedom.

1219
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:09,753
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1220
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,629
-There's one born every minute.
-They're going to get it.

1221
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:16,635
I'm going to give it to them.

1222
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:24,156
-The second question?
-Well, I was going to ask...

1223
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:28,639
...what is it that attracts you
persdonally to the desert?

1224
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:32,676
It's clean.

1225
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,033
Well, now...

1226
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:40,036
...that'sd a very illuminating answer.

1227
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:42,032
May I...

1228
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:45,194
...take one farewell picture?.

1229
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:49,072
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1230
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:52,318
One clock for two lamps.

1231
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:54,028
A fair bargain.

1232
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:56,879
Fair? I robbed him.

1233
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:09,833
Trash.

1234
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:13,349
I musdt find something honourable.

1235
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,193
Honourable?

1236
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:19,594
The year is running out, Brighton.

1237
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,992
I musdt find something honourable.

1238
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,710
Now you may blow up my train.

1239
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,718
And what will you do now?.

1240
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:07,516
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1241
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:10,271
They will carry my toys too, see?

1242
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:13,717
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1243
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,390
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1244
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:22,236
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wantsd, he will go home.

1245
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,034
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1246
02:42:25,240 --> 02:42:26,912
No, I shan't, Auda.

1247
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:29,079
Then you are a fool.

1248
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:32,752
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1249
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:36,075
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1250
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:39,397
...that when he made you a fool,
he gave you a fool's face.

1251
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:42,750
You are an impudent rascal.

1252
02:42:44,240 --> 02:42:48,597
I musdt go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1253
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:00,712
Like talking to a brick wall.

1254
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:12,073
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1255
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:14,432
I'll go north.

1256
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:17,631
That's what Allenby wants.

1257
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:21,958
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1258
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:24,475
Then that's where I'll take it.

1259
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:30,315
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusdalem.

1260
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:31,749
Won't we?.

1261
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:05,275
Train, Farraj.

1262
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:07,833
Yeah, Lawrence.

1263
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:38,871
Hide yourself, my friend.

1264
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:49,559
Detonator.

1265
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:04,718
All right, fetch another.

1266
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:08,708
-Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
-Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1267
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:15,553
Farraj?

1268
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:28,917
-What happened?.
-Detonator. A detonator!

1269
02:45:42,440 --> 02:45:44,908
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

1270
02:45:54,440 --> 02:45:57,273
If they take him alive,
you know what they'll do to him.

1271
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:12,114
Daud will be angry with you.

1272
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:14,997
Salute him for me.

1273
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,472
What will you do now?

1274
02:46:37,960 --> 02:46:39,439
Go north.

1275
02:46:39,640 --> 02:46:41,119
With twenty?

1276
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,434
What would
you recommend me to do?.

1277
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:48,151
What would you recommend?

1278
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:55,515
He hasn't 1 /1 0 so many men, sir.

1279
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:57,557
He's lied, in fact.

1280
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:02,629
Yes and no. He doesdn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1281
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:05,513
Then there is an Arab north army.

1282
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:11,516
-No, sir, he has lied about that.
-Any idea why?.

1283
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:15,959
-It's his army, I supposde.
-It's Prince Feisdal's army.

1284
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:19,874
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?.

1285
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:22,838
No.

1286
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:27,555
He would if he could, I think.

1287
02:47:29,360 --> 02:47:32,830
-Not my line of country.
-It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1288
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:35,755
What matters is I believed it.

1289
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:37,712
The Turks believe it.

1290
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:41,390
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

1291
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:45,078
Good heavens.

1292
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:49,269
-Shouldn't say he had long to live.
-Whatever else, he's a brave man--

1293
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:53,877
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesdn't lack guts.

1294
02:47:55,080 --> 02:47:57,878
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1295
02:47:59,560 --> 02:48:03,678
What about next year?
Will they still come back?.

1296
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:05,911
I wouldn't be surprised.

1297
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:09,749
-They think he's a kind of prophet.
-They do or he does?

1298
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:27,914
-Now may I speak?
-Yes.

1299
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:31,751
One more failure and you will find
yoursdelf alone.

1300
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:36,630
-I do not include myself.
-I do not include the others.

1301
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:39,110
So say they love you.

1302
02:48:39,560 --> 02:48:42,074
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1303
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:45,397
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1304
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:47,795
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1305
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:51,237
That's right. That's right.

1306
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:54,308
Who are you to know
what can be done?.

1307
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:58,475
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1308
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:03,477
Whatever I ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don't.

1309
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:08,558
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1310
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:10,439
Do you?

1311
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:16,996
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1312
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:24,831
-Who will come with me into Deraa?.
-Deraa is garrisoned.

1313
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,116
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1314
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:31,074
-I'll go by myself if I have to.
-Why?.

1315
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:33,151
Because I told the Englisdh generals...

1316
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:37,069
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1317
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:39,636
Or perhaps you are here...

1318
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:42,156
...for the English generals.

1319
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:45,872
Who says this?

1320
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:47,513
Rumour.

1321
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:51,354
That is not an argument.

1322
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,795
Oh, argument.

1323
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,356
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1324
02:49:57,640 --> 02:50:00,029
...while the Arabs argue.

1325
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:05,117
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1326
02:50:05,480 --> 02:50:09,234
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothesd.

1327
02:50:18,520 --> 02:50:19,714
It's madness.

1328
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:24,997
What are you looking for?

1329
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:27,714
Some way to announce myself.

1330
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:29,876
Be patient with him, God.

1331
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:47,558
-Do you not see how they look at you?.
-Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1332
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:49,073
Halt!

1333
02:50:49,280 --> 02:50:50,508
Walk on.

1334
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:52,557
-Halt!
-Walk on.

1335
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:55,910
You and you.

1336
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:38,155
You.

1337
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:56,716
You have blue eyes.

1338
02:52:57,560 --> 02:53:01,838
-I say you have blue eyes.
-Yes, effendi.

1339
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:05,316
-Are you Circassian?
-Yes, effendi.

1340
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:07,792
How old are you?

1341
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:11,032
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1342
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:13,157
I think.

1343
02:53:13,400 --> 02:53:17,916
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1344
02:53:19,240 --> 02:53:21,310
It's an interesting face.

1345
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:28,388
I am surrounded by cattle.

1346
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:32,709
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

1347
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:37,759
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1348
02:53:37,960 --> 02:53:42,351
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1349
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:44,391
...isolated.

1350
02:53:46,320 --> 02:53:48,914
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

1351
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:50,918
No, effendi.

1352
02:53:53,480 --> 02:53:54,879
Have you?

1353
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:57,399
No.

1354
02:53:58,080 --> 02:53:59,911
That would be too...

1355
02:54:00,120 --> 02:54:01,758
...Iucky.

1356
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:27,992
Where did you get that?

1357
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:34,072
-It's old, effendi.
-No, this is recent.

1358
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:38,395
-You are a deserter.
-No, effendi.

1359
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:40,517
Yes, you are a deserter.

1360
02:54:41,640 --> 02:54:43,870
But from which army?.

1361
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:48,630
Not that it matters at all.

1362
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:51,315
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1363
02:55:02,840 --> 02:55:04,796
Your skin is very fair.

1364
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:24,954
Beat him.

1365
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:00,919
To me!

1366
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:04,958
Sleep.

1367
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,278
Sleep.

1368
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,399
Eat.

1369
02:59:27,240 --> 02:59:28,559
Eat.

1370
02:59:32,400 --> 02:59:35,233
You have a body, like other men.

1371
02:59:43,720 --> 02:59:44,755
Good.

1372
02:59:45,960 --> 02:59:47,712
Then sleep.

1373
03:00:01,240 --> 03:00:02,514
Better?

1374
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:05,839
Much better. You were right.

1375
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:08,270
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1376
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:11,310
Oh, I've learned all right.

1377
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:18,798
I'm going, Ali.

1378
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:21,956
-Why?.
-Why?.

1379
03:00:23,280 --> 03:00:24,508
Heavens.

1380
03:00:24,800 --> 03:00:26,119
Why?.

1381
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,230
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1382
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:31,471
And the end of the Arab revolt?.

1383
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:34,877
I'm not the Arab revolt, AIi.
I'm not even Arab.

1384
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:38,152
A man can be whatever he wantsd.
You said.

1385
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:41,432
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1386
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:43,636
You proved it.

1387
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:45,990
Look, Ali. Look.

1388
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:50,034
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1389
03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:53,149
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1390
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:55,999
A man can do whatever he wantsd.
You said.

1391
03:00:57,800 --> 03:00:59,279
He can...

1392
03:00:59,480 --> 03:01:02,358
...but he can't want what he wantsd.

1393
03:01:03,320 --> 03:01:06,517
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1394
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:13,148
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1395
03:01:13,360 --> 03:01:17,319
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1396
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:20,318
-I tried to.
-So would any man.

1397
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:24,035
Well, any man is what I am.

1398
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:29,033
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1399
03:01:29,320 --> 03:01:31,390
...that any man can do.

1400
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:33,557
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1401
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:36,559
-I'll make easdy stages.
-You?

1402
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:41,550
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1403
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:47,876
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

1404
03:01:48,120 --> 03:01:49,712
...ordinarily...

1405
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:51,799
...happy.

1406
03:01:55,600 --> 03:01:57,238
Can I take thisd?

1407
03:01:57,880 --> 03:01:59,757
It is not clean.

1408
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:03,077
No, but it'sd warm.

1409
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:04,759
And these...

1410
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:08,919
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1411
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:15,594
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1412
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:20,035
And let me go back to mine.

1413
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:52,277
-I say, don't forget those form fives.
-All right.

1414
03:02:58,120 --> 03:02:59,951
Mind if I join you?

1415
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:02,472
Honoured, sir.

1416
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:08,156
-Good to be back.
-We heard you were, sir.

1417
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:11,274
-What's doing out there?.
-Where?

1418
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:13,755
-Arabia?
-Well, yes, sdir.

1419
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:17,310
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?.

1420
03:03:17,600 --> 03:03:19,989
We're settling in.
We built a squasdh court.

1421
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:21,633
Jolly good.

1422
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:26,473
Well, I have to go up there.

1423
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:29,948
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1424
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:31,912
Bloody wogs.

1425
03:03:33,320 --> 03:03:35,197
Yes, probably.

1426
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:38,349
Jolly good about the squash court.

1427
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,554
Laysd it on a bit thick, doesn't he?.

1428
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:58,074
Morning.

1429
03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:00,037
-Good morning, sir.
-Good to be back.

1430
03:04:00,320 --> 03:04:03,357
-I'll believe you, sir.
-No, really it is.

1431
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:07,999
Hello.

1432
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:11,711
Morning. You're to go right in.

1433
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:25,233
Lawrence.

1434
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,560
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1435
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:31,593
Sir.

1436
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:39,231
Well, general, I will leave you.

1437
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:42,398
Major Lawrence doubtlesdsd
hasd reports to make...

1438
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:46,468
...about my people
and their weakness...

1439
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:51,515
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

1440
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:57,589
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1441
03:04:57,760 --> 03:04:59,796
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1442
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:04,551
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1443
03:05:04,760 --> 03:05:06,751
I know this treaty does exisdt.

1444
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,911
Treaty, sir?.

1445
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:13,111
He does it better than you, general.

1446
03:05:13,400 --> 03:05:16,631
But then, of course,
he isd almost an Arab.

1447
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:32,432
You really don't know?

1448
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:36,791
Then what the devil's this?

1449
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:41,679
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1450
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:43,273
For what reason?.

1451
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:45,789
You sure you haven't heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1452
03:05:45,960 --> 03:05:47,359
No.

1453
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:51,317
-I can guess.
-Don't guess. Tell him.

1454
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:54,473
Well, now....

1455
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:57,992
Mr. Sykesd isd an English civil servant.

1456
03:05:58,200 --> 03:06:01,317
Monsdieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1457
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:05,678
Mr. Sykesd and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1458
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,310
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1459
03:06:09,600 --> 03:06:11,318
Including Arabia.

1460
03:06:11,600 --> 03:06:15,673
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1461
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:18,997
An agreement to that effect.

1462
03:06:19,680 --> 03:06:23,195
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1463
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:26,193
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1464
03:06:26,520 --> 03:06:29,637
You may not have known,
but you certainly had sduspicions.

1465
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:33,476
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1466
03:06:33,680 --> 03:06:38,151
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1467
03:06:38,360 --> 03:06:43,115
But a man who tells half-lies
hasd forgotten where he put it.

1468
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:46,990
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1469
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:49,869
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1470
03:06:51,360 --> 03:06:53,351
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1471
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:55,909
That's my reason for resigning.

1472
03:06:57,200 --> 03:06:58,872
It's personal.

1473
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,235
-Personal?.
-Yes, sdir.

1474
03:07:01,560 --> 03:07:04,632
Personal?.
You're a serving officer in the field.

1475
03:07:04,880 --> 03:07:08,190
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?.

1476
03:07:08,520 --> 03:07:11,717
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1477
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:13,990
That's my reason too.

1478
03:07:14,200 --> 03:07:19,228
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 1 6th of next month...

1479
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:21,391
...and you are part of it.

1480
03:07:21,880 --> 03:07:25,555
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1481
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:29,673
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1482
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:32,436
What about your Arab friends?.

1483
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:36,508
I have no Arab friends!.
I don't want Arab friends!

1484
03:07:36,760 --> 03:07:38,910
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1485
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:44,234
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1486
03:07:44,560 --> 03:07:47,438
-Lawrence.
-Yes?

1487
03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:52,913
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1488
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:55,276
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1489
03:07:55,560 --> 03:07:57,278
Thank you, sdir.

1490
03:07:58,320 --> 03:08:00,550
Why don't we...?

1491
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:04,951
There's blood on your back.

1492
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:09,312
-Do you want a doctor?
-No.

1493
03:08:10,480 --> 03:08:12,675
Tell me what happened.

1494
03:08:17,640 --> 03:08:19,790
Say, what goes on in there?.

1495
03:08:20,600 --> 03:08:22,431
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on!

1496
03:08:22,720 --> 03:08:26,110
-No, really. Nothing at all.
-Is the man in trouble?.

1497
03:08:26,320 --> 03:08:30,279
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1498
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:34,479
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1499
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:38,156
-What claim?
-I've made that boy a hero.

1500
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:41,113
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1501
03:08:41,320 --> 03:08:45,632
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1502
03:08:46,160 --> 03:08:48,993
Will you kindly allow me to pass?.

1503
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:51,988
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1504
03:08:52,280 --> 03:08:55,033
Always walking away, aren't you?.

1505
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:56,833
Well, I'll tell you.

1506
03:08:57,040 --> 03:08:59,998
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1507
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:03,152
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1508
03:09:03,360 --> 03:09:06,158
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1509
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,992
I believe your name will
be a housdehold word...

1510
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:14,149
...when you'd have to go to the
war musdeum to find who Allenby was.

1511
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:17,952
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1512
03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:20,039
Leave me alone.

1513
03:09:20,360 --> 03:09:22,828
-Leave me alone.
-That's a feeble thing to say.

1514
03:09:23,080 --> 03:09:25,674
-I know I'm not ordinary.
-That's not what I'm saying.

1515
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:28,678
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1516
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:31,749
What of it?

1517
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:34,879
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1518
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:38,191
It's a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

1519
03:09:38,360 --> 03:09:40,510
Are you speaking from experience?.

1520
03:09:40,840 --> 03:09:42,193
No.

1521
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:44,191
You're guessing, then.

1522
03:09:45,360 --> 03:09:46,713
Suppose you're wrong.

1523
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:50,037
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1524
03:09:50,880 --> 03:09:53,838
-Yes. I said, yes.
-After all--

1525
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:58,436
-The 1 6th?.
-Can you do it?

1526
03:09:58,600 --> 03:10:00,716
I'll give you a lot of money.

1527
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,833
-Artillery?.
-I can't.

1528
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:08,038
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1529
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:10,515
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1530
03:10:11,560 --> 03:10:13,596
Which I'm going to give them.

1531
03:10:14,360 --> 03:10:16,112
That's all I want.

1532
03:10:17,200 --> 03:10:20,078
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1533
03:10:20,320 --> 03:10:24,598
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1534
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:28,031
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1535
03:10:28,240 --> 03:10:30,629
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1536
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:32,199
Fair enough.

1537
03:10:32,720 --> 03:10:35,598
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1538
03:10:36,360 --> 03:10:38,271
It's going to happen.

1539
03:10:38,920 --> 03:10:41,036
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1540
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:43,432
All there is.

1541
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:45,558
Not that much.

1542
03:10:48,840 --> 03:10:51,593
The best of them
won't come for money.

1543
03:10:53,480 --> 03:10:54,913
They'll come for me.

1544
03:11:13,360 --> 03:11:14,634
No pictures!

1545
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:17,229
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

1546
03:11:17,480 --> 03:11:21,632
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1547
03:11:21,880 --> 03:11:24,155
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1548
03:11:28,600 --> 03:11:31,194
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back?.

1549
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:32,754
Yes.

1550
03:11:32,960 --> 03:11:35,315
-Changed, hasn't he?.
-No.

1551
03:11:35,480 --> 03:11:38,392
Oh, I'd sday he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1552
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:46,835
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1553
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:52,310
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1554
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,560
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?.

1555
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:58,512
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1556
03:11:58,720 --> 03:12:00,676
-I did.
-What did he say?

1557
03:12:00,920 --> 03:12:02,512
He laughed.

1558
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,639
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1559
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:07,713
He offered me money.

1560
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:09,558
Did you take it?

1561
03:12:10,360 --> 03:12:12,999
No. But many did.

1562
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:53,757
-What is this?
-This is my bodyguard.

1563
03:12:54,480 --> 03:12:57,119
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1564
03:12:57,400 --> 03:13:01,029
-There's a price on my head too.
-But these are murderers.

1565
03:13:01,240 --> 03:13:03,231
The sheiks will hang these men.

1566
03:13:03,480 --> 03:13:05,232
These men are mine.

1567
03:13:05,760 --> 03:13:10,072
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1568
03:13:10,400 --> 03:13:13,870
-You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
-Sherif?

1569
03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:17,072
-Where do we ride?
-Damascus, sherif.

1570
03:13:17,280 --> 03:13:19,191
Aye, but for what?

1571
03:13:19,440 --> 03:13:21,590
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1572
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:28,030
-You have bought these things.
-I bought half the men here, Ali.

1573
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:31,033
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1574
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:34,272
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1575
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:40,111
Damascus!

1576
03:13:40,320 --> 03:13:42,436
Damascus! Damascus!.

1577
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:45,712
Damascus! Damascus!.

1578
03:14:19,600 --> 03:14:23,149
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1579
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:27,069
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1580
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:30,955
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--

1581
03:14:31,120 --> 03:14:32,155
Certainly.

1582
03:14:32,320 --> 03:14:34,072
He can't be far from Mallud...

1583
03:14:34,720 --> 03:14:38,998
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1584
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:41,271
Splendid. Philip.

1585
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:44,353
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1586
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:48,155
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1587
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:52,310
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1588
03:14:52,480 --> 03:14:53,708
Any questions?.

1589
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:58,318
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consisdt of?

1590
03:14:58,800 --> 03:15:01,030
Irregular cavalry, sdir. About 2000.

1591
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:03,111
Where are they now?

1592
03:15:03,800 --> 03:15:08,669
-Can only know by being with them.
-Then get with them. I want to know.

1593
03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:11,315
Pound them, Charley.

1594
03:15:11,920 --> 03:15:13,319
Pound them.

1595
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:26,713
God help the men who lie under that.

1596
03:15:26,920 --> 03:15:28,558
They're Turks.

1597
03:15:28,760 --> 03:15:30,432
God help them.

1598
03:16:13,160 --> 03:16:16,914
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1599
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:18,474
Cocky?

1600
03:16:18,680 --> 03:16:20,432
More than cocky, sir.

1601
03:16:20,720 --> 03:16:24,076
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1602
03:16:24,280 --> 03:16:27,750
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1603
03:16:28,440 --> 03:16:30,271
-Unless....
-Unless?

1604
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:34,319
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1605
03:16:34,600 --> 03:16:37,558
-What do the Turks have in Mazril?
-A brigade, sir.

1606
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:42,795
I wonder where they are now.

1607
03:18:24,840 --> 03:18:25,989
No prisoners.

1608
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:31,590
Damascus, Lawrence.

1609
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:44,353
Lawrence, not this.

1610
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:49,073
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1611
03:18:49,840 --> 03:18:51,432
No prisoners.

1612
03:19:01,560 --> 03:19:03,152
This wasd T alaal's village.

1613
03:19:07,400 --> 03:19:09,391
Talaal!

1614
03:19:19,400 --> 03:19:20,594
Talaal!

1615
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:31,671
No prisoners!

1616
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:33,235
No prisoners!

1617
03:19:45,160 --> 03:19:46,434
God.

1618
03:19:50,200 --> 03:19:51,519
God.

1619
03:19:53,440 --> 03:19:54,793
God!.

1620
03:22:12,120 --> 03:22:15,271
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1621
03:23:52,680 --> 03:23:53,874
Major!.

1622
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:56,232
Major Lawrence!.

1623
03:24:01,880 --> 03:24:03,518
Jesusd wept.

1624
03:24:19,080 --> 03:24:20,354
Jesusd wept.

1625
03:24:22,240 --> 03:24:24,276
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1626
03:24:24,920 --> 03:24:27,718
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1627
03:24:27,920 --> 03:24:29,751
Barbarous and cruel.

1628
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:32,477
Who but they?

1629
03:24:32,880 --> 03:24:34,233
Who but they?

1630
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:38,915
Oh, you rotten man.

1631
03:24:39,960 --> 03:24:44,397
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1632
03:24:46,480 --> 03:24:48,596
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1633
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:18,595
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1634
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:20,718
Damascus!

1635
03:25:20,920 --> 03:25:22,797
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1636
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:24,433
Tell him.

1637
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:27,158
Remind him.

1638
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:31,117
-Is Allenby in Damascusd?
-Near.

1639
03:25:31,960 --> 03:25:34,235
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1640
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:37,311
They are not ripe.

1641
03:25:43,280 --> 03:25:45,316
General salute!.

1642
03:25:45,520 --> 03:25:50,196
Present arms!

1643
03:26:02,160 --> 03:26:03,991
Port arms!

1644
03:26:06,800 --> 03:26:08,677
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1645
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:11,758
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1646
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:19,877
-When?
-A day and a night, sdir.

1647
03:26:20,080 --> 03:26:21,991
They've been here a day and a night.

1648
03:26:22,200 --> 03:26:24,714
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1649
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:28,879
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1650
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:31,597
What else beside the town hall?

1651
03:26:31,880 --> 03:26:34,713
Telephone exchange,
posdt office, powerhousde...

1652
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,389
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1653
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:40,558
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1654
03:26:40,720 --> 03:26:42,392
...and they're in the town hall.

1655
03:26:42,680 --> 03:26:45,558
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1656
03:26:47,240 --> 03:26:48,719
What sdhould we do about it?

1657
03:26:48,920 --> 03:26:51,354
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1658
03:26:52,240 --> 03:26:54,071
How about that, Dryden?

1659
03:26:55,880 --> 03:26:58,553
Not unless you want
a full-sdcale rising.

1660
03:26:59,360 --> 03:27:02,397
-What, then?
-When will Feisdal be in Damascus?

1661
03:27:02,560 --> 03:27:04,630
By special train in two days' time.

1662
03:27:04,920 --> 03:27:06,194
Two days.

1663
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:09,750
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1664
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:12,076
-Isn't it enough?.
-Yes.

1665
03:27:12,240 --> 03:27:15,710
-Ample, I should think.
-We can't just do nothing.

1666
03:27:15,920 --> 03:27:19,595
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1667
03:27:19,840 --> 03:27:24,072
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1668
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:26,118
Does that apply to technical units?.

1669
03:27:26,400 --> 03:27:28,470
Technical units particularly.

1670
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:30,113
Yes, sdir.

1671
03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:32,119
Medicalsd too, sir?

1672
03:27:32,360 --> 03:27:34,555
I'm afraid sdo, Harry.

1673
03:27:34,920 --> 03:27:36,592
Medicals too.

1674
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:18,513
We here...

1675
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:21,638
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1676
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:24,991
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1677
03:28:25,320 --> 03:28:28,790
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1678
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:31,036
He insulted me.

1679
03:28:32,160 --> 03:28:36,278
Sherif Ali sdaid that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1680
03:28:36,520 --> 03:28:39,353
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1681
03:28:39,840 --> 03:28:43,549
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1682
03:28:43,800 --> 03:28:47,349
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1683
03:28:49,800 --> 03:28:52,155
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1684
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:56,510
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1685
03:28:59,240 --> 03:29:03,199
I asdk pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1686
03:29:03,440 --> 03:29:04,998
Humbly?

1687
03:29:05,160 --> 03:29:06,513
Humbly, Harith?.

1688
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:08,831
Yes, humbly.

1689
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:11,316
This is a new trick.

1690
03:29:12,320 --> 03:29:13,992
Why is there no electricity?.

1691
03:29:14,960 --> 03:29:17,713
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1692
03:29:17,960 --> 03:29:20,838
There are three large machinesd.

1693
03:29:21,040 --> 03:29:23,395
He means generators!.

1694
03:29:23,880 --> 03:29:25,029
So.

1695
03:29:25,520 --> 03:29:27,238
One of them is burning.

1696
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:30,552
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1697
03:29:30,880 --> 03:29:33,599
It is so of all machines.

1698
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:37,833
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1699
03:29:40,520 --> 03:29:43,671
-The need isd absolute.
-Then we need English engineers.

1700
03:29:43,920 --> 03:29:47,549
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1701
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:49,074
Take--

1702
03:29:53,200 --> 03:29:54,394
Fire has broken out.

1703
03:29:54,640 --> 03:29:56,198
-Where?
-The Jinsibi district.

1704
03:29:56,400 --> 03:29:59,278
-It is not a district that matters.
-It will spread!

1705
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:01,238
Then use the fire brigade!

1706
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:04,438
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1707
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:06,119
Then you must carry it.

1708
03:30:06,440 --> 03:30:10,752
-The Ruala do not carry water.
-What else are they good for?

1709
03:30:23,080 --> 03:30:26,595
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1710
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:31,158
This afternoon!

1711
03:30:54,920 --> 03:30:58,913
-I'll take this up after the war.
-Surely we should do something, sir.

1712
03:30:59,160 --> 03:31:03,119
-It's an old man's sport.
-Are you an old man, sir?

1713
03:31:03,320 --> 03:31:06,198
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsdibility.

1714
03:31:07,640 --> 03:31:08,993
Sorry, sdir.

1715
03:31:11,200 --> 03:31:12,872
Maybe it's the bulb.

1716
03:31:17,600 --> 03:31:18,715
No, sir.

1717
03:31:19,160 --> 03:31:20,832
It's the power.

1718
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:37,399
They're leaving.

1719
03:31:38,120 --> 03:31:39,792
That's it, then.

1720
03:31:40,320 --> 03:31:42,390
Marvellous-looking beggars,
aren't they?

1721
03:32:03,640 --> 03:32:06,518
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1722
03:32:06,760 --> 03:32:08,751
-Come where?
-Back.

1723
03:32:13,240 --> 03:32:15,435
I know your heart.

1724
03:32:23,880 --> 03:32:25,518
What is it?

1725
03:32:26,520 --> 03:32:28,192
Is it this?

1726
03:32:30,920 --> 03:32:34,037
I tell you, this is nothing.

1727
03:32:47,200 --> 03:32:48,872
Is it the blood?

1728
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:52,752
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1729
03:32:54,320 --> 03:32:58,677
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1730
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:01,079
Hear me, God.

1731
03:33:02,760 --> 03:33:06,594
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1732
03:33:23,440 --> 03:33:24,759
What about you?

1733
03:33:25,760 --> 03:33:29,309
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1734
03:33:31,840 --> 03:33:33,239
A very low occupation.

1735
03:33:33,760 --> 03:33:36,797
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1736
03:33:45,760 --> 03:33:48,638
You have tried very hard
to give us Damasdcus.

1737
03:33:48,840 --> 03:33:50,751
It's what I came for.

1738
03:33:54,280 --> 03:33:55,508
And then...

1739
03:33:57,960 --> 03:33:59,313
...it would be sdomething.

1740
03:33:59,520 --> 03:34:00,794
Yes.

1741
03:34:01,440 --> 03:34:02,668
Much.

1742
03:34:21,680 --> 03:34:24,148
-He is your friend?.
-Take your hand away.

1743
03:34:24,360 --> 03:34:25,634
-You love him.
-I fear him.

1744
03:34:25,840 --> 03:34:27,671
Then why do you weep?

1745
03:34:28,040 --> 03:34:30,190
If I fear him, who love him...

1746
03:34:30,360 --> 03:34:33,318
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1747
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:36,831
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1748
03:34:39,200 --> 03:34:42,510
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1749
03:34:42,720 --> 03:34:43,789
Not yet.

1750
03:34:44,040 --> 03:34:48,352
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1751
03:34:48,920 --> 03:34:50,831
And Allah be thanked.

1752
03:34:51,320 --> 03:34:52,719
I'Il tell thee what...

1753
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:56,356
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1754
03:35:17,840 --> 03:35:21,116
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1755
03:35:21,400 --> 03:35:24,233
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1756
03:35:24,440 --> 03:35:28,831
Under the circumstances, I think
I musdt take over. Immediately.

1757
03:35:29,080 --> 03:35:32,072
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1758
03:35:32,360 --> 03:35:33,918
No, sir, I will not.

1759
03:35:34,880 --> 03:35:36,472
Control yourself.

1760
03:35:36,960 --> 03:35:40,077
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1761
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:43,349
We did what we could
in the civic hospitalsd.

1762
03:35:43,560 --> 03:35:46,393
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1763
03:35:46,760 --> 03:35:51,231
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1764
03:35:51,880 --> 03:35:56,476
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1765
03:36:03,240 --> 03:36:04,673
What's it like?.

1766
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:23,556
This is outrageous!

1767
03:37:24,680 --> 03:37:26,557
Outrageousd!

1768
03:37:29,840 --> 03:37:31,512
Outrageousd!

1769
03:37:32,680 --> 03:37:34,875
You filthy little wog!

1770
03:37:45,400 --> 03:37:49,473
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1771
03:37:49,720 --> 03:37:52,188
"My friend Lawrence."

1772
03:37:52,400 --> 03:37:57,030
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1773
03:37:57,240 --> 03:37:59,913
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1774
03:38:00,120 --> 03:38:05,240
He pines for the Gothic cottagesd
of Surrey, is it not?

1775
03:38:05,480 --> 03:38:09,075
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1776
03:38:09,360 --> 03:38:12,875
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1777
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:16,595
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1778
03:38:17,520 --> 03:38:19,715
You're promoted colonel.

1779
03:38:19,920 --> 03:38:22,388
Yes. What for?

1780
03:38:22,600 --> 03:38:25,751
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a Iittle kind.

1781
03:38:26,000 --> 03:38:30,073
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1782
03:38:30,720 --> 03:38:32,995
Then, thank you.

1783
03:38:37,240 --> 03:38:38,434
Well, then...

1784
03:38:39,080 --> 03:38:40,115
...Godspeed.

1785
03:38:40,600 --> 03:38:44,513
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1786
03:38:44,760 --> 03:38:48,912
We drive bargainsd. Old men's work.

1787
03:38:49,120 --> 03:38:51,429
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

1788
03:38:51,600 --> 03:38:53,511
...are the virtues of young men.

1789
03:38:53,800 --> 03:38:57,236
Courage and hope for the future.

1790
03:38:57,440 --> 03:39:00,113
Then old men make the peace.

1791
03:39:01,240 --> 03:39:04,118
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1792
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:06,794
Mistrust and caution.

1793
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:09,591
It must be so.

1794
03:39:26,000 --> 03:39:30,596
What I owe you isd beyond evaluation.

1795
03:39:40,320 --> 03:39:43,995
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1796
03:39:44,280 --> 03:39:45,998
The pumping plant I must retain.

1797
03:39:46,200 --> 03:39:48,794
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1798
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:52,709
-I shall be glad of assistance.
-Then you must bring down your flag.

1799
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:56,834
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1800
03:39:57,160 --> 03:39:58,798
-Have you men?.
-Enough for that.

1801
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,389
It's a thing that
makesd an ugly incident.

1802
03:40:01,720 --> 03:40:03,597
I'm sure your government...

1803
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:07,674
...does not wisdh to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

1804
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:11,479
I say!

1805
03:40:12,880 --> 03:40:14,836
It's Lawrence, isn't it?.

1806
03:40:17,160 --> 03:40:19,355
May I shake your hand, sir?

1807
03:40:20,560 --> 03:40:23,154
Just want to be able
to sday I'd done it, sir.

1808
03:40:26,760 --> 03:40:28,990
Haven't we met before?.

1809
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:30,838
Don't think so, sir.

1810
03:40:31,040 --> 03:40:33,759
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1811
03:40:39,000 --> 03:40:43,198
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1812
03:40:43,400 --> 03:40:45,391
They have no power. It's illusory.

1813
03:40:45,640 --> 03:40:48,074
Illusionsd can be very powerful.

1814
03:40:48,440 --> 03:40:50,078
Particularly...

1815
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:53,554
...when they take this form.

1816
03:40:55,760 --> 03:40:58,752
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damasdcus...

1817
03:40:58,960 --> 03:41:00,916
...Iiberated by the Arab army.

1818
03:41:01,440 --> 03:41:04,557
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1819
03:41:05,080 --> 03:41:10,074
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1820
03:41:10,400 --> 03:41:13,437
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?.

1821
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:19,270
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1822
03:41:20,120 --> 03:41:22,395
You are merely a general.

1823
03:41:24,920 --> 03:41:26,433
I musdt be a king.

1824
03:41:29,440 --> 03:41:31,317
Excuse me, sir.

1825
03:41:45,960 --> 03:41:47,234
Well?

1826
03:41:48,120 --> 03:41:49,519
Well...

1827
03:41:49,960 --> 03:41:52,838
...it sdeems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1828
03:41:53,080 --> 03:41:55,310
...with an Arab flag on it.

1829
03:41:55,520 --> 03:41:57,476
Do you think it wasd worth it?.

1830
03:41:57,640 --> 03:42:00,313
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a sdoldier.

1831
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:01,789
Yes, sdir.

1832
03:42:02,120 --> 03:42:03,712
So you keep saying.

1833
03:42:03,920 --> 03:42:05,512
You, I suspect...

1834
03:42:06,040 --> 03:42:09,953
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1835
03:42:10,360 --> 03:42:13,477
-What do you think?
-Me, Your Highness?

1836
03:42:14,160 --> 03:42:18,438
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1837
03:42:56,480 --> 03:42:59,517
Well, sir. Going home.

1838
03:43:01,880 --> 03:43:03,518
Home, sir.

1839
03:43:05,880 --> 03:43:33,965
