1
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:29,008
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,200
Did you know him well?

3
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,002
I knew him.

4
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,923
Well, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,006
But did he really deserve...

6
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,404
...a place in here?

7
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,522
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,646
What, more words?

9
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:04,200
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,924
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:10,808
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,198
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,206
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,048
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,803
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,241
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:32,478
Thank you.

18
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,205
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,241
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,605
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:45,843
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,239
-He was a great man.
-Did you know him?

23
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,400
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,998
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:54,807
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,325
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,802
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:22,200
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:23,438
That's right.

30
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,805
We are not happy in it.

31
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,718
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,200
-Then you're a big noble fellow.
-That's right.

33
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:38,204
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,799
-Here you are, Tosh.
-Thanks.

35
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,807
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,439
-Is it there?
-Of course.

37
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,202
Headlines.

38
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,806
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:59,607
" Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:04,038
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,804
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:12,205
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes.

43
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,604
-Flimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

44
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,520
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,408
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,406
And you're balmy!

47
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,802
-It damn well hurts!
-Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,802
What's the trick, then?

49
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:51,922
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,002
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,400
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,205
-He's balmy.
-He's all right.

53
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,322
Lawrence.

54
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,238
Yes?

55
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:13,207
You're supposed to be....

56
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,878
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,718
Always.

58
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:20,045
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,598
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,640
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,245
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,798
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,442
Where are you going?

64
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,001
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:39,928
-Sorry.
-You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,400
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:46,918
Sorry.

68
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,600
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:52,926
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,525
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,886
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss.

72
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,361
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,042
There is, indeed.

74
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,120
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,327
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,002
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:15,201
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:18,082
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,807
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,001
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,040
...giving military advice.

82
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,120
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:33,920
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to....

84
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:34,925
To what?

85
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,524
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,643
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,562
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,039
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,042
They did attack Medina.

90
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:52,519
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.

91
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,043
We don't know that.

92
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,561
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,043
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:06,526
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:09,442
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,998
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,723
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:17,483
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,721
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:26,247
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:31,199
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,004
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,805
-Lawrence, sir.
-Send him in.

104
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:39,804
Good morning, sir.

105
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,402
Salute.

106
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,720
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,641
-It's my manner.
-Your what?

108
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,642
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,678
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,807
-I have the same problem, sir.
-Shut up.

111
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,280
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:04,122
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,678
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:11,607
" I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,925
-What?
-Themistocles, sir.

116
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,605
-A Greek philosopher.
-I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,999
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,167
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:29,405
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,648
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:36,205
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,408
Yes, what is it?

123
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:42,243
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,400
-Is that certain?
-Yes, sir.

125
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:47,519
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:50,408
But there must be artillery!

127
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,445
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,682
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,397
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,609
-Two months, then.
-Three.

131
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,008
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:12,807
Thank you, sir.

133
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,400
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am gratef ul for this.

134
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,446
Shut up and get out.

135
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:27,608
Sir?

136
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:36,126
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,843
-How did you do it?
-Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,445
-Because I'm the man for the job.
-I just wonder about that.

139
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,442
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,327
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:51,321
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,404
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,198
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:01,843
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:06,207
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:10,802
That's new.

147
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:13,608
Where are they now?

148
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,607
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,242
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:22,004
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:24,126
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,404
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,005
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither.
Take it from me.

154
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:35,400
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,198
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:46,046
It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:00,607
Here you may drink.

158
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,397
One cup.

159
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,402
You do not drink?

160
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:15,998
No.

161
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,001
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:20,924
I am Bedu.

163
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,448
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,008
Yes.

165
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,202
From Cairo?

166
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,008
Yes.

167
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:29,601
-You did not ride from Cairo?
-No.

168
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,598
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:35,602
And before?

170
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,603
From Britain?

171
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,208
Yes.

172
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:42,808
Truly?

173
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,642
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,008
Is that a desert country?

175
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:53,121
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,804
You are not fat?

177
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:57,604
No.

178
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,602
I'm different.

179
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:28,808
Here...

180
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:31,002
...take it.

181
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,119
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:36,802
Take it now.

183
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,207
Bedu food.

184
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,208
Good.

185
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:13,598
More?

186
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,605
-Bedu.
-Where?

187
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:25,203
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:26,598
Yes, I know.

189
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,640
-I am not Harith.
-No.

190
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,403
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:09,440
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:11,202
When you are ready to go...

193
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:14,407
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, " Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:34,844
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:54,559
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:58,239
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:59,604
Now!

198
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:58,397
Good?

199
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,401
It's all right.

200
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:03,605
This is a Harith well.

201
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,398
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,008
Turks?

203
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:52,478
Bedu.

204
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,807
Who is he?

205
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,802
He is dead.

206
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:33,602
Yes.

207
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:35,884
Why?

208
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:40,002
This my well.

209
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,127
I have drunk from it.

210
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,721
You are welcome.

211
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:48,637
He was my friend.

212
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:51,608
-That?
-Yes, that.

213
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:04,406
-This pistol yours?
-No, his.

214
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:21,603
His?

215
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:23,403
Mine.

216
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,801
Then I will use it.

217
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,519
Your friend...

218
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:39,605
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,202
I know.

220
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:49,677
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,168
I have heard of you.

222
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,401
So...

223
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,446
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,999
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,799
-You've been sent from Cairo.
-Yes.

226
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:11,599
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:14,798
I can both read and write.

228
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:22,197
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,207
What is your name?

230
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:27,603
My name is for my friends.

231
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:34,845
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:38,640
You are angry, English.

233
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:48,807
He was nothing.

234
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:50,807
The well is everything.

235
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:54,607
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:56,407
He knew that.

237
00:27:58,649 --> 00:27:59,798
Salaam.

238
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:02,881
Sherif Ali.

239
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,207
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,838
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,408
...a silly people.

242
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,928
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,478
Come.

244
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,002
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:34,200
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:37,600
Wadi Saf ra is another day from here.

247
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:40,847
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,800
I will find it with this.

249
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:55,000
Good army compass.

250
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,400
How if I take it?

251
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,043
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,488
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:04,803
My fear is my concern.

254
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:06,608
Truly.

255
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,405
God be with you, English.

256
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:01,725
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air

257
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:03,760
You can hear the girls declare

258
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:06,728
He must be a millionaire

259
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:30,166
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo

260
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:49,327
Hey, you!

261
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:09,961
-I've been waiting for you.
-Did you know I was coming?

262
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:12,359
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

263
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:13,928
How did he know?

264
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,922
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

265
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,125
I'll give him that. No escort?

266
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,718
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

267
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:24,727
-Turks?
-No, an Arab.

268
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:27,324
Bloody savages.

269
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:31,967
-This is Wadi Saf ra, isn't it?
-Yes, they're over there.

270
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:34,643
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

271
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:38,723
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

272
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:43,519
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

273
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:48,519
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

274
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:52,918
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awf ul.

275
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:56,161
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

276
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:00,243
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

277
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:02,764
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

278
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:04,567
What I want to say is this:

279
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:07,323
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

280
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,326
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

281
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:13,124
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

282
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:17,117
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-I understand what you're saying.

283
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,127
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

284
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,321
Oh, my God.

285
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,727
Not again.

286
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:57,446
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

287
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:00,726
" Move South, " I've said.
"You're still in range."

288
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:05,925
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

289
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,645
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

290
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:40,922
Fire back at them.

291
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:53,001
-Who are you?
-Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

292
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:54,841
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

293
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:58,206
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

294
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:00,724
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

295
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,722
You were right and I was wrong.

296
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,960
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

297
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:09,326
-We can take care of them at Yenbo.
-lf they can get to Yenbo.

298
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:11,008
They can hardly come with us.

299
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:15,367
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

300
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:17,358
Lawrence.

301
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:19,918
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence...

302
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:24,998
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

303
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:29,317
First the guns, and now this.

304
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:22,917
Cigarette?

305
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:24,528
I'm sorry.

306
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:36,640
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

307
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,803
Umph off.

308
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:42,328
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

309
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,404
Hold it, Jenkins!

310
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:05,922
Jenkins!

311
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,527
Lawrence?

312
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,128
You have no servant.

313
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:22,758
-I don't need a servant.
-No?

314
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:26,558
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

315
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,720
-Yes, everything.
-I don't doubt it.

316
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:31,927
-It will be very nice for you.
-I can't afford it.

317
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:58,321
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

318
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,084
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

319
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:08,123
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

320
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:13,448
Others do battle in His cause.

321
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:17,841
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

322
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:21,128
And observe the prayers.

323
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:27,488
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

324
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:32,318
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

325
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:37,924
Verily, God is forgiving, mercif ul--

326
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:39,522
Greetings, Ali.

327
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:41,447
-My lord.
-Sherif Ali.

328
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:45,728
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

329
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:48,321
Yes, my lord.

330
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,924
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

331
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:55,359
" By the noonday brightness...

332
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:57,645
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

333
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:00,198
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

334
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:02,758
...neither hath He been displeased.

335
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:07,127
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

336
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:10,725
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

337
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,124
...and thou be satisfied."

338
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:16,328
So?

339
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:19,358
Yes, colonel.

340
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:23,318
-I want a decision, sir.
-You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

341
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,129
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

342
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,083
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

343
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,206
You could supply us through Aqaba!

344
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:34,122
Aqaba!

345
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,449
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

346
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:39,560
-But you can't!
-You could.

347
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:42,523
You mean, the navy?

348
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:46,566
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

349
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,720
Can you imagine what that means?

350
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,607
Yes, I can imagine.

351
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:54,848
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

352
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:57,483
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

353
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:01,724
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

354
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,681
You can see that, sir, surely.

355
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:06,722
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

356
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:08,885
It is of little consequence to us.

357
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,325
I must ask you not to speak like that.

358
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:14,083
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

359
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,001
Possibly.

360
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:20,764
Upon my word, sir, you're ungratef ul.

361
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:23,523
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

362
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:25,845
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

363
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,842
-Guns?
-A modern rifle for every man.

364
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:31,842
No. Guns. Artillery.

365
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:35,206
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

366
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:38,367
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

367
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:42,124
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

368
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:43,961
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

369
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:48,122
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanized army.

370
00:40:49,729 --> 00:40:53,688
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

371
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:00,088
I think it is far from Damascus.

372
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:03,560
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

373
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:06,642
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

374
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:08,562
Yes, my lord.

375
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,127
It is beautif ul, is it not?

376
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,007
-Very.
-That will do, Lawrence.

377
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:17,162
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

378
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:22,244
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

379
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:24,684
Small population compared with some.

380
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,926
It's small, but it's great. And why?

381
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,888
-Because it has guns.
-Because it has discipline.

382
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:35,122
Because it has a navy, because of this,
the English go where they please...

383
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,837
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

384
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,120
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

385
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:42,519
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

386
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,760
But I would like to hear his opinion.

387
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:47,325
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

388
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,845
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

389
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:56,117
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

390
00:41:57,209 --> 00:42:00,724
My lord, I think....

391
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:03,725
I think your book is right.

392
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:08,241
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

393
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:12,038
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they
please and strike where they please.

394
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:14,439
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

395
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:17,487
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

396
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:19,765
And this is the way you should
fight now.

397
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:21,522
I don't know.

398
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:23,919
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

399
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:28,647
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

400
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:30,959
-What is this to you?
-You're a traitor.

401
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:33,165
No, colonel.

402
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:36,526
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

403
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:39,727
They must say their say.

404
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:45,599
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

405
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,243
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

406
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:50,923
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

407
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:54,720
You tread heavily...

408
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:58,329
...but you speak the truth.

409
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:03,245
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

410
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:05,327
...it is late.

411
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:25,722
Colonel Brighton means to put my men
under European officers, does he not?

412
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,766
In effect, my lord, yes.

413
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:29,920
And I must do it...

414
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:34,124
...because the Turks have
European guns.

415
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,929
But I fear to do it...

416
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:39,919
...upon my soul I do.

417
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:45,768
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

418
00:43:46,009 --> 00:43:49,046
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

419
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:51,120
Then you must deny it to them.

420
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:54,805
You are an Englishman.
Are you not Ioyal to England?

421
00:43:55,409 --> 00:43:58,207
To England and to other things.

422
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:00,957
To England and Arabia both?

423
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:02,927
And is that possible?

424
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:13,448
I think you are another of these
desert-Ioving English.

425
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:15,725
Doughty, Stanhope...

426
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,519
...Gordon of Khartoum.

427
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:20,924
No Arab loves the desert.

428
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:25,924
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

429
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:29,324
And no man needs nothing.

430
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:35,759
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

431
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,445
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

432
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:43,728
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

433
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:47,160
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

434
00:44:47,409 --> 00:44:49,764
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

435
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:51,647
...when London was a village.

436
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,562
Yes, you were great.

437
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:56,845
Nine centuries ago.

438
00:44:57,089 --> 00:44:59,159
Time to be great again, my lord.

439
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:02,526
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

440
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:06,364
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

441
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:09,719
But my father is old...

442
00:45:10,689 --> 00:45:12,327
...and I...

443
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:17,524
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

444
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:22,122
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

445
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:27,118
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

446
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:28,358
...or....

447
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:29,928
Or?

448
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:33,924
What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence.

449
00:45:34,169 --> 00:45:36,524
We need a miracle.

450
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,198
Aqaba.

451
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:39,922
Aqaba.

452
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:42,287
From the land.

453
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:44,927
You are mad.

454
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:49,521
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nef ud Desert.

455
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:50,923
That's right.

456
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:53,325
The Nef ud cannot be crossed.

457
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:55,326
I'll cross it if you will.

458
00:48:55,529 --> 00:48:59,522
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

459
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:02,442
The Nef ud is the worst place
God created.

460
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:06,523
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

461
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:08,362
Fifty men?

462
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:11,043
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

463
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:13,564
If 50 men came out of the Nef ud...

464
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:16,721
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

465
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:19,719
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

466
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:22,921
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

467
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,319
-Good fighters, though.
-Good--

468
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:29,520
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

469
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:33,728
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

470
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,524
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

471
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:42,559
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

472
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:45,323
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

473
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:50,520
Aqaba's over there.

474
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:55,125
It's only a matter of going.

475
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:58,439
You are mad.

476
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:07,723
And where are you going, lieutenant?

477
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,965
With 50 of my men.

478
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:13,683
To work your miracle.

479
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:18,127
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

480
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:21,277
-Who told you?
-Ali did.

481
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:23,127
Why not you?

482
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,567
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

483
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:29,959
Yes, I must.

484
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:33,121
But I will spare these to you.

485
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:37,927
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

486
00:50:38,529 --> 00:50:42,317
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

487
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:45,598
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

488
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:46,838
No.

489
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:00,120
Since you do know...

490
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:03,999
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

491
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:07,526
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

492
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:11,327
But in whose name do you ride?

493
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:36,363
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

494
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:38,725
They were here. I caught them.

495
00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:41,727
Why are you here? Boy!

496
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:43,760
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

497
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:46,523
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

498
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:48,521
You have been tracking us.

499
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:51,319
-You were told to stay.
-No, sherif.

500
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:53,525
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

501
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:56,567
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

502
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:59,323
-It is the will of Allah.
-Blasphemy.

503
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:00,757
Don't do that.

504
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:05,725
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

505
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:08,923
Be warned. They are not suitable.

506
00:54:09,129 --> 00:54:12,758
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

507
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:17,605
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

508
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:24,162
One shilling, every week?

509
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:25,922
That is fair.

510
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:27,837
-Each?
-No.

511
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:29,602
-That is too much.
-All right.

512
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:41,882
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

513
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,927
There is the railway.

514
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:00,562
And that is the desert.

515
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:05,518
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

516
00:55:05,729 --> 00:55:08,880
For the camels, no water at all.

517
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:11,525
If the camels die...

518
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,128
...we die.

519
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:17,728
And in 20 days they will start to die.

520
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:26,126
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

521
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,607
I was thinking.

522
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,487
You were drifting.

523
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:00,884
Yes. It will not happen again.

524
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:04,684
Be warned, you were drifting.

525
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:07,285
It will not happen again.

526
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:08,680
That water is wasted.

527
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:16,084
From now on,
we must travel by night...

528
00:59:16,329 --> 00:59:19,127
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

529
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:21,678
A few hours each day.

530
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:25,280
Why don't we start now?

531
00:59:25,489 --> 00:59:28,083
No. We will rest now.

532
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:30,918
Three hours.

533
00:59:31,169 --> 00:59:32,488
Fine.

534
00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:34,488
I'll wake you.

535
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:48,808
Do we rest here?

536
01:01:49,049 --> 01:01:52,086
There is no rest now short of water.

537
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:54,280
The other side of that.

538
01:01:55,369 --> 01:01:57,485
And how much of that is there?

539
01:01:57,769 --> 01:01:59,282
I'm not sure.

540
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:04,487
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

541
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:07,685
This is the sun's anvil.

542
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:37,723
Have we done it?

543
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:40,921
No, but we're off the anvil.

544
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:43,282
Thank God for that anyway.

545
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:45,286
Yes, thank Him.

546
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:49,005
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.

547
01:03:49,249 --> 01:03:50,477
I know.

548
01:03:53,689 --> 01:03:55,122
We've done it.

549
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:56,882
God willing.

550
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:00,885
When do we reach the wells?

551
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:04,286
God willing, midday.

552
01:04:04,769 --> 01:04:08,000
-Then we've done it.
-Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

553
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:13,082
Gasim's.

554
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:18,487
What's happened to him?

555
01:04:19,249 --> 01:04:20,682
God knows.

556
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:24,080
Why don't you stop?

557
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:27,885
For what? He will be dead by midday.

558
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,687
We must go back.

559
01:04:34,929 --> 01:04:37,682
What for, to die with Gasim?

560
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:41,079
In one hour comes the sun.

561
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:47,000
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

562
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:48,477
I can.

563
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:50,881
Take the boys.

564
01:04:56,529 --> 01:04:58,884
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

565
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:01,284
Gasim you have killed already.

566
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:03,043
Get out of my way.

567
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:07,078
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

568
01:05:07,289 --> 01:05:08,563
Nothing is written!

569
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:12,922
Go back, then!

570
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:16,480
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

571
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:19,286
English blasphemer!

572
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:21,887
Aqaba?

573
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:24,087
Was it Aqaba?

574
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:27,483
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

575
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,007
Go back, blasphemer...

576
01:05:31,569 --> 01:05:33,446
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

577
01:05:33,849 --> 01:05:35,487
I shall be at Aqaba.

578
01:05:35,729 --> 01:05:37,685
That is written.

579
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:39,477
In here.

580
01:05:48,969 --> 01:05:50,687
English!

581
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:52,481
English!

582
01:12:09,489 --> 01:12:12,287
Lawrence! Daud!

583
01:14:15,449 --> 01:14:17,485
Nothing is written.

584
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:49,882
Al Lawrence.

585
01:14:54,129 --> 01:14:55,482
Farraj.

586
01:14:56,569 --> 01:14:57,684
Wash.

587
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:35,007
Al Lawrence.

588
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:39,886
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

589
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:47,207
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

590
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:50,043
-AI Lawrence is better.
-True.

591
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:54,483
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

592
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:03,208
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

593
01:16:03,449 --> 01:16:06,088
-Is that a lord?
-A kind of lord.

594
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:09,088
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

595
01:16:09,289 --> 01:16:10,483
No.

596
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,241
You have an elder brother.

597
01:16:15,769 --> 01:16:20,684
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:16:22,169 --> 01:16:24,000
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:27,081
I see.

600
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:28,888
I'm sorry.

601
01:16:30,769 --> 01:16:34,523
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

602
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:39,403
Yes, I suppose I am.

603
01:16:40,689 --> 01:16:42,327
Al Lawrence is best.

604
01:16:45,169 --> 01:16:49,082
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

605
01:17:17,569 --> 01:17:20,481
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,287
Very fine.

607
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:40,128
-Great honour.
-The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:42,678
-Is it permitted?
-Surely.

609
01:17:47,649 --> 01:17:52,484
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

610
01:18:00,169 --> 01:18:03,320
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:19:50,849 --> 01:19:52,441
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:55,282
As you see.

613
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:57,518
Are you alone?

614
01:19:57,969 --> 01:19:59,482
Almost.

615
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:10,124
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

616
01:20:10,369 --> 01:20:11,688
Yours?

617
01:20:15,169 --> 01:20:16,887
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:21,288
I've heard of another man
of that name.

619
01:20:22,169 --> 01:20:23,807
Other? What other?

620
01:20:24,129 --> 01:20:28,168
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:20:31,569 --> 01:20:33,605
He must be a great hero.

622
01:20:33,849 --> 01:20:35,487
He is.

623
01:20:35,689 --> 01:20:38,726
He wouldn't ref use water to men coming
out of Nef ud Desert.

624
01:20:39,089 --> 01:20:41,080
Now, would he not?

625
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:46,288
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:50,480
Here is my help.

627
01:21:15,129 --> 01:21:17,689
Son, what fashion is this?

628
01:21:18,969 --> 01:21:22,484
-Harith, Father.
-What manner of Harith?

629
01:21:23,089 --> 01:21:24,363
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:21:25,289 --> 01:21:26,722
And is he Harith?

631
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,085
No, Father, English.

632
01:21:32,169 --> 01:21:33,488
Son...

633
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,280
...they are stealing our water.

634
01:21:37,169 --> 01:21:38,887
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:21:39,649 --> 01:21:40,684
Tell them.

636
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:49,361
-Empty that!
-Do not!

637
01:22:51,529 --> 01:22:53,645
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,325
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

639
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:13,077
Harith.

640
01:23:13,969 --> 01:23:15,084
Ali.

641
01:23:15,769 --> 01:23:17,885
Does your father still steal?

642
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:21,078
No.

643
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:25,482
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

644
01:23:26,649 --> 01:23:29,686
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:23:30,529 --> 01:23:32,804
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:23:33,249 --> 01:23:36,047
-Auda flatters me.
-You are easily flattered.

647
01:23:36,569 --> 01:23:38,878
I knew your father well.

648
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:41,081
Did you know your own?

649
01:23:44,289 --> 01:23:48,840
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

650
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:52,287
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

651
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,441
-Do you desire it?
-Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:23:56,929 --> 01:23:59,887
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

653
01:24:02,889 --> 01:24:04,004
Call off your men.

654
01:24:09,369 --> 01:24:11,883
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:24:12,169 --> 01:24:14,205
I've only just begun to teach him.

656
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:18,522
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

657
01:24:18,769 --> 01:24:20,680
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:25,480
-Who is he?
-A friend of Prince Feisal's.

659
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:37,606
-So you desire my hospitality?
-Yes.

660
01:24:37,849 --> 01:24:39,282
Is he your tongue?

661
01:24:39,969 --> 01:24:41,687
We do desire it.

662
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:47,687
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:50,921
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:55,685
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:24:56,449 --> 01:25:00,681
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the Turks
to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,083
But...

667
01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:04,797
...dine with me.

668
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:07,522
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:10,718
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:25:11,489 --> 01:25:16,040
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:27:49,169 --> 01:27:52,684
This thing you work against Aqaba...

672
01:27:53,049 --> 01:27:55,324
...what profit do you hope from it?

673
01:27:55,529 --> 01:27:58,043
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:27:58,249 --> 01:28:00,285
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,958
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:28:05,449 --> 01:28:07,883
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

677
01:28:08,169 --> 01:28:10,922
But I....
I cannot serve.

678
01:28:11,769 --> 01:28:14,681
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

679
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,845
Yes, it is my pleasure.

680
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:24,959
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:28:25,449 --> 01:28:26,438
No?

682
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:30,009
-For the English, then?
-For the Arabs.

683
01:28:30,569 --> 01:28:31,968
The Arabs?

684
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:36,847
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:28:37,049 --> 01:28:38,960
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:28:39,609 --> 01:28:41,042
But the Arabs?

687
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:43,565
What tribe is that?

688
01:28:45,169 --> 01:28:49,162
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

689
01:28:49,369 --> 01:28:51,325
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:28:51,529 --> 01:28:53,360
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:55,799
Who work only for profit.

692
01:28:56,009 --> 01:28:57,601
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:28:57,809 --> 01:29:00,323
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

694
01:29:00,529 --> 01:29:01,644
Serve?

695
01:29:02,049 --> 01:29:03,084
I serve?

696
01:29:03,289 --> 01:29:05,849
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,567
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

698
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:14,567
-Does Auda serve?
-No!

699
01:29:14,769 --> 01:29:17,806
-Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
-No!

700
01:29:22,249 --> 01:29:26,208
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

701
01:29:26,649 --> 01:29:30,005
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

702
01:29:30,209 --> 01:29:34,202
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:38,368
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

704
01:29:38,569 --> 01:29:42,562
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:52,044
Is that service?

706
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:53,763
No.

707
01:30:00,249 --> 01:30:03,605
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

708
01:30:03,809 --> 01:30:06,403
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:10,602
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

710
01:30:10,809 --> 01:30:14,404
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:16,327
Why should they wish to?

712
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:19,438
Now....

713
01:30:20,009 --> 01:30:24,048
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:30:24,249 --> 01:30:26,399
...a servant's wages.

715
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:30,443
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:30:30,649 --> 01:30:34,562
...100 golden guineas.

717
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:38,766
150, Auda.

718
01:30:38,969 --> 01:30:41,767
-Who told you that?
-I have long ears.

719
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:44,164
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:30:44,369 --> 01:30:47,600
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

721
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:51,438
A trifle which they take
f rom a great box they have.

722
01:30:51,649 --> 01:30:53,560
In Aqaba.

723
01:30:54,769 --> 01:30:57,363
-In Aqaba?
-Where else?

724
01:30:58,209 --> 01:31:00,962
You trouble me like women.

725
01:31:01,329 --> 01:31:04,366
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda won't come to Aqaba.

726
01:31:05,009 --> 01:31:06,078
-For money?
-No.

727
01:31:06,449 --> 01:31:07,564
-For Feisal?
-No!

728
01:31:07,769 --> 01:31:10,681
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:13,246
He will come...

730
01:31:14,129 --> 01:31:16,359
...because it is his pleasure.

731
01:31:18,249 --> 01:31:21,764
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:31:23,129 --> 01:31:26,405
Make God your agent!

733
01:31:27,729 --> 01:31:29,799
Aqaba!

734
01:31:30,009 --> 01:31:31,601
Aqaba!

735
01:31:46,649 --> 01:31:48,560
God be with you.

736
01:31:51,409 --> 01:31:53,001
God be with you.

737
01:32:05,929 --> 01:32:08,363
God be with you.

738
01:32:08,769 --> 01:32:10,760
God be with you.

739
01:34:59,129 --> 01:35:00,528
Yes.

740
01:35:00,809 --> 01:35:01,844
Aqaba.

741
01:35:03,409 --> 01:35:05,969
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:35:07,129 --> 01:35:09,927
-Do you think we shall?
-Yes.

743
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:12,768
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:35:39,529 --> 01:35:42,168
He killed. He dies.

745
01:35:42,849 --> 01:35:44,965
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:35:47,529 --> 01:35:50,441
-One of our men murdered Auda's man.
-Why?

747
01:35:50,649 --> 01:35:53,561
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

748
01:35:54,009 --> 01:35:55,158
Ali!

749
01:35:55,569 --> 01:35:57,321
It is an ancient wound.

750
01:35:57,529 --> 01:36:00,362
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

751
01:36:04,649 --> 01:36:06,719
It is the law, Lawrence.

752
01:36:06,929 --> 01:36:09,124
The law says the man must die.

753
01:36:10,049 --> 01:36:12,961
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

754
01:36:13,929 --> 01:36:15,157
Yes.

755
01:36:18,489 --> 01:36:20,002
Sherif Ali!

756
01:36:20,209 --> 01:36:23,042
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

757
01:36:23,449 --> 01:36:26,521
-...will that content the Harith?
-Yes.

758
01:36:32,449 --> 01:36:34,963
Then I will execute the law.

759
01:36:35,929 --> 01:36:37,965
I have no tribe.

760
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:41,364
And no one is offended.

761
01:36:53,289 --> 01:36:54,278
Gasim.

762
01:36:58,569 --> 01:36:59,968
Did you do it?

763
01:37:25,809 --> 01:37:27,367
Well, Lawrence....

764
01:37:34,569 --> 01:37:35,922
What ails the Englishman?

765
01:37:36,129 --> 01:37:39,439
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nef ud.

766
01:37:39,649 --> 01:37:41,560
It was written, then.

767
01:37:42,369 --> 01:37:44,280
Better to have left him.

768
01:37:47,809 --> 01:37:50,960
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

769
01:37:51,369 --> 01:37:53,564
Besides, it was necessary.

770
01:37:54,569 --> 01:37:56,719
You gave life and you took it.

771
01:37:57,249 --> 01:37:58,762
The writing is still yours.

772
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:36,445
Auda Abu Tayi!

773
01:41:50,449 --> 01:41:52,565
The miracle is accomplished.

774
01:41:53,529 --> 01:41:55,087
Garlands for the conqueror.

775
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:12,093
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

776
01:42:12,856 --> 01:42:14,494
I'm none of those things, Ali.

777
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:17,256
-What, then?
-Don't know.

778
01:42:18,256 --> 01:42:19,484
Thanks.

779
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:23,052
My God, I love this country.

780
01:42:24,656 --> 01:42:25,645
What!

781
01:42:26,656 --> 01:42:28,453
No gold in Aqaba!

782
01:42:29,736 --> 01:42:32,045
Auda, I found it!

783
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,454
That's a pity.

784
01:42:45,856 --> 01:42:48,290
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

785
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:50,885
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

786
01:42:51,096 --> 01:42:54,133
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

787
01:42:54,336 --> 01:42:55,451
And you?

788
01:42:56,216 --> 01:42:58,650
I'm going to tell the generals...

789
01:42:59,096 --> 01:43:00,848
...in Cairo.

790
01:43:01,056 --> 01:43:03,286
Yes, cross Sinai.

791
01:43:03,536 --> 01:43:04,525
Come on!

792
01:43:04,856 --> 01:43:06,130
Sinai?

793
01:43:06,616 --> 01:43:07,844
Yes.

794
01:43:08,336 --> 01:43:11,851
-With these?
-They'll be all right with me.

795
01:43:16,936 --> 01:43:20,895
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

796
01:43:21,136 --> 01:43:23,889
"We've taken Aqaba, "
the generals would laugh.

797
01:43:24,616 --> 01:43:25,844
I see.

798
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:29,453
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

799
01:43:29,656 --> 01:43:33,695
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
ofour quaintness and barbarity...

800
01:43:34,296 --> 01:43:36,446
...and then they will believe you.

801
01:43:37,016 --> 01:43:39,052
You're an ignorant man.

802
01:43:58,256 --> 01:43:59,655
Paper.

803
01:44:00,536 --> 01:44:02,254
Paper!

804
01:44:04,896 --> 01:44:07,456
There is no gold in Aqaba.

805
01:44:08,496 --> 01:44:10,248
No gold.

806
01:44:11,616 --> 01:44:13,447
No great box!

807
01:44:17,496 --> 01:44:19,691
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

808
01:44:20,256 --> 01:44:22,451
For my pleasure, as you said.

809
01:44:23,656 --> 01:44:26,045
But gold is honorable...

810
01:44:27,096 --> 01:44:29,656
...and Lawrence promised gold.

811
01:44:30,696 --> 01:44:31,811
Lawrence lied.

812
01:44:33,696 --> 01:44:35,049
See, Auda.

813
01:44:37,616 --> 01:44:39,652
"The Crown of England...

814
01:44:40,736 --> 01:44:43,045
...promises to pay...

815
01:44:44,016 --> 01:44:48,248
...5000 golden guineas...

816
01:44:48,736 --> 01:44:53,252
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

817
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:58,454
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

818
01:44:58,696 --> 01:45:00,049
...by...

819
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,845
...me.

820
01:45:03,896 --> 01:45:05,932
In 10 days...

821
01:45:06,656 --> 01:45:08,647
...I'll be back with the gold.

822
01:45:09,736 --> 01:45:14,287
With gold, with guns, with everything.

823
01:45:15,336 --> 01:45:16,849
Ten days.

824
01:45:18,056 --> 01:45:19,648
You'll cross Sinai?

825
01:45:19,936 --> 01:45:21,255
Why not?

826
01:45:21,936 --> 01:45:23,608
Moses did.

827
01:45:26,136 --> 01:45:28,252
And you will take the children?

828
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:30,809
Moses did.

829
01:45:31,016 --> 01:45:32,654
Moses was a prophet...

830
01:45:33,136 --> 01:45:35,650
...and beloved of God.

831
01:45:40,736 --> 01:45:44,649
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

832
01:45:45,896 --> 01:45:48,649
He is not perfect.

833
01:45:58,336 --> 01:46:00,645
Lord, can we not rest?

834
01:46:00,856 --> 01:46:03,848
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

835
01:46:06,016 --> 01:46:07,654
Have you two slept in beds?

836
01:46:07,856 --> 01:46:09,050
Farraj?

837
01:46:09,616 --> 01:46:10,844
Daud?

838
01:46:12,016 --> 01:46:13,654
With sheets?

839
01:46:15,496 --> 01:46:18,806
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

840
01:46:19,016 --> 01:46:20,290
I promise.

841
01:46:20,536 --> 01:46:23,050
Then it shall be so, lord.

842
01:46:43,536 --> 01:46:44,855
Look!

843
01:46:51,336 --> 01:46:52,849
Pillar of fire.

844
01:46:55,936 --> 01:46:57,847
No, lord. Dust.

845
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:46,849
My compass.

846
01:47:48,616 --> 01:47:49,844
No matter.

847
01:47:50,256 --> 01:47:53,851
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

848
01:47:54,936 --> 01:47:56,255
Due west.

849
01:48:16,056 --> 01:48:17,455
Come on!

850
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:52,050
Lawrence!

851
01:49:04,256 --> 01:49:05,484
Farraj!

852
01:49:15,336 --> 01:49:18,089
Farraj, don't! Don't!

853
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:20,455
Don't!

854
01:50:52,016 --> 01:50:53,165
Why do you walk?

855
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:57,647
But why, lord?

856
01:51:08,496 --> 01:51:09,724
But why, lord?

857
01:51:09,936 --> 01:51:13,246
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

858
01:51:37,936 --> 01:51:40,325
Lawrence, look!

859
01:52:46,456 --> 01:52:48,412
It's all right, Farraj.

860
01:52:48,616 --> 01:52:50,095
It's all right.

861
01:53:59,056 --> 01:54:00,887
Who are you?

862
01:54:02,896 --> 01:54:05,490
Who are you?

863
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:41,924
-Daud!
-We're here, sir.

864
01:54:59,376 --> 01:55:00,889
You taking him in there?

865
01:55:01,976 --> 01:55:03,295
Yes.

866
01:55:22,976 --> 01:55:24,295
Here!

867
01:55:26,176 --> 01:55:28,406
Here. You!

868
01:55:29,896 --> 01:55:33,252
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

869
01:55:33,976 --> 01:55:35,409
We are thirsty.

870
01:55:37,136 --> 01:55:39,491
-Mr. Lawrence, is it?
-Yes.

871
01:55:39,936 --> 01:55:42,894
-Are you going to the officers' bar?
-Yes.

872
01:55:44,096 --> 01:55:46,291
You can't take him in there, sir.

873
01:55:49,776 --> 01:55:52,244
What do you think you look like?

874
01:56:10,176 --> 01:56:11,734
No, no. You must go.

875
01:56:11,936 --> 01:56:13,449
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

876
01:56:15,216 --> 01:56:17,889
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

877
01:56:19,456 --> 01:56:23,529
We want two large glasses of lemonade.

878
01:56:23,776 --> 01:56:27,451
-This is a bar for British officers.
-We are not particular.

879
01:56:32,576 --> 01:56:36,285
-Are you off your head?
-No. Oddly enough I'm not.

880
01:56:36,576 --> 01:56:40,046
-Just clear out of here, will you?
-Get that boy out of here.

881
01:56:40,336 --> 01:56:42,930
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

882
01:56:43,576 --> 01:56:46,010
-Get that wog out of here.
-Clear off.

883
01:56:48,056 --> 01:56:49,694
What's going on?

884
01:56:52,536 --> 01:56:56,290
-It's Lawrence, sir.
-Lemonade with ice.

885
01:56:57,576 --> 01:56:59,089
Explain yourself.

886
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,448
We've taken Aqaba.

887
01:57:01,976 --> 01:57:04,536
-Taken Aqaba? Who has?
-We have.

888
01:57:04,776 --> 01:57:09,088
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

889
01:57:09,776 --> 01:57:11,095
We have.

890
01:57:12,776 --> 01:57:14,573
He likes your lemonade.

891
01:57:14,896 --> 01:57:16,773
You mean the Turks have gone?

892
01:57:17,056 --> 01:57:19,854
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

893
01:57:20,376 --> 01:57:24,289
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

894
01:57:24,776 --> 01:57:26,892
That's not true. We killed some.

895
01:57:27,136 --> 01:57:30,890
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

896
01:57:32,176 --> 01:57:34,974
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

897
01:57:36,976 --> 01:57:40,332
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

898
01:57:40,576 --> 01:57:43,215
-It isn't possible.
-Yes, it is.

899
01:57:43,576 --> 01:57:45,294
I did it.

900
01:57:50,336 --> 01:57:51,928
You'd better talk to Allenby.

901
01:57:52,176 --> 01:57:54,849
-General Allenby?
-He's in command. Murray's gone.

902
01:57:55,056 --> 01:57:57,251
That's a step in the right direction.

903
01:57:57,976 --> 01:58:00,615
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

904
01:58:00,896 --> 01:58:03,490
-Yes, of course.
-It's for him.

905
01:58:05,136 --> 01:58:07,934
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

906
01:58:08,176 --> 01:58:10,087
See Allenby first, though.

907
01:58:10,736 --> 01:58:12,294
Will he see me?

908
01:58:13,056 --> 01:58:14,489
I think so.

909
01:58:15,176 --> 01:58:16,689
Do that, then.

910
01:58:21,376 --> 01:58:23,890
-I'd better shave.
-Yes, you had.

911
01:58:24,096 --> 01:58:26,610
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

912
01:58:37,296 --> 01:58:39,093
" Undisciplined.

913
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,773
Unpunctual.

914
01:58:43,856 --> 01:58:45,733
Untidy.

915
01:58:47,496 --> 01:58:49,532
Several languages.

916
01:58:50,776 --> 01:58:52,687
Knowledge of music...

917
01:58:53,536 --> 01:58:55,208
...literature.

918
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:58,133
Knowledge of....

919
01:58:59,456 --> 01:59:01,128
Knowledge of...."

920
01:59:04,256 --> 01:59:07,089
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

921
01:59:07,696 --> 01:59:10,688
-Who told you to take Aqaba?
-Nobody.

922
01:59:10,976 --> 01:59:13,536
-Sir.
-Sir.

923
01:59:13,776 --> 01:59:15,050
Then why did you?

924
01:59:15,256 --> 01:59:17,645
-Aqaba's important.
-Why is it important?

925
01:59:17,856 --> 01:59:20,290
-It's the Turkish route to the canal.
-Not anymore.

926
01:59:20,496 --> 01:59:24,489
-They're coming through Beersheba.
-I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

927
01:59:24,696 --> 01:59:29,087
-So?
-So that left Aqaba behind your right.

928
01:59:29,656 --> 01:59:30,645
True.

929
01:59:30,856 --> 01:59:35,293
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

930
01:59:36,136 --> 01:59:38,411
Am I going for Jerusalem?

931
01:59:38,736 --> 01:59:39,885
Yes.

932
01:59:42,136 --> 01:59:43,489
Very well.

933
01:59:43,736 --> 01:59:45,886
Aqaba behind my right.

934
01:59:46,136 --> 01:59:48,889
It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.

935
01:59:50,296 --> 01:59:51,490
Anything else?

936
01:59:51,696 --> 01:59:52,890
Yes.

937
01:59:53,176 --> 01:59:55,485
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

938
01:59:56,016 --> 01:59:58,928
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

939
01:59:59,176 --> 02:00:02,566
No. I think you should
leave them there.

940
02:00:02,776 --> 02:00:04,687
You acted without orders, you know.

941
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:09,415
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

942
02:00:09,616 --> 02:00:11,891
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

943
02:00:12,096 --> 02:00:14,326
Yes, I know.

944
02:00:14,576 --> 02:00:16,089
Already?

945
02:00:16,336 --> 02:00:17,485
Yes.

946
02:00:19,176 --> 02:00:21,690
I'm promoting you major.

947
02:00:22,656 --> 02:00:24,806
I don't think that's a very good idea.

948
02:00:25,016 --> 02:00:27,974
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

949
02:00:28,176 --> 02:00:31,691
...and carry on the good work.

950
02:00:32,176 --> 02:00:34,895
No. Thank you, sir.

951
02:00:35,376 --> 02:00:39,164
-Why not?
-Well, l, it's....

952
02:00:39,376 --> 02:00:40,695
Let me see now....

953
02:00:42,336 --> 02:00:45,885
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

954
02:00:46,096 --> 02:00:48,246
One was a boy.

955
02:00:48,456 --> 02:00:49,855
That was...

956
02:00:51,376 --> 02:00:53,173
...yesterday.

957
02:00:53,376 --> 02:00:55,332
I led him into a quicksand.

958
02:00:55,576 --> 02:00:57,168
The other was a man.

959
02:00:57,496 --> 02:00:59,327
That was...

960
02:00:59,536 --> 02:01:01,891
...before Aqaba, anyway.

961
02:01:02,536 --> 02:01:05,096
I had to execute him with my pistol.

962
02:01:05,576 --> 02:01:08,534
There was something about it
I didn't like.

963
02:01:08,776 --> 02:01:11,768
-Well, naturally.
-No. Something else.

964
02:01:13,936 --> 02:01:16,211
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

965
02:01:16,416 --> 02:01:18,407
No. Something else.

966
02:01:19,976 --> 02:01:21,534
What, then?

967
02:01:22,376 --> 02:01:24,651
I enjoyed it.

968
02:01:31,856 --> 02:01:35,246
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

969
02:01:36,936 --> 02:01:40,406
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

970
02:01:40,616 --> 02:01:42,254
Yes. Entirely.

971
02:01:42,496 --> 02:01:45,488
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

972
02:01:45,776 --> 02:01:47,732
Fascinating gear they wear.

973
02:01:47,976 --> 02:01:50,126
How would I look in this, Harry?

974
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:53,692
-Damn ridiculous, sir.
-Here, you keep it.

975
02:01:54,536 --> 02:01:58,495
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

976
02:01:58,696 --> 02:02:01,449
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

977
02:02:02,456 --> 02:02:06,847
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

978
02:02:07,176 --> 02:02:10,054
-Brighton?
-I know what he thinks.

979
02:02:11,176 --> 02:02:14,373
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

980
02:02:14,696 --> 02:02:17,494
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

981
02:02:17,696 --> 02:02:20,688
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

982
02:02:22,176 --> 02:02:23,973
-Mr. Perkins!
-Sir!

983
02:02:24,176 --> 02:02:26,690
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

984
02:02:30,576 --> 02:02:33,852
-You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
-Yes, sir.

985
02:02:34,056 --> 02:02:38,174
-What do you think about it?
-Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

986
02:02:38,376 --> 02:02:41,288
-Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
-Sir!

987
02:02:46,776 --> 02:02:48,289
Come on, then.

988
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:53,494
You're a clever man, sir.

989
02:02:53,776 --> 02:02:57,246
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

990
02:02:57,496 --> 02:03:00,090
That's fair, surely?

991
02:03:19,776 --> 02:03:24,645
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

992
02:03:24,896 --> 02:03:27,091
-Bravo.
-You know better?

993
02:03:45,856 --> 02:03:48,575
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

994
02:03:48,776 --> 02:03:51,085
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

995
02:04:26,176 --> 02:04:28,485
Easy, gentlemen, please.

996
02:04:29,656 --> 02:04:31,772
-Give us a drink.
-Of course, sir.

997
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:35,692
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

998
02:04:36,456 --> 02:04:37,571
Tracy.

999
02:04:39,376 --> 02:04:41,173
Shall we go outside?

1000
02:04:51,856 --> 02:04:55,007
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

1001
02:04:55,256 --> 02:04:56,245
Yes.

1002
02:04:56,456 --> 02:04:58,686
With 1000 Arabs?

1003
02:04:59,736 --> 02:05:02,728
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1004
02:05:02,936 --> 02:05:04,847
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1005
02:05:05,376 --> 02:05:06,968
It means 1000 camels.

1006
02:05:07,256 --> 02:05:11,329
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1007
02:05:11,856 --> 02:05:15,485
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1008
02:05:16,056 --> 02:05:17,887
I'll smash his railways.

1009
02:05:18,096 --> 02:05:20,530
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1010
02:05:20,776 --> 02:05:23,449
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1011
02:05:23,696 --> 02:05:25,971
You are going back, then?

1012
02:05:28,696 --> 02:05:29,890
Yes.

1013
02:05:30,256 --> 02:05:32,486
Of course I'm going back.

1014
02:05:36,656 --> 02:05:39,011
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1015
02:05:39,256 --> 02:05:43,329
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handf ul of bandits...

1016
02:05:43,536 --> 02:05:44,651
...he'll withdraw.

1017
02:05:44,856 --> 02:05:47,495
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1018
02:05:47,696 --> 02:05:50,130
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1019
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:52,765
-I wonder who will.
-No one will.

1020
02:05:53,376 --> 02:05:55,492
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1021
02:06:01,256 --> 02:06:03,486
That's what I've told them anyway.

1022
02:06:03,936 --> 02:06:05,688
That's what they think.

1023
02:06:06,136 --> 02:06:09,253
-That's why they're fighting.
-Oh, surely.

1024
02:06:12,096 --> 02:06:14,291
They've only one suspicion.

1025
02:06:14,696 --> 02:06:18,894
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1026
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:23,448
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1027
02:06:23,656 --> 02:06:24,645
Have we?

1028
02:06:25,176 --> 02:06:27,246
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1029
02:06:27,456 --> 02:06:30,448
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1030
02:06:31,376 --> 02:06:33,571
Difficult question, sir.

1031
02:06:35,496 --> 02:06:39,125
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1032
02:06:39,336 --> 02:06:42,567
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1033
02:06:43,616 --> 02:06:45,049
Certainly.

1034
02:07:01,856 --> 02:07:05,166
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1035
02:07:05,376 --> 02:07:06,491
Right.

1036
02:07:06,736 --> 02:07:09,967
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1037
02:07:10,936 --> 02:07:14,167
-Instructors for the Lewis guns.
-Right.

1038
02:07:14,376 --> 02:07:15,889
More money.

1039
02:07:16,176 --> 02:07:19,248
-How much more?
-25, 000 now. A lot more later.

1040
02:07:19,456 --> 02:07:22,050
-Dryden?
-It can be done, sir.

1041
02:07:22,256 --> 02:07:24,975
A couple of armoured cars.

1042
02:07:25,176 --> 02:07:26,495
Right.

1043
02:07:27,176 --> 02:07:28,689
Field artillery.

1044
02:07:30,776 --> 02:07:32,095
Right.

1045
02:07:34,896 --> 02:07:37,091
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

1046
02:07:37,296 --> 02:07:40,094
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1047
02:07:40,296 --> 02:07:42,890
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1048
02:08:17,096 --> 02:08:18,893
Congratulations!

1049
02:08:28,776 --> 02:08:31,734
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1050
02:08:31,936 --> 02:08:33,688
I was wondering that, sir.

1051
02:08:33,896 --> 02:08:36,012
Might be difficult to get it back.

1052
02:08:36,256 --> 02:08:39,646
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1053
02:08:39,856 --> 02:08:41,733
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1054
02:08:41,976 --> 02:08:43,807
-For you to say.
-No, it's not.

1055
02:08:44,056 --> 02:08:46,695
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1056
02:08:46,896 --> 02:08:48,773
Not like that poor devil.

1057
02:08:49,256 --> 02:08:50,769
He's riding the whirlwind.

1058
02:08:50,976 --> 02:08:53,092
Let's hope we're not.

1059
02:14:07,696 --> 02:14:10,768
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1060
02:14:11,296 --> 02:14:12,490
To Prince Feisal.

1061
02:14:12,696 --> 02:14:15,369
-You're not Prince Feisal?
-No.

1062
02:14:15,616 --> 02:14:16,890
You know him though?

1063
02:14:17,096 --> 02:14:20,406
He is my master. I am his servant.

1064
02:14:23,496 --> 02:14:24,724
Can you read?

1065
02:14:33,056 --> 02:14:37,368
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1066
02:14:37,616 --> 02:14:41,006
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1067
02:14:54,616 --> 02:14:55,731
Now....

1068
02:14:56,896 --> 02:15:00,684
-Where can I find Major Lawrence?
-Is that what you have come for?

1069
02:15:00,896 --> 02:15:02,932
Not altogether, sir, no.

1070
02:15:03,216 --> 02:15:07,368
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1071
02:15:07,576 --> 02:15:10,568
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1072
02:15:10,816 --> 02:15:11,931
I don't know.

1073
02:15:12,576 --> 02:15:15,136
-Last week they were near El Ghira.
-Ghira?

1074
02:15:15,376 --> 02:15:19,051
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1075
02:15:19,976 --> 02:15:22,444
-I've never tried.
-Take a mule.

1076
02:15:23,016 --> 02:15:25,007
A void Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1077
02:15:25,416 --> 02:15:27,884
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1078
02:15:28,096 --> 02:15:29,324
They do.

1079
02:15:29,576 --> 02:15:32,613
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1080
02:15:32,936 --> 02:15:34,335
Myself...

1081
02:15:34,936 --> 02:15:36,767
...I am going to Cairo.

1082
02:15:36,976 --> 02:15:38,887
-As you know.
-Yes.

1083
02:15:39,096 --> 02:15:41,485
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1084
02:15:42,016 --> 02:15:43,210
Yes.

1085
02:15:46,616 --> 02:15:48,891
I know you've been
given no artillery.

1086
02:15:49,336 --> 02:15:51,770
-That is so.
-You're handicapped?

1087
02:15:51,976 --> 02:15:53,932
It restricts us to small things.

1088
02:15:54,136 --> 02:15:55,364
It's intended to.

1089
02:15:57,976 --> 02:15:59,534
Do you know General Allenby?

1090
02:16:00,496 --> 02:16:03,806
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1091
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:06,690
-Excuse me?
-A clever man.

1092
02:16:06,936 --> 02:16:09,734
Slim customer. It's very good.

1093
02:16:09,976 --> 02:16:14,367
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1094
02:16:14,616 --> 02:16:17,972
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1095
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:20,485
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1096
02:16:20,696 --> 02:16:22,812
...who struggle for their freedom.

1097
02:16:23,016 --> 02:16:25,132
Very gratifying.

1098
02:16:27,776 --> 02:16:31,928
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1099
02:16:32,136 --> 02:16:34,331
I badly want a story to tell.

1100
02:16:34,576 --> 02:16:38,171
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1101
02:16:38,816 --> 02:16:41,569
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1102
02:16:41,776 --> 02:16:43,653
And before I leave here...

1103
02:16:43,896 --> 02:16:46,126
...which must be presently...

1104
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:49,726
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1105
02:16:51,416 --> 02:16:54,567
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1106
02:16:54,776 --> 02:16:55,845
I do, sir.

1107
02:16:56,056 --> 02:16:58,889
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1108
02:16:59,096 --> 02:17:01,485
My army is made up of tribes.

1109
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:04,574
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1110
02:17:04,776 --> 02:17:07,813
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1111
02:17:08,016 --> 02:17:10,928
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1112
02:17:11,536 --> 02:17:14,733
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1113
02:17:15,536 --> 02:17:18,812
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1114
02:17:19,016 --> 02:17:21,530
...beyond every other man.

1115
02:17:22,216 --> 02:17:25,208
One figure I can give you
f rom my head...

1116
02:17:25,416 --> 02:17:28,931
...because it never leaves my head.

1117
02:17:29,416 --> 02:17:33,295
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1118
02:17:34,216 --> 02:17:36,525
...37 wounded...

1119
02:17:38,976 --> 02:17:42,173
...156 dead.

1120
02:17:43,696 --> 02:17:48,292
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1121
02:17:48,496 --> 02:17:49,724
Yeah.

1122
02:17:50,016 --> 02:17:51,369
Four times as many.

1123
02:17:51,576 --> 02:17:56,127
That's because those too badly wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1124
02:17:56,336 --> 02:17:58,725
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1125
02:17:59,176 --> 02:18:02,691
-You mean...?
-We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1126
02:18:03,176 --> 02:18:06,407
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1127
02:18:06,616 --> 02:18:10,928
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1128
02:18:11,136 --> 02:18:12,967
...and are treated harshly.

1129
02:18:13,616 --> 02:18:14,685
How harshly?

1130
02:18:14,936 --> 02:18:17,734
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1131
02:18:18,456 --> 02:18:19,445
I see.

1132
02:18:19,656 --> 02:18:22,728
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1133
02:18:22,936 --> 02:18:26,611
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1134
02:18:26,816 --> 02:18:30,729
-I should like you to notice that.
-Yes, sir.

1135
02:18:31,696 --> 02:18:34,210
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1136
02:18:34,616 --> 02:18:35,969
Why should you suppose?

1137
02:18:36,176 --> 02:18:38,531
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1138
02:18:38,736 --> 02:18:41,091
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1139
02:18:41,296 --> 02:18:42,888
That is exactly so.

1140
02:18:43,096 --> 02:18:46,452
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1141
02:18:46,776 --> 02:18:49,529
With me, it is merely good manners.

1142
02:18:49,736 --> 02:18:53,695
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1143
02:18:54,296 --> 02:18:57,572
-And now, perhaps....
-Oh, sure, sure.

1144
02:19:01,496 --> 02:19:03,088
Thank you, sir.

1145
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:04,968
Can you manage the letter--?

1146
02:19:05,216 --> 02:19:07,969
I'll do everything I have said...

1147
02:19:08,176 --> 02:19:11,566
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1148
02:19:11,816 --> 02:19:14,091
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1149
02:19:15,936 --> 02:19:18,928
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1150
02:19:19,136 --> 02:19:21,570
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1151
02:19:21,856 --> 02:19:22,845
Oh, no.

1152
02:19:23,096 --> 02:19:26,725
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1153
02:19:26,936 --> 02:19:29,575
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1154
02:19:29,776 --> 02:19:31,687
And Turkey.

1155
02:19:31,976 --> 02:19:36,094
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is....

1156
02:19:36,616 --> 02:19:38,925
-Enjoyable?
-Hardly that, sir.

1157
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:42,048
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1158
02:19:42,256 --> 02:19:45,692
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1159
02:19:47,216 --> 02:19:48,968
All right. Yes.

1160
02:19:49,576 --> 02:19:51,134
Lawrence is your man.

1161
02:20:29,376 --> 02:20:30,365
Stop!

1162
02:20:48,976 --> 02:20:50,534
Stop it!

1163
02:20:51,296 --> 02:20:52,649
Stop it!

1164
02:21:00,496 --> 02:21:01,929
Come on, men!

1165
02:22:08,296 --> 02:22:09,524
Lawrence!

1166
02:22:29,416 --> 02:22:31,327
Good God! God!

1167
02:23:15,776 --> 02:23:20,372
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1168
02:23:20,656 --> 02:23:22,772
Why don't you take a picture?

1169
02:23:23,176 --> 02:23:24,370
Wish I had.

1170
02:23:28,456 --> 02:23:30,572
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1171
02:23:32,696 --> 02:23:33,685
Am I in this?

1172
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:36,328
Did you take his picture?

1173
02:23:36,536 --> 02:23:37,764
Yeah.

1174
02:23:41,976 --> 02:23:45,969
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1175
02:23:48,376 --> 02:23:50,332
Charming company you keep.

1176
02:23:50,576 --> 02:23:51,770
Auda?

1177
02:23:52,536 --> 02:23:57,371
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1178
02:23:57,736 --> 02:23:59,692
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1179
02:23:59,936 --> 02:24:01,972
It's all right to take your picture?

1180
02:24:02,536 --> 02:24:03,969
-All right.
-Okay.

1181
02:24:04,176 --> 02:24:05,575
Just walk.

1182
02:25:03,336 --> 02:25:05,372
Major Lawrence!

1183
02:25:05,976 --> 02:25:08,570
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1184
02:25:16,256 --> 02:25:18,770
This looting has got to stop!

1185
02:25:19,016 --> 02:25:20,290
It is customary.

1186
02:25:20,536 --> 02:25:23,972
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1187
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:26,366
I would not say that to Auda.

1188
02:25:26,856 --> 02:25:29,495
-It is their payment, colonel.
-Payment.

1189
02:25:29,736 --> 02:25:32,375
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1190
02:25:33,256 --> 02:25:36,407
-They don't go home when being paid.
-They are not free to.

1191
02:25:41,016 --> 02:25:44,975
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1192
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:46,774
They'll come back.

1193
02:25:47,576 --> 02:25:50,409
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1194
02:25:50,656 --> 02:25:52,772
Not this year, Lawrence.

1195
02:25:53,456 --> 02:25:57,688
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you
think you'll have left? 200?

1196
02:25:57,936 --> 02:26:00,575
-Less.
-Well, then?

1197
02:26:00,936 --> 02:26:03,166
I said, they'll come back.

1198
02:26:03,856 --> 02:26:04,971
You badly hurt?

1199
02:26:06,456 --> 02:26:08,174
Not hurt at all.

1200
02:26:08,376 --> 02:26:12,369
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1201
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:31,165
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1202
02:26:31,576 --> 02:26:34,966
-What are you learning from this?
-Politics.

1203
02:26:35,656 --> 02:26:39,934
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1204
02:26:40,576 --> 02:26:42,771
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1205
02:26:44,976 --> 02:26:46,204
Did I answer well?

1206
02:26:46,576 --> 02:26:50,569
You answered without saying anything.
That's politics.

1207
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:53,414
You learn quickly.

1208
02:26:54,656 --> 02:26:56,772
I have a good teacher.

1209
02:26:59,256 --> 02:27:00,575
Yeah.

1210
02:27:08,016 --> 02:27:09,768
-How's your hurt?
-Fine.

1211
02:27:09,976 --> 02:27:14,606
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1212
02:27:14,856 --> 02:27:17,768
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1213
02:27:18,016 --> 02:27:21,213
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1214
02:27:21,456 --> 02:27:22,571
One.

1215
02:27:23,016 --> 02:27:26,770
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1216
02:27:27,056 --> 02:27:29,365
They hope to gain their freedom.

1217
02:27:30,656 --> 02:27:31,645
Freedom.

1218
02:27:32,856 --> 02:27:35,575
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1219
02:27:35,816 --> 02:27:39,331
-There's one born every minute.
-They're going to get it.

1220
02:27:40,056 --> 02:27:42,172
I'm going to give it to them.

1221
02:27:43,776 --> 02:27:44,925
The second question?

1222
02:27:46,456 --> 02:27:49,368
Well, I was going to ask...

1223
02:27:49,856 --> 02:27:53,644
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1224
02:27:55,576 --> 02:27:56,691
It's clean.

1225
02:28:00,256 --> 02:28:01,769
Well, now...

1226
02:28:02,576 --> 02:28:04,646
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1227
02:28:04,976 --> 02:28:06,568
May I...

1228
02:28:07,176 --> 02:28:09,565
...take one farewell picture?

1229
02:28:10,336 --> 02:28:13,294
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1230
02:28:13,536 --> 02:28:16,369
One clock for two lamps.

1231
02:28:16,856 --> 02:28:18,005
A fair bargain.

1232
02:28:18,256 --> 02:28:20,770
Fair? I robbed him.

1233
02:28:31,736 --> 02:28:33,169
Trash.

1234
02:28:34,256 --> 02:28:36,611
I must find something honorable.

1235
02:28:36,856 --> 02:28:38,369
Honorable?

1236
02:28:38,936 --> 02:28:42,565
The year is running out, Brighton.

1237
02:28:46,776 --> 02:28:49,654
I must find something honorable.

1238
02:31:14,976 --> 02:31:17,092
Now you may blow up my train.

1239
02:31:17,336 --> 02:31:18,974
And what will you do now?

1240
02:31:19,216 --> 02:31:23,573
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1241
02:31:24,336 --> 02:31:26,247
They will carry my toys too, see?

1242
02:31:26,616 --> 02:31:29,574
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1243
02:31:29,816 --> 02:31:33,047
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1244
02:31:33,256 --> 02:31:37,693
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1245
02:31:37,936 --> 02:31:40,370
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1246
02:31:40,616 --> 02:31:42,174
No, I shan't, Auda.

1247
02:31:42,936 --> 02:31:44,289
Then you are a fool.

1248
02:31:44,936 --> 02:31:47,814
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1249
02:31:48,856 --> 02:31:50,972
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1250
02:31:51,216 --> 02:31:54,174
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.

1251
02:31:55,376 --> 02:31:57,367
You are an impudent rascal.

1252
02:31:58,856 --> 02:32:02,974
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1253
02:32:12,976 --> 02:32:14,614
Like talking to a brick wall.

1254
02:32:22,936 --> 02:32:25,496
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1255
02:32:26,136 --> 02:32:27,774
I'll go north.

1256
02:32:29,056 --> 02:32:30,808
That's what Allenby wants.

1257
02:32:31,056 --> 02:32:34,969
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1258
02:32:35,216 --> 02:32:37,366
Then that's where I'll take it.

1259
02:32:38,336 --> 02:32:43,012
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1260
02:32:43,256 --> 02:32:44,371
Won't we?

1261
02:33:15,536 --> 02:33:16,525
Train, Farraj.

1262
02:33:17,536 --> 02:33:18,969
Yeah, Lawrence.

1263
02:33:47,016 --> 02:33:48,768
Hide yourself, my friend.

1264
02:33:57,616 --> 02:33:58,969
Detonator.

1265
02:34:11,936 --> 02:34:13,574
All right, fetch another.

1266
02:34:13,776 --> 02:34:17,371
-Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
-Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1267
02:34:22,616 --> 02:34:23,969
Farraj?

1268
02:34:33,816 --> 02:34:36,774
-What happened?
-Detonator. A detonator!

1269
02:34:49,736 --> 02:34:50,930
He cannot ride.

1270
02:35:01,216 --> 02:35:03,969
If they take him alive, you know what
they'll do to him.

1271
02:35:15,856 --> 02:35:18,165
Daud will be angry with you.

1272
02:35:19,176 --> 02:35:20,973
Salute him for me.

1273
02:35:39,936 --> 02:35:41,574
What will you do now?

1274
02:35:42,936 --> 02:35:44,369
Go north.

1275
02:35:44,616 --> 02:35:45,969
With twenty?

1276
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:49,171
What would you recommend me to do?

1277
02:35:50,856 --> 02:35:52,767
What would you recommend?

1278
02:35:57,536 --> 02:35:59,766
He hasn't 1l10 so many men, sir.

1279
02:35:59,976 --> 02:36:01,773
He's lied, in fact.

1280
02:36:03,056 --> 02:36:06,605
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1281
02:36:06,856 --> 02:36:09,370
Then there is an Arab north army.

1282
02:36:10,856 --> 02:36:15,168
-No, sir, he has lied about that.
-Any idea why?

1283
02:36:15,536 --> 02:36:19,370
-It's his army, I suppose.
-It's Prince Feisal's army.

1284
02:36:20,736 --> 02:36:23,170
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1285
02:36:24,456 --> 02:36:25,969
No.

1286
02:36:26,976 --> 02:36:30,571
He would if he could, I think.

1287
02:36:32,256 --> 02:36:35,566
-Not my line of country.
-It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1288
02:36:36,256 --> 02:36:38,406
What matters is I believed it.

1289
02:36:38,656 --> 02:36:40,294
The Turks believe it.

1290
02:36:40,536 --> 02:36:43,767
They are offering 20, 000 pounds
for him.

1291
02:36:45,656 --> 02:36:47,374
Good heavens.

1292
02:36:47,816 --> 02:36:51,365
-Shouldn't say he had long to live.
-Well, he's a brave man--

1293
02:36:51,576 --> 02:36:55,774
Surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1294
02:36:56,936 --> 02:36:59,575
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1295
02:37:01,216 --> 02:37:05,175
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1296
02:37:05,416 --> 02:37:07,293
I wouldn't be surprised.

1297
02:37:07,536 --> 02:37:11,006
-They think he's a kind of prophet.
-They do or he does?

1298
02:37:25,976 --> 02:37:28,444
-Now may I speak?
-Yes.

1299
02:37:29,056 --> 02:37:32,093
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1300
02:37:33,456 --> 02:37:36,812
-I do not include myself.
-I do not include the others.

1301
02:37:37,056 --> 02:37:39,172
So say they love you.

1302
02:37:39,576 --> 02:37:41,965
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1303
02:37:42,176 --> 02:37:45,168
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1304
02:37:45,376 --> 02:37:47,446
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1305
02:37:47,696 --> 02:37:50,768
That's right. That's right.

1306
02:37:51,376 --> 02:37:53,765
Who are you to know what can be done?

1307
02:37:54,216 --> 02:37:57,686
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1308
02:37:58,256 --> 02:38:02,534
Whatever I ask them to do can be done.
They know that if you don't.

1309
02:38:04,536 --> 02:38:07,369
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1310
02:38:07,856 --> 02:38:09,175
Do you?

1311
02:38:12,256 --> 02:38:15,453
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1312
02:38:18,776 --> 02:38:22,974
-Who will come with me into Deraa?
-Deraa is garrisoned.

1313
02:38:23,176 --> 02:38:25,167
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1314
02:38:25,416 --> 02:38:28,965
-I'll go by myself if I have to.
-Why?

1315
02:38:29,216 --> 02:38:31,013
I told the English generals...

1316
02:38:31,256 --> 02:38:34,726
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1317
02:38:35,176 --> 02:38:37,167
Or perhaps you are here...

1318
02:38:37,776 --> 02:38:39,653
...for the English generals.

1319
02:38:41,616 --> 02:38:43,208
Who says this?

1320
02:38:43,456 --> 02:38:44,775
Rumour.

1321
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:48,405
That is not an argument.

1322
02:38:48,656 --> 02:38:50,772
Oh, argument.

1323
02:38:50,976 --> 02:38:54,207
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1324
02:38:54,456 --> 02:38:56,765
...while the Arabs argue.

1325
02:38:58,616 --> 02:39:01,608
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1326
02:39:01,976 --> 02:39:05,605
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1327
02:39:14,456 --> 02:39:15,650
It's madness.

1328
02:39:18,976 --> 02:39:20,694
What are you looking for?

1329
02:39:20,936 --> 02:39:23,291
Some way to announce myself.

1330
02:39:23,536 --> 02:39:25,367
Be patient with him, God.

1331
02:39:38,256 --> 02:39:42,329
-Do you not see how they look at you?
-Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1332
02:39:42,536 --> 02:39:43,764
Halt!

1333
02:39:44,016 --> 02:39:45,165
Walk on.

1334
02:39:45,376 --> 02:39:47,173
-Halt!
-Walk on.

1335
02:39:48,256 --> 02:39:50,372
You and you.

1336
02:41:27,376 --> 02:41:28,365
You.

1337
02:41:44,256 --> 02:41:46,167
You have blue eyes.

1338
02:41:47,056 --> 02:41:51,095
-I say you have blue eyes.
-Yes, effendi.

1339
02:41:51,336 --> 02:41:54,453
-Are you Circassian?
-Yes, effendi.

1340
02:41:55,336 --> 02:41:56,815
How old are you?

1341
02:41:57,056 --> 02:41:59,968
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1342
02:42:00,176 --> 02:42:01,973
I think.

1343
02:42:02,216 --> 02:42:06,573
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1344
02:42:07,776 --> 02:42:09,767
It's an interesting face.

1345
02:42:14,256 --> 02:42:16,565
I am surrounded by cattle.

1346
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:20,765
He wouldn't know an interesting face
f rom a sow's belly.

1347
02:42:21,736 --> 02:42:25,570
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1348
02:42:25,776 --> 02:42:29,974
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1349
02:42:30,176 --> 02:42:31,973
...isolated.

1350
02:42:33,776 --> 02:42:36,290
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

1351
02:42:36,536 --> 02:42:38,174
No, effendi.

1352
02:42:40,656 --> 02:42:41,975
Have you?

1353
02:42:43,176 --> 02:42:44,370
No.

1354
02:42:45,056 --> 02:42:46,808
That would be too...

1355
02:42:47,056 --> 02:42:48,569
...lucky.

1356
02:43:12,056 --> 02:43:13,774
Where did you get that?

1357
02:43:15,576 --> 02:43:19,569
-It's old, effendi.
-No, this is recent.

1358
02:43:21,576 --> 02:43:23,692
-You are a deserter.
-No, effendi.

1359
02:43:23,936 --> 02:43:25,767
Yes, you are a deserter.

1360
02:43:26,816 --> 02:43:28,966
But from which army?

1361
02:43:31,376 --> 02:43:33,571
Not that it matters at all.

1362
02:43:33,856 --> 02:43:36,131
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1363
02:43:47,136 --> 02:43:49,013
Your skin is very fair.

1364
02:44:07,136 --> 02:44:08,364
Beat him.

1365
02:45:39,056 --> 02:45:40,375
To me!

1366
02:47:37,856 --> 02:47:39,369
Sleep.

1367
02:47:41,056 --> 02:47:42,569
Sleep.

1368
02:47:53,856 --> 02:47:55,175
Eat.

1369
02:48:00,776 --> 02:48:01,970
Eat.

1370
02:48:05,656 --> 02:48:08,375
You have a body, like other men.

1371
02:48:16,576 --> 02:48:17,565
Good.

1372
02:48:18,656 --> 02:48:20,374
Then sleep.

1373
02:48:33,336 --> 02:48:34,564
Better?

1374
02:48:35,136 --> 02:48:37,775
Much better. You were right.

1375
02:48:38,016 --> 02:48:40,086
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1376
02:48:41,016 --> 02:48:42,972
Oh, I've learned all right.

1377
02:48:48,536 --> 02:48:50,174
I'm going, Ali.

1378
02:48:51,216 --> 02:48:53,207
-Why?
-Why?

1379
02:48:54,456 --> 02:48:55,684
Heavens.

1380
02:48:55,936 --> 02:48:57,164
Why?

1381
02:48:58,056 --> 02:49:00,172
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1382
02:49:00,416 --> 02:49:02,372
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1383
02:49:02,616 --> 02:49:05,608
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1384
02:49:05,856 --> 02:49:08,768
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1385
02:49:09,016 --> 02:49:11,894
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1386
02:49:12,136 --> 02:49:13,967
You proved it.

1387
02:49:14,216 --> 02:49:16,286
Look, Ali. Look.

1388
02:49:16,536 --> 02:49:20,165
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1389
02:49:20,936 --> 02:49:23,131
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1390
02:49:23,336 --> 02:49:25,896
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1391
02:49:27,576 --> 02:49:28,975
He can...

1392
02:49:29,176 --> 02:49:31,974
...but he can't want what he wants.

1393
02:49:32,856 --> 02:49:35,973
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1394
02:49:38,656 --> 02:49:42,285
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1395
02:49:42,536 --> 02:49:46,290
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1396
02:49:46,536 --> 02:49:49,175
-I tried to.
-So would any man.

1397
02:49:49,376 --> 02:49:52,766
Well, any man is what I am.

1398
02:49:53,736 --> 02:49:57,570
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1399
02:49:57,816 --> 02:49:59,772
...that any man can do.

1400
02:50:00,056 --> 02:50:01,887
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1401
02:50:02,136 --> 02:50:04,730
-I'll make easy stages.
-You?

1402
02:50:06,256 --> 02:50:09,566
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1403
02:50:11,256 --> 02:50:15,613
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

1404
02:50:15,856 --> 02:50:17,369
...ordinarily...

1405
02:50:18,016 --> 02:50:19,369
...happy.

1406
02:50:23,056 --> 02:50:24,569
Can I take this?

1407
02:50:25,176 --> 02:50:27,007
It is not clean.

1408
02:50:27,256 --> 02:50:30,168
No, but it's warm.

1409
02:50:30,576 --> 02:50:31,770
And these...

1410
02:50:32,016 --> 02:50:35,770
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1411
02:50:37,216 --> 02:50:42,210
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1412
02:50:44,336 --> 02:50:46,452
And let me go back to mine.

1413
02:51:14,416 --> 02:51:17,374
-I say, don't forget those form fives.
-All right.

1414
02:51:23,016 --> 02:51:24,768
Mind if I join you?

1415
02:51:25,576 --> 02:51:27,168
Honoured, sir.

1416
02:51:29,416 --> 02:51:32,567
-Good to be back.
-We heard you were, sir.

1417
02:51:33,136 --> 02:51:35,570
-What's doing out there?
-Where?

1418
02:51:35,816 --> 02:51:37,966
-Arabia?
-Well, yes, sir.

1419
02:51:38,216 --> 02:51:41,413
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1420
02:51:41,656 --> 02:51:43,965
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1421
02:51:44,176 --> 02:51:45,575
Jolly good.

1422
02:51:46,376 --> 02:51:50,164
Well, I have to go up there.

1423
02:51:51,136 --> 02:51:53,491
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1424
02:51:53,736 --> 02:51:55,374
Bloody wogs.

1425
02:51:56,736 --> 02:51:58,567
Yes, probably.

1426
02:51:59,256 --> 02:52:01,531
Jolly good about the squash court.

1427
02:52:04,176 --> 02:52:06,565
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1428
02:52:19,256 --> 02:52:20,371
Morning.

1429
02:52:20,656 --> 02:52:22,374
-Good morning.
-Good to be back.

1430
02:52:22,616 --> 02:52:25,574
-I'll believe you, sir.
-No, really it is.

1431
02:52:28,696 --> 02:52:29,970
Hello.

1432
02:52:30,576 --> 02:52:33,568
Morning. You're to go right in.

1433
02:52:45,096 --> 02:52:46,290
Lawrence.

1434
02:52:48,216 --> 02:52:50,650
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1435
02:52:51,296 --> 02:52:52,285
Sir.

1436
02:52:58,176 --> 02:52:59,973
Well, general, I will leave you.

1437
02:53:00,216 --> 02:53:02,969
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1438
02:53:03,256 --> 02:53:06,885
...about my people
and their weakness...

1439
02:53:07,136 --> 02:53:11,732
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

1440
02:53:14,136 --> 02:53:17,526
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1441
02:53:17,736 --> 02:53:19,692
I told you, no such treaty exists.

1442
02:53:19,936 --> 02:53:24,214
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1443
02:53:24,416 --> 02:53:26,372
I know this treaty does exist.

1444
02:53:26,576 --> 02:53:27,565
Treaty, sir?

1445
02:53:30,536 --> 02:53:32,447
He does it better than you, general.

1446
02:53:32,696 --> 02:53:35,847
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1447
02:53:49,456 --> 02:53:51,014
You really don't know?

1448
02:53:53,216 --> 02:53:55,127
Then what the devil's this?

1449
02:53:56,136 --> 02:53:59,845
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1450
02:54:00,056 --> 02:54:03,765
Why? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1451
02:54:03,976 --> 02:54:05,045
No.

1452
02:54:06,016 --> 02:54:09,053
-I can guess.
-Don't guess. Tell him.

1453
02:54:10,776 --> 02:54:12,129
Well, now....

1454
02:54:12,536 --> 02:54:15,448
Mr. Sykes is as English civil servant.

1455
02:54:15,696 --> 02:54:18,654
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1456
02:54:18,856 --> 02:54:22,895
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1457
02:54:23,136 --> 02:54:26,367
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1458
02:54:26,616 --> 02:54:28,288
Including Arabia.

1459
02:54:28,536 --> 02:54:32,449
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1460
02:54:32,656 --> 02:54:35,648
An agreement to that effect.

1461
02:54:36,256 --> 02:54:39,692
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1462
02:54:39,936 --> 02:54:42,575
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1463
02:54:42,816 --> 02:54:45,808
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1464
02:54:46,296 --> 02:54:49,493
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1465
02:54:49,696 --> 02:54:53,974
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1466
02:54:54,216 --> 02:54:58,732
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1467
02:54:59,296 --> 02:55:02,447
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1468
02:55:02,936 --> 02:55:05,245
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1469
02:55:06,656 --> 02:55:08,567
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1470
02:55:08,816 --> 02:55:11,046
That's my reason for resigning.

1471
02:55:12,296 --> 02:55:13,854
It's personal.

1472
02:55:14,056 --> 02:55:16,172
-Personal?
-Yes, sir.

1473
02:55:16,416 --> 02:55:19,374
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1474
02:55:19,616 --> 02:55:22,847
And as it happens,
a damned important one. Are you mad?

1475
02:55:23,096 --> 02:55:26,168
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1476
02:55:26,416 --> 02:55:27,644
That's my reason too.

1477
02:55:28,536 --> 02:55:33,371
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...

1478
02:55:33,576 --> 02:55:35,453
...and you are part of it.

1479
02:55:35,936 --> 02:55:39,451
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1480
02:55:39,696 --> 02:55:43,405
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1481
02:55:44,136 --> 02:55:46,092
What about your Arab friends?

1482
02:55:46,296 --> 02:55:49,971
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1483
02:55:50,176 --> 02:55:52,292
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1484
02:55:52,496 --> 02:55:57,411
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1485
02:55:57,656 --> 02:56:00,454
-Lawrence.
-Yes?

1486
02:56:03,056 --> 02:56:05,695
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1487
02:56:05,936 --> 02:56:07,972
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1488
02:56:08,216 --> 02:56:09,854
Thank you, sir.

1489
02:56:10,896 --> 02:56:13,012
Why don't we...?

1490
02:56:15,496 --> 02:56:17,248
There's blood on your back.

1491
02:56:18,456 --> 02:56:21,448
-Do you want a doctor?
-No.

1492
02:56:22,576 --> 02:56:24,646
Tell me what happened.

1493
02:56:29,416 --> 02:56:31,452
Say, what goes on in there?

1494
02:56:32,216 --> 02:56:34,047
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on!

1495
02:56:34,256 --> 02:56:37,566
-No, really. Nothing at all.
-Is the man in trouble?

1496
02:56:37,776 --> 02:56:41,564
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1497
02:56:41,816 --> 02:56:45,525
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1498
02:56:45,776 --> 02:56:49,052
-What claim?
-I've made that boy a hero.

1499
02:56:49,296 --> 02:56:51,890
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1500
02:56:52,136 --> 02:56:56,254
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1501
02:56:56,736 --> 02:56:59,455
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1502
02:57:00,016 --> 02:57:02,371
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1503
02:57:02,616 --> 02:57:05,289
Always walking away, aren't you?

1504
02:57:05,536 --> 02:57:07,015
Well, I'll tell you.

1505
02:57:07,216 --> 02:57:10,049
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1506
02:57:10,256 --> 02:57:13,054
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1507
02:57:13,296 --> 02:57:15,935
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1508
02:57:16,736 --> 02:57:19,648
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1509
02:57:20,136 --> 02:57:23,651
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1510
02:57:24,496 --> 02:57:27,249
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1511
02:57:27,856 --> 02:57:29,289
Leave me alone.

1512
02:57:29,536 --> 02:57:31,970
-Leave me alone.
-That's a feeble thing to say.

1513
02:57:32,176 --> 02:57:34,644
-I know I'm not ordinary.
-That's not what I'm saying.

1514
02:57:34,896 --> 02:57:37,535
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1515
02:57:39,456 --> 02:57:40,491
What of it?

1516
02:57:40,856 --> 02:57:43,450
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1517
02:57:43,656 --> 02:57:46,648
It's a terrible thing
for a man to funk it if he has.

1518
02:57:46,856 --> 02:57:48,892
Are you speaking from experience?

1519
02:57:49,176 --> 02:57:50,291
No.

1520
02:57:50,656 --> 02:57:52,453
You're guessing, then.

1521
02:57:53,536 --> 02:57:54,855
Suppose you're wrong.

1522
02:57:55,096 --> 02:57:58,054
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1523
02:57:58,816 --> 02:58:01,649
-Yes. I said, yes.
-After all--

1524
02:58:04,136 --> 02:58:05,125
The 16th?

1525
02:58:05,456 --> 02:58:08,254
Can you do it?
I'll give you a lot of money.

1526
02:58:08,536 --> 02:58:11,255
-Artillery?
-I can't.

1527
02:58:12,416 --> 02:58:15,249
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1528
02:58:15,536 --> 02:58:17,652
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1529
02:58:18,696 --> 02:58:20,652
Which I'm going to give them.

1530
02:58:21,336 --> 02:58:23,054
That's all I want.

1531
02:58:24,056 --> 02:58:26,854
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1532
02:58:27,056 --> 02:58:31,174
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1533
02:58:31,416 --> 02:58:34,453
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1534
02:58:34,696 --> 02:58:36,971
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1535
02:58:37,176 --> 02:58:38,450
Fair enough.

1536
02:58:38,936 --> 02:58:41,734
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1537
02:58:42,416 --> 02:58:44,247
It's going to happen.

1538
02:58:44,936 --> 02:58:46,927
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1539
02:58:47,616 --> 02:58:49,254
All there is.

1540
02:58:49,736 --> 02:58:51,249
Not that much.

1541
02:58:54,416 --> 02:58:57,055
The best of them won't come for money.

1542
02:58:58,976 --> 02:59:00,204
They'll come for me.

1543
02:59:17,936 --> 02:59:19,164
No pictures!

1544
02:59:19,416 --> 02:59:21,646
It's not for you, it's for Lawrence.

1545
02:59:21,896 --> 02:59:25,889
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1546
02:59:26,096 --> 02:59:28,246
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1547
02:59:32,536 --> 02:59:35,050
Have you met Lawrence
since he's come back?

1548
02:59:35,296 --> 02:59:36,285
Yes.

1549
02:59:36,496 --> 02:59:38,964
-Changed, hasn't he?
-No.

1550
02:59:39,176 --> 02:59:41,929
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1551
02:59:46,536 --> 02:59:50,051
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1552
02:59:50,736 --> 02:59:55,287
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1553
02:59:56,936 --> 02:59:59,370
What did the English
do to him in Jerusalem?

1554
02:59:59,616 --> 03:00:01,254
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1555
03:00:01,456 --> 03:00:03,287
-I did.
-What did he say?

1556
03:00:03,536 --> 03:00:05,049
He laughed.

1557
03:00:05,536 --> 03:00:08,050
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1558
03:00:08,616 --> 03:00:10,095
He offered me money.

1559
03:00:10,336 --> 03:00:11,849
Did you take it?

1560
03:00:12,616 --> 03:00:15,084
No. But many did.

1561
03:00:51,296 --> 03:00:54,254
-What is this?
-This is my bodyguard.

1562
03:00:54,896 --> 03:00:57,456
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1563
03:00:57,696 --> 03:01:01,166
-There's a price on my head too.
-But these are murderers.

1564
03:01:01,416 --> 03:01:03,293
The sheiks will hang these men.

1565
03:01:03,536 --> 03:01:05,254
These men are mine.

1566
03:01:05,736 --> 03:01:09,888
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1567
03:01:10,216 --> 03:01:13,492
-You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
-Sherif?

1568
03:01:13,736 --> 03:01:16,569
-Where do we ride?
-Damascus, sherif.

1569
03:01:16,816 --> 03:01:18,613
Aye, but for what?

1570
03:01:18,816 --> 03:01:20,932
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1571
03:01:23,896 --> 03:01:27,093
-You have bought these things.
-I bought half the men here, Ali.

1572
03:01:27,336 --> 03:01:29,975
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1573
03:01:30,216 --> 03:01:33,049
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1574
03:01:36,896 --> 03:01:38,648
Damascus!

1575
03:01:38,896 --> 03:01:40,887
Damascus! Damascus!

1576
03:01:41,136 --> 03:01:44,048
Damascus! Damascus!

1577
03:02:16,536 --> 03:02:19,972
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1578
03:02:20,216 --> 03:02:23,686
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1579
03:02:23,896 --> 03:02:27,445
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--

1580
03:02:27,656 --> 03:02:28,452
Certainly.

1581
03:02:28,656 --> 03:02:30,408
He can't be far from Mallud...

1582
03:02:31,056 --> 03:02:35,174
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1583
03:02:35,416 --> 03:02:37,327
Splendid. Philip.

1584
03:02:37,736 --> 03:02:40,296
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1585
03:02:40,536 --> 03:02:43,926
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1586
03:02:44,616 --> 03:02:48,086
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1587
03:02:48,296 --> 03:02:49,285
Any questions?

1588
03:02:49,736 --> 03:02:53,649
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1589
03:02:54,136 --> 03:02:56,252
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1590
03:02:56,456 --> 03:02:58,253
Where are they now?

1591
03:02:58,936 --> 03:03:03,646
-Can only know by being with them.
-Then get with them. I want to know.

1592
03:03:03,936 --> 03:03:06,131
Pound them, Charley.

1593
03:03:06,736 --> 03:03:08,055
Pound them.

1594
03:03:18,216 --> 03:03:20,889
God help the men who lie under that.

1595
03:03:21,136 --> 03:03:22,694
They're Turks.

1596
03:03:22,896 --> 03:03:24,488
God help them.

1597
03:04:05,456 --> 03:04:09,051
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1598
03:04:09,296 --> 03:04:10,285
Cocky?

1599
03:04:10,696 --> 03:04:12,448
More than cocky, sir.

1600
03:04:12,696 --> 03:04:15,893
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1601
03:04:16,136 --> 03:04:19,446
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1602
03:04:20,096 --> 03:04:21,848
-Unless....
-Unless?

1603
03:04:22,056 --> 03:04:25,765
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1604
03:04:26,016 --> 03:04:28,849
-What do the Turks have in Mazril?
-A brigade, sir.

1605
03:04:31,736 --> 03:04:33,852
I wonder where they are now.

1606
03:06:11,736 --> 03:06:12,851
No prisoners.

1607
03:06:16,216 --> 03:06:18,252
Damascus, Lawrence.

1608
03:06:27,736 --> 03:06:30,455
Lawrence, not this.

1609
03:06:31,136 --> 03:06:35,015
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1610
03:06:35,696 --> 03:06:37,254
No prisoners.

1611
03:06:46,936 --> 03:06:48,494
This was Talaal's village.

1612
03:06:52,536 --> 03:06:54,447
Talaal!

1613
03:07:04,056 --> 03:07:05,250
Talaal!

1614
03:07:13,936 --> 03:07:15,847
No prisoners!

1615
03:07:16,296 --> 03:07:17,331
No prisoners!

1616
03:07:28,736 --> 03:07:29,725
God.

1617
03:07:33,616 --> 03:07:34,651
God.

1618
03:07:36,696 --> 03:07:37,845
God!

1619
03:09:49,696 --> 03:09:52,733
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1620
03:11:26,136 --> 03:11:27,330
Major!

1621
03:11:27,936 --> 03:11:29,528
Major Lawrence!

1622
03:11:34,976 --> 03:11:36,534
Jesus wept.

1623
03:11:51,496 --> 03:11:52,690
Jesus wept.

1624
03:11:54,536 --> 03:11:56,492
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1625
03:11:57,096 --> 03:11:59,735
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1626
03:11:59,976 --> 03:12:01,728
Barbarous and cruel.

1627
03:12:02,496 --> 03:12:04,327
Who but they?

1628
03:12:04,696 --> 03:12:05,970
Who but they?

1629
03:12:08,216 --> 03:12:10,525
Oh, you rotten man.

1630
03:12:11,536 --> 03:12:15,734
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1631
03:12:17,776 --> 03:12:19,767
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1632
03:12:45,176 --> 03:12:48,532
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1633
03:12:48,976 --> 03:12:50,568
Damascus!

1634
03:12:50,776 --> 03:12:52,573
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1635
03:12:52,816 --> 03:12:54,135
Tell him.

1636
03:12:55,096 --> 03:12:56,734
Remind him.

1637
03:12:57,576 --> 03:13:00,534
-Is Allenby in Damascus?
-Near.

1638
03:13:01,336 --> 03:13:03,531
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1639
03:13:04,776 --> 03:13:06,528
They are not ripe.

1640
03:13:12,216 --> 03:13:14,172
General salute!

1641
03:13:14,376 --> 03:13:16,526
Present arms!

1642
03:13:30,296 --> 03:13:32,093
Port arms!

1643
03:13:34,776 --> 03:13:36,573
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1644
03:13:36,816 --> 03:13:39,535
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1645
03:13:45,616 --> 03:13:47,334
-When?
-A day and a night, sir.

1646
03:13:47,536 --> 03:13:49,333
They've been here a day and a night.

1647
03:13:49,576 --> 03:13:51,965
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1648
03:13:52,216 --> 03:13:55,925
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1649
03:13:56,816 --> 03:13:58,568
What else beside the town hall?

1650
03:13:58,816 --> 03:14:01,569
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1651
03:14:01,816 --> 03:14:04,125
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1652
03:14:04,336 --> 03:14:07,134
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1653
03:14:07,336 --> 03:14:08,928
...and they're in the town hall.

1654
03:14:09,176 --> 03:14:11,929
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1655
03:14:13,576 --> 03:14:14,975
What should we do?

1656
03:14:15,216 --> 03:14:17,491
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1657
03:14:18,336 --> 03:14:20,133
How about that, Dryden?

1658
03:14:21,816 --> 03:14:24,455
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1659
03:14:25,176 --> 03:14:28,088
-What, then?
-When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1660
03:14:28,296 --> 03:14:30,252
By special train in two days' time.

1661
03:14:30,496 --> 03:14:31,531
Two days.

1662
03:14:31,736 --> 03:14:35,172
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1663
03:14:35,416 --> 03:14:37,372
-Isn't it enough?
-Yes.

1664
03:14:37,576 --> 03:14:40,852
-Ample, I should think.
-We can't just do nothing.

1665
03:14:41,096 --> 03:14:44,566
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1666
03:14:44,816 --> 03:14:48,934
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1667
03:14:49,296 --> 03:14:50,854
Does that apply to technical units?

1668
03:14:51,096 --> 03:14:53,132
Technical units particularly.

1669
03:14:53,376 --> 03:14:54,570
Yes, sir.

1670
03:14:55,216 --> 03:14:56,569
Medicals too, sir?

1671
03:14:56,816 --> 03:14:58,932
I'm af raid so, Harry.

1672
03:14:59,256 --> 03:15:00,928
Medicals too.

1673
03:15:39,616 --> 03:15:41,129
We here...

1674
03:15:41,336 --> 03:15:44,089
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1675
03:15:44,296 --> 03:15:47,333
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1676
03:15:47,616 --> 03:15:50,926
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1677
03:15:51,176 --> 03:15:53,132
He insulted me.

1678
03:15:54,216 --> 03:15:58,129
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1679
03:15:58,376 --> 03:16:01,095
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1680
03:16:01,536 --> 03:16:05,131
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1681
03:16:05,336 --> 03:16:08,726
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1682
03:16:11,096 --> 03:16:13,326
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1683
03:16:14,216 --> 03:16:17,526
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1684
03:16:20,176 --> 03:16:23,930
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1685
03:16:24,176 --> 03:16:25,325
Humbly?

1686
03:16:25,816 --> 03:16:27,169
Humbly, Harith?

1687
03:16:27,416 --> 03:16:29,327
Yes, humbly.

1688
03:16:29,696 --> 03:16:31,732
This is a new trick.

1689
03:16:32,696 --> 03:16:34,288
Why is there no electricity?

1690
03:16:35,216 --> 03:16:37,855
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1691
03:16:38,096 --> 03:16:40,849
There are three large machines.

1692
03:16:41,096 --> 03:16:43,326
He means generators!

1693
03:16:43,816 --> 03:16:44,931
So.

1694
03:16:45,336 --> 03:16:46,974
One of them is burning.

1695
03:16:47,216 --> 03:16:50,208
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1696
03:16:50,496 --> 03:16:53,135
It is so of all machines.

1697
03:16:53,336 --> 03:16:57,170
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1698
03:16:59,736 --> 03:17:02,773
-The need is absolute.
-Then we need English engineers.

1699
03:17:03,016 --> 03:17:06,531
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1700
03:17:06,776 --> 03:17:07,925
Take--

1701
03:17:11,896 --> 03:17:13,090
Fire has broken out.

1702
03:17:13,296 --> 03:17:14,775
-Where?
-The Jinsibi district.

1703
03:17:15,016 --> 03:17:17,769
-It is not a district that matters.
-It will spread!

1704
03:17:18,016 --> 03:17:19,654
Then use the fire brigade!

1705
03:17:19,896 --> 03:17:22,649
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1706
03:17:22,896 --> 03:17:24,329
Then you must carry it.

1707
03:17:24,576 --> 03:17:28,728
-The Ruala do not carry water.
-What else are they good for?

1708
03:17:40,536 --> 03:17:43,926
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1709
03:17:46,696 --> 03:17:48,334
This afternoon!

1710
03:18:11,096 --> 03:18:14,930
-I'll take this up after the war.
-Surely we should do something, sir.

1711
03:18:15,136 --> 03:18:18,924
-It's an old man's sport.
-Are you an old man, sir?

1712
03:18:19,136 --> 03:18:21,934
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1713
03:18:23,336 --> 03:18:24,564
Sorry, sir.

1714
03:18:26,736 --> 03:18:28,328
Maybe it's the bulb.

1715
03:18:32,816 --> 03:18:33,931
No, sir.

1716
03:18:34,336 --> 03:18:35,928
It's the power.

1717
03:18:50,496 --> 03:18:51,849
They're leaving.

1718
03:18:52,496 --> 03:18:54,134
That's it, then.

1719
03:18:54,616 --> 03:18:56,652
Marvellous-Iooking beggars,
aren't they?

1720
03:19:16,976 --> 03:19:19,729
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1721
03:19:20,016 --> 03:19:21,927
-Come where?
-Back.

1722
03:19:26,176 --> 03:19:28,326
I know your heart.

1723
03:19:36,416 --> 03:19:37,974
What is it?

1724
03:19:38,936 --> 03:19:40,528
Is it this?

1725
03:19:43,176 --> 03:19:46,134
I tell you, this is nothing.

1726
03:19:58,776 --> 03:20:00,368
Is it the blood?

1727
03:20:01,136 --> 03:20:04,128
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1728
03:20:05,616 --> 03:20:09,768
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1729
03:20:10,816 --> 03:20:12,044
Hear me, God.

1730
03:20:13,696 --> 03:20:17,371
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1731
03:20:33,576 --> 03:20:34,770
What about you?

1732
03:20:35,736 --> 03:20:39,206
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1733
03:20:41,616 --> 03:20:42,935
A very low occupation.

1734
03:20:43,416 --> 03:20:46,328
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1735
03:20:54,936 --> 03:20:57,734
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1736
03:20:57,936 --> 03:20:59,733
It's what I came for.

1737
03:21:03,096 --> 03:21:04,324
And then...

1738
03:21:06,616 --> 03:21:07,935
...it would be something.

1739
03:21:08,176 --> 03:21:09,325
Yes.

1740
03:21:09,976 --> 03:21:11,125
Much.

1741
03:21:29,416 --> 03:21:31,725
-He is your friend?
-Take your hand away.

1742
03:21:31,936 --> 03:21:33,164
-You love him.
-I fear him.

1743
03:21:33,416 --> 03:21:35,134
Then why do you weep?

1744
03:21:35,496 --> 03:21:37,532
If I fear him, who love him...

1745
03:21:37,736 --> 03:21:40,534
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1746
03:21:40,896 --> 03:21:43,888
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1747
03:21:46,216 --> 03:21:49,526
So you are not yet
entirely politician.

1748
03:21:49,776 --> 03:21:50,572
Not yet.

1749
03:21:50,816 --> 03:21:54,968
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1750
03:21:55,536 --> 03:21:57,333
And Allah be thanked.

1751
03:21:57,816 --> 03:21:59,169
I'll tell thee what...

1752
03:21:59,416 --> 03:22:02,613
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1753
03:22:23,216 --> 03:22:26,413
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1754
03:22:26,696 --> 03:22:29,369
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1755
03:22:29,616 --> 03:22:33,768
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1756
03:22:34,016 --> 03:22:36,928
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1757
03:22:37,176 --> 03:22:38,689
No, sir, I will not.

1758
03:22:39,576 --> 03:22:41,134
Control yourself.

1759
03:22:41,616 --> 03:22:44,574
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1760
03:22:45,496 --> 03:22:47,691
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1761
03:22:47,896 --> 03:22:50,615
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1762
03:22:50,976 --> 03:22:55,254
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1763
03:22:55,896 --> 03:23:00,333
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1764
03:23:06,776 --> 03:23:08,175
What's it like?

1765
03:24:21,856 --> 03:24:23,847
This is outrageous!

1766
03:24:24,896 --> 03:24:26,727
Outrageous!

1767
03:24:29,816 --> 03:24:31,488
Outrageous!

1768
03:24:32,536 --> 03:24:34,652
You filthy little wog!

1769
03:24:44,736 --> 03:24:48,649
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1770
03:24:48,896 --> 03:24:51,251
" My friend Lawrence."

1771
03:24:51,496 --> 03:24:55,887
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1772
03:24:56,096 --> 03:24:58,656
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1773
03:24:58,896 --> 03:25:03,765
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1774
03:25:04,016 --> 03:25:07,486
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1775
03:25:07,736 --> 03:25:11,092
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1776
03:25:11,336 --> 03:25:14,646
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1777
03:25:15,536 --> 03:25:17,652
You're promoted colonel.

1778
03:25:17,856 --> 03:25:20,211
Yes. What for?

1779
03:25:20,416 --> 03:25:23,488
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1780
03:25:23,696 --> 03:25:27,655
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1781
03:25:28,216 --> 03:25:30,411
Then, thank you.

1782
03:25:34,456 --> 03:25:35,650
Well, then...

1783
03:25:36,216 --> 03:25:37,205
...Godspeed.

1784
03:25:37,696 --> 03:25:41,450
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1785
03:25:41,736 --> 03:25:45,649
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1786
03:25:45,896 --> 03:25:50,094
Young men make wars, and the virtues
of war are the virtues of young men.

1787
03:25:50,336 --> 03:25:53,646
Courage and hope for the future.

1788
03:25:53,856 --> 03:25:56,450
Then old men make the peace.

1789
03:25:57,496 --> 03:26:00,294
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1790
03:26:00,496 --> 03:26:02,851
Mistrust and caution.

1791
03:26:03,736 --> 03:26:05,488
It must be so.

1792
03:26:21,256 --> 03:26:25,647
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1793
03:26:35,016 --> 03:26:38,531
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1794
03:26:38,776 --> 03:26:40,448
The pumping plant I must retain.

1795
03:26:40,656 --> 03:26:43,090
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1796
03:26:43,336 --> 03:26:46,885
-I shall be glad of assistance.
-Then you must bring down your flag.

1797
03:26:47,136 --> 03:26:50,845
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1798
03:26:51,096 --> 03:26:52,688
-Have you men?
-Enough of that.

1799
03:26:52,896 --> 03:26:55,205
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1800
03:26:55,536 --> 03:26:57,288
I'm sure your government...

1801
03:26:57,536 --> 03:27:01,245
...does not wish to appear at
the peace conference as an aggressor.

1802
03:27:03,416 --> 03:27:04,849
I say!

1803
03:27:06,216 --> 03:27:08,047
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1804
03:27:10,296 --> 03:27:12,446
May I shake your hand, sir?

1805
03:27:13,536 --> 03:27:16,050
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1806
03:27:19,536 --> 03:27:21,652
Haven't we met before?

1807
03:27:21,896 --> 03:27:23,409
Don't think so, sir.

1808
03:27:23,616 --> 03:27:26,255
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1809
03:27:31,256 --> 03:27:35,249
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1810
03:27:35,456 --> 03:27:37,367
They have no power. It's illusory.

1811
03:27:37,616 --> 03:27:39,971
Illusions can be very powerf ul.

1812
03:27:40,336 --> 03:27:41,849
Particularly...

1813
03:27:42,736 --> 03:27:45,250
...when they take this form.

1814
03:27:47,296 --> 03:27:50,174
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1815
03:27:50,416 --> 03:27:52,293
...liberated by the Arab army.

1816
03:27:52,816 --> 03:27:55,728
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1817
03:27:56,256 --> 03:28:01,091
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1818
03:28:01,336 --> 03:28:04,248
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1819
03:28:07,736 --> 03:28:09,852
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1820
03:28:10,656 --> 03:28:12,851
You are merely a general.

1821
03:28:15,336 --> 03:28:16,769
I must be a king.

1822
03:28:19,656 --> 03:28:21,453
Excuse me, sir.

1823
03:28:35,496 --> 03:28:36,690
Well?

1824
03:28:37,536 --> 03:28:38,889
Well...

1825
03:28:39,296 --> 03:28:42,094
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1826
03:28:42,296 --> 03:28:44,446
...with an Arab flag on it.

1827
03:28:44,656 --> 03:28:46,487
Do you think it was worth it?

1828
03:28:46,696 --> 03:28:49,210
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1829
03:28:49,536 --> 03:28:50,685
Yes, sir.

1830
03:28:50,936 --> 03:28:52,494
So you keep saying.

1831
03:28:52,696 --> 03:28:54,254
You, I suspect...

1832
03:28:54,736 --> 03:28:58,445
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1833
03:28:58,896 --> 03:29:01,854
-What do you think?
-Me, Your Highness?

1834
03:29:02,536 --> 03:29:06,609
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1835
03:29:43,096 --> 03:29:46,054
Well, sir. Going home.

1836
03:29:48,296 --> 03:29:49,854
Home, sir.

1837
03:29:56,616 --> 03:30:00,052
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you

1838
03:30:00,296 --> 03:30:03,333
Though it breaks my heart to go

1839
03:32:07,696 --> 03:32:08,685
