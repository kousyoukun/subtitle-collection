OK.

This is an accident victim
creamed by a truck.

That's one of the advantages
of working in a chem lab.

92
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:15,290
I finally figured it out. Every three days
that I stay awake, I gain 24 hours.

93
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:17,961
That's 122 days every year.

So even if I die at 50,
I will have lived 65 years.

Their name was Patterson.

I've made a formulation based on human

Is the monkey responding? Is it any

00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:56,058
Five.

162
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,486
Seven.

163
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,785
Fuck! Eight!

164
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:27,757
Six.

165

Yo, Ace! Ace,
I'm gonna grab a brew. Do you want one?

166

<i>(sirens wail)

167
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,571
- Tofranil. Same dosage?
- No.

168
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:34,159
Four times a day for the first two days,
twice a day after that.

169
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:38,082
So... What are your plans?

170
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,586
No plans.

171
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:45,044
I was going to fly home back to Illinois
next week, but...

172
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:48,886
I can't go now, not now.

173
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:52,514
- What if Allan?
- Tries this again?

174
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,593
You're not going to prevent it
by being here. Look at today.

175
00:21:57,857 --> 00:22:00,693
I know it might be difficult
to understand,

176
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,402
but you might actually be aggravating
the situation.

177
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,944
- Aggravating?
- Go home, Dorothy. Go back to Illinois.

178
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,117
Go back to your business.

179
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:15,825
You'll make it easier on yourself
and on Allan.

180
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,827
He'll be fine.
Clinical depression syndrome.

181
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:24,839
Tryptizol I had him on was too weak.
I'm switching him to Tofranil.

182
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,212
Allan Mann.

183
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:33,970
This isn't unusual. Six out of ten
quadriplegics attempt suicide.

184
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,475
And you pump them full of Tofranil.

185
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,441
Have you seen Wiseman?

186
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,394
He's right over there.

187
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,858
- Geoffrey?
- It's Allan. He tried to kill himself.

188
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,950
Wait. You didn't know?

189
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,124
- Then what are you doing here?
- She came to pick me up.

190
00:22:56,626 --> 00:23:01,087
Well, I'll be damned.
How do we diagnose this one, Wiseman?

191
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:05,259
Clinical asshole syndrome? Clinical rat?
Clinical snake in the grass?

192
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,920
- Come on, Geoffrey...
- And you? You clinical cunt.

193
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,852
OK, Scooter. Come on now. Drink. Drink.

194
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:27,532
OK. Put your baby to bed. Drink.

195
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,327
No, not for baby. Drink for me.

196

00:23:58,064 --> 00:24:00,982
Yes. Yes. Good girl!

205
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:18,827
- Hi. I'm Melanie.
- Hi. Geoffrey Fisher. Nice to meet you.

206
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:23,504
- What a fabulous place you have here.
- Thanks. I'm lucky to have it.

207
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:27,582
- You wanna come in or stay out here?
- I'll stay out.

208

Although my system may go into shock -
all it ever gets is fluorescent light.

209
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:37,394
So you train monkeys?
Exclusively for quadriplegics?

210
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:41,222
There's no time for anything else -
the programme's so popular.

211
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:47,444
As I told you on the phone, I have a friend
who would be a terrific candidate for this.

212
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:53,030
There are a lot of candidates. All
my monkeys are already assigned homes.

213
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:58,786
How about if I were to donate a monkey?
One from the lab at the college?

214
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,836
Has to be a female.
Males are too unsanitary.

215
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:05,297
They go around peeing
to mark their territory.

216
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:12,093
I know. I've had my share of drenchings.
It's all right. This one is a female.

217
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:18,179
Well, I suppose if you're willing to supply
the animal, it comes down to my time.

218
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:22,892
- I could pay you. I don't have much...
- No. I draw a salary from a grant.

219
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:25,233
It's just squeezing them in.

220
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:29,859
Starting a monkey from scratch
is a long process.

221
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:34,322
This monkey's pretty well conditioned.
She's very bright.

222
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:39,117
She's already been through
a lot of behavioural training.

223
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,751
It sounds too good to be true.

224
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:49,543
She's normal? She hasn't been exposed
to anything weird in the lab?

225
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,926
No. She gets a med check every day.
She's 100%.

She's all yours, Ace. A present.

You serious? You're giving me a monkey?

- How am I supposed to take care of her?
- It's gonna take care of you.

Melanie's been training her.

I'll attach a gizmo to your chair

- Number six.

That's a shit name.

242
00:27:10,054 --> 00:27:14,466
She's a capuchin - <i>Cebus Apella.</i>
I've been calling her Ella.

243
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,091
Ella, huh? It's a little better.

244
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:23,397
- Hi. I'm Melanie. You're Allan's nurse?
- God has given me that burden, yes.

245
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:26,811
Could you give me a hand?
I got a truck load out here.

246
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:34,651
Listen. I kinda smuggled her
out of the lab.

247
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:39,746
Officially, she's dead,
but nobody knows that - not even Melanie.

248
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:43,162
So if you could keep that quiet,
I'd appreciate it.

Hey, Ella.

I can't, but I sure would love to.

I'm gonna do it, darlin'.
I'm gonna go back to school.

I know. I love you too.

333

I want to spoil her. She's really...

337

to want to do things just for me.

341

Great.

- This is Ella. That's my girl.

Ella's your girl?

353
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:39,465
June 12, 1984 - the Supreme Court
reversed the sixth circuit court of appeal

354
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:43,927
in a case involving the City of Memphis.

355
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:46,722

Well, Mr Mann,
does your friend know the answer?

359
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,040
Or do you?

360
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:14,373
The ruling held that courts could
not upset valid seniority systems

361
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:17,047
to protect the rights of minority workers.

- Yeah. Each card dials a number.

372
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:28,328
Ella does it for me. She already
knows which cards are which.

373

Fear of drowning, for example,

back and I still don't have a replacement.

if I'm on to something.

I should have gotten that monkey -
the one that died.

- She's just hiding. Probably in the attic.
- Cos you're after her all the time.

477
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:39,582
You killed my Bogie!

478
00:50:41,047 --> 00:50:43,087
Maryanne, you're confused.

479
00:50:43,216 --> 00:50:46,965
Not with his hands.
He had his little demon do it for him.

480
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:53,180
- Ella was in her cage.
- I don't know how you did it, but you did!

481
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:58,185
The two of you together.
And now my little Bogie is gone!

482
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:03,941
Maybe it was old age, huh?
Maybe it was a rat that got it.

483
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:09,863
Maybe you crushed it when you jammed
your foot in the slipper. Who gives a shit?

484
00:51:10,702 --> 00:51:12,991
It deserved to die.

485
00:51:13,122 --> 00:51:16,325
It fucking deserved to die.

486
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,626
Allan?

487
00:51:26,636 --> 00:51:28,213
Oh.

488
00:51:37,939 --> 00:51:40,691
This is embarrassing.
I'd rather Maryanne do this.

489
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:45,395
What's the matter?
I've never seen you naked? Come on.

490
00:51:46,489 --> 00:51:49,159
Anyway, you're stuck with me.

491
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:53,280
- Maryanne's leaving.
- Maryanne's leaving?

492
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:56,367
- Uh-huh.
- You mean while you're here?

493
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:02,336
No, she's quitting. She called me last
week and said she was looking for work.

494
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:04,504
Last week?

495
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:13,717
- Bitch.
- Allan, it's all right.

496
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:16,603
Actually, her timing couldn't be better.

497
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:20,228
Her decision helped me
reach a decision of my own -

498
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:23,109
one that I've been procrastinating about...

499
00:52:23,235 --> 00:52:24,943
What is it?

500
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:27,562
Well... I hope you approve.

501
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:33,120
I've sold my business.
I'm selling the house in Lake Forest.

502
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:35,571
You're planning on moving in?

503
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:42,039
It's the only solution, Allan.
Don't worry. I'll stay out of your way.

504
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:45,541
I know you're a very private person.

505
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:53,218
At the same time, I'll be able to help.
I'll be here when you need me.

506
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:59,603
Mother... Mother, my hand moved.

507
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:02,683
- Did you see it?
- Allan, please...

508
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:05,487
Did you see my fucking hand move
or didn't you?!

509
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:11,366
No, I did not. There is nothing to see.
Your hand did not move. It cannot move.

510
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:15,946
I don't like the way you're behaving.
I don't like it at all.

511
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:45,145

512

<i>Want anything?

513
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:56,779
Uh... No. No, Mother. I'm all right.

514
00:53:56,915 --> 00:54:02,586

- No, I'm all right. Just leave me alone.

515
00:54:05,132 --> 00:54:07,919
Just leave me alone.

516
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:24,309
You can get out of this cage, can't you?
You can get out of this house.

517
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:15,234
Ella... you little devil, you.

518
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:22,794
Nothing. There's no way
she could be getting out.

519
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,494
She's coming in wet, covered with mud.

520
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:28,835
Allan, look at me. The attic is a mess.

521
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:31,755
Leaks in the roof.
It's been raining in there.

522
00:55:31,888 --> 00:55:36,301
Ella is getting out of the house.
If it's not the attic, it's some other way.

523
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:39,104
And I'm getting out with her.

524
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:44,983
These dreams I've been having... They're
not dreams. It's more like experiences.

525
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,731
It's like I'm in Ella's body.

526
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:51,695
Running with her strength.
Seeing through her eyes.

527
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:57,821
- I'm part of her. She's part of me.
- You do know that that's impossible.

528
00:55:57,956 --> 00:56:02,168
No, I don't know.
It is not impossible. It's happening.

529
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:04,785
You're talking about telepathy, Ace.

530
00:56:04,922 --> 00:56:07,923
Some sort of mind meld. Come on.

531
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:13,839
I know there's a strong bond between you
and Ella, but... paranormal contact?

532
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:16,511
It's impossible. It just can't be.

533
00:56:16,642 --> 00:56:21,185
Allan, are you all right?
Do I need to start worrying about you?

534
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:26,106
No, I'm fine.
Just an overactive imagination, I guess.

535
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:39,992
My hand moved - I saw it move -
but Wiseman says that's impossible.

536
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:44,170
You should always get a second opinion
with something serious.

537
00:56:44,296 --> 00:56:47,083
Even with the brilliant John Wiseman.

538
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:50,964
- Do I detect a note of sarcasm?
- Wiseman's overconfident.

539
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:55,840
- Sometimes he... misses things.
- He missed something with Allan?

540
00:56:55,974 --> 00:57:00,601
I don't know, but it looks to me
like you've got a congenital problem.

541
00:57:00,729 --> 00:57:03,351
This injury here
was caused by the accident -

542
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:07,480
it's what Wiseman repaired
and it looks like a competent job.

543
00:57:07,611 --> 00:57:12,487
But I don't think this is what's
causing your paralysis. See this?

544
00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:16,449
This abnormality doesn't look
like it was caused by trauma.

545
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:19,450
If this is the culprit...

546
00:57:19,582 --> 00:57:25,621
then your paralysis could have come on
crossing the street, lying in bed.

547
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:28,542
The accident could have been
a tragic coincidence.

548
00:57:28,675 --> 00:57:29,837
Tragic?

549
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:33,800
Without the accident,
the docs might have looked harder.

550
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:38,343
They probably figured you got hit
by a truck, spinal damage, case closed.

551
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:44,681
So if they... he had looked harder
and he found what you found...

552
00:57:46,026 --> 00:57:49,110
- Could he have fixed it?
- Can you fix it?

553
00:57:49,238 --> 00:57:52,073
This is a very inexact specialty.

554
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:55,449
Let me run some more tests
before you ask me that question.

555
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:04,502
<i>- (growling)</i>
<i>- (thinks) Wiseman. That motherfucker.

00:58:10,217 --> 00:58:12,009
If he did this to me...

558
00:58:12,678 --> 00:58:17,222
If he put me through this for no fucking
reason other than his own incompetence.

559
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:22,510
- Allan. Don't waste your time on anger.
- That son of a bitch.

560
00:58:23,773 --> 00:58:26,098
Ego-fucking-maniac. I could...

561
00:58:26,234 --> 00:58:30,481
I don't understand this reaction.
You're letting bad news overshadow good.

562
00:58:30,613 --> 00:58:34,232
There's hope - not false hope, real hope.

563

Just when things
might turn your way, you...

Oh. Allan just came in.
Yes, I will. Thank you for calling.

Allan, something terrible has happened.

- There was...
- A fire.

588
01:02:57,763 --> 01:03:02,224
- Take her away.
- Ace, Ella could not have done this.

589
01:03:02,351 --> 01:03:07,346
I think she did do it. I think she did it
for me. Because I wanted it done.

590
01:03:07,482 --> 01:03:11,480
You wanted them to die in a fit of anger.
That's a normal reaction.

591
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:13,651
These people fucked you over.

592
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:18,489
Now this thing happens - it's coincidence -
and you're blaming it on yourself.

593
01:03:18,618 --> 01:03:23,114
It wasn't a fit of anger.
I thought about it - of ways of doing it.

594
01:03:23,248 --> 01:03:29,037
Fire was one of those ways. I knew that
old cabin. I knew that it would burn fast.

595
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:31,578
Allan...

596
01:03:36,303 --> 01:03:40,680
- Did you do that or did she?
- She did it. She acts on her own as well.

597
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:46,184
That worries me too. What she might do
when she's been exposed to...

598
01:03:46,313 --> 01:03:49,682
- Exposed to what?
- Geoff...

599
01:03:49,817 --> 01:03:52,225
I've been so full of anger.

600
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,067
I've had the most horrible thoughts lately.

601
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:02,026
It's like vomiting up
every resentment I ever had.

602
01:04:02,163 --> 01:04:05,864
Every ugly, vicious, sinful...

603
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:09,825
That's what it is - it's sin.

604
01:04:10,922 --> 01:04:13,460
It's the desire to sin, Geoff.

605
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:20,172
- If Ella's plugged into that...
- You did not cause that fire, nor did Ella.

606
01:04:20,307 --> 01:04:25,384
Animals are instinctively terrified of fire.
They won't go near a naked flame.

607
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:38,859
Was that an instinctive reaction?
Or does she just know what fire can do?

608
01:04:38,992 --> 01:04:41,199
Christ. All right...

609
01:04:43,038 --> 01:04:48,828
I'll take her down to the lab
and run whatever tests I can run on her.

in a urine sample.

01:09:51,272 --> 01:09:56,729
They're all getting the same dosage.
The missing ingredient must be Allan.

632
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,138
My God. You want it?

633
01:10:55,213 --> 01:10:57,585
What? No complaint?

634
01:10:59,926 --> 01:11:02,596
I've turned you into a fucking junkie.

635
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:12,137
What else have I turned you into? Has this
stuff plugged you into Allan somehow?

636
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:24,571
Seven bottles of beer on the wall.

637
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:34,033
You didn't do it, did you, Ella? All that
stuff that Allan's been blaming on you?

638
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,753
I know that you've been getting
out of the house...

639
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:41,759
but you couldn't have committed murder.

640
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,686
I don't know. I just can't be sure.

641
01:11:50,812 --> 01:11:55,723
You weren't trying to make
your hand move. It moved by itself.

642
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:59,855
Spinal surgery is risky business.

643
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:05,611
Without some proof, some more positive
sign, I can't recommend taking that risk.

644
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:08,864
- What kind of sign?
- A voluntary movement.

645
01:12:08,997 --> 01:12:11,120
A movement you make deliberately -

646
01:12:11,249 --> 01:12:14,416
even if it's only a finger or a toe.

647
01:12:14,545 --> 01:12:18,245
Show me that you can do that
and I'll say, "Let's operate."

648
01:12:32,605 --> 01:12:34,562
- Hello, Mother.
- Where have you been?

649
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,810
- At school.
- Where have you been all weekend?

650
01:12:37,944 --> 01:12:40,613
I tried to call you at least a dozen times.

651
01:12:40,738 --> 01:12:43,408
We decided not to answer the phone.

652
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:46,949
Mel, don't come in.
I just don't want any bullshit.

653
01:12:47,078 --> 01:12:49,747
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mel, don't.

654
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:52,328
I don't want any bullshit either.

655
01:12:54,419 --> 01:12:57,171
Hi, Mrs Mann. How are you today?

656
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,944
Burbage.

657
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,080
Jesus. He's got it.

658
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:36,333
He's got the serum.

Motherfucker!

660
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:56,518
Burbage won't learn anything.

661
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:59,485
Not from you, you simple bastards.

662
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:01,936
He won't learn diddly shit.

663
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:05,480

664
01:14:06,493 --> 01:14:08,735
Maybe I still can from you, sugar.

665
01:14:10,956 --> 01:14:13,114
One bottle of beer on the wall.

666
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:19,958
One last dose. Not for you this time.
This time, it's for me.

668
01:14:23,511 --> 01:14:26,215

I told him to keep her, Mother. I told him
not to bring her back. She's gone.

She did something to that girl, didn't she?

She did something to that Melanie

You'd do anything she asks in a minute.

very pleasant to be around lately.

Do you think you could do the same?

What am I supposed to fix, Allan?
What have I done?
