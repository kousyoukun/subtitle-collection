{11989}{12097}Linda, would you get this gentleman|a drink? Double Scotch?
{12100}{12206}- If I'm allowed.|- Allowed? I'm prescribing it.
{12436}{12519}Not in a regular glass. We use these.
{12575}{12715}We never use ice cubes and if|we must have alcohol, we water it down.

{19729}{19802}Ones with the pictures|of the wheelchairs on them.
{19805}{19931}- I hate to think what Mother paid for it.|- You'll pay her back. Lawyers get rich.
{19935}{19998}You look like shit. You shooting parnate?
{20001}{20086}That's one of the advantages|of working in a chem lab.
{20089}{20225}I finally figured it out. Every three days|that I stay awake, I gain 24 hours.
{20229}{20290}That's 122 days every year.
{20293}{20386}So even if I die at 50,|I will have lived 65 years.
{20491}{20629}I'm sorry I didn't make the party. Linda|called me - she sounded pretty crazed.
{20699}{20752}Linda's dumping me.
{20797}{20884}She didn't come out and say it,|but I can tell.
{20919}{21051}Allan... Linda's just not comfortable|with the change yet, that's all.
{21054}{21104}She's gonna come around.
{21163}{21237}Hey, if she walks out on you now,|fuck her.
{21240}{21291}I can't.
{21632}{21730}Oh, look! There you are|with the little Palmer children.
{21733}{21806}Patterson, Mother.|Their name was Patterson.
{21809}{21891}That's right. I'm terrible with names.
{21908}{21965}Look, there's their house.
{21968}{22039}Remember when Mr Patterson|got transferred?
{22042}{22099}I got the listing and had to sell the house.
{22103}{22222}You were so angry. You thought I had|something to do with their moving away.

{24372}{24430}- How're you doing?|- Late again.
{24433}{24494}Yes. Sorry. Lost track of the time.
{24497}{24552}Well... What have you got?
{24594}{24696}Samuels has given me a brain sample|from a young girl who died in surgery.
{24700}{24794}I've made a formulation based on human|memory cells and injected a monkey.
{24798}{24941}Is the monkey responding? Is it any|smarter than it was before it was injected?
{24945}{25048}It's very difficult to measure.|She was pretty smart to begin with.
{25051}{25131}{y:i}(laughs)|I don't believe this.
{25134}{25277}The worm studies reincarnated.|Monkeys are more expensive than worms.
{25280}{25394}- It's not costing anything.|- It's costing time, Geoffrey.
{25397}{25491}This programme|has to start showing results.
{25494}{25560}People who write|the cheques are getting nervous.
{25609}{25667}I've seen you on three different talk shows
{25670}{25755}defending the slaughter of animals|for research.
{25758}{25855}Your work has the anti-vivisectionists|ready to firebomb the college.
{25858}{25942}That's what's making the people|who write the cheques nervous.
{25946}{26001}Our approaches are quite different.
{26004}{26102}Unfortunately for you,|I'm the head of this department.
{26105}{26239}- Why don't you just fire me then?|- I don't want to fire you, Geoffrey.
{26242}{26336}- I just want to get you to produce.|- You can't do it, can you?
{26339}{26466}You can't fire me cos you know|if anybody's gonna strike gold,
{26469}{26518}it's gonna be me.
{26577}{26680}- Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. You'll live.|- {y:i}(hissing)
{26707}{26814}My ass is on the line around here, sixer.|And yours with it.
{26817}{26865}You'd better get smart.
{26943}{26993}This has to work.

{45118}{45215}Let's not call it a promise.|If I get the chance, I'll make it.
{45219}{45277}You don't like making promises.
{45280}{45342}- {y:i}(squeaking)|- What?
{45739}{45788}Ella, fetch.
{45946}{46022}Atta girl. I know it's heavy. You can do it.
{46042}{46127}Come on. Stretch for it. Make it burn.
{46129}{46209}If I'm gonna suffer this shit,|you have to suffer with me.
{46212}{46268}Worse than having an infant.
{46315}{46428}Way to go, Ella! Double reward.|No, triple reward. That was a biggie.
{46431}{46465}{y:i}(beeping)
{46468}{46565}Maryanne, I asked you|to keep this container loaded.
{46797}{46923}Rewards for that little pest.|When do I get my reward?
{46949}{46998}When you die, you'll go to heaven.
{47068}{47148}I could do us all a favour|and fill it with rat poison.
{47151}{47210}Where are the damn things?
{47361}{47409}I'll be.
{47762}{47851}What are you doing?|I'm trying to get some work done.
{47854}{47883}Ella.
{47983}{48022}What are you doing?
{48041}{48096}Come on.
{48195}{48295}- {y:i}(♪ soft jazz)|- Put the lights on, give me my stick.
{48400}{48449}I can hardly see you.
{48478}{48583}Come on. Get out of the way.|What do you want?
{48698}{48800}I'm gonna do it, darlin'.|I'm gonna go back to school.
{48837}{48953}Put my mind to it,|I oughta be able to tear up the track.
{48957}{49030}What? Don't you|want to go to school with me?
{49187}{49242}Ah, I know.
{49245}{49334}Ow! Hey. You don't like the beard?
{49388}{49479}Neither do I. It's out of here, OK?
{49501}{49582}The beard is history. That a deal? What?
{49643}{49707}I know. I love you too.
{49892}{49969}No. This is one thing|you don't know how to do.
{49972}{50044}- She just wants to play.|- You spoil her, Allan.
{50047}{50116}I want to spoil her. She's really...
{50155}{50227}- made my life...|- I know.
{50230}{50308}No. I don't think you do know, Melanie.
{50338}{50414}- I don't think you can know.|- Hold still.
{50445}{50559}She does so much for me. She seems|to want to do things just for me.
{50602}{50644}Look.
{50694}{50749}Completely different guy.
{50927}{51011}You're not gonna stop|coming around now, are you?
{51014}{51102}I mean, now that Ella's|finished her basic training.
{51106}{51153}I hate to see you disappear.
{51179}{51255}I won't disappear. I'll be around.
{51284}{51355}God, I'm sorry. I must have cut you.
{51358}{51474}- It's nothing.|- Hey! Get away from there.
{51532}{51576}Don't worry.
{51787}{51862}- Allan, hi!|- How are you guys doing?
{51865}{51894}Great.
{51925}{52037}- Who's your friend?|- This is Ella. That's my girl.
{52040}{52085}Ella's your girl?
{52286}{52452}June 12, 1984 - the Supreme Court|reversed the sixth circuit court of appeal
{52455}{52559}in a case involving the City of Memphis.
{52582}{52626}What was the ruling?
{52741}{52790}{y:i}(laughter)
{52824}{52889}Check it out.
{52993}{53085}Well, Mr Mann,|does your friend know the answer?
{53088}{53137}Or do you?
{53140}{53289}The ruling held that courts could|not upset valid seniority systems
{53292}{53353}to protect the rights of minority workers.
{53356}{53411}{y:i}(applause)
{53684}{53730}Got one? Reel it in!
{53820}{53942}- Shit. My fault.|- No. It just wasn't meant to be.
{53972}{54048}At least we got one on the line.
{54070}{54170}It's not the right time of year.|We'll come back when they're running.
{54173}{54239}- Promise?|- Yeah, I promise.
{54269}{54340}- That was easy.|- It was, wasn't it?
{54467}{54529}- You getting cold?|- A little.
{54532}{54589}Let's pack it in.
{54850}{54934}- It's pretty fancy.|- Yeah. Each card dials a number.
{54937}{55062}Ella does it for me. She already|knows which cards are which.
{55065}{55133}- You're shitting me?|- The ones I use most often.
{55138}{55237}Telephone, Ella.|Come on, Ella. Telephone.
{55240}{55286}Telephone Geoffrey.
{55360}{55404}Geoffrey, Ella.
{55666}{55785}- Christ. You don't think?|- I do think.
{55788}{55869}She knows you're here|so it makes no sense to call you.
{55917}{55998}- No, no. There's no way, man.|- Go outside a minute.
{56001}{56095}- There's no way...|- Don't tell me you're not curious. Go on.
{56232}{56334}OK, Ella. He's gone. Telephone Geoffrey.
{56337}{56390}Come on. Telephone Geoffrey.
{56525}{56611}Come on back in! She did it.
{56614}{56726}She's unbelievable.|She's like a miniature person.
{56729}{56823}{y:i}Hi, this is Geoffrey. I can't come|{y:i}to the phone, but leave a message.
{56826}{56902}After all that,|she gets an answering machine.
{56905}{56943}{y:i}Hello?
{56988}{57055}Who's that? Is that you, Burbage?
{57099}{57160}What the hell are you doing in my lab?
{57373}{57476}- What's all that about?|- It's nothing.
{57480}{57541}What's the matter?
{57544}{57647}Same old shit.|Boss messing with my work. I hate it.
{57673}{57765}- Do you mind if I help myself to a beer?|- No. Go ahead.
{57818}{57917}Ella, you wanna go grab a beer with me?|Come on.
{57970}{58039}Burbage is a schmuck, eh?
{58136}{58230}You really are getting smart, aren't you?
{58234}{58349}You must like it here. Maybe this brew|of mine is finally doing its stuff.
{58352}{58395}{y:i}(shrieking)
{58444}{58543}- What happened?|- Nothing. She cut her hand. She's fine.
{58569}{58647}Ella, come on. Sshh... Ella.
{58678}{58721}What's going on in there?
{58829}{58868}No.
{58960}{59017}Geoffrey! What are you doing to her?
{59064}{59113}- Ella...|- Geoffrey!
{59153}{59204}- Geoffrey!|- Ella, come on.
{59764}{59813}{y:i}(water flushes)
{59844}{59930}- How did you get into my laboratory?|- Your laboratory?
{59933}{59993}With those triple locks?
{59997}{60101}I know paranoia runs high|around the wing, but...
{60124}{60212}- Christ.|- One conditions -
{60216}{60287}by the carrot or by the stick.
{60291}{60416}I prefer the stick. It's closer|to what we encounter in real life.
{60442}{60518}Fear of drowning, for example,
{60521}{60626}concentrates the rodent mind wonderfully.
{60629}{60746}- You really are a sadist.|- No. A realist. Please don't smoke in here.
{60766}{60848}Let's cut the bullshit.|I just stopped by to tell you...
{60852}{60973}I was taking inventory and I discovered|that one of your monkeys died
{60976}{61036}several weeks back.
{61039}{61092}Not the one you've been injecting?
{61096}{61203}It was one of the others. Ten weeks|back and I still don't have a replacement.
{61206}{61340}And you're not going to get one until you|file a written report on your experiments.
{61343}{61381}You really kill me.
{61384}{61450}You continually ridicule my work,
{61453}{61540}but you're just dying to find out|if I'm on to something.
{61543}{61622}I should have gotten that monkey -|the one that died.
{61625}{61706}For autopsy, I know. I sent it down.
{61709}{61768}It never got here. How did you send it?
{61797}{61871}A student.|I don't have time for this bullshit.
{61875}{61943}You go slice up somebody's testicles.
{61946}{62089}You can throw away the keys to my|laboratory - I've had the locks changed.
{62092}{62133}All three of them.
{62467}{62543}Jesus!|Will you take it easy with that thing?
{62546}{62601}If you're gonna do a job, do it right.
{62604}{62711}I'm sick and tired of your insults.|I don't know what's gotten into you.
{62714}{62817}- I work my butt off around here.|- Bullshit! This place is a pigsty!
{62820}{62898}You don't change Ella's cage|or fill her food dishes.
{62901}{62989}This is our house. You have been hired|to perform certain functions.
{62992}{63060}When you don't perform them,|we get pissed off.
{63063}{63128}And just who is this "we"?
{63131}{63202}- Me and Ella.|- That's what I thought you meant.
{63205}{63296}It's unnatural - you and that monkey.
{63299}{63412}She is just a dirty,|filthy, sneaky, little beast.
{63438}{63554}You don't like the way this place looks?|She's the one that leaves it a mess.
{63557}{63673}Maryanne. Maryanne, come back here!|Maryanne!

{64831}{64880}God give me strength.
{65121}{65183}Get rid of that bird, Maryanne.

{71037}{71074}Um... Eleven.
{71144}{71286}Allan! Darling! Nobody answered.|I thought something was wrong.
{71348}{71437}Mother, I... I wasn't expecting...
{71440}{71526}I know. I know. I should have phoned.
{71529}{71658}But I knew that you would|just tell me not to come and...
{71661}{71753}What's the difference?|I'm here. We're together.
{71934}{72027}- I'll do that, if you want.|- Not a chance. It's my pleasure.
{72031}{72101}I'll make Grandmother's potatoes.|Would you like that?
{72104}{72221}- He's selfish and ungrateful.|- Please try and find Ella. I'm worried.
{72225}{72361}I left the door open when I came in.|I hope she didn't get out.
{72364}{72503}- She's just hiding. Probably in the attic.|- Cos you're after her all the time.
{72506}{72593}You killed my Bogie!
{72629}{72678}Maryanne, you're confused.
{72681}{72770}Not with his hands.|He had his little demon do it for him.
{72774}{72920}- Ella was in her cage.|- I don't know how you did it, but you did!
{72923}{73040}The two of you together.|And now my little Bogie is gone!
{73060}{73177}Maybe it was old age, huh?|Maybe it was a rat that got it.
{73199}{73320}Maybe you crushed it when you jammed|your foot in the slipper. Who gives a shit?
{73340}{73395}It deserved to die.
{73398}{73474}It fucking deserved to die.
{73602}{73626}Allan?
{73721}{73760}Oh.
{73993}{74058}This is embarrassing.|I'd rather Maryanne do this.
{74061}{74172}What's the matter?|I've never seen you naked? Come on.
{74198}{74262}Anyway, you're stuck with me.
{74288}{74361}- Maryanne's leaving.|- Maryanne's leaving?
{74364}{74435}- Uh-huh.|- You mean while you're here?
{74438}{74577}No, she's quitting. She called me last|week and said she was looking for work.
{74581}{74630}Last week?
{74776}{74851}- Bitch.|- Allan, it's all right.
{74854}{74919}Actually, her timing couldn't be better.
{74923}{75007}Her decision helped me|reach a decision of my own -
{75010}{75076}one that I've been procrastinating about...
{75079}{75120}What is it?
{75123}{75182}Well... I hope you approve.
{75185}{75316}I've sold my business.|I'm selling the house in Lake Forest.
{75319}{75374}You're planning on moving in?
{75399}{75529}It's the only solution, Allan.|Don't worry. I'll stay out of your way.
{75533}{75614}I know you're a very private person.
{75640}{75797}At the same time, I'll be able to help.|I'll be here when you need me.
{75875}{75951}Mother... Mother, my hand moved.
{75977}{76025}- Did you see it?|- Allan, please...
{76028}{76091}Did you see my fucking hand move|or didn't you?!
{76095}{76232}No, I did not. There is nothing to see.|Your hand did not move. It cannot move.
{76257}{76343}I don't like the way you're behaving.|I don't like it at all.
{77001}{77042}{y:i}(horn)
{77115}{77197}{y:i}(intercom) Allan, what is it?|{y:i}Want anything?
{77200}{77322}Uh... No. No, Mother. I'm all right.
{77325}{77460}- {y:i}Do you have to go to the bathroom?|- No, I'm all right. Just leave me alone.
{77522}{77589}Just leave me alone.
{77867}{77982}You can get out of this cage, can't you?|You can get out of this house.
{79110}{79203}Ella... you little devil, you.
{79286}{79383}Nothing. There's no way|she could be getting out.
{79386}{79448}She's coming in wet, covered with mud.
{79452}{79528}Allan, look at me. The attic is a mess.
{79531}{79598}Leaks in the roof.|It's been raining in there.
{79601}{79707}Ella is getting out of the house.|If it's not the attic, it's some other way.
{79711}{79774}And I'm getting out with her.
{79777}{79916}These dreams I've been having... They're|not dreams. It's more like experiences.
{79918}{79982}It's like I'm in Ella's body.
{79985}{80077}Running with her strength.|Seeing through her eyes.
{80106}{80224}- I'm part of her. She's part of me.|- You do know that that's impossible.
{80227}{80328}No, I don't know.|It is not impossible. It's happening.
{80331}{80390}You're talking about telepathy, Ace.
{80394}{80466}Some sort of mind meld. Come on.
{80469}{80607}I know there's a strong bond between you|and Ella, but... paranormal contact?
{80610}{80671}It's impossible. It just can't be.
{80674}{80784}Allan, are you all right?|Do I need to start worrying about you?
{80787}{80901}No, I'm fine.|Just an overactive imagination, I guess.
{81135}{81234}My hand moved - I saw it move -|but Wiseman says that's impossible.
{81237}{81334}You should always get a second opinion|with something serious.
{81337}{81404}Even with the brilliant John Wiseman.
{81407}{81498}- Do I detect a note of sarcasm?|- Wiseman's overconfident.
{81501}{81615}- Sometimes he... misses things.|- He missed something with Allan?
{81618}{81728}I don't know, but it looks to me|like you've got a congenital problem.
{81731}{81794}This injury here|was caused by the accident -
{81797}{81893}it's what Wiseman repaired|and it looks like a competent job.
{81896}{82014}But I don't think this is what's|causing your paralysis. See this?
{82017}{82109}This abnormality doesn't look|like it was caused by trauma.
{82112}{82181}If this is the culprit...
{82184}{82329}then your paralysis could have come on|crossing the street, lying in bed.
{82332}{82399}The accident could have been|a tragic coincidence.
{82402}{82429}Tragic?
{82432}{82525}Without the accident,|the docs might have looked harder.
{82528}{82633}They probably figured you got hit|by a truck, spinal damage, case closed.
{82636}{82785}So if they... he had looked harder|and he found what you found...
{82818}{82892}- Could he have fixed it?|- Can you fix it?
{82895}{82963}This is a very inexact specialty.
{82966}{83043}Let me run some more tests|before you ask me that question.
{83164}{83261}{y:i}- (growling)|{y:i}- (thinks) Wiseman. That motherfucker.
{83296}{83394}That self-satisfied son of a bitch.
{83398}{83440}If he did this to me...
{83457}{83565}If he put me through this for no fucking|reason other than his own incompetence.
{83569}{83693}- Allan. Don't waste your time on anger.|- That son of a bitch.
{83723}{83778}Ego-fucking-maniac. I could...
{83781}{83883}I don't understand this reaction.|You're letting bad news overshadow good.
{83887}{83973}There's hope - not false hope, real hope.
{83976}{84059}Just when things|might turn your way, you...
{84145}{84211}I don't like this change in you, Allan.
{85119}{85175}- {y:i}Dr Wiseman's office.|- Is he there?
{85178}{85276}{y:i}We don't expect him back until Monday.|{y:i}He's taken a few days off.
{85280}{85330}I have to talk to him.
{85333}{85436}- {y:i}Well, if it's an emergency...|- It is an emergency.
{85439}{85514}{y:i}OK. He left a number|{y:i}where he can be reached.
{85517}{85599}{y:i}Let me see... It's JL-5...
{85602}{85670}9-7-2-9.
{85673}{85803}- {y:i}You already have that number?|- Yes. I have that number.
{86298}{86347}{y:i}(rings)
{86416}{86456}Hello?
{86498}{86538}Hello?
{86617}{86661}Hello?
{86664}{86713}{y:i}(hangs up)
{86789}{86850}- Hung up.|- Oh.
{86890}{86943}Hate it when that happens.
{86994}{87043}It always scares me.
{88902}{88951}{y:i}(sighing)
{89429}{89517}Oh, my God. Both of them?
{89543}{89646}You mean they were together?|Oh, my God!
{89649}{89711}What am I gonna tell Allan?
{89714}{89850}Oh. Allan just came in.|Yes, I will. Thank you for calling.
{89853}{89927}Allan, something terrible has happened.
{89930}{89979}- There was...|- A fire.
{90292}{90398}- Take her away.|- Ace, Ella could not have done this.
{90401}{90521}I think she did do it. I think she did it|for me. Because I wanted it done.
{90524}{90620}You wanted them to die in a fit of anger.|That's a normal reaction.
{90623}{90672}These people fucked you over.
{90675}{90788}Now this thing happens - it's coincidence -|and you're blaming it on yourself.
{90791}{90899}It wasn't a fit of anger.|I thought about it - of ways of doing it.
{90903}{91041}Fire was one of those ways. I knew that|old cabin. I knew that it would burn fast.
{91045}{91102}Allan...
{91216}{91320}- Did you do that or did she?|- She did it. She acts on her own as well.
{91340}{91452}That worries me too. What she might do|when she's been exposed to...
{91455}{91536}- Exposed to what?|- Geoff...
{91539}{91597}I've been so full of anger.
{91646}{91713}I've had the most horrible thoughts lately.
{91739}{91832}It's like vomiting up|every resentment I ever had.
{91835}{91924}Every ugly, vicious, sinful...
{91957}{92020}That's what it is - it's sin.
{92046}{92106}It's the desire to sin, Geoff.
{92155}{92267}- If Ella's plugged into that...|- You did not cause that fire, nor did Ella.
{92271}{92392}Animals are instinctively terrified of fire.|They won't go near a naked flame.
{92612}{92715}Was that an instinctive reaction?|Or does she just know what fire can do?
{92718}{92771}Christ. All right...
{92815}{92954}I'll take her down to the lab|and run whatever tests I can run on her.
{92957}{93054}Though I don't expect to find sin|in a urine sample.
{93080}{93129}{y:i}(whimpers)
{93304}{93367}- Sorry, Melanie.|- That's...
{93483}{93587}- Don't bring her back.|- I'll check with you on Monday.
{94201}{94330}Why don't you stay here tonight?|You could stay for the weekend.
{94357}{94410}Different environment. Fresh air.
{94414}{94527}How could you handle it?|Just getting me in and out of bed...
{94530}{94636}I've got the practice room in the barn.|Got all the equipment.
{94639}{94739}I think it'll be warm enough.|Got plenty of blankets.
{94757}{94880}We'll try to forget it. For two days,|we will try to forget everything.
{94883}{94956}- Deal?|- I'll try.
{94988}{95058}I really will try. I just...
{96012}{96073}I can feel myself coming back to normal.
{96102}{96170}Every minute,|that rage just gets lifted away.
{96174}{96310}Every minute you're with me|or every minute you're away from Ella?
{96313}{96352}Both.
{96457}{96512}Bedtime?
{96915}{96959}I'm sorry.
{99440}{99500}{y:i}(agitated chattering)
{100015}{100079}I could enrol you in the college, Ella.
{100120}{100189}These other idiots|are still pissing on their feet.
{100205}{100336}They're all getting the same dosage.|The missing ingredient must be Allan.
{101175}{101233}My God. You want it?
{101738}{101795}What? No complaint?
{101851}{101915}I've turned you into a fucking junkie.
{102024}{102144}What else have I turned you into? Has this|stuff plugged you into Allan somehow?
{102387}{102442}Seven bottles of beer on the wall.
{102514}{102668}You didn't do it, did you, Ella? All that|stuff that Allan's been blaming on you?
{102672}{102758}I know that you've been getting|out of the house...
{102784}{102854}but you couldn't have committed murder.
{103000}{103068}I don't know. I just can't be sure.
{103071}{103189}You weren't trying to make|your hand move. It moved by itself.
{103219}{103288}Spinal surgery is risky business.
{103291}{103425}Without some proof, some more positive|sign, I can't recommend taking that risk.
{103429}{103504}- What kind of sign?|- A voluntary movement.
{103507}{103558}A movement you make deliberately -
{103561}{103637}even if it's only a finger or a toe.
{103640}{103729}Show me that you can do that|and I'll say, "Let's operate."
{104073}{104120}- Hello, Mother.|- Where have you been?
{104123}{104198}- At school.|- Where have you been all weekend?
{104201}{104265}I tried to call you at least a dozen times.
{104268}{104332}We decided not to answer the phone.
{104335}{104417}Mel, don't come in.|I just don't want any bullshit.
{104420}{104484}- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.|- Mel, don't.
{104487}{104546}I don't want any bullshit either.
{104596}{104662}Hi, Mrs Mann. How are you today?
{105316}{105352}Burbage.
{105474}{105523}Jesus. He's got it.
{105551}{105600}He's got the serum.
{105767}{105816}Motherfucker!
{106022}{106085}Burbage won't learn anything.
{106088}{106156}Not from you, you simple bastards.
{106159}{106215}He won't learn diddly shit.
{106269}{106300}Maybe...
{106324}{106377}Maybe I still can from you, sugar.
{106430}{106483}One bottle of beer on the wall.
{106516}{106646}One last dose. Not for you this time.|This time, it's for me.
{106650}{106729}If this shit can plug you into Allan's head,
{106732}{106796}maybe it can plug me into yours.
{107014}{107067}{y:i}(bell rings)
{107070}{107119}All right, Ella.
{107156}{107281}Come on. Let's tune in.|Let's make contact, Ella.
{107284}{107356}- {y:i}(growling)|- It's only you and me now.
{107360}{107452}Let me know what's on your mind.|Come on, Ella. Show me.
{107455}{107519}Show me what you can do.
{107686}{107768}- You didn't hear from Geoffrey?|- Why would I?
{107772}{107909}- He... He has Ella.|- He can keep her for all I care.
{107912}{108017}I told him to keep her, Mother. I told him|not to bring her back. She's gone.
{108021}{108085}She did something to that girl, didn't she?
{108088}{108209}She did something to that Melanie|and she asked you to get rid of her.
{108212}{108300}You'd do anything she asks in a minute.
{108303}{108393}Mother, let's try and bury the hatchet.
{108396}{108522}Look, I know I haven't been|very pleasant to be around lately.
{108553}{108645}I'm gonna try and fix that.|Do you think you could do the same?
{108649}{108732}What am I supposed to fix, Allan?|What have I done?
{108735}{108798}What have I ever done|except worry about you?
{108875}{108924}{y:i}(thunder)
{109481}{109529}{y:i}(snarling)
{110299}{110373}Mother, this business about Melanie.
{110417}{110497}I need your support, not discouragement.
{110548}{110649}However things turn out medically,|with or without the use of my body,
{110653}{110723}I'm gonna try to make it work between us.
{110749}{110825}- Whatever you want is fine with me.|- Oh, bullshit!
{110829}{110917}You're so fucked up, you can't even!
{111023}{111073}Mother, she's here.
{111076}{111138}Ella's here. She's in the house.
{111142}{111259}I think you've got a serious problem.|I think you're going crazy on me.
{111262}{111363}She's here. I can feel her.|Filling me up with...
{111367}{111440}- For God's sakes...|- There's danger.
{111471}{111570}The way I've been acting, these rages -|Ella pulls them out of me.
{111573}{111627}She pulls them to the surface.
{111630}{111730}What is this? Is this some sort of game|that you're playing?
{111734}{111815}If you can't stand having me here,|just tell me, I'll go.
{111818}{111918}- You don't have to put me through this.|- Mother, please stop.
{111921}{112042}Please don't make me angry.|I can't control it. It's Ella. She...
{112045}{112102}{y:i}(phone rings)
{112156}{112238}If that's Melanie,|tell her the monkey's here.
{112240}{112319}Tell her to come here right away.
{112384}{112472}- Hello?|- {y:i}Hi, Mrs Mann. It's Melanie Parker.
{112475}{112545}- {y:i}Can Allan come to the phone?|- No. He's in the bath.
{112548}{112618}{y:i}OK. Would you ask him|{y:i}to call me when he gets out?
{112621}{112707}He's going to bed.|Call him tomorrow in the daytime.
{112951}{113062}Mother, I'm sorry.|I shouldn't have shouted at you. I'm afraid.
{113065}{113136}I'm afraid for you, Mother.
{113139}{113237}If you ever tried to understand anything,|try to understand this.
{113240}{113308}I understand. I understand the truth.
{113311}{113404}You've made it plain.|I just was never willing to accept it.
{113407}{113434}Mother...
{113437}{113546}Do you have any idea|how much you've made me cry?
{113549}{113673}Do you have any idea how worthless|you've made me feel? How alone?
{113737}{113852}- I've given up everything for you!|- Who asked you to give up anything?
{113855}{113944}You don't give a shit|about me or anybody else.
{113947}{114006}You're too wrapped up in yourself.
{114009}{114134}Your life is nothing|but an empty, greedy, black hole
{114137}{114240}and you've been trying to suck me into it|for as long as I can remember.
{114243}{114316}Well, I cannot stand it any more.
{114319}{114381}I cannot stand your bullshit.
{114384}{114482}You're a conniving,|clinging, bloodsucking bitch.
{114583}{114623}Mother...
{114812}{114867}You deserve whatever you get.
{114906}{114948}I hate you.
{114965}{115014}I hate you.

{119077}{119130}Geoff, she's here. Ella's here.
{119615}{119681}- What's with the lights?|- Check the breakers.
{119684}{119728}Something happened to Mother.
{119865}{119917}- What the hell?|- Geoff?
{120185}{120267}- Geoff, what is it?|- I don't know.
{120271}{120362}- Must be a short somewhere. You OK?|- Mother. Upstairs.
{120365}{120414}I'll be right back.
{120468}{120525}- Ella's not in here, is she?|- No.
{120595}{120644}I don't think so.
{121753}{121802}Oh, God.
{122303}{122419}It's me... I killed them.
{122482}{122582}- All of them.|- You couldn't kill anyone, Allan.
{122585}{122746}No. I got 5,000 years|of civilised behaviour bred into me.
{122789}{122847}But what if I wasn't civilised any more?
{122877}{123002}What if I was an animal?|Free to follow my instincts.
{123044}{123136}That's what the devil is, Geoff. It's instinct.
{123168}{123217}Animal instinct.
{123269}{123318}Lives in us all.
{123362}{123425}Lives by its own set of laws.
{123477}{123549}Laws of the jungle.
{123552}{123636}You didn't do any of this, Allan. I did.
{123659}{123764}Ella has been genetically altered.|I've had her on a new drug.
{123767}{123869}- Don't tell me this...|- I lost track, Allan.
{123873}{123983}- I lost track of everything but my work.|- Geoff, don't tell me this.
{123986}{124125}You said she was normal -|even after I told you what was happening.
{124129}{124245}I was just part of some experiment,|wasn't I? A guinea pig, this whole time.
{124248}{124322}No. At the beginning|I was really trying to help.
{124325}{124492}What kind of experiment was it? What did|you do to Ella? What did you do to me?
{124495}{124530}Allan...
{126721}{126792}- You see her?|- She didn't come back here.
{126795}{126886}- The attic.|- Maybe we should wait or get help.
{126889}{126951}- I can handle her.|- We should get help.
