Sometimes he... misses things.

You think he missed
something with Allan?

610
00:56:55,581 --> 00:57:00,085
I don't know, but it looks to me
like you've got a congenital problem.

611
00:57:00,294 --> 00:57:02,838
This injury here, this
was caused by the accident,

612
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:06,967
it's what Wiseman repaired surgically
and it looks like a competent job.

613
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:11,972
But I don't think this is what's
causing your paralysis. See this?

614
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,934
This is an abnormality that doesn't
look like it was caused by trauma.

615
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:18,937
If this is the culprit...

616
00:57:19,146 --> 00:57:25,110
then your paralysis could have come on
crossing the street, lying in bed.

617
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:28,030
The accident could have been
just a tragic coincidence.

618
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:29,323
Tragic?

619
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:32,826
Well, without the accident,
the docs might have looked a little harder.

620
00:57:33,035 --> 00:57:37,873
As it is, they probably figured you got hit
by a truck, spinal damage, case closed.

621
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:44,171
So if they, or he had looked harder
and he found what you found...

622
00:57:45,547 --> 00:57:48,592
- Could he have fixed it?
- Can you fix it?
