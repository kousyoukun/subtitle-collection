00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,210
You actually lied for me.
I lied for me.

2
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,090
No, come on. You lied for both of us.

3
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,090
You actually did something decent for me.
That's a part of history you can't change.

4
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,090
That was a stop sign.

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,510
You're kidding, right?

6
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,440
In your car, I'd be kidding?

7
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,780
On this road?
I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.

8
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,360
Come on, Darry.

9
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,980
"Gay Fever!"

10
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,510
No, "Gay Forever."

11
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,630
"Gay Forever." That's mine.

12
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,670
That's 3 for little bro'.

13
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,670
That's a 6, not a G, you idiot.

14
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,940
That's "Sexy Forever." That's mine.

15
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,900
That's 5 to 2.
Shit.

16
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,860
"Gay Fever?"

17
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,550
Sexy forever, huh?

18
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,780
You know that is you in 40 years.

19
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,210
There's usually a reason
when you like the long way home.

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,090
Gee, like, maybe I like the country?

21
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,940
Okay.

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,240
Just drive, brat.

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,670
I'm only thinking the same thing
Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking.

24
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,480
"Trisha, why are you driving home
for spring break with your brat brother...

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,860
"...and not heading off somewhere with
that nice 'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?"

26
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,170
I will tell them the same
thing I'll tell you:

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,130
None of your goddamn business.

28
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,170
What?

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,940
You don't think I could understand
the complex nature of your relationships?

30
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,440
No, I look at you as a real expert.

31
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,740
Whatever. I don't care.

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,090
I'm just saying,
if you broke it off with him...

33
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,440
...you should at least figure out
what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad.

34
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,710
They're the ones in love with the guy.

35
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,630
What would Jesus do...

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,740
I am no fanatic. What I am is a fan of Godl

37
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,510
...a serpent-headed demon,
shaking you by the...

38
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,740
You wanted the back way home.

39
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,900
That's 10 hours of preachers, farm reports...

40
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,280
Could you possibly just shut up
and drive, please?

41
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,360
"You broke my heart in 2

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,780
"Now I can't find the duct tape

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,090
"To put it together for you

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,820
Come on, girl, sing along now.

45
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,780
"When I met you, I thought I would die

46
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,400
"I wanted to cry

47
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,900
"Didn't know you were evil

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
"or that you would hurt me

49
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,400
"Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team guy

50
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,860
"Turns out you're a twit and a real-"

51
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,780
Jesus!

52
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
What the hell is his problem?
Just get out of his way, Darry!

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,630
Let him pass you, Darry!
What are you doing?

54
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,050
Go around me!

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,010
Get off the road and let him pass you!

56
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,820
He's nuts!
I know he's nuts. Pull over!

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,740
Go around me!

58
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,820
Slow down and let him fucking pass you!
I'm trying!

59
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,980
Jesus!

60
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,210
Shit!

61
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,590
What the hell was his problem?

62
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,090
My first guess? Inbreeding!

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,860
Get a load of that nasty old thing.

64
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,280
What is that, the vehicle of choice
for assholes and fucking serial killers?

65
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,710
God.

66
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,550
You know what I just thought of, right?

67
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,090
Kenny and Darla?

68
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,480
They died about a 100 miles from here.

69
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,630
The same highway.
This highway runs the length of the state.

70
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,010
You believe it?

71
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,860
That they had to go looking for her head?

72
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,900
That they never found them, only the car.

73
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,130
No, they never found her head.
They found the car.

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,980
Didn't find him or her head.

75
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,780
Look at me, I'm still shaking!

76
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,590
You don't think every generation
has their cautionary tale...

77
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,630
...of drinking and driving on Prom night?

78
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,240
I always heard it was true.
Wheaton Valley High, class of '78.

79
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,090
You wanna know something?

80
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,280
When I first heard that story...

81
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,980
...I used to think this was the highway
I would die on.

82
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,550
Quite the cheery thinker today,
aren't we, sis?

83
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,170
What's "Poli-Sci Guy"
been doing to you, anyway?

84
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,360
"Beating you?"

85
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,480
That was the license plate
on the van we just saw.

86
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,240
BE-A-T-N-G-U.

87
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,240
So "Beating You."

88
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,400
That's mine. That's 3 to 5.

89
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,240
You can't call it now.
My ass!

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,780
You have to call it when you see it.
I was in shock!

91
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,240
Tough!
What is this, a brand new rule?

92
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,480
It's always been this way.

93
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,090
Since when?
Since always.

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,010
Since just now, maybe.

95
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,590
Your memory's for shit.
No, it's not.

96
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,400
Nah, infinity.

97
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
Uh-huh, infinity squared.

98
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,010
Okay, name it.
What?

99
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,550
When we made the rule that you had to
call it as soon as you see it.

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,630
Would you give it up already?

101
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,240
That's 'cause the rule has always been...

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,860
...the first person who calls it, gets it.

103
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,320
You talk to Mom lately?

104
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,740
To tell her I'd be home for break.

105
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,590
She sound weird?

106
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,210
What?

107
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,400
Did you listen to her voice?

108
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,550
Could you specify, please?

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
Forget it.

110
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,550
Did you drink the last water?

111
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,670
The last one was mine.

112
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,510
You are a class act, you know that?

113
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,170
You live off-campus.

114
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,710
You ever try and do laundry in a dorm?

115
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,210
What they don't steal, they dye pink.

116
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,860
I've got 12 pairs of rosy-pink jockey shorts.

117
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,480
Maybe they know something about you,
you don't.

118
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,740
"Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever.
Here's my dirty shorts."

119
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,590
It's for her, not me.

120
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,480
What? I have to bring home laundry.
If I don't, she gets depressed.

121
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,590
She thinks I don't need her anymore
or something.

122
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,170
I'm serious.

123
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,590
Goof.
Bitch.

124
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,480
Mama's boy.
Daddy's whore.

125
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,550
Dick licker.
Ball sniffer.

126
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,710
Ass kisser.
Butt picker.

127
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,280
Repeat. "Ass" and "butt." You lose.

128
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,170
I think maybe something's wrong.
You always think something's wrong.

129
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,940
Like you would notice anything past the
point of your own selfish little existence.

130
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,280
She's not happy.

131
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,820
Not like she used to be.
Who is?

132
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,510
Mom's not...

133
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,980
It's "Beating You."

134
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,440
What's he doing?

135
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,480
What the hell is that?

136
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,900
What the hell was he doing?

137
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,590
He dumped something down that pipe.

138
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,320
Wrapped in a sheet.

139
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,900
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.

140
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,940
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it.

141
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,510
Just get us out of here.

142
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,170
Grab my cell phone.
Where?

143
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,780
It's in the gym bag.

144
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,050
Oh, Jesus...

145
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,670
You gotta be kidding me.

146
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,670
The point of having a portable phone
is that it works when you need it!

147
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,900
I have a power cable for it.

148
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,710
And I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.

149
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,400
Goddamn it, what did I say? My car!

150
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,050
We should've taken my car!

151
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,280
He's coming up right on our ass.

152
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,780
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped up or something.

153
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,510
Darry...

154
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,400
He's coming up right on our ass.
What the fuck is in that thing?

155
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,440
You're out of your fucking mind!

156
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,710
What the hell's your problem?

157
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,130
Fuck me! Go!

158
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,090
What the hell's the matter with you!

159
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,710
Darry, what are you doing?
Hang on.

160
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,240
Just don't kill us, okay?

161
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,980
Sounds all right.

162
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,900
What?

163
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,170
Like either one of us would know.

164
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,820
I know a little.

165
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,670
Your car makes a strange noise...

166
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,780
...you just get a new tape, Darry.
You told me.

167
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,210
I told you?

168
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,590
I learned it from you.

169
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,280
Jesus Christ...

170
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,090
Whoa, wait.

171
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,820
I'm thinking past the point of my own
selfish little existence now, okay?

172
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,980
We're both pretty damn sure what
we saw him dump down that pipe, right?

173
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,170
What if it's someone still alive?

174
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,550
What if it was?

175
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,090
Someone who needs help.

176
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,440
We can get help as fast
by getting to a phone.

177
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,480
You have any idea how far
to the nearest phone?

178
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,010
We were just attacked!

179
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,630
And you don't even wanna find out why?

180
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,900
We look in the pipe, that's it.

181
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,050
Is this your idea of a little adventure
or something?

182
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,240
'Cause this is why girls are smarter, okay?

183
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,510
We look in the pipe, if there's
nothing there, nothing we can do...

184
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,820
...we just drive on home and call the cops.

185
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,550
You know that's what we should do.

186
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,630
Bullshit, I do.
Bullshit, you don't!

187
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,400
Look me in the eye and tell me
you can just drive away.

188
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,360
Leave who's ever back there, back there.

189
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,550
Maybe find out later they'd still be alive
if you'd just gone back.

190
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,670
Don't make this about
the right thing to do.

191
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,130
You just wanna go back there see if there's
something nasty at the end of that pipe.

192
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,360
Okay.

193
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,710
And what if it was you back there?

194
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,900
I'm not getting out of this car.

195
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,820
You don't have to.
I'm not.

196
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,860
Jesus, it's a church.

197
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,780
What's with all the birds?

198
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm just gonna look.

199
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,550
Let's do this and do it fast.

200
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,860
Oh, my God.

201
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,550
Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
Doesn't smell like one either.

202
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,360
Come on, you can't see anything in there.

203
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,550
You can see light down there.

204
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,780
Get a flashlight.

205
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,550
Come on, get a flashlight.

206
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,590
Hello!

207
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,900
Anybody down there?

208
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,240
Hey! Anybody down there?

209
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,710
Hello!

210
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,280
Hurry up. Come on.

211
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,360
Hello!

212
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,780
There's someone there, I heard them.

213
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,400
Hello!

214
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,010
You're hearing things, Darry.

215
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,130
Darry, don't even think about it!

216
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,980
Darry!
I told you I heard someone.

217
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,170
You know the part in scary movies...

218
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,400
...where somebody does something
really stupid...

219
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,240
...and everybody hates them for it?

220
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,400
This is it.

221
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,480
Hello!
No, Darry!

222
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,280
Let me slide down.
God damn it!

223
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,710
Let me get a little way in.
You're not going.

224
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,050
I'm not. Just hold my feet.

225
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,550
The feet?

226
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,940
Anybody down there?

227
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,480
When was the last time
you washed these socks?

228
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,360
I see something.

229
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,400
Hello!
I am counting to 10.

230
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,590
Something's moving.

231
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,820
Then I am letting go
and going back to my car.

232
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,550
Quiet!

233
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,320
I just saw it again.

234
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,360
Something is definitely moving
down there.

235
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,090
Rats!

236
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,590
What?
Rats!

237
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,820
Rats!

238
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,480
Darry!

239
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,130
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!

240
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,210
Darry, say something!

241
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,050
Are you okay?

242
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,550
How are you gonna get out of there, Dar?

243
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,860
You suck.

244
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,440
God, I am so sorry.

245
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,050
I bet you are.

246
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,740
I am. I don't know what happened.

247
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,740
You were kicking and I couldn't hold on...

248
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,240
Not as sorry as I am.

249
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,400
There were rats coming at my face.

250
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,630
They were running at me too, Trish.

251
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,320
I feel really bad. Are you okay?

252
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,740
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.

253
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,900
Trisha Jenner,
coming through in the clutch.

254
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,010
Thank you.

255
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,400
You were the one who wanted to come
and have a little adventure.

256
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,740
Shut up.

257
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,980
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there?

258
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,590
Darry?

259
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,710
What?

260
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,860
Darry?

261
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,480
Say it isn't so.

262
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,590
Did I hear you talking?

263
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,940
Darry, who in the holy hell
are you talking to down there?

264
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,400
I found our body.

265
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,440
You what?
I found our...

266
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,670
What?

267
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,510
Darry?

268
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,590
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!

269
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,480
Darry, tell me what's going on!

270
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,670
What?

271
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,860
We gotta get out of here.

272
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
No, let's stay and feed the birds.

273
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,280
Get help.

274
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,440
Get help, Trish.

275
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,010
What are you looking at?

276
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,050
Get out to the road
and find somebody who can help.

277
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,010
How are you gonna get out of there?

278
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,740
This is some kind of basement, right,
for the church?

279
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,510
You don't think I'm going in there, do you?

280
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,980
Get out to the road,
flag down anyone you see...

281
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,510
...tell them to get the cops out here
right away.

282
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,780
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.

283
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,240
And Trish...

284
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,050
...if you see that old truck coming...

285
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,740
...you get back to this pipe,
you holler down as loud as you can.

286
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
You just had to say that, right?

287
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,510
God damn it, Darry!

288
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,090
You asshole!

289
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,240
Darry?

290
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,780
Would you please just say something?

291
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,940
Darry, you're scaring the shit out of me!

292
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,360
We have to stop.

293
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,710
Did you hear me?

294
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,740
Darry?

295
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,480
She did lose her head.

296
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,940
Darla lost her head just like they said.

297
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,090
And you know what he did, Trish?

298
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,710
You know what he did for her?

299
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,210
He sewed it back on.

300
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,240
He sewed it right back on.

301
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,740
You gonna make a phone call?

302
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,590
Throw some water on yourself.

303
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,280
You look like
you just crawled out of a sewer.

304
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,440
He's going back.

305
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,320
He's going back. Come on!

306
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,210
Excuse me.

307
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,240
Excuse me, we need help.

308
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,280
I need you to please call the police.

309
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,510
The police?

310
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,130
We need help now, please!

311
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,400
Just go tell them what you saw
so we can get out of here, okay?

312
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,170
Come on, brat!

313
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,360
I mean it. I need you to hold it together.

314
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,550
Look at me, Darry.

315
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,670
I'm so scared, Trish.

316
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,130
I am so scared.

317
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,400
I'm scared, too, all right?

318
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,510
He's gonna get back to that church...

319
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,670
...and he's gonna know that we were there.

320
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,400
Are you gonna get that?

321
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,900
Yeah, hello.
Have you seen the cats yet?

322
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,820
You and your brother.
Me and my brother?

323
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,710
You and Darry. I saw you with lots of cats.

324
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,320
Who the hell is this?
How do you know Darry?

325
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,630
Who is this?

326
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,320
Darry?
You know the cats I'm talking about?

327
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,480
Who is this?

328
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,170
You have a torn shirt, right?

329
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,820
And a bloody hand.

330
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,510
Shirt's torn just above
a small rose tattoo...

331
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,980
...on your stomach.

332
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,170
Who is this?

333
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,940
How the hell do you know us?

334
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,210
You found its house of pain.

335
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,820
The what?

336
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,940
Those bodies down there...

337
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,170
...that's what it likes to call it...

338
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,280
...its house of pain.

339
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,010
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

340
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,860
I don't know if it's a demon or a devil...

341
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,400
...or just some hungry thing...

342
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,590
...from some dark place in time.

343
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,980
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

344
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,550
I just know it's not gonna stop
coming after you...

345
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,440
...or anyone else it wants to.

346
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,170
Once it has the scent
of something it likes...

347
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,010
...it can't stop.

348
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,130
Is what...
What is she saying?

349
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,050
I saw that awful truck, too.

350
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,210
With the license plate.

351
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,820
"Beating You?"

352
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,170
The license plate on its truck.

353
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,550
Right, "Beating You"?

354
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,240
No, think about it.

355
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,130
Think about it, for Christ's sake.

356
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,280
Hold on. I need you to listen to this.

357
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,630
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?

358
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,400
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

359
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,510
Okay.

360
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,670
You hear that song, you run.

361
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,710
And I mean run.

362
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,820
'Cause that song means
something terrible for you.

363
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,090
Something so terrible
you couldn't dream of it...

364
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,980
...not in your worst,
most terrible nightmare.

365
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,820
Fuck you, lady!

366
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,630
Darry.

367
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,050
Darry?

368
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,630
Hello?

369
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,510
Let's talk with the cops
and get the hell out of here.

370
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,170
Maybe you should've left out the part
about that phone call.

371
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,090
It just sounds too much like a bad dream.

372
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,860
Everything I said I saw, I saw.

373
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,280
What, you think I bumped my head
down there or something?

374
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,550
I didn't say that.

375
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,590
You believe me, right?

376
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,170
Right?

377
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,240
Look me in the eye
and tell me you believe me.

378
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,940
Look me right in the eye right now,
you tell me you believe everything I said!

379
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,590
We're running the plates...

380
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,740
...and we've got some people
on their way out to the old church.

381
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,820
These kids you saw on that wall,
who were they again?

382
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,210
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...

383
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:03,980
...Brandon.

384
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,240
Found their car all smashed up
about 20 years ago.

385
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,670
Am I remembering this right?
Yeah.

386
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,630
Those bodies would be
nothing but bones by now.

387
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,320
You said they still had skin on them
and he had a ring on his finger.

388
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,860
What are you saying?

389
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,210
I told you, I grabbed one of them like this.

390
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,710
And it was hard, like petrified wood.

391
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,710
Like he preserved them or something.

392
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,510
He's got them all stitched together
like some kind of quilt.

393
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,980
I'm just trying to get all the facts here.
And I told you the facts!

394
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,210
This guy drives an old brown truck...

395
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,010
...and it nearly killed us.

396
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,860
We saw him throw a body down a pipe...

397
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,510
...that dumps into the cellar
of that old church.

398
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,590
This guy must have 500,
maybe 600 bodies down there...

399
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,090
...and I've seen them!

400
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,480
Stuck up on the walls...

401
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,360
...like some psycho version
of the Sistine Chapel!

402
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,360
What, you don't believe me?

403
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,440
Drive out to the old church
if you think I'm Iying.

404
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,130
No one's saying you're Iying.

405
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,980
Good, because I'm not Iying!

406
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,550
Look at this from my point of view.

407
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,210
This is a pretty big story
you're laying on us here.

408
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,050
That's your car out at the pumps, isn't it?

409
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,590
Bunch of folks saw him from the window.

410
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,170
The man there at your car.

411
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,740
He was standing there at your car...

412
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,480
...sniffin' that laundry...

413
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,670
...holding big handfuls of it under his nose.

414
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,280
Looked like he was liking it, too.

415
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,210
Which way he run off, Binky?

416
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,480
Still think I bumped my head?

417
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,320
He had time to get to the church,
then back here.

418
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,780
This guy is after us!

419
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,670
And he's after us
'cause he knows what we saw.

420
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,900
And now he even knows my name.

421
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,130
Central, this is 037. Come back.

422
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,240
You interested in a hand print?

423
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
037, go ahead, please.

424
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,590
037, this is Central.

425
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,400
Go ahead.

426
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,860
You can dust that, right? Get a print?

427
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,510
Looks like somebody already did.

428
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,480
037, what's going on out there?

429
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,010
037, I need a response, please.

430
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,590
There is definitely some
weird shit going on.

431
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,010
This is Central. 037, that is an affirmative.

432
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,980
We should all just get in the car and go.
We should go.

433
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,590
What is your situation?

434
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,940
037, please respond.

435
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,210
How'd he get to the church
and back to the diner so fast?

436
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,710
What the hell was he doing
with your clothes?

437
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,940
He drives fast, but not that fast.

438
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,210
Maybe he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

439
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,940
He'd have to be superhuman.
Otherwise, the smell would've killed him.

440
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,360
Please come back, 037, out there on East 9.

441
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,820
Central, this is 037. Go ahead.

442
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,710
You sure that's not a couple of
little pyromaniacs...

443
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,740
...you're escorting out there?

444
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,400
Go ahead.

445
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,480
This old church is on fire.

446
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,170
I'm talking burning out of control.

447
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,280
I'm up to my ass in Fire and Rescue,
but I can tell you...

448
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,740
...no one's going inside this thing
for a long time.

449
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,550
Incest capital of the world.

450
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,670
Don't be such a snot.

451
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,320
Don't tell me you actually like him.

452
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,820
Who?

453
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,090
Please.

454
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,710
I thought the waitress had dialed
the wrong number.

455
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,210
The guy looked like a strip-o-gram cop.

456
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,590
Like the missing link.

457
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,670
I wanna bring him to my Anthro class
for show and tell.

458
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,860
In sports, the national...

459
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,820
"Jeepers..."

460
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,130
That's the song!
What's the matter with you?

461
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,280
The words are the same.

462
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,980
"Creepshow,
where did you get those eyes..."

463
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,510
What is the matter with you?

464
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,240
That's the same song
that lady on the phone was playing!

465
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,710
These kids say the vehicle chased them
doing over 100, go ahead.

466
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,980
A preliminary came back on that dust
you took off the car handle.

467
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,400
It's dead skin.

468
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,210
Long dead. That's why it was powder.

469
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,980
Say what?

470
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,860
That's it! The words are the same, listen!

471
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,130
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those weepers."

472
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,050
Hold on, Central, the sky is falling.

473
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,280
She was playing this song to us,
and she said if we heard it...

474
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,480
This is it.

475
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,510
037, come in.

476
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,010
Are you okay in there?

477
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,320
037, this is Central. Come in.

478
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,860
Trish?

479
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,280
I said hello!

480
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,740
Get back in the car.

481
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,480
Central, this is 04...

482
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,900
Get back in the car, Trish!

483
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,550
What is that?

484
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,090
I'm not seeing this.

485
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,440
What is he doing?

486
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,480
Go.

487
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,010
I'm trying.
Go, go, go!

488
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,900
Go, go, go!
I'm trying!

489
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,400
Come on, you're gonna kill us!

490
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,740
I mean it, slow down!

491
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,710
Slow down!

492
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,440
No way.

493
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,740
There's a phone.
So?

494
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,590
So you just told me to stop.
I didn't say, "Stop." I said, "Slow down."

495
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,050
How far's the next town?
You mean the next phone?

496
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,670
It's pretty god damn far.
You wanna wait to find out?

497
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,280
Come on, Trish, look at this place.
Let's just keep going.

498
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,360
I mean it, come on.

499
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,980
You don't wanna get help?
Help from who?

500
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,630
We'll just use the phone.

501
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,280
And call who?
I don't know.

502
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,940
And tell them what?
I don't know.

503
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,670
"Hey, bum-fuck police,
I'm being chased by a guy...

504
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,440
"...who pulls tongues out of
severed heads with his teeth.

505
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,360
"Is there a special extension for that?"

506
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,780
Come on.

507
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:08,510
Christ, do you think
they even have a phone?

508
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,510
I'm guessing no phone and a lot of guns.

509
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,900
Who are you?

510
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,090
I said, "Who are you?"

511
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,010
Patricia Jenner. This is my brother Darry.

512
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,320
What do you want?
A telephone?

513
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,740
I don't have one.

514
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,550
I say we keep driving till we see people.

515
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,480
What do you think she is?

516
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,980
What you need a phone for if I had one?

517
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,400
I need to call the Pertwilla County Police.

518
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,210
Pertwilla?

519
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,670
That's one county back.
You're in Poho County.

520
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,740
Then Poho Police.
But I need to call someone.

521
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,050
Don't even think about
bringing the cops out here...

522
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,320
...with their zoning crap.

523
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,740
They try to tell me
how many cats people can have.

524
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:14,780
I'll have as many cats as I wanna have.

525
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,050
You can tell them that for me.

526
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,170
Please, someone's been killed.

527
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,010
Killed, you say?

528
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,210
Yeah, a policeman.

529
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,740
Holy Jesus, I thought...

530
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,710
I thought you meant one of my babies.

531
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,630
Did you hear what I just said?
Let's get out of here.

532
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,860
You can call the Sheriff's station,
just don't give them this address.

533
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,090
And tell them to go out on the
interstate where they ought to be.

534
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,710
My babies don't like strangers.

535
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,590
How many babies do you have?

536
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,050
More than a couple.

537
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,400
We've gotta get out of here right now.

538
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,090
Tell me this happens all the time.

539
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,440
Holy shit.

540
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,900
You kids got anyone else with you?

541
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,010
What?

542
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,860
That's not my scarecrow.

543
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,900
You got 10 seconds...

544
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,860
...to get your ass out of my yard!

545
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,010
And don't think I'm gonna tell you twice.

546
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,630
Get the hell away from him.
What are you doing, Trish?

547
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,130
Get the hell away from him!

548
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,090
Come on. Let's go.

549
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,130
No. Don't you go up there.

550
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,050
Listen to him!
We gotta get out of here!

551
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,780
What the hell did you bring into my house?

552
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,360
Get out of here.

553
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,780
Get away from my babies,
you sons of bitches!

554
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,400
I'll blow your fucking head off!

555
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,550
Hello?

556
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,400
Something's wrong.
Don't say that!

557
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,630
What do you want me to say?
The gears are sticking!

558
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,240
Unstick them, Trish!
You're gonna break it!

559
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,670
It's stuck in reverse!
Go in reverse!

560
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,780
What do we do?
Hit him.

561
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,510
Hit him, Trish.

562
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:19,980
Hard.

563
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,740
Do it!

564
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,480
What the hell is that thing?

565
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,240
What the hell are you doing?

566
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,900
Come on, you son of a bitch.

567
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,170
That's right,
walk that ugly face right over here.

568
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,900
Come on.

569
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,130
Come on!

570
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,170
Do you think he's dead?

571
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,480
They never are.

572
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,940
Enough.

573
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,670
Let's get out of here.

574
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,320
Trish.

575
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,940
I don't know how much further
this car is gonna go.

576
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,670
Not far enough.

577
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,550
Roach.

578
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,090
What are we boosting tonight?

579
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,170
Why don't you come over here
and find out, Big Daddy?

580
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,010
'76 Chevy Nova?

581
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,710
Anyone tell you, for a car thief,
you got taste for shit?

582
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,010
Would you tell Dad
to stop shouting, please?

583
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,480
Mom!

584
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,510
I understand that, Mother.

585
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,630
I'm just trying to tell you where we are.

586
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,780
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both okay.

587
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,740
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station
about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.

588
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,630
Because we'll be home
before you could get here.

589
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,440
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.

590
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,550
Mom, just let us get home, okay?

591
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,900
We don't wanna be out here
any more than you do.

592
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,400
Me, too.

593
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,820
I'll talk to you in a few hours.

594
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,940
Dad.

595
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,740
Thought I wrecked the car?

596
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,710
She's trailer trash.

597
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,400
Pig fucker.
Booger eater.

598
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,440
Trisha?

599
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,360
Trisha and Darry, right?

600
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,400
Jez, what are you doing here?

601
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,320
Excuse me, Jezelle?

602
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,820
Darry.

603
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,940
Darry Jenner.

604
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,980
Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
Come on. They've been through a lot.

605
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,280
Trisha.
Goddamn it, Jez.

606
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,480
I really need to talk to you,
if you could just spare me a minute.

607
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,130
Jezelle likes to think she's
the resident psychic here.

608
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,670
She helped us on a missing persons...

609
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,090
Could I just talk to these kids by myself?

610
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,740
You go home, turn off that police scanner,
and go to bed.

611
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,360
You got missing persons
and a fire in the next county.

612
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,940
Go do something useful.

613
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,130
I mean it, now, leave them alone.

614
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,400
You don't have to believe I'm psychic.

615
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,280
You don't have to believe a word I say.

616
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,130
But I've come a very long way to see you.

617
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,320
You know...

618
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,240
...I'm not sure we should be talking
to anybody right now.

619
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,440
Let's go.

620
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,780
You found all those bodies...

621
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,130
...down in that cellar.

622
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:29,900
I saw them, too.

623
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,170
How?

624
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,320
Dreamed it.

625
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,210
I dream a lot of things.

626
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,740
You see the cats yet?

627
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,740
I saw you with all those cats, too.

628
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,820
The diner.

629
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,050
That was you. You called us.

630
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,280
Will you excuse me for a second?

631
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,400
Darry, I need to talk-
I need you to listen and not talk.

632
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:02,050
Truth be, I'd be Iying if I said I knew
that telling you this would do any good.

633
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,510
Any good?

634
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,360
What does that mean?

635
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,860
Every 23rd spring...

636
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,170
...for 23 days...

637
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:15,710
...it gets to eat.

638
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,550
Eat?

639
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,740
You know what it eats,
and don't you make me tell you.

640
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,440
You think I like having this in my head?

641
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,360
I don't.

642
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,550
I don't like knowing this
and not knowing why I do.

643
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,780
You said it eats?

644
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,740
Only certain things...

645
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,630
...from certain people.

646
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,980
Just get away from her.

647
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:47,940
It eats lungs so it can breathe...

648
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,980
...and eyes so it can see.

649
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,210
It all becomes a part of it.

650
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:02,240
Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.

651
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,590
It dresses like a man...

652
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,240
...but only to hide that it's not.

653
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:26,510
You hurt it out there on the road...

654
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:30,240
...but only as much as it can be hurt.

655
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,940
'Cause it can keep on eating...

656
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,480
...till it isn't hurt no more.

657
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,820
You've got something it likes, one of you.

658
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:50,050
And it's not gonna stop chasing you
till it knows which one.

659
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,400
How?

660
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,860
Never mind how.

661
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,550
How does it find out,
by running people off the road?

662
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,740
It needs to scare you.

663
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:03,440
There's something in fear,
something it can smell.

664
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:07,400
Something that tells it
if there's anything inside someone...

665
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,010
...that it might like.

666
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:16,050
You're telling us this thing
is out driving down the highway...

667
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,510
...trying to freak people out
so it can smell them?

668
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,400
Christ, Darry!
Why are we standing here with her?

669
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:25,780
Hello?

670
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,550
We got lights and phones out up here!

671
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,780
Would somebody talk to me?

672
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,940
It's gone.

673
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,090
We ran it over till there was nothing left.

674
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,780
What the hell,
have we got emergency lights or what?

675
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,510
People, we're going into
a lockdown situation.

676
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,240
That means everybody sit tight.

677
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,940
Don't move unless
somebody wearing a badge tells you.

678
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:57,210
We pounded it to dust.

679
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,780
We watched it blow the fuck away.

680
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,630
I think it's eaten too many hearts
for its own to ever stop.

681
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,980
Heads up, gentlemen.

682
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,630
Let me see some skin.

683
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,590
Are you in a coma, buddy?

684
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,440
What is wrong with you, man?

685
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,740
We have a blackout.
That means emergency head count.

686
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,860
Hey, lower bunk, let me see some skin.

687
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,980
That is special. I love you, too.

688
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,860
Heads up. Move it, down there.

689
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,240
Thank you for joining us.

690
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,630
Show me some skin, that's it.

691
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,130
Heads up, gentlemen.

692
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,590
Okay, you two.
You kids wanna come with me?

693
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,630
We're putting you in a holding room.

694
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:39,320
You can't do that! He finds you in here!

695
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,510
He finds you hiding in a room!

696
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:42,480
You, too.

697
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:47,170
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?"

698
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,710
We heard it in the car hours ago.
No.

699
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,240
It's playing on an old phonograph.

700
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,860
Escort Jezelle here
to the big blue Winnebago...

701
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,820
...she's no doubt
blocking the driveway with.

702
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,130
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

703
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,740
I swear I will lock you up, Jez.

704
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,780
I hear it playing
while one of you is screaming.

705
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,820
Screaming down in the dark somewhere.

706
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,780
Screaming the last scream
you'll ever scream!

707
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,630
Goddamn it, knock it off!

708
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,510
What exactly are you doing here?

709
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,240
Up top? Anybody on ground level?
We have an 11-99.

710
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,900
I repeat, an 11-99.

711
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,320
This is Tubbs, go ahead.

712
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,780
We got a situation down here, Sarge.

713
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:26,320
It's headed towards you,
up the rear stairs. You copy?

714
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,510
Coming up the rear stairwell.

715
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,090
Stay here.

716
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,590
I'm gonna get you out of here.

717
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,360
Come on, I said!

718
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,400
Somebody down there talk to me.

719
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,710
We have one inmate and one officer down.

720
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,320
Ramirez, he's hurt bad.

721
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,780
The son of a bitch
tried to take a bite out of him.

722
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,170
He what?

723
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,240
This guy is wearing something.

724
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,820
'Cause I'm a son of a bitch,
but we cannot take him down.

725
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:15,780
What do you mean, "wearing something"?

726
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,710
You'd think I was crazy if I told you.

727
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,170
This is about the weirdest fucking
body armor you've ever seen.

728
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,480
Where is he?

729
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,170
Talk.
He's gone.

730
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,670
He's gone, Sarge.
This guyjust climbed up the fucking wall.

731
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,980
You are not making
one goddamn bit of sense.

732
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,740
You can put me in a straitjacket,
but this fuckeris gone.

733
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,510
Gone? What the hell you talking about?

734
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,210
This guy's a real
mover and a shaker, Sarge.

735
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,170
We just lost him on the stairwell.

736
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,210
I can't see! I can't see!

737
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,090
He's heading right up to you. Copy?

738
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:23,980
Shit.

739
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,360
This is your way out?

740
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,940
These must lock automatically
if the power's out.

741
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,050
You didn't know that?

742
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,980
I don't dream everything!

743
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,210
This isn't everything! This is our way out!

744
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:39,320
It's not like watching a movie, honey.
There are parts missing sometimes.

745
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:48,670
We have to get out of here now.

746
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,550
There's no other way except the front...

747
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:58,710
The front door is out.
Why don't you dream up something useful?

748
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,940
I thought if you knew what I saw,
maybe you could change it.

749
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,980
Why the hell do you think I'm here?

750
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,940
You know.

751
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,440
Don't you?

752
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,550
You knew when you walked in.

753
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,740
You know who it wants.

754
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,170
You know what it wants.
I've dreamed this.

755
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,780
You know what's gonna happen.

756
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:33,630
You will run up the stairs and hide,
but I don't know what happens to me.

757
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,360
Jeepers Creepers.

758
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,510
Jeepers Creepers, right?

759
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,590
Who?

760
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:43,900
Who hears Jeepers Creepers
while screaming in the dark?

761
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:54,130
Are they ever wrong?

762
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,440
I don't believe you.

763
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,010
You don't understand.

764
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,550
Your dreams, are they ever wrong?

765
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,860
You go to hell.

766
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,280
I said, "You don't understand."

767
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,360
Are they ever wrong?
Are your dreams every wrong?

768
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:10,670
She doesn't know.

769
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,630
She doesn't know shit.

770
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,360
Get upstairs!

771
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,010
Now!

772
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,630
Our Father, who art in heaven...

773
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,050
...hallowed be Thy...

774
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,210
What in the holy name of God?

775
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,320
Take me.

776
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:47,630
You don't want him.

777
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,980
Whatever you want,
you can take it from me.

778
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,940
You don't want Darry.

779
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,240
No, you don't.

780
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,550
Don't you be a hero!

781
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:04,240
I have everything the same inside.
You take me!

782
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,510
You hear me? You take me.
You fucking let him go!

783
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,510
Please, let him go.

784
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,710
Trish, please don't do this.

785
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,480
Just think for a second.

786
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:24,670
I won't fight you. You can take me.

787
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,710
I'm stronger. You want me.

788
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:38,710
Drop him.

789
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,360
Let him go and take me.

790
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:45,900
You let him go!

791
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:58,510
Darry!

792
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,860
Your folks just pulled up outside.

793
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,940
You never answered him.

794
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,740
Are your dreams ever wrong?

795
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:22,860
Darry screaming in the dark
while that song is playing.

796
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,320
What did that mean?

797
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,050
What did you really see?

798
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:32,980
I'm just a crazy old woman.

799
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,480
You ask anyone around here,
they'll tell you.

800
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,900
That's all I am.

801
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,860
Just a crazy old woman...

802
