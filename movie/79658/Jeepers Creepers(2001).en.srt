1
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,533
-You actually lied for me.
-I lied for me.

2
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,536
No, come on. You lied for both of us.

3
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,707
You actually did something decent for me.
That's a part of history you can't change.

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,921
That was a stop sign.

5
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,422
You're kidding, right?

6
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,424
In your car, I'd be kidding?

7
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,928
On this road?
I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.

8
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,939
Come on, Darry.

9
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,161
"Gay Fever!"

10
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,746
No, "Gay Forever."

11
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,957
"Gay Forever." That's mine.

12
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,084
That's three for little bro'.

13
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,212
That's a 6, not a G, you idiot.

14
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,589
That's "Sexy Forever." That's mine.

15
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,633
-That's five to two.
-Shit.

16
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,677
"Gay Fever?"

17
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,984
Sexy forever, huh?

18
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,362
You know that is you in 40 years.

19
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,077
There's usually a reason
when you like the long way home.

20
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,080
Gee, like, maybe I like the country?

21
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:26,999
Okay.

22
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,375
Just drive, brat.

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm only thinking the same thing
Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking.

24
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:36,925
"Trisha, why are you driving home
for spring break with your brat brother...

25
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:41,513
"...and not heading off somewhere with
that nice 'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?"

26
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,932
I will tell them the same thing I'll tell you:

27
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,976
None of your goddamn business.

28
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,103
What?

29
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,024
You don't think I could understand
the complex nature of your relationships?

30
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,610
No, I look at you as a real expert.

31
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,029
Whatever. I don't care.

32
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,532
I'm just saying,
if you broke it off with him...

33
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:04,036
...you should at least figure out
what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad.

34
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,329
They're the ones in love with the guy.

35
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,331
What would Jesus do....

36
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,627
I am no fanatic. What I am is a fan of Godl

37
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,546
...a serpent-headed demon,
shaking you by the....

38
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,883
You wanted the back way home.

39
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,135
That's 10 hours of preachers, farm reports--

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,638
Could you possibly just shut up
and drive, please?

41
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,892
"You broke my heart in two

42
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,437
"Now I can't find the duct tape

43
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,856
"To put it together for you

44
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,650
Come on, girl, sing along now.

45
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,736
"When I met you, I thought I would die

46
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,489
"I wanted to cry

47
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,075
"Didn't know you were evil

48
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,661
"or that you would hurt me

49
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,873
"Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team guy

50
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,460
"Turns out you're a twit and a real--"

51
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,589
Jesus!

52
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,887
-What the hell is his problem?
-Just get out of his way, Darry!

53
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,935
Let him pass you, Darry!
What are you doing?

54
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,523
Go around me!

55
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,779
Get off the road and let him pass you!

56
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,699
-He's nuts!
-I know he's nuts. Pull over!

57
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,786
Go around me!

58
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,998
-Slow down and let him fucking pass you!
-I'm trying!

59
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,805
Jesus!

60
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,099
Shit!

61
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,602
What the hell was his problem?

62
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,273
My first guess? Inbreeding!

63
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,235
Get a load of that nasty old thing.

64
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,823
What is that, the vehicle of choice
for assholes and fucking serial killers?

65
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,453
God.

66
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,457
You know what I just thought of, right?

67
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,126
Kenny and Darla?

68
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,630
They died about a 100 miles from here.

69
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,925
-The same highway.
-This highway runs the length of the state.

70
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,470
You believe it?

71
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,431
That they had to go looking for her head?

72
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,558
That they never found them, only the car.

73
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,937
No, they never found her head.
They found the car.

74
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,855
Didn't find him or her head.

75
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,732
Look at me, I'm still shaking!

76
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,652
You don't think every generation
has their cautionary tale...

77
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,779
...of drinking and driving on Prom night?

78
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,574
I always heard it was true.
Wheaton Valley High, class of '78.

79
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,578
You wanna know something?

80
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,872
When I first heard that story...

81
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,795
...I used to think this was the highway
I would die on.

82
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,507
Quite the cheery thinker today,
aren't we, sis?

83
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,345
What's "Poli-Sci Guy"
been doing to you, anyway?

84
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,682
"Beating you?"

85
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,978
That was the license plate
on the van we just saw.

86
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,813
B-E-A-T-N-G-U.

87
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,984
So "Beating You."

88
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,279
That's mine. That's three to five.

89
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,197
-You can't call it now.
-My ass!

90
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,825
-You have to call it when you see it.
-I was in shock!

91
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,411
-Tough!
-What is this, a brand new rule?

92
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,704
It's always been this way.

93
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,372
-Since when?
-Since always.

94
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,374
Since just now, maybe.

95
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,085
-Your memory's for shit.
-No, it's not.

96
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,304
Nah, infinity.

97
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,307
Uh-huh, infinity squared.

98
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,228
-Okay, name it.
-What?

99
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,940
When we made the rule that you had to
call it as soon as you see it.

100
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,109
Would you give it up already?

101
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,820
That's 'cause the rule has always been...

102
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,531
...the first person who calls it, gets it.

103
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,117
You talk to Mom lately?

104
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,620
To tell her I'd be home for break.

105
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,623
She sound weird?

106
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,334
What?

107
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,628
Did you listen to her voice?

108
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,880
Could you specify, please?

109
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,840
Forget it.

110
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,051
Did you drink the last water?

111
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,261
The last one was mine.

112
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,351
You are a class act, you know that?

113
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,061
You live off-campus.

114
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,730
You ever try and do laundry in a dorm?

115
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,316
What they don't steal, they dye pink.

116
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,153
I've got 12 pairs of rosy-pink jockey shorts.

117
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,864
Maybe they know something about you,
you don't.

118
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,284
"Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever.
Here's my dirty shorts."

119
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,203
It's for her, not me.

120
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,291
What? I have to bring home laundry.
lf I don't, she gets depressed.

121
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,587
She thinks I don't need her anymore
or something.

122
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,214
I'm serious.

123
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,758
-Goof.
-Bitch.

124
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,804
-Mama's boy.
-Daddy's whore.

125
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,973
-Dick licker.
-Ball sniffer.

126
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,268
-Ass kisser.
-Butt picker.

127
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,980
Repeat. "Ass" and "butt." You lose.

128
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,409
-I think maybe something's wrong.
-You always think something's wrong.

129
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:40,372
Like you would notice anything past the
point of your own selfish little existence.

130
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,791
She's not happy.

131
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,503
-Not like she used to be.
-Who is?

132
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,298
Mom's not--

133
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,097
It's "Beating You."

134
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,855
What's he doing?

135
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,110
What the hell is that?

136
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,252
What the hell was he doing?

137
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,047
He dumped something down that pipe.

138
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,882
Wrapped in a sheet.

139
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,551
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.

140
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,721
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it.

141
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,433
Just get us out of here.

142
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,185
-Grab my cell phone.
-Where?

143
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,853
It's in the gym bag.

144
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,572
Oh, Jesus....

145
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,326
You gotta be kidding me.

146
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,625
The point of having a portable phone
is that it works when you need it!

147
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,918
I have a power cable for it.

148
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,879
And I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.

149
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,674
Goddamn it, what did I say? My car!

150
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,384
We should've taken my car!

151
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,805
He's coming up right on our ass.

152
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:31,775
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped up or something.

153
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,995
Darry....

154
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:49,126
-He's coming up right on our ass.
-What the fuck is in that thing?

155
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,595
You're out of your fucking mind!

156
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,314
What the hell's your problem?

157
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:20,115
Fuck me! Go!

158
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,244
What the hell's the matter with you!

159
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,253
-Darry, what are you doing?
-Hang on.

160
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,838
Just don't kill us, okay?

161
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,894
Sounds all right.

162
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,896
What?

163
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,274
Like either one of us would know.

164
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,984
I know a little.

165
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,902
Your car makes a strange noise...

166
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,113
...you just get a new tape, Darry.
You told me.

167
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,614
I told you?

168
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,075
I learned it from you.

169
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,911
Jesus Christ....

170
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,831
Whoa, wait.

171
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,795
I'm thinking past the point of my own
selfish little existence now, okay?

172
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,304
We're both pretty damn sure what
we saw him dump down that pipe, right?

173
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,683
What if it's someone still alive?

174
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,228
What if it was?

175
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,856
Someone who needs help.

176
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,317
We can get help as fast
by getting to a phone.

177
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,444
You have any idea how far
to the nearest phone?

178
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,029
We were just attacked!

179
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,740
And you don't even wanna find out why?

180
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,245
We look in the pipe, that's it.

181
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,540
Is this your idea of a little adventure
or something?

182
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,834
'Cause this is why girls are smarter, okay?

183
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,254
We look in the pipe, if there's
nothing there, nothing we can do...

184
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,632
...we just drive on home and call the cops.

185
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,467
You know that's what we should do.

186
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,636
-Bullshit, I do.
-Bullshit, you don't!

187
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,556
Look me in the eye and tell me
you can just drive away.

188
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,600
Leave who's ever back there, back there.

189
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,937
Maybe find out later they'd still be alive
if you'd just gone back.

190
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,147
Don't make this about
the right thing to do.

191
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:01,777
You just wanna go back there see if there's
something nasty at the end of that pipe.

192
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,155
Okay.

193
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,660
And what if it was you back there?

194
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,210
I'm not getting out of this car.

195
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,212
-You don't have to.
-I'm not.

196
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,029
Jesus, it's a church.

197
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,586
What's with all the birds?

198
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,641
I'm just gonna look.

199
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,788
Let's do this and do it fast.

200
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,104
Oh, my God.

201
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:51,196
-Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
-Doesn't smell like one either.

202
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,201
Come on, you can't see anything in there.

203
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,495
You can see light down there.

204
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,789
Get a flashlight.

205
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,709
Come on, get a flashlight.

206
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,836
Hello!

207
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,299
Anybody down there?

208
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,930
Hey! Anybody down there?

209
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:26,815
Hello!

210
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,570
Hurry up. Come on.

211
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:33,739
Hello!

212
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,326
There's someone there, I heard them.

213
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,994
Hello!

214
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,748
You're hearing things, Darry.

215
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,044
Darry, don't even think about it!

216
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,005
-Darry!
-I told you I heard someone.

217
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,299
You know the part in scary movies...

218
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,635
...where somebody does something
really stupid...

219
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,553
...and everybody hates them for it?

220
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,763
This is it.

221
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,060
-Hello!
-No, Darry!

222
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,937
-Let me slide down.
-God damn it!

223
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,481
-Let me get a little way in.
-You're not going.

224
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,943
I'm not. Just hold my feet.

225
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,570
The feet?

226
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,585
Anybody down there?

227
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,256
When was the last time
you washed these socks?

228
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,216
I see something.

229
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,386
-Hello!
-I am counting to 10.

230
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,637
Something's moving.

231
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,973
Then I am letting go
and going back to my car.

232
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,766
Quiet!

233
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,601
I just saw it again.

234
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,771
Something is definitely moving
down there.

235
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,649
Rats!

236
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,192
-What?
-Rats!

237
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:56,613
Rats!

238
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,135
Darry!

239
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,015
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!

240
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,312
Darry, say something!

241
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,401
Are you okay?

242
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,243
How are you gonna get out of there, Dar?

243
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,004
You suck.

244
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,758
God, I am so sorry.

245
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,426
I bet you are.

246
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,178
I am. I don't know what happened.

247
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,263
You were kicking and I couldn't hold on--

248
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,848
Not as sorry as I am.

249
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,143
There were rats coming at my face.

250
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,437
They were running at me too, Trish.

251
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,487
I feel really bad. Are you okay?

252
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,075
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.

253
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,370
Trisha Jenner,
coming through in the clutch.

254
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,580
Thank you.

255
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,211
You were the one who wanted to come
and have a little adventure.

256
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,587
Shut up.

257
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,966
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there?

258
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,188
Darry?

259
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,527
What?

260
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:06,994
Darry?

261
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,131
Say it isn't so.

262
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,811
Did I hear you talking?

263
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:43,614
Darry, who in the holy hell
are you talking to down there?

264
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,158
I found our body.

265
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,285
-You what?
-I found our--

266
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,354
What?

267
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,255
Darry?

268
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,595
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!

269
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,725
Darry, tell me what's going on!

270
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,105
What?

271
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,399
We gotta get out of here.

272
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,943
No, let's stay and feed the birds.

273
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,029
Get help.

274
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,281
Get help, Trish.

275
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:51,950
What are you looking at?

276
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:55,120
Get out to the road
and find somebody who can help.

277
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,164
How are you gonna get out of there?

278
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,043
This is some kind of basement, right,
for the church?

279
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:06,048
You don't think I'm going in there, do you?

280
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,592
Get out to the road,
flag down anyone you see...

281
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:11,261
...tell them to get the cops out here
right away.

282
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,639
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.

283
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,140
And Trish...

284
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,060
...if you see that old truck coming...

285
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:21,939
...you get back to this pipe,
you holler down as loud as you can.

286
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,651
You just had to say that, right?

287
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,191
God damn it, Darry!

288
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:41,902
You asshole!

289
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,496
Darry?

290
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,892
Would you please just say something?

291
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,614
Darry, you're scaring the shit out of me!

292
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,415
We have to stop.

293
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:42,004
Did you hear me?

294
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:46,216
Darry?

295
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,010
She did lose her head.

296
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,682
Darla lost her head just like they said.

297
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,148
And you know what he did, Trish?

298
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,943
You know what he did for her?

299
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,572
He sewed it back on.

300
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,827
He sewed it right back on.

301
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:55,035
You gonna make a phone call?

302
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:02,167
Throw some water on yourself.

303
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:04,962
You look like
you just crawled out of a sewer.

304
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,983
He's going back.

305
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,113
He's going back. Come on!

306
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:40,372
Excuse me.

307
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:43,542
Excuse me, we need help.

308
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,840
I need you to please call the police.

309
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:52,134
The police?

310
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,929
We need help now, please!

311
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:07,691
Just go tell them what you saw
so we can get out of here, okay?

312
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,612
Come on, brat!

313
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,948
I mean it. I need you to hold it together.

314
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,328
Look at me, Darry.

315
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:23,582
I'm so scared, Trish.

316
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,253
I am so scared.

317
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,631
I'm scared, too, all right?

318
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,884
He's gonna get back to that church...

319
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,136
...and he's gonna know that we were there.

320
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:54,613
Are you gonna get that?

321
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:01,370
-Yeah, hello.
-Have you seen the cats yet?

322
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:05,499
-You and your brother.
-Me and my brother?

323
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,502
You and Darry. I saw you with lots of cats.

324
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:11,213
Who the hell is this?
How do you know Darry?

325
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:12,589
Who is this?

326
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:15,384
Darry?
You know the cats I'm talking about?

327
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,593
Who is this?

328
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:18,345
You have a torn shirt, right?

329
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,097
And a bloody hand.

330
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:23,934
Shirt's torn just above
a small rose tattoo...

331
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,477
...on your stomach.

332
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,772
Who is this?

333
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:30,649
How the hell do you know us?

334
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,985
You found its house of pain.

335
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:34,695
The what?

336
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,905
Those bodies down there...

337
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,199
...that's what it likes to call it...

338
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,410
...its house of pain.

339
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,288
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

340
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:48,292
I don't know if it's a demon or a devil...

341
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,919
...or just some hungry thing...

342
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:53,213
...from some dark place in time.

343
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,716
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

344
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:59,428
I just know it's not gonna stop
coming after you...

345
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,388
...or anyone else it wants to.

346
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:06,310
Once it has the scent
of something it likes...

347
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,398
...it can't stop.

348
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:13,609
-Is what....
-What is she saying?

349
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,611
I saw that awful truck, too.

350
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,821
With the license plate.

351
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,531
"Beating You?"

352
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,950
The license plate on its truck.

353
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,410
Right, "Beating You"?

354
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:25,162
No, think about it.

355
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:29,249
Think about it, for Christ's sake.

356
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,460
Hold on. I need you to listen to this.

357
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:36,006
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?

358
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,927
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

359
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,180
Okay.

360
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,432
You hear that song, you run.

361
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,602
And I mean run.

362
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:51,855
'Cause that song means
something terrible for you.

363
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,275
Something so terrible
you couldn't dream of it...

364
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:58,278
...not in your worst,
most terrible nightmare.

365
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,197
Fuck you, lady!

366
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,159
Darry.

367
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,045
Darry?

368
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:18,757
Hello?

369
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,803
Let's talk with the cops
and get the hell out of here.

370
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,281
Maybe you should've left out the part
about that phone call.

371
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,624
It just sounds too much like a bad dream.

372
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,502
Everything I said I saw, I saw.

373
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:03,260
What, you think I bumped my head
down there or something?

374
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:04,595
I didn't say that.

375
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,722
You believe me, right?

376
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:09,391
Right?

377
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,688
Look me in the eye
and tell me you believe me.

378
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:19,568
Look me right in the eye right now,
you tell me you believe everything I said!

379
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,448
We're running the plates...

380
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:27,743
...and we've got some people
on their way out to the old church.

381
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,954
These kids you saw on that wall,
who were they again?

382
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:34,458
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...

383
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,293
...Brandon.

384
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,713
Found their car all smashed up
about 20 years ago.

385
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:42,257
-Am I remembering this right?
-Yeah.

386
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:45,344
Those bodies would be
nothing but bones by now.

387
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,266
You said they still had skin on them
and he had a ring on his finger.

388
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:52,893
What are you saying?

389
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,312
I told you, I grabbed one of them like this.

390
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:57,940
And it was hard, like petrified wood.

391
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,025
Like he preserved them or something.

392
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,945
He's got them all stitched together
like some kind of quilt.

393
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:06,573
-I'm just trying to get all the facts here.
-And I told you the facts!

394
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,867
This guy drives an old brown truck...

395
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,786
...and it nearly killed us.

396
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,747
We saw him throw a body down a pipe...

397
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:16,500
...that dumps into the cellar
of that old church.

398
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:20,754
This guy must have 500,
maybe 600 bodies down there...

399
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,339
...and I've seen them!

400
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,885
Stuck up on the walls...

401
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:30,931
...like some psycho version
of the Sistine Chapel!

402
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,059
What, you don't believe me?

403
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:37,271
Drive out to the old church
if you think I'm lying.

404
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,064
No one's saying you're lying.

405
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,983
Good, because I'm not lying!

406
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,609
Look at this from my point of view.

407
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:45,362
This is a pretty big story
you're laying on us here.

408
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:49,408
That's your car out at the pumps, isn't it?

409
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,591
Bunch of folks saw him from the window.

410
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:08,302
The man there at your car.

411
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,099
He was standing there at your car...

412
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,935
...sniffin' that laundry...

413
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:21,315
...holding big handfuls of it under his nose.

414
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,110
Looked like he was liking it, too.

415
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,240
Which way he run off, Binky?

416
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,746
Still think I bumped my head?

417
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,878
He had time to get to the church,
then back here.

418
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,422
This guy is after us!

419
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:48,425
And he's after us
'cause he knows what we saw.

420
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,932
And now he even knows my name.

421
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:02,481
Central, this is 037. Come back.

422
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:06,777
You interested in a hand print?

423
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,946
037, go ahead, please.

424
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,579
037, this is Central.

425
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,456
Go ahead.

426
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,086
You can dust that, right? Get a print?

427
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:31,051
Looks like somebody already did.

428
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:37,266
037, what's going on out there?

429
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:41,979
037, I need a response, please.

430
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:44,690
There is definitely some
weird shit going on.

431
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,192
This is Central. 037, that is an affirmative.

432
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,279
We should all just get in the car and go.
We should go.

433
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:51,989
What is your situation?

434
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,664
037, please respond.

435
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,383
How'd he get to the church
and back to the diner so fast?

436
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:17,139
What the hell was he doing
with your clothes?

437
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:20,517
He drives fast, but not that fast.

438
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:27,024
Maybe he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

439
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:30,944
He'd have to be superhuman.
Otherwise, the smell would've killed him.

440
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:35,532
Please come back, 037, out there on East 9.

441
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,118
Central, this is 037. Go ahead.

442
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:41,121
You sure that's not a couple of
little pyromaniacs...

443
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:43,248
...you're escorting out there?

444
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:44,958
Go ahead.

445
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,127
This old church is on fire.

446
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,922
I'm talking burning out of control.

447
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:53,175
I'm up to my ass in Fire and Rescue,
but I can tell you...

448
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,761
...no one's going inside this thing
for a long time.

449
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:57,638
Incest capital of the world.

450
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:59,848
Don't be such a snot.

451
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:06,772
Don't tell me you actually like him.

452
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:08,357
Who?

453
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,734
Please.

454
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,445
I thought the waitress had dialed
the wrong number.

455
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,031
The guy looked like a strip-o-gram cop.

456
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,662
Like the missing link.

457
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:25,916
I wanna bring him to my Anthro class
for show and tell.

458
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,167
In sports, the national....

459
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:35,467
"Jeepers..."

460
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,886
-That's the song!
-What's the matter with you?

461
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,096
The words are the same.

462
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:41,890
"Creepshow,
where did you get those eyes...."

463
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:43,475
What is the matter with you?

464
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:46,353
That's the same song
that lady on the phone was playing!

465
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:50,983
These kids say the vehicle chased them
doing over 100, go ahead.

466
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:54,403
A preliminary came back on that dust
you took off the car handle.

467
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:55,904
It's dead skin.

468
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:57,781
Long dead. That's why it was powder.

469
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,616
Say what?

470
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,619
That's it! The words are the same, listen!

471
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:04,997
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those weepers."

472
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:10,127
Hold on, Central, the sky is falling.

473
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,932
She was playing this song to us,
and she said if we heard it....

474
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:31,440
This is it.

475
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:24,660
037, come in.

476
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,374
Are you okay in there?

477
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:43,220
037, this is Central. Come in.

478
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,231
Trish?

479
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:55,691
I said hello!

480
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,277
Get back in the car.

481
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,070
Central, this is 04....

482
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:02,614
Get back in the car, Trish!

483
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,570
What is that?

484
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,496
I'm not seeing this.

485
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,597
What is he doing?

486
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:56,895
Go.

487
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,608
-I'm trying.
-Go, go, go!

488
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:06,697
-Go, go, go!
-I'm trying!

489
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:56,246
Come on, you're gonna kill us!

490
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,707
I mean it, slow down!

491
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:00,751
Slow down!

492
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:11,929
No way.

493
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,305
-There's a phone.
-So?

494
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:17,309
-So you just told me to stop.
-I didn't say, "Stop." I said, "Slow down."

495
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:19,853
-How far's the next town?
-You mean the next phone?

496
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:22,606
It's pretty god damn far.
You wanna wait to find out?

497
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,171
Come on, Trish, look at this place.
Let's just keep going.

498
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,340
I mean it, come on.

499
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,093
-You don't wanna get help?
-Help from who?

500
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:52,803
We'll just use the phone.

501
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,513
-And call who?
-I don't know.

502
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,265
-And tell them what?
-I don't know.

503
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:59,101
"Hey, bum-fuck police,
I'm being chased by a guy...

504
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:01,979
"...who pulls tongues out of
severed heads with his teeth.

505
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:03,981
"Is there a special extension for that?"

506
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:05,482
Come on.

507
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,361
Christ, do you think
they even have a phone?

508
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:12,489
I'm guessing no phone and a lot of guns.

509
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:13,949
Who are you?

510
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,670
I said, "Who are you?"

511
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:32,843
Patricia Jenner. This is my brother Darry.

512
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,305
-What do you want?
-A telephone?

513
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:39,850
I don't have one.

514
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,812
I say we keep driving till we see people.

515
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,814
What do you think she is?

516
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,527
What you need a phone for if I had one?

517
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:53,030
I need to call the Pertwilla County Police.

518
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:54,948
Pertwilla?

519
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:58,535
That's one county back.
You're in Poho County.

520
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:01,747
Then Poho Police.
But I need to call someone.

521
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:06,251
Don't even think about
bringing the cops out here...

522
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:08,629
...with their zoning crap.

523
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:14,259
They try to tell me
how many cats people can have.

524
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,472
I'll have as many cats as I wanna have.

525
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,849
You can tell them that for me.

526
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:23,060
Please, someone's been killed.

527
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:29,149
Killed, you say?

528
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,443
Yeah, a policeman.

529
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:34,071
Holy Jesus, I thought....

530
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:37,199
I thought you meant one of my babies.

531
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,286
-Did you hear what I just said?
-Let's get out of here.

532
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:47,751
You can call the Sheriff's station,
just don't give them this address.

533
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:52,172
And tell them to go out on the
interstate where they ought to be.

534
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:54,925
My babies don't like strangers.

535
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:57,928
How many babies do you have?

536
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,472
More than a couple.

537
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:03,976
We've gotta get out of here right now.

538
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,984
Tell me this happens all the time.

539
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:22,786
Holy shit.

540
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:50,397
You kids got anyone else with you?

541
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:52,608
What?

542
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:05,996
That's not my scarecrow.

543
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:18,550
You got 10 seconds...

544
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,637
...to get your ass out of my yard!

545
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:27,017
And don't think I'm gonna tell you twice.

546
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:34,942
-Get the hell away from him.
-What are you doing, Trish?

547
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,655
Get the hell away from him!

548
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:51,083
Come on. Let's go.

549
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,210
No. Don't you go up there.

550
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,212
-Listen to him!
-We gotta get out of here!

551
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:58,048
What the hell did you bring into my house?

552
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:02,803
Get out of here.

553
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:06,390
Get away from my babies,
you sons of bitches!

554
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,356
I'll blow your fucking head off!

555
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:05,616
Hello?

556
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:57,584
-Something's wrong.
-Don't say that!

557
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,920
What do you want me to say?
The gears are sticking!

558
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:02,631
-Unstick them, Trish!
-You're gonna break it!

559
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,261
-It's stuck in reverse!
-Go in reverse!

560
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:29,283
-What do we do?
-Hit him.

561
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,247
Hit him, Trish.

562
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:36,790
Hard.

563
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:40,711
Do it!

564
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:14,828
What the hell is that thing?

565
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,132
What the hell are you doing?

566
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:30,928
Come on, you son of a bitch.

567
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:37,476
That's right,
walk that ugly face right over here.

568
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,269
Come on.

569
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:40,562
Come on!

570
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:05,629
Do you think he's dead?

571
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:08,048
They never are.

572
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:36,660
Enough.

573
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,570
Let's get out of here.

574
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:56,323
Trish.

575
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:04,289
I don't know how much further
this car is gonna go.

576
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:06,083
Not far enough.

577
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:53,922
Roach.

578
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:56,592
What are we boosting tonight?

579
01:01:57,259 --> 01:02:00,846
Why don't you come over here
and find out, Big Daddy?

580
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:03,807
'76 Chevy Nova?

581
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:06,602
Anyone tell you, for a car thief,
you got taste for shit?

582
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,021
Would you tell Dad
to stop shouting, please?

583
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,522
Mom!

584
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:15,819
I understand that, Mother.

585
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:17,988
I'm just trying to tell you where we are.

586
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:22,326
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both okay.

587
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:28,540
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station
about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.

588
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:32,586
Because we'll be home
before you could get here.

589
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:37,633
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.

590
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:40,886
Mom, just let us get home, okay?

591
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,348
We don't wanna be out here
any more than you do.

592
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:45,933
Me, too.

593
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:49,478
I'll talk to you in a few hours.

594
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,859
Dad.

595
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:57,736
Thought I wrecked the car?

596
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,780
She's trailer trash.

597
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:01,573
-Pig fucker.
-Booger eater.

598
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:02,658
Trisha?

599
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:06,745
Trisha and Darry, right?

600
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:08,872
Jez, what are you doing here?

601
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:10,874
Excuse me, Jezelle?

602
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:13,460
Darry.

603
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:15,671
Darry Jenner.

604
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:19,883
-Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
-Come on. They've been through a lot.

605
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:21,260
-Trisha.
-Goddamn it, Jez.

606
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:24,596
I really need to talk to you,
if you could just spare me a minute.

607
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:27,349
Jezelle likes to think she's
the resident psychic here.

608
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:28,976
She helped us on a missing persons--

609
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:31,478
Could I just talk to these kids by myself?

610
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:34,273
You go home, turn off that police scanner,
and go to bed.

611
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,984
You got missing persons
and a fire in the next county.

612
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:38,610
Go do something useful.

613
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:40,904
I mean it, now, leave them alone.

614
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,282
You don't have to believe I'm psychic.

615
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:46,285
You don't have to believe a word I say.

616
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:49,246
But I've come a very long way to see you.

617
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:50,497
You know...

618
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:53,542
...I'm not sure we should be talking
to anybody right now.

619
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,793
Let' s go.

620
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:57,254
You found all those bodies...

621
01:03:57,838 --> 01:03:59,673
...down in that cellar.

622
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,593
I saw them, too.

623
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:05,971
How?

624
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:08,223
Dreamed it.

625
01:04:08,974 --> 01:04:11,226
I dream a lot of things.

626
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:14,938
You see the cats yet?

627
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:19,109
I saw you with all those cats, too.

628
01:04:19,985 --> 01:04:21,278
The diner.

629
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,572
That was you. You called us.

630
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:26,950
Will you excuse me for a second?

631
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:31,246
-Darry, I need to talk--
-I need you to listen and not talk.

632
01:04:31,622 --> 01:04:36,126
Truth be, I'd be lying if I said I knew
that telling you this would do any good.

633
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:37,628
Any good?

634
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:39,546
What does that mean?

635
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,174
Every 23rd spring...

636
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,636
...for 23 days...

637
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:50,349
...it gets to eat.

638
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:56,438
Eat?

639
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:59,775
You know what it eats,
and don't you make me tell you.

640
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:03,612
You think I like having this in my head?

641
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:05,614
I don't.

642
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:08,951
I don't like knowing this
and not knowing why I do.

643
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,286
You said it eats?

644
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,458
Only certain things...

645
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,461
...from certain people.

646
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:20,879
Just get away from her.

647
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:23,966
It eats lungs so it can breathe...

648
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:30,264
...and eyes so it can see.

649
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:34,685
It all becomes a part of it.

650
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:38,897
Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.

651
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,487
It dresses like a man...

652
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:50,367
...but only to hide that it's not.

653
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:04,214
You hurt it out there on the road...

654
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:08,093
...but only as much as it can be hurt.

655
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,930
'Cause it can keep on eating...

656
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,600
...till it isn't hurt no more.

657
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:23,275
You've got something it likes, one of you.

658
01:06:24,568 --> 01:06:28,739
And it's not gonna stop chasing you
till it knows which one.

659
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,242
How?

660
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:33,744
Never mind how.

661
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:36,580
How does it find out,
by running people off the road?

662
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,832
It needs to scare you.

663
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:42,711
There's something in fear,
something it can smell.

664
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,840
Something that tells it
if there's anything inside someone...

665
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:50,594
...that it might like.

666
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:55,849
You're telling us this thing
is out driving down the highway...

667
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:58,435
...trying to freak people out
so it can smell them?

668
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,438
Christ, Darry!
Why are we standing here with her?

669
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:06,026
Hello?

670
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,904
We got lights and phones out up here!

671
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:12,282
Would somebody talk to me?

672
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:13,450
It's gone.

673
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:16,745
We ran it over till there was nothing left.

674
01:07:17,746 --> 01:07:20,624
What the hell,
have we got emergency lights or what?

675
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,802
People, we're going into
a lockdown situation.

676
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:33,595
That means everybody sit tight.

677
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,390
Don't move unless
somebody wearing a badge tells you.

678
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,767
We pounded it to dust.

679
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:41,478
We watched it blow the fuck away.

680
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:48,610
I think it's eaten too many hearts
for its own to ever stop.

681
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:54,199
Heads up, gentlemen.

682
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,952
Let me see some skin.

683
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:58,996
Are you in a coma, buddy?

684
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:01,957
What is wrong with you, man?

685
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:04,376
We have a blackout.
That means emergency head count.

686
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,587
Hey, lower bunk, let me see some skin.

687
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:09,840
That is special. I love you, too.

688
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,843
Heads up. Move it, down there.

689
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:15,304
Thank you for joining us.

690
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:17,806
Show me some skin, that's it.

691
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:20,434
Heads up, gentlemen.

692
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:20,369
Okay, you two.
You kids wanna come with me?

693
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,454
We're putting you in a holding room.

694
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:25,290
You can't do that! He finds you in here!

695
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,584
He finds you hiding in a room!

696
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:28,585
You, too.

697
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:33,465
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?"

698
01:09:33,632 --> 01:09:36,093
-We heard it in the car hours ago.
-No.

699
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:38,762
It's playing on an old phonograph.

700
01:09:38,971 --> 01:09:41,473
Escort Jezelle here
to the big blue Winnebago...

701
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:43,517
...she's no doubt
blocking the driveway with.

702
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:45,936
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

703
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:47,604
I swear I will lock you up, Jez.

704
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:50,774
I hear it playing
while one of you is screaming.

705
01:09:50,941 --> 01:09:52,901
Screaming down in the dark somewhere.

706
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:54,945
Screaming the last scream
you'll ever scream!

707
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,905
Goddamn it, knock it off!

708
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:59,908
What exactly are you doing here?

709
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,787
Up top? Anybody on ground level?
We have an 11-99.

710
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:05,497
I repeat, an 11-99.

711
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:06,999
This is Tubbs, go ahead.

712
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:09,543
We got a situation down here, Sarge.

713
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:14,298
It's headed towards you,
up the rear stairs. You copy?

714
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:16,592
Coming up the rear stairwell.

715
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:18,218
Stay here.

716
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:23,974
I'm gonna get you out of here.

717
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:25,809
Come on, I said!

718
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:47,748
Somebody down there talk to me.

719
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:50,167
We have one inmate and one officer down.

720
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:51,835
Ramirez, he's hurt bad.

721
01:10:52,044 --> 01:10:54,421
The son of a bitch
tried to take a bite out of him.

722
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:55,839
He what?

723
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:01,136
This guy is wearing something.

724
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,847
'Cause I'm a son of a bitch,
but we cannot take him down.

725
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:05,891
What do you mean, "wearing something"?

726
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:07,893
You'd think I was crazy if I told you.

727
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:11,480
This is about the weirdest fucking
body armor you've ever seen.

728
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,942
Where is he?

729
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:17,736
-Talk.
-He's gone.

730
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:22,449
He's gone, Sarge.
This guyjust climbed up the fucking wall.

731
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:24,868
You are not making
one goddamn bit of sense.

732
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:30,874
You can put me in a straitjacket,
but this fuckeris gone.

733
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,752
Gone? What the hell you talking about?

734
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,588
This guy's a real
mover and a shaker, Sarge.

735
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,590
We just lost him on the stairwell.

736
01:11:38,924 --> 01:11:40,759
I can't see! I can't see!

737
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:43,762
He's heading right up to you. Copy?

738
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:19,566
Shit.

739
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:22,069
This is your way out?

740
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:24,738
These must lock automatically
if the power's out.

741
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,949
You didn't know that?

742
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,951
I don't dream everything!

743
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:31,286
This isn't everything! This is our way out!

744
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:35,582
It's not like watching a movie, honey.
There are parts missing sometimes.

745
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:45,342
We have to get out of here now.

746
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:49,388
There's no other way except the front....

747
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:55,811
The front door is out.
Why don't you dream up something useful?

748
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:59,189
I thought if you knew what I saw,
maybe you could change it.

749
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,275
Why the hell do you think I'm here?

750
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:08,532
You know.

751
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:12,202
Don't you?

752
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,498
You knew when you walked in.

753
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:22,963
You know who it wants.

754
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,508
-You know what it wants.
-I've dreamed this.

755
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:28,218
You know what's gonna happen.

756
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:32,222
You will run up the stairs and hide,
but I don't know what happens to me.

757
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:34,016
Jeepers Creepers.

758
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:36,268
Jeepers Creepers, right?

759
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:38,437
Who?

760
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:42,941
Who hears Jeepers Creepers
while screaming in the dark?

761
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:53,619
Are they ever wrong?

762
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:55,996
I don't believe you.

763
01:14:57,414 --> 01:14:58,707
You don't understand.

764
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:01,335
Your dreams, are they ever wrong?

765
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:03,754
You go to hell.

766
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:06,256
I said, "You don't understand."

767
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:09,468
Are they ever wrong?
Are your dreams every wrong?

768
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:10,844
She doesn't know.

769
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:12,888
She doesn't know shit.

770
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:18,852
Get upstairs!

771
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:20,604
Now!

772
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:30,614
Our Father, who art in heaven...

773
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:33,158
...hallowed be Thy....

774
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:44,141
What in the holy name of God?

775
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:51,607
Take me.

776
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:57,112
You don't want him.

777
01:18:57,237 --> 01:19:00,616
Whatever you want,
you can take it from me.

778
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:06,830
You don't want Darry.

779
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,249
No, you don't.

780
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,627
Don't you be a hero!

781
01:19:11,919 --> 01:19:14,463
I have everything the same inside.
You take me!

782
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:18,884
You hear me? You take me.
You fucking let him go!

783
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:29,311
Please, let him go.

784
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:31,605
Trish, please don't do this.

785
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:33,440
Just think for a second.

786
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:35,734
I won't fight you. You can take me.

787
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:37,861
I'm stronger. You want me.

788
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:50,374
Drop him.

789
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:54,211
Let him go and take me.

790
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,881
You let him go!

791
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:11,061
Darry!

792
01:21:10,245 --> 01:21:12,956
Your folks just pulled up outside.

793
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,595
You never answered him.

794
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:32,643
Are your dreams ever wrong?

795
01:21:34,728 --> 01:21:39,024
Darry screaming in the dark
while that song is playing.

796
01:21:39,608 --> 01:21:41,568
What did that mean?

797
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,489
What did you really see?

798
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,576
I'm just a crazy old woman.

799
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:53,205
You ask anyone around here,
they'll tell you.

800
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:55,749
That's all I am.

801
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,793
Just a crazy old woman...
