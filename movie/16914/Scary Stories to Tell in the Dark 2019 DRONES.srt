01:30:39,254 --> 01:30:40,490
����
Ramon!

1125
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:43,399
˿����
Stella!

1126
01:30:45,013 --> 01:30:46,410
��ҲҪ��������
Are you going to take him, too?

1127
01:30:47,803 --> 01:30:49,606
����˶������Ϊ
What your family did to you,

1128
01:30:50,707 --> 01:30:52,125
��������� ��������
what they said, that's on them.

1129
01:30:54,037 --> 01:30:55,433
�������Ϊ
But what you do,

1130
01:30:57,844 --> 01:30:59,431
������ ɯ��
this is on you, Sarah.

1131
01:31:02,934 --> 01:31:04,075
����ԭ��
It's all on you.

1132
01:31:12,112 --> 01:31:13,666
�һ�������Ĺ���
I'll tell your story.

1133
01:31:16,177 --> 01:31:18,402
��ʵ��Ĺ��� ��ʵ��ʵ˵
The real story, I'll tell the truth.

1134
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:22,851
����ŭ
But the rage,

1135
01:31:23,952 --> 01:31:26,339
��ķ�ŭ����ͣ ɯ��
the rage has to stop, Sarah.

1136
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,158
�����Ѫ��д
Use your blood.

1137
01:32:10,056 --> 01:32:12,793
ɯ��������˹���޹���
Sarah Bellows was innocent.

1138
01:32:13,254 --> 01:32:15,258
��֪������
She knew the truth,

1139
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:17,912
����ͼ��ֹ����
and tried to stop them.

1140
01:32:18,246 --> 01:32:19,129
�����¸�
She was brave.

1141
01:32:20,037 --> 01:32:24,591
���������˺��ݻ�
She was harmed and destroyed by her own family.

1142
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:26,806
����̰��
By their greed,

1143
01:32:27,652 --> 01:32:29,014
�������
and their lies

1144
01:32:29,796 --> 01:32:30,999
�������
and their sins.

1145
01:32:33,571 --> 01:32:34,775
����������Ĺ���
I'll tell your story.

1146
01:32:40,099 --> 01:32:41,334
����Խ�����
You can let it go.

1147
01:32:43,585 --> 01:32:44,981
���Ѱ� ɯ��
You can let it go, Sarah.

1148
01:33:28,539 --> 01:33:29,996
��������
Stories hurt.

1149
01:33:30,584 --> 01:33:32,044
��������
Stories heal.

1150
01:33:35,799 --> 01:33:38,955
�������һ���ظ� ���ǻ����
If we repeat them often enough, they become real.

1151
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,358
��������������
They have that power.

1152
01:33:44,982 --> 01:33:46,472
�������������
They make us who we are.

1153
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:47,496
˿����
Stella.

1154
01:33:47,574 --> 01:33:49,288
�Һܸ�����û��
I'm just so happy you're okay.

1155
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:04,455
����Ҵ�ɯ������ѧ����ʲô
And if there's anything I learned from Sarah,

1156
01:34:06,069 --> 01:34:07,848
�Ǿ�����������
it's to never give up.

1157
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:13,414
�Ұ��ճ�ŵ ��׼������ɯ���Ĺ���
I told Sarah's story exactly as I promised.

1158
01:34:15,122 --> 01:34:19,675
��д��: һ���԰׹¶��Ĺ��� �ںڰ���д����
I wrote about the pale, lonely girl who wrote stories in the dark.

1159
01:34:20,946 --> 01:34:24,037
���ļ��˰�����ɹ���
And how she was turned into a monster by her family.

1160
01:34:27,152 --> 01:34:30,250
�������� �����������
Some people believed me. Most didn't.

1161
01:34:30,703 --> 01:34:31,968
��Ϊ ��ͬɯ��
Because, like Sarah,

1162
01:34:32,397 --> 01:34:36,383
�ҹ�Ůһö �ὲ�ֲ�����
I was a lonely girl who knew how to tell a good creepy story.

1163
01:34:43,341 --> 01:34:44,225
д�Ÿ���
Write me?

1164
01:34:56,075 --> 01:34:57,215
ÿ��
Every day.

1165
01:34:58,826 --> 01:34:59,805
�ټ�
See you around.

1166
01:35:04,330 --> 01:35:05,400

What's your name, kid?

1167
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:06,460
���ɡ�Ī����˹
Ramon Morales.

1168
01:35:11,015 --> 01:35:13,114
���½����ǹذ�
Stories can teach us to care.

1169
01:35:16,616 --> 01:35:19,676
�����������¸ҳ��� ����Ҫ�˴�
They make us brave enough to admit that we need each other.

1170
01:35:20,775 --> 01:35:23,258
������һ���� ���Ի�
Give us a home to go back to.

1171
01:35:35,269 --> 01:35:38,462
��˺Ͱ¼���ʧ��
Chuck and Auggie are still gone,

1172
01:35:39,203 --> 01:35:42,483
�����а취��������
but I know there is a way to bring them back

1173
01:35:42,564 --> 01:35:44,247
���ܾ�������
and that the secret is in the book.

1174
01:35:45,569 --> 01:35:47,572
���ǲ�������
And we won't stop...

1175
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,316
�����ҵ�����
until we find them.

1176
01:35:51,392 --> 01:35:56,392
