I'm going to 'Nam. Yeah.

17
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:17,019
Those commies

00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:49,722
I'd rather just stay in.

<i>Stella. Stella,</i>

this isn't about candy.
It's about payback.

39
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:24,439
Get all the eggs
and TP you can

40
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:26,039

Stella, please.

42
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:30,072

Hey!

47
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:45,882
You know
where you're going, kid?

48
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:48,825
Following the harvest.

49
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,840
Tonight only.

50
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,182
Mom. It's fine.

51
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,166
No, it's not.

52
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:07,641
Still a little loose
in the crotch.

53
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:09,466
One more.

54
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,825
Take that!

55
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,127
Bullseye.

00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:25,785
Hey, gimme.

59
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,521
Eat shit, Harold.

60
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,830

<i>Must be the season

62
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,460
What the hell
are you doing?

63
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,489
A little privacy, please!

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,081
Ugh.

65
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,230
I said Spider-Man.

66
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:00,277
Not a spider...

67
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,333
man.

68
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:03,096
Be happy
the Lord provided.

69
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,237
Mom, okay, jeez.

70
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,968
Mom, can I please breathe?

71
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:20,405
Be nice.

72
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:23,061
Okay! Can you please
stop hugging me like that?

73
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,782
Aren't you a little old to
be trick-or-treating? Hmm?

74
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:32,564
Aren't you too ugly
to go on a date?

75
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,389
You little turd.

76
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,341
Auggie's here, gotta run.

77
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,363
I don't wanna hear it.

78
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:38,836
Thought you were
gonna be Spider-Man.

79
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:40,788
Yeah, well,
get used to it, okay.

80
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,158
I got the goods,
so let's banana split.

81
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:49,876
Stop staring at my sister,

82
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,605
you perv.

Hey, can you not?

89
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,892
I mean,
these antennae aren't even realistic.

90
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,939
And, if anything,
a spider man

91
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,603
should have eight arms,
not four.

92
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:22,263
Okay. At least
I'm not a clown.

93
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:26,771
For the last time,
I'm a Pierrot.

94
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:29,714
It's a 17th-century character
from la commedia dell'arte.

95
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:31,189
Psst. Clown.

Do you even know
what's in those?

97
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,779
It's the same toxic chemicals that's
giving our troops Hodgkin's lymphoma

98
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,284
and curdling the breast milk
of the South Vietnamese.

99
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:40,852
- Mmm.
- And you ate them all.

100
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:42,067
Mmm.

101
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,147
Is that why
they taste so good?

102
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,619
Out of the way, clown.

103
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,346
Nerd!

104
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,948
Move!

105
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,475
- He's not gonna show.
- What? No, he'll show.

106
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,363
Okay, Milner does it
every year

107
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,902
and this year
will be his last.

108
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,618
Where are you, Tommy?

109
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,827
I heard
the school newspaper

110
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,715
is open to submissions again.

111
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:02,804
You should submit
some of your stories.

112
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:06,482
- Come and steal our candy, Tommy.
- No way.

113
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:07,953
I know our school.

114
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:10,067
They would disembowel me.

115
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,621
Pontiac Catalina.
It's him, it's him! Okay.

116
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,297
Okay, just act natural.

117
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,772
You said
we'd go out for dinner.

118
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,362
You and me.

119
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,187
How about some dessert?

120
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,724
Get ready, man.

121
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:32,146
Ha-ha! Suckers!

122
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,027
Oh, what's that smell?

123
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,202
- Oh, it's old-man undies!
- Ugh!

124

129
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,626
And now for the poo d'etat.

00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,305
Eat turd, shitbird!

131
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:01,905
Holy shit.

132
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:03,729
- Stop the car!
- Put it out!

133
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,481

Chucky, you little brat!

135
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:13,010
I don't know.
I knew she was

136
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:14,034
going on a date
but not with him.

137
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,152
Damn it!

138
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:17,713
I'm gonna murder them!

139
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:19,091

00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:59,951
So, what are you doing alone
at a drive-in?

167
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:01,519
What are you
still doing in my car?

168
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,734
I understand you're...

169
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:05,038
You're not from here,
are you?

170
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,118
Where are you from?

171
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,302
Forgive my friend.

172
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,094
He did not get enough
oxygen in the womb.

173
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:11,342
More than you, clown.

174
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,877
Can you guys stop?

175
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,383
It's him, not me.

176
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,813
Yeah, we're stopping.

177
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:18,609
Your friend
is a little nosy.

178
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,765
<i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

179
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,462
It's a good flick.

180
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,190
You've seen it?

181
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:32,558
"All right, Vince,
hit him in the head,

182
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,957
"right between the eyes."

183
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,334
That's the best flick
all year.

184
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,737
Yeah, yeah, it's...
It is.

185
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,160
Ramon.

186
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:43,664
Stella.

187
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:48,301
Chuck.

188
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:49,328
Auggie.

189
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:52,781
Get out of the car.

190
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,480
Get out of the car.

191
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,904
Get out of the car.

192
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,958
I don't think
that you heard me.

193
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,732
Everyone needs to get out.

194
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,176
- Mmm-mmm.
- Now.

195
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,341
You too,

196
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:17,040
wetback.

197
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,405
You're not going
to try and run away

198
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:25,776
like Mommy too,
now are you, Stella?

199
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:35,567
You smell like shit.

200
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,686
Get the hell off my car.

201
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,109
Hey, down in front.
You're blocking the view!

202
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:49,740
Come on!

203
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:50,861
I can't see the movie!

204
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:53,999
Hey! Get back in your car
or get the hell out of here!

205
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,111
Hey!

206
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,796
This ain't over.

207
00:10:58,798 --> 00:10:59,821
Let's go.

208
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:01,707
Move it, you idiot.

209
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,342
- Let's go.
- Huh?

210
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,988
Get back in your car.
Let's go. Come on.

211
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,983
Okay, let's go.

212
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:10,475
Where we goin'?

213
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:11,500
That way.

214
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:12,780
Okay,
we'll go together.

215
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,694
You okay?

216
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:19,375
Just excuse me
for a second.

217
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,383
Did I say something?

218
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,679
No, that asshole,
Tommy did.

219
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:31,210
Her mom left when she was
a kid, just like that.

220
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,355
Yeah, people wouldn't stop
talking about it, though.

221
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:34,923
You know,
we live in a small town.

222
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,004
Yeah, the gossip
got really mean.

223
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:38,859
Jeez.

224
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,331
Yeah,
but it still bothers her,

225
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,699
so I guess that stuff
sort of sticks with you.

226
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,039
Yeah, and we're like
her only friends now.

227
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:53,579
So, I would say she's
definitely not your type.

228
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,915
It's Stella.
She's not anyone's type.

229
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,026
Don't think I'd agree
with that.

230
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:00,234
You like every girl.
It doesn't count.

231
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,899
It's not every girl.

232
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,758
Tell me you at least
you got a switchblade.

233
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,218
Can I see your switchblade?

234
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,746
Did I say
I had a switchblade?

235
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:12,651
No, I guess
you didn't say you had...

236
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:14,094
- He has a switchblade.
- I know.

237
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:23,820
Well, it is
Halloween, so...

238
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,220
Do you want to see
a haunted house?

239
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,290
You weren't kidding.

240
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,277
Told you
it wouldn't disappoint.

241
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,681
I don't know, you'd think on
Halloween, this place would be hoppin'.

242
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:54,666
Oh, it was,
for a while,

243
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:57,097
then some kid went missing,
so they boarded it up.

244
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:59,787
I think it's being torn down
for a mall or something.

245
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:02,093
Hey, guys.

246
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,896
Clowns first.

247
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:12,107
Really?

248
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,849
Okay, there,
we saw it. Can we go now?

249
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:30,184
Who ordered the chicken?

250
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,200
Because I don't like to
spend my nights in a house

251
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:34,217
where a child murderer lived?

252
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:35,403
Someone was killed
in that house?

253
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:37,961
That's pretty dark.

254
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,017
Who lived here?

255
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:39,913
The Bellows.

256
00:13:39,915 --> 00:13:42,217
One of the first families
to settle here

257
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:44,136
in the late 19th century.

258
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,960
Built the paper mill
that pretty much

259
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,371
put this town
on the map.

260
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:51,466
We could at least
look for some stairs.

261
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:55,400
Yep.

262
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,935
Just as I thought.

263
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,337
They got this place locked up
pretty tight.

264
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,395
Anyone got a pen?

265
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:05,000
Meet Lola. She is madly
in love with me.

266
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:06,411
Yeah, your hand maybe.

267
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:08,167
Nice.

268
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,546
Lola! Hey, what?

269
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:23,946
He's so much
dreamier than you.

270
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,183
The Bellows
had a secret:

271
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,128
a daughter that they never
allowed to leave the house.

272
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,688
The myth is that there was
something really off about her.

273
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,872
A really scary part

274
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:48,934
is that her family erased her
from every single portrait.

275
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:52,938
To this day, nobody's ever
found a picture of Sarah.

276
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,690
They disowned her.

277
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:05,319
- Better run, clown.
- Shit!

278
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,953
Better run!

279
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:11,111
Bet you can't catch me!

280
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,375
Chuck,
if you jump out at me,

281
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:15,945
I'm going to punch you
in the throat.

282
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:19,175
So what happened
to her?

283
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:21,062
Kids would come
from all over

284
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:23,559
in hopes to get a peek
at Strange Sarah.

285
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:25,766
And though
they never saw her,

286
00:15:25,768 --> 00:15:27,401
they could hear her.

287
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,353
Through the wall.

288
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:33,000
Sarah told them stories.

289
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:36,008
Scary stories.

290
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,798
Some kids
never returned home.

291
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,653
Children around town died...

292
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:45,669
Poisoned, they said.

293
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:47,623
Everyone knew
it was Sarah.

294
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,342
But before the mob could even
get their hands on her,

295
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,485
she'd already hung herself

296
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:53,733
with her own hair.

297
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,693
And as the legend goes,

298
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:09,413
if you come to
the Bellows House at dark,

299
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:11,749
and ask Sarah
to tell you a story...

300
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,965
...it'll be the last story

301
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,277
you ever hear.

302
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,199
Mwa-ha-ha-ha!

303
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,704
Oh, what's this?

304
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,988
Push the other way.

305
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,272
Push.

306
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,719
No way.

307
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,631
Well, that's it.

308
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,317
Sarah's room.

309
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,629
You're not
going to scare me.

310
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:56,070
Chuck?

311
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:00,422
Chuck?

312
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:22,726
What the...

313
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:59,265
What?
Where's the old lady?

314
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,250
And the dog?

315
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:02,277
What old lady?

316
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,009
We gotta get out of here.

317
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:10,114
Stella! Stella!
We got to get out of here!

318
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,161
Stella, let's go!

319
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,340
Guys, you've gotta
see this! Come here.

320
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,720
Who ordered
the chicken?

321
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:24,260
Shut up.

322
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,218
This is where
her family kept her.

323
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,584
Locked her away
from the world.

324
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:34,240
All alone
as some sort of freak.

325
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:38,176
She must have just
sat right here

326
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,515
and told her stories to
the kids through this wall.

327
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,812
How have we never
seen this before?

328
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,459
I don't think
anyone wanted us to?

329
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,890
Can we get
out of here now?

330
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,521
What's that?

331
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,263
I can't believe it.

332
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:40,963
It's her book
of scary stories.

333
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:42,719
She had a book?

334
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:45,215
There's no book in the
version of the myth I heard.

335
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:46,978
The book is a part
of every version of the myth.

336
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:49,183
And...

337
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:51,743
that it was written
in children's blood.

338
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:53,919
Well, kids died
hearing these stories, okay?

339
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,935
Look, let's put it back
where you found it

340
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:57,055
and let's just
get out of here now.

341
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,463
Oh, shit!

342
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,360
I got it,
I got it, I got it.

343
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,383
Everybody, okay,
everybody just shut up.

344
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,326
Oh, no.
It's the old lady and the dog!

345
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,671
Tommy, stop it, okay?

346
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,174
Just let them out.

347
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,614
Ruth, is that you?

348
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,279
Will you open the door?

349
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:12,703
Joke's over.
If you don't open it...

350
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,273
- You can't do this! Come on!
- ...I'll tell the Chief.

351
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:19,393
Why would you do that?

352
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,295
This isn't funny!
Tommy, come on.

353
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:25,154
It's my little brother.

354
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,160
Please.

355
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:31,074
Open the damn door!

356
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:32,447
Open it.

357
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:35,169
Ruth! Down here.
Let us out!

358
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:40,960
You're trash anyway.

359
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,526
Tommy, I'm sorry
about the burning shit, man.

360
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:48,225
I hope you find
a way out.

361
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:50,173
Good?

362
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,710
Yeah.

363
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,598
- Get it off me!
- Oh, you're fine!

364
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,197
No! Get it off, get it off me!
Get it off me!

365
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,862
Hey!

366
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,110
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

367
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,157
- You're fine. I got it, I got it. It's fine.
- Something's bit me!

368
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,725
Hey, can you help me
with this?

369
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:03,101
- The spiders are gone.
- Thank you.

370
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:05,246
Jesus, Auggie.
Okay, you're such a horndog.

371
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:06,462
Can you lose your stiffy
for a second

372
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:07,486
and help us
get out of here?

373
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:09,853
Not funny!
There's a lady present.

374
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:12,288
Ladies... present.

375
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,549
Come on, come on!
You gotta push harder.

376
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,735
Come on.

377
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:24,288
Sarah Bellows,
tell me a story.

378
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:28,797
Tell me a story.

379
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,976
Sarah Bellows,
tell me a story.

380
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:48,733
Wait, wait, wait.
I hear something.

381
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:49,757
Someone's here.

382
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,781
He came back.

383
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:51,869
- Tommy!
- You got...

384
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,852
- We're sorry, we're real sorry.
- Thank you!

385
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:55,869
I... I take back
everything I ever said, man.

386
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:57,117
Sorry, man!

387
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,488
Tommy, please!

388
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:14,204
Ruth, why would you
date a psychopath like that?

389
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,807
Better than fishing
for turds.

390
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,612
So, who unlocked it?

391
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:21,723
Who cares?
Let's just get out of here.

392
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,774
- Nice Pierrot costume.
- Thank you.

393
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:26,142
See?

394
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,246
Well, that was fun.

395
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:36,798
Shit!

396
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:44,859
I'm really sorry
about all of this.

397
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:46,876
- Why did he do this?
- This is low,

398
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:48,538
even for Tommy,

399
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,660
like "farting
in my milk carton

400
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,165
"and making me drink it"
kind-of-low.

401
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,958
It was the fifth grade.

402
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,546
It was ninth.

403
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,883
I can try and scrounge up
something to help.

404
00:23:57,885 --> 00:23:59,294
I got it. It's fine,
thank you, though.

405
00:24:00,764 --> 00:24:02,779
I'll just stay here
until the morning.

406
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:03,934
Get it into a shop.

407
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:07,771
We have a sofa
in the basement.

408
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:09,405
You're welcome to use it.

409
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:15,389
Hey, look, I really
don't want any trouble.

410
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,525
We'll just have to be gone
before Dad gets up.

411
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,853
<i>An AM/FM stereo
table radio with auto...</i>

412
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,073
Sam's pet turns out
to be a sewer rat?

413
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,482
You've got some demons.

414
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:56,828
It's not finished yet.

415
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,818
I used to love these as a kid.
You collect them?

416
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,965
Oh, I've read
every single issue.

417
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:13,885
Cover to cover.

418
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:18,617
You know, if you're serious
about being a writer,

419
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,931
you can't do it here.

420
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,620
You gotta move to the city.

421
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:27,484
I couldn't leave my dad.

422
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:40,249
Uh, the, uh...

423
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,788
basement is downstairs.

424
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,307
Yeah, that's usually
where they are.

425
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:26,614
Tommy Milner.

426
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:29,367
It's late!
Are you drunk again?

427
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:30,615
It's Halloween.

428
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:33,049
You were supposed to
deliver eggs to the Wolvertons.

429
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,214
Now?

430
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:37,752
Now!

431
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:47,734
What?

432
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:50,870
This is bullshit.

433
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:07,797
"Tommy hated
that scarecrow all his life.

434
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,647
"He took the eggs
and left for the last time."

435
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,175
Tommy...

436
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:50,260
Eat shit, Harold.

437
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:52,500
Mom!

438
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:36,881
Mom!

439
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,724
Help me!

440
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:43,059
Mom!

441
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:25,840
Oh, my God.

442
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:28,944
Will you look at this?

443
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,699
I thought you were going to
be on your way, stranger?

444
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:33,426
I'm trying.

445
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,303
Whew.

446
00:32:36,305 --> 00:32:38,448
You know, no one's seen
this high school kid

447
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,656
named Tommy Milner
since last night.

448
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,991
Witnesses say
he got into a fight

449
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,624
at the drive-in.

450
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:46,832
Milner didn't do this
to your car,

451
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,986
did he?

452
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:52,818
I never got your name.

453
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:56,403
Ramon.

454
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:58,930
Rodriguez.

455
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,151
Look, I think
it'd be a good idea

456
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:05,648
if you stuck around
for a few days.

457
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,282
<i>Comprende?</i>

458
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:10,257
Rodriguez.

459
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,094
It wasn't there before.

460
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,630
The red ink was wet.

461
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:22,863
And it did feel like blood.
It was thicker than ink.

462
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:25,166
How could you
eat that?

463
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:27,377
Do you know how many body
parts are in there? Seven!

464
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:30,415
I read it in a magazine.

465
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,975
Cool. He turns into
a scarecrow?

466
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,317
Fresh twist.

467
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,206
That's not a twist.

468
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:39,022
I told you,
the story, it...

469
00:33:39,024 --> 00:33:41,487
Uh, it just appeared.

470
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,538
Tommy didn't even
show up to school.

471
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:46,926
It's like he just disappeared.

472
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:49,328
Everyone knew he was eager
to go shoot some commies.

473
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:54,384
Maybe he just, I don't
know, left early?

474
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:56,846
There was that room...

475
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:58,094
Just drop it.

476
00:33:58,096 --> 00:33:59,312
Nah, tell me.

477
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,630
In the house,
when I was hiding,

478
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:05,805
the room was old.
I mean new. Perfect,

479
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,470
like when they lived there,
and I saw this...

480
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:08,686
this old lady and this dog

481
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:10,286
and they were just
staring at me

482
00:34:10,288 --> 00:34:11,917
- with this look...
- Listen to yourselves.

483
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,901
Nothing happened to us
in that house

484
00:34:13,903 --> 00:34:15,217
except for
what Tommy did to us.

485
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:17,230
If he's gone,

486
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:18,224
good riddance.

487
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:20,910
We should never
have gone there,

488
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:22,412
we should never
have taken the book.

489
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:24,272
You let a ghost story
get into your heads.

490
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,768
That's all it is.

491
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:29,805
I'm worried.

492
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,150
Tommy wasn't at school.

493
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,559
His name was in the book.

494
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,549
I mean, there's no way it's
actually connected, right?

495
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,404
Yeah, of course it's not.

496
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:45,487
Stella, I can't get
mixed up with the police.

497
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:48,079
I have to see it.

498
00:35:12,078 --> 00:35:14,254
It's what Tommy
was wearing last night.

499
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:16,942
Okay, what if this is Tommy,

500
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:19,467
and what happens in the book

501
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:20,717
is exactly
what's happened for real?

502
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,860
Stop trying to scare me.

503
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:24,399
It's just a scarecrow.

504
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:33,131
- Did you hear about Tommy?
- He's missing.

505
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,342
Here's your book back.

506
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:33,902
You're home late.

507
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:36,653
Picked up another shift?

508
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:38,509
You have to?

509
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:40,973
Can't say no.

510
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:44,621
There's food in the fridge.

511
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,900
Did you always
work this much?

512
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:52,909
Even when Mom was here?

513
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:58,412
Heard the Milner boy
didn't come home.

514
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,634
Eh, everybody's been talking
about it.

515
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:09,773
Please just come straight
home next few days, okay?

516
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:12,012
Yep.

517
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:21,004
Ow.

518
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:26,698
You got enough zit paint
on there?

519
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,098
It's a spider bite,
you butt-pimple.

520
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,281
A spider...

521
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:32,076
Ah, damn it, my banana!

522
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,115
I thought
you were leaving?

523
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,017
Hope you're hungry.

524
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,616
Oh, I'm starving. Thanks.

525
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:50,153
You know,
I can't stop thinking

526
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:51,369
about Tommy's disappearance.

527
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:53,131
There has to be some...

528
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:57,964
Where did you get that?

529
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:02,216
It was just here
on your bookshelf.

530
00:38:02,218 --> 00:38:04,969
No, I... I was just here.
It wasn't.

531
00:38:04,971 --> 00:38:06,441
I took this back
to the house.

532
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:07,435
What?

533
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:13,354
How is it getting...
How is it back here again?

534
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,376
- What's happening?
- What the hell!

535
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:24,265
How does that work?

536
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:25,931
But we've got
to make it stop!

537
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:34,791
"A mother was digging
at the edge of the garden

538
00:38:34,793 --> 00:38:36,520
"when she saw a big toe.
'It looks nice and plump, '

539
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,631
"she said,
'I'll put it in the stew...'"

540
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:39,656
What kind of story is that?

541
00:38:39,658 --> 00:38:40,619
What...

542
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:43,882
Auggie.

543
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,722
Auggie!

544
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:50,120
<i>Pick up!</i>

545
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,175
<i>Auggie!</i>

546
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:52,872
No, there's nothing here.

547
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,103
I told you, I mean,
the least you could have done

548
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:57,830
was go to the store
before you and Jeff took off

549
00:38:57,832 --> 00:38:59,432
for the weekend.

550
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,354
No, I'm not
gonna call him "Dad."

551
00:39:06,185 --> 00:39:07,850
Okay, I'm eating the stew.

552
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,473
The stew in the fridge?

553
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,862
Yeah, well someone made it.

554
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:15,722
Okay, I'll see you
when you get back. Love you.

555
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:20,074
<i>Auggie, pick up!</i>

556
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:26,120
Hey, I'm eating.

557
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:27,367
<i>Auggie!</i>

558
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:28,519
Stella!

559
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,566
Auggie, do not eat anything.

560
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,070
<i>Listen,
you're in the next story!</i>

561
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,825
<i>Whatever you do,
do not eat anything!</i>

562
00:39:38,952 --> 00:39:40,201
Har-har. Very funny.

563
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:42,663
Did Chuck put you up to this?

564
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:44,583
Auggie, this isn't a joke.

565
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:46,311
Okay, the story
is writing itself right now.

566
00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:48,774
I don't know how or why,
but I'm reading it right here.

567
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:50,373
<i>"A sound scared him.
It was a voice.</i>

568
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,426
"And it called out,
'Who took my toe?'"

569
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:59,845
<i>It's a corpse
looking for her missing toe.</i>

570
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:02,117
Yeah, I know this story.

571
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,069
<i>My dad used to tell me
this story.</i>

572
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:05,926
<i>It scared me so much
as a kid, but...</i>

573
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:07,590
Am I not supposed to wait
for someone to say that

574
00:40:07,592 --> 00:40:09,701
'cause I don't hear anything.

575
00:40:09,703 --> 00:40:11,493
Listen, we're reading it
right here.

576
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:13,670
<i>"And then
the voice grew louder:</i>

577
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:16,265
<i>"'Who took my toe?'"</i>

578
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:18,984
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

579
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,069
There's no voice.

580
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:26,597
Yeah, well,
there has to be a voice.

581
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,519
You're the only one
saying it.

582
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:33,609
<i>Auggie!</i>

583
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:35,815
<i>Auggie!</i>

584
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,016
<i>Oh, no, Auggie, pick up.</i>

585
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,151
<i>Auggie, don't eat anything.</i>

586
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,692
<i>Auggie!</i>

587
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:55,717
Oh, God!

588
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,800
<i>Auggie. Auggie?</i>

589
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:06,183
<i>Auggie?
Come on, Auggie, pick up!</i>

590
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:10,149
Did you hear that?

591
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,815
Hear what?
I don't hear anything.

592
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:16,070
There was a toe
in the stew. A freaking toe.

593
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:22,435
What does the book say
happens next?

594
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:25,316
<i>"August got very scared.</i>

595
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,269
<i>"But he thought,
'It doesn't know where I am.</i>

596
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:28,615
<i>"'It'll never find me...'"</i>

597
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:32,229
How does the book know that?

598
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:34,247
And then he heard
the voice again...

599
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:39,622
Who...

600
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,095
took...

601
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:43,651
my...

602
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:44,646
Toe.

603
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,070
<i>Auggie, just get out
of the house!</i>

604
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:02,054
He's only
a couple of blocks away!

605
00:42:34,437 --> 00:42:35,781
Who...

606
00:42:37,412 --> 00:42:38,757
took...

607
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,085
my...

608
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:45,250
toe?

609
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:51,781
Come on, come on.

610
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:30,595
Auggie?

611
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:32,611
Auggie!

612
00:44:34,914 --> 00:44:36,131
Auggie!

613
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:52,608
Tommy! Tommy Milner!

614
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,567
<i>And as if this year</i>

615
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:55,744
<i>hasn't been
grim enough already,</i>

616
00:44:55,746 --> 00:44:58,463
<i>we have a disappearance
on our hands, friends.</i>

617
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:00,255
<i>Our own Tommy Milner,</i>

618
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:02,561
<i>right here,
in little Mill Valley.</i>

619
00:45:10,913 --> 00:45:12,991
I was the one
that found the book.

620
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:14,687
I took it home.

621
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:16,097
This is not your fault.

622
00:45:18,144 --> 00:45:20,640
You know,

623
00:45:20,642 --> 00:45:22,464
I caused

624
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:24,543
every single bad thing
that happened in my life.

625
00:45:26,818 --> 00:45:28,353
My mom leaving.

626
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:31,265
And now Auggie.

627
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,366
None of that is true.

628
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:43,102
Sorry we're late.
Ruth ran out of zit paint.

629
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:45,311
I swear, if you weren't
so stressful to deal with

630
00:45:45,313 --> 00:45:46,846
in the first place,
I wouldn't have zits.

631
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:48,736
What's so urgent?

632
00:45:49,856 --> 00:45:51,042
Where's Auggie?

633
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:53,086
Auggie's gone.

634
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:54,368
Another story
was written.

635
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,896
Right in front of our eyes.

636
00:45:58,016 --> 00:45:59,201
I don't get it.

637
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,666
What is this?

638
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,057
This is a stale joke.

639
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:07,613
Halloween's over.

640
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,769
Where the hell is Auggie?

641
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,318
We don't know.

642
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,390
His parents are traveling,
and he's just gone.

643
00:46:15,392 --> 00:46:16,445
What do you mean
you don't know?

644
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:17,343
Okay, well, then
let's find him!

645
00:46:17,345 --> 00:46:18,849
I don't think
he's coming back.

646
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:21,533
First...

647
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:23,102
I knew
something happened.

648
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:24,766
- ...Tommy disappeared.
- Saw that old lady...

649
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:25,953
And then now Auggie.

650
00:46:28,255 --> 00:46:31,454
They had their stories
in the book,

651
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,952
and it happens every night.

652
00:46:34,816 --> 00:46:36,512
Jesus, he ate a toe?

653
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:41,056
You don't read the book.

654
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,584
The book reads you.

655
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:50,621
I'm afraid that we woke
something up.

656
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,703
That the same thing is going
to happen to all of us.

657
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,792
We were all in that house.

658
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,183
No, this isn't real, okay?

659
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:04,220
Stories can't hurt you.

660
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,524
Sarah Bellows is a myth,

661
00:47:06,526 --> 00:47:08,895
and even if she's not,
she's dead.

662
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:11,452
We need to go to the police.

663
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:12,669
No, we can't.

664
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:14,716
They know what Tommy did
to Ramon's car

665
00:47:14,718 --> 00:47:15,740
and they think
that he had...

666
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:17,469
Auggie!
We need to find Auggie.

667
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:18,720
Not going to the police.

668
00:47:19,806 --> 00:47:21,599
They'll never believe
a word I say.

669
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:23,804
Well, then
we'll make them believe.

670
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:26,493
By the time that they
make sense of everything,

671
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:27,740
we're all going
to be dead.

672
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:29,372
No, no, no.

673
00:47:29,374 --> 00:47:33,340
If... If we can't go to
the police, what do we do?

674
00:47:33,342 --> 00:47:35,678
Just sit and wait for
our story to be written?

675
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:39,228
There's gotta be some way
to stop a witch.

676
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,147
Well, I don't believe
any of it.

677
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,611
I gotta go.
My musical's tonight,

678
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:44,923
and I'm not falling
for another one

679
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:46,332
of your dumb
Halloween pranks.

680
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:47,387
It's not a prank, Ruth.

681
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:48,284
Ruth, please,
don't go.

682
00:47:48,286 --> 00:47:49,532
I know you want to be
a writer, Stella,

683
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:50,588
- but this prank is sick.
- No!

684
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,703
Ruthie! Ruthie, stop.

685
00:47:55,325 --> 00:47:56,798
<i>Do you really think
this is going to work?</i>

686
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,647
It worked in Salem.

687
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,522
Why?
Why won't you burn?

688
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,699
I hate you! I hate you.
I hate you. God damn it!

689
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,107
This is... This is why
I don't read books!

690
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:27,803
We know
we can't burn or destroy it,

691
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:30,749
but how much do we actually
know about Sarah Bellows?

692
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:09,946
Listen to this one:

693
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,321
"After Sarah hung herself,

694
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,810
"the Bellows family
fired Sylvie Baptiste

695
00:49:14,812 --> 00:49:16,153
"as she and her daughter,
Lou Lou,

696
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:17,722
"were thought
to be responsible

697
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:19,802
"for teaching her
black magic."

698
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:21,917
If it's in the paper,
it has to be true, right?

699
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,730
Is there a picture of Sarah?

700
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:26,618
No, just her name.

701
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,529
But, uh, I did find an ad
for brain salt,

702
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:32,154
cures headaches
and constipation.

703
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:33,245
Not sure
why it didn't take off.

704
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,701
Auggie, Auggie would have
loved that.

705
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:42,202
My eyes are literally
gonna start bleeding,

706
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:43,868
and we still have nothing
on Sarah.

707
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:46,684
What year
did she hang herself?

708
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:48,604
Uh...

709
00:49:50,523 --> 00:49:51,516
1898.

710
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,641
In just one year,
all her family members left.

711
00:49:55,643 --> 00:49:57,178
What do you expect?

712
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,520
I mean, who wants to
stick around with the name

713
00:49:58,522 --> 00:50:00,249
that's synonymous
with murdering kids?

714
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:01,273
Not stick around,

715
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:02,808
I mean gone.

716
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,188
Like, off the face
of the earth.

717
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,016
Take the father, Deodat.

718
00:50:09,018 --> 00:50:10,585
The cat owned a paper mill

719
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,401
and yet he leaves it
without ever selling it?

720
00:50:13,403 --> 00:50:14,681
No stories
written about him,

721
00:50:14,683 --> 00:50:16,668
not even a letter,
just disappears.

722
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:19,258
Deodat...

723
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,018
Deodat.

724
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:23,323
I've seen that name.

725
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:35,163
"Deodat was a wealthy man
who wanted to go hunting."

726
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,839
Give me another name.

727
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:42,297
Uh... One of
their sons, Ephraim.

728
00:50:42,299 --> 00:50:43,511
Ephraim Bellows.

729
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:44,474
Ephraim Bellows.

730
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,235
They didn't just leave
the town.

731
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,595
They each have a story.

732
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:55,578
Why?

733
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,312
Oh, my God.

734
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,591
Oh, my God,
it's happening again.

735
00:51:05,593 --> 00:51:06,971
She's writing another story.

736
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,905
"The Red Spot"?

737
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:19,545
Why are you looking at me?

738
00:51:20,442 --> 00:51:21,530
What?

739
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,592
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, it's me?

740
00:51:25,594 --> 00:51:27,256
It... I'm gonna die?

741
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:29,047
I don't want to die!
I even haven't had sex yet.

742
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:30,454
"One night,
a spider crawled across

743
00:51:30,456 --> 00:51:31,575
"a young girl's cheek
and bit her."

744
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:34,071
Spider?
I was the spider man! I'm...

745
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:35,673
Wait, "young girl"?

746
00:51:37,785 --> 00:51:39,094
"Went to the restroom."

747
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,919
It's not you.
It's your sister.

748
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:41,881
Ruthie?

749
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:54,230
<i>Performers
to stage in 20 minutes.</i>

750
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:12,406
Oh, honey, you need to do
something about that.

751
00:52:13,879 --> 00:52:15,193
Yeah.

752
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:15,672
It's a different bathroom.

753
00:53:17,206 --> 00:53:18,807
- Second floor!
- Okay.

754
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:26,392
<i>Ruth.</i>

755
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:52,471
Move. Out of the way!

756
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,899
Ruth!

757
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:22,965
Oh, my God, Ruth!

758
00:54:24,437 --> 00:54:26,738
Help me, help me!

759
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,828
Ruth, I got you.

760
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,044
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you.

761
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:30,964
Help me, help me.
Get them off!

762
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:32,915
Get them off!

763
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:35,474
Ruth, it's okay.
It's okay. I got you.

764
00:54:35,476 --> 00:54:38,165
- Get them off!
- You're going to be okay, all right? It's okay.

765
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:42,966
Move, move, move!

766
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:48,853
You're okay.
You're okay, you're okay, Ruthie.

767
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:51,157
Help! Somebody,
get help, now!

768
00:54:58,932 --> 00:55:00,337
You're okay, Ruthie,
you're okay.

769
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,161
- It's all finished.
- Get them off, get them off.

770
00:55:02,163 --> 00:55:03,730
They're all gone, Ruthie.
They're all gone.

771
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:05,619
Get them off me.
Get them off. Get them off me.

772
00:55:05,621 --> 00:55:07,282
- Get them off me!
- Ruthie, they're all gone,

773
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:09,074
they're all gone,
they're all gone, okay?

774
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:10,869
- Get them off me.
- You're okay.

775
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:12,245
Get them off me.

776
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:23,733
It's intense.
I hope she's okay.

777
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:26,803
I saw her. Sarah was there.

778
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:29,012
She was controlling
the entire thing.

779
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,029
My sister's gone.

780
00:55:31,572 --> 00:55:32,820
We're next.

781
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,188
We're next.

782
00:55:42,036 --> 00:55:43,027
You find it?

783
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:47,253
Louise Baptiste...

784
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:49,396
Lou Lou?

785
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:51,667
220 Goldshire Road.

786
00:55:55,283 --> 00:55:57,553
I had this
messed-up dream again.

787
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:59,409
I was trapped
in the red room.

788
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:03,828
And there's that fat,
pale lady who keeps whispering,

789
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:06,769
"This is an evil place.

790
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:08,499
"Run away
while you still can."

791
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:13,747
I'm scared the witch
is going to use it against me.

792
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:19,536
Hello.

793
00:56:19,538 --> 00:56:22,034
Uh, does Lou Lou Baptiste
live here still?

794
00:56:23,218 --> 00:56:24,401
<i>"I don't want
to bomb anybody</i>

795
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:27,632
<i>"if it's not necessary
to save..."</i>

796
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,513
Tricky Dicky. That's no name
for a president.

797
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:32,658
Mama, you got company!

798
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,890
Lou Lou,
can you hear us?

799
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:32,977
You may be the next.

800
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:36,017
Why do you say that?

801
00:57:37,714 --> 00:57:39,634
Why, that's the song, girl.

802
00:57:41,072 --> 00:57:45,647
<i>♪ Don't ever laugh
as a hearse goes by</i>

803
00:57:45,649 --> 00:57:47,759
<i>♪ For you may be</i>

804
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:49,745
<i>♪ The next to die ♪</i>

805
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,097
Sarah loved that song.

806
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:00,689
We have her book.

807
00:58:05,073 --> 00:58:07,344
You found her book?
Give it here.

808
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:22,673
I give her this.

809
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,221
I feel so sorry
for that girl,

810
00:58:26,223 --> 00:58:30,097
sitting down there in the
darkness all by herself.

811
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,759
Did your mom
ever teach her anything?

812
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:38,448
Teach her?

813
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:40,336
Black magic?

814
00:58:42,415 --> 00:58:43,629
No.

815
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:45,871
There is no magic, child.

816
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,104
There is only rage.

817
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:52,848
Then how is she still
writing the stories?

818
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:56,912
Stories hurt.

819
00:58:58,352 --> 00:58:59,536
Stories heal.

820
00:59:00,782 --> 00:59:03,212
Do you know
what you have done?

821
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:04,588
Done what?

822
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,959
You shouldn't have taken
the book.

823
00:59:09,102 --> 00:59:11,023
You made her angry.

824
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:18,988
"The worms crawl in,
the worms crawl out..."

825
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,429
She gets
this way sometimes.

826
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,645
Look, I need to know.

827
00:59:21,647 --> 00:59:23,597
Another time.
I need to settle her down.

828
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,740
No, we need to know.
I need to know.

829
00:59:25,742 --> 00:59:26,860
She told the doctors
everything she knew

830
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:29,356
at the hospital where that
disturbed girl hung herself.

831
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:30,413
But I... I thought...

832
00:59:30,415 --> 00:59:32,108
Everyone always said Sarah
hanged herself in the house.

833
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,836
You weren't there.
Mama was.

834
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:36,653
The hospitals have records.

835
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:37,931
Records of Sarah.

836
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:40,686
Then what are we still
doing here? Let's go.

837
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:44,811
<i>It's election day, folks,</i>

838
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:47,244
<i>so let your voice be heard.</i>

839
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:51,372
<i>Say no to the war!
Say no to Vietnam.</i>

840
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:55,375
<i>Say no to sending
our children to die.</i>

841
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:27,693
Excuse me.

842
01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:32,398
We need to see the records
of a former patient.

843
01:00:33,453 --> 01:00:35,213
We don't give out
patient records.

844
01:00:38,157 --> 01:00:39,627
Well, uh,

845
01:00:39,629 --> 01:00:41,098
I mean,

846
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,469
she died
about 100 years ago.

847
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:46,507
I'm sure she or anybody else

848
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,290
probably doesn't care,
you know.

849
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:51,307
Why do you kids wanna look
at old patient files for?

850
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:53,611
Uh, for a school assignment

851
01:00:53,613 --> 01:00:54,638
on, uh...

852
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:59,435
psychological human studies.

853
01:00:59,437 --> 01:01:00,750
Yes, the studies.

854
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:02,349
Mmm-hmm.

855
01:01:04,012 --> 01:01:05,194
I think
they put the files

856
01:01:05,196 --> 01:01:06,476
from the old hospital
in the red room.

857
01:01:08,107 --> 01:01:09,132
Red room?

858
01:01:10,413 --> 01:01:12,170
Six weeks
processing time.

859
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:13,293
At most.

860
01:01:14,284 --> 01:01:15,500
Need a pen?

861
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:21,901
So much for that.

862
01:01:26,124 --> 01:01:27,146
Come on!

863
01:01:27,148 --> 01:01:28,492
No.

864
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:46,889
We are not going
to the red room!

865
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:48,362
No, we are going
to the red room.

866
01:01:48,364 --> 01:01:49,418
- No, I'm not.
- Yes.

867
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,540
No. I'm not doing it.

868
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,082
<i>Dr. Kaufmann
to telephone, please.</i>

869
01:01:55,084 --> 01:01:57,002
<i>Dr. Kaufmann.</i>

870
01:01:57,004 --> 01:02:00,588
I told you about my dream.
I don't want to go.

871
01:02:01,707 --> 01:02:03,947
So, it isn't actually red.
You're fine.

872
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,033
It is called
the red room, okay?

873
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:11,147
Who said it had to be red?

874
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:14,089
Uh-uh. Count me out.

875
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:16,011
Okay. Just... stay here.

876
01:02:17,963 --> 01:02:19,980
Be quick. It'll be fine.

877
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,787
Just don't get caught.

878
01:03:05,386 --> 01:03:06,312
George Foreman.

879
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:08,967
He's going to be
the world champion in '73.

880
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:10,890
Hey, you know
where you're going?

881
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,578
Oh, God. Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

882
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,894
Hey, you there.

883
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:23,496
You're not supposed
to be here.

884
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:24,842
Hey! Stop!

885
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:35,946
The R.E.D. room.

886
01:04:00,808 --> 01:04:03,207
Admittance records,
psychological exams,

887
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:04,807
what she ate...

888
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:06,986
This is... everything.

889
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:09,704
She was admitted
by her own family.

890
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:14,405
Says here
that she was suffering

891
01:04:14,407 --> 01:04:16,967
from achromasia-albinism.

892
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:19,208
They put her in her basement
because she was different.

893
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:26,568
Here, her supervising
doctor was...

894
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:29,449
Dr. Ephraim Bellows.

895
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:31,719
Her own brother?

896
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:32,712
Yeah.

897
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:39,526
Jesus! They tortured her.

898
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:40,998
Look, electroshock,

899
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,270
isolation therapy,

900
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:45,704
lateral cerebral
diathermia treatment.

901
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:49,160
What about this thing?

902
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:56,392
What is this?

903
01:04:59,367 --> 01:05:00,776
I've seen
one of these before.

904
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:03,433
It's a wax cylinder.

905
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,695
They used them to make
recordings before LPs.

906
01:05:14,086 --> 01:05:16,903
So, does that mean we're going
to get to hear Sarah?

907
01:05:24,327 --> 01:05:26,308
He went this way.

908
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,399
Sound the alarm!

909
01:05:32,551 --> 01:05:35,397
<i>You're
going to tell the truth now.</i>

910
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,063
<i>Aren't you, Sarah?</i>

911
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:45,799
<i>I didn't hurt the children.</i>

912
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,446
<i>I didn't.</i>

913
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:52,709
<i>Ephraim...</i>

914
01:05:52,711 --> 01:05:56,931
<i>That isn't the truth, is it?</i>

915
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:59,332
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

916
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:00,803
<i>I didn't hurt...</i>

917
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:06,628
<i>Tell the truth, Sarah.</i>

918
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,355
<i>I'm your sister...</i>

919
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:09,763
<i>You poisoned
those children.</i>

920
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:11,782
<i>No. No.</i>

921
01:06:12,517 --> 01:06:14,054
<i>I tried...</i>

922
01:06:14,726 --> 01:06:16,903
<i>I tried to save them.</i>

923
01:06:18,661 --> 01:06:21,892
<i>But nobody listened.</i>

924
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:26,275
<i>I didn't want them hurt,
but you wouldn't let me out.</i>

925
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:27,651
<i>Sarah...</i>

926
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,818
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

927
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,326
She doesn't know
what she did.

928
01:06:37,189 --> 01:06:38,403
<i>It was the water.</i>

929
01:06:38,405 --> 01:06:40,292
<i>We went over this, Sarah.</i>

930
01:06:40,294 --> 01:06:41,955
<i>The water.</i>

931
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:45,219
<i>There's nothing wrong
with the water.</i>

932
01:06:45,221 --> 01:06:46,882
<i>That's why you're here.</i>

933
01:06:46,884 --> 01:06:48,226
<i>The mill.</i>

934
01:06:48,228 --> 01:06:50,946
<i>It was the mercury
from the mill.</i>

935
01:06:50,948 --> 01:06:52,610
<i>You poisoned the wa...</i>

936
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,806
She didn't do it.

937
01:06:57,509 --> 01:06:58,470
It was her family.

938
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:03,077
<i>Sarah,</i>

939
01:07:03,748 --> 01:07:05,285
<i>are you still here?</i>

940
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:10,308
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

941
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,830
<i>I'll tell you
what you want to hear.</i>

942
01:07:14,724 --> 01:07:16,197
<i>And what's that?</i>

943
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:27,972
<i>Charlie had a dream
of a red room...</i>

944
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:31,202
<i>Charlie?</i>

945
01:07:31,204 --> 01:07:32,225
The R.E.D. room.

946
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:33,700
<i>Charlie who?</i>

947
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:35,301
Chuck.

948
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:37,637
<i>In his dream,</i>

949
01:07:38,692 --> 01:07:41,922
<i>a woman with a pale face,</i>

950
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,098
<i>black eyes,</i>

951
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,849
<i>and long black hair</i>

952
01:07:46,851 --> 01:07:50,498
<i>slipped silently
into his room.</i>

953
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,697
<i>She leaned over and whispered,</i>

954
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:58,242
<i>"This is an evil place.</i>

955
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:01,282
<i>"Run away
while you still can."</i>

956
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,376
That's not good.

957
01:08:17,378 --> 01:08:18,403
Chuck!

958
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:29,027
Help!

959
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,507
Help! Somebody, help!

960
01:09:18,817 --> 01:09:20,769
Help! Please, somebody, help.

961
01:09:57,408 --> 01:09:58,879
Help. Help!

962
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:00,862
Somebody, help!

963
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:02,209
Come on!

964
01:10:53,184 --> 01:10:55,678
Chuck! Chuck,
where are you?

965
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,641
Chuck!

966
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,326
Where is he?

967
01:10:59,328 --> 01:11:00,572
He should be right here.

968
01:11:00,574 --> 01:11:02,718
Chuck? Chuck?

969
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,887
Chuck.

970
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,389
So,

971
01:11:19,391 --> 01:11:20,736
where's your
little friend?

972
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,760
<i>News coverage of
election night '68 continues.</i>

973
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:29,180
Stella?

974
01:11:29,182 --> 01:11:30,525
<i>Dad.</i>

975
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:31,904
Are you okay? Where are you?

976
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:34,141
<i>Stella?</i>

977
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,125
I'm
afraid I'm gonna die, Dad.

978
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:38,172
<i>Aw, sweetie, don't say that.</i>

979
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:40,252
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell me what I can do.

980
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,652
<i>Can't do anything about it.</i>

981
01:11:42,654 --> 01:11:44,637
<i>I can't do anything about it.</i>

982
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,484
No, no. You gotta help me
out here, sweetie.

983
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:50,108
<i>Tell me where you are.
I will get there right away.</i>

984
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:52,093
<i>I don't care what you're going
through, just tell me, please.</i>

985
01:11:52,095 --> 01:11:53,340
If I go missing...

986
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,430
<i>Missing?</i>

987
01:11:55,326 --> 01:11:56,767
If you can't find me...

988
01:11:57,342 --> 01:11:58,334
Find you where?

989
01:12:00,638 --> 01:12:01,788
<i>Stella?</i>

990
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:03,739
I didn't leave you.

991
01:12:03,741 --> 01:12:05,756
<i>I would never
do that to you.</i>

992
01:12:05,758 --> 01:12:06,908
I don't understand

993
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,316
<i>what you're talking about,
Stella, leave me?</i>

994
01:12:08,318 --> 01:12:09,468
<i>Why would you leave me?</i>

995
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:11,230
Is someone there
with you? Do...

996
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,430
<i>Please just listen to me,
sweetie.</i>

997
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,405
It's not your fault, Stella.

998
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,062
<i>It's not your fault she left.</i>

999
01:12:25,693 --> 01:12:28,122
Everyone said
it was because of me.

1000
01:12:28,124 --> 01:12:31,355
Oh, no, please, please,
please listen to me.

1001
01:12:31,357 --> 01:12:33,756
<i>It's not your fault she left.</i>

1002
01:12:33,758 --> 01:12:37,790
<i>It was never, ever about you.
It was about her.</i>

1003
01:12:40,445 --> 01:12:43,325
<i>I don't know, somewhere deep
down inside, she just...</i>

1004
01:12:44,381 --> 01:12:46,717
<i>felt trapped or something,
I don't know, I...</i>

1005
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,762
It's complicated.

1006
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,299
I wish I had answers
for you, sweetie,

1007
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:52,477
<i>but I just don't
and I'm so sorry.</i>

1008
01:12:55,677 --> 01:12:58,236
I love you, Dad.
I gotta go.

1009
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:00,507
It's not your fault, Stella.
Please don't hang up, sweetie.

1010
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:01,499
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I gotta go.

1011
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:02,365
<i>I'm telling you,
it wasn't your...</i>

1012
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,358
So? Is your dad going to come
pick you up?

1013
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:12,796
Oh, Stella,
what's going on?

1014
01:13:14,076 --> 01:13:16,125
I need answers from you
right now.

1015
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,522
Understand?

1016
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:21,659
<i>Richard Nixon is still holding
at 43 and Humphrey 35,</i>

1017
01:13:21,661 --> 01:13:23,899
<i>but, uh, Wallace
has come up one point.</i>

1018
01:13:23,901 --> 01:13:25,499
What about my call?

1019
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:28,188
Rules don't apply
to draft dodgers.

1020
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:30,460
You think
I wouldn't find out?

1021
01:13:31,611 --> 01:13:34,490
Ramon Morales.

1022
01:13:34,492 --> 01:13:36,281
You're gonna do your duty
to this country

1023
01:13:36,283 --> 01:13:37,849
one way or the other.

1024
01:13:37,851 --> 01:13:40,762
I can help you if you tell us
about your missing friends.

1025
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:42,714
Told you everything we know.

1026
01:13:42,716 --> 01:13:43,804
Oh, yeah, right.

1027
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:47,258
Sarah Bellows' book.

1028
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:51,196
The stories write themselves
and it all comes alive.

1029
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:54,076
We can't find any bodies.

1030
01:13:54,876 --> 01:13:56,028
Yeah, I know.

1031
01:13:57,244 --> 01:13:58,364
It's hard to believe.

1032
01:13:59,452 --> 01:14:01,593
We saved Ruth at school.

1033
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:03,549
I mean, we stopped her
from getting killed.

1034
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:07,098
Ruth Steinberg?

1035
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,668
That's who
you're talking about?

1036
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:10,841
You didn't save anyone.

1037
01:14:10,843 --> 01:14:13,787
She's stuck in the nuthouse
for the rest of her life.

1038
01:14:15,098 --> 01:14:17,945
Get out of here, Stella.
You're free to go.

1039
01:14:17,947 --> 01:14:20,444
You're so much better
than this draft dodger.

1040
01:14:21,434 --> 01:14:23,355
Come on,
what would your father say?

1041
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:26,204
I'm not leaving.

1042
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,489
Since you're not
going to 'Nam,

1043
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:33,404
maybe a night behind bars will
loosen those lips of yours.

1044
01:14:35,451 --> 01:14:37,816
Come on, Hobbs.

1045
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:39,673
Go home,
dig out that 10 bucks

1046
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,105
you're gonna owe me
when Nixon wins,

1047
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,448
and, uh,
I'll close up here.

1048
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:44,537
All right,
have a good night.

1049
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:46,044
Nighty-night, lovebirds.

1050
01:14:47,195 --> 01:14:48,668
I should've told you.

1051
01:14:50,105 --> 01:14:51,641
You must think
I'm a coward, but...

1052
01:14:51,643 --> 01:14:53,116
I would never think that.

1053
01:15:01,403 --> 01:15:04,539
Two months ago they shipped
my brother back from Vietnam

1054
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:06,938
in pieces.

1055
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:09,146
I'm so sorry.

1056
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:14,682
Last week when I got
my draft notice,

1057
01:15:17,049 --> 01:15:18,011
I couldn't.

1058
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,314
They just send you there
to die.

1059
01:15:21,913 --> 01:15:23,193
If the book reads me,

1060
01:15:25,178 --> 01:15:26,682
I'm afraid
what it's going to say.

1061
01:15:52,985 --> 01:15:54,646
There you go, boy.

1062
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:56,058
Yeah, that's good, huh?

1063
01:16:04,057 --> 01:16:06,522
"Me Tie Dough-ty Walker"?

1064
01:16:17,017 --> 01:16:19,450
Who came up
with all this sick stuff?

1065
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,233
Is this you, Stella?

1066
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:25,910
We didn't write the stories.

1067
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:02,456
Trigger?

1068
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:06,553
Wait, is there another story?

1069
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:08,948
Please, you have to
let us out!

1070
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:09,974
Okay, if there's
another story,

1071
01:17:09,976 --> 01:17:11,704
we are all
gonna be in danger.

1072
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:16,084
Tell us
what's happening!

1073
01:17:16,086 --> 01:17:17,685
What's the story?

1074
01:17:22,358 --> 01:17:23,637
Please just listen
to me, okay?

1075
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,654
We're all going to die.

1076
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:41,684
It's my turn.

1077
01:17:41,686 --> 01:17:44,405
Okay,
what happens in the story?

1078
01:17:44,407 --> 01:17:46,231
Just tell me
which name is in the book.

1079
01:17:47,639 --> 01:17:48,758
Ramon.

1080
01:17:59,094 --> 01:18:01,108
It's a campfire story.

1081
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,231
It used to scare me
to death.

1082
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:08,948
The Jangly Man is coming.

1083
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:09,973
He's going to take me...

1084
01:18:09,975 --> 01:18:11,443
What's going on?

1085
01:18:11,445 --> 01:18:13,110
He's going to say it.
Listen.

1086
01:18:20,213 --> 01:18:24,115
Me tie dough-ty walker!

1087
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:25,685
Are you shitting me?

1088
01:18:45,942 --> 01:18:48,147
Please, just let us out,
please!

1089
01:19:19,668 --> 01:19:22,805
Me tie dough-ty walker!

1090
01:19:39,764 --> 01:19:41,365
Ramon!

1091
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,873
Ramon.

1092
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:47,538
Oh, my God, Ramon.

1093
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:48,629
Oh, my God, what is that?

1094
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,933
Help. Help, please.
Can someone hear me?

1095
01:20:00,724 --> 01:20:01,969
Keys.

1096
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:02,932
Hurry!

1097
01:20:19,059 --> 01:20:20,116
Coward!

1098
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:24,596
I got the keys.

1099
01:20:26,036 --> 01:20:27,796
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1100
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:32,244
Coward!

1101
01:20:34,419 --> 01:20:36,116
Run! Go, go, go!

1102
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:51,987
What are you waiting for?

1103
01:20:52,787 --> 01:20:54,416
Go to the house.

1104
01:20:54,418 --> 01:20:55,600
Tell her the truth.

1105
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:56,912
That thing will follow me.

1106
01:20:56,914 --> 01:20:58,769
But the stories come true
every time.

1107
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,147
Then you better run fast.

1108
01:21:00,883 --> 01:21:02,675
Stop her
and you'll stop this.

1109
01:22:43,087 --> 01:22:44,462
Sarah!

1110
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,478
Can you hear me?

1111
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,678
God damn you!
You have to stop telling these stories!

1112
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,694
We didn't do anything to you!

1113
01:22:51,696 --> 01:22:54,157
We just want to help you!
We know you're innocent!

1114
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,078
We know
you didn't poison the kids!

1115
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,280
But, please,
you just have to stop telling the stories!

1116
01:23:51,982 --> 01:23:53,356
Stella!

1117
01:23:53,358 --> 01:23:54,895
Where are you?

1118
01:24:00,878 --> 01:24:01,903
No, no, no, no.

1119
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:03,948
Stella.

1120
01:24:11,245 --> 01:24:13,164
Stella!

1121
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:25,295
Hey, Stella!

1122
01:24:29,838 --> 01:24:31,339
She's out
of her room again.

1123
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:33,327
Boys? Sarah's out!

1124
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:35,502
Find her now!

1125
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:37,423
Sarah!

1126
01:24:45,453 --> 01:24:46,797
Sarah!

1127
01:24:49,262 --> 01:24:51,566
You leave that to me, Harold.

1128
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:56,365
Sarah!

1129
01:24:57,932 --> 01:24:59,470
Sarah, where are you?

1130
01:25:06,892 --> 01:25:08,237
Sarah!

1131
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:22,603
I hear her.

1132
01:25:30,637 --> 01:25:32,173
She's here!

1133
01:25:33,869 --> 01:25:35,598
She's in here!

1134
01:25:53,645 --> 01:25:54,797
Sarah!

1135
01:25:57,133 --> 01:25:58,124
Where are you?

1136
01:26:04,588 --> 01:26:05,549
Lou Lou.

1137
01:26:22,154 --> 01:26:23,177
Did you see Sarah?

1138
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:24,264
No, ma'am.

1139
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:25,289
She's lying.

1140
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:28,810
You wouldn't lie,
Lou Lou?

1141
01:26:28,812 --> 01:26:29,833
No, ma'am.

1142
01:26:29,835 --> 01:26:31,049
No, I didn't see Sarah.

1143
01:26:31,051 --> 01:26:33,032
No, Mr. Bellows, please, no!

1144
01:26:33,034 --> 01:26:34,632
Please, no!

1145
01:27:04,042 --> 01:27:05,035
You can't hide from us.

1146
01:27:05,609 --> 01:27:06,632
Got you!

1147
01:27:06,634 --> 01:27:09,032
No! No!

1148
01:27:09,034 --> 01:27:11,112
Help me! Help me!

1149
01:27:11,114 --> 01:27:13,065
- Help me!
- Stella!

1150
01:27:13,067 --> 01:27:15,944
Please! Help me!

1151
01:27:15,946 --> 01:27:17,865
- Please, help me!
- She's been telling everyone about the water.

1152
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:18,888
What should
we do with her?

1153
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,232
Somebody, help me, please.

1154
01:27:20,234 --> 01:27:21,512
You're going to shut your ugly mouth
or we're going to shut it for you.

1155
01:27:21,514 --> 01:27:23,559
Please, help me!

1156
01:27:23,561 --> 01:27:26,283
Help me, please!

1157
01:27:30,634 --> 01:27:32,231
Going back
where you belong.

1158
01:27:32,233 --> 01:27:33,992
Help me, please.

1159
01:27:33,994 --> 01:27:35,947
Be quiet
or you know what you'll get.

1160
01:27:37,578 --> 01:27:40,167
Please. I'm not Sarah. Please!

1161
01:27:40,169 --> 01:27:42,411
Please let me go. Please...

1162
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:44,427
Let me go.

1163
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:46,792
Please, don't put me in here.

1164
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,871
Try this again and
we'll send you to the asylum.

1165
01:27:48,873 --> 01:27:51,687
Please. Wait! Please?

1166
01:27:51,689 --> 01:27:53,542
You should have
stayed in your room.

1167
01:27:53,544 --> 01:27:56,008
Please. Please. Please.

1168
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,064
I didn't do it.

1169
01:27:57,066 --> 01:27:58,919
You don't deserve the light.

1170
01:27:58,921 --> 01:28:00,010
No!

1171
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,103
I'm telling you,
I'm telling you,

1172
01:28:04,105 --> 01:28:05,834
I'm not Sarah.

1173
01:28:07,017 --> 01:28:08,071
Please.

1174
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:15,751
Stella...

1175
01:29:30,344 --> 01:29:32,869
I have another story

1176
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:34,215
just for you.

1177
01:29:40,615 --> 01:29:41,640
Stella,

1178
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:46,503
if you can hear me,
wherever you are,

1179
01:29:47,495 --> 01:29:49,384
tell her the truth.

1180
01:29:55,206 --> 01:29:56,006
No.

1181
01:29:58,695 --> 01:30:01,063
It's time that
you hear a story, Sarah.

1182
01:30:05,095 --> 01:30:06,630
You were a victim.

1183
01:30:07,974 --> 01:30:10,470
Now you've turned
into a monster.

1184
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,088
The one that
they said you were.

1185
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:23,751
Stella.

1186
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:26,886
You took my friends.

1187
01:30:28,582 --> 01:30:30,726
Two of the people
that I love most.

1188
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,455
Ramon!

1189
01:30:42,245 --> 01:30:43,363
Stella!

1190
01:30:44,901 --> 01:30:46,374
Are you going
to take him, too?

1191
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:49,543
What your family
did to you,

1192
01:30:50,597 --> 01:30:51,942
what they said,
that's on them.

1193
01:30:53,925 --> 01:30:55,398
But what you do,

1194
01:30:57,733 --> 01:30:59,397
this is on you, Sarah.

1195
01:31:02,789 --> 01:31:04,006
It's all on you.

1196
01:31:12,006 --> 01:31:13,638
I'll tell your story.

1197
01:31:16,068 --> 01:31:18,373
The real story,
I'll tell the truth.

1198
01:31:21,828 --> 01:31:22,821
But the rage,

1199
01:31:23,844 --> 01:31:26,308
the rage has to stop, Sarah.

1200
01:31:46,596 --> 01:31:48,132
Use your blood.

1201
01:32:09,956 --> 01:32:13,154
Sarah Bellows was innocent.

1202
01:32:13,156 --> 01:32:15,237
She knew the truth,

1203
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:18,145
and tried to stop them.

1204
01:32:18,147 --> 01:32:19,108
She was brave.

1205
01:32:19,939 --> 01:32:22,689
She was harmed and destroyed

1206
01:32:22,691 --> 01:32:24,993
by her own family.

1207
01:32:24,995 --> 01:32:26,787
By their greed,

1208
01:32:27,554 --> 01:32:29,697
and their lies

1209
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:30,979
and their sins.

1210
01:32:33,474 --> 01:32:34,755
I'll tell your story.

1211
01:32:40,003 --> 01:32:41,315
You can let it go.

1212
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:44,963
You can let it go, Sarah.

1213
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:29,986
<i>Stories hurt.</i>

1214
01:33:30,498 --> 01:33:32,035
<i>Stories heal.</i>

1215
01:33:35,713 --> 01:33:37,984
<i>If we repeat them
often enough,</i>

1216
01:33:37,986 --> 01:33:38,947
<i>they become real.</i>

1217
01:33:39,777 --> 01:33:41,347
<i>They have that power.</i>

1218
01:33:44,896 --> 01:33:46,462
<i>They make us who we are.</i>

1219
01:33:46,464 --> 01:33:47,488
Stella.

1220
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:49,281
I'm just so happy
you're okay.

1221
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:04,449
<i>And if there's
anything I learned from Sarah,</i>

1222
01:34:05,985 --> 01:34:07,841
<i>it's to never give up.</i>

1223
01:34:10,272 --> 01:34:13,409
<i>I told Sarah's story
exactly as I promised.</i>

1224
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:18,014
<i>I wrote about
the pale, lonely girl</i>

1225
01:34:18,016 --> 01:34:20,863
<i>who wrote stories
in the dark.</i>

1226
01:34:20,865 --> 01:34:24,033
<i>And how she was turned
into a monster by her family.</i>

1227
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:30,622
<i>Some people believed me.
Most didn't.</i>

1228
01:34:30,624 --> 01:34:32,541
<i>Because, like Sarah,</i>

1229
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:34,238
<i>I was a lonely girl</i>

1230
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,607
<i>who knew how to tell
a good creepy story.</i>

1231
01:34:43,263 --> 01:34:44,225
Write me?

1232
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,217
Every day.

1233
01:34:58,753 --> 01:34:59,809
See you around.

1234
01:35:04,255 --> 01:35:05,405
What's your name, kid?

1235
01:35:05,407 --> 01:35:06,464
Ramon Morales.

1236
01:35:10,943 --> 01:35:13,121
<i>Stories can
teach us to care.</i>

1237
01:35:16,543 --> 01:35:17,917
<i>They make us brave enough</i>

1238
01:35:17,919 --> 01:35:19,680
<i>to admit that
we need each other.</i>

1239
01:35:20,704 --> 01:35:23,264
<i>Give us a home to go back to.</i>

1240
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:39,133
<i>Chuck and Auggie
are still gone,</i>

1241
01:35:39,135 --> 01:35:42,493
<i>but I know there is a way
to bring them back</i>

1242
01:35:42,495 --> 01:35:44,256
<i>and that the secret
is in the book.</i>

1243
01:35:45,502 --> 01:35:47,583
<i>And we won't stop...</i>

1244
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:51,327
<i>until we find them.</i>

1245
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:22,855
