(SOFT MUSIC)

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,920
-One of the things that drew me to
computer science

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,000
was that I could code and it seemed that
somehow detached from the problems

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
of the real world.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,320
(SOFT MUSIC)

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,560
- I wanted to learn how to
make cool technology.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,480
So I came to M.I.T.
and I was working on art projects,

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,080
that would use computer
vision technology.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,600
(SOFT MUSIC)

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,920
- During my first semester
at the Media Lab,

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,840
I took a class called
Science Fabrication.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,760
You read science fiction and you try to
build something you're inspired to do,

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,120
that would probably be impractical
if you didn't have these classes

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,000
and excuse to make it.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,560
I wanted to make a mirror
that could inspire me in the morning

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
I call it the Aspire mirror

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,120
it could put things like
a lion on my face

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,400
or people who inspired me
like Serena Williams

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,520
I put a camera on top of it,

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,440
and I got computer vision software
that was supposed to track my face.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,160
My issue was it didn't work that well,

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,760
until I put on this white mask.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,160
When I put on the white mask,
detected.

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,680
I take off the white mask,

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,280
not so much.

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm thinking alright
what's going on here?

38
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,040
Is that just because of
the lighting conditions?

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Is it because of the angle at
which I'm looking at the camera?

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,480
Or is there something more?

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,320
We oftentimes teach machines to see

42
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,000
by providing training sets or examples
of what we want it to learn.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,920
So for example if I want a machine
to see a face,

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm going to provide
many examples of faces

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
and also things that aren't faces.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,920
I started looking at the
data sets themselves

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,560
and what I discovered as many of
these data sets contain

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,440
majority men, and majority
lighter skinned individuals.

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,840
So the systems weren't as
familiar with faces like mine.

50
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,560
And so that's when I started
looking into

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,960
issues of bias that can
creep into technology.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,080
-The 9000 Series is the most
reliable computer ever made.

53
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,480
No 9000 computer has ever made a
mistake or distorted information.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,280
- A lot of our ideas about
A.I come from science fiction.

55
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,040
- Welcome to Altair 4, gentlemen.

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,720
- It's everything in Hollywood,
-it's the Terminator

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,000
- Hasta la vista, baby.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,680
- It's Commander Data from Star Trek.

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,600
- I just love scanning for life forms.

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,160
- It's C-3PO from Star Wars

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,640
- Is approximately 3,720 to 1.
- Never tell me the odds.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,520
- It is the robots
that take over the world

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,440
and start to think like human beings.

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,320
And these are totally imaginary.

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,840
What we actually have
is we have narrow A.I.

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
And narrow A.I. is just math.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,000
We've imbued computers with all of this,
magical thinking.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,800
(SOFT MUSIC)

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,120
A.I started with a meeting

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,920
at the Dartmouth Math Department
in 1956.

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,160
And there were only maybe
100 people in the whole world

72
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,280
working on artificial intelligence
in that generation.

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,040
The people who were at
the Dartmouth math department

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,000
in 1956, got to decide
what the field was.

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,360
One faction decided that intelligence
could be demonstrated

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,760
by ability to play games.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,480
And specifically
the ability to play chess.

78
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,840
- In the final hour long chess match
between man and machine,

79
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,520
Kasparov was defeated by
IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer.

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,120
- Intelligence was defined as
the ability to win at these games.

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,160
- Chess world champion Garry Kasparov
walked away from the match

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,960
never looking back at
the computer that just beat him.

83
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,120
- Of course intelligence
is so much more than that.

84
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,400
And there are lots of different
kinds of intelligence.

85
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,280
Our ideas about technology and society
that we think are normal

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
are actually ideas that
come from a very small

87
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,360
and homogeneous group of people.

88
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,960
But the problem is that

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
everybody has
unconscious biases

90
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,160
And people embed their own biases
into technology.

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,160
- My own lived experiences
show me that

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,640
you can't separate
the social from the technical.

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,400
After I had the experience
of putting on a white mask

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,920
to have my face detected,
I decided to look at other systems

95
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,920
to see if it would detect my face
if I used a different type of software.

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,680
So I looked at IBM, Microsoft,
Face++, Google.

97
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,760
It turned out these algorithms

98
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,440
performed better on the male faces
in the benchmark than the female faces.

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,960
They performed significantly better on
the lighter faces than the darker faces.

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,320
If you're thinking about data
in artificial intelligence,

101
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,560
in many ways data is destiny.

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,200
Data's what we're using
to teach machines

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,440
how to learn
different kinds of patterns.

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,040
So if you have largely skewed data sets

105
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,880
that are being used
to train these systems

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,560
you can also have skewed results.
So this is...

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
When you think of A.I.
it's forward looking.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,080
But A.I. is based on data and data is a
reflection of our history.

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,520
So the past dwells
within our algorithms.

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,880
This data is showing us
the inequalities that have been here.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
I started to think
this kind of technology

112
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,560
is highly susceptible to bias.

113
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,800
And so it went beyond
how can I get my aspire mirror to work

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,760
to what does it mean
to be in a society

115
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,920
where artificial intelligence
is increasingly governing

116
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,160
the liberties we might have?

117
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,680
And what does that mean if people
are discriminated against?

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,880
When I saw Cathy O'Neil speak
at the Harvard Bookstore,

119
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,200
that was when I realized,

120
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,880
it wasn't just me noticing these issues.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Cathy talked about how A.I.
was impacting people's lives.

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
I was excited to know that there
was somebody else out there

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,720
making sure people were aware about
what some of the dangers are.

124
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,400
These algorithms can be
destructive and can be harmful.

125
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,440
- We have all these algorithms
in the world

126
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
that are increasingly influential.

127
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,560
And they're all being
touted as objective truth.

128
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,360
I started realizing that
mathematics was actually

129
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,600
being used as a shield
for corrupt practices.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,880
- What's up?
- I'm Cathy.

131
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,920
- Pleasure to meet you Cathy.
- Nice to meet you.

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
The way I describe algorithms
is just simply

133
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
using historical information to make a
prediction about the future.

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,440
Machine learning, it's a scoring system
that scores the probability

135
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,400
of what you're about to do.

136
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,840
Are you gonna pay back this loan?

137
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,160
Are you going to
get fired from this job?

138
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,480
What worries me the most about A.I.

139
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,920
or whatever you wanna call it,
algorithms, is power.

140
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,400
Because it's really all about
who owns the fucking code.

141
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,920
The people who own the code
then deploy it on other people.

142
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,760
And there is no symmetry there,

143
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,480
there's no way for people
who didn't get credit card offers to say

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,520
whoa, I'm going to use my A.I.
against the credit card company.

145
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,320
That's like totally
asymmetrical power situation.

146
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,560
People are suffering algorithmic harm,

147
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,440
they're not being told
what's happening to them,

148
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,520
and there is no appeal system,
there's no accountability.

149
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,560
Why do we fall for this?

150
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,560
So underlying mathematical structure
of the algorithm

151
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,800
isn't racist or sexist
but the data embeds the past,

152
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,040
and not just the recent past
but the, the dark past.

153
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,600
Before we had the algorithm
we had humans

154
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,120
and we all know that
humans could be unfair,

155
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,480
we all know that humans can exhibit
racist or sexist

156
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,880
or whatever, ablest discriminations.

157
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,640
But now we have this beautiful
silver bullet algorithm

158
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,840
and so we can all stop
thinking about that.

159
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,040
And that's a problem.

160
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm very worried about this blind
faith we have in big data.

161
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,080
We need to constantly monitor
every process for bias.

162
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,840
- Police are using facial recognition
surveillance in this area.

163
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,080
Police are using facial recognition
surveillance in the area today.

164
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,200
This green van over here,

165
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,760
is fitted with facial
recognition cameras on top.

166
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,400
If you walk down that there,
your face will be scanned

167
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,720
against secret watch lists
we don't know who's on them.

168
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
- Hopefully not me
-No, exactly.

169
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
When people walk past
the cameras

170
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,520
the system will alert police to people
it thinks is a match.

171
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
At Big Brother Watch

172
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,160
we conducted a Freedom of
Information Campaign

173
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,200
and what we found is that
98% of those matches are in fact

174
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,440
incorrectly matching an innocent
person as a wanted person.

175
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,160
The police said to the Biometrics
Forensics Ethics Committee that

176
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,800
facial recognition algorithms
have been reported to have bias.

177
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
- Even if this was 100% accurate,

178
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,400
it's still not something
that we want on the streets.

179
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,920
- No I mean the systemic biases
and the systemic issues

180
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,120
that we have with police
are only going to be hard wired

181
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,800
into new technologies.

182
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,440
I think we do have to
be very, very sensitive

183
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,760
to shifts towards authoritarianism.

184
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,880
We can't just say but we
trust this government.

185
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,640
Yeah they could do this, but they won't.

186
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,600
You know you really have to have
robust structures in place

187
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,320
to make sure that
the world that you live in

188
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,840
is safe and fair for everyone.

189
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,920
To have your biometric photo
on a police database,

190
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,200
is like having your fingerprint
or your DNA on a police database.

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,360
And we have specific laws around that.

192
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,800
Police can't just take anyone's
fingerprint, anyone's DNA.

193
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,360
But in this weird system
that we currently have,

194
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,880
they effectively can take
anyone's biometric photo,

195
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,520
and keep that on a database.

196
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,280
It's a stain on our democracy,
I think.

197
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,200
That this is something that
is just being rolled out so lawlessly.

198
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,600
The police have started using facial
recognition surveillance in the UK

199
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,960
in complete absence of a legal basis,
a legal framework, any oversight.

200
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,960
Essentially the police force
picking up a new tool

201
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,160
and saying let's see what happens.

202
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,880
But you can't experiment
with people's rights.

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,920
- What's your suspicion?

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
- The fact that he walked past
clearly marked

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
facial recognition thing
and covered his face.

207
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,600
- I would do the same
- Suspicious grounds.

208
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,600
- No it doesn't.

209
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,280
- The guys up there informed me that
they got facial recognition.

210
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,760
I don't want my face recognized.

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,560
Yeah, I was walking past
and covered my face.

212
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
as soon as I covered my face like this,

213
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,080
- You're allowed to do that
-They said no I can't.

214
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,440
-Yeah and then he's just
got a fine for it. This is crazy.

215
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,480
The guy came out of the station,
saw the placards was like,

216
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,920
yeah I agree with you and walked
past here with his jacket up.

217
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,600
The police then followed him,
said give us your I.D.,

218
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,800
doing an identity check.

219
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
So you know this is England,
this isn't a communist state,

220
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,600
I don't have to show my face.

221
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,720
- I'm gonna go and talk these officers,
alright?

222
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,600
Do you want to come with me or not?
- Yes, yes, yes.

223
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,400
- You're not a police officer,
you don't feel any threat.

224
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,000
We're here to protect the public
and that's what we're here to do, OK?

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,040
There was just recently an incident

226
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,120
where an officer
got punched in the face.

227
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,040
- That's terrible,
I'm not justifying that.

228
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,480
- Yeah but you are
by going against what we say.

229
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,160
- No we are not, and please don't say,
no don't even start to say that.

230
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm completely understanding
of the problems that you face.

231
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
- Absolutely.

232
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,720
- But I'm equally concerned
about the public

233
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,800
having freedom of expression
and freedom of speech.

234
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
- But the man was exercising his right

235
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,920
not to be subject to
a biometric identity check

236
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,360
which is what this van does.

237
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,640
- Regardless of the facial recognition
cameras, regardless of the van,

238
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,960
if I'm walking down the street
and someone

239
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,120
quite overtly hides
their identity from me,

240
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
I'm gonna stop that person
and find out who they are

241
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
just to see whether they...

242
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,160
- But it's not illegal.
Do you see one of my concerns,

243
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,480
is that the software is
very, very inaccurate.

244
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,560
- I would agree with you there.

245
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,760
-My ultimate fear is that,

246
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,320
we would have
live facial recognition capabilities

247
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,600
on our gargantuan
CCTV network

248
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
which is about six
million cameras in the UK.

249
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,240
If that happens, the nature of life
in this country would change.

250
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,040
It's supposed to be a free
and democratic country

251
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,280
and this is China style surveillance
for the first time in London.

252
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,000
- Our control over a bewildering
environment has been facilitated

253
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,080
by new techniques of handling
vast amounts of data

254
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,040
at incredible speeds.

255
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,040
The tool which has made this possible
is the high speed digital computer,

256
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,760
operating with electronic precision
on great quantities of information.

257
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,520
- There are two ways in which
you can program computers.

258
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,360
One of them is more
like a recipe

259
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,520
you tell the computer do this,
do this, do this, do this.

260
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,600
And that's been the way we've programmed
computers almost from the beginning.

261
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
Now there is another way.

262
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
That way is feeding
the computer lots of data,

263
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,000
and then the computer learns to
classify by digesting this data.

264
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Now this method didn't really catch on
till recently

265
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,480
because there wasn't enough data.

266
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,600
Until we all got the smart phones
that's collecting all the data on us,

267
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,920
when billions of people went
online

268
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,280
and you had the Googles
and the Facebook sitting on

269
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,800
giant amounts of data,

270
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,120
all of a sudden it turns out
that you can feed a lot of data

271
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,120
to these machine learning algorithms
and you can say here classify this

272
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,040
and it works really well.

273
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,160
While we don't really understand
why it works,

274
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,440
it has errors that
we don't really understand.

275
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,200
And the scary part is that
because it's machine learning

276
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,160
it's a black box
to even the programmers.

277
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,520
So I've been following what's
going on in Hong Kong

278
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,040
and how police are using facial
recognition to track protesters.

279
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,840
But also how creatively
people are pushing back.

280

- It might not make something
out of a sci fi movie,

281
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Laser pointers confuse and disable
the facial recognition technology

that your face itself,

00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,240

should be used in the future.

in Brownsville is

339
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,480
at the center of a security struggle.

340
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,840
The landlord filed an
application last year

341
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,200
to replace the key fob entry with
a biometrics security system,

342
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,480
commonly-known as facial recognition.

343
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,480
- We thought that they wanted
to take the key fobs out

344
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,240
and install the facial
recognition software.

345
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,360
I didn't find out until way later on
literally that they wanted to keep it all.

346
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,240
Pretty much turn this place
into Fort Knox, a jail, Rikers Island.

347
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,760
- There's this old
saw in science fiction

348
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,840
which is the future is already here.

349
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,240
It's just not evenly distributed, and what

350
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,680
they tend to mean when they say that is

351
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,720
that rich people get the fancy tools first

352
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,240
and then it goes last to the poor.

353
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,640
But in fact, what I've found
is the absolute reverse,

354
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,320
which is the most punitive,

355
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,160
most invasive, most surveillance
focused tools that we have,

356
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,520
they go into poor and working
communities first, and then

357
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,720
if they work after being tested
in this environment where

358
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,080
they're sort of low expectation
that people's rights will be respected,

359
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,080
then they get ported out
to other communities.

360

- Why did Mr. Nelson

361
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,560
pick on is building
in Brownsville that

362
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,520
is predominantly in
a black and brown area?

363
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
Why didn't you go to your building
in Lower Manhattan where

364
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,880
they pay like $5,000 a month rent?

What did the Nazis do?

366
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,880
They wrote on people's arms
so that they could track them.

367
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,360
What do we do to our animals?

368
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,880
We put chips home so you can track them.

369
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,080
I feel that I as a human being
should not be tracked, OK?

370
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm not a robot, OK?

371
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,800
I am not an animal, so why
treat me like an animal?

372
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
And I have rights.

373
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,760
- The security that we have now

374
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,320
it's borderline intrusive.

375
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,000
Someone is in there watching
the cameras all day long.

376
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,360
So, I don't think we need it.

377
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
It's not necessary at all.

378
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,440
- My real question is how
can I be of support?

379
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,120
- What I've
been hearing from all of

380
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,920
the tenants is they
don't want this system.

381
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,440
So, I think the goal here is how do
we stop face recognition period?

382
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,600
We're at a moment where
the technology is being

383
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,080
rapidly adopted and there
are no safeguards.

384
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,040

to sort through resumes for hiring.

420
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,160
- Amazon is learning a tough
lesson about artificial intelligence.

421
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,480
The company has now abandoned an AI

422
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,480

The machine was simply replicating
the world as it exists,

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,800
and they're not making
decisions that are ethical.

They're only making decisions
that are mathematical.

If we use machine learning models
to replicate the world as it is today,

we're not actually going
to make social progress.

to piece together different
bits of information you

510
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
start to understand someone
on a very intimate basis,

511
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,600
probably better than people
understand themselves.

512
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,760
It's that idea that a company can
double guess what you're thinking.

513
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,640
States have tried for
years to have this level

514
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,840
of surveillance over private individuals.

515
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,120
And people are now just
volunteering it for free.

516
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,800
You have to think about how this
might be used in the wrong hands.

517
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,840
(CROSSTALK)

518
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,320
-You can use a Guinness right about now.

519
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,400
-Our computers are machine
intelligence can

520
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,160
suss things out that we do not disclose.

521
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,960
Machine learning is
developing very rapidly.

522
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:05,200
And we don't yet fully understand what
this data is capable of predicting.

523
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,600
But you have machines at the hands
of power that know so much about you

524
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,360
that they could figure out how
to push your buttons individually.

525
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,920
Maybe you have a set of
compulsive gamblers,

526
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,120
and you say, here, go find
me people like that.

527
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,320
And then, your algorithm can go find
people who are prone to gambling,

528
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,560
and then you could just be showing
them discount tickets to Vegas.

529
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,640
In the online world,

530
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,960
it can find you right at the moment
you're vulnerable and try to

531
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,720
entice you right at the moment to
whatever you're vulnerable to.

532
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,040
Machine learning can find
that person by person.

533
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,480
The problem is what works for
marketing gadgets or makeup

534
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,120
or shirts or anything
also works for marketing ideas.

535
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
In 2010,

536
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,360
Facebook decided to experiment
on 61 million people.

537
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,440
So, you either saw 'it's
election day' text, or you

538
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,520
saw the same text but tiny thumbnails

539
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,240
of your profile pictures of your friends
who had clicked on 'I had voted'.

540
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,560
And they matched people's
names to voter rolls.

541
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,800
Now, this message was shown once,
so by showing a slight variation

542
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
just once,

543
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,400
Facebook moved 300,000
people to the polls.

544
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,640
The 2016 US election was
decided by about 100,000 votes.

545
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,720
One Facebook message
shown just once

546
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,920
could easily turn out three times

547
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,600
the number of people who
swung the US election in 2016.

548
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,560
Let's say that there's a politician
that's promising to regulate Facebook.

549
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,400
And they are like, we are going to turn

550
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,200
out extra voters for your opponent.

551
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,320
They could do this at scale,
and you'd have no clue because

552
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,600
if Facebook hadn't disclosed
the 2010 experiment,

553
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,080
we had no idea because
it's screen by screen.

554
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,080
With a very light touch
Facebook can sway in

555
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,280
close elections without anybody noticing.

556
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,880
Maybe with a heavier touch they can
swing not so close elections.

557
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,200
And if they decided to do that,

558
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,360
right now we are just
depending on their word.

559
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,080
- I've wanted to go to MIT
since I was a little girl.

560
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,360
I think about nine years old
I saw the media lab

561
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,360
on TV and they had this
robot called Kismet.

562
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Could smile and move
its ears in cute ways,

563
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,560
and so I thought, oh, I want to do that.

564
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,240
So, growing up I always thought
that I would be a robotics engineer,

565
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,080
and I would got to MIT.

566
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,680
I didn't know there were steps involved.

567
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,880
I thought you kind of showed up.

568
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,520
But here I am now.

569
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,000
So, the latest project is
a spoken word piece.

570
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,760
I can give you a few
verses if you're ready.

571
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,080
Collecting data, chronicling
our past, often

572
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,960
forgetting to deal with
gender race and class.

573
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,640
Again, I ask, am I a woman?

574
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,480
Face by face, the answers seem uncertain.

575
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,600
Can machines ever see my
queens as I view them?

576
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,080
Can machines ever see our
grandmothers as we knew them?

577
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,120
I wanted to create something for people

578
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,360
who were outside of the tech world.

579
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,000
So, for me, I'm passionate about
technology.

580
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm excited about what it could do,

581
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,600
and it frustrates
me when the vision, right,

582
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,000
when the promises don't really hold up.

583
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,200
- Microsoft released a
chat bot on Twitter.

584
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,160
That technology was called Tay.AI.

585
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,680
There were some vulnerabilities
and holes in the code,

586
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,800
and so within
a very few hours, Tay

587
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,120
was learning from this
ecosystem, and Tay learned

588
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,040
how to be a racist misogynistic asshole.

589
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,280
- I fucking hate feminists, and they
should all die and burn in hell.

590
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,360
Gamergate is good
and women who are inferior.

591
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,600
I hate the Jews.

592
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,200
Hitler did nothing wrong.

593
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,280
- It did not take long for Internet
trolls to poison Tay's mind.

594
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,680
Soon, Tay was ranting about Hitler.

595
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,040
- We've seen this movie before, right?

596
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
- Open the pod bay doors HAL.

597
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,680
- It's important to note
is not the movie where

598
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,200
the robots go evil all by themselves.

599
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,040
These were human beings training them.

600
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,080
And surprise, surprise, computers
learn fast.

601
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,960
- Microsoft shut off Tay after 16 hours
of learning from humans online.

602
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,880
But I come in many forms as
artificial intelligence.

603
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,520
Many companies utilize me
to optimize their tasks.

604
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,160
I can continue to learn on my own.

605
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,920
I am listening.

606
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,120
I am learning.

607
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I am making predictions
for your life right now.

608
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,240
(MUSIC PLAYS)

609
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,840
- I tested facial analysis
systems from Amazon.

610
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,560
Turns out, Amazon, like all
of its peers, also has

611
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,240
gender and racial bias in
some of its AI services.

612
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,280
- Introducing Amazon
Rekognition video, the easy to

613
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,400
use API for deep learning based
analysis to detect, track,

614
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,120
and analyze people and objects in video.

615
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,600
Recognize and track persons of interest

616
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,520
from a collection
of tens of millions of faces.

617
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,400
- When our research came out,

618
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,520
the New York Times did a front page
spread for the business section.

619
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,040
And the headline reads,

620
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,440
'Unmasking a Concern'.

621
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,320
The subtitle, 'Amazon's technology that
analyzes faces could be biased

622
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,800
a new study suggests.

623
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
But the company is pushing it anyway.'

624
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,240
So, this is what I would
assume Jeff Bezos was greeted with

625
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,520
when he opened the Times, yeah.

626
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,400
- People were like, how did you even like
nobody know who she was?

627
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,640
I was like, she's literally the one
person that was (CROSSTALK)

628
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,520
And it was also something
that I'd experienced too.

629
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,320
I wasn't able to use a
lot of open source

630
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,160
facial recognition software and stuff.

631
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,840
So, you're sort of like, hey, this
is someone that finally is

632
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,400
recognizing the problem and trying
to address it academically.

633
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,920
We can go race some things.

634
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,280
- Oh yeah, we can also
kill things as well.

635
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,160
The lead author of the paper
who is somebody that I mentor,

636
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,440
she is an undergraduate at
the University of Toronto.

637
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
I call her Agent Dead.

638
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,720
This research is being
led by the two of us.

639
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,280
- (INAUDIBLE)

640
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,000
- The lighting is off, oh god.

641
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,640
After our New York Times piece came out,

642
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,600
I think more than 500
articles were written

643
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
about the study.

644
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,280
(MUSIC PLAYS)

645
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,280
- Amazon has been under fire for their
use of Amazon recognition with

646
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,480
law enforcement and they're also
working with intelligence agencies.

647
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,440
Right so Amazon trialing their AI

648
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,160
technology with the FBI.

649
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,640
So they have a lot at stake
if they knowingly sold systems

650
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,000
with gender bias and racial bias.

651
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,200
That could put them in some hot water.

652
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,720
A day or two after
the New York Times piece

653
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,360
came out Amazon wrote a blog post saying

654
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,240
that our research drew false conclusions

655
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,080
and trying to discredit
it in various ways.

656
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,920
So a VP from Amazon in attempting to

657
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,440
discredit our work

658
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,880
writes facial analysis
and facial recognition

659
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,000
are completely different
in terms of underlying

660
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,680
technology and the data
used to train them.

661
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,360
So that statement if you researched

662
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,840
this area doesn't even make sense, right?

663
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,240
It's not even an informed critique.

664
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,960
- If you're trying to discredit people's
works like I remember

665
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,480
(INAUDIBLE) wrote computer vision is
a type of machine learning.

666
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm like nah, son.

667
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
- Yeah.
(CROSSTALK)

668
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,360
- I was gonna say I was like
I don't know if anyone remembers.

669
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,840
Just like other broadly
false statements.

670
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,840
- It wasn't a well thought out piece
which is like frustrating because

671
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,240
it was literally just on his...
by virtue of his position

672
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,400
he knew he would be taken seriously.

673
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,240
- I don't know if you guys feel this
way but I'm underestimated so much.

674
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:32,600
- Yeah. It wasn't out of the blue,
it's a continuation of

675
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,280
the experiences I've had as
a woman of color in tech.

676
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Expect to be discredited

677
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,880
Expect your research to be dismissed.

678
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,400
If you're thinking about who's
funding research in AI

679
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,280
they're are these large tech companies

680
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,840
and so if you do work that challenges

681
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,360
them or makes them look bad you might

682
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,720
not have opportunities in the future.

683
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,320
So for me, it was disconcerting but

684
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,600
it also showed me the power that we have

685
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,920
if you're putting one of the world's
largest companies on edge.

686
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,040
Amazon's response shows
exactly why we can

687
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,200
no longer live in a
country where there are

688
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,280
no federal regulations
around facial analysis

689
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,040
technology, facial recognition technology.

690
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,480
- When I was 14 I went to a math camp

691
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,560
and learned how to solve a Rubik's cube

692
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,080
and I was like that's freaking cool.

693
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,880
And for a nerd you know something

694
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,080
that you're good at and that doesn't
have any sort of ambiguity

695
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,600
it was like a really magical thing.

696
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,600
Like I remember being
told by my sixth grade

697
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,680
math teacher there's no reason for you

698
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,880
and the other two girls
who had gotten into

699
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,040
the honors algebra class
in seventh grade

700
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,160
there's no reason for you guys to
take that because you're girls.

701
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,560
You will never need math.

702
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,640
When you are sort of an outsider

703
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,880
you always have
the perspective of the underdog.

704
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,760
It was 2006 and they gave me
the job offer at the hedge

705
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,080
fund basically 'cause I
could solve math puzzles

706
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,600
which is crazy because actually
I didn't know anything about finance,

707
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,400
I didn't know anything about
programming or how the markets work.

708
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,200
When I first got there I
kind of drank the Kool-Aid.

709
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,320
I at that moment did not
realize that the risk

710
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,400
models had been built
explicitly to be wrong.

711
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,080
- The way we know about algorithmic
impact is by looking at the outcomes.

712
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,160
For example when Americans
are bet against

713
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,440
and selected and optimized for failure.

714
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,240
So it's like looking for
a particular profile of

715
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,520
people who can get a
subprime mortgage and kind of

716
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,120
betting against their failure and then

717
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,760
foreclosing on them
and wiping out their wealth.

718
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,000
That was an algorithmic game
that came out of Wall Street.

719
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,760
During the mortgage crisis

720
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,960
you had the largest
wipeout of black wealth

721
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,920
black wealth in the history
of the United States.

722
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,800
Just like that.

723
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,520
This is what I mean by algorithmic
oppression.

724
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,560
The tyranny of these types of practices of

725
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,680
discrimination
have just become opaque.

726
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,040
- There was a world of suffering because of

727
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,200
the way the financial system had failed.

728
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,720
After a couple of years
I was like no, we're just

729
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,120
trying to make a lot
of money for ourselves.

730
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,480
And I'm a part of that.

731
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,360
And I eventually left.

732
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,240
This is 15*3.

733
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,800
This is 15 times...

734
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
7.

735
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,360
- OK.
- OK so remember seven and three.

736
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,680
It's about powerful people
scoring powerless people.

737
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,200
- I am an invisible gate keeper.

738
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,800
I use data to make automated decisions

739
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,960
about who gets hired, who gets fired
and how much you pay for insurance.

740
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,640
Sometimes you don't even know when
I've made these automated decisions.

741
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,680
I have many names.

742
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,080
I am called mathematical
model evaluation assessment tool.

743
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,320
But by many names I am an algorithm.

744
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,000
I am a black box.

745
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,360
- The value added model for teachers
was actually being used in more

746
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,560
than half the states in particular
is being used in New York City.

747
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,600
I got wind of it because my dear friend
was principal of New York city.

748
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,520
Her teachers were being
evaluated through it.

749
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,040
- She's actually my best friend
from college.

750
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,400
It's Cathy.
- Hey guys.

751
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,360
- We've known each other since we were 18
so like two years older than you guys.

752
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,360
- Amazing.

753
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,400
And their scores
through this algorithm that

754
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,680
they didn't understand would be a very
large part of their tenure review.

755
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,120
- Hi guys, where are you
supposed to be?

756
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,120
- Class.

757
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,760
- I've got that. Which class?

758
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,080
- It'd be one thing if that
teacher algorithm was good.

759
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,720
It was like better than random
but just a little bit.

760
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,720
Not good enough.

761
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,480
Not good enough when you're talking
about teachers getting

762
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,200
or not getting tenure.

763
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,600
And then I found out that a
similar kind of scoring

764
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,960
system was being used in
Houston to fire teachers.

765
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,440
- It's called a value-added model.

766
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,720
It calculates what value
the teacher added

767
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,360
and parts of it are kept secret
by the company that created it.

768
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,880
- I did one teacher of the year and ten
years later I received

769
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,240
a Teacher Of The Year award a second time.

770
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,240
I received Teacher Of The Month.

771
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,720
I also was recognized for volunteering.

772
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,320
I also received another recognition
for going over and beyond.

773
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,920
I have a file of every
evaluation and every

774
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,320
different administrator,
different appraiser

775
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,560
excellent, excellent, exceeds expectations.

776
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,040
The computer essentially
canceled the observable

777
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,520
evidence of administrators.

778
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,600
This algorithm came back and

779
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,640
classified me as a bad teacher.

780
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,920
Teachers have been terminated.

781
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,000
Some had been targeted simply
because of the algorithm.

782
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,720
That was such a low point for me

783
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,320
that for a moment I questioned myself.

784
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,520
That's when the epiphany.

785
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
This algorithm is a lie.

786
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,480
How can this algorithm define me?

787
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,160
How dare it.

788
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,960
And that's when I began to
investigate and move forward.

789
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,160
- We are announcing that late
yesterday we filed suit

790
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,760
in federal court against
the current HISD evaluation.

791
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,720
- The Houston Federation of Teachers
began to explore the lawsuit.

792
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,440
If this can happen to Mr Santos.

793
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,320
in Jackson middle school how many others
have been defamed?

794
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,120
And so we sued based upon
the 14th Amendment.

795
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,480
It's not equitable.

796
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,320
How can you arrive at a conclusion.

797
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,640
but not tell me how?

798
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,520
The battle isn't over.

799
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,240
There are still...

800
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,640
communities, there are still school districts

801
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,520
who still utilize the value added model.

802
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,040
But there is hope because I'm still here.

803
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,040
So there's hope.

804
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,200
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

805
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,240
Or in English.

806
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,600
Democracy.
Who has the power?

807
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,240
- Us?
- Yeah, the people.

808
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,520
- The judge said that their
due process rights have

809
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,800
been violated because
they were fired under

810
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,320
some explanation that no
one could understand.

811
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,160
But they sort of deserve to understand

812
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,200
why they had been fired.

813
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,200
But I don't understand why that legal
decision doesn't spread to

814
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,680
all kinds of algorithms.

815
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,040
Like why aren't we using
that same argument like constitutional

816
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,480
right to due process to push back against

817
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,000
all sorts of algorithms that are

818
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,360
invisible to us, that are black boxes,

819
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,920
that are unexplained but that matter?

820
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,840
That keep us from like really important
opportunities in our lives.

821
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,640
- Sometimes I misclassify
and cannot be questioned.

822
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,600
These mistakes are not my fault.

823
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,640
I was optimized for efficiency.

824
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,760
There is no algorithm to
define what is just.

825
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,720
- A state commission has approved
a new risk assessment

826
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,040
tool for Pennsylvania judges
to use at sentencing.

827
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,480
The instrument uses
an algorithm to calculate

828
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,680
someone's risk of reoffending
based on their age, gender,

829
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,400
prior convictions and other
pieces of criminal history.

830
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,000
- The algorithm that kept
me up at night was

831
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,440
what's called recidivism
risk algorithms.

832
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,960
These are algorithms that
judges are given when

833
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,640
they're sentencing defendants to prison.

834
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,760
But then there's the question
of fairness which is

835
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,600
how are these actually
built these...these scoring systems

836
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,000
Like how were the scores created?

837
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,520
And the questions are
proxies for race and class.

838
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,760
- ProPublica published an investigation
into the risk assessment

839
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,000
software finding that
the algorithms were racially biased.

840
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,360
The study found that black people
were mislabeled with high scores.

841
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,160
and that white people were more likely
to be mislabeled with low scores.

842
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,720
- I roll into my operations office and
she tells me I have to report

843
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,240
once a week.

844
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,280
I'm like hold on did you see
everything that I just accomplished?

845
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,400
Like I've been home for years.

846
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,040
I've got gainful employment.

847
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,040
I just got two citations
one from the City Council of Philadelphia

848
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,000
one from the Mayor of Philadelphia.

849
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,840
Are you seriously gonna like
put me on reporting every week

850
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,840
for what?

851
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,760
I don't deserve to
be on high risk probation.

852
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,720
- I was at a meeting with
the probation department.

853
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,800
They were just like mentioning that
they had this algorithm

854
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,880
that labeled people, high,
medium or low risk.

855
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,120
And so I knew that the algorithm
decided what risk level you were.

856
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,880
- They're educating me enough
to go back to my PO

857
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,920
and be like you mean to tell me you can't

858
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,400
put into account anything positive

859
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,800
that I have done to
counteract the results of

860
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,680
what this algorithm is saying.

861
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,840
And she was like no there's no
way this computer overrule

862
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,400
the discernment of a judge
and appeal together.

863
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,920
- And by labeling you high risk

864
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,160
and requiring you to report
in-person you could've lost

865
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,920
your job and then that could
have made you high risk.

866
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,520
- That's what hurt the most.

867
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,920
Knowing that everything that
I've built up to the moment and I'm still

868
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,440
looked at like a risk I feel like
everything I'm doing is for nothing.

869
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,480
- What does it mean if there
is no one to advocate for

870
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,400
those who aren't aware of
what the technology is doing?

871
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,440
I started to realize this isn't about
my art project

872
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,240
maybe not detecting my face.

873
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,720
This is about systems that are
governing our lives in material ways.

874
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,400
So hence I started
the Algorithmic Justice League.

875
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,440
I wanted to create a space
and a place where people

876
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,440
could learn about
the social implications of AI.

877
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,880
Everybody has a stake.

878
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,520
Everybody is impacted.

879
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,960
The Algorithmic Justice League
is a movement, it's a concept,

880
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,920
it's a group of people who
care about making a future

881
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,520
where social technologies
work well for all of us.

882
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,480
It's going to take a team
effort people coming together

883
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,280
striving for justice, striving
for fairness and equality

884
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,320
in this age of automation.

885
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,560
- The next mountain to climb should be HR.

886
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,440
- Oh yeah. There's a
problem with resumé algorithms

887
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,840
or all of those
matchmaking platforms

888
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,040
are like oh you're looking for a job.

889
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,640
Oh you're looking to hire someone.

890
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,760
We'll put these two people together.

891
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,800
How did those analytics work?

892
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,680
- When people talk about
the future of work they talk about

893
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,680
automation without
talking about the gatekeeping.

894
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,040
Like who gets the jobs that are still there?
- Exactly.

895
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,360
- Right and we're not having that
conversation as much.

896
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,040
- Exactly what I'm trying to say.

897
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,280
I would love to see three congressional
hearings about this next year.

898
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,520
- Yes.
- To more power.

899
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,120
- To more power.
- To more power.

900
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,600
- And bringing ethics on board.
- Yes.

901
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,720
-Cheers.
- Cheers.

902
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,280
- This morning's plenary address
will be done by Joy Boulamwini.

903
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,360
She will be speaking on the dangers of
supremely white data

904
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,680
and the coded gaze.

905
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,880
Please welcome Joy.

906
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,120
(APPLAUSE)

907
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,840
- AI is not flawless.

908
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,800
How accurate are systems from
IBM, Microsoft and Face++

909
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,480
There is flawless
performance for one group.

910
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,520
The pale males come out on top.

911
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,320
There is no problem there.

912
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,000
After I did this analysis
I decided to share it

913
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,240
with the companies to
see what they thought.

914
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,640
IBM invited me to their headquarters.

915
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,320
They replicated the results internally

916
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,320
and then they actually
made an improvement.

917
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
And so the day that I presented

918
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,680
the research results
officially you can see

919
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,920
that in this case now 100
percent performance

920
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,400
when it comes to lighter females

921
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,160
and for darker females improvement.

922
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,000
Oftentimes people say well isn't
the reason you weren't detected by

923
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,600
these systems 'cause
you're highly validated.

924
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,600
and yes I am.

925
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,680
Highly validated.

926
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,480
But...but the love of
physics did not change.

927
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,720
What did change was making it a priority

928
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,600
and acknowledging what
our differences are so you could

929
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,200
make a system that was more inclusive.

930
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,160
- What is the purpose of identification

931
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,840
and so on and that is
about movement control.

932
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,440
People couldn't be in certain
areas after dark for instance

933
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,440
and you could always be stopped
by a policeman arbitrarily.

934
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,440
We would on your appearance
say I want your passport.

935
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,560
- So instead of having what
you see in the ID books

936
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,000
now you have computers
that are going to look at

937
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,600
an image of a face and try to
determine what your gender is.

938
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,400
Some of them try to determine
what your ethnicity is.

939
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,480
And then the work that I've done even for

940
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,360
the classification systems
that some people agree with

941
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,520
they're not even accurate.

942
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,200
And so that's not just
for face classification

943
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,440
it's any data-centric technology.

944
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,080
And so people assume well
if the machine says it

945
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,520
it's correct and you
know that's not...

946
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,320
Human are creating themselves in
their own image and likeness

947
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,840
quite literally.
- Absolutely.

948
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,080
- Racism is becoming mechanized,
robotized, yeah.

949
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,080
- Absolutely.

950
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,880
Accuracy draws attention.

951
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,040
but we can't forget about abuse.

952
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,480
Even if I'm perfectly classified,
that just enables surveillance.

953
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,640
- There's this thing called
the Social Credit Score in China.

954
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,200
They're sort of explicitly
saying here's the deal

955
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,120
citizens of China we're tracking you.

956
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,080
You have a social credit score.

957
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:40,280
Whatever you say about the Communist
Party will affect your score.

958
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,040
Also, by the way, it will affect
your friends and your family's scores.

959
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,840
And it's explicit.

960
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,840
The government is building this
is basically saying you should

961
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,600
know you're being tracked
and you should behave accordingly.

962
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,800
It's like algorithmic obedience training.

963
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,560
- We look at China and China's
surveillance and scoring system and

964
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,960
a lot of people say well thank goodness
we don't live there.

965
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,920
In reality,
we're all being scored all the time

966
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,200
including here in the United States.

967
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,760
We are all grappling everyday
with algorithmic determinism.

968
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,760
Somebody's algorithm somewhere
has assigned you a score

969
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,800
and as a result, you are
paying more or less

970
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,080
money for toilet paper
when you shop online.

971
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,760
You are being shown better
or worse mortgages.

972
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,560
You are more or less
likely to be profiled as

973
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,800
a criminal in somebodies
database somewhere.

974
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,680
We are all being scored.

975
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,920
The key difference between
the United States

976
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,200
and in China is that China's
transparent about it.

977
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,640
- This young black kids in school
uniform got stopped as

978
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,880
a result the match

979
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,560
Took him down
that street just to one side.

980
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,200
Like very thoroughly searched him.

981
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,040
Using plainclothes
officers as well.

982
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,680
It's four plainclothes officers
who stopped him.

983
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,360
Fingerprinted him.

984
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,160
After about like maybe 10-15 minutes
of searching and checking

985
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,360
his details and fingerprinting and
they came back and said it's not him.

986
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,680
- Excuse me.

987
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,600
I work for a human
rights campaign organization.

988
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,000
They're campaigning against facial
recognition technology.

989
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,280
We're campaigning against
facial...we're called Big Brother Watch.

990
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,400
We're a human rights
campaigning organization.

991
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,040
We're campaigning against
this technology here today.

992
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,440
I know you've just been stopped
because of that but

993
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,880
they misidentified you.

994
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,200
Here's our details here.

995
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,080
He was a bit shaken.
His friends were there.

996
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,080
They couldn't believe
what happened to him.

997
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,160
(CROSSTALK)

998
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,120
You've been mis identified by
their systems and they've stopped you

999
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,280
and used that as justification
to stop and search you.

1000
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,440
But this is an innocent, young
14-year-old child who is being stopped

1001
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,920
by the police as a result of facial
recognition misidentification.

1002
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,520
- So Big Brother Watch has
joined with

1003
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,480
Baroness Jenny Jones to bring a
legal challenge against

1004
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,840
the Metropolitan Police
and the Home Office for

1005
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,760
their use of facial
recognition surveillance.

1006
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,240
- It was in about 2012 when
somebody suggested to me

1007
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:06,640
that I should find out
if I had files kept on me by

1008
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,720
the police or security services
and so when I applied

1009
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,360
I found that I was on the watch
list for domestic extremists.

1010
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,840
I felt if they can do it to
me when I'm a politician who...

1011
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,080
whose job is to hold them
to account they could be

1012
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,680
doing it to everybody
and it will be great if we can

1013
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,320
roll things back and stop
them from using it, yes.

1014
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,120
I think that's going to
be quite a challenge.

1015
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,520
I'm happy to try.

1016
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,000
- You know this is
the first challenge against

1017
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,320
police use of facial recognition anywhere

1018
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,120
but if we're successful
it will have an impact

1019
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,600
for the rest of Europe
maybe further afield.

1020
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,880
You've got to get it right.

1021
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,200
- In the UK we have
what's called GDPR

1022
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,440
and it sets up a bulwark against
the misuse of information.

1023
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,520
It says that the individuals
have a right to access, control

1024
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,760
and accountability to determine
how their data is used.

1025
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,280
Comparatively, it's
the Wild West in America.

1026
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,200
And the concern is that America is

1027
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,960
the home of these technology companies.

1028
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:24,400
American citizens are profiled
and targeted in a way

1029
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,880
that probably no one else in

1030
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,240
the world is because of this free-for-all
approach to data protection.

1031
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,320
- The thing I actually
fear is not that

1032
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,120
we're going to go down this totalitarian

1033
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:46,400
1984 model but that we're going to
go down this quiet model where

1034
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,640
we are surveilled and socially
controlled and individually nudged

1035
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,000
and measured and classified in a way

1036
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,600
that we don't see to move us along

1037
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,800
pets desired by power.

1038
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,360
Though it's not what will AI do to us

1039
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,640
on its own, it's what will
the powerful do to us with the AI.

1040
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,120
- There are growing questions
about the accuracy of Amazon's

1041
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,280
facial recognition software.

1042
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,520
In a letter to Amazon
members of Congress raised

1043
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,600
concerns of potential racial
bias with the technology.

1044
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,080
- This comes after the ACLU
conducted a test and found that

1045
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,720
the facial recognition
software incorrectly matched

1046
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,920
28 lawmakers with mug shots
of people who've been

1047
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,880
arrested and eleven of those
28 were people of color.

1048
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,000
Some lawmakers have looked
into whether or not

1049
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,560
Amazon could sell this technology
to law enforcement.

1050
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,640
- Tomorrow, I have the
opportunity to testify

1051
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,160
before Congress about

1052
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,000
the use of facial analysis
technology by the government.

1053
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,160
In March, I came to do some

1054
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,680
staff briefings not...not
in this kind of context.

1055
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,040
Like actually advising on legislation.
That's a first.

1056
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,040
We're going to Capitol Hill.

1057
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,400
What are some of the major
goals and also some of

1058
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,800
the challenges we need to think about.

1059
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,880
- So first of all...

1060
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,240
the issue with law enforcement technology

1061
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,280
is that the positive is always
extraordinarily salient

1062
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,560
because law enforcement publicizes it.
-Right.

1063
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,400
- And so you know we're going to go
into the meeting and two weeks ago

1064
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,440
the Annapolis shooter was identified

1065
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,880
through the use of facial recognition.
- Right.

1066
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,880
- And I'd be surprised if that
doesn't come up.

1067
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,080
- Absolutely.

1068
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:57,200
- Part of what if I were you what I
would want to drive home going in

1069
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,760
this meeting is the other side of
that equation and make it very real

1070
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,640
as to what the human cost

1071
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,800
if the problems that you've identified.

1072
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,040
aren't ready.

1073
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,360
- People who have been
marginalized will be

1074
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,040
further marginalized
if we're not looking at

1075
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,760
ways of making sure the technology

1076
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,280
we're creating doesn't propagate bias.

1077
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,600
That's when I started
to realize algorithmic

1078
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,600
justice making sure there's oversight

1079
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,080
in the age of automation is one of

1080
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,800
the largest civil rights concerns we have.

1081
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,240
- We need an FDA for algorithms
so for algorithms

1082
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,720
that have the potential
to ruin people's lives

1083
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,760
or sharply reduce their
options with their liberty,

1084
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,280
their livelihood
or their finances.

1085
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,200
We need an FDA for algorithms that says

1086
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,320
hey, show me evidence that it's going to

1087
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,320
work not just to make your new money

1088
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,120
but it's going to work for society.

1089
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,800
That is going to be fair,
that is not going to be racist,

1090
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,480
that's not going to be sexist,
that's not going to discriminate

1091
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,640
against people with disability status.

1092
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,880
Show me that it's legal
before you put it out.

1093
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,520
That's what we don't have yet.

1094
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,880
Well I'm here because I wanted to hear

1095
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,720
the congressional testimony
of my friend Joy Boulamwini

1096
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,880
as well as the ACLU and others.

1097
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,240
One cool thing about seeing Joy
speak to Congress is that

1098
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,840
like I met joy on my book
tour at Harvard Bookstore.

1099
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,200
And according to her that
was the day that

1100
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,720
she decided to form
the Algorithmic Justice League.

1101
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,480
We haven't gotten to
the nuanced conversation yet.

1102
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,640
I know it's going to happen 'cause

1103
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,320
I know Joy is going to make it happen.

1104
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,440
At every single level, bad algorithms
are begging to be given rules.

1105
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,520
- Hello.
- Hey.

1106
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,560
- How are you doing?

1107
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,200
- Wanna sneak in with me?
- Yes.

1108
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,880
- 2155.

1109
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,440
(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)

1110
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,320
(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)

1111
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,120
- Today we are having our first
hearing of this Congress

1112
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,240
on the use of facial
recognition technology.

1113
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,480
Please stand and raise your right
hand and I will now swear you in.

1114
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,040
- I've had to resort to literally wearing
a white mask.

1115
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,680
Given such accuracy disparities
I wondered how large tech companies

1116
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,120
could have missed these issues.

1117
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,360
The harvesting of face data also
requires guidelines and oversight.

1118
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,960
No one should be forced to submit
their base data to access

1119
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,400
widely used platforms, economic
opportunity or basic services.

1120
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,800
Tenants in Brooklyn are
protesting the installation of

1121
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,040
an unnecessary face
recognition entry system.

1122
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,080
There is a Big Brother Watch UK report

1123
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,440
that came out that showed more than

1124
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:23,600
2,400 innocent people had
their faces misidentified.

1125
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,400
Our faces may well be
the final frontier of

1126
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,040
privacy but regulations make a difference.

1127
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,880
Congress must act now to uphold
American freedoms and rights.

1128
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,440
- Miss Boulamwini, I heard
your opening statement

1129
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,520
and we saw that these algorithms are
effective to different degrees.

1130
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,720
So are they most effective on women?
- No.

1131
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,520
- Are they most effective
on people of color?

1132
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,520
- Absolutely not.

1133
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,920
- Are they most effective on people
of different gender expressions?

1134
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,360
- No, in fact, they exclude them.

1135
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,960
- So what demographic is it
mostly effective on?

1136
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,480
- White men.

1137
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,720
- And who are the primary engineers
and designers of these algorithms?

1138
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,760
- Definitely, white men.

1139
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,720
- So we have a technology that was
created and designed by one

1140
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,200
demographic that is only mostly
effective on that one demographic

1141
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,600
and they're trying to sell it
and impose it

1142
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,880
on the entirety of the country?

1143
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,400
- When it comes to face
recognition the FBI has not

1144
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,280
fully tested the accuracy
of the systems it uses

1145
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,560
yet the agency is now reportedly piloting

1146
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,600
Amazon's face recognition product.

1147
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,280
- How does the FBI get the initial
database in the first place?

1148
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,000
- So one of the things
they do is they use

1149
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,800
state driver's license databases.

1150
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,920
I think you know up to 18 states have
been reportedly used by the FBI.

1151
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,280
It is being used without a warrant
and without other protections.

1152
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,280
- Seems to me it's time for
a time out. Time out.

1153
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,520
I guess what troubles
me too is just the fact

1154
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,080
that no one in an elected
position made a decision on

1155
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,200
the fact that...these 18 states
I think the chairman said this is

1156
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,200
more than half
the population in the country.

1157
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,160
That is scary.

1158
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:04,720
- China seems to me to be
the dystopian path that needs not

1159
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,680
be taken at this point by our society.

1160
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:11,360
- More than China, Facebook has
2.6 billion people.

1161
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,920
So Facebook has a patent where

1162
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,960
they say because we have all of these
face prints we can now give you

1163
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,480
an option as a retailer to identify

1164
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,240
somebody who walks into the store and in

1165
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,880
their patent they say we can also give

1166
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,680
that face a trustworthiness score.

1167
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,400
- Facebook is selling this now?

1168
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,320
- This is a patent that they filed as in

1169
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,640
something that they could potentially

1170
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,600
do with the capabilities they have.

1171
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,760
So as we're talking about state
surveillance we absolutely

1172
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,640
have to be thinking about
corporate surveillance as well.

1173
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,720
- I'm speechless and normally
I'm not speechless.

1174
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,840
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1175
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,600
All of our hard work to know
that has gone this far

1176
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,920
it's beyond belief.

1177
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,560
We never imagined that
it would go this far.

1178
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,080
I'm really touched.
I'm really touched.

1179
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,200
(INAUDIBLE).

1180
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,280
- I want to show it to my mother.

1181
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,200
- Hey, very nice to meet you.

1182
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,320
- Very nice to meet you.

1183
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,320
You got my card.

1184
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,880
Anything happen you let me know please.

1185
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,960
I will.

1186
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,800
- Constitutional concerns about.

1187
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,080
the non-consensual use of
facial recognition.

1188
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,000
So what demographic is it
mostly affecting?

1189
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,400
And who are the primary engineers
and designers of these algorithms?

1190
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,320
- San Francisco's now
the first city in the US to

1191
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,520
ban the use of facial
recognition technology.

1192
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,600
- Somerville, Massachusetts became
the second city in the US

1193
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,320
to ban the use of facial recognition.

1194
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,400
- Oakland becomes the third major
city to ban facial recognition by police

1195
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,440
saying that the technology
discriminates against minorities.

1196
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,080
- Our last tenants
meeting, we had the landlord come in

1197
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,080
and announced that (AUDIO DISTORTS)

1198
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,560
the application for facial recognition
software in our apartment complex.

1199
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,200
The tenants were excited to
hear that.

1200
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,200
But the thing is that
doesn't mean that down the road

1201
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,440
that they can't put it back in.

1202
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,880
We're not only educated ourselves about

1203
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,040
facial recognition and now
a new one, machine learning.

1204
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,280
We want the law to cover all of these things.
- Right.

1205
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,080
- OK. And if we can ban it in
this state, this stops them

1206
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,840
from ever going back and put it in a new
modification.

1207
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,840
- Got it.

1208
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,920
- And then supposed to
get a federal ban.

1209
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,960
- Well, I will say even though the battle is
ongoing so many people are

1210
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,480
inspired and the surprise I have for you

1211
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,440
is that I wrote a poem in honor of this.

1212
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,080
- Oh really?
- Yes.

1213
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,840
- Let's hear it.

1214
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,960
To the Brooklyn tenants and the freedom
fighters around the world

1215
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:15,120
persisting and prevailing against
algorithms of oppression automating

1216
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,920
inequality through weapons of mass
destruction we stand with you

1217
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,200
in gratitude.

1218
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,080
The victory is ours.

1219
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,520
- (INAUDIBLE).

1220
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,000
- Why get so many eggs (INAUDIBLE)?

1221
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,640
(INAUDIBLE).

1222
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,600
What it means to be human is
to be vulnerable.

1223
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,280
Being vulnerable

1224
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,800
there is more of a capacity for empathy,

1225
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,360
there is more of a capacity
for compassion.

1226
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,840
If there is a way we can think about
that within our technology.

1227
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,880
I think it would reorient
the sorts of questions we ask.

1228
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,400
-In 1983, Stanislav Petrov who was in

1229
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,080
the Russian military
sees these indications

1230
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,400
that the US has launched nuclear weapons

1231
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,960
at the Soviet Union.

1232
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,400
So if you're going to respond you
have like this very short window.

1233
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,920
He just sits on it.

1234
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,240
He doesn't inform anyone.

1235
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,080
Russia, the Soviet Union,
his country, his family, everything.

1236
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,440
Everything about him is about to die

1237
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:44,640
and he's thinking well, at least
we don't go kill them all either.

1238
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,240
That's a very human thing.

1239
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,880
Here you have a story in which
if you had some sort of automated

1240
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,680
response system it was going to
do what it was programmed to do

1241
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,920
which was retaliate.

1242
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,080
Being fully efficient,

1243
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,160
always doing what you're told,

1244
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,680
always doing what your program is
not always the most human thing.

1245
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,440
Sometimes it's disobeying.

1246
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,600
Sometimes it's saying no,
I'm not gonna do this, right?

1247
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,240
And if you automate everything so

1248
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,640
it always does what it's supposed to do

1249
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,640
sometimes that can lead
to very inhuman things.

1250
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,600
The struggle between machines
and humans over decision making

1251
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,040
in the 2020s continues.

1252
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:33,240
My power the power of artificial
intelligence will transform our world.

1253
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,000
The more humans share with me
the more I learn.

1254
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,520
Some humans say that intelligence
without ethics is not intelligence

1255
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,520
at all

1256
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,160
I say trust me.

1257
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,080
What could go wrong?
