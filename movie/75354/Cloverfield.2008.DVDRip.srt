1
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,433
It's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,303
Beth's Dad's place.

3
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,946
He's out of town.

4
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,955
And it's already a good day.

5
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,824
Beth.

6
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,564
-Rob, what are you doing?
-Nothing.

7
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,292
-Well, then stop.
-Nothing.

8
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,334
-That's...
-Stop it.

9
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,800
She's shy.

10
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,164
I could just see this
ending up on the internet.

11
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,834
Well, fine, cover up. See if I care.

12
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,969
-I'm interested in other things.
-Like what?

13
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,381
Like you.

14
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,255
-Oh, man.
-That was close.

15
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,750
Do it really... I'm scared of it.

16
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,830
-It's only 30 minutes out.
-Shut up. I've never been.

17
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,592
You've never been to Coney lsland?

18
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,189
Oh, how have you
never been to Coney lsland?

19
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,996
I don't know, I just... I've never been.

20
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,967
Oh, that's... It's so much fun.
I'm taking you. We're going.

21
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,299
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

22
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,498
-Yeah, I can't wait to...
-Give me this.

23
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,835
What are you doing? What?

24
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,671
Oh, all right. Well,
then from the neck up, okay?

25
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,335
That's the only way I consent to this.

26
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,935
Oh, please, Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

27
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,912
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs.com, have you?

28
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,075
-Okay. What else?
-What else, what?

29
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,278
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

30
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,323
-What do you want to do today?
-lf I answer that...

31
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,821
-All right, is this thing on?
-Look out!

32
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,951
Babe, it's not my camera.

33
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,689
I don't know if it's the on button
or the Zoom button.

34
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,424
All right. Here, here, here.
I think I got it. Is this on?

35
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,126
Oh, perfect. And now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

36
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,759
Is that funny?

37
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,462
What time is everybody
starting to show up?

38
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,596
-It's getting late here.
-A couple hours.

39
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,540
-That's why we have to hurry.
-Where are we going?

40
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,806
We're going... We're just going
around the corner to the store!

41
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,105
I want you to go around
with your brother's camera

42
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,080
and get testimonials from everyone.

43
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,516
Why? I mean,
it's not like this is a wedding.

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,748
I know it's not a wedding.
I said like a wedding.

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,557
I can't get this.

46
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,092
I don't get... I mean,
I don't understand why I have to do it.

47
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,856
'Cause, I mean, I don't...
I don't even know how to work this...

48
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,090
-That's what I think is gonna happen.
-No, I'm not!

49
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,496
-You totally are. You...
-You have no clue!

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,625
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

51
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,068
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

52
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,798
Yeah. Got you.

53
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,500
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

54
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,871
You're doing a great job.

55
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,309
Here, practice doing two things at once.

56
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,278
-That's good! That was good.
-Thank you.

57
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,406
I'm not lugging this thing around

58
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,505
-all night long.
-He is your brother.

59
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,675
This is important. Stop freaking out.

60
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,774
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

61
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,581
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

62
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,883
Jason, I have been planning this
for two weeks!

63
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,480
-All I want you to do is help me.
-Okay, babe, babe.

64
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,459
Okay. All right? I'll do it. It's fine.

65
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,161
I really pissed her off.

66
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,266
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

67
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,393
Hud? Hud, listen to me.
I got a job for you.

68
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,098
I already have got a job.

69
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,333
-I'm doing the sign, so...
-Yeah, no. I see that,

70
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,468
but this is more important than the sign.
You know how, like, at weddings,

71
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,910
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?

72
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,174
No.

73
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,349
All right. You're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party

74
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,250
and film people wishing Rob good luck.

75
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,379
I don't know, man.

76
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,786
-That's a lot of responsibility.
-This is important.

77
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:25,880
And then you have
to do it the whole night...

78
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,983
And Marlena's gonna be here.

79
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,118
-She is?
-Oh, yeah. She is.

80
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,456
-So you're gonna take that.
-Oh, hold on.

81
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,825
-And you're gonna talk to her...
-I didn't...

82
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,626
-For Rob.
-I didn't say I would do it.

83
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,825
-Just try it out.
-All right, I'll do a few.

84
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,027
You can, just do mine...

85
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,262
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, go.

86
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,736
All right.

87
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,034
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

88
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,269
Best of luck in Japan.
I love you so much,

89
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,608
and I'm proud of you.

90
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,279
-That's it.
-That's it?

91
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,514
-Yeah. Easy enough.
-Yeah. It's actually kind of fun.

92
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,948
-You enjoy it, Hud.
-Thanks, man.

93
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,116
Yeah, I'm doing...

94
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,653
Hey, what's up, man?

95
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,525
Hey, guys? Hey.

96
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,554
-What do we say?
-Anything.

97
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,033
Bon voyage, Rob.
Or however you say that in Japanese.

98
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,406
Yeah, good.
Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah...

99
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,771
-Hud, what are you doing?
-I'm documenting the night.

100
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,605
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,147
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,
so I've been doing it.

102
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,374
I've been doing it really well.

103
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,745
Well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?

104
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,216
Because it's really important.

105
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,583
No, of course. I've been taking it
really, really seriously.

106
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,712
-Very seriously.
-You promise?

107
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,484
Yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?

108
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,222
-Okay.
-Yeah, do it right now.

109
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,316
Okay.

110
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,986
Okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be

111
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,898
-the last thing he sees you...
-Okay, Hud, I got it.

112
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,227
-the last thing he sees you...
-Okay, Hud, I got it.

113
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,061
Robert Hawkins,

114
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,364
I can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

115
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,429
Oh! Easy, easy. I mean
I'm obviously standing right here...

116
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,374
And I know we're not officially family,
yet, but...

117
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,138
-Not fair, 'cause I'm gonna...
-Dude.

118
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,407
-Okay.
-I'll cut him out later.

119
00:06:55,515 --> 00:07:00,543
But I think of you as my brother,
and I hope you think of me as a sister.

120
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,985
So, you better call us.

121
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,653
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so...

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,660
-Hud?
-Yeah.

123
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,491
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

124
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,564
-That was good!
-That's it?

125
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,654
I thought that was really, really good.

126
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,757
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for...

127
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:29,014
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

128
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,216
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.

129
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,959
-What's up, man?
-Hey, what's up, dude?

130
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,153
What's up?

131
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,095
Excuse me! Hey, Marlena?

132
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,137
-Hey, what's up?
-Hi. Hi.

133
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,865
Hey, did you know that I'm going around

134
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,533
the party and I'm...
Do you know Rob's leaving?

135
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,940
-Like it's his going-away party.
-Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:04,312
Cool. Hey, so we're taping,
I think, people talking about him.

137
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,147
Oh, no, thank you.
I barely even know Rob.

138
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,619
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

139
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,155
if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

140
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,090
Okay, cool,
except I'm supposed to get everybody.

141
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,094
So have you ever been to a wedding?

142
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,359
No, I get what you're doing. I just...
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

143
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,765
Okay, cool.
We'll just do a short one real quick.

144
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,037
Okay.

145
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,845
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

146
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,681
I think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

147
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,878
and every one of those times
I was really drunk,

148
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,957
so I don't really even know what to say.

149
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,922
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

150
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,256
-Like you're president of something!
-Vice president!

151
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,795
Also really cool.

152
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,957
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

153
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,399
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

154
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,368
-Cool, that was a really good one.
-Yeah?

155
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,099
Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

156
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,939
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

157
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,206
Well, my agency... We're leaving.
We're going on this stupid retreat

158
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,541
and they like all this video,

159
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,081
-like, bonding crap.
-Oh, yeah. I'm actually...

160
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,843
-I'm not a professional.
-What?

161
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,511
-I'm not a professional. I'm Hud.
-Hug?

162
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,078
No, no, no, Hud.
I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

163
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,489
-We met, like, several times before.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,619
Yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,

165
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,458
-it's probably why I didn't...
-Okay, here. If I move it?

166
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,726
-Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally.
-Yeah.

167
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,596
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.

168
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,763
-Really good to see you. Really good.
-So what have you been up to?

169
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,034
I actually... I'm gonna just go
grab some food,

170
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,336
but good luck with the...

171
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,071
I could still do your
agency's retreat if you wanted...

172
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,946
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

173
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,813
Can someone turn down
the music, please?

174
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,152
Surprise! Surprise!

175
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,457
No, no, no, no, no, no!

176
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,226
How did you guys plan all this?

177
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,768
Easy, you're naive. Let's go.

178
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,393
-Hey. How are you?
-Take this. Take this.

179
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,631
-I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you.
-What's up?

180
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,867
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.

181
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,273
-What's up, man?
-Speech!

182
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,403
-Yeah, speech! Speech!
-Speech! Speech!

183
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,285
-Oh, this is very surprising...
-I hope so.

184
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,013
-Obviously.
-It's a surprise party.

185
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,349
Yeah.

186
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,550
But it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?

187
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,752
It was everyone. It was everyone.

188
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,228
No, thank you, everyone.
Thank you. It's...

189
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:36,165
Oh, it means a lot, so... That's it.
That's all I got. I don't know.

190
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,032
-Have a good time!
-Yeah, party!

191
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,298
Yeah!

192
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:45,805
-Hey, man. Were you surprised?
-Yo. I was, like, not even surprised.

193
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,708
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

194
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,374
I don't know. I would say blase.
Like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.

195
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,920
-No, you're not. Well, congrats.
-No, man, that was awesome, dude.

196
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,454
What are you doing
with the video camera

197
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,579
-by the way?
-I'm documenting the night

198
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,180
so that you can take it
to Japan with you.

199
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,349
Oh, can I watch it every night

200
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,426
-when I get there?
-Jason asked if l...

201
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,516
-Yeah, you could.
-Oh, good.

202
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,427
All right, thank you. Cool.

203
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,960
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

204
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,526
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her.
Why wouldn't she be here?

205
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,317
So how are you
gonna survive without Rob?

206
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,082
-He's like your main dude.
-Yeah, I know.

207
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,747
Hey, how am I gonna
survive without you?

208
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,451
-I don't know. I'm like your main dude.
-Straight up.

209
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,087
-As I make my... I'm not here.
-Hi, Hud.

210
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,292
I'm just documenting. Not here.

211
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,993
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him...

212
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,799
You know what.
No, but when he said Mo Fyir Lydo...

213
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,807
-I love Mo Fyir Lydo.
-I was like, "Really?"

214
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,969
That was wonderful.
But, I mean, it worked out, right?

215
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,480
Beth, hey! You made it.

216
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,209
It doesn't matter, dude, you're here.
All is well.

217
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,375
Oh, no, it's good. It's good.

218
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,080
-Enjoy it. Have fun.
-Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...

219
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,523
-Who is that guy?
-I don't know. He's random.

220
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,149
Here, I'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

221
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,227
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,488
-I missed your surprise.
-Oh, that's okay.

223
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,758
I'm sorry. No, we had cab problems.
I'm really sorry.

224
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,424
-That's fine.
-Decorating's mine.

225
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,628
-No, that's fantastic.
-Rob, this is Travis.

226
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,864
-Hi.
-Hi. Oh, pleasure.

227
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,303
I've heard a lot about you.

228
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,931
-Congratulations, by the way.
-Thank you.

229
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,475
-Vice President. That's fantastic.
-I love your dress.

230
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,908
-Thank you. I love yours.
-Yeah, thank you.

231
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,638
That's really amazing.

232
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,873
-Should we...
-Yeah, there's a buffet.

233
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,915
Hey, I'm documenting the night.
I'm Hud.

234
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,244
-Okay.
-So, there's tons of sake.

235
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,114
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

236
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,517
-Enjoy, everybody.
-It's good to meet you.

237
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,522
-Have a good one, yeah.
-Thanks for coming.

238
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,059
-I think he just said I was cute.
-Are they dating?

239
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,252
Yeah.

240
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,145
-Hey, is everything cool, man?
-Yeah, everything's cool.

241
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,517
Okay, because... I don't know,
because you been over here kind of...

242
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,681
Is that my camera?

243
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,224
I don't know. Your brother gave it to me.

244
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,555
Did you switch the tape?
Because I had a tape in there.

245
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,685
I don't know. Was...

246
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,395
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing...

247
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,524
Tape was in here when I got it. Why?

248
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,135
-Rob, why?
-No, it doesn't matter.

249
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,172
It doesn't... It's stupid.

250
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,572
Okay, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

251
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,804
Like, we haven't been
hanging out or anything.

252
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,077
-Here. Here, man. Come on.
-All right, cool. That's more like it.

253
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,675
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

254
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,955
-What's wrong with you?
-Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

255
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:44,490
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

256
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,755
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

257
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,729
Oh, Hud, I don't know.
It's not a really good time right now.

258
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,924
Come on, he's leaving.

259
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,330
-I mean, can we...
-I know.

260
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,731
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

261
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,202
Isn't there something you wanna say?

262
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,872
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

263
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,841
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
-ls that... Okay.

264
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,435
Cool, thanks.

265
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,805
Okay, let's... Right here? I don't...

266
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,440
-No, we can do it in the kitchen.
-Okay, perfect.

267
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,643
Okay.

268
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,747
Okay.

269
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,220
Rob,

270
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,019
I didn't want to do this on camera.

271
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:31,569
But, I just... I just want you to know
how happy I am for you,

272
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,364
because I know how hard
you've worked for this job

273
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,136
and I know how much it means
to you and...

274
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,641
And I'm really gonna miss you.

275
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,949
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

276
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:56,116
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

277
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,321
-What are you talking about?
-I'm serious. They're right outside.

278
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,126
-Hud! Not now.
-Okay. I'll check it out.

279
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,894
You never even called me, Rob!

280
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,492
You go and bring some guy to my party?

281
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,833
Hold on! You haven't
talked to me in weeks!

282
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,640
-Hud, man! Come on!
-Sorry!

283
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,107
-What? What?
-I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

284
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,043
-But I'm documenting!
-Not this.

285
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,842
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

286
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,780
Lily, if you know,
you have to tell me. Lily.

287
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:19,976
I'm not telling you.

288
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,679
I really should know,
as the guy documenting this.

289
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,777
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

290
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,948
-Okay, fine. We'll go find out.
-I'm positive. I promise.

291
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,923
-We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
-She's in the kitchen.

292
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,927
-What?
-Lil!

293
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,330
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

294
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,489
-No.
-You do, don't you?

295
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,566
-What? No.
-Hud, you're a genius.

296
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,897
-You're dodging the question right now.
-There is nothing to tell you.

297
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:37,991
-Nothing.
-Liar.

298
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,764
Lily, if you know something,
you have to tell us.

299
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,861
-No.
-Look at me.

300
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,066
-Lily.
-I know you. Babe.

301
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,441
Okay, fine, but not on camera.
I'm not telling you on camera.

302
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,807
Okay, that's not a problem.
All right, no problem.

303
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,403
Why would we say anything?

304
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,005
-We won't say anything.
-Rob and Beth slept together.

305
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,777
-Are you serious?
-It happened a few weeks ago.

306
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,352
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

307
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,442
Are you kidding me, Lily?

308
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,181
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me?

309
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,554
-Why wouldn't you tell me?
-Why wouldn't I tell you?

310
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,690
Okay, you guys,
don't ask me where I heard this.

311
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,457
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

312
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,362
-I knew it.
-Are you kidding me?

313
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,457
No, I'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

314
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,191
Hey, Marlena.

315
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,668
-It's me, Hud, from before.
-Hi. Right.

316
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,365
Did you know
that Rob and Beth had sex?

317
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,032
-No.
-Yeah, isn't that crazy?

318
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,200
-They've been friends forever.
-Crazy.

319
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,369
I mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

320
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,937
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

321
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,950
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

322
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,747
-They did. They had sexual intercourse.
-What?

323
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:29,946
-Lily told me.
-No way.

324
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,113
-No, you are so...
-No, I promise.

325
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,212
Why do you make up stuff like that?

326
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,655
-No, I do not. I have a nice car.
-You make shit up.

327
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,624
I didn't say what kind...

328
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,888
Hey.

329
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,137
-Good luck in Japan, Rob.
-Good luck tonight, Travis.

330
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,213
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you all right, man?

331
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,077
-Hey. Come on.
-This is not the time, Hud.

332
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,410
-What is it, man?
-Let him go.

333
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,314
-We should talk to him.
-We're not talking to him.

334
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,613
I could talk to him now.

335
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,347
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

336
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,787
-...have to do something.
-No. Everyone needs to just calm down

337
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,983
-and give him space.
-He's just gonna stay

338
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,787
-locked in his room all night?
-Lily, look at you.

339
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,589
-It's fine, trust me.
-It is not fine.

340
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,288
-It is fine.
-You are his brother.

341
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,731
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

342
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,394
So, how do you wanna do this?
Do you wanna do most of the talking,

343
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,937
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

344
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,973
-You're not doing any talking.
-Okay, cool.

345
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,132
We got to talk.

346
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,231
You don't know
what you're talking about,

347
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,504
-all right?
-Okay, well, then tell me.

348
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,842
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

349
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,177
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

350
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,682
-you totally blew her off.
-I didn't blow her off!

351
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,774
She said you never called her.

352
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,377
Look, I'm leaving, all right?
So what am I supposed to do?

353
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,046
I don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

354
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,558
Look, there's no "together." It's just
her and me, two separate things.

355
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,752
It's better if we just stay friends.

356
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,522
...not that I feel like I'm not
good enough for her!

357
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,564
No, stop, stop!
I didn't say "feel," Rob.

358
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,257
You're not good enough for her.

359
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,200
That's it. That's fact. That's science.

360
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,932
Beth Mclntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.

361
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,033
She's beautiful. She's charming.
And you... I love you,

362
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,374
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douche bag.

363
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,144
And going to Japan is not gonna fix that.
She's crazy about you, bro.

364
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,448
-Like, right now, as you are.
-And you're in love with her.

365
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,216
-But you got to go after her.
-It's not that simple.

366
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,553
-No, it is that simple, Rob.
-Come on, man. Don't be scared.

367
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,820
It's about moments, man.
That's all that...

368
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,192
You got to learn to say,
"Forget the world,"

369
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,822
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

370
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,865
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. What the hell was that?

371
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,668
That scared the shit out of me.

372
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,337
Lil! Lil!

373
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,209
Did you feel that?
It was like an earthquake.

374
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,373
-You guys...
-Lil, where are you?

375
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,212
-What was that?
-What was that?

376
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,808
-Hey. Are you all right?
-Oh, my God.

377
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,250
-Yeah, that was really scary.
-Did you see anything?

378
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,016
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

379
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,250
Guys, look out!

380
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,419
-Okay.
-It was like a bomb.

381
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,552
All right, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

382
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,721
Wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?

383
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,991
-But now, just ypproximytelo...
-Shut up, shut up.

384
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,567
-... 15 minutes after word...
-Guys! Come on.

385
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,102
...of y possible earthquake
in lower Manhattan.

386
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:04,437
Nearby, in New York Harbor, we're
getting word of an oil tanker capsizing

387
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:08,001
in the middle of the harbor
near the Statue of Liberty.

388
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,546
-Once again...
-Dude, that's really close.

389
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,809
-... there's no way to know if and...
-That's really, really close.

390
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,817
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

391
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,387
-I don't know. Maybe.
-J, wanna go to the roof?

392
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,614
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

393
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,917
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

394
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,118
-Yeah, let's go up there.
-I don't think we should.

395
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,592
-No!
-That was really...

396
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,266
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

397
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,268
-It's insane, man.
-Watch your step.

398
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,279
It was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

399
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,009
-Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
-ls this the only lights that went out?

400
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,675
-I think they blew up the trains.
-No, a couple did.

401
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:51,085
-Some stayed on.
-Oh, man. What is going on?

402
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,249
Maybe you should've left town
a little bit earlier, right?

403
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,620
Shut up.

404
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,493
Oh, my God!

405
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,824
No, no, no.

406
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,830
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

407
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,431
Hud. Move. Hud!

408
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,788
Oh, God.

409
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,218
-Rob, you got a set of keys?
-Get out of here!

410
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,887
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

411
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,695
-Did anybody see Jason or not?
-I don't know.

412
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,794
Did anybody see Jason?
Has anybody seen Jason?

413
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,703
-Did anybody see Jason?
-ls he inside?

414
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,139
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

415
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,183
Oh, Jesus Christ!

416
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,550
-Oh, God! Oh, God!
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

417
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,323
Oh, my God!

418
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,696
You gotta take your stuff
and we gotta get out of here, man!

419
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,999
I'm telling you!

420
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,904
-I'm so sorry.
-Where were you?

421
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,445
Hey, did you guys see that?
Did you guys just see that?

422
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,559
Go! Let's go!

423
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,470
-Hey, get down! Get down!
-You all right? You all right?

424
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,043
Yeah, did you guys see that?

425
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,512
-Did you guys see that?
-You all right?

426
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,379
There are people still out there.

427
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,333
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

428
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,092
-Rob.
-What?

429
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,170
-Rob, I saw it!
-What?

430
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,330
-What's he saying?
-It's alive.

431
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,547
Stay down, Lily! Get back!

432
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,518
He's going away now.

433
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,987
-Jason, what are you doing?
-Jason, where are you going?

434
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,725
Lily, just wait.

435
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,098
-Jason, don't go out...
-Jason, don't!

436
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,534
Lily, just wait here!

437
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,662
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

438
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,674
-Jason!
-Rob. Rob!

439
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,496
-Oh, my God. Marlena?
-Oh, God.

440
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,001
Are you okay?
Wait, come here. Come here. Sit down.

441
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,254
It walked right through
that street over there.

442
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,851
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It walked right over my head.

443
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,022
-What?
-That's the sound it's making.

444
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,327
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

445
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,699
-You said it was alive? What was it?
-Who cares what it...

446
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,501
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

447
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,632
Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!

448
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,871
-Well, then rewind it. Rewind it.
-Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it...

449
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,307
It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

450
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,904
Yeah, but I don't even
speak the language.

451
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,449
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

452
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,384
It's Japanese. It's Japanese-hard.

453
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,319
-It'll be fine.
-Do you really think I should go?

454
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,326
-Oh, my God.
-That makes no sense.

455
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,089
-That makes no sense.
-Did you see it?

456
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,324
I don't know what it was, of course!
It was giant.

457
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,832
It was like... Did you see that thing?

458
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,926
-I'm not yelling at you, all right?
-Yes, you are!

459
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,937
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

460
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,473
-Quiet, guys.
-All right. Come on, just shut up!

461
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,271
All right? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

462
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,675
All right? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

463
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,407
-Now.
-Yeah, yeah.

464
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,210
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
I think it's the best plan.

465
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,251
-It's a straight shot to Delancey.
-Just take the Williamsburg.

466
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,320
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

467
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,912
No, no, no, dude. It's so much closer.
It's right here.

468
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,991
-Center Street's like a block away.
-What's going on?

469
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,686
I think we're gonna get out of here.
Is she okay to...

470
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,457
Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

471
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,465
It was eating people.
It was eating everyone.

472
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,301
We gotta go! Go! Let's go!

473
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,727
Okay, come here.

474
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,501
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-I don't think... Don't even look.

475
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,371
-ls anyone's phone working?
-What?

476
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,915
-Hud, is your phone working?
-What?

477
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,577
-No...
-Shit! I left it in the apartment.

478
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,176
-There's no signal.
-You're not getting a signal either?

479
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,619
No, no, come on.

480
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,452
-Hud, come on!
-What? Okay.

481
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,229
It's all right.

482
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,392
Let's go.

483
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,771
We need an lV.

484
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,998
-Calm down, please.
-Let's go, people.

485
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,404
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Excuse me, Officer.

486
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,066
Do you know...
What was that thing? What was it?

487
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,734
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

488
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,678
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

489
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,147
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

490
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,151
Hey, how are you? Is she doing better?

491
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,982
She's okay. She's gonna be fine.

492
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,319
-Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
-Not now, Hud.

493
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,557
Sorry.

494
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,260
Please go in an orderly manner.

495
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,132
Continue moving south
towards Brooklyn.

496
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,866
-Just keep going.
-Yeah, I don't know. It got hit.

497
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,008
Once we get over there,
I'll go to my cousin's house.

498
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,738
She has a condo. She's out of town.

499
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,118
I repeat, do not stop. Keep moving.

500
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,453
There will be instructions
on the Brooklyn side...

501
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:39,628
Get across the bridge.
Move in y quick and orderly fashion.

502
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,398
-You still filming?
-Yeah.

503
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,672
People are gonna wanna know
how it all went down.

504
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,413
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

505
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,039
No, that wouldn't work.

506
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,642
People need to see this, you know?
This is gonna be important.

507
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,312
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

508
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,390
-Beth? Beth?
-Rob!

509
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,318
Beth, I've been trying to reach you.
Are you okay? Hello?

510
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:15,462
Wait a second, you guys!
Look, hey! Lily, stop!

511
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,735
I'm sorry. It's really loud here.
Can you speak up?

512
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:19,997
Lily!

513
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,534
-What?
-Rob got a hold of Beth.

514
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,507
Wait! Jason, wait!

515
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,701
-Rob's got Beth on the phone!
-What'd you say?

516
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,871
-What?
-Hey, y'all, come on.

517
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,573
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

518
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,516
Okay, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, okay?

519
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,816
Where are you?
What do you mean, you can't move?

520
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,757
-What?
-I repeat, no panicking.

521
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,197
Did you see it?

522
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,076
-Jason!
-Can you see anything?

523
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,618
No, I can't get over there!

524
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,915
I can't... I can't see anything!
Can you see it?

525
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,683
Jason!

526
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,850
-Why did you stop?
-Jason!

527
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,950
-What?
-Jason, watch out!

528
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,894
Jason! No, Jason! No!

529
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,335
Jason!

530
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:37,307
-No, no! God! No, Jason! Jason!
-Lily, come on!

531
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,939
Jason! No!

532
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,103
Go, go, go, go!

533
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:58,660
Go, go, go, go!

534
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,329
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop! Turn around
and listen to me right now.

535
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,426
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

536
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,335
-I don't know.
-I mean, it came out of nowhere!

537
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,031
And he was there
and then he was gone!

538
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,110
-My God! Jason! Jason!
-Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

539
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,737
-My God! Jason! Jason!
-Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

540
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:44,178
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.
I am so sorry about your brother.

541
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,719
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Rob?

542
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,220
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

543
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,461
-Rob. Rob, dude.
-We can't stay here.

544
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,899
-We can't.
-Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

545
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,198
Listen to me.
We got... We got to get moving, man.

546
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,828
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

547
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,600
We got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

548
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,141
Okay, we can go to the other side.
We can try and get

549
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,371
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
I don't know, man. I don't know, but...

550
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,938
Dude, we got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

551
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,178
What are we gonna do, Rob?
What are we gonna do?

552
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,781
Do you know? Hey!

553
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,051
Look... Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

554
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,061
-No.
-Rob!

555
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,132
-My battery's dead.
-Yeah, dude, l...

556
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,031
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man. You know?

557
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,296
-Rob! Rob!
-Well, where's he going?

558
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,894
Where are you going?

559
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,633
Oh, God. I'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

560
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,840
Rob! Dude!
I can't take all this running, man!

561
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,846
Hey, Rob.

562
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,346
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

563
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,684
-Rob, Rob!
-...burning right now.

564
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,757
The bridge was filled
with pedestrians travelling across.

565
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,089
-It has collapsed.
-Holy shit.

566
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,220
No word on injuries out, but...

567
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,532
Oh, God.

568
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,565
We continue now with our breaking
news story in lower Manhattan.

569
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,473
We are getting some truly extraordinary
live images here in the studio.

570
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,771
For those of you just joining us,

571
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,473
Lower Manhattan is
in an absolute state of siege

572
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,173
in what has been...

573
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,714
This is y mandatory evacuation.

574
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,225
Proceed south immediately.

575
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,592
Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.

576
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:44,532
This is y mandatory evacuation!
We need everyone out of this area now!

577
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,967
Rob? Rob! Hey, dude!

578
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,163
Actually, I think we need to get out
of here, like, right now!

579
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,433
Do you know what I'm saying?
Because there's some

580
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,941
serious shit going on outside!
Rob? No, like, you know what I mean?

581
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,979
Rob, like, there's some strange
shit going on! Rob?

582
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,509
Donny Martel is near the scene
at City Hall.

583
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,810
What's going on?

584
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,852
Can you tell us what it looks like
on the ground there?

585
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,184
Well, Bob, the military will not
let us get too close,

586
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,726
but from what we can see,
there's clearly a sizable mobilization

587
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,088
of troops and equipment,

588
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,059
and they’re trying to get everyone
to leave the area...

589
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,256
To be honest, Tom, our guess
is as good as mine at this point.

590
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,629
There appears to be
something coming off of it.

591
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,895
And the ground seems
to be covered in debris...

592
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,630
It looks like there's something
falling of it, doesn't it?

593
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,467
Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.

594
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,837
There are pieces falling
all over the street.

595
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,706
-Oh, my God.
- Whatever they are, they are moving.

596
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,800
-Oh, mo God! They’re...
-Donny!

597
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:28,970
- They’re right there!
-Oh, shit.

598
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,048
-Donny, can you hear us?
-Hey!

599
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,208
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here! Where is he?

600
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,307
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

601
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,613
-Rob! Rob!
-I've been trying to do that!

602
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,483
Rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?

603
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,318
-The military's evacuating everyone.
-Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

604
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,517
We gotta get out of here.

605
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,026
-It's time to leave the electronics store.
-Rob, come on. We got to go.

606
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,390
-Just come on. Let's go...
-Just stop it!

607
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,020
Okay? Stop, wait!

608
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,165
To listen to our messages...

609
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:58,267
Rob! Rob! I can’t...
Oh, God! I can’t move.

610
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,606
It fell. Mo apartment...
The whole wall fell on me!

611
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,985
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding. I can’t move.

612
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,081
Oh, mo God.

613
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,586
Help me, Rob.

614
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,060
To delete this message...

615
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,244
Rob, wait up! Rob!

616
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,772
I got your message,
and I'm on my way there, okay?

617
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,349
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

618
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,817
Okay? Beth lives in Midtown.
Midtown is that way.

619
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,148
-Guess what else is that way?
-Will you wait up?

620
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,621
-Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
-This is insane, okay?

621
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,589
We're not gonna go
near that thing, okay?

622
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,456
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

623
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,188
No, we're not.
You're not coming with me.

624
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,093
Look. Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

625
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,529
Let them escort you out of here.

626
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,725
Okay?

627
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,064
-Rob!
-I'm sorry. I got to go.

628
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,660
Rob!

629
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,899
-Rob! Listen!
-Rob, wait a minute!

630
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,599
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

631
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,234
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

632
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,676
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

633
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,307
Look at me. This is not me crazy.
All right? I know what I'm doing.

634
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,441
And you can't talk me out of it.

635
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,042
-So turn around, go...
-I'm coming.

636
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:17,055
I'm coming with you.

637
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,579
I'm coming with you.

638
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,686
Lily, you don't have to do that.

639
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,886
-No, I want to. I'm coming.
-Guys, did you not hear her message?

640
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,758
I mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there's a chance

641
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,694
-that she's already...
-Shut up.

642
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:33,897
Guys, this is insane.

643
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,565
-Rob!
-You know what I'm talking about, right?

644
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,936
You can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.

645
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,134
Rob! Rob!

646
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,211
-Rob!
-Hey... Hold...

647
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,840
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

648
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,817
Yeah, but I don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

649
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,945
Look, I'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.

650
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,545
-Hud!
-I'm so sorry.

651
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,181
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

652
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,260
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 91 1,

653
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,089
-see if somebody else can get there?
-Yeah, I tried!

654
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,528
Okay, well. I mean, what about police?
Fire department?

655
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,725
-I couldn't get through! I tried, l...
-Okay, it just seems a little...

656
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,161
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my God!

657
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,600
Oh! Oh, my God.

658
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,410
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

659
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:52,105
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!

660
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,949
-Hud! We're gonna go this way!
-I can't hear you!

661
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,824
-Subway!
-What? What?

662
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,759
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
-Come on! Come on!

663
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,130
This shit is crazy, dude!

664
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,569
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

665
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,412
Hud! Hud!

666
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,453
Are you okay, man? You all right?

667
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,921
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.
-Come on.

668
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,482
-Okay. Okay. Oh, God damn.
-Oh, shit.

669
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,364
What the hell was that?

670
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,099
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
-Did you see that?

671
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,939
-Oh, my God. Oh, God.
-Did you see that?

672
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,656
Okay.

673
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,697
Hey, look. We can just cross...
We can just cross to the other platform,

674
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,795
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street...

675
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,067
Rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!

676
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,109
We can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!

677
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,144
Rob, the air caught on fire!
Okay? There's not gonna be a lull!

678
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,508
But if we wait on the other...

679
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,344
Listen to me, man,
I am with you, okay? I really, really am.

680
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,908
I'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.

681
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,949
-We can't...
-Rob, he's right, okay?

682
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,456
We have to wait. We have to wait.

683
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,919
This is insane.

684
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,094
Shit!

685
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:14,052
-Oh, God.
-What? Rob, what?

686
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,690
Hey, Mom.

687
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,866
Yeah, no. I'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.

688
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,698
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

689
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,900
We're being evacuated, so don't worry.
Okay, but Mom... Mom, listen.

690
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:37,939
We tried to get out of the city,
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

691
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,243
and we were right there when it hit.

692
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,979
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.

693
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,513
I don't know what to say to him.

694
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,318
You know?

695
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,351
Like, I feel like I should say something,

696
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,688
but I don't know what to say.

697
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,413
I'm not even supposed to be here.

698
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,648
You didn't have to be. I mean,

699
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,715
you had your chance in the alley.

700
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,089
You could've left us.

701
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:38,301
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

702
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,728
Yeah.

703
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,037
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,068
-This isn't a bad idea.
-Just walk.

705
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,444
-Wait, so then...
-What's going on?

706
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,016
I don't know.

707
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,486
-...just go across here.
-That's good.

708
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,492
Yeah. This is the six.

709
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,255
Rob, I don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

710
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,421
-No, we can just walk the track, see?
-Yeah.

711
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,998
Look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

712
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,761
We can just walk down the six
to Lexington and then walk down

713
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,871
-Central Park South.
-You want us to walk in the tunnels?

714
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,167
It's either that or stay here.

715
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,110
I'll walk the tunnels.

716
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,482
I can't see.

717
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,889
-It's kind of freaking me out, you know?
-I think there's a light on the camera.

718
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,483
-Let me see.
-There is?

719
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,961
Yeah, right here. See?

720
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,394
Okay.

721
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,047
Ocean is big, dude.

722
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,942
All I'm saying is a couple of years ago,

723
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,044
they found a fish in Madagascar
that they thought

724
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,146
-had been extinct for centuries.
-So what?

725
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,158
It's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?

726
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,320
Sure. Maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?

727
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,865
Or a crevasse. Crevice.
It's just a theory.

728
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,958
I mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.

729
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,663
-Like Superman?
-Yeah, exactly like...

730
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,899
Wait. You know who Superman is?

731
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,637
Oh, my God.
You know who Superman is?

732
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,339
-Okay, I'm not...
-I'm, like, feeling something.

733
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,415
-Are you aware of Garfield?
-A lot of people think

734
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,108
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

735
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,550
I just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing I said to her was,

736
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,747
"Good luck tonight, Travis."

737
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,621
She knows you didn't mean that.

738
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,562
When I think of some of the things
I said to Jason...

739
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,826
-No, that's different.
-Why?

740
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,927
Jason knew you loved him.

741
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,883
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy

742
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,079
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?

743
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,678
-Jesus, Hud.
-What?

744
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,554
It's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

745
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,819
Right.

746
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,626
I just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

747
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:24,928
-came out of the dark right now.
-Hud, seriously.

748
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,094
-Seriously.
-I'm just saying. Sorry.

749
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,777
-What was that?
-Let's just keep moving.

750
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,141
-What was that?
-Let's just keep moving.

751
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,113
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

752
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,411
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

753
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,480
This is disgusting.

754
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,419
They're all running
in the same direction.

755
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,356
-Yeah, like they're running away.
-From what?

756
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,965
Hey, how much farther?

757
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,900
I don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

758
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,370
-Okay?
-Yeah.

759
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,503
Did you guys hear that?

760
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,502
-What is that?
-Just listen.

761
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,248
I don't see anything. Do you guys?

762
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,381
-Oh, man, this is the worst.
-Will you be quiet for five seconds?

763
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,856
-Oh, turn on the night vision.
-What?

764
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,256
-What do you mean?
-It's right here.

765
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,988
I got it. It's right here. There.

766
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,426
Is it on?

767
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,900
-Oh, shit.
-What? What?

768
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,096
-Run. Okay, run. Okay, run.
-What?

769
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,730
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

770
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:42,335
Start running now! Run, run, run!
Run! Just run!

771
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,277
-Lily!
-You guys!

772
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,249
Wait.

773
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,382
Oh, God! Help!
Please help! You guys, help!

774
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,567
Marlena! Here!

775
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,572
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

776
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,340
Hud!

777
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,060
-...there you go.
-Totally not what I was thinking...

778
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,685
-...there you go.
-Totally not what I was thinking...

779
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,633
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

780
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,235
You okay?

781
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,313
You tell me.

782
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,809
How does it look?

783
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,583
Looks like it hurts.

784
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,024
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?

785
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,093
A little bit.

786
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:15,099
-Here. Here, here. You can wash it off.
-Thanks.

787
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,333
Here. Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

788
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,137
No, it didn't get me.

789
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,542
Okay. Okay.

790
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,378
Hey. Hey.

791
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,044
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

792
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,089
-Yeah.
-Oh, man.

793
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,621
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

794
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,195
What's up with that?

795
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,496
-Maybe it liked you, Hud.
-Yeah.

796
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,764
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

797
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:57,744
Hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?

798
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,684
What? You think that I'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?

799
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:06,313
No. No. I know you aren't.

800
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:11,619
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.

801
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,763
Otherwise,
I would have been totally dead.

802
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,896
Right?

803
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,632
It's okay. You just got bit.

804
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:25,964
Hey.

805
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,436
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

806
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,882
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, I guess,

807
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,042
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

808
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,052
-Yeah, okay. What's the next option?
-Well.

809
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,884
Okay, we could see
what's out through this way.

810
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:43,016
-Maybe find another tunnel.
-No, no more tunnels.

811
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,089
Then, I don't know.
We try our luck up top.

812
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,759
Okay, just to be clear,
so our options are

813
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:56,431
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. Is that...

814
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,735
-Yeah, pretty much.
-...pretty much the summing up of it?

815
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,275
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

816
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,575
So, let's just go up and look around.
See if we recognize anything.

817
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,079
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

818
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,618
-No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Here, I'll help you.

819
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:33,635
-We're at 59th.
-We're at 59th.

820
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,473
-Yeah.
-We're at 59th.

821
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,958
That's weird.

822
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,020
What?

823
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,226
Yeah.

824
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,684
Hello!

825
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,533
Marlena?

826
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,997
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

827
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,207
I'm really... I'm dizzy.

828
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,039
Yeah. Do you wanna
sit down for a second?

829
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,246
-No, I'm fine.
-She needs a doctor.

830
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,443
-You sure?
-I'm totally fine.

831
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,951
You know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.

832
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,020
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

833
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,646
We've got civilians!
Are there any more of you?

834
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,054
-No, just us four.
-It's just us.

835
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,648
We got four civilians here.

836
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,125
-Okay, bring them in.
-Roger.

837
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,424
-Let's go, move. Move it.
-Okay, okay.

838
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,767
-Let's go!
-Okay, okay.

839
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,566
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

840
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,200
Listen, we need your help.
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

841
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,835
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

842
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,311
That is not
where you wanna be right now.

843
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,016
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

844
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:19,812
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

845
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,283
If they know, they ain't telling me.
Whatever it is, it's winning.

846
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,220
-What's up?
-We got another bite here.

847
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,092
Don't look at that. Gross.

848
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,864
-Please, we can't stay here. We have...
-Hey, not now.

849
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,405
-Copy that.
-Sir, we have two F-1 8s

850
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,099
on route from Selfridge.
Four more are arming up,

851
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,699
-maybe 30 minutes out.
-Roger that.

852
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,746
Listen up, people.
Rack them and pack them.

853
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,008
-We're phantoms in 15.
-Sir.

854
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,981
-Where the hell did you find them?
-They were in the tunnels.

855
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,110
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

856
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,552
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

857
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,647
-Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
-No, wait. Wait.

858
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,020
-Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
-Move it.

859
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,115
-Move. Move.
-We have to get to her.

860
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,524
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

861
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,097
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

862
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:09,824
Turn that goddamned camera...

863
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,269
-We've been trying to get to her all...
-Make our own way.

864
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,931
-No, do you have a...
-I am not jeopardizing this operation,

865
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,371
-or my men.
-I don't want your help.

866
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,908
You are getting on that chopper now.

867
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,341
I just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.

868
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,572
-You have no idea what's out there.
-I don't care what's out there.

869
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,647
Listen to me. She's dying.

870
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,908
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

871
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,416
The girl that I love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

872
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,180
She should have been with me tonight,
and I let her go and...

873
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,256
And I get it, okay?
You have your hands full. I get that.

874
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,223
I get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,

875
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,658
-then you're gonna have to shoot me.
-Hud.

876
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,260
-I don't feel so good.
-Oh, shit.

877
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:45,300
-Bite! We've got a bite!
-Marlena.

878
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,562
-Hold on a second.
-Get her moving.

879
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,728
Keep moving!

880
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,931
Hey, Marlena, are you okay?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

881
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,940
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

882
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,771
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

883
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,902
-Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
-Let me go.

884
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,274
-Just wait a second. Please.
-Let me go.

885
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,870
-Wait! Marlena!
-Get out of the way.

886
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,711
Marlena! Hold on a second!

887
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,115
-Just wait a... Let go of me! Stop it!
-No.

888
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:10,349
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

889
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,688
Wait a second.

890
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,193
It's over. There is nothing you can do.

891
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:25,400
There is nothing you can do
for her now. It is over. It's over.

892
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,003
-Rogers, clear out of here.
-You sure?

893
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,137
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

894
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,773
-Let's move out.
-Oh, my God.

895
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,685
What just happened?

896
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,088
Let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.

897
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,285
-Come on. Come on.
-Okay.

898
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,419
-Let's go. Move.
-Okay, okay.

899
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,929
Let's go, move. Come on.

900
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,998
You gotta listen to me.

901
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:57,300
This girl, her building,
it's at Columbus Circle?

902
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,205
-Yeah?
-lf you wanna go out in this,

903
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,574
I ain't gonna stop you.
But you gotta know something.

904
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,011
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

905
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,946
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

906
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,678
-You mean Midtown?
-No, I mean Manhattan.

907
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:12,755
Come on. We're taking
one last shot at this thing.

908
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,823
-Oh, God.
-lf that doesn't work,

909
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,620
they're leveling
the whole goddamned city.

910
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,994
-Your watch is still working?
-Yeah?

911
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,689
All right. The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

912
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,460
Last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.

913
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,369
If you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

914
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,166
-Okay. Okay, thank you.
-58th Street's right there.

915
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,036
-Now, go. Move, move, move.
-Let's go.

916
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,302
-Let's go.
-Go, go, go.

917
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,711
-This is like a nightmare, you know.
-It all happened so fast,

918
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,715
I couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

919
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,785
I mean, did you see it?
Could you see what happened, Hud?

920
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,720
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.

921
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,121
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
And then...

922
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,726
Hud.

923
00:53:56,066 --> 00:54:00,298
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

924
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,871
Look, guys, I don't mean to be...
But we don't have a lot of time.

925
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,969
Okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and I'll go.

926
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,377
All right?

927
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:16,076
-I'm sorry. I just...
-No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

928
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,312
Are you sure?

929
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,980
No, no, man.
No, we have to do this, okay?

930
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,558
We're with you. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go right now.

931
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,364
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-What?

932
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,909
-Oh, my God.
-What is it? What?

933
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,776
-Shit.
-That's not Beth's place, is it?

934
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,815
-Oh, my God.
-ls that Beth's apartment?

935
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:50,317
-Oh, my God.
-Rob. Is that her place?

936
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,616
-Tell me that's not her place.
-That's her place, yeah.

937
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:58,688
Oh, shit. I don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.

938
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,955
No, 39th.

939
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,758
-Oh, great.
-How do we even get up there?

940
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:05,824
I don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

941
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,730
I don't know if I can do that.

942
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,831
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

943
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,672
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.

944
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,942
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

945
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,483
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

946
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,020
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

947
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,076
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

948
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:29,750
No one ever listens to me, ever.
And now, of course, they listen to me.

949
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:30,848
Great.

950
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,427
Shit. Shit.

951
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,665
Probably not working.

952
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,132
-What's going on?
-Not working.

953
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,533
Wait, wait. Let's just... Maybe...

954
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,597
-No? No?
-Shit.

955
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,268
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

956
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,638
You guys see that guy's face
when Lily asked him what it was?

957
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,842
I mean, they have no idea.

958
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:00,814
-Unless they're, like, in on it.
-Jesus, Hud.

959
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,255
I don't read the papers.

960
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,020
-Maybe our government made this thing.
-Oh, yeah.

961
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,788
I mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,

962
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,226
-or maybe it was on purpose...
-Sure, maybe they did.

963
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,161
-Does it really matter right now?
-Yeah.

964
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,098
It matters because I need to talk
about something.

965
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:16,904
Otherwise, I'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

966
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:22,745
I'm sorry.

967
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,978
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that?
You guys hear that?

968
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:30,775
-Yes.
-Yeah.

969
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,287
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

970
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,718
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

971
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:37,793
Okay.

972
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,003
Okay, like, I think it's like,
two more up, I think.

973
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,071
Okay.

974
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,568
Guys, guys, guys.

975
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,809
This one, it's got to be.
It's got to be this one.

976
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,916
Oh, God.

977
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,428
I don't think there's anybody here. No.

978
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,334
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh, my God.

979
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,772
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

980
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,842
Okay, now, we can do this.
We can totally do this.

981
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,440
-I don't know, Rob.
-Look, it's a straight shot.

982
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,850
-I don't know. I'm sorry.
-Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

983
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,115
Look, it's a straight shot.
We could use... There's pipes there.

984
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,317
We could use
the air conditioners. Okay?

985
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,923
Come on. We came this far.
We can do it. I'll go first.

986
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:46,996
-Okay, okay, okay. Yes.
-All right? Okay.

987
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:51,055
-Okay, I'll document it.
-Be careful, okay?

988
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:55,228
-Come on. Come on.
-Okay. Okay.

989
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:02,170
Okay. Hud, come on!
Put the camera down! Come on!

990
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,745
Oh, Jesus.

991
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,179
-Okay. All right. Okay.
-I'll go first.

992
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:10,878
All right. If this is the last thing you see,
that means I died.

993
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,477
-Hud, come on!
-Okay.

994
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,003
Look out! Oh, shit...

995
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:27,094
Look out! Oh, shit...

996
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,472
Okay.

997
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,170
-Okay. Okay.
-Shit.

998
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,140
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, God.

999
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,094
-Yes. Okay. You all right?
-Yeah.

1000
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,258
We're almost there, come on.

1001
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,169
Come on, Hud.

1002
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:06,931
Shit.

1003
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:12,273
Beth! Beth! Beth!

1004
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,756
-Can you get it?
-Do you need help?

1005
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,754
Do you need help? Or...

1006
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,032
Beth? Beth?

1007
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,634
Beth?

1008
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:47,241
Beth? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1009
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,783
-What?
-Shit.

1010
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:53,049
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Beth.

1011
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,457
-Beth.
-What?

1012
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,619
Beth!

1013
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,765
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1014
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,642
Can you hear me? Beth.

1015
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,393
Hey.

1016
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,968
-Are you really here?
-Yeah, I'm really here.

1017
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:41,859
Rob?

1018
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,766
You came back for me.

1019
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,938
Of course I came back for you.

1020
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:55,045
-I'm sorry it took me so long.
-No, it's okay.

1021
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,613
Okay, okay, okay. You're okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

1022
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,284
We'll get you out, all right?
Hud, put the camera down

1023
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,157
-and help me, okay?
-Okay, okay.

1024
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:08,655
-It'll be okay.
-Okay, here we go.

1025
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,131
-lf we all just lift at the same time.
-Hold on, okay. We got you.

1026
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,963
-All right? We have to.
-Don't do that, Rob.

1027
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,696
-Please don't do that.
-It's gonna be over in a second.

1028
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:15,862
-All right?
-Okay. Ready, guys?

1029
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,166
-No, please. No.
-Slowly. It's okay.

1030
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,638
We're gonna do it real slow.

1031
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,402
-Easy, easy, just wait.
-No, don't.

1032
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,842
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1033
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,847
Oh, God.

1034
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:34,689
-Okay, now, sit down. Sit down.
-I know. I know. Here.

1035
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,726
I know. I know. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1036
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,125
-You're gonna be fine.
-No, no, no.

1037
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,722
I know, I know, I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

1038
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,601
What is that?

1039
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:51,703
-God.
-It's a terrible thing.

1040
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:53,571
-Okay. We gotta go. We gotta go.
-Okay. Let's go.

1041
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,007
-I got you.
-Oh, God.

1042
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:58,274
-Oh, God.
-All right. All right. Go, go, go.

1043
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,542
-Go.
-Okay. I got you.

1044
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,914
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

1045
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,249
Just hold on to me.
You're gonna be all right.

1046
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,990
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

1047
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,129
-Okay. Hang on to me.
-Oh, my God.

1048
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,632
-Okay, okay.
-Oh, my God.

1049
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:21,595
Okay.

1050
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:25,369
Oh, shit. Man, this is unbelievable.

1051
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,210
-Are you okay?
-Just don't look down, okay?

1052
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,474
-I can't help it.
-You're all right. You're all right.

1053
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,810
Oh, my God.

1054
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,914
Oh, God!

1055
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,449
-Okay, let's go.
-Keep moving, just go.

1056
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,650
Go, just go. Just go, go, go. Go.
Just get to the other side.

1057
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,785
Come on, just keep moving.

1058
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,098
Oh, my God.

1059
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,726
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, my God!

1060
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:56,327
-Oh, my God. Did you see that?
-Okay, come on.

1061
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,566
-Get inside.
-Okay. Come on, come on.

1062
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,608
-Oh, God.
-Go! Go!

1063
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,147
Run! Run! Hurry!

1064
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,352
-Rob, come on!
-Oh, my God.

1065
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,237
Oh, my God.

1066
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,234
-What the hell was that?
-I don't know.

1067
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:36,607
Something else also terrible.

1068
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,837
Rob, what time
do the choppers take off?

1069
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,779
-0600.
-What time is that?

1070
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:43,443
-6:00, Hud.
-Yeah, okay. I knew that.

1071
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,015
-Come on, come on.
-Okay.

1072
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:26,862
Wait up!

1073
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,836
-Did we make it?
-We want to get out of here, come on.

1074
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,435
Let's go! Let's go!

1075
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,708
Keep your heads down.

1076
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,439
Come on! Come on!

1077
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:48,942
You guys are on the next chopper.

1078
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,848
-No!
-Clear this area. Clear this area.

1079
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:53,751
-No, no, wait. Wait.
-Lily!

1080
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,321
We'll be right behind you, okay?

1081
01:04:57,426 --> 01:05:01,328
Wait for us. Wait for us.
We'll be right behind you.

1082
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,092
We're gonna be okay. All right?
We're gonna be all right, you hear me?

1083
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:20,176
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

1084
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,318
Stay low. Stay low.
Come on, come on, come on.

1085
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,127
Thank you.

1086
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:37,825
-They're starting the bomb run.
-Get them out of here. Get going.

1087
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,035
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

1088
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:55,109
Oh, my God.
Are you guys seeing this right now?

1089
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,310
Are you seeing this right now?
Look, look, look.

1090
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:02,983
Are you seeing this shit right now?
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1091
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:11,664
Oh, God.
Those aren't gonna hit us, are they?

1092
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,563
Oh, my God. They hit it!
They just hit it right now!

1093
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:19,163
Look, you guys, they just hit it!
They hit it with... Oh, my God!

1094
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,772
-Yeah, they hit it, you guys! They hit it!
-Oh, he's going down.

1095
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,975
Target down. Target down.
Target down. He's down.

1096
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,879
I think they got him.

1097
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,452
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's the shit right there!

1098
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:34,387
That's what I'm talking about...
Oh, my God! Oh, no, no, no!

1099
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,718
Oh, my God. Oh my God.
God, please, God.

1100
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,889
Please, God. Please.
Please, God and Jesus.

1101
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,626
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

1102
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,259
I'm so sorry, God. Please, no.

1103
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,235
Help me, Rob!

1104
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,705
Rob. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1105
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,901
This is Hawkeye 6. Target still active.

1106
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:23,904
Initiating Hammer Down.
TOT, 15 minutes.

1107
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,208
Sirens will sound two minutes out.

1108
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,106
If you can hear those sirens,
you’re in the blasting zone.

1109
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:35,439
Come on. Come on. Hud.
Hud, are you okay?

1110
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:40,148
-Yeah, all right. I guess. I think so.
-I can't move my arm.

1111
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,554
-This is Duncan-Charlie, return to base.
-Help me, you got to help me.

1112
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,489
-God help us.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

1113
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,220
Come on, help me.

1114
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,629
I know, I know. We're gonna
get you out of here. Come on.

1115
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,928
Hud, come over to the other side.

1116
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,798
You've got to pull him up.
Come on, come on.

1117
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,929
-Okay, okay.
-I don't think I can move.

1118
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,529
Yes, you can. Don't say that.

1119
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,903
Copo our last, we're on the move.

1120
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,670
-Here, take his hand. Take his hand.
-Good luck.

1121
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,371
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I got it.
Come on, come on.

1122
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,180
I got his legs, go!

1123
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:18,518
-My leg!
-I know. I know, I know. I know.

1124
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,959
It's okay, you're fine. You're good.
You're okay. You're okay.

1125
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,462
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding,
okay? Okay?

1126
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:23,896
I'm not okay.
I'm not gonna be able to walk.

1127
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,433
You are going to be able to walk.

1128
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,936
Don't do it.

1129
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,606
Okay. All right, listen,
we got to get out of here, okay?

1130
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:35,836
Well, which way do we go?

1131
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,072
We have to get away from here,
because I think it's gonna explode.

1132
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,013
-Okay, okay. Okay.
-All right? Come on. Let's go.

1133
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,585
Let's go this way. Come on.
Come on, you can walk. Okay.

1134
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,881
Come on. Hold on, wait a second.

1135
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:46,977
-Hud!
-Hud!

1136
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:50,149
What? Oh! Oh, no!

1137
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,251
-Hud! Hud!
-Hud, what are you doing?

1138
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:04,596
Hud!

1139
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,924
Hud!

1140
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:29,422
Hud!

1141
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,634
Hud!

1142
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,926
Hud! Hud!

1143
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,932
Hud! Hud!

1144
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,605
Hud! Hud!

1145
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:43,836
Hud!

1146
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:23,850
He's gone.

1147
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,089
He's gone.

1148
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,324
-They're all gone.
-I know.

1149
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,869
We gotta go. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

1150
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:46,032
Where? There's nowhere to go to.

1151
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,371
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

1152
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:51,503
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

1153
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:54,310
Listen, we wait here,
they'll find us, all right?

1154
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,078
They're fighting him right now.
If we wait here, they'll find us.

1155
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,279
No, we can't stay.

1156
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,687
It's okay. It's okay.

1157
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,927
-I'm so scared.
-I know. I know. I know.

1158
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,923
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1159
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:46,798
It's 6:42 a.m. on Saturday, May 23.

1160
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:51,439
Approximately seven hours ago,
something attacked the city.

1161
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,873
I don't know what it is.

1162
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:57,201
If you found this tape... I mean,
if you're watching this right now,

1163
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,146
then you probably know more
about it than I do.

1164
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:06,049
Whatever it is,
it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

1165
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,215
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,
and Marlena Diamond,

1166
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,122
and many, many others.

1167
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,662
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

1168
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:17,095
The military has begun
bombing the creature

1169
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,258
and we're caught in the middle.

1170
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,259
Okay. Ready?

1171
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,274
It's okay.

1172
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:33,312
-Beth, look at me.
-I don't know what to say.

1173
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,906
Well, just tell them who you are.

1174
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:43,748
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre.
I don't know why this is happening.

1175
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:49,462
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

1176
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,928
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1177
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,412
Look at me, Beth.
Look at me. Look at me.

1178
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,847
-I love you.
-I love you.

1179
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,219
I know what I'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

1180
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:17,986
You are going to miss me
a little bit, right?

1181
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,527
Yeah, we'll see.

1182
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,428
Okay, yeah, all right.

1183
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,897
All right, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

1184
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,126
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

1185
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,361
Last thing to the camera.

1186
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,434
I had a good day.
