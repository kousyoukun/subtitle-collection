1
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,533
It's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,403
Beth's Dad's place.

3
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,046
He's out of town.

4
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,055
And it's already a good day.

5
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,924
Beth.

6
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,664
- Rob, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

7
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,392
- Well, then stop.
- Nothing.

8
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,434
- That's...
- Stop it.

9
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,900
She's shy.

10
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,264
I could just see this
ending up on the Internet.

11
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,934
Well, fine, cover up. See if I care.

12
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,069
- I'm interested in other things.
- Like what?

13
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,481
Like you.

14
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,355
- Oh, man.
- That was close.

15
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,850
Do it really... I'm scared of it.

16
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,930
- It's only 30 minutes out.
- Shut up. I've never been.

17
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,692
You've never been to Coney Island?

18
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,289
Oh, how have you
never been to Coney Island?

19
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,096
I don't know, I just... I've never been.

20
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,067
Oh, that's... It's so much fun.
I'm taking you. We're going.

21
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,399
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

22
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,598
- Yeah, I can't wait to...
- Give me this.

23
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,935
What are you doing? What?

24
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,771
Oh, all right. Well,
then from the neck up, okay?

25
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,435
That's the only way I consent to this.

26
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,035
Oh, please, Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

27
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,012
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs. Com, have you?

28
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:39,175
- Okay. What else?
- What else, what?

29
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,378
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

30
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,423
- What do you want to do today?
- Lf I answer that...

31
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,921
- All right, is this thing on?
- Look out!

32
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,051
Babe, it's not my camera.

33
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,789
I don't know if it's the on button
or the zoom button.

34
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,524
All right. Here, here, here.
I think I got it. Is this on?

35
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,226
Oh, perfect. And now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

36
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,859
Is that funny?

37
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,562
What time is everybody
starting to show up?

38
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,696
- It's getting late here.
- A couple hours.

39
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,640
- That's why we have to hurry.
- Where are we going?

40
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,906
We're going... We're just going
around the corner to the store!

41
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,205
I want you to go around
with your brother's camera

42
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,180
and get testimonials from everyone.

43
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,616
Why? I mean,
it's not like this is a wedding.

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,848
I know it's not a wedding.
I said like a wedding.

45
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,657
I can't get this.

46
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,192
I don't get... I mean,
I don't understand why I have to do it.

47
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,956
'Cause, I mean, I don't...
I don't even know how to work this...

48
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,190
- That's what I think is gonna happen.
- No, I'm not!

49
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,596
- You totally are. You...
- You have no clue!

50
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,725
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

51
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,168
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

52
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,898
Yeah. Got you.

53
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,600
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

54
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,971
You're doing a great job.

55
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,409
Here, practice doing two things at once.

56
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,378
- That's good! That was good.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,506
I'm not lugging this thing around

58
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,605
- all night long.
- He is your brother.

59
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,775
This is important. Stop freaking out.

60
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:46,874
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

61
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,681
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

62
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,983
Jason, I have been planning this
for two weeks!

63
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,580
- All I want you to do is help me.
- Okay, babe, babe.

64
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,559
Okay. All right? I'll do it. It's fine.

65
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,261
I really pissed her off.

66
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,366
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

67
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,493
Hud? Hud, listen to me.
I got a job for you.

68
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,198
I already have got a job.

69
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,433
- I'm doing the sign, so...
- Yeah, no. I see that,

70
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,568
but this is more important than the sign.
You know how, like, at weddings,

71
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:15,010
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?

72
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,274
No.

73
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,449
All right. You're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party

74
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,350
and film people wishing Rob good luck.

75
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,479
I don't know, man.

76
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,886
- That's a lot of responsibility.
- This is important.

77
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,980
And then you have
to do it the whole night...

78
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,083
And Marlena's gonna be here.

79
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,218
- She is?
- Oh, yeah. She is.

80
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,556
- So you're gonna take that.
- Oh, hold on.

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,925
- And you're gonna talk to her...
- I didn't...

82
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,726
- For Rob.
- I didn't say I would do it.

83
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,925
- Just try it out.
- All right, I'll do a few.

84
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,127
You can, just do mine...

85
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,362
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go.

86
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,836
All right.

87
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,134
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

88
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,369
Best of luck in Japan.
I love you so much,

89
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,708
and I'm proud of you.

90
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,379
- That's it.
- That's it?

91
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,614
- Yeah. Easy enough.
- Yeah. It's actually kind of fun.

92
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,048
- You enjoy it, Hud.
- Thanks, man.

93
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,216
Yeah, I'm doing...

94
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,753
Hey, what's up, man?

95
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,625
Hey, guys? Hey.

96
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,654
- What do we say?
- Anything.

97
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,133
Bon voyage, Rob.
Or however you say that in Japanese.

98
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,506
Yeah, good.
Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah...

99
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,871
- Hud, what are you doing?
- I'm documenting the night.

100
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,705
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

101
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,247
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,
so I've been doing it.

102
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,474
I've been doing it really well.

103
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,845
Well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?

104
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,316
Because it's really important.

105
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,683
No, of course. I've been taking it
really, really seriously.

106
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,812
- Very seriously.
- You promise?

107
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,584
Yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?

108
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,322
- Okay.
- Yeah, do it right now.

109
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,416
Okay.

110
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,086
Okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be

111
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,998
- the last thing he sees you...
- Okay, Hud, I got it.

112
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:39,327
- The last thing he sees you...
- Okay, Hud, I got it.

113
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,161
Robert Hawkins,

114
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,464
I can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

115
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,529
Oh! Easy, easy. I mean
I'm obviously standing right here...

116
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,474
And I know we're not officially family,
yet, but...

117
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,238
- Not fair, 'cause I'm gonna...
- Dude.

118
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,507
- Okay.
- I'll cut him out later.

119
00:06:55,615 --> 00:07:00,643
But I think of you as my brother,
and I hope you think of me as a sister.

120
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,085
So, you better call us.

121
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,753
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so...

122
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,760
- Hud?
- Yeah.

123
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,591
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

124
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,664
- That was good!
- That's it?

125
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,754
I thought that was really, really good.

126
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,857
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for...

127
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,114
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

128
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,316
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.

129
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,059
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up, dude?

130
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,253
What's up?

131
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,195
Excuse me! Hey, Marlena?

132
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,237
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi. Hi.

133
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,965
Hey, did you know that I'm going around

134
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,633
the party and I'm...
Do you know Rob's leaving?

135
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,040
- Like it's his going-away party.
- Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:04,412
Cool. Hey, so we're taping,
I think, people talking about him.

137
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,247
Oh, no, thank you.
I barely even know Rob.

138
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,719
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

139
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,255
if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

140
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,190
Okay, cool,
except I'm supposed to get everybody.

141
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,194
So have you ever been to a wedding?

142
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,459
No, I get what you're doing. I just...
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

143
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,865
Okay, cool.
We'll just do a short one real quick.

144
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,137
Okay.

145
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,945
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

146
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,781
I think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

147
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,978
and every one of those times
I was really drunk,

148
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,057
so I don't really even know what to say.

149
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,022
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

150
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,356
- Like you're president of something!
- Vice president!

151
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,895
Also really cool.

152
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,057
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

153
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,499
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

154
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,468
- Cool, that was a really good one.
- Yeah?

155
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,199
Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

156
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,039
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

157
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,306
Well, my agency... We're leaving.
We're going on this stupid retreat

158
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,641
and they like all this video,

159
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,181
- like, bonding crap.
- Oh, yeah. I'm actually...

160
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,943
- I'm not a professional.
- What?

161
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,611
- I'm not a professional. I'm Hud.
- Hug?

162
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,178
No, no, no, Hud.
I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

163
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,589
- We met, like, several times before.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,719
Yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,

165
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,558
- it's probably why I didn't...
- Okay, here. If I move it?

166
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,826
- Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,696
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.

168
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,863
- Really good to see you. Really good.
- So what have you been up to?

169
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,134
I actually... I'm gonna just go
grab some food,

170
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,436
but good luck with the...

171
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,171
I could still do your
agency's retreat if you wanted...

172
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,046
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

173
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,913
Can someone turn down
the music, please?

174
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,252
Surprise! Surprise!

175
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,557
No, no, no, no, no, no!

176
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,326
How did you guys plan all this?

177
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,868
Easy, you're naive. Let's go.

178
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:05,493
- Hey. How are you?
- Take this. Take this.

179
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,731
- I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you.
- What's up?

180
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,967
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.

181
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,373
- What's up, man?
- Speech!

182
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,503
- Yeah, speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

183
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,385
- Oh, this is very surprising...
- I hope so.

184
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,113
- Obviously.
- It's a surprise party.

185
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,449
Yeah.

186
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,650
But it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,852
It was everyone. It was everyone.

188
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,328
No, thank you, everyone.
Thank you. It's...

189
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,265
Oh, it means a lot, so... That's it.
That's all I got. I don't know.

190
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:39,132
- Have a good time!
- Yeah, party!

191
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,398
Yeah!

192
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:45,905
- Hey, man. Were you surprised?
- Yo. I was, like, not even surprised.

193
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,808
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

194
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,474
I don't know. I would say blase.
Like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.

195
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,020
- No, you're not. Well, congrats.
- No, man, that was awesome, dude.

196
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,554
What are you doing
with the video camera

197
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,679
- by the way?
- I'm documenting the night

198
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,280
so that you can take it
to Japan with you.

199
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,449
Oh, can I watch it every night

200
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,526
- when I get there?
- Jason asked if I...

201
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,616
- Yeah, you could.
- Oh, good.

202
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,527
All right, thank you. Cool.

203
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,060
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

204
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,626
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her.
Why wouldn't she be here?

205
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,417
So how are you
gonna survive without Rob?

206
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,182
- He's like your main dude.
- Yeah, I know.

207
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,847
Hey, how am I gonna
survive without you?

208
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,551
- I don't know. I'm like your main dude.
- Straight up.

209
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,187
- As I make my... I'm not here.
- Hi, Hud.

210
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,392
I'm just documenting. Not here.

211
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,093
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him...

212
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,899
You know what.
No, but when he said My Fair Lady...

213
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,907
- I love My Fair Lady.
- I was like, "Really?"

214
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,069
That was wonderful.
But, I mean, it worked out, right?

215
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,580
Beth, hey! You made it.

216
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,309
It doesn't matter, dude, you're here.
All is well.

217
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,475
Oh, no, it's good. It's good.

218
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,180
- Enjoy it. Have fun.
- Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...

219
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,623
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know. He's random.

220
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,249
Here, I'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

221
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,327
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,588
- I missed your surprise.
- Oh, that's okay.

223
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,858
I'm sorry. No, we had cab problems.
I'm really sorry.

224
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,524
- That's fine.
- Decorating's mine.

225
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,728
- No, that's fantastic.
- Rob, this is Travis.

226
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:19,964
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, pleasure.

227
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,403
I've heard a lot about you.

228
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,031
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thank you.

229
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,575
- Vice President. That's fantastic.
- I love your dress.

230
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,008
- Thank you. I love yours.
- Yeah, thank you.

231
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,738
That's really amazing.

232
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,973
- Should we...
- Yeah, there's a buffet.

233
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,015
Hey, I'm documenting the night.
I'm Hud.

234
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,344
- Okay.
- So, there's tons of sake.

235
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,214
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

236
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,617
- Enjoy, everybody.
- It's good to meet you.

237
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,622
- Have a good one, yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

238
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,159
- I think he just said I was cute.
- Are they dating?

239
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,352
Yeah.

240
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,245
- Hey, is everything cool, man?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

241
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,617
Okay, because... I don't know,
because you been over here kind of...

242
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,781
Is that my camera?

243
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,324
I don't know. Your brother gave it to me.

244
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,655
Did you switch the tape?
Because I had a tape in there.

245
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,785
I don't know. Was...

246
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,495
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing...

247
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,624
Tape was in here when I got it. Why?

248
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,235
- Rob, why?
- No, it doesn't matter.

249
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,272
It doesn't... It's stupid.

250
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,672
Okay, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

251
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,904
Like, we haven't been
hanging out or anything.

252
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,177
- Here. Here, man. Come on.
- All right, cool. That's more like it.

253
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,775
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

254
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,055
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

255
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:44,590
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

256
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,855
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

257
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,829
Oh, Hud, I don't know.
It's not a really good time right now.

258
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,024
Come on, he's leaving.

259
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,430
- I mean, can we...
- I know.

260
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,831
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

261
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,302
Isn't there something you wanna say?

262
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,972
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

263
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,941
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Is that... Okay.

264
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,535
Cool, thanks.

265
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,905
Okay, let's... Right here? I don't...

266
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,540
- No, we can do it in the kitchen.
- Okay, perfect.

267
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,743
Okay.

268
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,847
Okay.

269
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,320
Rob,

270
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:25,119
I didn't want to do this on camera.

271
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:31,669
But, I just... I just want you to know
how happy I am for you,

272
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,464
because I know how hard
you've worked for this job

273
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,236
and I know how much it means
to you and...

274
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,741
And I'm really gonna miss you.

275
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,049
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

276
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:56,216
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

277
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,421
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious. They're right outside.

278
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,226
- Hud! Not now.
- Okay. I'll check it out.

279
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,994
You never even called me, Rob!

280
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,592
You go and bring some guy to my party?

281
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,933
Hold on! You haven't
talked to me in weeks!

282
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:08,740
- Hud, man! Come on!
- Sorry!

283
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,207
- What? What?
- I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

284
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,143
- But I'm documenting!
- Not this.

285
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,942
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

286
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,880
Lily, if you know,
you have to tell me. Lily.

287
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,076
I'm not telling you.

288
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,779
I really should know,
as the guy documenting this.

289
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:23,877
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

290
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,048
- Okay, fine. We'll go find out.
- I'm positive. I promise.

291
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,023
- We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
- She's in the kitchen.

292
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,027
- What?
- Lil!

293
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,430
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

294
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,589
- No.
- You do, don't you?

295
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,666
- What? No.
- Hud, you're a genius.

296
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,997
- You're dodging the question right now.
- There is nothing to tell you.

297
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,091
- Nothing.
- Liar.

298
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,864
Lily, if you know something,
you have to tell us.

299
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,961
- No.
- Look at me.

300
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,166
- Lily.
- I know you. Babe.

301
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,541
Okay, fine, but not on camera.
I'm not telling you on camera.

302
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,907
Okay, that's not a problem.
All right, no problem.

303
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,503
Why would we say anything?

304
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,105
- We won't say anything.
- Rob and Beth slept together.

305
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,877
- Are you serious?
- It happened a few weeks ago.

306
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,452
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

307
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,542
Are you kidding me, Lily?

308
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,281
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me?

309
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,654
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
- Why wouldn't I tell you?

310
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,790
Okay, you guys,
don't ask me where I heard this.

311
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,557
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

312
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,462
- I knew it.
- Are you kidding me?

313
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,557
No, I'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

314
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,291
Hey, Marlena.

315
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,768
- It's me, Hud, from before.
- Hi. Right.

316
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,465
Did you know
that Rob and Beth had sex?

317
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,132
- No.
- Yeah, isn't that crazy?

318
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,300
- They've been friends forever.
- Crazy.

319
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,469
I mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

320
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,037
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

321
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,050
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

322
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,847
- They did. They had sexual intercourse.
- What?

323
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,046
- Lily told me.
- No way.

324
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,213
- No, you are so...
- No, I promise.

325
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,312
Why do you make up stuff like that?

326
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,755
- No, I do not. I have a nice car.
- You make shit up.

327
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,724
I didn't say what kind...

328
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,988
Hey.

329
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,237
- Good luck in Japan, Rob.
- Good luck tonight, Travis.

330
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,313
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you all right, man?

331
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,177
- Hey. Come on.
- This is not the time, Hud.

332
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,510
- What is it, man?
- Let him go.

333
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,414
- We should talk to him.
- We're not talking to him.

334
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,713
I could talk to him now.

335
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,447
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

336
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,887
...have to do something.
- No. Everyone needs to just calm down

337
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,083
- and give him space.
- He's just gonna stay

338
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,887
- Iocked in his room all night?
- Lily, look at you.

339
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,689
- It's fine, trust me.
- It is not fine.

340
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,388
- It is fine.
- You are his brother.

341
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,831
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

342
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,494
So, how do you wanna do this?
Do you wanna do most of the talking,

343
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,037
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

344
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,073
- You're not doing any talking.
- Okay, cool.

345
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,232
We got to talk.

346
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,331
You don't know
what you're talking about,

347
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,604
- all right?
- Okay, well, then tell me.

348
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,942
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

349
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,277
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

350
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,782
- you totally blew her off.
- I didn't blow her off!

351
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,874
She said you never called her.

352
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,477
Look, I'm leaving, all right?
So what am I supposed to do?

353
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,146
I don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

354
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,658
Look, there's no "together." It's just
her and me, two separate things.

355
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,852
It's better if we just stay friends.

356
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,622
...not that I feel like I'm not
good enough for her!

357
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,664
No, stop, stop!
I didn't say "feel," Rob.

358
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,357
You're not good enough for her.

359
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,300
That's it. That's fact. That's science.

360
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,032
Beth Mclntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.

361
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,133
She's beautiful. She's charming.
And you... I love you,

362
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,474
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douchebag.

363
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,244
And going to Japan is not gonna fix that.
She's crazy about you, bro.

364
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,548
- Like, right now, as you are.
- And you're in love with her.

365
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,316
- But you got to go after her.
- It's not that simple.

366
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,653
- No, it is that simple, Rob.
- Come on, man. Don't be scared.

367
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,920
It's about moments, man.
That's all that...

368
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,292
You got to learn to say,
"Forget the world,"

369
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,922
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

370
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,965
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. What the hell was that?

371
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,768
That scared the shit out of me.

372
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,437
Lil! Lil!

373
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,309
Did you feel that?
It was like an earthquake.

374
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,473
- You guys...
- Lil, where are you?

375
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,312
- What was that?
- What was that?

376
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,908
- Hey. Are you all right?
- Oh, my God.

377
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,350
- Yeah, that was really scary.
- Did you see anything?

378
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,116
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

379
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,350
Guys, look out!

380
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,519
- Okay.
- It was like a bomb.

381
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,652
All right, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

382
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,821
Wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?

383
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,091
- But now, just approximately...
- Shut up, shut up.

384
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,667
...15 minutes after word...
- Guys! Come on.

385
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,202
...of a possible earthquake
in lower Manhattan.

386
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:04,537
Nearby, in New York Harbor, we're
getting word of an oil tanker capsizing

387
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,101
in the middle of the harbor
near the Statue of Liberty.

388
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,646
- Once again...
- Dude, that's really close.

389
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,909
...there's no way to know if any...
- That's really, really close.

390
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,917
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

391
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,487
- I don't know. Maybe.
- J, wanna go to the roof?

392
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,714
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

393
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,017
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

394
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,218
- Yeah, let's go up there.
- I don't think we should.

395
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,692
- No!
- That was really...

396
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,366
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

397
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,368
- It's insane, man.
- Watch your step.

398
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,379
It was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

399
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,109
- Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
- Is this the only lights that went out?

400
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,775
- I think they blew up the trains.
- No, a couple did.

401
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:51,185
- Some stayed on.
- Oh, man. What is going on?

402
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,349
Maybe you should've left town
a little bit earlier, right?

403
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,720
Shut up.

404
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,593
Oh, my God!

405
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:00,924
No, no, no.

406
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,930
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

407
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,531
Hud. Move. Hud!

408
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,888
Oh, God.

409
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,318
- Rob, you got a set of keys?
- Get out of here!

410
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,987
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

411
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,795
- Did anybody see Jason or not?
- I don't know.

412
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,894
Did anybody see Jason?
Has anybody seen Jason?

413
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,803
- Did anybody see Jason?
- Is he inside?

414
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,239
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

415
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,283
Oh, Jesus Christ!

416
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,650
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

417
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,423
Oh, my God!

418
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,796
You gotta take your stuff
and we gotta get out of here, man!

419
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,099
I'm telling you!

420
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,004
- I'm so sorry.
- Where were you?

421
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,545
Hey, did you guys see that?
Did you guys just see that?

422
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,659
Go! Let's go!

423
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,570
- Hey, get down! Get down!
- You all right? You all right?

424
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:53,143
Yeah, did you guys see that?

425
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,612
- Did you guys see that?
- You all right?

426
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,479
There are people still out there.

427
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,433
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

428
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,192
- Rob.
- What?

429
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,270
- Rob, I saw it!
- What?

430
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,430
- What's he saying?
- It's alive.

431
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,647
Stay down, Lily! Get back!

432
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,618
He's going away now.

433
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,087
- Jason, what are you doing?
- Jason, where are you going?

434
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,825
Lily, just wait.

435
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,198
- Jason, don't go out...
- Jason, don't!

436
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,634
Lily, just wait here!

437
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,762
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

438
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,774
- Jason!
- Rob. Rob!

439
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:21,596
- Oh, my God. Marlena?
- Oh, God.

440
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,101
Are you okay?
Wait, come here. Come here. Sit down.

441
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,354
It walked right through
that street over there.

442
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,951
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It walked right over my head.

443
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,122
- What?
- That's the sound it's making.

444
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,427
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

445
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,799
- You said it was alive? What was it?
- Who cares what it...

446
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:02,601
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

447
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,732
Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!

448
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,971
- Well, then rewind it. Rewind it.
- Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it...

449
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:09,407
It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

450
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,004
Yeah, but I don't even
speak the language.

451
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,549
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

452
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,484
It's Japanese. It's Japanese-hard.

453
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,419
- It'll be fine.
- Do you really think I should go?

454
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,426
- Oh, my God.
- That makes no sense.

455
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,189
- That makes no sense.
- Did you see it?

456
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,424
I don't know what it was, of course!
It was giant.

457
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,932
It was like... Did you see that thing?

458
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,026
- I'm not yelling at you, all right?
- Yes, you are!

459
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,037
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

460
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,573
- Quiet, guys.
- All right. Come on, just shut up!

461
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,371
All right? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

462
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,775
All right? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

463
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,507
- Now.
- Yeah, yeah.

464
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,310
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
I think it's the best plan.

465
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,351
- It's a straight shot to Delancey.
- Just take the Williamsburg.

466
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,420
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

467
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,012
No, no, no, dude. It's so much closer.
It's right here.

468
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,091
- Center Street's like a block away.
- What's going on?

469
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,786
I think we're gonna get out of here.
Is she okay to...

470
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,557
Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

471
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,565
It was eating people.
It was eating everyone.

472
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,401
We gotta go! Go! Let's go!

473
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,827
Okay, come here.

474
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,601
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- I don't think... Don't even look.

475
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,471
- Is anyone's phone working?
- What?

476
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,015
- Hud, is your phone working?
- What?

477
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,677
- No...
- Shit! I left it in the apartment.

478
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,276
- There's no signal.
- You're not getting a signal either?

479
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,719
No, no, come on.

480
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,552
- Hud, come on!
- What? Okay.

481
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,329
It's all right.

482
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,492
Let's go.

483
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:40,871
We need an IV.

484
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,098
- Calm down, please.
- Let's go, people.

485
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,504
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Excuse me, Officer.

486
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,166
Do you know...
What was that thing? What was it?

487
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:46,834
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

488
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,778
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

489
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,247
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

490
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,251
Hey, how are you? Is she doing better?

491
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,082
She's okay. She's gonna be fine.

492
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,419
- Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
- Not now, Hud.

493
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,657
Sorry.

494
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,360
Please go in an orderly manner.

495
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,232
Continue moving south
towards Brooklyn.

496
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,966
- Just keep going.
- Yeah, I don't know. It got hit.

497
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,108
Once we get over there,
I'll go to my cousin's house.

498
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,838
She has a condo. She's out of town.

499
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:30,218
I repeat, do not stop. Keep moving.

500
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,553
There will be instructions
on the Brooklyn side...

501
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:39,728
Get across the bridge.
Move in a quick and orderly fashion.

502
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,498
- You still filming?
- Yeah.

503
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,772
People are gonna wanna know
how it all went down.

504
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,513
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

505
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,139
No, that wouldn't work.

506
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,742
People need to see this, you know?
This is gonna be important.

507
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,412
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

508
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,490
- Beth? Beth?
- Rob!

509
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,418
Beth, I've been trying to reach you.
Are you okay? Hello?

510
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,562
Wait a second, you guys!
Look, hey! Lily, stop!

511
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,835
I'm sorry. It's really loud here.
Can you speak up?

512
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,097
Lily!

513
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,634
- What?
- Rob got a hold of Beth.

514
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,607
Wait! Jason, wait!

515
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,801
- Rob's got Beth on the phone!
- What'd you say?

516
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,971
- What?
- Hey, y'all, come on.

517
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,673
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

518
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,616
Okay, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, okay?

519
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,916
Where are you?
What do you mean, you can't move?

520
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,857
- What?
- I repeat, no panicking.

521
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,297
Did you see it?

522
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,176
- Jason!
- Can you see anything?

523
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,718
No, I can't get over there!

524
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,015
I can't... I can't see anything!
Can you see it?

525
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,783
Jason!

526
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,950
- Why did you stop?
- Jason!

527
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,050
- What?
- Jason, watch out!

528
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,994
Jason! No, Jason! No!

529
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,435
Jason!

530
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:37,407
- No, no! God! No, Jason! Jason!
- Lily, come on!

531
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,039
Jason! No!

532
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,203
Go, go, go, go!

533
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:58,760
Go, go, go, go!

534
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,429
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop! Turn around
and listen to me right now.

535
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,526
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

536
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,435
- I don't know.
- I mean, it came out of nowhere!

537
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,131
And he was there
and then he was gone!

538
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,210
- My God! Jason! Jason!
- Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

539
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,837
- My God! Jason! Jason!
- Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

540
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,278
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.
I am so sorry about your brother.

541
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:48,819
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Rob?

542
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:54,320
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

543
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,561
- Rob. Rob, dude.
- We can't stay here.

544
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,999
- We can't.
- Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

545
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,298
Listen to me.
We got... We got to get moving, man.

546
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,928
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

547
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,700
We got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

548
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,241
Okay, we can go to the other side.
We can try and get

549
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,471
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
I don't know, man. I don't know, but...

550
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,038
Dude, we got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

551
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:23,278
What are we gonna do, Rob?
What are we gonna do?

552
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,881
Do you know? Hey!

553
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,151
Look... Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

554
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,161
- No.
- Rob!

555
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,232
- My battery's dead.
- Yeah, dude, I...

556
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,131
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man. You know?

557
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,396
- Rob! Rob!
- Well, where's he going?

558
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,994
Where are you going?

559
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,733
Oh, God. I'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

560
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,940
Rob! Dude!
I can't take all this running, man!

561
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,946
Hey, Rob.

562
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,446
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

563
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,784
- Rob, Rob!
...burning right now.

564
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,857
The bridge was filled
with pedestrians traveling across.

565
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,189
- It has collapsed.
- Holy shit.

566
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,320
No word on injuries yet, but...

567
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,632
Oh, God.

568
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,665
We continue now with our breaking
news story in lower Manhattan.

569
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:19,573
We are getting some truly extraordinary
live images here in the studio.

570
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,871
For those of you just joining us,

571
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,573
lower Manhattan is
in an absolute state of siege

572
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,273
in what has been...

573
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,814
This is a mandatory evacuation.

574
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,325
Proceed south immediately.

575
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,692
Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.

576
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:44,632
This is a mandatory evacuation!
We need everyone out of this area now!

577
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,067
Rob? Rob! Hey, dude!

578
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,263
Actually, I think we need to get out
of here, like, right now!

579
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,533
Do you know what I'm saying?
Because there's some

580
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,041
serious shit going on outside!
Rob? No, like, you know what I mean?

581
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,079
Rob, like, there's some strange
shit going on! Rob?

582
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,609
Donna Martel is near the scene
at City Hall.

583
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,910
What's going on?

584
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,952
Can you tell us what it looks like
on the ground there?

585
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,284
Well, Bob, the military will not
let us get too close,

586
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,826
but from what we can see,
there's clearly a sizable mobilization

587
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,188
of troops and equipment,

588
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:12,159
and they're trying to get everyone
to leave the area...

589
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,356
To be honest, Tom, your guess
is as good as mine at this point.

590
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,729
There appears to be
something coming off of it.

591
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,995
And the ground seems
to be covered in debris...

592
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,730
It looks like there's something
falling of it, doesn't it?

593
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,567
Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.

594
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,937
There are pieces falling
all over the street.

595
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,806
- Oh, my God.
- Whatever they are, they are moving.

596
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:27,900
- Oh, my God! They're...
- Donna!

597
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,070
- They're right there!
- Oh, shit.

598
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,148
- Donna, can you hear us?
- Hey!

599
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,308
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here! Where is he?

600
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,407
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

601
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,713
- Rob! Rob!
- I've been trying to do that!

602
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,583
Rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?

603
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:40,418
- The military's evacuating everyone.
- Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

604
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,617
We gotta get out of here.

605
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,126
- It's time to leave the electronics store.
- Rob, come on. We got to go.

606
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,490
- Just come on. Let's go...
- Just stop it!

607
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,120
Okay? Stop, wait!

608
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,265
To listen to your messages...

609
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:58,367
Rob! Rob! I can't...
Oh, God! I can't move.

610
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,706
It fell. My apartment...
The whole wall fell on me!

611
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:09,085
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding. I can't move.

612
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,181
Oh, my God.

613
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,686
Help me, Rob.

614
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,160
To delete this message...

615
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,344
Rob, wait up! Rob!

616
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:36,872
I got your message,
and I'm on my way there, okay?

617
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,449
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

618
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,917
Okay? Beth lives in Midtown.
Midtown is that way.

619
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,248
- Guess what else is that way?
- Will you wait up?

620
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,721
- Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
- This is insane, okay?

621
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,689
We're not gonna go
near that thing, okay?

622
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,556
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

623
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,288
No, we're not.
You're not coming with me.

624
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:54,193
Look. Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

625
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,629
Let them escort you out of here.

626
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:56,825
Okay?

627
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,164
- Rob!
- I'm sorry. I got to go.

628
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,760
Rob!

629
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,999
- Rob! Listen!
- Rob, wait a minute!

630
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,699
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

631
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,334
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

632
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,776
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

633
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,407
Look at me. This is not me crazy.
All right? I know what I'm doing.

634
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,541
And you can't talk me out of it.

635
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,142
- So turn around, go...
- I'm coming.

636
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:17,155
I'm coming with you.

637
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,679
I'm coming with you.

638
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,786
Lily, you don't have to do that.

639
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,986
- No, I want to. I'm coming.
- Guys, did you not hear her message?

640
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,858
I mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there's a chance

641
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,794
- that she's already...
- Shut up.

642
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:33,997
Guys, this is insane.

643
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,665
- Rob!
- You know what I'm talking about, right?

644
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,036
You can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.

645
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,234
Rob! Rob!

646
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,311
- Rob!
- Hey... Hold...

647
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

648
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,917
Yeah, but I don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

649
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,045
Look, I'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.

650
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,645
- Hud!
- I'm so sorry.

651
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,281
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

652
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,360
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 911,

653
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,189
- see if somebody else can get there?
- Yeah, I tried!

654
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,628
Okay, well. I mean, what about police?
Fire department?

655
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,825
- I couldn't get through! I tried, I...
- Okay, it just seems a little...

656
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,261
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God!

657
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,700
Oh! Oh, my God.

658
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,510
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

659
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:52,205
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!

660
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,049
- Hud! We're gonna go this way!
- I can't hear you!

661
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,924
- Subway!
- What? What?

662
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,859
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Come on! Come on!

663
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,230
This shit is crazy, dude!

664
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,669
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

665
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,512
Hud! Hud!

666
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,553
Are you okay, man? You all right?

667
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,021
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.
- Come on.

668
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,582
- Okay. Okay. Oh, God damn.
- Oh, shit.

669
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,464
What the hell was that?

670
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:51,199
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Did you see that?

671
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,039
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.
- Did you see that?

672
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:13,756
Okay.

673
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,797
Hey, look. We can just cross...
We can just cross to the other platform,

674
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,895
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street...

675
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,167
Rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!

676
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,209
We can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!

677
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,244
Rob, the air caught on fire!
Okay? There's not gonna be a lull!

678
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,608
But if we wait on the other...

679
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,444
Listen to me, man,
I am with you, okay? I really, really am.

680
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,008
I'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.

681
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,049
- We can't...
- Rob, he's right, okay?

682
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,556
We have to wait. We have to wait.

683
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,019
This is insane.

684
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,194
Shit!

685
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,152
- Oh, God.
- What? Rob, what?

686
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:18,790
Hey, Mom.

687
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,966
Yeah, no. I'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.

688
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,798
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

689
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:31,000
We're being evacuated, so don't worry.
Okay, but Mom... Mom, listen.

690
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:38,039
We tried to get out of the city,
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

691
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,343
and we were right there when it hit.

692
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,079
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.

693
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,613
I don't know what to say to him.

694
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,418
You know?

695
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,451
Like, I feel like I should say something,

696
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,788
but I don't know what to say.

697
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:19,513
I'm not even supposed to be here.

698
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,748
You didn't have to be. I mean,

699
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,815
you had your chance in the alley.

700
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,189
You could've left us.

701
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:38,401
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

702
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,828
Yeah.

703
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:44,137
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,168
- This isn't a bad idea.
- Just walk.

705
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,544
- Wait, so then...
- What's going on?

706
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,116
I don't know.

707
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,586
...just go across here.
- That's good.

708
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,592
Yeah. This is the six.

709
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,355
Rob, I don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

710
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,521
- No, we can just walk the track, see?
- Yeah.

711
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,098
Look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

712
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,861
We can just walk down the six
to Lexington and then walk down

713
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,971
- Central Park South.
- You want us to walk in the tunnels?

714
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,267
It's either that or stay here.

715
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,210
I'll walk the tunnels.

716
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,582
I can't see.

717
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,989
- It's kind of freaking me out, you know?
- I think there's a light on the camera.

718
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,583
- Let me see.
- There is?

719
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,061
Yeah, right here. See?

720
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,494
Okay.

721
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,147
Ocean is big, dude.

722
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,042
All I'm saying is a couple of years ago,

723
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,144
they found a fish in Madagascar
that they thought

724
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:07,246
- had been extinct for centuries.
- So what?

725
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,258
It's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?

726
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,420
Sure. Maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?

727
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:15,965
Or a crevasse. Crevice.
It's just a theory.

728
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,058
I mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.

729
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,763
- Like Superman?
- Yeah, exactly like...

730
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,999
Wait. You know who Superman is?

731
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,737
Oh, my God.
You know who Superman is?

732
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,439
- Okay, I'm not...
- I'm, like, feeling something.

733
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,515
- Are you aware of Garfield?
- A lot of people think

734
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,208
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

735
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,650
I just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing I said to her was,

736
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,847
"Good luck tonight, Travis."

737
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,721
She knows you didn't mean that.

738
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,662
When I think of some of the things
I said to Jason...

739
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,926
- No, that's different.
- Why?

740
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,027
Jason knew you loved him.

741
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,983
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy

742
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,179
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?

743
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,778
- Jesus, Hud.
- What?

744
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,654
It's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

745
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,919
Right.

746
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,726
I just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

747
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,028
- came out of the dark right now.
- Hud, seriously.

748
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,194
- Seriously.
- I'm just saying. Sorry.

749
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,877
- What was that?
- Let's just keep moving.

750
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:34,241
- What was that?
- Let's just keep moving.

751
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,213
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

752
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,511
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

753
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,580
This is disgusting.

754
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,519
They're all running
in the same direction.

755
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:49,456
- Yeah, like they're running away.
- From what?

756
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,065
Hey, how much farther?

757
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,000
I don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

758
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,470
- Okay?
- Yeah.

759
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:05,603
Did you guys hear that?

760
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,602
- What is that?
- Just listen.

761
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,348
I don't see anything. Do you guys?

762
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,481
- Oh, man, this is the worst.
- Will you be quiet for five seconds?

763
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,956
- Oh, turn on the night vision.
- What?

764
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,356
- What do you mean?
- It's right here.

765
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,088
I got it. It's right here. There.

766
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,526
Is it on?

767
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,000
- Oh, shit.
- What? What?

768
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,196
- Run. Okay, run. Okay, run.
- What?

769
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,830
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

770
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:42,435
Start running now! Run, run, run!
Run! Just run!

771
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,377
- Lily!
- You guys!

772
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,349
Wait.

773
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,482
Oh, God! Help!
Please help! You guys, help!

774
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,667
Marlena! Here!

775
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,672
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

776
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,440
Hud!

777
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,160
...there you go.
- Totally not what I was thinking...

778
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,785
...there you go.
- Totally not what I was thinking...

779
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,733
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

780
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,335
You okay?

781
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,413
You tell me.

782
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,909
How does it look?

783
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,683
Looks like it hurts.

784
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,124
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?

785
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,193
A little bit.

786
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:15,199
- Here. Here, here. You can wash it off.
- Thanks.

787
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,433
Here. Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

788
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,237
No, it didn't get me.

789
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,642
Okay. Okay.

790
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,478
Hey. Hey.

791
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,144
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

792
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,189
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

793
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,721
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

794
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,295
What's up with that?

795
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,596
- Maybe it liked you, Hud.
- Yeah.

796
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:47,864
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

797
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:57,844
Hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?

798
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,784
What? You think that I'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?

799
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:06,413
No. No. I know you aren't.

800
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,719
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.

801
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,863
Otherwise,
I would have been totally dead.

802
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,996
Right?

803
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,732
It's okay. You just got bit.

804
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,064
Hey.

805
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:30,536
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

806
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,982
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, I guess,

807
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,142
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

808
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,152
- Yeah, okay. What's the next option?
- Well.

809
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,984
Okay, we could see
what's out through this way.

810
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,116
- Maybe find another tunnel.
- No, no more tunnels.

811
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:47,189
Then, I don't know.
We try our luck up top.

812
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,859
Okay, just to be clear,
so our options are

813
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:56,531
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. Is that...

814
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,835
- Yeah, pretty much.
...pretty much the summing up of it?

815
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,375
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

816
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:04,675
So, let's just go up and look around.
See if we recognize anything.

817
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,179
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

818
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,718
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Here, I'll help you.

819
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,735
- We're at 59th.
- We're at 59th.

820
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,573
- Yeah.
- We're at 59th.

821
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,058
That's weird.

822
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,120
What?

823
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,326
Yeah.

824
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:14,784
Hello!

825
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,633
Marlena?

826
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,097
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

827
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,307
I'm really... I'm dizzy.

828
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,139
Yeah. Do you wanna
sit down for a second?

829
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,346
- No, I'm fine.
- She needs a doctor.

830
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,543
- You sure?
- I'm totally fine.

831
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,051
You know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.

832
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,120
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

833
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,746
We've got civilians!
Are there any more of you?

834
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,154
- No, just us four.
- It's just us.

835
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:56,748
We got four civilians here.

836
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,225
- Okay, bring them in.
- Roger.

837
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,524
- Let's go, move. Move it.
- Okay, okay.

838
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,867
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

839
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,666
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

840
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:14,300
Listen, we need your help.
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

841
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,935
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

842
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,411
That is not
where you wanna be right now.

843
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,116
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

844
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:19,912
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

845
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:23,383
If they know, they ain't telling me.
Whatever it is, it's winning.

846
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:34,320
- What's up?
- We got another bite here.

847
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,192
Don't look at that. Gross.

848
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,964
- Please, we can't stay here. We have...
- Hey, not now.

849
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,505
- Copy that.
- Sir, we have two F-18s

850
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,199
on route from Selfridge.
Four more are arming up,

851
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,799
- maybe 30 minutes out.
- Roger that.

852
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,846
Listen up, people.
Rack them and pack them.

853
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,108
- We're phantoms in 15.
- Sir.

854
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,081
- Where the hell did you find them?
- They were in the tunnels.

855
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,210
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

856
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,652
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

857
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,747
- Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
- No, wait. Wait.

858
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,120
- Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
- Move it.

859
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,215
- Move. Move.
- We have to get to her.

860
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,624
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

861
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,197
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

862
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:09,924
Turn that goddamned camera...

863
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,369
- We've been trying to get to her all...
- Make our own way.

864
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:17,031
- No, do you have a...
- I am not jeopardizing this operation,

865
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,471
- or my men.
- I don't want your help.

866
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,008
You are getting on that chopper now.

867
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,441
I just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.

868
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,672
- You have no idea what's out there.
- I don't care what's out there.

869
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,747
Listen to me. She's dying.

870
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,008
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

871
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,516
The girl that I love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

872
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,280
She should have been with me tonight,
and I let her go and...

873
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,356
And I get it, okay?
You have your hands full. I get that.

874
00:51:33,456 --> 00:51:36,323
I get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,

875
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,758
- then you're gonna have to shoot me.
- Hud.

876
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,360
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, shit.

877
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:45,400
- Bite! We've got a bite!
- Marlena.

878
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:46,662
- Hold on a second.
- Get her moving.

879
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,828
Keep moving!

880
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,031
Hey, Marlena, are you okay?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

881
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,040
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

882
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,871
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

883
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,002
- Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
- Let me go.

884
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,374
- Just wait a second. Please.
- Let me go.

885
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,970
- Wait! Marlena!
- Get out of the way.

886
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,811
Marlena! Hold on a second!

887
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,215
- Just wait a... Let go of me! Stop it!
- No.

888
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,449
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

889
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,788
Wait a second.

890
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,293
It's over. There is nothing you can do.

891
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:25,500
There is nothing you can do
for her now. It is over. It's over.

892
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,103
- Rogers, clear out of here.
- You sure?

893
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,237
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

894
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,873
- Let's move out.
- Oh, my God.

895
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,785
What just happened?

896
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,188
Let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.

897
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,385
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

898
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,519
- Let's go. Move.
- Okay, okay.

899
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,029
Let's go, move. Come on.

900
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,098
You gotta listen to me.

901
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,400
This girl, her building,
it's at Columbus Circle?

902
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,305
- Yeah?
- Lf you wanna go out in this,

903
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,674
I ain't gonna stop you.
But you gotta know something.

904
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,111
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

905
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,046
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

906
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,778
- You mean Midtown?
- No, I mean Manhattan.

907
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,855
Come on. We're taking
one last shot at this thing.

908
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:13,923
- Oh, God.
- Lf that doesn't work,

909
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,720
they're leveling
the whole goddamned city.

910
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,094
- Your watch is still working?
- Yeah?

911
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,789
All right. The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

912
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,560
Last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.

913
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,469
If you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

914
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,266
- Okay. Okay, thank you.
- 58th Street's right there.

915
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,136
- Now, go. Move, move, move.
- Let's go.

916
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,402
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

917
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,811
- This is like a nightmare, you know.
- It all happened so fast,

918
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,815
I couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

919
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,885
I mean, did you see it?
Could you see what happened, Hud?

920
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,820
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.

921
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,221
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
And then...

922
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,826
Hud.

923
00:53:56,166 --> 00:54:00,398
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

924
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,971
Look, guys, I don't mean to be...
But we don't have a lot of time.

925
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,069
Okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and I'll go.

926
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,477
All right?

927
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:16,176
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

928
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,412
Are you sure?

929
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,080
No, no, man.
No, we have to do this, okay?

930
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,658
We're with you. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go right now.

931
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,464
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

932
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:41,009
- Oh, my God.
- What is it? What?

933
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,876
- Shit.
- That's not Beth's place, is it?

934
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,915
- Oh, my God.
- Is that Beth's apartment?

935
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:50,417
- Oh, my God.
- Rob. Is that her place?

936
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,716
- Tell me that's not her place.
- That's her place, yeah.

937
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,788
Oh, shit. I don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.

938
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,055
No, 39th.

939
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,858
- Oh, great.
- How do we even get up there?

940
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,924
I don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

941
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,830
I don't know if I can do that.

942
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,931
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

943
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:15,772
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.

944
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:19,042
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

945
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:22,583
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

946
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:24,120
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

947
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:29,850
No one ever listens to me, ever.
And now, of course, they listen to me.

948
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:30,948
Great.

949
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,527
Shit. Shit.

950
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,765
Probably not working.

951
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,232
- What's going on?
- Not working.

952
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,633
Wait, wait. Let's just... Maybe...

953
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:44,697
- No? No?
- Shit.

954
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:47,368
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

955
00:55:49,712 --> 00:55:52,738
You guys see that guy's face
when Lily asked him what it was?

956
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,942
I mean, they have no idea.

957
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,914
- Unless they're, like, in on it.
- Jesus, Hud.

958
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,355
I don't read the papers.

959
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,120
- Maybe our government made this thing.
- Oh, yeah.

960
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,888
I mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,

961
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,326
- or maybe it was on purpose...
- Sure, maybe they did.

962
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,261
- Does it really matter right now?
- Yeah.

963
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,198
It matters because I need to talk
about something.

964
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:17,004
Otherwise, I'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

965
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,845
I'm sorry.

966
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:28,078
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that?
You guys hear that?

967
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:30,875
- Yes.
- Yeah.

968
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,387
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

969
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,818
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

970
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:37,893
Okay.

971
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:48,103
Okay, like, I think it's like,
two more up, I think.

972
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,171
Okay.

973
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,668
Guys, guys, guys.

974
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:54,909
This one, it's got to be.
It's got to be this one.

975
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,016
Oh, God.

976
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,528
I don't think there's anybody here. No.

977
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:26,434
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

978
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,872
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

979
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:33,942
Okay, now, we can do this.
We can totally do this.

980
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,540
- I don't know, Rob.
- Look, it's a straight shot.

981
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,950
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

982
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,215
Look, it's a straight shot.
We could use... There's pipes there.

983
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:43,417
We could use
the air conditioners. Okay?

984
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,023
Come on. We came this far.
We can do it. I'll go first.

985
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,096
- Okay, okay, okay. Yes.
- All right? Okay.

986
00:57:47,196 --> 00:57:51,155
- Okay, I'll document it.
- Be careful, okay?

987
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:55,328
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

988
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,270
Okay. Hud, come on!
Put the camera down! Come on!

989
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,845
Oh, Jesus.

990
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,279
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- I'll go first.

991
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:10,978
All right. If this is the last thing you see,
that means I died.

992
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,577
- Hud, come on!
- Okay.

993
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,103
Look out! Oh, shit...

994
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,572
Okay.

995
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,270
- Okay. Okay.
- Shit.

996
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,240
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, God.

997
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,194
- Yes. Okay. You all right?
- Yeah.

998
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,358
We're almost there, come on.

999
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,269
Come on, Hud.

1000
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,031
Shit.

1001
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:12,373
Beth! Beth! Beth!

1002
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,856
- Can you get it?
- Do you need help?

1003
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,854
Do you need help? Or...

1004
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,132
Beth? Beth?

1005
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,734
Beth?

1006
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,341
Beth? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1007
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,883
- What?
- Shit.

1008
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:53,149
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Beth.

1009
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,557
- Beth.
- What?

1010
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,719
Beth!

1011
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,865
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1012
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,742
Can you hear me? Beth.

1013
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,493
Hey.

1014
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,068
- Are you really here?
- Yeah, I'm really here.

1015
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,959
Rob?

1016
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,866
You came back for me.

1017
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,038
Of course I came back for you.

1018
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:55,145
- I'm sorry it took me so long.
- No, it's okay.

1019
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,713
Okay, okay, okay. You're okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

1020
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,384
We'll get you out, all right?
Hud, put the camera down

1021
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,257
- and help me, okay?
- Okay, okay.

1022
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:08,755
- It'll be okay.
- Okay, here we go.

1023
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,231
- Lf we all just lift at the same time.
- Hold on, okay. We got you.

1024
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,063
- All right? We have to.
- Don't do that, Rob.

1025
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,796
- Please don't do that.
- It's gonna be over in a second.

1026
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:15,962
- All right?
- Okay. Ready, guys?

1027
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,266
- No, please. No.
- Slowly. It's okay.

1028
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,738
We're gonna do it real slow.

1029
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,502
- Easy, easy, just wait.
- No, don't.

1030
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,942
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1031
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:27,947
Oh, God.

1032
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:34,789
- Okay, now, sit down. Sit down.
- I know. I know. Here.

1033
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,826
I know. I know. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1034
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,225
- You're gonna be fine.
- No, no, no.

1035
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,822
I know, I know, I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

1036
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,701
What is that?

1037
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:51,803
- God.
- It's a terrible thing.

1038
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,671
- Okay. We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Okay. Let's go.

1039
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,107
- I got you.
- Oh, God.

1040
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,374
- Oh, God.
- All right. All right. Go, go, go.

1041
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,642
- Go.
- Okay. I got you.

1042
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,014
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

1043
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,349
Just hold on to me.
You're gonna be all right.

1044
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,090
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

1045
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,229
- Okay. Hang on to me.
- Oh, my God.

1046
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,732
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

1047
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:21,695
Okay.

1048
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,469
Oh, shit. Man, this is unbelievable.

1049
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,310
- Are you okay?
- Just don't look down, okay?

1050
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,574
- I can't help it.
- You're all right. You're all right.

1051
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:33,910
Oh, my God.

1052
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,014
Oh, God!

1053
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,549
- Okay, let's go.
- Keep moving, just go.

1054
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,750
Go, just go. Just go, go, go. Go.
Just get to the other side.

1055
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,885
Come on, just keep moving.

1056
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,198
Oh, my God.

1057
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:53,826
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

1058
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,427
- Oh, my God. Did you see that?
- Okay, come on.

1059
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,666
- Get inside.
- Okay. Come on, come on.

1060
01:02:58,774 --> 01:03:00,708
- Oh, God.
- Go! Go!

1061
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,247
Run! Run! Hurry!

1062
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:15,452
- Rob, come on!
- Oh, my God.

1063
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,337
Oh, my God.

1064
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,334
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1065
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,707
Something else also terrible.

1066
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:38,937
Rob, what time
do the choppers take off?

1067
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,879
- 0600.
- What time is that?

1068
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,543
- 6:00, Hud.
- Yeah, okay. I knew that.

1069
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:49,115
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

1070
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:26,962
Wait up!

1071
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,936
- Did we make it?
- We want to get out of here, come on.

1072
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:39,535
Let's go! Let's go!

1073
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:42,808
Keep your heads down.

1074
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,539
Come on! Come on!

1075
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,042
You guys are on the next chopper.

1076
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,948
- No!
- Clear this area. Clear this area.

1077
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,851
- No, no, wait. Wait.
- Lily!

1078
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,421
We'll be right behind you, okay?

1079
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:01,428
Wait for us. Wait for us.
We'll be right behind you.

1080
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,192
We're gonna be okay. All right?
We're gonna be all right, you hear me?

1081
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:20,276
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

1082
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,418
Stay low. Stay low.
Come on, come on, come on.

1083
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,227
Thank you.

1084
01:05:34,296 --> 01:05:37,925
- They're starting the bomb run.
- Get them out of here. Get going.

1085
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,135
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

1086
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:55,209
Oh, my God.
Are you guys seeing this right now?

1087
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:57,410
Are you seeing this right now?
Look, look, look.

1088
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,083
Are you seeing this shit right now?
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1089
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,764
Oh, God.
Those aren't gonna hit us, are they?

1090
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,663
Oh, my God. They hit it!
They just hit it right now!

1091
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:19,263
Look, you guys, they just hit it!
They hit it with... Oh, my God!

1092
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:22,872
- Yeah, they hit it, you guys! They hit it!
- Oh, he's going down.

1093
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,075
Target down. Target down.
Target down. He's down.

1094
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,979
I think they got him.

1095
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,552
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's the shit right there!

1096
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:34,487
That's what I'm talking about...
Oh, my God! Oh, no, no, no!

1097
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,818
Oh, my God. Oh my God.
God, please, God.

1098
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,989
Please, God. Please.
Please, God and Jesus.

1099
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,726
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

1100
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,359
I'm so sorry, God. Please, no.

1101
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,335
Help me, Rob!

1102
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,805
Rob. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1103
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:21,001
This is Hawkeye 6. Target still active.

1104
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:24,004
Initiating Hammer Down.
TO T, 15 minutes.

1105
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,308
Sirens will sound two minutes out.

1106
01:07:26,408 --> 01:07:29,206
If you can hear those sirens,
you're in the blasting zone.

1107
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,539
Come on. Come on. Hud.
Hud, are you okay?

1108
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:40,248
- Yeah, all right. I guess. I think so.
- I can't move my arm.

1109
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:42,654
- This is Duncan-Charlie, return to base.
- Help me, you got to help me.

1110
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,589
- God help us.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1111
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,320
Come on, help me.

1112
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,729
I know, I know. We're gonna
get you out of here. Come on.

1113
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,028
Hud, come over to the other side.

1114
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,898
You've got to pull him up.
Come on, come on.

1115
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,029
- Okay, okay.
- I don't think I can move.

1116
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:58,629
Yes, you can. Don't say that.

1117
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,003
Copy your last, we're on the move.

1118
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,770
- Here, take his hand. Take his hand.
- Good luck.

1119
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:04,471
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I got it.
Come on, come on.

1120
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,280
I got his legs, go!

1121
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:18,618
- My leg!
- I know. I know, I know. I know.

1122
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,059
It's okay, you're fine. You're good.
You're okay. You're okay.

1123
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,562
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding,
okay? Okay?

1124
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:23,996
I'm not okay.
I'm not gonna be able to walk.

1125
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:26,533
You are going to be able to walk.

1126
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,036
Don't do it.

1127
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:34,706
Okay. All right, listen,
we got to get out of here, okay?

1128
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:35,936
Well, which way do we go?

1129
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,172
We have to get away from here,
because I think it's gonna explode.

1130
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,113
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- All right? Come on. Let's go.

1131
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,685
Let's go this way. Come on.
Come on, you can walk. Okay.

1132
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,981
Come on. Hold on, wait a second.

1133
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:47,077
- Hud!
- Hud!

1134
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,249
What? Oh! Oh, no!

1135
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:54,351
- Hud! Hud!
- Hud, what are you doing?

1136
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:04,696
Hud!

1137
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,024
Hud!

1138
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,522
Hud!

1139
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:32,734
Hud!

1140
01:09:33,535 --> 01:09:36,026
Hud! Hud!

1141
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,032
Hud! Hud!

1142
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,705
Hud! Hud!

1143
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:43,936
Hud!

1144
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,950
He's gone.

1145
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:29,189
He's gone.

1146
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:32,424
- They're all gone.
- I know.

1147
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,969
We gotta go. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

1148
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,132
Where? There's nowhere to go to.

1149
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:48,471
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

1150
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,603
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

1151
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,410
Listen, we wait here,
they'll find us, all right?

1152
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,178
They're fighting him right now.
If we wait here, they'll find us.

1153
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,379
No, we can't stay.

1154
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,787
It's okay. It's okay.

1155
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:12,027
- I'm so scared.
- I know. I know. I know.

1156
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,023
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1157
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:46,898
It's 6:42 a.m. On Saturday, May 23.

1158
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:51,539
Approximately seven hours ago,
something attacked the city.

1159
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:53,973
I don't know what it is.

1160
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,301
If you found this tape... I mean,
if you're watching this right now,

1161
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,246
then you probably know more
about it than I do.

1162
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:06,149
Whatever it is,
it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

1163
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:09,315
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,
and Marlena Diamond,

1164
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,222
and many, many others.

1165
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:14,762
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

1166
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,195
The military has begun
bombing the creature

1167
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,358
and we're caught in the middle.

1168
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:22,359
Okay. Ready?

1169
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:28,374
It's okay.

1170
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,412
- Beth, look at me.
- I don't know what to say.

1171
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,006
Well, just tell them who you are.

1172
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:43,848
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre.
I don't know why this is happening.

1173
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,562
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

1174
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,028
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1175
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:06,512
Look at me, Beth.
Look at me. Look at me.

1176
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,947
- I love you.
- I love you.

1177
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,319
I know what I'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

1178
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,086
You are going to miss me
a little bit, right?

1179
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,627
Yeah, we'll see.

1180
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:22,528
Okay, yeah, all right.

1181
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,997
All right, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

1182
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,226
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

1183
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:27,461
Last thing to the camera.

1184
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,534
I had a good day.
