1
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,470
It's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,340
Beth's dad's place.

3
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,980
He's out of town.

4
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,990
And it's already a good day.

5
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,860
Beth.

6
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,600
- Rob, what are you doing? - nothing.

7
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,330
- well, then stop. - nothing.

8
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,370
- that's... - stop it.

9
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,830
She's shy.

10
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
I could just see this ending up on the internet.

11
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,870
Well, fine, cover up. see if I care.

12
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,000
- I'm interested in other things. - like what?

13
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,410
Like you.

14
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,290
- oh, man. - that was close.

15
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,780
Do it really... I'm scared of it.

16
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,860
- it's only 30 minutes out. - shut up. I've never been.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,620
You've never been to coney island?

18
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,220
Oh, how have you never been to coney island?

19
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,030
I don't know, I just... I've never been.

20
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, that's... it's so much fun. I'm taking you. we're going.

21
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,330
Oh, my god. you're so excited about this.

22
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,530
- yeah, I can't wait to... - give me this.

23
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,870
What are you doing? what?

24
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,700
Oh, all right. well, then from the neck up, okay?

25
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,370
That's the only way I consent to this.

26
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,970
Oh, please, Rob, nobody's paying for that online.

27
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,940
You've never been to twelve-chest-hairs. com, have you?

28
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,110
- okay. what else? - what else, what?

29
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,310
Other than cotton candy and tilt-a-whirls?

30
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,360
- what do you want to do today? - lf I answer that...

31
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,850
- all right, is this thing on? - look out!

32
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,980
Babe, it's not my camera.

33
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,720
I don't know if it's the on button or the zoom button.

34
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,460
All right. here, here, here. I think I got it. is this on?

35
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,160
Oh, perfect. and now we can have a nice record of you getting run over.

36
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,790
Is that funny?

37
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,500
What time is everybody starting to show up?

38
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,630
- it's getting late here. - a couple hours.

39
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,570
- that's why we have to hurry. - where are we going?

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,840
We're going... we're just going around the corner to the store!

41
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,140
I want you to go around with your brother's camera

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,110
And get testimonials from everyone.

43
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,550
Why? I mean, it's not like this is a wedding.

44
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,780
I know it's not a wedding. I said like a wedding.

45
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,590
I can't get this.

46
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,130
I don't get... I mean, I don't understand why I have to do it.

47
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,890
Cause, I mean, I don't... I don't even know how to work this...

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,120
- that's what I think is gonna happen. - no, I'm not!

49
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,530
- you totally are. you... - you have no clue!

50
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,660
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

51
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,100
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,830
Yeah. got you.

53
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,530
Good. now can you see me trying to carry these bags all by myself?

54
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,900
You're doing a great job.

55
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,340
Here, practice doing two things at once.

56
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,310
- that's good! that was good. - thank you.

57
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,440
I'm not lugging this thing around all night long

58
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,540
he is your brother.

59
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,710
This is important. stop freaking out.

60
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,810
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,610
- no, it isn't. - yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,920
Jason, I have been planning this for two weeks!

63
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,510
- all I want you to do is help me. - okay, babe, babe.

64
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,490
Okay. all right? I'll do it. it's fine.

65
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,190
I really pissed her off.

66
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,300
Babe, come on. I was just kidding! come on!

67
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,430
Hud? Hud, listen to me. I got a job for you.

68
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,130
I already have got a job.

69
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,370
- I'm doing the sign, so... - yeah, no. I see that

70
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,500
But this is more important than the sign. you know how, like, at weddings,

71
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,940
People give testimonials to the camera, right?

72
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,210
No.

73
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,380
All right. you're gonna take the camera and just, you know, go around the party

74
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,280
And film people wishing Rob good luck.

75
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,410
I don't know, man.

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,820
- that's a lot of responsibility. - this is important.

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,910
And then you have to do it the whole night...

78
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,020
And Marlena's gonna be here.

79
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,150
- she is? - oh, yeah. she is.

80
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,490
- so you're gonna take that. - oh, hold on.

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,860
- and you're gonna talk to her... - I didn't...

82
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,660
- for Rob. - I didn't say I would do it.

83
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,860
- just try it out. - all right, I'll do a few.

84
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,060
You can, just do mine...

85
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,300
- are you ready? - yeah, go.

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,770
All right.

87
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,070
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

88
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,300
Best of luck in japan. I love you so much,

89
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,640
And I'm proud of you.

90
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,310
- that's it. - that's it?

91
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,550
- yeah. easy enough. - yeah. it's actually kind of fun.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,980
- you enjoy it, Hud. - thanks, man.

93
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,150
Yeah, I'm doing...

94
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,690
Hey, what's up, man?

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,560
Hey, guys? hey.

96
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,590
- what do we say? - anything.

97
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,070
Bon voyage, Rob. or however you say that in japanese.

98
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,800
- Hud, what are you doing? - I'm documenting the night.

99
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,640
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

100
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,180
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it, so I've been doing it.

101
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,410
I've been doing it really well.

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,780
Well, are you gonna take it seriously, though?

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,250
Because it's really important.

104
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,620
No, of course. I've been taking it really, really seriously.

105
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,750
- very seriously. - you promise?

106
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah, you wanna do your testimonial now?

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,260
- okay. - yeah, do it right now.

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,350
Okay.

109
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,020
Okay, just open up to him, cause this is gonna be

110
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,930
- the last thing he sees you... - okay, Hud, I got it.

111
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,090
Robert hawkins,

112
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,400
I can't believe you're leaving me to look after your brother by myself.

113
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,460
Oh! easy, easy. I mean I'm obviously standing right here...

114
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,410
And I know we're not officially family, yet, but...

115
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,170
- not fair, 'cause I'm gonna... - dude.

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,440
- okay. - I'll cut him out later.

117
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,580
But I think of you as my brother, and I hope you think of me as a sister.

118
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,020
So, you better call us.

119
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,690
Now that you have this job, you can afford to call us, so...

120
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,690
- Hud? - yeah.

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,520
Yeah, sorry. no, you're good. you're good. you're good.

122
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,600
- that was good! - that's it?

123
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,690
I thought that was really, really good.

124
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,790
Yeah, but you weren't even paying attention for...

125
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,050
Okay. okay, you can do this.

126
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,250
Yeah. you got this, man. you got this.

127
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,990
- what's up, man? - hey, what's up, dude?

128
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,190
What's up?

129
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,130
Excuse me! hey, Marlena?

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,170
- hey, what's up? - hi. hi.

131
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,900
Hey, did you know that I'm going around

132
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,570
The party and I'm... do you know Rob's leaving?

133
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,970
- like it's his going-away party. - yeah. yeah.

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,340
Cool. hey, so we're taping, I think, people talking about him.

135
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,180
Oh, no, thank you. I barely even know Rob.

136
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,650
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily, so it's a little weird,

137
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,190
If I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

138
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,120
Okay, cool, except I'm supposed to get everybody.

139
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,130
So have you ever been to a wedding?

140
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,390
No, I get what you're doing. I just... I don't want to do it, but thank you.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,800
Okay, cool. we'll just do a short one real quick.

142
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,070
Okay.

143
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,880
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

144
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,710
I think we've met, like, probably three times before, total,

145
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,910
And every one of those times I was really drunk,

146
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,990
So I don't really even know what to say.

147
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,960
But you have a cool job! that's something!

148
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,290
- like you're president of something! - vice president!

149
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,830
Also really cool.

150
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,990
So good luck with that and we're gonna be here

151
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,430
Keeping new york really safe and fun for you when you come back.

152
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,400
- cool, that was a really good one. - yeah?

153
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,130
Yeah, we can do another one if you want.

154
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,970
Do you actually have, like a card or something?

155
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,240
Well, my agency... we're leaving. we're going on this stupid retreat

156
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,570
And they like all this video,

157
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,110
- like, bonding crap. - oh, yeah. I'm actually...

158
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,880
- I'm not a professional. - what?

159
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,540
- I'm not a professional. I'm Hud. - hug?

160
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,110
No, no, no, Hud. I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

161
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,520
- we met, like, several times before. - oh, yeah, yeah.

162
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,650
Yeah, you have the camera in front of your face,

163
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,490
- it's probably why I didn't... - okay, here. if I move it?

164
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,760
- oh, yeah. what's going on? totally. - yeah.

165
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,630
Yeah, cool. it's nice to see you again.

166
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,800
- really good to see you. really good. - so what have you been up to?

167
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,070
I actually... I'm gonna just go grab some food,

168
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,370
But good luck with the...

169
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,100
I could still do your agency's retreat if you wanted...

170
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,980
He's coming up the stairs right now. everybody get ready. get ready.

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,850
Can someone turn down the music, please?

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,190
Surprise! surprise!

173
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,490
No, no, no, no, no, no!

174
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,260
How did you guys plan all this?

175
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,800
Easy, you're naive. let's go.

176
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,430
- hey. how are you? - take this. take this.

177
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,660
- I'm sorry. yes. thank you. - what's up?

178
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,900
Oh, hey. yes. good.

179
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,310
- what's up, man? - speech!

180
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,440
- yeah, speech! speech! - speech! speech!

181
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,320
- oh, this is very surprising... - I hope so.

182
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,050
- obviously. - it's a surprise party.

183
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,380
Yeah.

184
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,580
But it's very sweet. so thank you. Lily?

185
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,790
It was everyone. it was everyone.

186
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,260
No, thank you, everyone. thank you. it's...

187
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Oh, it means a lot, so... that's it. that's all I got. I don't know.

188
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,070
- have a good time! - yeah, party!

189
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,330
Yeah!

190
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,840
- hey, man. were you surprised? - yo. I was, like, not even surprised.

191
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,740
No? can you describe your current emotions right now?

192
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,410
I don't know. I would say blase. like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.

193
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,950
- no, you're not. well, congrats. - no, man, that was awesome, dude.

194
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,490
What are you doing with the video camera by the way?

195
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,610
I'm documenting the night

196
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,210
So that you can take it to japan with you.

197
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,380
Oh, can I watch it every night when I get there.

198
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,460
Jason asked if i...

199
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,550
- yeah, you could. - oh, good.

200
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,460
All right, thank you. cool.

201
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,990
Hey, Hud, do you know if Beth's coming tonight?

202
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,560
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her. why wouldn't she be here?

203
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,350
So how are you gonna survive without Rob?

204
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,110
- he's like your main dude. - yeah, I know.

205
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,780
Hey, how am I gonna survive without you?

206
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,480
- I don't know. I'm like your main dude. - straight up.

207
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,120
- as I make my... I'm not here. - hi, Hud.

208
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,330
I'm just documenting. not here.

209
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,030
That was my biggest problem is that she picked him...

210
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,830
You know what. no, but when he said my fair lady...

211
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,840
- I love my fair lady. - I was like, "really?"

212
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,000
That was wonderful. but, I mean, it worked out, right?

213
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,510
Beth, hey! you made it.

214
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,240
It doesn't matter, dude, you're here. all is well.

215
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,410
Oh, no, it's good. it's good.

216
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,110
- enjoy it. have fun. - oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...

217
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
- who is that guy? - I don't know. he's random.

218
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,180
Here, I'm gonna go check it out. look out, documenting.

219
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,260
Oh, thanks.

220
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,520
- I missed your surprise. - oh, that's okay.

221
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,790
I'm sorry. no, we had cab problems. I'm really sorry.

222
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,460
- that's fine. - decorating's mine.

223
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,660
- no, that's fantastic. - Rob, this is travis.

224
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,900
- hi. - hi. oh, pleasure.

225
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,340
I've heard a lot about you.

226
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
- congratulations, by the way. - thank you.

227
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,510
- vice president. that's fantastic. - I love your dress.

228
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,940
- thank you. I love yours. - yeah, thank you.

229
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,670
That's really amazing.

230
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,910
- should we... - yeah, there's a buffet.

231
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,950
Hey, I'm documenting the night. I'm Hud.

232
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,280
- okay. - so, there's tons of sake.

233
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,150
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

234
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,550
- enjoy, everybody. - it's good to meet you.

235
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,560
- have a good one, yeah. - thanks for coming.

236
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,090
- I think he just said I was cute. - are they dating?

237
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,290
Yeah.

238
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,180
- hey, is everything cool, man? - yeah, everything's cool.

239
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,550
Okay, because... I don't know, because you been over here kind of...

240
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,710
Is that my camera?

241
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,260
I don't know. your brother gave it to me.

242
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,590
Did you switch the tape? because I had a tape in there.

243
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,720
I don't know. was...

244
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,430
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like, any kind of tea-cuppy thing...

245
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,560
Tape was in here when I got it. why?

246
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,170
- Rob, why? - no, it doesn't matter.

247
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,210
It doesn't... it's stupid.

248
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,600
Okay, are you sure you're cool? because you're really weirding me out.

249
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,840
Like, we haven't been hanging out or anything.

250
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,110
- here. here, man. come on. - all right, cool. that's more like it.

251
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,710
Excuse me. sorry. excuse me.

252
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,990
- what's wrong with you? - hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

253
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,520
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob. do you want to say something?

254
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,790
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob. do you want to say something?

255
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,760
Oh, Hud, I don't know. it's not a really good time right now.

256
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,960
Come on, he's leaving.

257
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,360
- I mean, can we... - I know.

258
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,760
You're not gonna be able to talk to him for a while.

259
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,230
Isn't there something you wanna say?

260
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,910
You know what? travis, can you get me a drink?

261
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,870
- oh, yeah. yeah. yeah, of course. - is that... okay.

262
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,470
Cool, thanks.

263
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,840
Okay, let's... right here? I don't...

264
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,470
- no, we can do it in the kitchen. - okay, perfect.

265
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,680
Okay.

266
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,780
Okay.

267
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,250
Rob,

268
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,050
I didn't want to do this on camera.

269
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,600
But, I just... I just want you to know how happy I am for you,

270
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,400
Because I know how hard you've worked for this job

271
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,170
And I know how much it means to you and...

272
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,670
And I'm really gonna miss you.

273
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,980
Hey. can I talk to you for a second?

274
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,150
Jason? there's something totally weird going on with Rob and Beth.

275
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,350
- what are you talking about? - I'm serious. they're right outside.

276
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,160
- Hud! not now. - okay. I'll check it out.

277
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,930
You never even called me, Rob!

278
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,520
You go and bring some guy to my party?

279
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,870
Hold on! you haven't talked to me in weeks!

280
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,670
- Hud, man! come on! - sorry!

281
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,140
- what? what? - I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

282
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,080
- but I'm documenting! - not this.

283
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,880
Lily, do you know what they were fighting about?

284
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,810
Lily, if you know, you have to tell me. Lily.

285
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,010
I'm not telling you.

286
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,710
I really should know, as the guy documenting this.

287
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,810
She was the one who brought me back inside.

288
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,980
- okay, fine. we'll go find out. - I'm positive. I promise.

289
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,960
- we'll ask her. we'll go find out. - she's in the kitchen.

290
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,960
- what? - lil!

291
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,360
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

292
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,520
- no. - you do, don't you?

293
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,600
- what? no. - Hud, you're a genius.

294
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,930
- you're dodging the question right now. - there is nothing to tell you.

295
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,020
- nothing. - liar.

296
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,800
Lily, if you know something, you have to tell us.

297
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,890
- no. - look at me.

298
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,100
- Lily. - I know you. babe.

299
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,470
Okay, fine, but not on camera. I'm not telling you on camera.

300
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,840
Okay, that's not a problem. all right, no problem.

301
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,440
Why would we say anything?

302
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,040
- we won't say anything. - Rob and Beth slept together.

303
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,810
- are you serious? - it happened a few weeks ago.

304
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,390
Beth made me promise not to say anything.

305
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,480
Are you kidding me, Lily?

306
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,210
Rob and Beth sleep together, you're not gonna tell me?

307
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,590
- why wouldn't you tell me? - why wouldn't I tell you?

308
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,720
Okay, you guys, don't ask me where I heard this.

309
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,490
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

310
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,400
- I knew it. - are you kidding me?

311
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,490
No, I'm not kidding. this is extremely serious.

312
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,220
Hey, Marlena.

313
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,700
- it's me, Hud, from before. - hi. right.

314
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,400
Did you know that Rob and Beth had sex?

315
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,070
- no. - yeah, isn't that crazy?

316
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,230
- they've been friends forever. - crazy.

317
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,400
I mean, Rob's been in love with her since college.

318
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,970
Well, maybe it was like a going-away present, you know?

319
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,980
Yeah. wait, were we supposed to get presents?

320
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,780
- they did. they had sexual intercourse. - what?

321
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,980
- Lily told me. - no way.

322
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,150
- no, you are so... - no, I promise.

323
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,250
Why do you make up stuff like that?

324
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,690
- no, I do not. I have a nice car. - you make shit up.

325
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,660
I didn't say what kind...

326
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,920
Hey.

327
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,170
- good luck in japan, Rob. - good luck tonight, travis.

328
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,250
Hey, dude. dude, dude, dude. are you all right, man?

329
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,110
- hey. come on. - this is not the time, Hud.

330
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,440
- what is it, man? - let him go.

331
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,350
- we should talk to him. - we're not talking to him.

332
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,650
I could talk to him now.

333
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:10,830

felixfight lethe volcanojbe

335
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,380
Dude, you already talked to the whole party!

336
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,820
...have to do something. - no. everyone needs to just calm down

337
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,020
- and give him space. - he's just gonna stay

338
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,820
- iocked in his room all night? - Lily, look at you.

339
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,620
- it's fine, trust me. - it is not fine.

340
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,320
- it is fine. - you are his brother.

341
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,760
You are his best friend. go and make him happy.

342
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,430
So, how do you wanna do this? do you wanna do most of the talking,

343
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,970
Or do you want me to do most of the talking?

344
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,010
- you're not doing any talking. - okay, cool.

345
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,170
We got to talk.

346
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,260
You don't know what you're talking about,

347
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,540
- okay, well, then tell me.

348
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,870
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

349
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,210
Yeah, well, Beth told lori that after you guys got together,

350
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,720
- you totally blew her off. - I didn't blow her off!

351
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,810
She said you never called her.

352
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,410
Look, I'm leaving, all right? so what am I supposed to do?

353
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,080
I don't know, man. she was heartbroken.

354
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,590
Look, there's no "together." it's just her and me, two separate things.

355
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,790
It's better if we just stay friends.

356
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,560
...not that I feel like I'm not good enough for her!

357
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,600
No, stop, stop! I didn't say "feel," Rob.

358
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,290
You're not good enough for her.

359
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,230
That's it. that's fact. that's science.

360
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,970
Beth Mclntyre is, like, from a whole 'nother planet, man.

361
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,070
She's beautiful. she's charming. and you... I love you,

362
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,410
But let's face it, you're kind of a douchebag.

363
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,180
And going to japan is not gonna fix that. she's crazy about you, bro.

364
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,480
- like, right now, as you are. - and you're in love with her.

365
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,250
- but you got to go after her. - it's not that simple.

366
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,590
- no, it is that simple, Rob. - come on, man. don't be scared.

367
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,850
It's about moments, man. that's all that...

368
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,220
You got to learn to say, "forget the world,"

369
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,850
And hang on to the people that you care about the most.

370
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,900
Oh, god. oh, god. oh, my god. what the hell was that?

371
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,700
That scared the shit out of me.

372
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,370
Lil! lil!

373
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,240
Did you feel that? it was like an earthquake.

374
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,410
- you guys... - lil, where are you?

375
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,240
- what was that? - what was that?

376
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,840
- hey. are you all right? - oh, my god.

377
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,280
- yeah, that was really scary. - did you see anything?

378
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,050
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

379
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,280
Guys, look out!

380
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,450
- okay. - it was like a bomb.

381
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,590
All right, here we go. here we go. here we go. here we go.

382
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,750
Wait. everyone quiet down. all right?

383
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,020
- but now, just approximately... - shut up, shut up.

384
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,600
...15 minutes after word... - guys! come on.

385
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,140
...of a possible earthquake in lower manhattan.

386
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,470
Nearby, in new york harbor, we're getting word of an oil tanker capsizing

387
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,030
In the middle of the harbor near the statue of liberty.

388
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,580
- once again... - dude, that's really close.

389
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,840
...there's no way to know if any... - that's really, really close.

390
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,850
That's true. do you think we could see something from the roof?

391
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,420
- I don't know. maybe. - j, wanna go to the roof?

392
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,650
Let's go see if we can see something on the roof.

393
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,950
Come on, Jason. we're not going up to the roof.

394
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,150
- yeah, let's go up there. - I don't think we should.

395
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,630
- no! - that was really...

396
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,300
What do you think? think it's another terrorist attack?

397
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,300
- it's insane, man. - watch your step.

398
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,310
It was shaking everywhere, man. just like tremors.

399
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,040
- yeah, it's on the news downstairs. - is this the only lights that went out?

400
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,710
- I think they blew up the trains. - no, a couple did.

401
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,120
- some stayed on. - oh, man. what is going on?

402
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,280
Maybe you should've left town a little bit earlier, right?

403
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,650
Shut up.

404
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,530
Oh, my god!

405
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,860
No, no, no.

406
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,860
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

407
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,460
Hud. move. Hud!

408
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,820
Oh, god.

409
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,250
- Rob, you got a set of keys? - get out of here!

410
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,920
Right, did you look back? did anybody get hurt?

411
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,730
- did anybody see Jason or not? - I don't know.

412
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,830
Did anybody see Jason? has anybody seen Jason?

413
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,740
- did anybody see Jason? - is he inside?

414
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,170
Oh, my god! oh! oh, shit!

415
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,220
Oh, jesus christ!

416
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,580
- oh, god! oh, god! - oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god!

417
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,360
Oh, my god!

418
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,730
You gotta take your stuff and we gotta get out of here, man!

419
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,030
I'm telling you!

420
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,940
- I'm so sorry. - where were you?

421
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,480
Hey, did you guys see that? did you guys just see that?

422
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,590
Go! let's go!

423
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,500
- hey, get down! get down! - you all right? you all right?

424
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,080
Yeah, did you guys see that?

425
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,540
- did you guys see that? - you all right?

426
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,410
There are people still out there.

427
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,370
Rob! Rob! hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

428
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,130
- Rob. - what?

429
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,200
- Rob, I saw it! - what?

430
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,360
- what's he saying? - it's alive.

431
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,580
Stay down, Lily! get back!

432
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,550
He's going away now.

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,020
- Jason, what are you doing? - Jason, where are you going?

434
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,760
Lily, just wait.

435
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,130
- Jason, don't go out... - Jason, don't!

436
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,570
Lily, just wait here!

437
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,700
Hey, Rob! Rob! where's he going, dude?

438
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,710
- Jason! - Rob. Rob!

439
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,530
- oh, my god. Marlena? - oh, god.

440
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,030
Are you okay? wait, come here. come here. sit down.

441
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,290
It walked right through that street over there.

442
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,880
That's what I'm trying to tell you. it walked right over my head.

443
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,060
- what? - that's the sound it's making.

444
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,360
You said you saw something, right? so what did you see?

445
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,730
- you said it was alive? what was it? - who cares what it...

446
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,530
I don't know, man. I don't know. I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

447
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,670
Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!

448
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,900
- well, then rewind it. rewind it. - yeah. here, here. let me rewind it...

449
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,340
It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

450
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,940
Yeah, but I don't even speak the language.

451
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,480
Oh, come on. how hard could it be?

452
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,420
It's japanese. it's japanese-hard.

453
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,350
- it'll be fine. - do you really think I should go?

454
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,360
- oh, my god. - that makes no sense.

455
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,120
- that makes no sense. - did you see it?

456
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,360
I don't know what it was, of course! it was giant.

457
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,870
It was like... did you see that thing?

458
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,960
- I'm not yelling at you, all right? - yes, you are!

459
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,970
Hey, guys, guys, come on! everybody just calm down!

460
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,510
- quiet, guys. - all right. come on, just shut up!

461
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,300
All right? we don't know what we saw! the point is it's still here!

462
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,710
All right? so we need to get the hell out of manhattan!

463
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,440
- now. - yeah, yeah.

464
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,240
And out to the brooklyn bridge. I think it's the best plan.

465
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,280
- it's a straight shot to delancey. - just take the williamsburg.

466
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,350
No. do you know how far that is? brooklyn is right there.

467
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,950
No, no, no, dude. it's so much closer. it's right here.

468
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,020
- center street's like a block away. - what's going on?

469
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,720
I think we're gonna get out of here. is she okay to...

470
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,490
Okay, yeah. yeah, okay. Marlena, we're gonna get out of here, okay?

471
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,500
It was eating people. it was eating everyone.

472
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,330
We gotta go! go! let's go!

473
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,760
Okay, come here.

474
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,530
- go, go, go, go, go. - I don't think... don't even look.

475
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,400
- is anyone's phone working? - what?

476
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,950
- Hud, is your phone working? - what?

477
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,610
- no... - shit! I left it in the apartment.

478
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,210
- there's no signal. - you're not getting a signal either?

479
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,650
No, no, come on.

480
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,480
- Hud, come on! - what? okay.

481
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,260
It's all right.

482
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,430
Let's go.

483
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,800
We need an iv.

484
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,030
- calm down, please. - let's go, people.

485
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,440
- let's go. let's go. - excuse me, officer.

486
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,100
Do you know... what was that thing? what was it?

487
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,770
Look, if you're not injured, you got to keep moving, man.

488
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,710
Let's go! let's go, people! let's go!

489
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,180
Yeah, once we get to the bridge, we'll be safe.

490
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,180
Hey, how are you? is she doing better?

491
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,020
She's okay. she's gonna be fine.

492
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,350
- Marlena, you saw it. what was that? - not now, Hud.

493
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,590
Sorry.

494
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,290
Please go in an orderly manner.

495
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,170
Continue moving south towards brooklyn.

496
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,900
- just keep going. - yeah, I don't know. it got hit.

497
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,040
Once we get over there, I'll go to my cousin's house.

498
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,770
She has a condo. she's out of town.

499
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,150
I repeat, do not stop. keep moving.

500
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,490
There will be instructions on the brooklyn side...

501
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,660
Get across the bridge. move in a quick and orderly fashion.

502
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,430
- you still filming? - yeah.

503
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,710
People are gonna wanna know how it all went down.

504
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,450
Well, you can just tell them how it all went down, Hud.

505
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,070
No, that wouldn't work.

506
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,680
People need to see this, you know? this is gonna be important.

507
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,350
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

508
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,420
- Beth? Beth? - Rob!

509
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,350
Beth, I've been trying to reach you. are you okay? hello?

510
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,500
Wait a second, you guys! look, hey! Lily, stop!

511
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,770
I'm sorry. it's really loud here. can you speak up?

512
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,030
Lily!

513
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,570
- what? - Rob got a hold of Beth.

514
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,540
Wait! Jason, wait!

515
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,730
- Rob's got Beth on the phone! - what'd you say?

516
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,900
- what? - hey, y'all, come on.

517
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,610
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

518
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,550
Okay, Beth, you're gonna have to calm down, okay?

519
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,850
Where are you? what do you mean, you can't move?

520
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,790
- what? - I repeat, no panicking.

521
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,230
Did you see it?

522
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,110
- Jason! - can you see anything?

523
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,650
No, I can't get over there!

524
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,950
I can't... I can't see anything! can you see it?

525
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,720
Jason!

526
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,880
- why did you stop? - Jason!

527
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,980
- what? - Jason, watch out!

528
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,930
Jason! no, Jason! no!

529
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,370
Jason!

530
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,340
- no, no! god! no, Jason! Jason! - Lily, come on!

531
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,970
Jason! no!

532
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,140
Go, go, go, go!

533
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,690
Go, go, go, go!

534
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,360
Lily. Lily, wait. stop! turn around and listen to me right now.

535
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,460
Would somebody please, please tell me what just happened?

536
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,370
- I don't know. - I mean, it came out of nowhere!

537
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,060
And he was there and then he was gone!

538
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,140
- my god! Jason! Jason! - Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

539
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,770
- my god! Jason! Jason! - Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

540
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,210
Rob. you got to listen to me, man. I am so sorry about your brother.

541
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,750
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry. are you okay? Rob?

542
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,250
Oh, shit. oh, shit!

543
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,490
- Rob. Rob, dude. - we can't stay here.

544
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,930
- we can't. - Rob. we got to get out of here, man.

545
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,230
Listen to me. we got... we got to get moving, man.

546
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,860
We go to the manhattan bridge, you know?

547
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,630
We got to get out of here. it's not safe here.

548
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,170
Okay, we can go to the other side. we can try and get

549
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,400
To the lincoln tunnel. I don't know, man. I don't know, but...

550
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,970
Dude, we got to get out of here. it's not safe here.

551
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,210
What are we gonna do, rob? what are we gonna do?

552
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,810
Do you know? hey!

553
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,080
Look... hey, jesus. Rob. hey, Rob?

554
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,090
- no. - Rob!

555
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,170
- my battery's dead. - yeah, dude, i...

556
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,060
Well, listen, we got to get out of here, man. you know?

557
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,330
- Rob! Rob! - well, where's he going?

558
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,930
Where are you going?

559
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,670
Oh, god. I'll go get him. hey, Rob!

560
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,870
Rob! dude! I can't take all this running, man!

561
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,880
Hey, Rob.

562
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,380
Excuse me. hey, Rob! the store's closed, man!

563
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,720
- Rob, Rob! ...burning right now.

564
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,790
The bridge was filled with pedestrians traveling across.

565
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,120
- it has collapsed. - holy shit.

566
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,250
No word on injuries yet, but...

567
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,570
Oh, god.

568
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,600
We continue now with our breaking news story in lower manhattan.

569
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,510
We are getting some truly extraordinary live images here in the studio.

570
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,800
For those of you just joining us,

571
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,510
Lower manhattan is in an absolute state of siege

572
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,210
In what has been...

573
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,750
This is a mandatory evacuation.

574
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,260
Proceed south immediately.

575
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,630
Get out of the city in an orderly fashion.

576
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,570
This is a mandatory evacuation! we need everyone out of this area now!

577
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,000
Rob? Rob! hey, dude!

578
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,200
Actually, I think we need to get out of here, like, right now!

579
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,470
Do you know what I'm saying? because there's some

580
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,970
Serious shit going on outside! Rob? no, like, you know what I mean?

581
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,010
Rob, like, there's some strange shit going on! Rob?

582
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,540
Donna martel is near the scene at city hall.

583
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,840
What's going on?

584
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,880
Can you tell us what it looks like on the ground there?

585
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,220
Well, bob, the military will not let us get too close,

586
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,760
But from what we can see, there's clearly a sizable mobilization

587
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,120
Of troops and equipment,

588
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,090
And they're trying to get everyone to leave the area...

589
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,290
To be honest, tom, your guess is as good as mine at this point.

590
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,660
There appears to be something coming off of it.

591
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,930
And the ground seems to be covered in debris...

592
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,660
It looks like there's something falling of it, doesn't it?

593
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,500
Yes. yes. yes, it does.

594
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,870
There are pieces falling all over the street.

595
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,740
- oh, my god. - whatever they are, they are moving.

596
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,830
- oh, my god! they're... - donna!

597
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,000
- they're right there! - oh, shit.

598
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,080
- donna, can you hear us? - hey!

599
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,240
What are you doing? we got to get out of here! where is he?

600
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,340
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

601
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,650
- Rob! Rob! - I've been trying to do that!

602
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,520
Rob. Rob. we gotta go right now, okay?

603
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,350
- the military's evacuating everyone. - hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

604
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,550
We gotta get out of here.

605
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,060
- it's time to leave the electronics store. - Rob, come on. we got to go.

606
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,420
- just come on. let's go... - just stop it!

607
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,050
Okay? stop, wait!

608
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,200
To listen to your messages...

609
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,300
Rob! Rob! I can't... oh, god! I can't move.

610
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,640
It fell. my apartment... the whole wall fell on me!

611
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,020
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding. I can't move.

612
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,110
Oh, my god.

613
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,620
Help me, Rob.

614
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,090
To delete this message...

615
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,280
Rob, wait up! Rob!

616
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,810
I got your message, and I'm on my way there, okay?

617
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,380
Hey, Rob, listen. you got to think this through, man.

618
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,850
Okay? Beth lives in midtown. midtown is that way.

619
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,180
- guess what else is that way? - will you wait up?

620
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,650
- some horrific shit is in midtown! - this is insane, okay?

621
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,620
We're not gonna go near that thing, okay?

622
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,490
We're not gonna go to the middle of the city!

623
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,220
No, we're not. you're not coming with me.

624
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,130
Look. fall in with the military. fall in with the crowd.

625
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,560
Let them escort you out of here.

626
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,760
Okay?

627
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,100
- Rob! - I'm sorry. I got to go.

628
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,690
Rob!

629
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,930
- Rob! listen! - Rob, wait a minute!

630
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,630
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

631
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,270
And that's gonna be very uncomfortable for everybody involved!

632
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,710
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

633
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,340
Look at me. this is not me crazy. all right? I know what I'm doing.

634
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,470
And you can't talk me out of it.

635
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,080
- so turn around, go... - I'm coming.

636
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,090
I'm coming with you.

637
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,610
I'm coming with you.

638
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,720
Lily, you don't have to do that.

639
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,920
- no, I want to. I'm coming. - guys, did you not hear her message?

640
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,790
I mean, even if we get to Beth's, there's a chance

641
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,730
- that she's already... - shut up.

642
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,930
Guys, this is insane.

643
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,600
- Rob! - you know what I'm talking about, right?

644
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,970
You can't possibly think that this is a good idea.

645
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,170
Rob! Rob!

646
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,240
- Rob! - hey... hold...

647
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,870
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

648
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,850
Yeah, but I don't understand you. Rob, hold up!

649
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,980
Look, I'm sorry. hey, listen to me. man.

650
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,580
- Hud! - I'm so sorry.

651
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,210
Hey, Rob! wait up, please!

652
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,290
Rob! have you tried maybe calling 911,

653
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,120
- see if somebody else can get there? - yeah, I tried!

654
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,560
Okay, well. I mean, what about police? fire department?

655
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,760
- I couldn't get through! I tried, i... - okay, it just seems a little...

656
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,190
- oh, shit. - oh, my god!

657
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,630
Oh! oh, my god.

658
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,440
Oh, my god! oh, my god!

659
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,140
Rob! Rob! hey, Rob!

660
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,980
- Hud! we're gonna go this way! - I can't hear you!

661
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,860
- subway! - what? what?

662
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,790
- oh, shit! oh, shit! - come on! come on!

663
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,160
This shit is crazy, dude!

664
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,600
Oh, rob, dude. there's like...

665
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,450
Hud! Hud!

666
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,490
Are you okay, man? you all right?

667
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,950
- yeah. yeah, I'm all right. - come on.

668
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,510
- okay. okay. oh, god damn. - oh, shit.

669
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,400
What the hell was that?

670
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:52,130
- oh, shit. oh, shit. - did you see that?

671
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,970
- oh, my god. oh, god. - did you see that?

672
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,690
Okay.

673
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,730
Hey, look. we can just cross... we can just cross to the other platform,

674
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,830
Then go up the stairs and see if the other side of the street...

675
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,100
Rob, the other side of the street looks the same as this side!

676
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,140
We can wait for there to be a lull, and then make a break for it!

677
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,180
Rob, the air caught on fire! okay? there's not gonna be a lull!

678
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,540
But if we wait on the other...

679
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,380
Listen to me, man, I am with you, okay? I really, really am.

680
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,940
I'm just saying, you gotta listen to what's going on up there.

681
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,980
- we can't... - Rob, he's right, okay?

682
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,490
We have to wait. we have to wait.

683
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,950
This is insane.

684
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,130
Shit!

685
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,080
- oh, god. - what? Rob, what?

686
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,720
Hey, mom.

687
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,900
Yeah, no. I'm okay. okay, yeah, we are.

688
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,730
We're being evacuated right now. the army's here.

689
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,930
We're being evacuated, so don't worry. okay, but mom... mom, listen.

690
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:38,970
We tried to get out of the city, and we took the brooklyn bridge,

691
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,280
And we were right there when it hit.

692
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,010
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, mom.

693
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,550
I don't know what to say to him.

694
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,350
You know?

695
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,380
Like, I feel like I should say something,

696
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,720
But I don't know what to say.

697
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,450
I'm not even supposed to be here.

698
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,680
You didn't have to be. I mean,

699
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,750
You had your chance in the alley.

700
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,120
You could've left us.

701
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,330
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up with some friends or something, right?

702
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,760
Yeah.

703
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,070
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,100
- this isn't a bad idea. - just walk.

705
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,480
- wait, so then... - what's going on?

706
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,050
I don't know.

707
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,520
...just go across here. - that's good.

708
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,530
Yeah. this is the six.

709
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,290
Rob, I don't think the trains are running right now, man.

710
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,450
- no, we can just walk the track, see? - yeah.

711
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,030
Look. Beth lives here, columbus circle.

712
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,790
We can just walk down the six to lexington and then walk down

713
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,900
- central park south. - you want us to walk in the tunnels?

714
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,200
It's either that or stay here.

715
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,140
I'll walk the tunnels.

716
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,510
I can't see.

717
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,920
- it's kind of freaking me out, you know? - I think there's a light on the camera.

718
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,520
- let me see. - there is?

719
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,990
Yeah, right here. see?

720
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,430
Okay.

721
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,080
Ocean is big, dude.

722
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,980
All I'm saying is a couple of years ago,

723
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,080
They found a fish in madagascar that they thought

724
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,180
- had been extinct for centuries. - so what?

725
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,190
It's been down there this whole time, and nobody noticed?

726
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,350
Sure. maybe it erupted from an ocean trench, you know?

727
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,900
Or a crevasse. crevice. it's just a theory.

728
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,990
I mean, for all we know, it's from another planet and it flew here.

729
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,700
- like superman? - yeah, exactly like...

730
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,930
Wait. you know who superman is?

731
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,670
Oh, my god. you know who superman is?

732
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,370
- okay, I'm not... - I'm, like, feeling something.

733
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,450
- are you aware of garfield? - a lot of people think

734
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,140
He's from a planet that he's not actually from.

735
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,580
I just can't stop thinking about how the last thing I said to her was,

736
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,780
"good luck tonight, travis."

737
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,650
She knows you didn't mean that.

738
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,600
When I think of some of the things I said to Jason...

739
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,860
- no, that's different. - why?

740
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,960
Jason knew you loved him.

741
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,920
Hey, do you guys remember a couple of years ago, when that guy

742
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,110
Was lighting homeless people on fire in the subways?

743
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,710
- jesus, Hud. - what?

744
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,590
It's maybe not the best topic for conversation down here.

745
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,850
Right.

746
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,660
I just can't stop thinking how scary it would be if a flaming homeless guy

747
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,960
- came out of the dark right now. - Hud, seriously.

748
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,130
- seriously. - I'm just saying. sorry.

749
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,810
- what was that? - let's just keep moving.

750
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,170
- what was that? - let's just keep moving.

751
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,150
Holy shit! oh, god, this is nasty.

752
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,440
Holy shit! oh, god, this is nasty.

753
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,510
This is disgusting.

754
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,450
They're all running in the same direction.

755
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,390
- yeah, like they're running away. - from what?

756
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,000
Hey, how much farther?

757
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,930
I don't know. let's get out at the next station.

758
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,400
- okay? - yeah.

759
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,540
Did you guys hear that?

760
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,540
- what is that? - just listen.

761
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,280
I don't see anything. do you guys?

762
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,410
- oh, man, this is the worst. - will you be quiet for five seconds?

763
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,890
- oh, turn on the night vision. - what?

764
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,290
- what do you mean? - it's right here.

765
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,020
I got it. it's right here. there.

766
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,460
Is it on?

767
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,930
- oh, shit. - what? what?

768
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,130
- run. okay, run. okay, run. - what?

769
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,760
Hey, let's start running! just run! just run! just start running right now!

770
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,370
Start running now! run, run, run! run! just run!

771
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,310
- Lily! - you guys!

772
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,280
Wait.

773
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,410
Oh, god! help! please help! you guys, help!

774
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,600
Marlena! here!

775
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,610
Come on. let's go! let's go! let's go! let's go!

776
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,370
Hud!

777
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,090
...there you go. - totally not what I was thinking...

778
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:31,720
...there you go. - totally not what I was thinking...

779
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,670
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

780
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,270
You okay?

781
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,350
You tell me.

782
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,840
How does it look?

783
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,620
Looks like it hurts.

784
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,060
What do you mean? you're saying this isn't attractive, like, at all?

785
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,130
A little bit.

786
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,130
- here. here, here. you can wash it off. - thanks.

787
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,370
Here. did it get you, Hud? did it bite you, man?

788
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,170
No, it didn't get me.

789
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,580
Okay. okay.

790
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,410
Hey. hey.

791
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,080
So those things came out of nowhere, right?

792
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,120
- yeah. - oh, man.

793
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,650
That one that grabbed me, it was trying to drag me away.

794
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,230
What's up with that?

795
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,530
- maybe it liked you, Hud. - yeah.

796
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,800
Maybe it was trying to make me its queen.

797
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,780
Hey, thanks for coming back and helping me out, you know?

798
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,720
What? you think that I'm the kind of person that wouldn't do that?

799
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,350
No. no. I know you aren't.

800
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:12,650
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.

801
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,800
Otherwise, I would have been totally dead.

802
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,930
Right?

803
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,670
It's okay. you just got bit.

804
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,000
Hey.

805
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,470
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

806
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,920
Well, we could wait here for a little bit, I guess,

807
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,080
And just hope those things don't make it through the door.

808
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,090
- yeah, okay. what's the next option? - well.

809
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,920
Okay, we could see what's out through this way.

810
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,050
- maybe find another tunnel. - no, no more tunnels.

811
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,120
Then, I don't know. we try our luck up top.

812
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,790
Okay, just to be clear, so our options are

813
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,460
Die here, die in the tunnels, or die in the streets. is that...

814
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,770
- yeah, pretty much. ...pretty much the summing up of it?

815
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,310
But wait, we don't even know where we are, right?

816
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,610
So, let's just go up and look around. see if we recognize anything.

817
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,110
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

818
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,650
- no, I'm fine. I'm fine. - here, I'll help you.

819
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,670
- we're at 59th. - we're at 59th.

820
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,510
- yeah. - we're at 59th.

821
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,990
That's weird.

822
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,050
What?

823
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,260
Yeah.

824
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,720
Hello!

825
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,570
Marlena?

826
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,030
- what's wrong? - are you okay?

827
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,240
I'm really... I'm dizzy.

828
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,070
Yeah. do you wanna sit down for a second?

829
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,280
- no, I'm fine. - she needs a doctor.

830
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,480
- you sure? - I'm totally fine.

831
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,980
You know, 'cause we could sit down if you want to.

832
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,050
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

833
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,680
We've got civilians! are there any more of you?

834
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,090
- no, just us four. - it's just us.

835
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,680
We got four civilians here.

836
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,160
- okay, bring them in. - roger.

837
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,460
- let's go, move. move it. - okay, okay.

838
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,800
- let's go! - okay, okay.

839
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,600
Excuse me, sir? sir? excuse me.

840
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,230
Listen, we need your help. our friend, she's hurt. she's trapped

841
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,870
In her building right by here, at columbus circle.

842
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,340
That is not where you wanna be right now.

843
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,050
Do you guys know what it is? out there? do you know what that thing is?

844
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:20,840
Do you guys know what it is? out there? do you know what that thing is?

845
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,320
If they know, they ain't telling me. whatever it is, it's winning.

846
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,250
- what's up? - we got another bite here.

847
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,130
Don't look at that. gross.

848
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,900
- please, we can't stay here. we have... - hey, not now.

849
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,440
- copy that. - sir, we have two f-18s

850
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,130
On route from selfridge. four more are arming up,

851
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,730
- maybe 30 minutes out. - roger that.

852
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,780
Listen up, people. rack them and pack them.

853
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,040
- we're phantoms in 15. - sir.

854
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,010
- where the hell did you find them? - they were in the tunnels.

855
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,140
Yeah, we had to walk all the way from spring street.

856
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,590
Get them ready for transport,put them on the evac chopper.

857
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,680
- yes, sir. let's move. move, move. - no, wait. wait.

858
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,050
- listen, our friend is very badly hurt. - move it.

859
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,150
- move. move. - we have to get to her.

860
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,560
Sorry, son, can't help you. get them on the chopper.

861
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,130
No, but, please, listen to me. let go! just listen for a second, please!

862
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,860
Turn that goddamned camera...

863
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,300
- we've been trying to get to her all... - make our own way.

864
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,960
- no, do you have a... - I am not jeopardizing this operation,

865
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,400
- or my men. - I don't want your help.

866
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,940
You are getting on that chopper now.

867
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,370
I just need you to listen to me for one second, sir.

868
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,600
- you have no idea what's out there. - I don't care what's out there.

869
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,680
Listen to me. she's dying.

870
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,940
There is nothing I can do about that now.

871
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,450
The girl that I love more than anything is dying and it's my fault.

872
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,210
She should have been with me tonight, and I let her go and...

873
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,290
And I get it, okay? you have your hands full. I get that.

874
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,260
I get that, but we're gonna go after her, and if you wanna stop me,

875
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,690
- then you're gonna have to shoot me. - Hud.

876
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,290
- I don't feel so good. - oh, shit.

877
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,330
- bite! we've got a bite! - Marlena.

878
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,600
- hold on a second. - get her moving.

879
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,760
Keep moving!

880
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,960
Hey, Marlena, are you okay? hey, what are you guys doing?

881
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,970
Hold on a second. where are you taking her?

882
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,800
Hold on a second. wait! oh my god, wait!

883
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,940
- Marlena, stop! just wait a second! - let me go.

884
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,310
- just wait a second. please. - let me go.

885
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,900
- wait! Marlena! - get out of the way.

886
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,740
Marlena! hold on a second!

887
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,150
- just wait a... let go of me! stop it! - no.

888
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,380
God! please, god! where are you taking Marlena?

889
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:12,720
Wait a second.

890
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,230
It's over. there is nothing you can do.

891
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,430
There is nothing you can do for her now. it is over. it's over.

892
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,040
- rogers, clear out of here. - you sure?

893
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,170
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

894
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,810
- let's move out. - oh, my god.

895
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,720
What just happened?

896
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,120
Let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.

897
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,320
- come on. come on. - okay.

898
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,450
- let's go. move. - okay, okay.

899
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,960
Let's go, move. come on.

900
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,030
You gotta listen to me.

901
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,330
This girl, her building, it's at columbus circle?

902
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,240
- yeah? - lf you wanna go out in this,

903
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,610
I ain't gonna stop you. but you gotta know something.

904
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,040
The government's considering the hammer down protocol,

905
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,980
Which means they're willing to let this whole area go.

906
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,710
- you mean midtown? - no, I mean manhattan.

907
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,790
Come on. we're taking one last shot at this thing.

908
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:14,860
- oh, god. - lf that doesn't work,

909
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,650
They're leveling the whole goddamned city.

910
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,030
- your watch is still working? - yeah?

911
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,720
All right. the airlifts are leaving from 40th and park.

912
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,490
Last chopper's wheels-up at exactly 0600.

913
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,400
If you can make it there, then they'll get you out.

914
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,200
- okay. okay, thank you. - 58th street's right there.

915
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,070
- now, go. move, move, move. - let's go.

916
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,340
- let's go. - go, go, go.

917
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,740
- this is like a nightmare, you know. - it all happened so fast,

918
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,750
I couldn't even really see what happened to her.

919
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,820
I mean, did you see it? could you see what happened, Hud?

920
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,750
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then they were screaming she was bitten.

921
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,150
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding. and then...

922
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,760
Hud.

923
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,330
- you okay? - yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

924
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,900
Look, guys, I don't mean to be... but we don't have a lot of time.

925
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,000
Okay, so maybe you guys should just stay here, and I'll go.

926
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,410
All right?

927
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,110
- I'm sorry. I just... - no, no, we're coming. we're coming.

928
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,350
Are you sure?

929
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,010
No, no, man. no, we have to do this, okay?

930
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,590
We're with you. let's go. let's go. let's go right now.

931
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,400
- oh, my god. oh, my god. - what?

932
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,940
- oh, my god. - what is it? what?

933
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,810
- shit. - that's not Beth's place, is it?

934
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,850
- oh, my god. - is that Beth's apartment?

935
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:51,350
- oh, my god. - Rob. is that her place?

936
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,650
- tell me that's not her place. - that's her place, yeah.

937
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,720
Oh, shit. I don't suppose she lives on the ground floor.

938
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,990
No, 39th.

939
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,790
- oh, great. - how do we even get up there?

940
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,860
I don't know. we just go inside and then see how high we can get.

941
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,760
I don't know if I can do that.

942
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:13,860
Well, maybe we could try going up the other building,

943
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,710
And then see if there's a place to cross over onto her roof.

944
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,970
And then we could find some way down to her place.

945
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,520
Wait. no, never mind. no, that's a bad idea.

946
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,050
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

947
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:30,780
No one ever listens to me, ever. and now, of course, they listen to me.

948
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:31,880
Great.

949
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,460
Shit. shit.

950
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,700
Probably not working.

951
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,170
- what's going on? - not working.

952
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,570
Wait, wait. let's just... maybe...

953
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,630
- no? no? - shit.

954
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,300
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

955
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,670
You guys see that guy's face when Lily asked him what it was?

956
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,880
I mean, they have no idea.

957
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:01,850
- unless they're, like, in on it. - jesus, Hud.

958
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,290
I don't read the papers.

959
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,050
- maybe our government made this thing. - oh, yeah.

960
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,820
I mean, you know, maybe it was an accident,

961
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,260
- or maybe it was on purpose... - sure, maybe they did.

962
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,190
- does it really matter right now? - yeah.

963
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,130
It matters because I need to talk about something.

964
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,940
Otherwise, I'm actually probably going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

965
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,780
I'm sorry.

966
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,010
Hey, wait, wait. you guys hear that? you guys hear that?

967
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,810
- yes. - yeah.

968
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,320
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

969
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,750
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

970
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,830
Okay.

971
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,040
Okay, like, I think it's like, two more up, I think.

972
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,100
Okay.

973
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,600
Guys, guys, guys.

974
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,840
This one, it's got to be. it's got to be this one.

975
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,950
Oh, god.

976
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,460
I don't think there's anybody here. no.

977
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,370
- oh, jesus. - oh, my god.

978
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,810
- oh, my god. - okay.

979
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,880
Okay, now, we can do this. we can totally do this.

980
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,470
- I don't know, Rob. - look, it's a straight shot.

981
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,880
- I don't know. I'm sorry. - Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

982
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:41,150
Look, it's a straight shot. we could use... there's pipes there.

983
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,350
We could use the air conditioners. okay?

984
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,960
Come on. we came this far. we can do it. I'll go first.

985
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,030
- okay, okay, okay. yes. - all right? okay.

986
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:52,090
- okay, I'll document it. - be careful, okay?

987
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:56,260
- come on. come on. - okay. okay.

988
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,200
Okay. Hud, come on! put the camera down! come on!

989
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,780
Oh, jesus.

990
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,210
- okay. all right. okay. - I'll go first.

991
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:11,910
All right. if this is the last thing you see, that means I died.

992
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,510
- Hud, come on! - okay.

993
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,040
Look out! oh, shit...

994
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,500
Okay.

995
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,200
- okay. okay. - shit.

996
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,170
- okay. okay. - oh, god.

997
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,130
- yes. okay. you all right? - yeah.

998
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,290
We're almost there, come on.

999
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,200
Come on, Hud.

1000
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,960
Shit.

1001
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:13,310
Beth! Beth! Beth!

1002
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,790
- can you get it? - do you need help?

1003
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,790
Do you need help? or...

1004
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,060
Beth? Beth?

1005

Oh, my god. oh, my god. Beth.

Oh, my god. oh, my god.

1012
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,670
Can you hear me? Beth.

1013
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,430

You came back for me.

1017
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,970
Of course I came back for you.

1018
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,080
- I'm sorry it took me so long. - no, it's okay.

1019
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:02,650
Okay, okay, okay. you're okay. we're gonna get you out of here, okay?

1020
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,320

1025
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,730
- please don't do that. - it's gonna be over in a second.

1028
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,670
We're gonna do it real slow.

1029
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,440
- easy, easy, just wait. - no, don't.

1030

- one, two, three. - one, two, three.

1031
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,880

I know, I know, I know it hurts. I know it hurts.

1036
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,630
What is that?

01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,740

Just hold on to me. you're gonna be all right.

Oh, my god.

Go, just go. just go, go, go. go. just get to the other side.

1055
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,820
Come on, just keep moving.

1056
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,130
Oh, my god.

- oh, shit! - oh, my god!

1058

- oh, god. - go! go!

1061
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,180
Run! run! hurry!

1062
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:16,380
- Rob, come on! - oh, my god.

1063
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,270
Oh, my god.

1064
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,270
- what the hell was that? - I don't know.

1065
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,640
Something else also terrible.

1066
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,870
Rob, what time do the choppers take off?

1067
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,810
- 0600. - what time is that?

1068
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,480
- 6:00, hud. - yeah, okay. I knew that.

1069

- come on, come on. - okay.

1070
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:27,900
Wait up!

1071
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,870
- did we make it? - we want to get out of here, come on.

1072
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,470
Let's go! let's go!

1073
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,740

Oh, god. those aren't gonna hit us, are they?

1090
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,600
Oh, my god. they hit it! they just hit it right now!

Target down. target down. target down. he's down.

1094
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:28,910

Yeah, yeah, yeah! that's the shit right there!

01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,660
Jesus christ, I'm sorry.

01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,290

01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,240
Sirens will sound two minutes out.

1106
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,140
If you can hear those sirens, you're in the blasting zone.

1107
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:36,470
Come on. come on. Hud. Hud, are you okay?

1108

Hud, come over to the other side.

1114
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,830
You've got to pull him up. come on, come on.

1115
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,960
- okay, okay. - I don't think I can move.

1116
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,560
Yes, you can. don't say that.

1117
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:00,940
Copy your last, we're on the move.

1118
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,700
- here, take his hand. take his hand. - good luck.

1119
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:05,400
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I got it. come on, come on.

1120
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,210
I got his legs, go!

1121
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,550
- my leg! - I know. I know, I know. I know.

1122
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,990
It's okay, you're fine. you're good. you're okay. you're okay.

1123
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,500
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding, okay? okay?

1124
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,930
I'm not okay. I'm not gonna be able to walk.

1125
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:27,470
You are going to be able to walk.

1126
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,970
Don't do it.

1127
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:35,640
Okay. all right, listen, we got to get out of here, okay?

1128
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,870
Well, which way do we go?

1129
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,100
We have to get away from here, because I think it's gonna explode.

1130
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:42,050
- okay, okay. okay. - all right? come on. let's go.

1131
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:44,620
Let's go this way. come on. come on, you can walk. okay.

1132
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,910
Come on. hold on, wait a second.

1133
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,010
- Hud! - Hud!

1134
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,180
What? oh! oh, no!

1135
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:55,280
- Hud! Hud! - Hud, what are you doing?

1136
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:05,630
Hud!

1137
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:26,960
Hud!

1138
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,450
Hud!

1139
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,670
Hud!

1140
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,960
Hud! Hud!

1141
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:39,970
Hud! Hud!

1142
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,640
Hud! Hud!

1143
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,870
Hud!

1144
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,880
He's gone.

1145
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,120
He's gone.

1146
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,360
- they're all gone. - I know.

1147
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:43,900
We gotta go. we gotta go. we gotta get out of here.

1148
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,060
Where? there's nowhere to go to.

1149
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:49,400
We got to go. he's coming towards us.

1150
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:52,540
No, we should just wait here. just wait here.

1151
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:55,340
Listen, we wait here, they'll find us, all right?

1152
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:58,110
They're fighting him right now. if we wait here, they'll find us.

1153
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,310
No, we can't stay.

1154
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,720
It's okay. it's okay.

1155
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,960
- I'm so scared. - I know. I know. I know.

1156
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:42,960
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1157
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:47,830
It's 6:42 a.m. on saturday, may 23.

1158
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:52,470
Approximately seven hours ago, something attacked the city.

1159
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,910
I don't know what it is.

1160
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,230
If you found this tape... I mean, if you're watching this right now,

1161
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:01,180
Then you probably know more about it than I do.

1162
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,080
Whatever it is, it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

1163
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,250
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt, and Marlena Diamond,

1164
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,150
And many, many others.

1165
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:15,700
We've crashed here in central park and taken shelter under this bridge.

1166
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,130
The military has begun bombing the creature

1167
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:20,290
And we're caught in the middle.

1168
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,290
Okay. ready?

1169
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,310
It's okay.

1170
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,350
- Beth, look at me. - I don't know what to say.

1171
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,940
Well, just tell them who you are.

1172
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:44,780
My name is Elizabeth Mclntyre. I don't know why this is happening.

1173
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,500
But we're gonna wait here until this passes.

1174
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:55,960
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1175
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,450
Look at me, Beth. look at me. look at me.

1176
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,880
- I love you. - I love you.

1177
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,250
I know what I'm talking about. come on, admit it.

1178
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,020
You are going to miss me a little bit, right?

1179
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,560
Yeah, we'll see.

1180
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,460
Okay, yeah, all right.

1181
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,930
All right, we're almost out of tape. we got, like, three seconds left.

1182
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,160
What do you wanna say? what do you wanna say?

1183
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,390
Last thing to the camera.

1184
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,470
I had a good day.
