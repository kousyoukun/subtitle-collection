1
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,477
It's 6:42 a.m.

2
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,347
Beth's Dad's place.

3
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:00,990
He's out of town.

4
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:07,999
And it's already a good day.

5
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,868
Beth.

6
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:46,608
-Rob, what are you doing?
-Nothing.

7
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,336
-Well, then stop.
-Nothing.

8
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:50,378
-That's...
-Stop it.

9
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,844
She's shy.

10
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:55,208
I could just see this
ending up on the Internet.

11
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:57,878
Well, fine, cover up. See if I care.

12
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:01,013
-I'm interested in other things.
-Like what?

13
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,425
Like you.

14
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:13,299
-Oh, man.
-That was close.

15
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:16,794
Do it really... I'm scared of it.

16
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,874
-It's only 30 minutes out.
-Shut up. I've never been.

17
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:20,636
You've never been to Coney Island?

18
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,233
Oh, how have you
never been to Coney Island?

19
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,040
I don't know, I just... I've never been.

20
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:26,011
Oh, that's... It's so much fun.
I'm taking you. We're going.

21
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:27,343
Oh, my God.
You're so excited about this.

22
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,542
-Yeah, I can't wait to...
-Give me this.

23
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,879
What are you doing? What?

24
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:31,715
Oh, all right. Well,
then from the neck up, okay?

25
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,379
That's the only way I consent to this.

26
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,979
Oh, please, Rob,
nobody's paying for that online.

27
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,956
You've never been to
Twelve-Chest-Hairs. com, have you?

28
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:40,119
-Okay. What else?
-What else, what?

29
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,322
Other than cotton candy
and Tilt-A-Whirls?

30
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:46,367
-What do you want to do today?
-lf I answer that...

31
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:48,865
-All right, is this thing on?
-Look out!

32
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:49,995
Babe, it's not my camera.

33
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,733
I don't know if it's the on button
or the zoom button.

34
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,468
All right. Here, here, here.
I think I got it. Is this on?

35
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:56,170
Oh, perfect. And now we can have
a nice record of you getting run over.

36
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,803
Is that funny?

37
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:00,506
What time is everybody
starting to show up?

38
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,640
-It's getting late here.
-A couple hours.

39
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,584
-That's why we have to hurry.
-Where are we going?

40
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:07,850
We're going... We're just going
around the corner to the store!

41
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:10,149
I want you to go around
with your brother's camera

42
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,124
and get testimonials from everyone.

43
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:14,560
Why? I mean,
it's not like this is a wedding.

44
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:17,792
I know it's not a wedding.
I said like a wedding.

45
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,601
I can't get this.

46
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:22,136
I don't get... I mean,
I don't understand why I have to do it.

47
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:24,900
'Cause, I mean, I don't...
I don't even know how to work this...

48
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,134
-That's what I think is gonna happen.
-No, I'm not!

49
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,540
-You totally are. You...
-You have no clue!

50
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,669
Okay, well, let me ask you a question.

51
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,112
Can you see me through the viewfinder?

52
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:34,842
Yeah. Got you.

53
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,544
Good. Now can you see me trying
to carry these bags all by myself?

54
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,915
You're doing a great job.

55
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:41,353
Here, practice doing two things at once.

56
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:43,322
-That's good! That was good.
-Thank you.

57
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:44,450
I'm not lugging this thing around

58
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,549
-all night long.
-He is your brother.

59
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,719
This is important. Stop freaking out.

60
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,818
I understand that, Lily, but it's a shit job!

61
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,625
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is! I'm not doing it!

62
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:51,927
Jason, I have been planning this
for two weeks!

63
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,524
-All I want you to do is help me.
-Okay, babe, babe.

64
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:56,503
Okay. All right? I'll do it. It's fine.

65
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,205
I really pissed her off.

66
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:03,310
Babe, come on.
I was just kidding! Come on!

67
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:07,437
Hud? Hud, listen to me.
I got a job for you.

68
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,142
I already have got a job.

69
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,377
-I'm doing the sign, so...
-Yeah, no. I see that,

70
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:13,512
but this is more important than the sign.
You know how, like, at weddings,

71
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,954
people give testimonials
to the camera, right?

72
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:17,218
No.

73
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:21,393
All right. You're gonna take the camera
and just, you know, go around the party

74
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,294
and film people wishing Rob good luck.

75
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,423
I don't know, man.

76
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,830
-That's a lot of responsibility.
-This is important.

77
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:26,924
And then you have
to do it the whole night...

78
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,027
And Marlena's gonna be here.

79
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,162
-She is?
-Oh, yeah. She is.

80
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,500
-So you're gonna take that.
-Oh, hold on.

81
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:32,869
-And you're gonna talk to her...
-I didn't...

82
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,670
-For Rob.
-I didn't say I would do it.

83
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:35,869
-Just try it out.
-All right, I'll do a few.

84
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:38,071
You can, just do mine...

85
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,306
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, go.

86
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,780
All right.

87
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:44,078
Rob, I don't even know what to say, bro.

88
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,313
Best of luck in Japan.
I love you so much,

89
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:48,652
and I'm proud of you.

90
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:52,323
-That's it.
-That's it?

91
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:56,558
-Yeah. Easy enough.
-Yeah. It's actually kind of fun.

92
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,992
-You enjoy it, Hud.
-Thanks, man.

93
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,160
Yeah, I'm doing...

94
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,697
Hey, what's up, man?

95
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:05,569
Hey, guys? Hey.

96
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:07,598
-What do we say?
-Anything.

97
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,077
<i>Bon voyage,</i> Rob.
Or however you say that in Japanese.

98
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:15,450
Yeah, good.
Oh, yeah, all right. Oh, yeah...

99
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,815
-Hud, what are you doing?
-I'm documenting the night.

100
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,649
But I thought I asked Jason to do that.

101
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,191
Oh, yeah, well, Jason asked me to do it,
so I've been doing it.

102
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,418
I've been doing it really well.

103
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:25,789
Well, are you gonna
take it seriously, though?

104
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,260
Because it's really important.

105
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,627
No, of course. I've been taking it
really, really seriously.

106
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:30,756
-Very seriously.
-You promise?

107
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,528
Yeah, you wanna do
your testimonial now?

108
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,266
-Okay.
-Yeah, do it right now.

109
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:36,360
Okay.

110
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:38,030
Okay, just open up to him,
'cause this is gonna be

111
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,942
-the last thing he sees you...
-Okay, Hud, I got it.

112
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:40,271
-the last thing he sees you...
-Okay, Hud, I got it.

113
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:42,105
Robert Hawkins,

114
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:45,408
I can't believe you're leaving me
to look after your brother by myself.

115
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:49,473
Oh! Easy, easy. I mean
I'm obviously standing right here...

116
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:52,418
And I know we're not officially family,
yet, but...

117
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:54,182
-Not fair, 'cause I'm gonna...
-Dude.

118
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,451
-Okay.
-I'll cut him out later.

119
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:01,587
But I think of you as my brother,
and I hope you think of me as a sister.

120
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:04,029
So, you better call us.

121
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:08,697
Now that you have this job,
you can afford to call us, so...

122
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,704
-Hud?
-Yeah.

123
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,535
Yeah, sorry. No, you're good.
You're good. You're good.

124
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,608
-That was good!
-That's it?

125
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,698
I thought that was really, really good.

126
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,801
Yeah, but you weren't even paying
attention for...

127
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:30,058
Okay. Okay, you can do this.

128
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:35,260
Yeah. You got this, man. You got this.

129
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,003
-What's up, man?
-Hey, what's up, dude?

130
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:44,197
What's up?

131
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,139
Excuse me! Hey, Marlena?

132
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:53,181
-Hey, what's up?
-Hi. Hi.

133
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:54,909
Hey, did you know that I'm going around

134
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,577
the party and I'm...
Do you know Rob's leaving?

135
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,984
-Like it's his going-away party.
-Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:05,356
Cool. Hey, so we're taping,
I think, people talking about him.

137
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,191
Oh, no, thank you.
I barely even know Rob.

138
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:10,663
I'm just coming to say hi to Lily,
so it's a little weird,

139
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,199
if I'm even on it, I think, but thanks.

140
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:15,134
Okay, cool,
except I'm supposed to get everybody.

141
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:18,138
So have you ever been to a wedding?

142
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,403
No, I get what you're doing. I just...
I don't want to do it, but thank you.

143
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,809
Okay, cool.
We'll just do a short one real quick.

144
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,081
Okay.

145
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,889
Hey, Rob, Marlena.

146
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:39,725
I think we've met, like,
probably three times before, total,

147
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,922
and every one of those times
I was really drunk,

148
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:46,001
so I don't really even know what to say.

149
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:47,966
But you have a cool job!
That's something!

150
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,300
-Like you're president of something!
-Vice president!

151
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:51,839
Also really cool.

152
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:55,001
So good luck with that
and we're gonna be here

153
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,443
keeping New York really safe
and fun for you when you come back.

154
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:00,412
-Cool, that was a really good one.
-Yeah?

155
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:02,143
Yeah, we can do
another one if you want.

156
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:04,983
Do you actually have,
like a card or something?

157
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,250
Well, my agency... We're leaving.
We're going on this stupid retreat

158
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:09,585
and they like all this video,

159
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:11,125
-like, bonding crap.
-Oh, yeah. I'm actually...

160
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:12,887
-I'm not a professional.
-What?

161
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,555
-I'm not a professional. I'm Hud.
-Hug?

162
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:19,122
No, no, no, Hud.
I'm Rob and Lily's friend.

163
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:22,533
-We met, like, several times before.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

164
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:24,663
Yeah, you have the camera
in front of your face,

165
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,502
-it's probably why I didn't...
-Okay, here. If I move it?

166
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,770
-Oh, yeah. What's going on? Totally.
-Yeah.

167
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:30,640
Yeah, cool. It's nice to see you again.

168
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:34,807
-Really good to see you. Really good.
-So what have you been up to?

169
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,078
I actually... I'm gonna just go
grab some food,

170
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:38,380
but good luck with the...

171
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:41,115
I could still do your
agency's retreat if you wanted...

172
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,990
He's coming up the stairs right now.
Everybody get ready. Get ready.

173
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,857
Can someone turn down
the music, please?

174
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,196
Surprise! Surprise!

175
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:58,501
No, no, no, no, no, no!

176
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:02,270
How did you guys plan all this?

177
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,812
Easy, you're naive. Let's go.

178
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,437
-Hey. How are you?
-Take this. Take this.

179
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,675
-I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you.
-What's up?

180
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,911
Oh, hey. Yes. Good.

181
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,317
-What's up, man?
-Speech!

182
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:15,447
-Yeah, speech! Speech!
-Speech! Speech!

183
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,329
-Oh, this is very surprising...
-I hope so.

184
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,057
-Obviously.
-It's a surprise party.

185
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,393
Yeah.

186
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:28,594
But it's very sweet. So thank you. Lily?

187
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:29,796
It was everyone. It was everyone.

188
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:33,272
No, thank you, everyone.
Thank you. It's...

189
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:37,209
Oh, it means a lot, so... That's it.
That's all I got. I don't know.

190
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:40,076
-Have a good time!
-Yeah, party!

191
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,342
Yeah!

192
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,849
-Hey, man. Were you surprised?
-Yo. I was, like, not even surprised.

193
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:48,752
No? Can you describe your current
emotions right now?

194
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,418
I don't know. I would say blas?
Like, I'm a little... I'm just a little bored.

195
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,964
-No, you're not. Well, congrats.
-No, man, that was awesome, dude.

196
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:57,498
What are you doing
with the video camera

197
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,623
-by the way?
-I'm documenting the night

198
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,224
so that you can take it
to Japan with you.

199
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:01,393
Oh, can I watch it every night

200
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,470
-when I get there?
-Jason asked if I...

201
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,560
-Yeah, you could.
-Oh, good.

202
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:06,471
All right, thank you. Cool.

203
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,004
Hey, Hud, do you know
if Beth's coming tonight?

204
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:13,570
Yeah, I guess. I'm sure Lily invited her.
Why wouldn't she be here?

205
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,361
So how are you
gonna survive without Rob?

206
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,126
-He's like your main dude.
-Yeah, I know.

207
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,791
Hey, how am I gonna
survive without you?

208
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,495
-I don't know. I'm like your main dude.
-Straight up.

209
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:41,131
-As I make my... I'm not here.
-Hi, Hud.

210
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,336
I'm just documenting. Not here.

211
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:45,037
That was my biggest problem
is that she picked him...

212
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,843
You know what.
No, but when he said <i>My Fair Lady...</i>

213
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,851
-I love <i>My Fair Lady.</i>
-I was like, "Really?"

214
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:54,013
That was wonderful.
But, I mean, it worked out, right?

215
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:57,524
Beth, hey! You made it.

216
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,253
It doesn't matter, dude, you're here.
All is well.

217
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:00,419
Oh, no, it's good. It's good.

218
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:04,124
-Enjoy it. Have fun.
-Oh, I will. I'm just gonna go say...

219
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,567
-Who is that guy?
-I don't know. He's random.

220
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:09,193
Here, I'm gonna go check it out.
Look out, documenting.

221
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:10,271
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,532
-I missed your surprise.
-Oh, that's okay.

223
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,802
I'm sorry. No, we had cab problems.
I'm really sorry.

224
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,468
-That's fine.
-Decorating's mine.

225
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:19,672
-No, that's fantastic.
-Rob, this is Travis.

226
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:20,908
-Hi.
-Hi. Oh, pleasure.

227
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,347
I've heard a lot about you.

228
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,975
-Congratulations, by the way.
-Thank you.

229
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,519
-Vice President. That's fantastic.
-I love your dress.

230
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,952
-Thank you. I love yours.
-Yeah, thank you.

231
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:28,682
That's really amazing.

232
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,917
-Should we...
-Yeah, there's a buffet.

233
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,959
Hey, I'm documenting the night.
I'm Hud.

234
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,288
-Okay.
-So, there's tons of sake.

235
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:35,158
Yeah, just help yourselves, enjoy.

236
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:36,561
-Enjoy, everybody.
-It's good to meet you.

237
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:39,566
-Have a good one, yeah.
-Thanks for coming.

238
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,103
-I think he just said I was cute.
-Are they dating?

239
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:43,296
Yeah.

240
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,189
-Hey, is everything cool, man?
-Yeah, everything's cool.

241
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:10,561
Okay, because... I don't know,
because you been over here kind of...

242
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,725
Is that my camera?

243
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,268
I don't know. Your brother gave it to me.

244
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,599
Did you switch the tape?
Because I had a tape in there.

245
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:17,729
I don't know. Was...

246
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,439
Roller-coasters are fun, but, like,
any kind of tea-cuppy thing...

247
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,568
Tape was in here when I got it. Why?

248
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,179
-Rob, why?
-No, it doesn't matter.

249
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,216
It doesn't... It's stupid.

250
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:31,616
Okay, are you sure you're cool?
Because you're really weirding me out.

251
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,848
Like, we haven't been
hanging out or anything.

252
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,121
-Here. Here, man. Come on.
-All right, cool. That's more like it.

253
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:41,719
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

254
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,999
-What's wrong with you?
-Hey, Beth! Beth. Beth. Beth.

255
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,534
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

256
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,799
Hey, I'm filming goodbyes for Rob.
Do you want to say something?

257
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:53,773
Oh, Hud, I don't know.
It's not a really good time right now.

258
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,968
Come on, he's leaving.

259
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:56,374
-I mean, can we...
-I know.

260
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:57,775
You're not gonna be able
to talk to him for a while.

261
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,246
Isn't there something you wanna say?

262
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,916
You know what?
Travis, can you get me a drink?

263
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,885
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
-Is that... Okay.

264
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:08,479
Cool, thanks.

265
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,849
Okay, let's... Right here? I don't...

266
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,484
-No, we can do it in the kitchen.
-Okay, perfect.

267
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:14,687
Okay.

268
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:17,791
Okay.

269
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:21,264
Rob,

270
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,063
I didn't want to do this on camera.

271
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:32,613
But, I just... I just want you to know
how happy I am for you,

272
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:36,408
because I know how hard
you've worked for this job

273
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:39,180
and I know how much it means
to you and...

274
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,685
And I'm really gonna miss you.

275
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,993
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

276
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:57,160
Jason? There's something totally weird
going on with Rob and Beth.

277
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,365
-What are you talking about?
-I'm serious. They're right outside.

278
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:02,170
-Hud! Not now.
-Okay. I'll check it out.

279
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:03,938
You never even called me, Rob!

280
00:15:04,046 --> 00:15:05,536
You go and bring some guy to my party?

281
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,877
Hold on! You haven't
talked to me in weeks!

282
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:09,684
-Hud, man! Come on!
-Sorry!

283
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,151
-What? What?
-I got it. I got it. Hud, get back inside.

284
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:15,087
-But I'm documenting!
-Not this.

285
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,886
Lily, do you know what
they were fighting about?

286
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:19,824
Lily, if you know,
you have to tell me. Lily.

287
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm not telling you.

288
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,723
I really should know,
as the guy documenting this.

289
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:24,821
She was the one
who brought me back inside.

290
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,992
-Okay, fine. We'll go find out.
-I'm positive. I promise.

291
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,967
-We'll ask her. We'll go find out.
-She's in the kitchen.

292
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,971
-What?
-Lil!

293
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,374
Lil, do you have something to tell us?

294
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,533
-No.
-You do, don't you?

295
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,610
-What? No.
-Hud, you're a genius.

296
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:37,941
-You're dodging the question right now.
-There is nothing to tell you.

297
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,035
-Nothing.
-Liar.

298
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,808
Lily, if you know something,
you have to tell us.

299
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,905
-No.
-Look at me.

300
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:44,110
-Lily.
-I know you. Babe.

301
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,485
Okay, fine, but not on camera.
I'm not telling you on camera.

302
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:48,851
Okay, that's not a problem.
All right, no problem.

303
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,447
Why would we say anything?

304
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,049
-We won't say anything.
-Rob and Beth slept together.

305
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,821
-Are you serious?
-It happened a few weeks ago.

306
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,396
Beth made me promise
not to say anything.

307
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,486
Are you kidding me, Lily?

308
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:58,225
Rob and Beth sleep together,
you're not gonna tell me?

309
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,598
-Why wouldn't you tell me?
-Why wouldn't I tell you?

310
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,734
Okay, you guys,
don't ask me where I heard this.

311
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,501
Rob and Beth totally had sex together.

312
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,406
-I knew it.
-Are you kidding me?

313
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,501
No, I'm not kidding.
This is extremely serious.

314
00:16:11,246 --> 00:16:12,235
Hey, Marlena.

315
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,712
-It's me, Hud, from before.
-Hi. Right.

316
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:16,409
Did you know
that Rob and Beth had sex?

317
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,076
-No.
-Yeah, isn't that crazy?

318
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,244
-They've been friends forever.
-Crazy.

319
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,413
I mean, Rob's been in love
with her since college.

320
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,981
Well, maybe it was like
a going-away present, you know?

321
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:27,994
Yeah. Wait, were we supposed
to get presents?

322
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:29,791
-They did. They had sexual intercourse.
-What?

323
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:30,990
-Lily told me.
-No way.

324
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:32,157
-No, you are so...
-No, I promise.

325
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:33,256
Why do you make up stuff like that?

326
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,699
-No, I do not. I have a nice car.
-You make shit up.

327
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,668
I didn't say what kind...

328
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:37,932
Hey.

329
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:50,181
-Good luck in Japan, Rob.
-Good luck tonight, Travis.

330
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:56,257
Hey, dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Are you all right, man?

331
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,121
-Hey. Come on.
-This is not the time, Hud.

332
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,454
-What is it, man?
-Let him go.

333
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,358
-We should talk to him.
-We're not talking to him.

334
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:02,657
I could talk to him now.

335
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:04,391
Dude, you already talked
to the whole party!

336
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:06,831
...have to do something.
-No. Everyone needs to just calm down

337
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,027
-and give him space.
-He's just gonna stay

338
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:09,831
-Locked in his room all night?
-Lily, look at you.

339
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:11,633
-It's fine, trust me.
-It is not fine.

340
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,332
-It is fine.
-You are his brother.

341
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,775
You are his best friend.
Go and make him happy.

342
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:19,438
So, how do you wanna do this?
Do you wanna do most of the talking,

343
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:20,981
or do you want me
to do most of the talking?

344
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,017
-You're not doing any talking.
-Okay, cool.

345
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:24,176
We got to talk.

346
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:25,275
You don't know
what you're talking about,

347
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,548
-all right?
-Okay, well, then tell me.

348
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:29,886
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

349
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:32,221
Yeah, well, Beth told Lori
that after you guys got together,

350
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,726
-you totally blew her off.
-I didn't blow her off!

351
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:34,818
She said you never called her.

352
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,421
Look, I'm leaving, all right?
So what am I supposed to do?

353
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:39,090
I don't know, man.
She was heartbroken.

354
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,602
Look, there's no "together." It's just
her and me, two separate things.

355
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:43,796
It's better if we just stay friends.

356
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,566
...not that I feel like I'm not
good enough for her!

357
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:47,608
No, stop, stop!
I didn't say "feel," Rob.

358
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,301
You're not good enough for her.

359
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:52,244
That's it. That's fact. That's science.

360
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:55,976
Beth McIntyre is, like,
from a whole 'nother planet, man.

361
00:17:56,084 --> 00:18:00,077
She's beautiful. She's charming.
And you... I love you,

362
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:02,418
but let's face it,
you're kind of a douche bag.

363
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:07,188
And going to Japan is not gonna fix that.
She's crazy about you, bro.

364
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,492
-Like, right now, as you are.
-And you're in love with her.

365
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,260
-But you got to go after her.
-It's not that simple.

366
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,597
-No, it is that simple, Rob.
-Come on, man. Don't be scared.

367
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:16,864
It's about moments, man.
That's all that...

368
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,236
You got to learn to say,
"Forget the world,"

369
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,866
and hang on to the people
that you care about the most.

370
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:26,909
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. What the hell was that?

371
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,712
That scared the shit out of me.

372
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,381
Lil! Lil!

373
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,253
Did you feel that?
It was like an earthquake.

374
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,417
-You guys...
-Lil, where are you?

375
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,256
-What was that?
-What was that?

376
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:41,852
-Hey. Are you all right?
-Oh, my God.

377
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:43,294
-Yeah, that was really scary.
-Did you see anything?

378
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:46,060
Hey, Marlena! Marlena, are you okay?

379
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,294
Guys, look out!

380
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:49,463
-Okay.
-It was like a bomb.

381
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,596
All right, here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

382
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,765
Wait. Everyone quiet down. All right?

383
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,035
-<i>But now, just approximately...</i>
-Shut up, shut up.

384
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,611
-<i>... 15 minutes after word...</i>
-Guys! Come on.

385
00:18:57,712 --> 00:19:00,146
<i>... of a possible earthquake</i>
<i>in lower Manhattan.</i>

386
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:05,481
<i>Nearby, in New York Harbor, we're</i>
<i>getting word of an oil tanker capsizing</i>

387
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:09,045
<i>in the middle of the harbor</i>
<i>near the Statue of Liberty.</i>

388
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:10,590
-<i>Once again...</i>
-Dude, that's really close.

389
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,853
-<i>... there's no way to know if any...</i>
-That's really, really close.

390
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,861
That's true. Do you think
we could see something from the roof?

391
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:17,431
-I don't know. Maybe.
-J, wanna go to the roof?

392
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,658
Let's go see if we can see
something on the roof.

393
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:19,961
Come on, Jason.
We're not going up to the roof.

394
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:23,162
-Yeah, let's go up there.
-I don't think we should.

395
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,636
-No!
-That was really...

396
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:29,310
What do you think?
Think it's another terrorist attack?

397
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:32,312
-It's insane, man.
-Watch your step.

398
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:43,323
It was shaking everywhere, man.
Just like tremors.

399
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:46,053
-Yeah, it's on the news downstairs.
-Is this the only lights that went out?

400
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:47,719
-I think they blew up the trains.
-No, a couple did.

401
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:52,129
-Some stayed on.
-Oh, man. What is going on?

402
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,293
Maybe you should've left town
a little bit earlier, right?

403
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,664
Shut up.

404
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,537
Oh, my God!

405
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,868
No, no, no.

406
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:04,874
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

407
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,475
Hud. Move. Hud!

408
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:27,832
Oh, God.

409
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,262
-Rob, you got a set of keys?
-Get out of here!

410
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,931
Right, did you look back?
Did anybody get hurt?

411
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:37,739
-Did anybody see Jason or not?
-I don't know.

412
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,838
Did anybody see Jason?
Has anybody seen Jason?

413
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,747
-Did anybody see Jason?
-Is he inside?

414
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:51,183
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, shit!

415
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,227
Oh, Jesus Christ!

416
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:57,594
-Oh, God! Oh, God!
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

417
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:01,367
Oh, my God!

418
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:14,740
You gotta take your stuff
and we gotta get out of here, man!

419
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,043
I'm telling you!

420
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,948
-I'm so sorry.
-Where were you?

421
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:29,489
Hey, did you guys see that?
Did you guys just see that?

422
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:44,603
Go! Let's go!

423
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:52,514
-Hey, get down! Get down!
-You all right? You all right?

424
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,087
Yeah, did you guys see that?

425
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,556
-Did you guys see that?
-You all right?

426
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,423
There are people still out there.

427
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:16,377
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob, I saw it! Rob!

428
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,136
-Rob.
-What?

429
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:20,214
-Rob, I saw it!
-What?

430
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:22,374
-What's he saying?
-It's alive.

431
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:35,591
Stay down, Lily! Get back!

432
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:44,562
He's going away now.

433
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:47,031
-Jason, what are you doing?
-Jason, where are you going?

434
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:48,769
Lily, just wait.

435
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:52,142
-Jason, don't go out...
-Jason, don't!

436
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,578
Lily, just wait here!

437
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,706
Hey, Rob! Rob!
Where's he going, dude?

438
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:58,718
-Jason!
-Rob. Rob!

439
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:22,540
-Oh, my God. Marlena?
-Oh, God.

440
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:26,045
Are you okay?
Wait, come here. Come here. Sit down.

441
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:49,298
It walked right through
that street over there.

442
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:51,895
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It walked right over my head.

443
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:55,066
-What?
-That's the sound it's making.

444
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:57,371
You said you saw something, right?
So what did you see?

445
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,743
-You said it was alive? What was it?
-Who cares what it...

446
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:03,545
I don't know, man. I don't know.
I mean, I was taping. I can show you.

447
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,676
Hey, you guys! I have it on tape!

448
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:08,915
-Well, then rewind it. Rewind it.
-Yeah. Here, here. Let me rewind it...

449
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:10,351
It's gonna be a great opportunity for you.

450
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,948
Yeah, but I don't even
speak the language.

451
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,493
Oh, come on. How hard could it be?

452
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:16,428
It's Japanese. It's Japanese-hard.

453
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,363
-It'll be fine.
-Do you really think I should go?

454
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:23,370
-Oh, my God.
-That makes no sense.

455
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:26,133
-That makes no sense.
-Did you see it?

456
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:28,368
I don't know what it was, of course!
It was giant.

457
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,876
It was like... Did you see that thing?

458
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,970
-I'm not yelling at you, all right?
-Yes, you are!

459
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:34,981
Hey, guys, guys, come on!
Everybody just calm down!

460
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,517
-Quiet, guys.
-All right. Come on, just shut up!

461
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:40,315
All right? We don't know what we saw!
The point is it's still here!

462
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:42,719
All right? So we need to get
the hell out of Manhattan!

463
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:44,451
-Now.
-Yeah, yeah.

464
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,254
And out to the Brooklyn Bridge.
I think it's the best plan.

465
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,295
-It's a straight shot to Delancey.
-Just take the Williamsburg.

466
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:50,364
No. Do you know how far that is?
Brooklyn is right there.

467
00:24:50,465 --> 00:24:52,956
No, no, no, dude. It's so much closer.
It's right here.

468
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:55,035
-Center Street's like a block away.
-What's going on?

469
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:57,730
I think we're gonna get out of here.
Is she okay to...

470
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,501
Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Marlena,
we're gonna get out of here, okay?

471
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:03,509
It was eating people.
It was eating everyone.

472
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:07,345
We gotta go! Go! Let's go!

473
00:25:07,782 --> 00:25:08,771
Okay, come here.

474
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:11,545
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-I don't think... Don't even look.

475
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:18,415
-Is anyone's phone working?
-What?

476
00:25:18,526 --> 00:25:19,959
-Hud, is your phone working?
-What?

477
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,621
-No...
-Shit! I left it in the apartment.

478
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,220
-There's no signal.
-You're not getting a signal either?

479
00:25:24,332 --> 00:25:25,663
No, no, come on.

480
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,496
-Hud, come on!
-What? Okay.

481
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:39,273
It's all right.

482
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:40,436
Let's go.

483
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:41,815
We need an IV.

484
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,042
-Calm down, please.
-Let's go, people.

485
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:44,448
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Excuse me, Officer.

486
00:25:44,552 --> 00:25:46,110
Do you know...
What was that thing? What was it?

487
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,778
Look, if you're not injured,
you got to keep moving, man.

488
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:50,722
Let's go! Let's go, people! Let's go!

489
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:53,191
Yeah, once we get to the bridge,
we'll be safe.

490
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:56,195
Hey, how are you? Is she doing better?

491
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,026
She's okay. She's gonna be fine.

492
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:01,363
-Marlena, you saw it. What was that?
-Not now, Hud.

493
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:04,601
Sorry.

494
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,304
<i>Please go in an orderly manner.</i>

495
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:14,176
<i>Continue moving south</i>
<i>towards Brooklyn.</i>

496
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,910
-Just keep going.
-Yeah, I don't know. It got hit.

497
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:21,052
Once we get over there,
I'll go to my cousin's house.

498
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:22,782
She has a condo. She's out of town.

499
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:31,162
<i>I repeat, do not stop. Keep moving.</i>

500
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,497
<i>There will be instructions</i>
<i>on the Brooklyn side...</i>

501
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,672
<i>Get across the bridge.</i>
<i>Move in a quick and orderly fashion.</i>

502
00:26:50,952 --> 00:26:52,442
-You still filming?
-Yeah.

503
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:55,716
People are gonna wanna know
how it all went down.

504
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:58,457
Well, you can just tell them
how it all went down, Hud.

505
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,083
No, that wouldn't work.

506
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:03,686
People need to see this, you know?
This is gonna be important.

507
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:05,356
I mean, people are gonna watch this.

508
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:07,434
-Beth? Beth?
-Rob!

509
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,362
Beth, I've been trying to reach you.
Are you okay? Hello?

510
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,506
Wait a second, you guys!
Look, hey! Lily, stop!

511
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,779
I'm sorry. It's really loud here.
Can you speak up?

512
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:21,041
Lily!

513
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:24,578
-What?
-Rob got a hold of Beth.

514
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,551
Wait! Jason, wait!

515
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:28,745
-Rob's got Beth on the phone!
-What'd you say?

516
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,915
-What?
-Hey, y'all, come on.

517
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,617
Rob's got Beth on the phone!

518
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:35,560
Okay, Beth, you're gonna
have to calm down, okay?

519
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:38,860
Where are you?
What do you mean, you can't move?

520
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,801
-What?
-<i>I repeat, no panicking.</i>

521
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,241
Did you see it?

522
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:08,120
-Jason!
-Can you see anything?

523
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,662
No, I can't get over there!

524
00:28:09,764 --> 00:28:11,959
I can't... I can't see anything!
Can you see it?

525
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,727
Jason!

526
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:15,894
-Why did you stop?
-Jason!

527
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:17,994
-What?
-Jason, watch out!

528
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:27,938
Jason! No, Jason! No!

529
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:32,379
Jason!

530
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:38,351
-No, no! God! No, Jason! Jason!
-Lily, come on!

531
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:39,983
Jason! No!

532
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:59,147
Go, go, go, go!

533
00:28:59,147 --> 00:28:59,704
Go, go, go, go!

534
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:31,373
Lily. Lily, wait. Stop! Turn around
and listen to me right now.

535
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,470
Would somebody please,
please tell me what just happened?

536
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:36,379
-I don't know.
-I mean, it came out of nowhere!

537
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:38,075
And he was there
and then he was gone!

538
00:29:38,186 --> 00:29:40,154
-My God! Jason! Jason!
-Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

539
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,781
-My God! Jason! Jason!
-Lily, I'm so, so sorry.

540
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:45,222
Rob. You got to listen to me, man.
I am so sorry about your brother.

541
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:49,763
I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Rob?

542
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:55,264
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

543
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:00,505
-Rob. Rob, dude.
-We can't stay here.

544
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,943
-We can't.
-Rob. We got to get out of here, man.

545
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:07,242
Listen to me.
We got... We got to get moving, man.

546
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,872
We go to the Manhattan Bridge,
you know?

547
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:10,644
We got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

548
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:13,185
Okay, we can go to the other side.
We can try and get

549
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:16,415
to the Lincoln Tunnel.
I don't know, man. I don't know, but...

550
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,982
Dude, we got to get out of here.
It's not safe here.

551
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:24,222
What are we gonna do, Rob?
What are we gonna do?

552
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:27,825
Do you know? Hey!

553
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:32,095
Look... Hey, Jesus. Rob. Hey, Rob?

554
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,105
-No.
-Rob!

555
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,176
-My battery's dead.
-Yeah, dude, I...

556
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:39,075
Well, listen, we got
to get out of here, man. You know?

557
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,340
-Rob! Rob!
-Well, where's he going?

558
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:41,938
Where are you going?

559
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,677
Oh, God. I'll go get him. Hey, Rob!

560
00:30:46,254 --> 00:30:50,884
Rob! Dude!
I can't take all this running, man!

561
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:53,890
Hey, Rob.

562
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:57,390
Excuse me. Hey, Rob!
The store's closed, man!

563
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:59,728
-Rob, Rob!
-<i>... burning right now.</i>

564
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:03,801
<i>The bridge was filled</i>
<i>with pedestrians travelling across.</i>

565
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:05,133
-<i>It has collapsed.</i>
-Holy shit.

566
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,264
<i>No word on injuries yet, but...</i>

567
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,576
Oh, God.

568
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:16,609
<i>We continue now with our breaking</i>
<i>news story in lower Manhattan.</i>

569

<i>We are getting some truly extraordinary</i>
<i>live images here in the studio.</i>

570

<i>For those of you just joining us,</i>

571
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,517
<i>lower Manhattan is</i>
<i>in an absolute state of siege</i>

572
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,217
<i>in what has been...</i>

573
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,758
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation.</i>

574
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,269

<i>This is a mandatory evacuation!</i>

577
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,011
Rob? Rob! Hey, dude!

578
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,207
Actually, I think we need to get out
of here, like, right now!

579
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,477
Do you know what I'm saying?
Because there's some

580
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:53,985
serious shit going on outside!
Rob? No, like, you know what I mean?

581
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:57,023
Rob, like, there's some strange
shit going on! Rob?

582
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,553
<i>Donna Martel is near the scene</i>
<i>at City Hall.</i>

583
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,854
What's going on?

584
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,896
<i>Can you tell us what it looks like</i>
<i>on the ground there?</i>

585
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:06,228
<i>Well, Bob, the military will not</i>
<i>let us get too close,</i>

586
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:09,770
<i>but from what we can see,</i>
<i>there's clearly a sizable mobilization</i>

587
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,132
<i>of troops and equipment,</i>

588
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:13,103
<i>and they're trying to get everyone</i>
<i>to leave the area...</i>

589
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,300
<i>To be honest, Tom, your guess</i>
<i>is as good as mine at this point.</i>

590
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:17,673
<i>There appears to be</i>
<i>something coming off of it.</i>

591
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:19,939
<i>And the ground seems</i>
<i>to be covered in debris...</i>

592
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:21,674
<i>It looks like there's something</i>
<i>falling of it, doesn't it?</i>

593
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:23,511
<i>Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.</i>

594
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:25,881
<i>There are pieces falling</i>
<i>all over the street.</i>

595
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,750
-Oh, my God.
-<i>Whatever they are, they are moving.</i>

596
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:28,844
-<i>Oh, my God! They're...</i>
-<i>Donna!</i>

597
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:30,014
-<i>They're right there!</i>
-Oh, shit.

598
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:32,092
-<i>Donna, can you hear us?</i>
-Hey!

599
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:34,252
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here! Where is he?

600
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:35,351
I know, that's what I've been telling him.

601
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:36,657
-Rob! Rob!
-I've been trying to do that!

602
00:32:36,764 --> 00:32:38,527
Rob. Rob. We gotta go right now, okay?

603
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:41,362
-The military's evacuating everyone.
-Hey, Rob, listen to me, okay?

604
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:42,561
We gotta get out of here.

605
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,070
-It's time to leave the electronics store.
-Rob, come on. We got to go.

606
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,434
-Just come on. Let's go...
-Just stop it!

607
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,064
Okay? Stop, wait!

608
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:51,209
<i>To listen to your messages...</i>

609
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:59,311
<i>Rob! Rob! I can't...</i>
<i>Oh, God! I can't move.</i>

610
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:04,650
<i>It fell. My apartment...</i>
<i>The whole wall fell on me!</i>

611
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:10,029
<i>I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding. I can't move.</i>

612
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:12,125
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

613
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:17,630
<i>Help me, Rob.</i>

614
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:20,104
<i>To delete this message...</i>

615
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:35,288
Rob, wait up! Rob!

616
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:37,816
I got your message,
and I'm on my way there, okay?

617
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,393
Hey, Rob, listen.
You got to think this through, man.

618
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:43,861
Okay? Beth lives in Midtown.
Midtown is that way.

619
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:45,192
-Guess what else is that way?
-Will you wait up?

620
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,665
-Some horrific shit is in Midtown!
-This is insane, okay?

621
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:49,633
We're not gonna go
near that thing, okay?

622
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,500
We're not gonna go
to the middle of the city!

623
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:53,232
No, we're not.
You're not coming with me.

624
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,137
Look. Fall in with the military.
Fall in with the crowd.

625
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,573
Let them escort you out of here.

626
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:57,769
Okay?

627
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:00,108
-Rob!
-I'm sorry. I got to go.

628
00:34:00,214 --> 00:34:01,704
Rob!

629
00:34:01,816 --> 00:34:03,943
-Rob! Listen!
-Rob, wait a minute!

630
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:05,643
One of us is gonna have to tackle you,

631
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,278
and that's gonna be very uncomfortable
for everybody involved!

632
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,720
Listen, you can't talk me out of it, okay?

633
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:13,351
Look at me. This is not me crazy.
All right? I know what I'm doing.

634
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:14,485
And you can't talk me out of it.

635
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:17,086
-So turn around, go...
-I'm coming.

636
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:18,099
I'm coming with you.

637
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,623
I'm coming with you.

638
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:21,730
Lily, you don't have to do that.

639
00:34:21,836 --> 00:34:24,930
-No, I want to. I'm coming.
-Guys, did you not hear her message?

640
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,802
I mean, even if we get to Beth's,
there's a chance

641
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:28,738
-that she's already...
-Shut up.

642
00:34:33,747 --> 00:34:34,941
Guys, this is insane.

643
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:37,609
-Rob!
-You know what I'm talking about, right?

644
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:38,980
You can't possibly think
that this is a good idea.

645
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,178
Rob! Rob!

646
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,255
-Rob!
-Hey... Hold...

647
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:46,884
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

648
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:49,861
Yeah, but I don't understand you.
Rob, hold up!

649
00:34:50,431 --> 00:34:51,989
Look, I'm sorry. Hey, listen to me. Man.

650
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,589
-Hud!
-I'm so sorry.

651
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:55,225
Hey, Rob! Wait up, please!

652
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,304
Rob! Have you tried maybe calling 911,

653
00:34:57,404 --> 00:34:59,133
-see if somebody else can get there?
-Yeah, I tried!

654
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,572
Okay, well. I mean, what about police?
Fire department?

655
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:04,769
-I couldn't get through! I tried, I...
-Okay, it just seems a little...

656
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,205
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my God!

657
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:40,644
Oh! Oh, my God.

658
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:47,454
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

659
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:53,149
Rob! Rob! Hey, Rob!

660
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:03,993
-Hud! We're gonna go this way!
-I can't hear you!

661
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:06,868
-Subway!
-What? What?

662
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,803
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
-Come on! Come on!

663
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,174
This shit is crazy, dude!

664
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,613
Oh, Rob, dude. There's like...

665
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,456
Hud! Hud!

666
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,497
Are you okay, man? You all right?

667
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,965
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.
-Come on.

668
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:37,526
-Okay. Okay. Oh, God damn.
-Oh, shit.

669
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:46,408
What the hell was that?

670
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:52,143
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
-Did you see that?

671
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,983
-Oh, my God. Oh, God.
-Did you see that?

672
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,700
Okay.

673
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:20,741
Hey, look. We can just cross...
We can just cross to the other platform,

674
00:37:20,848 --> 00:37:22,839
then go up the stairs and see
if the other side of the street...

675
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,111
Rob, the other side of the street
looks the same as this side!

676
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:27,153
We can wait for there to be a lull,
and then make a break for it!

677
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:29,188
Rob, the air caught on fire!
Okay? There's not gonna be a lull!

678
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,552
But if we wait on the other...

679
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:33,388
Listen to me, man,
I am with you, okay? I really, really am.

680
00:37:33,494 --> 00:37:36,952
I'm just saying, you gotta listen
to what's going on up there.

681
00:37:38,332 --> 00:37:39,993
-We can't...
-Rob, he's right, okay?

682
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,500
We have to wait. We have to wait.

683
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,963
This is insane.

684
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:53,138
Shit!

685
00:38:10,898 --> 00:38:15,096
-Oh, God.
-What? Rob, what?

686
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:19,734
Hey, Mom.

687
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:24,910
Yeah, no. I'm okay. Okay, yeah, we are.

688
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:27,742
We're being evacuated right now.
The army's here.

689
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:31,944
We're being evacuated, so don't worry.
Okay, but Mom... Mom, listen.

690
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,983
We tried to get out of the city,
and we took the Brooklyn Bridge,

691
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:42,287
and we were right there when it hit.

692
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:48,023
Jason's dead. Jason's dead, Mom.

693
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,557
I don't know what to say to him.

694
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:51,362
You know?

695
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,395
Like, I feel like I should say something,

696
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:59,732
but I don't know what to say.

697
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:20,457
I'm not even supposed to be here.

698
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:25,692
You didn't have to be. I mean,

699
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:29,759
you had your chance in the alley.

700
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,133
You could've left us.

701
00:40:34,942 --> 00:40:39,345
Yeah, you were supposed to meet up
with some friends or something, right?

702
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:41,772
Yeah.

703
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,081
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:50,112
-This isn't a bad idea.
-Just walk.

705
00:40:50,224 --> 00:40:52,488
-Wait, so then...
-What's going on?

706
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:54,060
I don't know.

707
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:02,530
...just go across here.
-That's good.

708
00:41:02,636 --> 00:41:04,536
Yeah. This is the six.

709
00:41:04,638 --> 00:41:06,299
Rob, I don't think the trains
are running right now, man.

710
00:41:06,406 --> 00:41:08,465
-No, we can just walk the track, see?
-Yeah.

711
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:10,042
Look. Beth lives here, Columbus Circle.

712
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:12,805
We can just walk down the six
to Lexington and then walk down

713
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:15,915
-Central Park South.
-You want us to walk in the tunnels?

714
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,211
It's either that or stay here.

715
00:41:20,254 --> 00:41:22,154
I'll walk the tunnels.

716
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:33,526
I can't see.

717
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:36,933
-It's kind of freaking me out, you know?
-I think there's a light on the camera.

718
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,527
-Let me see.
-There is?

719
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,005
Yeah, right here. See?

720
00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:47,438
Okay.

721
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,091
Ocean is big, dude.

722
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:03,986
All I'm saying is a couple of years ago,

723
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:06,088
they found a fish in Madagascar
that they thought

724
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,190
-had been extinct for centuries.
-So what?

725
00:42:08,302 --> 00:42:10,202
It's been down there this whole time,
and nobody noticed?

726
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:13,364
Sure. Maybe it erupted
from an ocean trench, you know?

727
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:16,909
Or a crevasse. Crevice.
It's just a theory.

728
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,002
I mean, for all we know,
it's from another planet and it flew here.

729
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:22,707
-Like Superman?
-Yeah, exactly like...

730
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:24,943
Wait. You know who Superman is?

731
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:28,681
Oh, my God.
You know who Superman is?

732
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:31,383
-Okay, I'm not...
-I'm, like, feeling something.

733
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:33,459
-Are you aware of Garfield?
-A lot of people think

734
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,152
he's from a planet
that he's not actually from.

735
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,594
I just can't stop thinking about how
the last thing I said to her was,

736
00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:39,791
"Good luck tonight, Travis."

737
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,665
She knows you didn't mean that.

738
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:48,606
When I think of some of the things
I said to Jason...

739
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,870
-No, that's different.
-Why?

740
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,971
Jason knew you loved him.

741
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,927
Hey, do you guys remember
a couple of years ago, when that guy

742
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,123
was lighting homeless people
on fire in the subways?

743
00:43:12,232 --> 00:43:13,722
-Jesus, Hud.
-What?

744
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:16,598
It's maybe not the best topic
for conversation down here.

745
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:17,863
Right.

746
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:24,670
I just can't stop thinking how scary
it would be if a flaming homeless guy

747
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:25,972
-came out of the dark right now.
-Hud, seriously.

748
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,138
-Seriously.
-I'm just saying. Sorry.

749
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,821
-What was that?
-Let's just keep moving.

750
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:35,185
-What was that?
-Let's just keep moving.

751
00:43:36,023 --> 00:43:37,157
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

752
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:39,455
Holy shit! Oh, God, this is nasty.

753
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:45,524
This is disgusting.

754
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:47,463
They're all running
in the same direction.

755
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:50,400
-Yeah, like they're running away.
-From what?

756
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,009
Hey, how much farther?

757
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:01,944
I don't know.
Let's get out at the next station.

758
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:03,414
-Okay?
-Yeah.

759
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:06,547
Did you guys hear that?

760
00:44:07,487 --> 00:44:09,546
-What is that?
-Just listen.

761
00:44:11,425 --> 00:44:14,292
I don't see anything. Do you guys?

762
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:20,425
-Oh, man, this is the worst.
-Will you be quiet for five seconds?

763
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,900
-Oh, turn on the night vision.
-What?

764
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:24,300
-What do you mean?
-It's right here.

765
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:27,032
I got it. It's right here. There.

766
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,470
Is it on?

767
00:44:31,578 --> 00:44:33,944
-Oh, shit.
-What? What?

768
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:36,140
-Run. Okay, run. Okay, run.
-What?

769
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:38,774
Hey, let's start running! Just run!
Just run! Just start running right now!

770
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:43,379
Start running now! Run, run, run!
Run! Just run!

771
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,321
-Lily!
-You guys!

772
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:50,293
Wait.

773
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:57,426
Oh, God! Help!
Please help! You guys, help!

774
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,611
Marlena! Here!

775
00:45:12,886 --> 00:45:15,616
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

776
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:20,384
Hud!

777
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:31,104
...there you go.
-Totally not what I was thinking...

778
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:31,729
...there you go.
-Totally not what I was thinking...

779
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:48,677
How are you doing over there, Marlena?

780
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:50,279
You okay?

781
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,357
You tell me.

782
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,853
How does it look?

783
00:45:57,898 --> 00:45:59,627
Looks like it hurts.

784
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:03,068
What do you mean? You're saying
this isn't attractive, like, at all?

785
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,137
A little bit.

786
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:16,143
-Here. Here, here. You can wash it off.
-Thanks.

787
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:19,377
Here. Did it get you, Hud?
Did it bite you, man?

788
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,181
No, it didn't get me.

789
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:23,586
Okay. Okay.

790
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:29,422
Hey. Hey.

791
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:32,088
So those things
came out of nowhere, right?

792
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:34,133
-Yeah.
-Oh, man.

793
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:38,665
That one that grabbed me,
it was trying to drag me away.

794
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:40,239
What's up with that?

795
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:45,540
-Maybe it liked you, Hud.
-Yeah.

796
00:46:46,112 --> 00:46:48,808
Maybe it was trying
to make me its queen.

797
00:46:52,986 --> 00:46:58,788
Hey, thanks for coming back
and helping me out, you know?

798
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:03,728
What? You think that I'm the kind
of person that wouldn't do that?

799
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:07,357
No. No. I know you aren't.

800
00:47:08,602 --> 00:47:12,663
I was just saying, like, I'm glad you did.

801
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:19,807
Otherwise,
I would have been totally dead.

802
00:47:20,814 --> 00:47:21,940
Right?

803
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,676
It's okay. You just got bit.

804
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:27,008
Hey.

805
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,480
Marlena's hurt pretty bad, you know?

806
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,926
Well, we could wait here
for a little bit, I guess,

807
00:47:34,027 --> 00:47:36,086
and just hope those things
don't make it through the door.

808
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:38,096
-Yeah, okay. What's the next option?
-Well.

809
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:40,928
Okay, we could see
what's out through this way.

810
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:44,060
-Maybe find another tunnel.
-No, no more tunnels.

811
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:48,133
Then, I don't know.
We try our luck up top.

812
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:52,803
Okay, just to be clear,
so our options are

813
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:57,475
die here, die in the tunnels,
or die in the streets. Is that...

814
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,779
-Yeah, pretty much.
...pretty much the summing up of it?

815
00:47:59,886 --> 00:48:01,319
But wait, we don't even know
where we are, right?

816
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:05,619
So, let's just go up and look around.
See if we recognize anything.

817
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:09,123
Do you think you'll be okay to walk?

818
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:10,662
-No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Here, I'll help you.

819
00:48:33,553 --> 00:48:34,679
-We're at 59th.
-We're at 59th.

820
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:36,517
-Yeah.
-We're at 59th.

821
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:51,002
That's weird.

822
00:48:53,006 --> 00:48:54,064
What?

823
00:48:59,212 --> 00:49:00,270
Yeah.

824
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:15,728
Hello!

825
00:49:33,246 --> 00:49:34,577
Marlena?

826
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:37,041
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

827
00:49:38,818 --> 00:49:40,251
I'm really... I'm dizzy.

828
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:43,083
Yeah. Do you wanna
sit down for a second?

829
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:48,290
-No, I'm fine.
-She needs a doctor.

830
00:49:48,395 --> 00:49:49,487
-You sure?
-I'm totally fine.

831
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:50,995
You know, 'cause we could
sit down if you want to.

832
00:49:51,097 --> 00:49:52,064
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

833
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:54,690
We've got civilians!
Are there any more of you?

834
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:56,098
-No, just us four.
-It's just us.

835
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,692
We got four civilians here.

836
00:49:58,304 --> 00:50:00,169
-<i>Okay, bring them in.</i>
-Roger.

837
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:02,468
-Let's go, move. Move it.
-Okay, okay.

838
00:50:04,411 --> 00:50:06,811
-Let's go!
-Okay, okay.

839
00:50:09,516 --> 00:50:12,610
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Excuse me.

840
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,244
Listen, we need your help.
Our friend, she's hurt. She's trapped

841
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:16,879
in her building right by here,
at Columbus Circle.

842
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,355
That is not
where you wanna be right now.

843
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:20,060
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

844
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,856
Do you guys know what it is? Out there?
Do you know what that thing is?

845
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,327
If they know, they ain't telling me.
Whatever it is, it's winning.

846
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:35,264
-What's up?
-We got another bite here.

847
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:38,136
Don't look at that. Gross.

848
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,908
-Please, we can't stay here. We have...
-Hey, not now.

849
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:44,449
-Copy that.
-Sir, we have two F-18s

850
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:46,143
on route from Selfridge.
Four more are arming up,

851
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,743
-maybe 30 minutes out.
-Roger that.

852
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:51,790
Listen up, people.
Rack them and pack them.

853
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:54,052
-We're phantoms in 15.
-Sir.

854
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,025
-Where the hell did you find them?
-They were in the tunnels.

855
00:50:56,129 --> 00:50:58,154
Yeah, we had to walk all the way
from Spring Street.

856
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,596
Get them ready for transport,
put them on the evac chopper.

857
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,691
-Yes, sir. Let's move. Move, move.
-No, wait. Wait.

858
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:04,064
-Listen, our friend is very badly hurt.
-Move it.

859
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,159
-Move. Move.
-We have to get to her.

860
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,568
Sorry, son, can't help you.
Get them on the chopper.

861
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:09,141
No, but, please, listen to me. Let go!
Just listen for a second, please!

862
00:51:09,742 --> 00:51:10,868
Turn that goddamned camera...

863
00:51:12,879 --> 00:51:15,313
-We've been trying to get to her all...
-Make our own way.

864
00:51:15,415 --> 00:51:17,975
-No, do you have a...
-I am not jeopardizing this operation,

865
00:51:18,084 --> 00:51:19,415
-or my men.
-I don't want your help.

866
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:20,952
You are getting on that chopper now.

867
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:22,385
I just need you to listen to me
for one second, sir.

868
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:24,616
-You have no idea what's out there.
-I don't care what's out there.

869
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:25,691
Listen to me. She's dying.

870
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:26,952
There is nothing I can do
about that now.

871
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,460
The girl that I love more than anything
is dying and it's my fault.

872
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:32,224
She should have been with me tonight,
and I let her go and...

873
00:51:32,332 --> 00:51:34,300
And I get it, okay?
You have your hands full. I get that.

874
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,267
I get that, but we're gonna go after her,
and if you wanna stop me,

875
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,702
-then you're gonna have to shoot me.
-Hud.

876
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,304
-I don't feel so good.
-Oh, shit.

877
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:46,344
-Bite! We've got a bite!
-Marlena.

878
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:47,606
-Hold on a second.
-Get her moving.

879
00:51:47,714 --> 00:51:48,772
Keep moving!

880
00:51:48,882 --> 00:51:50,975
Hey, Marlena, are you okay?
Hey, what are you guys doing?

881
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:52,984
Hold on a second.
Where are you taking her?

882
00:51:53,086 --> 00:51:54,815
Hold on a second. Wait!
Oh my God, wait!

883
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:56,946
-Marlena, stop! Just wait a second!
-Let me go.

884
00:51:57,056 --> 00:51:58,318
-Just wait a second. Please.
-Let me go.

885
00:51:58,424 --> 00:51:59,914
-Wait! Marlena!
-Get out of the way.

886
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:01,755
Marlena! Hold on a second!

887
00:52:01,861 --> 00:52:04,159
-Just wait a... Let go of me! Stop it!
-No.

888
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:11,393
God! Please, God!
Where are you taking Marlena?

889
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:12,732
Wait a second.

890
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:22,237
It's over. There is nothing you can do.

891
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:26,444
There is nothing you can do
for her now. It is over. It's over.

892
00:52:27,954 --> 00:52:30,047
-Rogers, clear out of here.
-You sure?

893
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:32,181
I'll get them to the choppers from here.

894
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:34,817
-Let's move out.
-Oh, my God.

895
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:37,729
What just happened?

896
00:52:39,766 --> 00:52:42,132
Let's go. I shouldn't be doing this shit.

897
00:52:42,235 --> 00:52:45,329
-Come on. Come on.
-Okay.

898
00:52:45,438 --> 00:52:47,463
-Let's go. Move.
-Okay, okay.

899
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:48,973
Let's go, move. Come on.

900
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:55,042
You gotta listen to me.

901
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:58,344
This girl, her building,
it's at Columbus Circle?

902
00:52:58,451 --> 00:53:01,249
-Yeah?
-lf you wanna go out in this,

903
00:53:01,354 --> 00:53:03,618
I ain't gonna stop you.
But you gotta know something.

904
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:06,055
The government's considering
the Hammer Down protocol,

905
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,990
which means they're willing
to let this whole area go.

906
00:53:08,094 --> 00:53:10,722
-You mean Midtown?
-No, I mean Manhattan.

907
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,799
Come on. We're taking
one last shot at this thing.

908
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,867
-Oh, God.
-lf that doesn't work,

909
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:17,664
they're leveling
the whole goddamned city.

910
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:20,038
-Your watch is still working?
-Yeah?

911
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:22,733
All right. The airlifts are leaving
from 40th and Park.

912
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:25,504
Last chopper's wheels-up
at exactly 0600.

913
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:28,413
If you can make it there,
then they'll get you out.

914
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:31,210
-Okay. Okay, thank you.
-58th Street's right there.

915
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:33,080
-Now, go. Move, move, move.
-Let's go.

916
00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:34,346
-Let's go.
-Go, go, go.

917
00:53:37,457 --> 00:53:39,755
-This is like a nightmare, you know.
-It all happened so fast,

918
00:53:39,859 --> 00:53:41,759
I couldn't even really see
what happened to her.

919
00:53:42,395 --> 00:53:44,829
I mean, did you see it?
Could you see what happened, Hud?

920
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:47,764
No, her eyes started bleeding, and then
they were screaming she was bitten.

921
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:50,165
And then she wouldn't stop bleeding.
And then...

922
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,770
Hud.

923
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:01,342
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

924
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:07,915
Look, guys, I don't mean to be...
But we don't have a lot of time.

925
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:11,013
Okay, so maybe you guys
should just stay here, and I'll go.

926
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,421
All right?

927
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:17,120
-I'm sorry. I just...
-No, no, we're coming. We're coming.

928
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,356
Are you sure?

929
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,024
No, no, man.
No, we have to do this, okay?

930
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,602
We're with you. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go right now.

931
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:39,408
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-What?

932
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:41,953
-Oh, my God.
-What is it? What?

933
00:54:43,022 --> 00:54:45,820
-Shit.
-That's not Beth's place, is it?

934
00:54:45,925 --> 00:54:47,859
-Oh, my God.
-Is that Beth's apartment?

935
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,361
-Oh, my God.
-Rob. Is that her place?

936
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:54,660
-Tell me that's not her place.
-That's her place, yeah.

937
00:54:56,035 --> 00:54:59,732
Oh, shit. I don't suppose
she lives on the ground floor.

938
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,999
No, 39th.

939
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:02,802
-Oh, great.
-How do we even get up there?

940
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:06,868
I don't know. We just go inside
and then see how high we can get.

941
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:10,774
I don't know if I can do that.

942
00:55:10,883 --> 00:55:13,875
Well, maybe we could try going up
the other building,

943
00:55:13,986 --> 00:55:16,716
and then see if there's a place
to cross over onto her roof.

944
00:55:16,823 --> 00:55:19,986
And then we could find some way
down to her place.

945
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:23,527
Wait. No, never mind.
No, that's a bad idea.

946
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:25,064
Hey, that's a bad idea. I take that back.

947
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:30,794
No one ever listens to me, ever.
And now, of course, they listen to me.

948
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:31,892
Great.

949
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:36,471
Shit. Shit.

950
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,709
Probably not working.

951
00:55:38,811 --> 00:55:40,176
-What's going on?
-Not working.

952
00:55:40,279 --> 00:55:42,577
Wait, wait. Let's just... Maybe...

953
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,641
-No? No?
-Shit.

954
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:48,312
Well, why don't you take the stairs?

955
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:53,682
You guys see that guy's face
when Lily asked him what it was?

956
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:55,886
I mean, they have no idea.

957
00:55:57,797 --> 00:56:01,858
-Unless they're, like, in on it.
-Jesus, Hud.

958
00:56:01,968 --> 00:56:03,299
I don't read the papers.

959
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:05,064
-Maybe our government made this thing.
-Oh, yeah.

960
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:06,832
I mean, you know,
maybe it was an accident,

961
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,270
-or maybe it was on purpose...
-Sure, maybe they did.

962
00:56:08,374 --> 00:56:10,205
-Does it really matter right now?
-Yeah.

963
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:14,142
It matters because I need to talk
about something.

964
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:17,948
Otherwise, I'm actually probably
going to shit my pants in this stairwell.

965
00:56:22,822 --> 00:56:23,789
I'm sorry.

966
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:29,022
Hey, wait, wait. You guys hear that?
You guys hear that?

967
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:31,819
-Yes.
-Yeah.

968
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,331
Yeah, I think we're getting close.

969
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:37,762
Hud, I'm gonna check this floor.

970
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:38,837
Okay.

971
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:49,047
Okay, like, I think it's like,
two more up, I think.

972
00:56:49,148 --> 00:56:50,115
Okay.

973
00:56:51,384 --> 00:56:52,612
Guys, guys, guys.

974
00:56:53,419 --> 00:56:55,853
This one, it's got to be.
It's got to be this one.

975
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:12,960
Oh, God.

976
00:57:18,945 --> 00:57:22,472
I don't think there's anybody here. No.

977
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,378
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh, my God.

978
00:57:30,256 --> 00:57:32,816
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

979
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:34,886
Okay, now, we can do this.
We can totally do this.

980
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:36,484
-I don't know, Rob.
-Look, it's a straight shot.

981
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:38,894
-I don't know. I'm sorry.
-Lily, Lily, it's a straight shot.

982
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,159
Look, it's a straight shot.
We could use... There's pipes there.

983
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:44,361
We could use
the air conditioners. Okay?

984
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:46,967
Come on. We came this far.
We can do it. I'll go first.

985
00:57:47,073 --> 00:57:48,040
-Okay, okay, okay. Yes.
-All right? Okay.

986
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,099
-Okay, I'll document it.
-Be careful, okay?

987
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:56,272
-Come on. Come on.
-Okay. Okay.

988
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:03,214
Okay. Hud, come on!
Put the camera down! Come on!

989
00:58:03,322 --> 00:58:04,789
Oh, Jesus.

990
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:07,223
-Okay. All right. Okay.
-I'll go first.

991
00:58:07,326 --> 00:58:11,922
All right. If this is the last thing you see,
that means I died.

992
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:13,521
-Hud, come on!
-Okay.

993
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,047
Look out! Oh, shit...

994
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:30,516
Okay.

995
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:35,214
-Okay. Okay.
-Shit.

996
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:42,184
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, God.

997
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:57,138
-Yes. Okay. You all right?
-Yeah.

998
00:58:57,243 --> 00:58:59,302
We're almost there, come on.

999
00:59:01,814 --> 00:59:03,213
Come on, Hud.

1000
00:59:06,986 --> 00:59:07,975
Shit.

1001
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:13,317
Beth! Beth! Beth!

1002
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:26,800
-Can you get it?
-Do you need help?

1003
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,798
Do you need help? Or...

1004
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:38,076
Beth? Beth?

1005
00:59:41,654 --> 00:59:42,678
Beth?

1006
00:59:45,191 --> 00:59:48,285
Beth? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1007
00:59:48,394 --> 00:59:49,827
-What?
-Shit.

1008
00:59:50,396 --> 00:59:54,093
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Beth.

1009
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,501
-Beth.
-What?

1010
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:00,663
Beth!

1011
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:03,809
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1012
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:14,686
Can you hear me? Beth.

1013
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:33,437
Hey.

1014
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:40,012
-Are you really here?
-Yeah, I'm really here.

1015
01:00:41,914 --> 01:00:42,903
Rob?

1016
01:00:44,717 --> 01:00:46,810
You came back for me.

1017
01:00:47,787 --> 01:00:49,982
Of course I came back for you.

1018
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:56,089
-I'm sorry it took me so long.
-No, it's okay.

1019
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:02,657
Okay, okay, okay. You're okay.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

1020
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:05,328
We'll get you out, all right?
Hud, put the camera down

1021
01:01:05,438 --> 01:01:07,201
-and help me, okay?
-Okay, okay.

1022
01:01:08,607 --> 01:01:09,699
-It'll be okay.
-Okay, here we go.

1023
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:12,175
-lf we all just lift at the same time.
-Hold on, okay. We got you.

1024
01:01:12,278 --> 01:01:14,007
-All right? We have to.
-Don't do that, Rob.

1025
01:01:14,113 --> 01:01:15,740
-Please don't do that.
-It's gonna be over in a second.

1026
01:01:15,848 --> 01:01:16,906
-All right?
-Okay. Ready, guys?

1027
01:01:17,016 --> 01:01:18,210
-No, please. No.
-Slowly. It's okay.

1028
01:01:18,317 --> 01:01:19,682
We're gonna do it real slow.

1029
01:01:19,785 --> 01:01:21,446
-Easy, easy, just wait.
-No, don't.

1030
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:23,886
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1031
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,891
Oh, God.

1032
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:35,733
-Okay, now, sit down. Sit down.
-I know. I know. Here.

1033
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:38,770
I know. I know. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1034
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:43,169
-You're gonna be fine.
-No, no, no.

1035
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:45,766
I know, I know, I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.

1036
01:01:48,814 --> 01:01:50,645
What is that?

1037
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:52,747
-God.
-It's a terrible thing.

1038
01:01:52,852 --> 01:01:54,615
-Okay. We gotta go. We gotta go.
-Okay. Let's go.

1039
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,051
-I got you.
-Oh, God.

1040
01:01:56,155 --> 01:01:59,318
-Oh, God.
-All right. All right. Go, go, go.

1041
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:01,586
-Go.
-Okay. I got you.

1042
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:03,958
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

1043
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:06,293
Just hold on to me.
You're gonna be all right.

1044
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,034
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

1045
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,173
-Okay. Hang on to me.
-Oh, my God.

1046
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,676
-Okay, okay.
-Oh, my God.

1047
01:02:21,547 --> 01:02:22,639
Okay.

1048
01:02:23,182 --> 01:02:26,413
Oh, shit. Man, this is unbelievable.

1049
01:02:28,387 --> 01:02:31,254
-Are you okay?
-Just don't look down, okay?

1050
01:02:31,357 --> 01:02:33,518
-I can't help it.
-You're all right. You're all right.

1051
01:02:33,626 --> 01:02:34,854
Oh, my God.

1052
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:39,958
Oh, God!

1053
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:42,493
-Okay, let's go.
-Keep moving, just go.

1054
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:44,694
Go, just go. Just go, go, go. Go.
Just get to the other side.

1055
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,829
Come on, just keep moving.

1056
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:50,142
Oh, my God.

1057
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:54,770
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, my God!

1058
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,371
-Oh, my God. Did you see that?
-Okay, come on.

1059
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,610
-Get inside.
-Okay. Come on, come on.

1060
01:02:59,718 --> 01:03:01,652
-Oh, God.
-Go! Go!

1061
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,191
Run! Run! Hurry!

1062
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:16,396
-Rob, come on!
-Oh, my God.

1063
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:32,281
Oh, my God.

1064
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:35,278
-What the hell was that?
-I don't know.

1065
01:03:35,387 --> 01:03:37,651
Something else also terrible.

1066
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:39,881
Rob, what time
do the choppers take off?

1067
01:03:39,992 --> 01:03:41,823
-0600.
-What time is that?

1068
01:03:41,927 --> 01:03:44,487
-6:00, Hud.
-Yeah, okay. I knew that.

1069
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,059
-Come on, come on.
-Okay.

1070
01:04:26,939 --> 01:04:27,906
Wait up!

1071
01:04:35,514 --> 01:04:37,880
-Did we make it?
-We want to get out of here, come on.

1072
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:40,479
Let's go! Let's go!

1073
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,752
Keep your heads down.

1074
01:04:43,856 --> 01:04:45,483
Come on! Come on!

1075
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:49,986
You guys are on the next chopper.

1076
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,892
-No!
-Clear this area. Clear this area.

1077
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:54,795
-No, no, wait. Wait.
-Lily!

1078
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:58,365
We'll be right behind you, okay?

1079
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,372
Wait for us. Wait for us.
We'll be right behind you.

1080
01:05:05,644 --> 01:05:09,136
We're gonna be okay. All right?
We're gonna be all right, you hear me?

1081
01:05:17,056 --> 01:05:21,220
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

1082
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:31,362
Stay low. Stay low.
Come on, come on, come on.

1083
01:05:32,204 --> 01:05:33,171
Thank you.

1084
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,869
-They're starting the bomb run.
-Get them out of here. Get going.

1085
01:05:49,054 --> 01:05:51,079
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

1086
01:05:53,525 --> 01:05:56,153
Oh, my God.
Are you guys seeing this right now?

1087
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:58,354
Are you seeing this right now?
Look, look, look.

1088
01:05:58,464 --> 01:06:04,027
Are you seeing this shit right now?
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1089
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:12,708
Oh, God.
Those aren't gonna hit us, are they?

1090
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,607
Oh, my God. They hit it!
They just hit it right now!

1091
01:06:16,715 --> 01:06:20,207
Look, you guys, they just hit it!
They hit it with... Oh, my God!

1092
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,816
-Yeah, they hit it, you guys! They hit it!
-Oh, he's going down.

1093
01:06:24,323 --> 01:06:27,019
<i>Target down. Target down.</i>
<i>Target down. He's down.</i>

1094
01:06:27,126 --> 01:06:28,923
I think they got him.

1095
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:31,496
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's the shit right there!

1096
01:06:31,597 --> 01:06:35,431
That's what I'm talking about...
Oh, my God! Oh, no, no, no!

1097
01:06:38,237 --> 01:06:40,762
Oh, my God. Oh my God.
God, please, God.

1098
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:43,933
Please, God. Please.
Please, God and Jesus.

1099
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:45,670
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

1100
01:06:45,778 --> 01:06:48,303
I'm so sorry, God. Please, no.

1101
01:06:48,414 --> 01:06:50,279
Help me, Rob!

1102
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:53,749
Rob. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

Hud, are you okay?

Hud, come over to the other side.

1114

You've got to pull him up.
Come on, come on.

-I don't think I can move.

-My leg!
-I know. I know, I know. I know.

1122
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:22,003
It's okay, you're fine. You're good.
You're okay. You're okay.

1123
01:08:22,107 --> 01:08:23,506
I'm gonna have to stop the bleeding,
okay? Okay?

1124
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:24,940
I'm not okay.
I'm not gonna be able to walk.

1125
01:08:25,043 --> 01:08:27,477
You are going to be able to walk.

1126
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:31,980
Don't do it.

1127
01:08:33,785 --> 01:08:35,650
Okay. All right, listen,
we got to get out of here, okay?

1128
01:08:35,754 --> 01:08:36,880
Well, which way do we go?

1129
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:39,116
We have to get away from here,
because I think it's gonna explode.

01:08:39,224 --> 01:08:42,057
-Okay, okay. Okay.
-All right? Come on. Let's go.

01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:44,629
Let's go this way. Come on.
Come on, you can walk. Okay.

1132

01:08:53,805 --> 01:08:55,295
-Hud! Hud!
-Hud, what are you doing?

01:09:04,616 --> 01:09:05,640

Hud!

1144
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:24,894
He's gone.

1145
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,133
He's gone.

1146
01:10:31,036 --> 01:10:33,368
-They're all gone.
-I know.

1147
01:10:39,044 --> 01:10:43,913
We gotta go. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

1148
01:10:44,016 --> 01:10:47,076
Where? There's nowhere to go to.

1149
01:10:47,185 --> 01:10:49,415
We got to go. He's coming towards us.

1150
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:52,547
No, we should just wait here.
Just wait here.

1151
01:10:52,658 --> 01:10:55,354
Listen, we wait here,
they'll find us, all right?

1152
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,122
They're fighting him right now.
If we wait here, they'll find us.

1153
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:00,323
No, we can't stay.

1154
01:11:04,036 --> 01:11:05,731
It's okay. It's okay.

1155
01:11:09,274 --> 01:11:12,971
-I'm so scared.
-I know. I know. I know.

1156
01:11:40,806 --> 01:11:42,967
My name is Robert Hawkins.

1157
01:11:43,075 --> 01:11:47,842
It's 6:42 a.m. on Saturday, May 23.

1158
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:52,483
Approximately seven hours ago,
something attacked the city.

1159
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,917
I don't know what it is.

1160
01:11:55,754 --> 01:11:58,245
If you found this tape... I mean,
if you're watching this right now,

1161
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:01,190
then you probably know more
about it than I do.

1162
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:07,093
Whatever it is,
it killed my brother, Jason Hawkins.

1163
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,259
It killed my best friend, Hudson Platt,
and Marlena Diamond,

1164
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:12,166
and many, many others.

1165
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,706
We've crashed here in Central Park
and taken shelter under this bridge.

1166
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:18,139
The military has begun
bombing the creature

1167
01:12:18,243 --> 01:12:20,302
and we're caught in the middle.

1168
01:12:21,813 --> 01:12:23,303
Okay. Ready?

1169
01:12:27,919 --> 01:12:29,318
It's okay.

1170
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:34,356
-Beth, look at me.
-I don't know what to say.

1171
01:12:34,459 --> 01:12:36,950
Well, just tell them who you are.

1172
01:12:39,297 --> 01:12:44,792
My name is Elizabeth McIntyre.
I don't know why this is happening.

1173
01:12:48,106 --> 01:12:50,506
But we're gonna wait here
until this passes.

1174
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:55,972
Rob, we're gonna wait here.

1175
01:13:05,056 --> 01:13:07,456
Look at me, Beth.
Look at me. Look at me.

1176
01:13:07,559 --> 01:13:09,891
-I love you.
-I love you.

1177
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:17,263
I know what I'm talking about.
Come on, admit it.

1178
01:13:17,369 --> 01:13:19,030
You are going to miss me
a little bit, right?

1179
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:21,571
Yeah, we'll see.

1180
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:23,472
Okay, yeah, all right.

1181
01:13:23,575 --> 01:13:25,941
All right, we're almost out of tape.
We got, like, three seconds left.

1182
01:13:26,044 --> 01:13:27,170
What do you wanna say?
What do you wanna say?

1183
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:28,405
Last thing to the camera.

1184
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:31,478
I had a good day.
