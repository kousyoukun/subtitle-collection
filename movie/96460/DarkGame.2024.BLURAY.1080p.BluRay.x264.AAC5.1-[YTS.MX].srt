and welcome to Russian Roulette.

You'll remember Ms. Green here,
real name Fay.

00:01:09,217 --> 00:01:13,065

Congratulations.

Your wager of 124K
is our highest correct guess.

in an operation led by detectives
Benjamin Jacobs and Cathy Burnett.

and reports
have yet to be substantiated.

But we believe both of
the children were found alive.

And we understand they have
been reunited with their parents

Could be anywhere.

just poop yourself?

it was yesterday too.

185
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:02,546
from the feed itself

186
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:06,708
are in the region of one
in 7 trillion.

187
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:10,921
So we can't identify
who's running the show.

188
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:13,171
We can't find out
who's watching it either.

189
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,509
-So he's got us.
-For now.

190
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:17,879
We're doing everything we can,
detectives,

191
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:20,296
including echo-bouncing
the messages they sent out.

192
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:21,424
They sent out messages?

193
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,816
On the dark web, yeah.

194
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:24,784
How else
will they find an audience?

195
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,601
By now,
their computers may well know

196
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,588
we've got ours trying
to crack their code.

197
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:30,659
They won't know it's us.

198
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:34,004
We're just one of the many systems out
there policing the waves, uh,

199
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:36,569
but their computers
are constantly changing the code

200
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:38,629
before anyone works out
how to break it.

201
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:40,713
Basically, it's a race.

202
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,508
A race we win.

203
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,536
Most times, yeah.

204
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:49,218
Uh, really good to meet you,
Detective Jacobs.

205
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,266
Your stories, something else.

206
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:54,088
Win the race, Green.

[thrilling music playing]

208
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:16,728
As we know, Fay disappeared two weeks
ago after taking a walk.

209
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,038
No cameras in the park.

210
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,481
This was the last image of her.

211
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,104
And the other guy?

212
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:22,263
Guy one?

They've got the results show.

The first round
of Russian Roulette

217
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,199
comes to an end,
ladies and gentlemen.

Not in this case with a bang,

00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:36,421
but with a [roaring].

Oh, she was a bleeder.

226
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,754
And the fun
doesn't stop there, folks.

227
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,729

This went out last night?

231
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,699
Seven, our time.

232
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,922
Look, I don't wanna be
that guy, but...

233
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,964
is this real?

234
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:24,667
Is this some
fucking deep fake shit...

235
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:26,922
or is it real?

236
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:28,880
There's ways we can check.

237
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,545
Um, pixel of lineman,
lighting anomalies.

238
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,922

"Brand new contestant."

That's what he said.

243
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:54,452
Someone he's got,
someone he's gonna get.

We're just gonna let him
take someone off the street.

We do what we can, Ben.

247
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:03,042

in the meantime?

Very good, Lev.

250
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:19,339
Doesn't Mama look professional?

251
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,172
She looks funny.

252
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:24,514
Funny?

253
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:26,572
[chuckles] Well,

254
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,722
I guess
you've never seen your mom

255
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:29,949
looking like this before.

256
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,714
But the thing is,
I've forgotten to.

257
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:39,672
This is your first step back
into the job market.

258
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,505
Remember this.

259
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,172
You can do this, Katia.

260
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:49,630
You can do anything.

261
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,755
You left that abusive piece of--

262
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:57,042
you left that piece of work

263
00:12:57,454 --> 00:13:00,020
and you brought your son
all the way over here

264
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,175
for a better life.

265
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,089
That's the woman you are.

266
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,630
Don't forget it.

267
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,020
Okay, mom.

268
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:18,739
Be good to your grandma,
okay, Lev?

269
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,022
-Okay?
-[whispers] Okay.

-Good luck.
-Thanks.

That's what matters most,
what you're doing right there.

Nice big smile.

278
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,964
Oh, if it's that easy,
I'm gonna nail it.

I'm Katia.

Jane says you've worked
in this kind of retail before.

282
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,381
Yes, I did.

283
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:05,816
In Moscow a few years ago now.

284
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:08,047
-Then you've got this.
-I hope so.

We adjusted brightness,
screen color, gradient,

four others, plus Sam,
the rock-paper-scissors guy.

293
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:45,826
Is it good enough
for a match or what?

294
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:46,861
Two so far.

295
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,196
They're all wearing
color-coded armbands.

296
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,084
Sam Clark, Mr. Yellow.

297
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:53,997
The rock-paper-scissor guy
went missing six nights ago

298
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,346
after leaving
a downtown nightclub.

299
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:56,924
Witnesses say he was drunk.

300
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,337
Friends say he's teetotal.

301

six months ago.

303

between temporary addresses

307
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,681
so he could have been abducted
at any time.

308
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:13,381
This is not a deep fake, Ben.
This is real.

309
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,286
We're doing acoustic analysis
of the audio.

310
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,867
It can tell us
the size of the room,

311
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,824
maybe even the layout, and, uh,

312
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,917
background noises
can give some suggestion

313
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,052
to the site's location, um...

314
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,464
about hacking the feed though,

315
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,091
I-- I--
I wanted to suggest something.

316
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:29,739
-What?
-Um, well, someone.

317
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,377
If there's one person
who stands a chance

318
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:33,797
of breaking this IP wide open...

319
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:37,464
-its [indistinct] Larch.
-Are you out of your mind?

320
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:38,922
Which is why
I decided not to bullshit,

321
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,357
detective,
and say it like it is.

322
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:41,922
I studied Larch's case
for my major.

323
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,302
The guy's in a league
of his own.

324
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,596
And you're the one
who got him, so.

325
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:46,781
His lawyers reached out to us
last year on the Bowler case,

326
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:49,791
-offering his help.
-He offers his help every year.

327
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,407
Well, maybe this time
you should say yes.

328
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:52,856
So you're admitting
you're not up to it.

329
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:54,477
I'm admitting--

330
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,441
-What?
-We need a specialist.

332
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:10,896
So, how was it?

333
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:13,172
Good. I think.

334
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:14,276
I hope.

335
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:16,356
Sofia was such a great help.

336
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,131
Well, I liked what I saw.

337
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,082
Well done.

338
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:24,227
See you tomorrow.

339
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,047
See you tomorrow.

340
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,944
Someone deserves a drink.

A tradition
at the end of your first day

342
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:34,286
to celebrate
joining our happy little family.

343
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,089
I probably shouldn't.

344
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:40,476
Wouldn't want to break
a tradition on your first day.

345
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:44,339
Okay, why not? [chuckles]

00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,689
[Sofia] Didn't make an American
degenerate out of you yet?

348
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,516
America, yes.

349
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:17,225
But degenerate, no, not so much.
[laughs]

350
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,741
-The American dream.
-Now you're talking.

351
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,309
We have to drink to that.

Do you have a husband?

No, not anymore luckily.

But I have my true love.

This is Lev, my little kotik.

Kotik, what's that? Oh!

00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,234
That's what I call my son.

361
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,256
Lev means lion.

362
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,442
Kotik means little cat.

00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:49,239
Sweet. And who's with him now?

364
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:52,344
-My mom.
-Ah, she moved here as well.

365
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,589
Yeah, that's what
family's all about, right?

366
00:17:56,081 --> 00:17:58,292
Yes.
We have to drink to that too.

00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,988
Help!

381
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,615
Help!

382
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,882
[Katia whimpering]

383
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,067

389
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:47,908
[Sasha] Hey.

390
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,590
Hey.

391
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,215
I know you're scared...

392
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:54,928
but try not to make a sound.

393
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,340
Don't move.

394
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:58,800
We're not allowed to talk.

395
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,757
We think
the cameras are above us...

396
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:06,715
so we can communicate a little
if we lie like this.

397
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:09,172
No movement. Just whispers.

398
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,972
My name is Sasha.

399
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:14,727
Katia.

400
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:16,673
Where are we?

401
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,882
We don't know.

402
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:21,632
What do they want?

403
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:24,415
[metal creaking]

404
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:28,615
[Sasha] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

405
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
It's okay, Katia.

406
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:33,565
You can do this.

407
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,654
They're going to be watching now
as you've just come in,

408
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:38,806
so we need to lay low
for a while.

409
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:42,038
But Katia, keep your mind clear.

410
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,738
Keep strong.

411
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:45,511
We're going to need
everyone's strength

412
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:46,714
to get out of here.

413
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,804
Because that's what
we're gonna do.

414
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:50,649
Understand?

415
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,881

[Katia grunting]

419
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:19,413
Did you think for a second
she might get away,

420
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:20,689
ladies and gentlemen?

421
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,229
Just playing with you.

422
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,464
Don't forget to tune in
tomorrow

423
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,763
to meet
our wonderful new contestant,

424
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:30,776
the second Ms. Green.

425
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,626
All road signs and identifying
markers have been blurred,

426
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:35,653
but we have enough
other information to go on.

427
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,291
Looks like here.

428
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,294
Looks like Portland.

429
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,391
On our fucking watch.

430
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:45,006
[mysterious music playing]

431
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:47,491
Is he all good

432
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:49,056
or is this one getting to him?

433
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,574
This is what he does, okay?

434
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:52,639
He finds missing people.

435
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:54,496
We all know what happened.

436
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:08,024
Thinking about
what Parker suggested?

437
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,581
No.

438
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:11,808
We need Larch.

439
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:17,756
[indistinct shouting]

440
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,048
[door buzzes]

441
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,223
How are you, detective?

442
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,211
The dark web.

443
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:55,548
Hm.

444
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,673
Rinsed and shredded, no doubt.

445
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:00,173
But there's always a way.

446
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:01,464
You would know.

447
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,381
[chuckles] Oh gosh.

448
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:05,873
The market changes rapidly, Ben.

449
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,551
Haven't been here three years. What I know
is prehistoric by now.

450
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:10,806
So I'm wasting my time.

451
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,506
He's going live
with some of these?

452
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:17,131
[suspenseful music playing]

453
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:20,739
Yeah.

454
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:22,191
Within the closed network?

455
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,619
-I think so.
-No social media?

456
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,283
Nothing we can see.

457
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:32,226
As much protection
as he gives himself,

458
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:35,151
going live in any way,
that's the weak link.

459
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:37,919
Proxies have to engage
at some point.

460
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:41,321
Think of it
like a secret ducting pipe

461
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,339
that eventually
has to meet the outside wall.

462
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:47,073
They join there, one vulnerable screw, one
nut, one spigot,

463
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:48,421
that's where you're looking for.

464
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:51,494
Who you got?

465
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:53,391
Cybercrimes?

466
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,378
Well, good luck with that.

467
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:03,589
Will you let me watch
one of the feeds?

468
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:05,673
-No.
-Aw.

469
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,524
I could help so much more
if you let me watch

470
00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:08,839
-one of the feeds.
-No.

471
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,898
All those nuances
that otherwise--

472
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:12,138
Read my lips.

473
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:15,911
Describe it to me then.

474
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:17,314
You got pictures.

475
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:19,423
Oh, a few pictures
is not the whole picture.

476
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:21,673
Come on,
talk me through it, Ben.

477
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,271
He made them play
rock-paper-scissors.

478
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:28,954
If they didn't cooperate,

479
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,933
they were electrocuted
with a cattle prod.

00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:32,626
[gasps]

481
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:35,839
The loser was assassinated
in a live show later on.

482
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:37,204
Assassinated how?

483
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,506
-Chainsaw.
-[gasps]

484
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:42,699
The viewer
had a choice of three weapons.

485
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:44,548
-What were the other two?
-Why do you wanna know?

486
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:45,726
Full picture, Ben.

487
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,757
Baseball bat
and a lethal injection.

488
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,924
Wipe that fucking smile
off your face.

489
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:56,954
My hands are tied.

490
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:58,949
What else
am I gonna do for pleasure?

491
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:00,924
Look, I did what I did

492
00:26:00,965 --> 00:26:02,827
on my dark web network
for my entertainment.

493
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:05,799
This guy, well, he's doing it
for everyone else's.

494
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,424
He's a showman, that's for sure.

495
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,912
-I wouldn't call him that.
-He would.

496
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,195
So I won't.

497
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:12,382
-You wanna provoke him?
-No.

498
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,674
-I wanna kill him.
-Oh.

499
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:17,382
I think you'll have to play
his game a little longer.

500
00:26:17,424 --> 00:26:18,459
No.

501
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,382
-That's your ego talking.
-Fuck you.

502
00:26:20,424 --> 00:26:21,732
Oh, and now it's shouting.

503
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,792
You wanna go over like you did
with me, full-on attack mode?

504
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:26,682
I'm a coward, Ben,
that's why it worked.

505
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:27,847
But this guy,

506
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,752
I think you'll have to go under
to even get through.

507
00:26:29,774 --> 00:26:32,517
But the question is,
are you the man to do that?

508
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,424
We're not talking about me.

509
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:37,465
We're talking about the feed.

510
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:41,784
It won't help you to keep thinking of him
as a killer or evil incarnate.

511
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,739
He's a showman.

512
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:47,542
And that's not a job title,
it's a psychological need.

513
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,549
[sucking teeth]

514
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,674
Christ,
I'm giving you gold here,

515
00:26:51,715 --> 00:26:54,424
but without a life fee there's not
much more I can tell you.

516
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,355
You're looking good, Ben.

517
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,325
Actually, why did I say that?

518
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,549
That's a total lie.
You're looking haunted.

519
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,300
You know when I killed one
it wasn't enough.

520
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,999
Two, yeah, kinda maybe,
but still not enough.

521
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,924
No number was enough,
would ever be enough.

522
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:11,215
Some things
just can't be satiated, but you know that.

523
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:13,590
Me killing, you saving,
it's the same problem, right?

524
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,899
Never enough
to scratch that itch

525
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,299
so it goes away for good.

526
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,924
[laughing]

527
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,882
Two reports
of the same missing person.

528
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:23,674
One from the store
where she works,

529
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:25,590
-one from her mother.
-The new contestant.

530
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:27,715
Katia Volkova, Russian.

531
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:29,049
Arrived here a year ago.

532
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,274
Last night,
the night she was taken,

533
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:33,840
that was her first day working at the
Campbell's Landing jewelry store.

534
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:37,215
We spoke with her boss there and the last
person to see her before the abduction,

535
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:38,750
a colleague, Sofia Romana.

536
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:41,134
They went for a few
first-day celebration drinks.

537
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:42,719
Where?

538
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,257
Little joint
on 21st and Bay Tree.

539
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,132
All right, pull security footage
from the bar in the local area.

540
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:48,325
What about the mother?

541
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,239
Thought you and me
could handle that.

542
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:52,507
Okay.

543
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,340
[The Presenter] Ms. Green
to the diary room, please.

[Katia screaming]

549
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:16,549
[Katia] Ah, no!

550
00:28:18,674 --> 00:28:20,132
[Ben] Mrs. Volkova,

551
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,674
we have information
about your daughter.

552
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:25,192
She is alive.

553
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:28,882
We can't say
who has her or where,

554
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,465
but she is alive.

555
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:31,965
Oh, thank you.

556
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:34,924
Oh, oh, thank you.

557
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,465
Thank God.

558
00:28:37,894 --> 00:28:40,329
Could you tell us
about any of her friends?

559
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:43,465
This is first time
she been out in months.

560
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:45,757
I-- I was happy for her.

561
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:48,320
I was hoping it was a young man.

562
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,424
So she talked about a young man.

563
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:54,174
No, no,
I just want her to be happy.

564
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,842
I want her to be happy.

565
00:28:55,904 --> 00:28:58,007
[somber music playing]

566
00:28:58,199 --> 00:28:59,360

[sobbing]

568
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:07,409
[Cathy] I feel sick
knowing what we know.

569
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:09,465
[Ben] Better she doesn't.

570
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:14,965
This look familiar to you?

571
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:18,632
[suspenseful music playing]

572
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,062
This is it.

573
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,877
I'll get forensics down here.

574
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:38,091
It's a long shot,
but maybe they were sloppy.

575
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:49,224
[Katia] Ah!

576
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,549
[Katia] Ah!

577
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:05,249
[The Presenter] Settle
yourself in, welcome.

578
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:07,368
Katia.

579
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:11,091
A genuine Russian
joining our lovely game.

580
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:13,119
How are you feeling?

581
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,228
How do you think I feel?

582
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:21,161
I know a little fearful,
a little cautious.

583
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,245
Maybe, though, there's a thrill of
excitement

584
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:24,924
that you wouldn't wanna admit to.

585
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,258
What's your favorite color?

586
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:28,799
What?

587
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,841
We wanna get to know you.

588
00:30:33,313 --> 00:30:35,306
It would pay to answer.

589
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:37,841
[breathing heavily]

590
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:38,966
Red.

591
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:40,499
As in blood?

592
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:43,201
[breathing heavily]
In the sunset.

593
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,389
Ah.

594
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,008
Favorite place?

595
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,041
Home.

596
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:52,091
Favorite smell?

597
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:55,674
[somber music playing]

598
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:56,758
Home.

599
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:04,176
Tell me,
why is your life worth living?

600
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,299
[sniffling]

601
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:12,328
My son...

602
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:14,883
doesn't know his father.

603
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:18,054
I want him to know his mom.

604
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,383
I want him to know
how to be happy.

605
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:26,981
Thank you, Katia.

606
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:34,008
[sorrowful melody playing]

607
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:35,731
Now's as good a time as any.

[door creaks open]

609
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:39,049

[suspenseful music playing]

611
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:41,716
No.

[Katia grunting]

613
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:45,424
Ah!

[Katia breathing heavily]

615
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,341
No!

616
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:00,383
[screaming]

617
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:06,341

[Katia grunting in agony]

619
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:15,473
The smell will go away
along with the pain.

620
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:18,549
Just in time for the show.

621
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:22,341

[Katia sobbing]

624
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:37,349
[Cathy] So what do we know
so far?

625
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:41,273
Katia Volkova.
32. Born in Russia.

626
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:43,829
Came to the US last year
with her son Lev, now six.

627
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:47,246
Lives at an East Portland address
registered to her mother, Inga.

628
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:50,466
Started a new job at the Campbell's
Landing jewelry store two days ago.

629
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:53,347
Blue, Sasha Morgan,

630
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,806
who we also know that we know
nothing about his disappearance

631
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,194
or his movements before that.

632
00:32:58,507 --> 00:33:01,257
White, Alex Chambers,
delivery driver.

633
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:02,702
Taken on the night of the 11th.

634
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:07,257
Red, Chloe Demaine,
substitute teacher.

635
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:08,383
Recently qualified.

636
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,674
Taken two nights after Alex.

637
00:33:10,806 --> 00:33:12,674
Last seen
at her weekly dance class.

638
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:15,841
And Brown, William Elise,

639
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:17,556
security guard
at the Harold Mall.

640
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:20,119
-Anything connecting?
-Not that we know of so far.

641
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:21,574
We know they're all local,

642
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,441
so they aren't searching
too far field for their target victims.

643
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:26,633
And we don't think
that this is money-motivated.

644
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:28,651
None of the captives
are particularly wealthy.

645
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:30,753
So anyone could be
the next target.

646
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:32,674
I don't want the media
getting their hands on this.

647
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:34,611
If the full details
of this goes public,

648
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:36,591
that'll play
right into his game plan.

649
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:38,466
[footsteps approaching]

650
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:39,863
They're going live in ten.

651
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,633
-How do we not know about this?
-There's a schedule.

652
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:44,016
His viewing figures
are already up.

653
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:45,576
Up how? More subscribers?

654
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,576
No, no. A-- anyone
with a fucking laptop.

[thrilling music playing]

656
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:55,781
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

657
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,549
Welcome to Russian Roulette.

658
00:33:57,761 --> 00:33:59,966
Another unlucky loser
on the way.

659
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:12,383
Two guns, two chambers,

660
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:14,008
one bullet each.

661
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,022
But where?

662
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:18,699
And when?

663
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:29,344
Greetings, blood-hungry
brawlers, bastards, and bitches.

664
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,553
How's life?

665
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:32,799
About to end
for one of this lot.

666
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,159
With the contestants
at either end

667
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:37,086
that's Mr. Blue and Mr. Yellow,

668
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:39,192
please pick up a pistol,

669
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:42,924
take a shot,
and pass the weapon along.

670

of course.

[The Presenter] Pistols, please.

676
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:04,411
Or believe me,
next time, throats get cut.

Thank you.

[The Presenter chuckles]

683
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:24,199
I won't allow anyone to accuse me of
not milking this for all it's worth.

We have our unlucky loser,
Mr. White.

And when you see what's in store
for this poor soul,

735
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:47,841
you'll agree that the guy
who blew his brains out was the lucky one.

736
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:50,721
Thank you once again,

to talk about?

00:41:26,836 --> 00:41:28,609
That shithead's sending out
fucking emails now?

-I knew he would.
-Let him.

Because the good news is,
we're in.

-The email was a leaky nut.

Just rolled on
right past the gatekeepers.

-We're undetected?
-Of course, man.

no sign of us.

their reckoning one day.

...the bullet, literally.

But in doing so,
he missed the point...

[imitates death rattle]
...fatally.

[audience
and The Presenter sigh]

801
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,891
[laughs] Now,
before the main event,

802
00:42:32,953 --> 00:42:35,568
I would like to welcome
our new viewers.

have you with us, folks.

-Us?
-You.

809
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:48,718
How does he know
we're watching?

810
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,010
Not from the IP.
We're invisible.

811
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:51,551
You said
we were undetectable.

812
00:42:51,593 --> 00:42:53,551
I told you
he'd be expecting this.

813
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:55,276
Either that
or the setup is seriously,

814
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:57,593
admirably way more sophisticated
than you thought.

815
00:42:57,995 --> 00:42:59,005
How the fuck
are we not able

816
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,638
to shut this whole
fucking shit show down?

Who writes these lines?
Oh, actually I do. [laughs]

829
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:38,256
Happy Dan, you have
30 seconds to make your mind up.

830
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:41,426
As usual,
we ask our plucky loser

831
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:42,930
to say a few final words.

832
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:45,510
Please. Please!

833
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:48,043
[sighs] We got to get 'em
to work on their final words.

834
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:50,233
This is good television.
We're missing a trick.

835
00:43:50,265 --> 00:43:51,665
-We really are.
-[Larch] Impressive.

836
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:53,605
He's gaining confidence.
You notice that?

you chose that one.

A most excellent choice.

842
00:44:05,345 --> 00:44:07,385
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

843
00:44:07,826 --> 00:44:08,970
Oh, my God.

00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:13,561
I finally get to see
what drain cleaner does

to the insides
of a terrified man.

846
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:18,838
[chuckles] I've been wondering
since I was 12.

847
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,260
This is fucking insane.

848
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:25,118
Mr. White, it's been
a pleasure to have you with us.

849
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,090
But as-- who was it?

850
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:28,760
Oh, someone once said,

851
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:31,483
all good things
must come to an end.

852
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:33,280
Bad things too.

853
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,711

he wants it, folks.

you wish for, Ben.

I'm begging. Please.

00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:52,156
I know, but see,

859
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:54,260
this is all about
giving the audience

860
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,891
what they signed up for.

Why didn't you inform the public

that a killer
was on the loose?

-Same thing, boss.

We need to do whatever it takes to shut
this motherfucker down.

two shits who the boss is.

-They're just randoms.

No. This one

We've seen cases
like this before.

952
00:51:05,677 --> 00:51:08,360
There's normally
a sexual element to his actions,

953

even though
he is not showing it now.

954
00:51:10,503 --> 00:51:12,635
Likelihood is
he was traumatized as a child.

955
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:13,955
I'll start profiling.

to this whatsoever.

Basing that on what?

962
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:30,968
I know how sexually sadistic
desires manifest.

00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,510
I lived it for, what,
six years.

964
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:37,185
His are nothing alike. It's a waste of
time and money going down that alley.

00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,057
A sadist, yes.

00:51:39,108 --> 00:51:42,047
And narcissists too with histrionic
tendencies thrown in.

967
00:51:42,528 --> 00:51:45,718
But the biggest thing
to consider here is power.

Power over people.
I don't mean his captives.

00:51:48,535 --> 00:51:49,718

is to be him.

going bigger and better.

that the Bureau is now in charge
of this investigation

1020

what about this little cutie,

No, not the baby, silly.
It's not that kind of a show.

1059

The choice, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, is yours.

-Okay. So this is good.
-What?

We can work this
to our advantage.

This is our chance
to trap him.

1063
00:56:10,718 --> 00:56:12,053
Yeah, but
if we can identify them,

1064
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:14,006
then we can find them,
then we can make them safe.

1065

-Or we can catch him in the act.
-And risk a kidnapping?

01:08:25,213 --> 01:08:27,053
I repeat.
The results show is live.

1248
01:08:27,095 --> 01:08:28,197
Copy that.

1249
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:34,428
[The Presenter] You again?

1250
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:35,868
Welcome. Welcome.

1251
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:39,202
To the results edition
of Russian Roulette.

1252
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:41,885
Let's remind ourselves
of why we are here.

1253
01:08:42,436 --> 01:08:44,595
I didn't say I wouldn't play.

1254
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:46,886
I said I lose.

1255
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:49,345
You gotta hand it
to Mr. White there.

1256
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:52,052
That was bold, ballsy.

1257
01:08:52,243 --> 01:08:54,095
Made me rethink things.

1258
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,302
And I want to honor him
for the samurai he is.

1259
01:08:59,975 --> 01:09:02,553
No, not Samurai, exactly.

1260
01:09:03,523 --> 01:09:05,552
Kamikaze would be more apt.

1261
01:09:06,612 --> 01:09:09,178
[tense music plays]

1262
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:17,556
So my preening public,
we have two lucky losers.

1263
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:20,636
I know. Two.
How entertaining is that?

1264
01:09:20,988 --> 01:09:22,677
[laughs]
But who's it gonna be?

1265
01:09:22,939 --> 01:09:25,393
Is it gonna be
Mr. White or Miss Red?

1266
01:09:27,178 --> 01:09:28,678
[computer chimes]

1267
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:30,595
And it seems
you can't decide either.

1268
01:09:30,636 --> 01:09:33,470
And I don't blame you.
They're equally killable.

1269
01:09:33,511 --> 01:09:35,136
[chuckles] I'll tell you what.

1270
01:09:35,178 --> 01:09:39,297
Why don't we ask
our friend at the Portland PD,

1271
01:09:39,898 --> 01:09:41,760
seeing as you
and your fed pals

1272
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:43,850
are so keen to get involved
in our little project here?

1273
01:09:43,882 --> 01:09:45,288
Let's get you involved.

1274
01:09:45,788 --> 01:09:47,231
Are you watching,

1275
01:09:47,553 --> 01:09:50,341
Detective Ben Jacobs?

1276
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:53,537
Portland's very own short fuse,
ladies and gentlemen,

1277
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:58,189
with a trigger all his own,
his beloved mother and sister.

1278
01:09:58,231 --> 01:09:59,346
Are you there, Ben?

1279
01:10:00,096 --> 01:10:01,679
[phone buzzing]

1280
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,074
Cathy.

1281
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:12,721
I don't think you should be
in here for this, Lisa.

1282
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:23,289
Well, I don't know
how long we can hang around.

1283
01:10:23,321 --> 01:10:25,137
I-- hang around.

1284
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:26,471

1286
01:10:28,178 --> 01:10:30,179
Am I good or am I good,
huh? [laughs]

1287
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:32,304
Okay. Good to go.

1288
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:35,603
I'm engaging.

1289
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:36,655
Affirmative.

1290
01:10:38,471 --> 01:10:39,846
[computer chimes]

1291
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:41,179
[The Presenter]
Ah, there you are.

1292
01:10:41,221 --> 01:10:44,173
Of course, you are. I mean, you wouldn't
wanna miss this either, would you?

1293
01:10:44,276 --> 01:10:46,356
I mean,
what else is there to watch?

1294
01:10:46,418 --> 01:10:48,293
[laughs] Ben.

1295
01:10:48,554 --> 01:10:52,454
Sergeant Benjamin Andrew Jacobs,

1296
01:10:52,516 --> 01:10:53,909
I have a gift for you.

1297
01:10:54,596 --> 01:10:56,669
The gift of a choice.

1298
01:10:56,981 --> 01:11:00,248
White or red? Red or white.

1299
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:02,831
-What the fuck?
-The choice is yours.

1300
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:05,454
Think of yourself lucky
you didn't have to bid for the privilege.

1301
01:11:05,904 --> 01:11:07,583
Strike teams, are you there?

1302
01:11:08,576 --> 01:11:09,721
Five minutes out.

1303
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:12,887
Five fucking minutes.
Don't be shy now.

1304
01:11:13,009 --> 01:11:14,766
If you don't choose,
I'll choose.

1305
01:11:14,894 --> 01:11:16,829
And I'll choose
to kill 'em both.

1306
01:11:16,969 --> 01:11:19,887
It would, after all,
be the only fair thing to do.

1307
01:11:20,559 --> 01:11:22,596
This is so fucked up.

1308
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:25,144
You can't do this, Ben.

1309
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,262
-You can't kill one.
-I'm saving one.

1310
01:11:27,923 --> 01:11:29,083
Jesus.

1311
01:11:29,471 --> 01:11:31,179
-Ben--
-What do you want me to do?

1312
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:33,304
You want me to let both die?

1313
01:11:33,546 --> 01:11:34,637
Wait.

1314
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:36,221
The strike teams
are on their way.

1315
01:11:36,262 --> 01:11:37,637
He's bluffing.

1316
01:11:37,804 --> 01:11:39,179
-This guy does not bluff.
-Let it play out.

1317
01:11:39,221 --> 01:11:40,427
-Cathy-- Cathy--
-Ben--

1318
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:42,193
I'm gonna have to put
a clock on you, Ben.

1319
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:45,671
You see, my viewers, they don't like
no awkward silences.

1320
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,065
-Strike teams, are you there?
-Two minutes out.

1321
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:51,971
We don't
fucking have two minutes.

1322
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:56,096
[sirens wailing]

1323
01:12:07,213 --> 01:12:08,353
Going dark.

1324
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:11,137
If we cannot rely on you
to make a moral choice,

1325
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,346
who can we rely on?

1326
01:12:12,387 --> 01:12:14,706
[laughs] The likes of me.

1327
01:12:15,137 --> 01:12:17,180

Alpha [indistinct] Charlie.

1332
01:12:36,655 --> 01:12:39,046
Gonna have to push you
for an answer, Ben.

1333
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:40,555
Talk to me.

1334
01:12:43,637 --> 01:12:45,195
Alpha team,
there's nothing here.

1335

warehouse is empty.

1338

Ben, come on now.

1339
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:57,596
This is a matter of civic duty.

1340
01:12:57,808 --> 01:13:02,721
In five, four, three, two, one.

1341
01:13:05,033 --> 01:13:06,623
And there it is.

1342
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:08,596
You've chosen to save Ms. Red

1343
01:13:08,637 --> 01:13:11,280
and kill the old warrior.

1344
01:13:11,711 --> 01:13:12,721

into town next time.
