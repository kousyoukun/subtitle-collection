1
00:00:56,213 --> 00:01:00,292
<i>In the year of our Lord, 1442.<i>

2
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:05,996
<i>The Turkish Sultan enslaved
1,000 Transylvanian boys<i>

3
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:10,041
<i>to fill the ranks of his army.<i>

4
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:16,478
<i>These child slaves were beaten without mercy.<i>

5
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:19,588
<i>Trained to kill without conscience,<i>

6
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,455
<i>to crave blood of...all who fight...<i>

7
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,399
the Turks.

8
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,326
<i>From among these boys...<i>

9
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:38,603
<i>one grew into a warrior, so fierce...<i>

10
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:41,142
<i>that entire armies would
retreat in terror...<i>

11
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:43,340
<i>with the mention of his name.<i>

12
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,542
<i>Vlad the Impaler.<i>

13
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,572
<i>Son...of the Dragon.<i>

14
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,240
<i>Sickened by his monstrous act,<i>

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,269
<i>Vlad came to bury his past with the dead<i>

16
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,337
and returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.<i>

17
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:07,635
<i>His subjects called him Prince.<i>

18
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,004
<i>I call him father<i>

19
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,610
<i>but the world would come to know him as...<i>

20
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,107
<i>Dracula.<i>

21
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,854
I left it...

22
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:37,940
where I found it.

23
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:42,887
What do you think, Vlad?

24
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:48,482
Bring it to me.

25
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:04,631
This belongs to a scout.
One of Hamza Bey's men.

26
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:07,860
What the hell is a lone
Turk doing out here?

27
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:13,124
Turkish scouts never travel alone.
If there is one, there is more.

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,302
And whatever they scout...
they conquer.

29
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:26,661
This is washed downstream.

30
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:32,868
It came from up there.

31
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:35,583
<i>Broken Tooth Mountain.<i>

32
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:40,539
Soon it'll be night.
They'll seek refuge.

33
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,530
Dumitru, I need you to return to the castle.
Alert the guards and double the sentry.

34
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,165
What? I'm not leaving you here.

35
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:51,291
The Turks crossed into my land
unannounced, it's a sign of war.

36
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,870
What are you going to do
if you find them?

39
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:56,156
I'll do what Princes do best, negotiate.

40
00:03:57,561 --> 00:03:59,131
Nicolai, Andre, with me.

41
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:04,507
<i>Move it.<i>

42
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,145
Anything?

43
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:47,507
Smells like your feet.

44
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:01,339
They're inside.

45
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,009
How do you know?

46
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:06,784
Bats don't come out during the day.
Something's disturbed them.

47
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,518
Come on.

48
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:00,049
What is it, my Lord?

49
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:02,935
The floor...

50
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,042
it's crushed bone.

51
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,451
The Turks didn't do this.

52
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:21,827
What's that?

53
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,473
We leave, now!

54
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,805
<i>The creature you encountered
was no accident, my Prince.<i>

55
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,516
Four nights ago every brother in our order
awoke from an identical dream,

56
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:47,778
I would not have thought it possible, had I not
suffered the same vision myself that night.

57
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,553
All these creatures lay siege to this holy place.

58
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:59,277
<i>The Romans mystics prophesized
the coming of a great evil.<i>

59
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:01,717
<i>A vampire.<i>

60
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:06,103
From the Greek word, Vry...

61
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,355
'to drink'.

62
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,811
<i>The beast was once a mortal man,<i>

63
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,592
<i>who summoned the demon from the depth of hell<i>

64
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,874
<i>to trade for his dark power.<i>

65
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:21,351
<i>The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish<i>

66
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:25,577
<i>but his price was eternally condemned
to the darkness of that cave,<i>

67
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:29,042
<i>where he remains until he finds another...<i>

68
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:31,741
<i>to set him free.<i>

69
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,670
Now you know its true face.

70
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:40,509
The people of Transylvania lived
in enough fear of the Turks' return.

71
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:44,552
Promise me you'll guard
this secret, brother.

72
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:57,997
Papa!

73
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:00,949
I miss you.

74
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,418
And I , you.

75
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,310
My big soldier.

76
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:13,079
What, an embrace, but no kiss?

77
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:16,318
- Are we going to argue?
- You always leaving me and my family.

78
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:20,610
I miss you.

79
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,778
Something troubles you, what is it?

80
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:30,439
Only the impossible depth of your beauty,

81
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,235
puts the rest of the world to shame.

82
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:36,528
Pay no attention to your father, Ingeras.

83
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,834
Flattery is a cheap distraction from truth.

84
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,653
Ah, she knows all my tricks.

85
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,307
You're a terrible liar.
It's one of your most endearing qualities.

86
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:48,363
It's Ingeras' time for bed.

87
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,381
- Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?
- Of course we can.

88
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,643
- You most certainly cannot!
- Why not?

89
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:04,041
Because tomorrow is the
day of our risen Lord.

90
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:06,381
- Ah, of course.
- That's Easter.

91
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,798
What was I thinking...

92
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:16,739
So, what attacked you?

93
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:19,191
Wolves?

94
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:21,908
I suppose.

95
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,746
All I know...is that I've
lost two good men today.

96
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,084
There is something more...

97
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,130
I was the same age as Ingeras,
when I was sent to live with the Turks.

98
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:02,134
To fight for them.

99
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,290
If I never saw another,
it would be too soon.

100
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:13,349
You're home now.

101
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:18,130
For almost as many years as you were gone.

102
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,636
I just want peace...

103
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,163
that's all.

104
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:52,285
My fellow Transylvanians, an Easter toast.

105
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:55,096
Ten years of peace and prosperity,

106
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,356
ever since our Prince came back to us.

107
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,530
My old friend, here is to 20 more.

108
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:36,470
Hamza Bey... welcome.

109
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:39,035
We were not expecting you so soon.

110
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:43,387
Sultan Mehmed The Second offers
his salutations to you and your son.

111
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,294
Thank you. I have his tribute ready.

112
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:57,958
I am afraid...there is something more
than a tribute to discuss.

113
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,912
The Turks have no enemies here.

114
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,999
Did you think we would not have noticed a battalion of our scouts...

115
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,345
- ...missing?
- I did not kill them.

116
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:10,735
It still lives inside you, Lord Impaler.

117
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:15,409
Locked in a dark cage, hidden away.

118
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:22,165
But you and I, we both know it's there.

119
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,487
The Sultan's tribute, take it and leave.

120
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,662
There is one last thing.

121
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:49,831
The Sultan requires
1,000 boys to join his Janissary call.

122
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:53,841
- No!
- Never!

123
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:58,377
Janissary! He ended
that practice years ago.

124
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:02,508
When a soldier is plucked as a child...

125
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,986
and raised to know no other life...

126
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,899
he'll kill without question
and die without complaint.

127
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:15,161
Any who are 15 years of age or older,
will fight in Hungary.

128
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:19,221
Those 10 to 14 will be made
ready for the seize on Vienna.

129
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,576
The Sultan expects obedience.

130
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:28,166
After all...it was your own father
who gave you up without a fight.

131
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:36,381
Soft, but they'll do.

132
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,267
Don't, please.

133
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,647
Do you know who I am?

134
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,080
You mean who you were.

135
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,995
You have no army and no choice, Prince.

136
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,565
Follow our command,
or suffer the consequences.

137
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:11,958
It must be done.

138
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:16,283
Courage, anger, even love,
none of these can matter to a Prince.

139
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:20,018
All that matters is his
duty to his people.

140
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,555
What does it mean to be a royal hostage?

141
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:30,735
My father gave me to the Sultan
to prove his loyalty.

142
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,907
Were you scared there? With them?

143
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,845
I wanted to make my father proud.

144
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,549
Do you have to give me to the Sultan?

145
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:46,103
That was a long time ago.

146
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,817
You've nothing to worry about,
do you understand?

147
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,822
Good.

148
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:16,237
If I defied the order, they'd
kill a 100 for every one I saved.

149
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,642
You told me you and Mehmed
were once like brothers.

150
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:22,844
Why didn't you ask...

151
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,746
Isn't it possible he might
show you some mercy?

152
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,427
Have you seen the like of it?

153
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,539
Soon the entire world will be Turk.

154
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:13,798
Lord Impaler...

155
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,231
my oldest of friends.

156
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:21,040
I miss our days together.

157
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:23,081
What I missed my time with you...

158
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:24,601
is the coffee.

159
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:28,810
It's true, my father's power is
a cruel place for a young boy far from home.

160
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,717
But soon you talked like us,
prayed like us, fought like us...

161
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:39,422
speakig of which...I am owed 1,000 boys.

162
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:43,749
Why have I not seen them?

163
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,643
Mehmed, my brother.

164
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,766
- I will grant you anything else...
- I need soldiers...

165
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:53,844
brother.

166
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:01,899
Then take me.

167
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,176
I'm worth a 1,000 boys and you know it.

168
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:10,061
- Those kings would tremble if they knew.
- Then accept my offer.

169
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,070
When we were boys, how I longed
to fight side-by-side.

170
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,857
But now I'm Sultan, what need have I
for one more soldier?

171
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,726
I will have my 1000 boys.

172
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:23,250
And one more.

173
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:28,419
<i>Your son will be raised under my roof.<i>

174
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:32,093
<i>Just like you were raised
under the roof by my father.<i>

175
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:34,713
You may retain your throne.

176
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,059
But General Ismail will remain to see
that my orders are fulfilled.

177
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,118
Please. Do not do this.

178
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:44,859
What is one son?

179
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,074
If you're virile, you'll make plenty more.

180
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,274
You promised this would never happen.

181
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:28,791
- Marina, listen...
- The day you asked for my hand,
do you remember what I said?

182
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,247
You said: 'No, stay my only friend..."

183
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:33,512
I knew what happens to
the sons of the Queen.

184
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:35,448
You said things would be different.

185
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,243
You said that if I loved you, I should trust you.

186
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,726
- I love you.
- Then trust me.

187
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:43,313
That's a death wish to start a war.

188
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:45,560
The Great Impaler can't please his woman.

189
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:48,625
It's fine, boys.
Just saying the goodbyes, that's all.

190
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:51,473
Promise me, he's my family!

191
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:54,272
Stop it, don't touch me!

192
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:57,580
I won't let them do that!!

193
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:08,157
I'll go!

194
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:20,388
I can do it.

195
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:24,887
You're proud of me, aren't you?

196
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:27,560
Of course, I am.

197
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,624
You have chosen wisely

198
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:47,654
but I've to say...I'm a little disappointed, frankly...

199
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,579
I expected more...resistance from you.

200
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,041
- Run to your mother.
- What?

201
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:09,566
Now!!

202
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,775
Mehmed will punish all of Transylvania
for what you have done.

203
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,688
It's not a child's place
to save his country.

204
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:09,804
Get my family to the castle.

205
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:14,045
Mehmed will be sending others soon enough.
War will come!

206
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:16,494
You can't protect us.

207
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:20,893
I'll find a way.

208
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:24,289
Vlad, where are you going?

209
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:28,128
Whatever horror in Broken Tooth,
I know it kills Turks.

210
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:31,657
<i>You returned...<i>

211
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:38,657
<i>No one has ever returned...<i>

212
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:48,072
It seems no one has ever had
the privilege of leaving either.

213
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:51,125
<i>Neither will you.<i>

214
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:33,040
Those men were reeked of fear

215
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:37,945
and you...I sense hope.

216
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,316
Your silver offends me, cloak it from my sight.

217
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:57,219
What kind of man crawled into his own grave
in search of hope, hm?

218
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:59,613
A desperate one.

219
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:03,151
The Turks threaten to destroy my kingdom.

220
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,968
Power like yours...I could stop them.

221
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,993
Save my people,
save my family.

222
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,731
How supremely noble, Lord Impaler,

223
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,517
Haus Dracul,
Son of the Devil.

224
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,151
You are mistaken.

225
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:27,118
It means Son of the Dragon,
protector of the innocent.

226
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,736
Do your people know
how many innocents you've killed?

227
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:36,609
Was it...hundreds?

228
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,408
Yes.

229
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:46,878
Lie to me again and I'll open
you from your belly to your brain

230
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,943
and feed on your intestine.

231
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:50,490
Thousands.

232
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:53,124
And when you put them to the stake,
what did you feel?

233
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,842
Shame, horror, power?

234
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,697
- Answer me!
- Nothing!

235
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:05,483
I felt nothing.
No greater crime than the act itself.

236
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:09,217
Then why spill blood if not
for the pleasure of it?

237
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:14,452
Because men do not fear swords...
they fear monsters.

238
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:20,806
They run from them. By putting
one village
to the stake, I spared ten more.

239
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:24,753
Sometimes the world no longer needs a hero.

240
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:29,114
Sometimes what it needs...is a monster.

241
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:34,093
And you believe you know what it is,
to be a monster? Hm?

242
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:03,948
You have no idea

243
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:09,240
but I am going to show you.

244
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:15,257
For centuries these mouldering walls
have been my gallows

245
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:19,539
and I'm bound to this cave, condemned by the one who turned me.

246
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:24,005
Oh, I've waited an eternity
for a man of your strength,

247
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:28,607
your gifts, your will.
A man, worthy of the dark...

248
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,591
and all it's powers.

249
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:36,210
For if I am your salvation,
you are mine.

250
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,223
Drink, you will have a taste of my power

251
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,456
and the strength of 100 men,

252
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:53,847
the speed of a falling star,

253
00:27:53,927 --> 00:28:00,143
dominion over the night and all it's creatures,
to see and hear through their senses.

254
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:07,183
- Even heals grievous wounds...
- At what price?

255
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:12,699
Once you drink, your thirst
for human blood will be insatiable.

256
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:17,426
But if you can resist for three days...

257
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:22,259
you'll return to your mortal state,
having sampled my power,

258
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,542
perhaps save your people.

259
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:28,841
- And if I feed?
- The price will be worse than if
you'd never stepped in here.

260
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:35,715
But I'll be set free.
Having granted the darkness worthy of my offering,

261
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:38,708
you'll become its vessel, as I am.

262
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,296
A scourge on this earth,
designed to destroy

263
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:48,146
everything you hold dear.
Your land, your people, even your precious wife and son.

264
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:51,972
- I would die before I harm them.
- Indeed you'll, I'm afraid.

265
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:58,280
I, however, would at last be free to unleash
my wrath against the one who betrayed me.

266
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:05,619
And one day, I will call on you to serve me, my
pawn, ending the mortal game...of revenge.

267
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:10,322
- This is not a game!
- Aah, won't better way to endure eternity?

268
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:13,932
For this, little Prince, is the ultimate game.

269
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:17,279
Light versus dark.

270
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:19,345
Hope versus despair.

271
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:24,234
And all the world's fate
hangs in the balance.

272
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:28,325
And it will be my great pleasure
to disappoint you.

273
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:30,331
Drink.

274
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:37,412
Let the games begin.

275
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,929
What now?

276
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,005
Now...

277
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,124
you die.

278
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:32,652
Papa!

279
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:00,716
Fire!

280
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,434
- You came back.
- I always will.

281
00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:37,110
- Where were you?
- Searching for the strength I needed.

282
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:39,014
You're back.

283
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,414
A good Prince would had given them up!

284
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:02,551
A good Prince would have
paid that price for peace.

285
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,772
But I give you my word...

286
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:09,157
we will not be defeated!

287
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,130
They brought war to our land!

288
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,294
They will pay dearly for it.

289
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,439
Fire!

290
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:47,746
Negotiations failed.

291
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,857
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight.

292
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,182
Trust only that I will use all I have
to keep us safe.

293
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,229
But we will not be safe if we stay here!

294
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:04,498
We must leave directly for Cosia Monastery.
It's high in the mountains,

295
00:38:04,878 --> 00:38:06,304
too remote for cannon fire.

296
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:09,007
It's our best chance of survival.

297
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:13,087
We'll take enough of our people
so that our absence is noticed.

298
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:16,944
That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here,

299
00:38:18,377 --> 00:38:20,083
he'll come hunting for us.

300
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,207
Word, from Castle Dracula.

301
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:25,318
Vlad has defeated thousands of our men.

302
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:30,333
Then send a hundred thousand,
I'll lead them.

303
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:35,468
When I march into Europe,
I will have his head upon my spear

304
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:38,646
and his child at my side.

305
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,628
<i>We can fight the way our great
grandfathers fought.<i>

306
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:46,520
Use the forests, the mountains around
the Burgo Pass.

307
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,831
- 4 or 5 months of that.
- Not months.

308
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm going to win this war in three days.

309
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:57,351
Why not two?
That'd really impress us.

310
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:30,184
What is it?

311
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:34,859
I need some air.

312
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:36,940
I'm sorry.

313
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:58,940
Don't think I haven't noticed
you following me.

314
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,199
You're mistaken.

315
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:06,581
I follow them. They recognize
one of their own.

316
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:10,256
The night is their kingdom...

317
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,720
blood, their sustenance.

318
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:19,925
And some they say, can live for
as long as there're prey to be devoured.

319
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,212
Spare me your ravings.

320
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:26,958
They said the one who escaped the mountain,

321
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:30,155
hides behind the face of a man.

322
00:41:30,977 --> 00:41:34,165
Well, if that man is me...

323
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:37,090
you know a knife would not
do you any good.

324
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:39,032
Of course not.

325
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:43,459
Why do you think I stayed?

326
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,670
I know there is only

327
00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:53,944
so far on this earth they can run

328
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:59,326
and it's not far enough.

329
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:04,937
Let me serve you.

330
00:42:17,988 --> 00:42:19,808
Stay away from me.

331
00:42:25,555 --> 00:42:27,278
Yes, master.

332
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:43,975
<i>Fulfill your destiny.<i>

333
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:47,626
<i>Set me free.<i>

334
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:08,349
We found him in the field.
He ​​asked for you.

335
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:15,556
A message from Prince Vlad.

336
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:19,088
He hopes...you enjoy the view.

337
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:11,440
Your scars are gone?

338
00:44:15,578 --> 00:44:17,054
What's happening to you?

339
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:27,093
I met a dead man on Brooken Tooth.

340
00:44:28,787 --> 00:44:32,498
Not a ghost...something else.

341
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:48,088
No! Stop it!
Let God strike down whoever did this to you.

342
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:49,530
I chose this.

343
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:54,159
This is the strength you sought?

344
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,051
But why?

345
00:45:01,593 --> 00:45:03,867
Because I sent corpses back to Mehmed

346
00:45:05,207 --> 00:45:06,303
instead of our son.

347
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:11,578
- You did this for us?
- In two days I'll be restored.

348
00:45:13,998 --> 00:45:15,376
I just have to resist.

349
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:19,276
Resist what?

350
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,991
Resist what, Vlad?
Tell me!

351
00:45:27,096 --> 00:45:27,821
The thirst...

352
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:30,993
for blood.

353
00:45:36,598 --> 00:45:38,120
And if you were to give in?

354
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,821
Then I become this for eternity.

355
00:45:47,587 --> 00:45:50,611
You will not do this, won't you?

356
00:45:51,895 --> 00:45:54,901
I swear, I will not give in.

357
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,104
Then God will forgive you.

358
00:46:00,185 --> 00:46:00,685
Vlad!

359
00:46:01,778 --> 00:46:04,228
Mehmed is getting closer.
You might want to move out soon.

360
00:46:06,002 --> 00:46:08,317
I need you to get to the monastery
as quickly as you can.

361
00:46:08,574 --> 00:46:10,214
- Mehmed's men will be close behind.
- No!

362
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:10,951
Listen to me.

363
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:13,450
I will reach you after sundown.

364
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:14,855
I promise you.

365
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:24,649
I love you.

366
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:41,347
My husband agrees with your council.

367
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:44,934
We'll depart now,
under your temporary command.

368
00:46:45,128 --> 00:46:49,144
- What? Where is Vlad going to be?
- Spying on the Turks.

369
00:46:50,347 --> 00:46:52,866
- He insists on doing his own reconnaissance.
- No.

370
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:56,703
- I won't allow it.
- It's too late. He's already gone.

371
00:47:00,813 --> 00:47:03,782
All right, everyone,
prepare to move out!

372
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,730
Tell the Sultan where his
enemies will be buried.

373
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:54,126
Listen.

374
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:57,828
We are nearly there.

375
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:17,580
Go to the rear!

376
00:48:51,855 --> 00:48:54,515
Couldn't these monks put the gate
a little bit closer!

377
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:06,938
Stay behind me.

378
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:30,495
Didn't the Turks teach you anything, eh?
I saw your blade coming from...

379
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:36,178
Ingeras, run!

380
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:38,658
Where is your prince now,

381
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:41,158
My Lady?

382
00:50:16,218 --> 00:50:17,632
It's OK.

383
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,943
It's OK.

384
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:23,402
Vlad...

385
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,530
Dumitru, listen, listen!

386
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:55,476
Come here.

387
00:50:57,842 --> 00:51:00,167
Never leave us again, Papa.

388
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,403
Never.
I will always watch over you.

389
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,627
<i>To the gate!<i>

390
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:19,396
<i>Keep moving along!<i>
<i>This way!<i>

391
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:35,822
You should never have strayed from us.

392
00:51:35,857 --> 00:51:38,049
- <i>whatever your reasons were.<i>
- Quiet!

393
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:45,634
- Get these men off their knees!
- Stand up, do you hear me? Stand up!

394
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:51,116
The Turks are coming!
Prayers will not defend these walls!

395
00:51:58,065 --> 00:51:59,851
Do you believe we can do this?

396
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,607
Mehmed's men will be coming from the north.

397
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:08,982
Double our sentries on
the perimeter walls. Go! Do it now!

398
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:10,005
What's in there?

399
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:15,346
Something I hoped to never use again.

400
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,974
Come now.

401
00:52:28,665 --> 00:52:31,184
The men say that Vlad has become a monster.

402
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:35,797
I fear this will only inflate the rumors
of the Prince's dark magic.

403
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:37,503
Only if we allow it.

404
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:41,353
Men cannot fear what they cannot see.

405
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:51,522
<i>Remember when you first joined my army?<i>

406
00:52:52,184 --> 00:52:54,861
<i>You wanted to pick up your sword and fight!<i>

407
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:59,691
When my generals blindfolded you...

408
00:53:00,598 --> 00:53:05,052
you did not believe that you could
march without seeing

409
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,979
but you could.

410
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:15,612
<i>Now march with me.
Your Sultan will guide you!<i>

411
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:18,969
Prince Vlad, the vampire is
vulnerable to daylight

412
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:25,107
and to pure silver.

413
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:34,601
Yet the Holy Cross exerts
no power over you.

414
00:54:35,222 --> 00:54:38,509
That can only mean you have yet
to seal your fate with human blood.

415
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:43,895
Let me kill you now, my Prince,
please,

416
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:48,768
before your people do.
Rumors have spread of what you've become.

417
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,343
You can still repent.

418
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:54,763
You'll do well to run, Lucian.

419
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,008
<i>It's true, he's a monster!<i>

420
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:22,858
Please, listen. He is your Prince.
Give him a chance to explain!

421
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:27,390
- Please! Stop, please!
- <i>Kill the monster!<i>

422
00:55:28,302 --> 00:55:30,165
Satan lives in his heart!

423
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:56,713
He was trying to save his soul.

424
00:56:09,688 --> 00:56:13,204
Take him to my room and shut the door.
Do not let him not look outside.

425
00:56:13,434 --> 00:56:14,533
- OK.
- Mama!

426
00:56:43,557 --> 00:56:47,384
This is your loyalty?
Your gratitude?

427
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:49,891
Fools.

428
00:56:51,632 --> 00:56:54,562
Do you think you're alive
because you can fight?

429
00:56:58,173 --> 00:57:00,744
You're alive because of me!

430
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,292
Because of what I did to save you!

431
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:17,197
This is not who you are.

432
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:35,376
Return to your stations.

433
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:40,641
Believe me, there's
still more to fear!

434
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:46,460
Lord,

435
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,115
if you've not yet forsaken me,

436
00:57:49,824 --> 00:57:52,734
grant me the strength to resist the darkness.

437
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:57,317
Allow me to endure this test one more day.

438
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:02,188
I beg you.

439
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:05,413
Please...

440
00:58:23,655 --> 00:58:24,538
Are you sick?

441
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:32,550
If you're sick, I thought
this might make you feel better.

442
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,126
Thank you. Come.

443
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,156
You'll make a great leader some day

444
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,443
You think of others before yourself.

445
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:02,000
When the Turks came to take me,
you stopped them.

446
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,285
That's why you got sick, isn't it?
To save me?

447
00:59:10,438 --> 00:59:11,723
Yes,

448
00:59:14,347 --> 00:59:16,403
and I'll do it all again.

449
00:59:49,738 --> 00:59:51,382
<i>They are almost here.<i>

450
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:58,437
Dawn will be breaking soon
and with it the loss of my power.

451
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:04,795
- If we've not won this war by then...
- I'll fight beside you until death.

452
01:00:05,192 --> 01:00:06,891
Your death would end my fight.

453
01:00:07,695 --> 01:00:09,965
We have done the duty of any good parent,

454
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:12,463
protected our child,

455
01:00:12,784 --> 01:00:14,649
protected all the children in the kingdom.

456
01:00:16,095 --> 01:00:18,596
Perhaps our destiny was
not to rule in this life.

457
01:00:21,212 --> 01:00:22,821
Do you remember our wedding vow?

458
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,325
Why think separately of
this life and the next...

459
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,267
...when one is born from the last.

460
01:00:31,398 --> 01:00:34,648
Time is always too short
for those who need it .

461
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,721
But for those who love...last forever.

462
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,531
<i>Hold your positions!<i>

463
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:51,689
Fire!

464
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:30,816
Where is he?

465
01:04:31,254 --> 01:04:32,686
Fire!

466
01:04:43,962 --> 01:04:46,792
Find your father, go!

467
01:04:58,816 --> 01:04:59,929
Where is he?

468
01:05:09,111 --> 01:05:11,435
You can keep running if you like.

469
01:05:21,154 --> 01:05:22,223
Mama!

470
01:05:24,432 --> 01:05:27,203
- <i>Let me go!<i>
- No!

471
01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:28,203
Mirena!

472
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:38,030
- No, please.
- Ingeras!

473
01:06:56,881 --> 01:06:58,109
Please stay with me.

474
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:01,608
I cannot do this without you.

475
01:07:25,553 --> 01:07:27,193
There's still time
for you to stop them.

476
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:31,794
Drink my blood.

477
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,077
No... I cannot take your life.

478
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:39,770
My life is lost already

479
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,536
but our son's is not.

480
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,640
I love you.

481
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:55,942
Do it now!

482
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:03,567
Please.

483
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:11,224
Do it now.

484
01:09:30,795 --> 01:09:32,306
Do you want vengeance?

485
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:43,664
Drink.

486
01:10:24,905 --> 01:10:27,072
I know now hell is real.

487
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:30,001
So I know there is a heaven.

488
01:10:31,655 --> 01:10:34,144
<i>Neither this world nor the next
shall keep us apart.<i>

489
01:10:36,893 --> 01:10:40,958
I will honor your sacrifice and I vow
that our son shall be safe.

490
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:52,417
Of all my lands,
this is the one I love the least.

491
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:57,836
Look to the East.

492
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:02,144
The sun should be risen by now,
should it not?

493
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,674
What is that?

494
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:21,903
It is the Prince.
He's coming.

495
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:12,447
I used to think
there were too many of you.

496
01:12:12,968 --> 01:12:14,718
Now, it's not enough.

497
01:13:12,886 --> 01:13:15,051
I understand you've a weakness

498
01:13:16,155 --> 01:13:17,180
for silver.

499
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:28,534
<i>Papa!<i>

500
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:33,047
He is waiting for you.

501
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,176
You're slower brother...and weaker.

502
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:27,172
<i>Go on, take it.<i>

503
01:14:28,436 --> 01:14:31,166
Is this the monster that terrified my men?

504
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:37,013
You grow more weary by the moment.

505
01:14:39,235 --> 01:14:43,724
Tell me, how long
can you bear it in here, huh?

506
01:14:46,346 --> 01:14:49,050
Long enough to strike
your name from the history books.

507
01:15:24,115 --> 01:15:25,173
<i>Papa!<i>

508
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:32,899
Take a last look at your father, Ingeras.

509
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:35,334
- No!
- Look how pathetic he is.

510
01:15:35,414 --> 01:15:37,501
Stop, please!

511
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,821
If I put a stake thru' your heart,

512
01:15:50,864 --> 01:15:52,030
it will kill you...

513
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,288
like any other man.

514
01:15:58,358 --> 01:16:02,838
- A fitting death,
for Lord...Impaler.
- No!

515
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,284
<i>Papa!<i>

516
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:29,483
That's no longer my name.

517
01:16:30,513 --> 01:16:32,037
My name is Dracula.

518
01:16:33,879 --> 01:16:36,140
Son of the Devil.

519
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:18,285
It's all right.
I'm here.

520
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,848
- You old goat.
- I don't feel old.

521
01:17:54,405 --> 01:17:58,744
- How many are left?
- None, except for your son, of course.

522
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:03,208
A distraction we can now...dispense with.

523
01:18:09,262 --> 01:18:10,675
What have I thought you?

524
01:18:11,736 --> 01:18:15,459
Repeated, over and over,
since you were a boy?

525
01:18:17,549 --> 01:18:20,279
All that matters is a
Prince's duty to his people.

526
01:18:21,913 --> 01:18:23,402
Don't you realize?

527
01:18:24,904 --> 01:18:27,559
They all are our enemies now.

528
01:18:27,957 --> 01:18:31,076
When he is gone, you'll be free.

529
01:18:39,033 --> 01:18:42,400
You forget who I am!

530
01:19:20,428 --> 01:19:21,612
Leave him.

531
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:29,878
Come with me, child.

532
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:35,196
Please.

533
01:19:35,969 --> 01:19:37,777
Get back!

534
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:43,905
This has to stop.
Please! Please, Vlad's son.

535
01:19:45,975 --> 01:19:47,813
I do not want to leave you.

536
01:19:48,769 --> 01:19:51,084
- You have to go with him.
- No!

537
01:19:51,742 --> 01:19:53,368
Do not leave his sight.

538
01:19:56,812 --> 01:19:59,295
Please know that I will always love you.

539
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:00,541
Always.

540
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,996
- No!
- Go!

541
01:20:10,155 --> 01:20:12,682
- No!
- You take care of him!

542
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,329
No, papa!

543
01:20:33,038 --> 01:20:34,920
He's safe now, Mirena.

544
01:21:58,909 --> 01:22:01,435
<i>The Turks never conquered
the capitals of Europe.<i>

545
01:22:08,025 --> 01:22:10,636
<i>Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.<i>

546
01:22:13,812 --> 01:22:18,640
<i>But, there're no pictures
or statues of him.<i>

547
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:26,419
<i>I am his legacy.<i>

548
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:32,436
<i>His sacrifice taught me that
even after the darkest night,<i>

549
01:22:32,898 --> 01:22:34,288
<i>the sun will rise again.<i>

550
01:22:35,756 --> 01:22:37,480
Drink, master.

551
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:44,706
<i>For if the heart is strong enough,
the soul is reborn<i>

552
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:49,810
<i>with each new day,<i>

553
01:22:51,918 --> 01:22:54,240
<i>in life after life,<i>

554
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:59,114
<i>age after age,<i>

555
01:23:03,218 --> 01:23:04,924
<i>forever.<i>

556
01:23:30,465 --> 01:23:31,399
Beautiful...

557
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,836
the flowers, my Lady.

558
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:39,043
My lady?

559
01:23:40,957 --> 01:23:44,760
- Where are you from?
- A long way from here.

560
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:52,430
Well, good night.

561
01:23:53,907 --> 01:23:56,231
Why think seperately
of this life and the next...

562
01:23:57,206 --> 01:23:59,349
when one is born from the last.

563
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,714
It's my favorite poem.

564
01:24:08,225 --> 01:24:12,405
It speaks to your yearning,
of one soul pleading for another.

565
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:18,410
I'm Mina.

566
01:24:21,088 --> 01:24:21,927
Vlad.

567
01:24:57,537 --> 01:25:00,533
Let the games begin.

568
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:03,860
