1
00:00:56,827 --> 00:01:00,757
In the year of Lord. 1442.

2
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:06,711
The Turkish Sultan enslaved
1,000 Transylvania boys.

3
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:09,752
To fill the ranks of his army.

4
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:15,547
These child slaves were
beaten without mercy.

5
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,050
Trained to kill without conscience.

6
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,390
To crave the blood..

7
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,250
of all who would
fight the Turks.

8
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,330
From among these boys...

9
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,249
one grew into a warrior, so fearsome that
entire armies would retreat in terror..

10
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,465
to the mention of his name,

11
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:53,010
Vlad the Impaler.
Son of the Dragon.

12
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,710
sickened by his monstrous act...

13
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,530
Vlad came to bury his past with the dead.

14
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,130
And returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.

15
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,970
His subjects called him Prince.
I call him Father.

16
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,450
But the world would come to know him as...

17
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,850
Dracula.

18
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,510
I left it...

19
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,510
where I found it.

20
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,610
What do you think, Vlad?

21
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,970
Bring it to me.

22
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,650
This belongs to a scout.

23
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,710
One of Hamza Bey's men.

24
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,610
What the hell is a lone
Turk doing out here?

25
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,670
Turkish scouts never travel alone.

26
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,890
If there is one, there is more.

27
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,010
And whatever they scout...
they conquer.

28
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,750
This is washed downstream.

29
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,670
It came from up there.

30
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,690
Broken Tooth Mountain.

31
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,710
Soon it will be night.

32
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,710
They'll seek refuge.

33
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,430
Dumitru, I need you to
return to the castle.

34
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,130
Alert the guards and
double the sentury.

35
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,170
What? I'm not leaving you here.

36
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,730
The Turks to cross into my land,
unannounced, is a sign of war.

37
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,590
What are you going to do
if you find them?

38
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,010
I'll do what Princes
do best, negotiate.

39
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,710
Nicolai, Andre, with me.

40
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,750
Anything?

41
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,270
It smell like your feet.

42
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,350
They are inside.

43
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,870
How do you know?

44
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,870
Bats don't come out during the day.

45
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,870
Something's disturbed them.

46
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,370
Come on.

47
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,570
What is it, my Lord?

48
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:09,350
The floor. It's crushed the
bone.The Turks didn't do this.

49
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,170
What's that?

50
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,810
We leave. Now.

51
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,370
The creature you encountered
was no accident, my Prince.

52
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,750
4 nights ago every brother of our order
awoke from an identical dream.

53
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,311
I would not have thought
it possible, had I not..

54
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:48,555
..suffered the same vision
myself that night.

55
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,590
every  creature lands siege
to this holy place.

56
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,490
The Romans mystics prophecized
the coming of a great evil.

57
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,110
A vampire.

58
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,630
From the Greek word, Vry.

59
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,630
To drink.

60
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,850
The beast was once a mortal
man,who summoned the demon..

61
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,150
from the depths of hell, to
trade for his dark power.

62
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,830
The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish.

63
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,050
But his price was eternity condemned
the darkness of that cave.

64
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,370
Where he remains until he finds
another to set him free.

65
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,190
Now you know it's true face.

66
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,750
The people of Transylvania are
living in a fear the Turks return.

67
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,010
Promise me you'll guard
this secret, brother.

68
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,250
Papa!
I've missed you.

69
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,250
And I - you.

70
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,970
My big soldier.

71
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,850
What, an embrace, but no kiss?

72
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,230
Are we going to argue?

73
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,830
You always go away if you want to?

74
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,870
I've missed you.

75
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,850
Something troubles you, what is it?

76
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,990
Only the impossible depths of your beauty.

77
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,530
Puts the rest of the world to shame.

78
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,950
Pay no attention to your father, Ingeras.
Flattery is a cheap distraction from truth.

79
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,250
Ah, she knows all my tricks.

80
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,730
You're a terrible liar.

81
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,930
It's one of your most endearing qualities.

82
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,290
You're just in time for bed.

83
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,770
Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?

84
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,650
Of course we can.

85
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,050
You most certainly cannot!

86
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,830
Why not?

87
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,370
Because tomorrow is the
day of our recent Lord.

88
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,450
Ah, of course.

89
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,450
That's Easter.

90
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,810
What was I thinking...

91
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,190
So, what attacked you?
Wolves?

92
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,210
I suppose.

93
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,770
All I know... is that I've
lost two good men today.

94
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,270
There is something more...

95
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,150
I was the same age as Ingeras, when
I was sent to live with the Turks.

96
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,150
To fight for them.

97
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,510
If I never saw another
it would be too soon.

98
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,630
You're home now.

99
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,070
For almost as many years as you were gone.

100
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,390
I just want peace, that's all.

101
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,310
My fellow Transylvanians,
an Easter toast.

102
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,570
Ten years of peace and prosperity,
ever since our prince came back to us..

103
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,310
My old friend, here's to 20 more..

104
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:39,170
Hamza bey, welcome.We were
not expecting you so soon.

105
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,330
Sultan mehmed II offers his
salutation for you and your son.

106
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,430
Thank you.
I have his tribute ready.

107
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,770
I am afraid there's something
more than attribute to discussed.

108
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,790
The Turk has no enemies here.

109
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,790
Did you think we would notice
a battalion scouts missing ?

110
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,790
I did not kill them.

111
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,150
<i>It still lives inside you, Lord Impaler.</i>

112
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,210
<i>Locked in a dark cage, hidden away.</i>

113
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,150
<i>But you and I.. we both
know that it,s there.</i>

114
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:31,050
The sultan's tribute.
Take it and leave.

115
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,830
There is one last thing.

116
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,510
The Sultan requires 1000 boys
to join his Janissary Corps.

117
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,070
NO! Never.

118
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,930
He ended that practice years ago.

119
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,491
If a soldier is plucked as a child.

120
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:04,835
And is educated, only in this life.

121
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,070
Kill them without question,
and die without complaint.

122
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,010
Any who are 15 years of age or older,
will fight in Hungary.

123
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,270
Those from 10 to 14 will be
made ready for the siege of Vienna.

124
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,290
The sultan expects your abiding.

125
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,410
After all, did not your father give you up
without a fight.

126
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,600
Soft, but they'll do.

127
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,780
Don't, please.

128
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,940
Do you know who I am?

129
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,260
You mean who you were.

130
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,200
You have no army and no choice, prince.

131
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,420
Follow our command, or
suffer the consequences.

132
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,010
It must be done.

133
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,630
Courage, anger love, non of
these can matter to a prince.

134
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,410
All that matter is his duty  to his people.

135
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,350
What does it mean to be a royal hostage?

136
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,990
My father gave me to the
sultan to prove his loyalty.

137
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,390
Were you scared there?
With them?

138
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,290
I wanted to make my father proud.

139
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,410
Do you have to give me to the Sultan?

140
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,850
That was a long time ago.

141
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,970
You have nothing to worry about.

142
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,210
You understand?

143
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,370
Good.

144
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,410
If I defy the order they'll
kill 100 for every one I save.

145
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,930
You told me you and Mehmed
were once like brothers.

146
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:27,150
Why didn't you ask... Isn't it possible
he might show you some mercy?

147
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,400
Have you ever seen the like of it?

148
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,400
Soon the entire world will be Turk.

149
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,540
Lord Impaler.

150
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,780
My oldest of friends.

151
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,240
I miss that days together.

152
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,780
All I miss from my time
with you is the coffee.

153
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,940
It's true that my father's palace was a
cruel place for a young boy far from home.

154
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,940
But soon you talked like us,
prayed like us, fought like us...

155
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,700
speakig of which, I am owed 1,000 boys.

156
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,900
Why I have not seen them?

157
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,050
Mehmed, my brother.

158
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,140
I will grant you anything El's.

159
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I need soldiers, brother.

160
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,840
Then take me.

161
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,340
I'm worth a 1,000 boys
and you know it.

162
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,480
Kings would tremble if they knew.

163
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,480
Then accept my offer.

164
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,020
When we were boys, how I
long to fight side by side.

165
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,540
But now I sultan what I needed to one
soldier. I will have my 1000 boys.

166
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,700
And one more.

167
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,840
Your son will be raised under my roof.

168
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,100
Just as you were raised under
the roof of my father.

169
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,220
You may retain your throne.

170
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,780
But General Ismail will remain to see
that my orders are fulfilled.

171
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,820
So what is one son?
If you're virile, you make plenty more.

172
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:25,355
You promised this would never happen.

173
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:26,135
Merina, listen.

174
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,955
The day you asked for my hand,
do you remember what I said?

175
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:30,655
You said no.

176
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,255
I knew what happened
with the son of a queen.

177
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:38,075
You said things would be different.
You said if I loved you I should trust you.

178
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:39,735
I love you!

179
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,115
-Then trust me!
-It's this or we start a war!

180
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:46,355
The Great Impaler can't
to satisfy his women.

181
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,555
It's just saying goodbyes.That's all.

182
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:51,915
 I will not let them take our
children. I promise to my family!

183
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,215
I won't let them do that.

184
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,235
I'll go.

185
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,235
I'll go.

186
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,635
I can do it.

187
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:25,635
You are proud of me. Aren't you?

188
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:28,135
Of course, I am.

189
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,975
You have chosen wisely.

190
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,875
I have to say, we are
a little disappointed.

191
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:51,575
Frankly, I expected more
resistance from you.

192
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:06,895
Run to your mother.

193
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:08,315
What?

194
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:10,195
Now.

195
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:02,815
Mehmed will punish all the transylvania
for what you've done.

196
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:07,295
It's not a child's place
to save his country.

197
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:10,075
Get my family to the castle.

198
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:12,535
Mehmed will be sending others soon enough.

199
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:16,755
War will come,
You can't protect us.

200
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:20,635
I'll find a way.

201
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,295
Vlad, where are you going?

202
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,275
Whatever horror in Broken Tooth.
I know it kills Turks.

203
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,875
I assume no one has ever had
the privilege of leave either.

204
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,931
Those are meant to reek of fear.

205
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:37,715
In you... I sense hope.

206
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,350
Your silver offends me,
from my sight.

207
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:57,150
What kind of man crawled into his
own grave in search of hope.

208
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,770
A desperate one.

209
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,750
The Turks threaten to destroy my kingdom.

210
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,950
Power like yours. I could stop them.

211
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,830
Save my people. Save my family.

212
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,310
How supremely noble, Lord Impaler.

213
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,190
How is Dracula, son of the devil?

214
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,490
You are mistaken.

215
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,750
It means 'Son of the dragon,
protector of the innocent'.

216
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,550
Do your people how many
innocents you have killed?

217
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,250
Was it... Hundreds?

218
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,950
Yes.

219
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,090
Lie to me again, and I open you
from your belly to your brain.

220
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,490
and feed you your intestines.

221
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,490
Thousands.

222
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,950
And when you put them to the
stake, what did you feel?

223
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,750
Shame, horror, power?

224
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,650
Answer me!

225
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,010
Nothing. I felt nothing.

226
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,470
There is nothing more cruel than that.

227
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,950
Then why spill blood, if not
for the pleasure of it?

228
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,110
Because men do not fear swords.

229
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:14,705
They fear monsters.

230
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:18,524
Run from them. By putting one..

231
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,730
..village to the stake I spare ten more.

232
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:24,975
Sometimes the world no longer needs a hero.

233
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:29,235
Sometimes what it
needs is a monster.

234
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:33,935
And you believe you know
what it is you be a monster?

235
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,655
You have no idea.

236
00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:10,355
But I am going to show you.

237
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:15,375
For centuries these mouldering
walls have been my gallows.

238
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:19,435
Now I'm bound to this cave,
condemned by one who turned me.

239
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:23,975
Oh, I've waited an eternity
for a man of your strength.

240
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:28,595
Your gifts, your will.
A man, worthy of the dark.

241
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,355
and all it's powers.

242
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:36,235
For if I am your
salvation, you are mine.

243
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:49,295
Drink, you will have a
taste of my power.

244
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:51,515
The strength of a 100 men.

245
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,195
The speed of a falling star.
Predominant on the night.

246
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:59,595
And all it's creatures to see
and hear through their senses.

247
00:28:03,735 --> 00:28:06,095
Even heal gravest wounds.

248
00:28:06,095 --> 00:28:07,115
At what price?

249
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:12,535
Once you drink your thirst for
human blood will be insatiable.

250
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:18,006
But if you can resist for tree days.

251
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:22,135
You'll return to your mortal state.
Having sampled my power.

252
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:24,135
And perhaps saved your people.

253
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:25,775
And if I feed?

254
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:30,075
The price will be worse than if
you'd never stepped in here.

255
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:35,615
Well, I will be set free, having granted
the darkness a worthy offering.

256
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:38,395
You will become it's vessel, as I am.

257
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:42,655
A scourge on this Earth.
Destined to destroy.

258
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:48,135
Everything you hold dear, your lands, your
people, even your precious wife and son.

259
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,135
I would die before I harm them.

260
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:51,955
Indeed you will, I'm afraid.

261
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:55,135
I however would last be free to unleash..

262
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:57,975
my wrath against the one who betrayed me.

263
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:02,315
And one day I will call on
you to serve me, my pawn.

264
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:05,455
Ending the mortal game of revenge.

265
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,015
This is not a game!

266
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:09,955
Won't better way to endure the eternity?

267
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:13,575
This little prince is the ultimate game.

268
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:16,875
Light verses dark.

269
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,335
Hope verses despair.

270
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:24,555
And all the word's fate hangs in balance.

271
00:29:25,235 --> 00:29:28,175
And it will be my great
pleasure to disappoint you.

272
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:30,175
Drink.

273
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:37,235
Let the games begin.

274
00:30:02,315 --> 00:30:03,675
What now?

275
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:05,675
Now...

276
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:09,675
You die.

277
00:30:31,355 --> 00:30:32,315
Papa!

278
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:13,115
Just a small scars.

279
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,315
Fire!

280
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:30,375
You came back.

281
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,235
I always will.

282
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:35,155
Where were you?

283
00:33:35,155 --> 00:33:37,155
Searching for the strength I needed.

284
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:38,635
You're back.

285
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
They want our children!

286
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:58,265
A good Prince would
had given them up!

287
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,265
A good Prince would have
paid that price for peace.

288
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:08,745
But I give you my word.
We will not be defeated.

289
00:34:09,745 --> 00:34:15,225
They brought war to our land,
and they will pay dearly for it.

290
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:16,449
Fire!

291
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,495
Negotiation's failed.

292
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,875
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight,

293
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:55,375
Trust only thar I use all
I have to keep us safe.

294
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,135
But we will not be safe if we stay here!

295
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:04,375
We must leave directly to the Casio
Monestre. It's high in the mountains.

296
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:06,375
Too remort for Cannon fire.

297
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:09,535
It's our best chance of survival.

298
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:13,935
We'll take a half of our people, it's
not that our absence is noticed.

299
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,712
That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here.

300
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:20,160
He'll come hunting for us.

301
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,595
Vlad from Castle Dracula.

302
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:25,355
Vlad has defeated a 1000 of our men.

303
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:30,355
Then send a 100,000.
I will lead them.

304
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:35,475
When I march into Europe, I will
have his head upon my spear.

305
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:38,595
And his child? At my side.

306
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,355
We can fight the way our
great grandfathers fought.

307
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:46,795
Use the forests, the mountains
around the Burgo Pass.

308
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:49,615
Four or five months of that.

309
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:53,105
Not months. I'm gonna win
this war in three days.

310
00:38:54,695 --> 00:38:57,595
Why not two?
That really impresses.

311
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,355
What is it?

312
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,830
I need some air.

313
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,970
I'm sorry.

314
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,710
Don't think I haven't
noticed you following me.

315
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:06,570
You're mistaken. I follow them.
They recognize one of their own.

316
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:13,610
The night is their kingdom,
blood is their sustenance.

317
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:19,830
And some may say have lived for as long
as there have been prey to devour.

318
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,110
Spare me your reevings.

319
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,118
They say the one who escaped the mountains,

320
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:30,055
hides behind the
face of a man.

321
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:37,570
Well if that man is me, you know
your knife will not do you any good.

322
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:43,630
Of course not.
Why do you think I stayed?

323
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:53,750
I know there's only so far on this earth
they can run.

324
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,730
And it is not far enough.

325
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,510
Let me serve you.

326
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,590
Stay away from me.

327
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,420
Yes, Master.

328
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:09,465
We found him in the field.
He asked for you.

329
00:43:13,065 --> 00:43:18,955
A message from Prince Vlad.
He hopes you enjoy the view.

330
00:44:09,585 --> 00:44:11,755
Your scars are gone?

331
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,865
What's happening to you?

332
00:44:24,555 --> 00:44:28,035
I meet what men fear in broken tooth.

333
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:32,495
Not a ghost, something else.

334
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:47,605
No! Stop it! May God strike down
whoever did this to you.

335
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:50,305
I chose this.

336
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:55,115
This is the strength you sought?

337
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,195
But why?

338
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:07,285
Because I sent corpses back to
mehmed, instead of our son.

339
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:09,815
You did this for us?

340
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,295
In two days I'll be restored.

341
00:45:13,915 --> 00:45:16,085
I just have to resist.

342
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,365
Resist what?

343
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:25,965
Resist what, vlad?
Tell me.

344
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:31,115
Thirst for blood.

345
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,885
And if you were to give in?

346
00:45:40,095 --> 00:45:42,365
Then I become this for eternity.

347
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:50,425
You will not do this, won't you?

348
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:52,025
Yes.

349
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:56,145
I swear, I will not give in.

350
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,945
So God will forgive you.

351
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:04,595
Vlad! Mehmed is getting closer.
You might want to move out soon.

352
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:07,815
I need you to get to the monastery
as quickly as you can.

353
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:09,885
Mehmed's men will
be close behind.

354
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:11,245
-No!
-Listen to me.

355
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:13,145
I will reach you after sundown.

356
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,745
I promise you.

357
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:24,765
I love you.

358
00:46:39,015 --> 00:46:41,245
My husband agrees with your council.

359
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:44,975
We will depart now, under
your temporary command.

360
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:47,094
What? Where is Vlad going to be?

361
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:49,715
Spying on the Turks.

362
00:46:50,455 --> 00:46:52,795
He insists on doing a reconnaissance.

363
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,285
No. I won't allow it.

364
00:46:54,285 --> 00:46:57,655
It's too late. He's already gone.

365
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:04,345
All right, everyone.
Prepare to move out!

366
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:24,225
Tell the Sultan where his
enemies will be buried.

367
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,065
Listen.

368
00:47:55,485 --> 00:47:57,715
We are nearly there.

369
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:17,195
Cover the rear.

370
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:53,945
Couldn't these monks put the gate
a little bit closer?!

371
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,510
Stay behind me.

372
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:31,680
Didn't the Turks teach you anything,
I saw your blade coming from..

373
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,940
Ingeras, run!

374
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,940
Where is your Prince now?

375
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,630
My Lady..

376
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,630
Dimitru
It's ok.

377
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,340
It's ok.

378
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,400
Vlad.

379
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,650
Dimitru listen. Listen!

380
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,110
No.

381
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,170
Come here.

382
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,030
Never leave us again, Papa.

383
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,030
Never.
I will always watch over you.

384
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,400
To the gate!!

385
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,030
Keep moving on!

386
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,600
This way!

387
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,910
You should never've
straight from us!

388
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,510
Whatever you reason.

389
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,410
Quiet.

390
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:47,250
Get these men off their knees.
Stand up, you hear me stand up.

391
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,330
The turks are coming! Prayers
will not defend these walls!

392
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,080
Do you believe we can do this?

393
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,510
Mehmet's men will be
coming from the north.

394
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:08,310
Double the guards of the fort.
Go, do it now!

395
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,600
What's in there?

396
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,030
Something I hope to never use it again.

397
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,570
Come now.

398
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:31,850
The men say that vlad has become a monster.

399
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:36,030
They fear this will only inflect the
rumors of the prince' dark magic.

400
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,030
Only we allow it.

401
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,200
Men can not fear what
they can not see!

402
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,510
Remember when you
first join my army!

403
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,000
You wanted to pick up
your sword and fight!

404
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:00,250
When my generals blindfolded you,

405
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,510
You did not believed that you
could march without seeing.

406
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,030
But you could.

407
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:14,770
Now march with me!
Your sultan will guide you!

408
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:19,430
Prince vlad, the vampire
is vulnerable to daylight.

409
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,320
And to pure silver.

410
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,030
Yet the holy cross has
no power over you.

411
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,920
That can only mean you have yet to
seal your fate with human blood.

412
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,460
Let me kill you now, my Prince.
Please!

413
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,200
Before your people do. Rumor has
spread of what you have become.

414
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,950
You can still repent.

415
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,320
You do will to run, Lucien.

416
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:13,720
He's a vampire.

417
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,520
No!

418
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:23,550
Listen! He is your Prince!
Please give him a chance to explain!

419
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:27,830
-Stop, please!
-Kill the monster!

420
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,750
Satan lives in his heart!

421
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,950
Vlad...

422
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,320
Try to save his soul.

423
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,550
Take him to my room and shut the door.

424
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,550
Do not let him not look outside.

425
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,550
Mama!

426
00:56:44,085 --> 00:56:46,885
This is your loyalty?

427
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:48,885
Your gratitude?

428
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:55,685
Fools. Do you think you're
alive because you can fight?

429
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:01,915
You are alive because of me!

430
00:57:05,345 --> 00:57:08,485
Because of what I did to save you!

431
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:18,485
This is not who you are.

432
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:36,775
Return to your stations.

433
00:57:37,805 --> 00:57:42,035
Believe me, there is
still more to fear!

434
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:53,575
Lord, if you've not yet forsaken me
that I may resist the darkness.

435
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,280
Allow me to endure this
test one more day.

436
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,190
I beg you.

437
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,680
Please.

438
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,360
Are you sick?

439
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,880
If you are sick, thought
this make you feel better.

440
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,110
Thank you. Come.

441
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,730
You'll make a great
leader some day.

442
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,330
You think of others before yourself.

443
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:02,960
When the Turks came to take me...
you stopped them.

444
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,890
That's why you got sick, isn't it?

445
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,890
To save me?

446
00:59:08,914 --> 00:59:10,914
Yes.

447
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,860
And I would do it all again.

448
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,350
They're almost here.

449
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:58,490
Sun will be breaking soon
and with it the last of my powers.

450
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,380
If we've not won this war by then.

451
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,380
I will fight beside you until death.

452
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,660
Your death would end my fight.

453
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:12,030
We have done the duty of any good parent.
Protected our child.

454
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,030
Protected all the children in the kingdom.

455
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,430
Perhaps our destiny was
not to rule in this life.

456
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:23,230
Do you remember our wedding vow?

457
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,380
Why thinks separately if
this life and the next.

458
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,380
When one is born from the the last.

459
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,150
Time is always too short
for those who need it.

460
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,559
But those who love,

461
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:40,055
love forever.

462
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,320
Stand your position!

463
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,680
Stand your position!

464
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:51,180
Fire!

465
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,720
Mehmed!

466
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,010
Where is he?

467
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,010
Where is he!

468
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,010
Fire!

469
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,830
Find your father, go!

470
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:00,420
Where is he?

471
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,660
You can keep running,
if you like.

472
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:21,580
Mama!

473
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,490
Let me go! No!

474
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,290
Mirena!

475
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,980
No, please!

476
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:35,750
Ingeras!

477
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,810
No!

478
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,460
No!

479
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,460
No!!

480
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:57,260
Please stay with me.

481
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,260
I can not do this without you.

482
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,920
Mirena!

483
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,790
There's still time for you to stop them.

484
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,730
Drink my blood.

485
01:07:32,585 --> 01:07:37,165
No! I can not take your life.

486
01:07:38,075 --> 01:07:39,965
My life is lost already.

487
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:43,765
But our son is not.

488
01:07:43,785 --> 01:07:44,985
No!

489
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,390
I love you.

490
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,960
Do it now.

491
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,900
Please.

492
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,360
Do it now.

493
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:32,270
Do you want vengeance?

494
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,500
Drink.

495
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,960
I now know hell is real.

496
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,160
So I know there's a heaven.

497
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:34,390
Neither this world nor the
next shall keep us apart.

498
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,390
I will honor your sacrifice and I
vow that our son shall be safe.

499
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:53,190
Of all my lands, this is
the one I love the least.

500
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,820
Look to the east. The sun should
be up by now but it's not.

501
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,530
What is that?

502
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:21,760
It is the prince the prince.
He's coming.

503
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:12,220
I used to think there
were too many of you.

504
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,020
Now this not enough.

505
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:14,960
I understand you
have a weakness.

506
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,820
Pure silver.

507
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,790
Papa!

508
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:33,300
He's waiting for you

509
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,900
You're slower, brother, and the weaker.

510
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,970
Go on, take it!

511
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:31,240
Is this the monster
that terrified my men?

512
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,070
You grow more weary by the moment.

513
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:43,360
Tell me, how long can
you bear it in here?

514
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:48,900
Long enough to strike your name
from the history books.

515
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,500
Papa!

516
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:35,460
Look at your father Ingeras.
Look how pathetic he is.

517
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,460
Stop! please!

518
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,070
If I put the stake
through your heart..

519
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:51,760
It will kill you.

520
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:54,730
Like any other man.

521
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,640
A fitting death,

522
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,640
for Lord..

523
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,640
Impaler..

524
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,500
Papa!

525
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,360
That is no longer my name.

526
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,160
My name is Dracula.

527
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,470
Son of the Devil.

528
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:19,040
It's all right,
I'm here.

529
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:52,240
- You old goat.
- I don't feel old.

530
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,340
How many are left?

531
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:59,260
None... except for your son.
Of course.

532
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:03,540
A distraction we can now... dispense.

533
01:18:09,295 --> 01:18:11,065
What have I told you?

534
01:18:11,755 --> 01:18:16,665
Repeated, over and over,
since you were a boy?

535
01:18:17,635 --> 01:18:21,235
All that matters is that
prince's duty to his people.

536
01:18:22,205 --> 01:18:24,095
Don't you realize?

537
01:18:25,185 --> 01:18:27,185
They are all our enemy now.

538
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:31,585
When he's gone, you'll be free.

539
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:43,125
You forget who I am?

540
01:19:20,435 --> 01:19:22,665
Leave him.

541
01:19:28,605 --> 01:19:31,295
Come with me, child.

542
01:19:34,325 --> 01:19:35,635
Please.

543
01:19:35,925 --> 01:19:37,865
Reverse!

544
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:43,355
It has to stop.
Please!

545
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:48,155
I don't want to leave you.

546
01:19:48,495 --> 01:19:51,565
-You have to go with him.
-No!

547
01:19:51,585 --> 01:19:53,585
Do not leave his side.

548
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:55,585
No!

549
01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:59,355
I will always love you.

550
01:19:59,695 --> 01:20:01,095
Always.

551
01:20:05,295 --> 01:20:06,425
Go!

552
01:20:06,485 --> 01:20:07,635
No!
Please.

553
01:20:08,495 --> 01:20:09,635
Go.

554
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:11,525
No!

555
01:20:11,805 --> 01:20:13,635
You take care of him.

556
01:20:15,235 --> 01:20:18,205
No!
Papa!

557
01:20:18,785 --> 01:20:19,585
No!

558
01:20:20,035 --> 01:20:21,635
No!

559
01:20:32,955 --> 01:20:35,635
He's safe now Mirena.

560
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:01,925
The Turks never conquered
the capitals of Europe.

561
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:11,235
Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.

562
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:19,065
But there are no pictures
or statues of him.

563
01:22:23,695 --> 01:22:26,095
I.. am his legacy.

564
01:22:27,865 --> 01:22:32,095
His sacrifice taught me,
that even after the darkest night.

565
01:22:32,555 --> 01:22:34,605
The sun will rise again.

566
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:37,185
Drink, master.

567
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:44,725
If the heart is strong enough,
the soul is reborn.

568
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:50,000
With each new day.

569
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,035
In life after life.

570
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,895
Age after age.

571
01:23:02,555 --> 01:23:04,555
Forever.

572
01:23:30,155 --> 01:23:32,035
Beautiful.

573
01:23:34,895 --> 01:23:37,005
The flowers, my lady.

574
01:23:37,881 --> 01:23:39,481
My lady?

575
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,801
Where are you from?

576
01:23:42,801 --> 01:23:44,801
Far away from here.

577
01:23:51,081 --> 01:23:53,311
Well, good night.

578
01:23:53,881 --> 01:23:56,681
I think separate of this life and the next.

579
01:23:57,201 --> 01:23:59,201
When one is born of the last.

580
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,541
It's my favorite poem.

581
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:13,251
It speaks to you of yearning.
Of one soul pleading for another.

582
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:18,681
I am mina.

583
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:23,771
Vlad.

584
01:24:57,651 --> 01:24:59,771
Let the games begin.

585
01:25:00,091 --> 01:25:10,091
