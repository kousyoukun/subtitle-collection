1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:55,303


2
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,401
<i>In the year of our Lord, 1442,

3
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,233
<i>the Turkish sultan enslaved
1,000 Transylvanian boys

4
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,401
<i>to fill the ranks of his army.

5
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:14,371
<i>These child slaves were
beaten without mercy,

6
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,167
<i>trained to kill
without conscience,

7
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:25,007
<i>to crave the blood
of all who defied the Turks.

8
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,803
<i>From among these boys,

9
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,480
<i>one grew into a warrior
so fierce

10
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,685
<i>that entire armies
would retreat in terror

11
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,519
<i>at the mention of his name.

12
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,195
<i>Vlad the Impaler.

13
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,571
<i>Son of the Dragon.

14
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,159
<i>Sickened by his monstrous acts,

15
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,121
<i>Vlad came to bury
his past with the dead

16
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,958
<i>and returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.

17
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,885
<i>His subjects called him Prince.

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,134
<i>I called him Father.

19
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,966
<i>But the world would come
to know him</i> as...

20
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,685
Dracula.

21
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,867
I left it

22
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,658
where I found it.

23
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,709
What do you think, Vlad?

24
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,051
Bring it to me.

25
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,932
This belongs to a scout.

26
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,568
One of Hamza Bey's men.

27
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,070
What the hell's a lone
Turk doing out here?

28
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,441
Turkish scouts never
travel alone.

29
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,325
If there's one, there's more.

30
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,240
And whatever they scout,

31
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,037
they conquer.

32
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,172
This was washed downstream.

33
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,008
Came from up there.

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,056
Broken Tooth Mountain.

35
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,176
Soon it will be night.

36
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,186
They'll seek refuge.

37
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,857
Dimitru, I need you
to return to the castle.

38
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,525
Alert the guards
and double the sentry.

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,523
What? I'm not leaving you here.

40
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,229
For the Turks to cross
into my land unannounced

41
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,359
is a sign of war.

42
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,066
And what are you going
to do if you find them?

43
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,072
I'll do what princes do best.

44
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,528
Negotiate.

45
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,240
Nicolae, Andrei, with me.

46
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,955
Fall in!

47
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,982
Anything?

48
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,248
Smells like your feet.

49
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,634
They're inside.

50
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,018
How do you know?

51
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,225
Bats don't come
out during the day.

52
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,355
Something's disturbed them.

53
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,853
Come on.

54
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,405
What is it, My Lord?

55
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,366
The floor.

56
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,248
It's crushed bone.

57
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,997
The Turks didn't do this.

58
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,006
What's that?

59
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,638
We leave, now.

60
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,250
The creature you encountered

61
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,378
was no accident, My Prince.

62
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,793
Four nights ago,
every brother in our order

63
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,504
awoke from an identical dream.

64
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,923
I would not have
thought it possible

65
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:48,055
had I not suffered the same
vision myself that night.

66
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,147
Of a creature laying siege
to this holy place.

67
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,737
The Roman mystics prophesied
the coming of a great evil.

68
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,193
A vampire.

69
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:07,572
From the Greek
word pi, to drink.

70
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,790
The beast was once a mortal man

71
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,709
who summoned a demon
from the depths of hell

72
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,254
<i>to trade for his dark power.

73
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,547
<i>The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish,

74
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,377
<i>but his price was an eternity

75
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,804
<i>condemned to the darkness
of that cave,

76
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,433
<i>where he remains
until he finds another

77
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,679
<i>to set him free.

78
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,977
Now you know its true face.

79
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,433
The people of Transylvania

80
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,066
live in enough fear
of the Turks' return.

81
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,362
Promise me you'll guard
this secret, brother.

82
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,037
Papa!

83
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,169
I missed you.

84
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,878
And I, you.

85
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,796
My big soldier.

86
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,306
What? An embrace but no kiss?

87
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,557
Are we going to argue?

88
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,264
With you always leaving,
I need my fill.

89
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,147
I've missed you.

90
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,523
Something troubles you.
What is it?

91
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,570
Only the impossible
depth of your beauty.

92
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,698
Puts the rest
of the world to shame.

93
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,659
Pay no attention
to your father, ingeras.

94
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,953
Flattery is a cheap
distraction from truth.

95
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,792
She knows all my tricks.

96
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,714
You're a terrible liar.

97
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,168
It's one of your most endearing
qualities.

98
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,337
You're just in time for bed.

99
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,313
Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?

100
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,514
Of course we can.

101
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,770
You most certainly cannot.

102
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,941
Why not?

103
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,019
Because tomorrow is the day
of our risen Lord.

104
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,441
Oh, of course.

105
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,522
That's Easter.

106
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,108
What was I thinking?

107
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,873
So what attacked you?

108
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,543
Wolves?

109
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,629
I suppose.

110
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,049
All I know is that I've lost
two good men today.

111
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,325
There's something more.

112
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,288
I was the same age <i>as</i> ingeras

113
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,957
when I was sent to live
with the Turks.

114
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,290
To fight for them.

115
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,175
If I never saw another,
it would be too soon.

116
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,968
You're home now.

117
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,720
For almost as many years
<i>as</i> you were gone.

118
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,185
I just want peace.

119
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,608
That's all.

120
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,254
My fellow Transylvanians,

121
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,177
an Easter toast.

122
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,135
Ten years of peace
and prosperity

123
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,345
ever since our prince
came back to us.

124
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,389
My old friend,
here's to 20 more.

125
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,221
To 20 more!

126
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,419
Mmm.

127
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,007
Hamza Bey.

128
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,880
Welcome.

129
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,140
We were not expecting
you so soon.

130
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,304
Sultan Mehmed ll offers
his salutations to you and your son.

131
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,388
Thank him.

132
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,974
I have his tribute ready.

133
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:50,937
Hmm.

134
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,444
I'm afraid

135
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,735
there's something more
than a tribute to discuss.

136
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,653
The Turks have no enemies here.

137
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,367
Did you think
we would not notice

138
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,665
a battalion
of our scouts missing?

139
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,872
I did not kill them.

140
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,423
It still lives inside you,
Lord Impaler.

141
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,552
Locked in a dark
cage, hidden away.

142
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,388
But you and I...
we both know it's there.

143
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,973
The sultan's tribute.

144
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,609
Take it and leave.

145
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,193
Ah!

146
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,200
There is one last thing.

147
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,168
The sultan requires 1,000 boys

148
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,745
to join his Janissary Corps.

149
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,049
No! Never!

150
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,133
Janissaries?

151
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,466
He ended that practice
years ago.

152
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,470
When a soldier
is plucked <i>as</i> a child

153
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,135
and raised to know
no other life,

154
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,352
they will kill without question
and die without complaint.

155
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,112
Any who are 15 years of age
or older will fight in Hungary.

156
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,825
Those 10 to 14 will be made
ready for the siege on Vienna.

157
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,578
The sultan expects
your obedience.

158
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,493
After all,

159
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,621
did not your own father give
you up without a fight?

160
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,757
Soft, but they'll do.

161
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,548
Don't. Please.

162
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,050
Do you know who I am?

163
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,637
You mean who you were.

164
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,230
You have no army
and no choice, Prince.

165
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,276
Follow our command,
or suffer the consequences.

166
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,876
It must be done.

167
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,462
Courage, anger, even love.

168
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,757
None of these can
matter to a prince.

169
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,260
All that matters
is his duty to his people.

170
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,805
What does it mean to be
a royal hostage?

171
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,438
My father gave me to the sultan
to prove his loyalty.

172
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,932
Were you scared there?

173
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,683
With them?

174
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,645
I wanted to make
my father proud.

175
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,156
Would you ever give
me to the sultan?

176
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,782
That was a long time ago.

177
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,708
You have nothing to worry about.

178
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,707
Do you understand?

179
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,123
Good.

180
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,274
<i>If I defy the order, they'll kill
100 for every one I save.

181
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,070
You told me you and Mehmed
were once like brothers.

182
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,239
Were you to ask,

183
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,827
isn't it possible he might
show you some mercy?

184
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,595
You ever seen the like of it?

185
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,897
Soon the entire
world will be Turk.

186
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,491
Lord Impaler,

187
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,333
my oldest of friends.

188
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,214
I miss our days together.

189
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,627
All I miss from my time
with you is the coffee.

190
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,220
It's true, my father's palace
was a cruel place

191
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,093
for a young boy far from home.

192
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,509
But soon you talked like us,

193
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,344
prayed like us, fought like us.

194
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,938
Speaking of which,
I am owed 1,000 boys.

195
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,233
Why have I not seen them?

196
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,565
Mehmed, my brother,

197
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,901
I will Grant you anything else.

198
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,657
I need soldiers,

199
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:52,947
brother.

200
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,331
Then take me.

201
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,297
I'm worth 1,000 boys,
and you know it.

202
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,595
Those kings would tremble
if they knew.

203
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,422
Then accept my offer.

204
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,726
When we were boys, how I longed
to fight side by side.

205
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,271
But now I am sultan, what need
have I for one more soldier?

206
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,690
I will have my 1,000 boys.

207
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,234
And one more.

208
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,195
<i>Your son will be
raised under my roof,

209
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,782
<i>just as you were raised
under the roof of my father.

210
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,367
You may retain your throne.

211
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,785
But General Ismail will remain
to see that my orders are fulfilled.

212
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,378
Please. Do not do this.

213
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,123
What is one son?

214
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,170
If you are virile,
you'll make plenty more.

215
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,311
Whoa, there.

216
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,833
You promised me this
would never happen.

217
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:24,914
Mirena, listen.

218
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,169
The day you asked for my hand,

219
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,545
do you remember what I said?

220
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,089
You said no.

221
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,218
Stay, my young friend.

222
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,638
I knew what happens
to the sons of the queen.

223
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,886
You said things
would be different.

224
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,218
You said if I loved you,
I should trust you.

225
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,765
I love you!

226
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,687
Then trust me. It's this
or we start a war.

227
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,483
The Great Impaler can't
please his woman.

228
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,525
Everything's fine, boys.

229
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,727
They're just saying
their goodbyes is all.

230
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,279
Mirena. I won't let you...

231
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,482
You promised me my family!
Mirena, please!

232
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,157
Stop it! Don't touch me!

233
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,112
I won't! I won't
let them do this!

234
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,201
Vlad, don't! Don't do this!

235
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,827
No! No!

236
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,250
No, I won't let you do this!
I'll go.

237
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,457
I won't! No! I'll go!

238
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,556
I can do it.

239
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,432
You're proud of me, aren't you?

240
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,980
Of course I am.

241
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,999
You have chosen wisely.

242
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,871
Yeah, I have to say,
we are a little disappointed.

243
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,047
Frankly, I expected more

244
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,925
resistance from you.

245
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,019
Run to your mother.

246
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,266
What?

247
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,684
Now!

248
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Come here!

249
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,069
Don't look!

250
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,243
Mehmed will punish all of Transylvania
for what you have done.

251
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,909
It's not a child's place
to save his country.

252
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,874
Get my family to the castle.

253
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,748
Mehmed will be sending
others soon enough.

254
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,587
War will come.

255
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,085
You can't protect us.

256
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,013
I'll find a way.

257
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,092
Vlad! Where are you going?

258
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,184
Whatever haunts Broken Tooth,
I know it kills Turks.

259
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,455
You returned.

260
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,332
No one has ever returned.

261
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,308
It seems no one has ever had
the privilege of leaving, either.

262
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,430
Neither will you.

263
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,347
Those whom enter reek of fear.

264
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,312
In you.

265
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,226
I sense hope.

266
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,577
Your silver offends me.
Cloak it from my sight.

267
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,501
What kind of man crawls
into his own grave

268
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,499
in search of hope? Hmm?

269
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,547
A desperate one.

270
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,422
The Turks threaten
to destroy my kingdom.

271
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:06,597
With power like yours,
I could stop them,

272
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,185
save my people, save my family.

273
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,764
How supremely noble,
Lord Impaler.

274
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,851
House Dracul, Son of the Devil.

275
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,194
You're mistaken.

276
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,690
It means "son of the dragon."

277
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,116
"Protector of the innocent."

278
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,361
Do your people know

279
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,165
how many innocents
you have killed?

280
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,367
Was it hundreds?

281
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,411
Yes.

282
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,421
Lie to me again

283
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,844
and I'll open you
from your belly to your brain

284
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,138
and feed you your intestines.

285
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,465
Thousands.

286
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,555
And when you put them
to the stake, what did you feel?

287
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,641
Shame? Horror?

288
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,472
Power?

289
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,978
Answer me!

290
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,605
Nothing!

291
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,361
I felt nothing.

292
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,438
A greater crime
than the act itself.

293
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,114
Then why spill blood

294
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,067
if not for the pleasure of it?

295
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,404
Because men do not fear swords.

296
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,664
They fear monsters.

297
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,580
They run from them.

298
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,335
By putting one village
to the stake,

299
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,333
I spared 10 more.

300
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,292
Sometimes the world no
longer needs a hero.

301
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,090
Sometimes what it needs

302
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,341
is a monster.

303
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,384
And you believe you know

304
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,092
what it is to be a monster? Hmm?

305
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,213
You have no idea.

306
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,218
But I'm going to show you.

307
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,384
For centuries, these moldering
walls have been my gallows.

308
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,059
For I'm bound to this cave,

309
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,354
condemned by one who turned me.

310
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,432
Oh, and I have
waited an eternity

311
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,892
for a man of your strength,

312
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,527
your gifts, your will.

313
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,407
A man worthy of the dark
and all its powers.

314
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,903
For if I am your salvation,

315
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,366
you are mine.

316
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,998
Drink.

317
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,083
You will have a taste
of my power.

318
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,837
The strength of 100 men.

319
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,796
The speed of a falling star.

320
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,929
Dominion over the night
and all its creatures.

321
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,433
To see and hear
through their senses.

322
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,933
Even heal grievous wounds.

323
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,269
At what price?

324
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,024
Once you drink,

325
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,855
your thirst for human blood

326
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,690
will be insatiable.

327
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,034
But if you can resist
for three days,

328
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,369
you will return
to your mortal state

329
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,121
having sampled my power,

330
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,123
and perhaps, saved your people.

331
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,962
And if I feed?

332
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,380
The price would be worse than

333
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,378
if you'd never stepped in here.

334
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,423
For I will be set free.

335
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,637
Having granted the darkness
a worthy offering.

336
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,762
You will become its
vessel as I am.

337
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,677
A scourge on this earth

338
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,889
destined to destroy
everything you hold dear.

339
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,769
Your lands, your people,

340
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,146
even your precious wife and son.

341
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,110
I would die
before I harmed them.

342
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,314
Indeed you will, I'm afraid.

343
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,657
I, however, will at last be free

344
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,111
to unleash my wrath
against the one who betrayed me.

345
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:01,165
And one day, I will call
on you to serve me, my pawn,

346
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,376
in an immortal game of revenge.

347
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,623
This is not a game!

348
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,831
Ah, but what better way
to endure eternity?

349
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:13,002
For this, little prince,
is the ultimate game.

350
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,297
Light versus dark,

351
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,633
hope versus despair.

352
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:23,266
And all the world's fate
hangs in the balance.

353
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,056
Then it will be
my great pleasure

354
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,186
to disappoint you.

355
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,351
Drink.

356
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,442
Let the games begin.

357
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,635
What now?

358
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,137
Now,

359
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,390
you die.

360
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:31,747
<i>Papa!

361
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,788
That's useful.

362
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,903
Prepare to fire!

363
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,732
Light!

364
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,883
You came back.

365
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,597
I always will.

366
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,354
Where were you?

367
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,732
Searching for the strength
I needed.

368
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,267
You're back!

369
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,911
They wanted our sons!

370
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,991
We can't fight.

371
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,624
A good prince would have
given them up.

372
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,498
A good prince would have
paid that price for peace.

373
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,052
But I give you my word,

374
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,221
we will not be defeated!

375
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,469
They've brought war to our land.

376
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,644
And they will pay dearly for it.

377
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,646
Fire!

378
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,786
Charge!

379
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,004
What? Wait.

380
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,309
Negotiations failed.

381
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,524
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight.

382
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,940
Trust only that I will use
all I have to keep us safe.

383
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,401
But we will not be
safe if we stay here.

384
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,655
<i>We must leave directly
for Cozia Monastery.

385
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,576
<i>It's high in the mountains,
too remote for Cannon fire.

386
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,953
<i>It's our best
chance of survival.

387
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,278
<i>We'll take enough of our people

388
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,915
<i>so that our absence is noticed.

389
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,553
<i>That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here,

390
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,264
<i>he will come hunting for us.

391
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,220
Word from Castle Dracula.

392
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,386
Vlad has defeated
1,000 of our men.

393
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,266
Then send 100,000.
I will lead them.

394
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,902
When I march into Europe,

395
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,859
I will have his head
upon my spear

396
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,865
and his child at my side.

397
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,028
We can fight the way
our great-grandfathers fought.

398
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,332
Use the forests, the mountains
around the Borgo Pass.

399
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,571
Four or five months of that.

400
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,747
Not months.

401
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,289
I'm gonna win this
war in three days.

402
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,881
Why not two? That'd really
impress us.

403
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,169
Feed.

404
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,223
What is it?

405
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,015
I need some air.

406
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,233
I'm sorry.

407
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,168
Don't think I haven't
noticed you following me.

408
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,424
You're mistaken.

409
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,377
I follow them.

410
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,881
They recognize one of their own.

411
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,392
The night is their kingdom.

412
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,933
Blood, their sustenance.

413
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,730
And some, they say,

414
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,894
have lived for <i>as</i> long <i>as</i> there
have been prey to devour.

415
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,062
Spare me your ravings.

416
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,117
They say the one who escaped
the mountain

417
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,412
hides behind the face of a man.

418
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,874
Well, if that man is me,

419
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,210
you'll know a knife
will not do you any good.

420
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,042
Of course not.

421
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,255
Why do you think I stayed?

422
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:53,304
I know there is only so far
on this earth we can run,

423
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,688
and it is not far enough.

424
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,234
Let me serve you.

425
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,128
Stay away from me.

426
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,799
Yes, master.

427
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,982
<i>Fulfill your destiny.

428
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,651
<i>Set me free.

429
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,336
We found him in the field.
He asked for you.

430
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,850
A message from Prince Vlad.

431
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,855
He hopes you enjoy the view.

432
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,063
Mirena!

433
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,740
Your scars are gone.

434
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,862
What's happening to you?

435
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,630
I'm the thing men
fear on Broken Tooth.

436
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,875
Not a ghost.

437
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,386
Something else.

438
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,514
No! Stop it!

439
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,477
May God strike
down whoever did this to you.

440
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,107
I chose this.

441
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,574
This is the strength you sought?

442
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,737
But why?

443
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,700
Because I sent corpses

444
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,125
back to Mehmed

445
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,794
instead of our son.

446
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,961
You did this for us?

447
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,000
In two days, I'll be restored.

448
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,966
I just have to resist.

449
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,470
Resist what?

450
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,305
Resist what, Vlad? Tell me!

451
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,479
A thirst

452
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,273
for blood.

453
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,451
And if you were to give in?

454
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,118
Then I become this for eternity.

455
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,671
You will undo this, won't you'?

456
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,498
Yes.

457
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,417
I swear it.

458
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,218
I will not give in.

459
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,672
Then God will forgive you.

460
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,223
Vlad.

461
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,759
Mehmed is getting closer.

462
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,515
We might want to move out soon.

463
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,165
I need you to get
to the monastery

464
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,181
<i>as</i> quickly as you can.

465
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,313
Mehmed's men will be close by.
No.

466
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,564
Listen to me.

467
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,737
I will reach you after sundown.

468
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,485
I promise you.

469
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,198
I love you.

470
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,427
My husband agrees
with your counsel.

471
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,767
We will depart now
under your temporary command.

472
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,349
What? And where's Vlad
going to be?

473
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,397
Spying on the Turks.

474
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,899
He insists on doing
his own reconnaissance.

475
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,818
No. I won't have it.

476
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,395
It's too late.

477
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,405
He's already gone.

478
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:00,739
All right, everyone.

479
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,571
- Prepare to move out.
- Prepare the horses.

480
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,474
Tell the sultan where
his enemies will be buried.

481
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,333
Listen.

482
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,294
We're nearly there.

483
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:15,984
Cover the rear!

484
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,692
Mirena!

485
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,243
Mirena! Lngeras!

486
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:51,895
Couldn't these monks have built

487
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,848
their gates a little bit closer?

488
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,864
Stay behind me.

489
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,093
Don't the Turks teach
you anything new?

490
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,099
I saw your blade coming from...

491
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,022
ingeras, run.

492
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,854
Where is your prince now,

493
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,731
My Lady?

494
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,978
Dimitru.

495
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,431
It's okay.

496
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,979
It's okay.

497
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,148
Vlad.

498
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,691
Dimitru, listen. Listen!

499
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,616
No!

500
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,973
Come here. Come here.

501
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,939
Never leave us again, Papa.

502
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,646
Never.

503
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,813
I will always watch over you.

504
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,157
Through the gates!

505
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,451
Keep moving along! This way!

506
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,111
You should never have
strayed from us,

507
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,642
whatever your reasons
for leaving were...

508
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:36,970
Quiet.

509
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,815
Get these men off their knees.

510
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,609
Stand up, do you hear me?
Stand up!

511
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,358
The Turks are coming!

512
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,692
Prayers will not
defend these walls!

513
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,208
Do you believe we can do this?

514
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,253
Mehmed's men will be
coming from the north.

515
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,880
Double our sentries
on the perimeter walls.

516
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,212
Go. Do it now.

517
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,293
What's in there?

518
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,598
Something I hope
to never use again.

519
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,185
Come now.

520
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,364
The men say that Vlad
has become a monster.

521
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:34,819
I fear this will only inflame
the rumors of the Prince's dark magic.

522
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,745
Only if we allow it.

523
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,958
Men cannot fear
what they cannot see.

524
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,797
Remember when you
first joined my army.

525
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,883
You wanted to pick
up your sword and fight!

526
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,809
When my generals
blindfolded you,

527
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,349
you did not believe

528
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,806
that you could march
without seeing.

529
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,143
But you could.

530
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,071
Now march with me!

531
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,450
Your sultan will guide you!

532
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,377
Prince Vlad,

533
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:18,305
the vampire is vulnerable
to daylight.

534
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,303
And to pure silver.

535
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,688
Yet the holy cross exerts
no power over you.

536
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,447
That can only mean you have yet

537
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,616
to seal your fate
with human blood.

538
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,408
Let me kill you now, My Prince.

539
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,329
Please.

540
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,370
Before your people do.

541
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,206
Rumor has spread
of what you have become.

542
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,713
You can still repent.

543
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,375
You'd do well to run, Lucian.

544
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,057
It's true! He's a monster!

545
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,853
No!

546
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,158
Please! Listen! He
is your prince!

547
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,110
He has earned
the chance to explain.

548
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,195
Stop!

549
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,744
Kill the monster!
He's your prince!

550
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,909
Satan lives in his heart!

551
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,960
Vlad!

552
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,187
Mirena!

553
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,062
He was trying to save us all!

554
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,095
Take him to my room
and shut the door.

555
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,043
Do not let him look outside!

556
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,712
Okay. Mama!

557
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,530
This is your loyalty?

558
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:47,162
Your gratitude?

559
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,622
Fools.

560
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,665
Do you think you are alive
because you can fight?

561
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:54,961
Come on.

562
00:56:56,997 --> 00:57:00,001
You are alive because of me!

563
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,840
Because of what I did
to save you!

564
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,938
This is not who you are.

565
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,497
Return to your stations.

566
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,086
Believe me,

567
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,707
there is still more to fear!

568
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:48,549
Lord, if you've not
yet forsaken me,

569
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,345
Grant me your strength
that I may resist the darkness.

570
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:57,563
Allow me to endure this
test one more day.

571
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,440
I beg you.

572
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,572
Please.

573
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,759
Are you sick?

574
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,214
If you were sick,

575
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,430
I thought it might
make you feel better.

576
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,899
Thank you.

577
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,271
Come.

578
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,574
You'll make a great
leader someday.

579
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,286
You think of others
before yourself.

580
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,998
When the Turks came to take me,

581
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,417
you stopped them.

582
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,085
It's why you got sick, isn't it?

583
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,962
To save me.

584
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,513
Yes.

585
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,927
And I would do it all again.

586
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,508
They're almost here.

587
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,467
Dawn will be breaking soon.

588
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,887
And with it, the loss
of my powers.

589
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,014
If we've not won
this war by then...

590
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,396
I will fight beside you
until death.

591
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,023
Your death would end my fight.

592
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,985
We have done the duty
of any good parent.

593
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,491
Protected our child.

594
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,115
Protected all the children
in the kingdom.

595
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,910
Perhaps our destiny was not
to rule in this life.

596
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,206
Do you remember our wedding vow?

597
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,633
"Why think separately of this
life and the next..."

598
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,709
"When one is born
from the last?"

599
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:31,799
Time is always too short

600
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,721
for those who need it.

601
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,892
But for those who love,

602
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,227
it lasts forever.

603
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,145
No!

604
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,030
Hold your ground!

605
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,483
Stand your ground!

606
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,151
Hold fast!

607
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,244
Hold your ground!

608
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,452
Fire!

609
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,362
Mehmed!

610
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,070
No.

611
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,952
Where is he?

612
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,950
Where is he?

613
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,208
Fire!

614
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,207
Draw!

615
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,291
Fire!

616
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,301
Find your father! Go!

617
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,732
Where is he?

618
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,490
You can keep running
if you like.

619
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,803
Let me go! No!

620
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:26,844
Mirena.

621
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,222
No! Please!

622
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:34,935
Ingeras!

623
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:46,860
No!

624
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,877
Vlad!

625
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,047
No!

626
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,886
No, Mirena.

627
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,848
Please, stay with me.

628
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,150
I cannot do this without you.

629
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,248
Mirena.

630
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,255
There's still time
for you to stop them.

631
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,180
Drink my blood.

632
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,011
No.

633
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,093
I cannot take your life.

634
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,518
My life is lost already.

635
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,900
But our son's is not.

636
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,148
No.

637
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,407
I love you.

638
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,079
Do it now!

639
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,328
Please.

640
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,254
Do it now.

641
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,684
Vlad!

642
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,734
No!

643
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,425
Do you want vengeance?

644
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:42,979
Drink.

645
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:26,309
<i>I now know hell is real.

646
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,976
<i>So I know there's a heaven.

647
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,320
<i>Neither this world
or the next shall keep us apart.

648
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:36,900
<i>I will honor your sacrifice

649
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,782
<i>and I vow that our son
shall be safe.

650
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,210
Of all of my lands,

651
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,418
this is the one I love
the least.

652
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,837
Look to the east.

653
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,932
The sun should be risen
by now, should it not?

654
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,897
What is that?

655
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,366
It is the Prince.

656
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,694
He is coming.

657
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,290
I used to think there
were too many of you.

658
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,208
Now there's not enough.

659
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,099
I understand you have a weakness

660
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,142
for silver.

661
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,907
Papa!

662
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,204
He's waiting for you.

663
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,220
You are slower, brother.

664
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,032
And weaker.

665
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:22,166
Aww...

666
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,799
Go on, take it.

667
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,924
Is this the monster
that terrified my men?

668
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,342
Hmm?

669
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,854
You grow more weary
by the moment.

670
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,601
Tell me,

671
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,820
how long can you bear it in here?
Huh?

672
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,774
Long enough to strike your name

673
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,700
from the history books.

674
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,648
Papa!

675
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,536
Take a last look
at your father, ingeras.

676
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:32,610
No!

677
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:33,870
Look how pathetic he is.

678
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,368
No, stop!

679
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:36,950
Please!

680
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,673
If I put a stake
through your heart,

681
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,839
it will kill you

682
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,050
like any other man.

683
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,555
A fitting death

684
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,233
for Lord Impaler. INGERAS: No!
No!

685
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,452
Papa!

686
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,334
That is no longer my name.

687
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,678
My name is Dracula.

688
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,639
Son of the Devil.

689
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,806
It's all right.

690
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,592
I'm here.

691
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,672
You old goat.

692
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,795
I don't feel old.

693
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,341
How many are left?

694
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:58,136
None, except for your son,
of course.

695
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,639
A distraction we can now

696
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,599
dispense with.

697
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:09,894
What have I taught you?

698
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:14,858
Repeated over and over since you
were a boy?

699
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,821
All that matters
is a prince's duty to his people.

700
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,455
Ingeras.

701
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,907
Don't you realize?

702
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,077
They're all our enemies now.

703
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,413
When he's gone,

704
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,214
you'll be free.

705
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:41,600
You forget who I am.

706
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:20,839
Leave him.

707
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:28,772
Come with me, child.

708
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,391
Come.

709
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,570
Please.

710
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,025
Be gone!

711
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:39,692
The time has come.

712
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:41,110
Please.

713
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,740
Please, you must come.

714
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,873
I don't want to leave you!

715
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:48,666
You have to go with him.

716
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:49,743
No!

717
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,545
Do not leave his side.

718
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,343
Please. Know
I will always love you.

719
01:19:58,502 --> 01:19:59,924
Always.

720
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,889
Go! No!

721
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,475
Go!

722
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,397
No!

723
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,312
You take care of him.

724
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,816
No!

725
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,271
Papa!

726
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,699
No!

727
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,080
He's safe now, Mirena.

728
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:01,338
<i>The Turks never conquered
the capitals of Europe.

729
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:10,305
<i>Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.

730
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:17,642
<i>But there are no pictures
or statues of him.

731
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,073
<i>I am his legacy.

732
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,742
<i>His sacrifice taught me
that even after the darkest night,

733
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,741
<i>the sun will rise again.

734
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,501
Drink, master.

735
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,790
<i>For if the heart
is strong enough,

736
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,047
<i>the soul is reborn

737
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,297
<i>with each new day.

738
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,726
<i>In life after life.

739
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:58,060
<i>Age after age.

740
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,479
<i>Forever.

741
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,038
Lovely.

742
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,950
Which markets are you
at this week?

743
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,494
Portobello Road next.

744
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,207
See you there?

745
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:30,214
Beautiful.

746
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,928
The flowers, my lady.

747
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,306
My lady?

748
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,141
Where are you from?

749
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,690
A long way from here.

750
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,026
Well, good night.

751
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,865
"Why think separately
of this life and the next"

752
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,625
"when one is born
from the last?"

753
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,133
That's my favorite poem.

754
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,337
It speaks to you of yearning,

755
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,968
of one soul pleading
for another.

756
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,137
I'm Mina.

757
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,355
Vlad.

758
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,556
Let the games begin.

759
01:24:58,656 --> 01:25:03,656
