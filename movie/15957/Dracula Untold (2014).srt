2
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,432
In the year of our Lord, 1442.

3
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:30,136
The Turkish Sultan enslaved
1,000 Transylvanian boys

4
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:34,181
to fill the ranks of his army.

5
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:40,618
These child slaves were beaten without mercy.

6
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:43,728
Trained to kill without conscience,

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,595
to crave blood of...all who fight...

8
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:49,539
the Turks.

9
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,466
From among these boys...

10
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:02,743
one grew into a warrior, so fierce...

11
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:05,282
that entire armies would
retreat in terror...

12
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,480
with the mention of his name.

13
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:12,682
Vlad the Impaler.

14
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:16,712
Son...of the Dragon.

15
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:22,380
Sickened by his monstrous act,

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,409
Vlad came to bury his past with the dead

17
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:28,477
and returned to Transylvania
to rule in peace.

18
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,775
His subjects called him Prince.

19
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,144
I call him father

20
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,750
but the world would come to know him as...

21
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:40,247
Dracula.

22
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:59,994
I left it...

23
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,080
where I found it.

24
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,027
What do yöu think, Vlad?

25
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:12,622
Bring it to me.

26
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,771
This belongs to a scout.
One of Hamza Bey's men.

27
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:32,000
What the hell is a lone
Turk doing out here?

28
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:37,264
Turkish scouts never travel alone.
If there is one, there is more.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,442
And whatever they scout...
they conquer.

30
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:50,801
This is washed downstream.

31
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,008
It came from up there.

32
00:02:58,424 --> 00:02:59,723
Broken Tooth Mountain.

33
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:04,679
Soon it'll be night.
They'll seek refuge.

34
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:10,670
Dumitru, I need yöu to return to the castle.
Alert the guards and double the sentry.

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,305
What? I'm not leaving yöu here.

36
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:15,431
The Turks crossed into my land
unannounced, it's a sign of war.

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,010
What are yöu going to do
if yöu find them?

38
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,296
I'll do what Princes do best, negotiate.

39
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,271
Nicolai, Andre, with me.

40
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,647
Move it.

41
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:55,285
Anything?

42
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:11,647
Smells like yöur feet.

43
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,479
They're inside.

44
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:27,149
How do yöu know?

45
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:30,924
Bats don't come out during the day.
Something's disturbed them.

46
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:35,658
Come on.

47
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:24,189
What is it, my Lord?

48
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,075
The floor...

49
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,182
it's crushed bone.

50
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,591
The Turks didn't do this.

51
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:45,967
What's that?

52
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:52,613
We leave, now!

53
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,945
The creature yöu encountered
was no accident, my Prince.

54
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:06,656
Four nights ago every brother in our order
awoke from an identical dream,

55
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:11,918
I would not have thought it possible, had I not
suffered the same vision myself that night.

56
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:16,693
All these creatures lay siege to this holy place.

57
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:23,417
The Romans mystics prophesized
the coming of a great evil.

58
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:25,857
A vampire.

59
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,243
From the Greek word, Vry...

60
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,495
"To drink".

61
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,951
The beast was once a mortal man,

62
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:38,732
who summoned the demon from the depth of hell

63
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,014
to trade for his dark power.

64
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:45,491
The demon tricked the man,
granting his wish

65
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:49,717
but his price was eternally condemned
to the darkness of that cave,

66
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:53,182
where he remains until he finds another...

67
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:55,881
to set him free.

68
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,810
Now yöu know its true face.

69
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,649
The people of Transylvania lived
in enough fear of the Turks' return.

70
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,692
Promise me yöu'll guard
this secret, brother.

71
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,137
Papa!

72
00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:25,089
I miss yöu.

73
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:26,558
And I , yöu.

74
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:30,450
My big soldier.

75
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,219
What, an embrace, but no kiss?

76
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,458
<font color="#808080">-</font> Are we going to argue?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yöu always leaving me and my family.

77
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:44,750
I miss yöu.

78
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,918
Something troubles yöu, what is it?

79
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:54,579
Only the impossible depth of yöur beauty,

80
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,375
puts the rest of the world to shame.

81
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,668
Pay no attention to yöur father, Ingeras.

82
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,974
Flattery is a cheap distraction from truth.

83
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:04,793
Ah, she knows all my tricks.

84
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,447
Yöu're a terrible liar.
It's one of yöur most endearing qualities.

85
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,503
It's Ingeras' time for bed.

86
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:23,521
<font color="#808080">-</font> Can we go riding tomorrow, Papa?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Of course we can.

87
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:25,783
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yöu most certainly cannot!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Why not?

88
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,181
Because tomorrow is the
day of our risen Lord.

89
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,521
<font color="#808080">-</font> Ah, of course.
<font color="#808080">-</font> That's Easter.

90
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,938
What was I thinking...

91
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:40,879
So, what attacked yöu?

92
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,331
Wolves?

93
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,048
I suppose.

94
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,886
All I know...is that I've
lost two good men today.

95
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,224
There is something more...

96
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,270
I was the same age as Ingeras,
when I was sent to live with the Turks.

97
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,274
To fight for them.

98
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,430
If I never saw another,
it would be too soon.

99
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,489
Yöu're home now.

100
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,270
For almost as many years as yöu were gone.

101
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:45,776
I just want peace...

102
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,303
that's all.

103
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:16,425
My fellow Transylvanians, an Easter toast.

104
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:19,236
Ten years of peace and prosperity,

105
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,496
ever since our Prince came back to us.

106
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,670
My old friend, here is to 20 more.

107
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,610
Hamza Bey... welcome.

108
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:03,175
We were not expecting yöu so soon.

109
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:07,527
Sultan Mehmed The Second offers
his salutations to yöu and yöur son.

110
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:10,434
Thank yöu. I have his tribute ready.

111
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:22,098
I am afraid...there is something more
than a tribute to discuss.

112
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,052
The Turks have no enemies here.

113
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:27,139
Did yöu think we would not have noticed a battalion of our scouts...

114
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:29,485
<font color="#808080">-</font> ...missing?
<font color="#808080">-</font> I did not kill them.

115
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,875
It still lives inside yöu, Lord Impaler.

116
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:39,549
Locked in a dark cage, hidden away.

117
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:46,305
But yöu and I, we both know it's there.

118
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,627
The Sultan's tribute, take it and leave.

119
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,802
There is one last thing.

120
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:13,971
The Sultan requires
1,000 boys to join his Janissary call.

121
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:17,981
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Never!

122
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:22,517
Janissary! He ended
that practice years ago.

123
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:26,648
When a soldier is plucked as a child...

124
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,126
and raised to know no other life...

125
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,039
he'll kill without question
and die without complaint.

126
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:39,301
Any who are 15 years of age or older,
will fight in Hungary.

127
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:43,361
Those 10 to 14 will be made
ready for the seize on Vienna.

128
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,716
The Sultan expects obedience.

129
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:52,306
After all...it was yöur own father
who gave yöu up without a fight.

130
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,521
Soft, but they'll do.

131
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:02,407
Don't, please.

132
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,787
Do yöu know who I am?

133
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:14,220
Yöu mean who yöu were.

134
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:19,135
Yöu have no army and no choice, Prince.

135
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,705
Follow our command,
or suffer the consequences.

136
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,098
It must be done.

137
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:40,423
Courage, anger, even love,
none of these can matter to a Prince.

138
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:44,158
All that matters is his
duty to his people.

139
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,695
What does it mean to be a royal hostage?

140
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,875
My father gave me to the Sultan
to prove his loyalty.

141
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,047
Were yöu scared there? With them?

142
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:00,985
I wanted to make my father proud.

143
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,689
Do yöu have to give me to the Sultan?

144
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:10,243
That was a long time ago.

145
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,957
Yöu've nothing to worry about,
do yöu understand?

146
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,962
Good.

147
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:40,377
If I defied the order, they'd
kill a 100 for every one I saved.

148
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,782
Yöu told me yöu and Mehmed
were once like brothers.

149
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:46,984
Why didn't yöu ask...

150
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,886
Isn't it possible he might
show yöu some mercy?

151
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,567
Have yöu seen the like of it?

152
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,679
Soon the entire world will be Turk.

153
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:37,938
Lord Impaler...

154
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,371
my oldest of friends.

155
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:45,180
I miss our days together.

156
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,221
What I missed my time with yöu...

157
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:48,741
is the coffee.

158
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,950
It's true, my father's power is
a cruel place for a yöung boy far from home.

159
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,857
But soon yöu talked like us,
prayed like us, fought like us...

160
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,562
speakig of which...I am owed 1,000 boys.

161
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:07,889
Why have I not seen them?

162
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:10,783
Mehmed, my brother.

163
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,906
<font color="#808080">-</font> I will grant yöu anything else...
<font color="#808080">-</font> I need soldiers...

164
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:17,984
brother.

165
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:26,039
Then take me.

166
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,316
I'm worth a 1,000 boys and yöu know it.

167
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:34,201
<font color="#808080">-</font> Those kings would tremble if they knew.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Then accept my offer.

168
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,210
When we were boys, how I longed
to fight side-by-side.

169
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,997
But now I'm Sultan, what need have I
for one more soldier?

170
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,866
I will have my 1000 boys.

171
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,390
And one more.

172
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:52,559
Yöur son will be raised under my roof.

173
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:56,233
Just like yöu were raised
under the roof by my father.

174
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:58,853
Yöu may retain yöur throne.

175
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:04,199
But General Ismail will remain to see
that my orders are fulfilled.

176
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,258
Please. Do not do this.

177
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:08,999
What is one son?

178
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:13,214
If yöu're virile, yöu'll make plenty more.

179
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,414
Yöu promised this would never happen.

180
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,931
<font color="#808080">-</font> Marina, listen...
<font color="#808080">-</font> The day yöu asked for my hand,
do yöu remember what I said?

181
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,387
Yöu said: 'No, stay my only friend..."

182
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,652
I knew what happens to
the sons of the Queen.

183
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,588
Yöu said things would be different.

184
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,383
Yöu said that if I loved yöu, I should trust yöu.

185
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,866
<font color="#808080">-</font> I love yöu.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Then trust me.

186
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:07,453
That's a death wish to start a war.

187
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,700
The Great Impaler can't please his woman.

188
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,765
It's fine, boys.
Just saying the goodbyes, that's all.

189
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,613
Promise me, he's my family!

190
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:18,412
Stop it, don't touch me!

191
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:21,720
I won't let them do that!!

192
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:32,297
I'll go!

193
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:44,528
I can do it.

194
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,027
Yöu're proud of me, aren't yöu?

195
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,700
Of course, I am.

196
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,764
Yöu have chosen wisely

197
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,794
but I've to say...I'm a little disappointed, frankly...

198
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,719
I expected more...resistance from yöu.

199
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:32,181
<font color="#808080">-</font> Run to yöur mother.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

200
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:33,706
Now!!

201
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,915
Mehmed will punish all of Transylvania
for what yöu have done.

202
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,828
It's not a child's place
to save his country.

203
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,944
Get my family to the castle.

204
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,185
Mehmed will be sending others soon enough.
War will come!

205
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:40,634
Yöu can't protect us.

206
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:45,033
I'll find a way.

207
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:48,429
Vlad, where are yöu going?

208
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:52,268
Whatever horror in Broken Tooth,
I know it kills Turks.

209
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:55,797
Yöu returned...

210
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:02,797
No one has ever returned...

211
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:12,212
It seems no one has ever had
the privilege of leaving either.

212
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:15,265
Neither will yöu.

213
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:57,180
Those men were reeked of fear

214
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:02,085
and yöu...I sense hope.

215
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,456
Yöur silver offends me, cloak it from my sight.

216
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:21,359
What kind of man crawled into his own grave
in search of hope, hm?

217
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:23,753
A desperate one.

218
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,291
The Turks threaten to destroy my kingdom.

219
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,108
Power like yöurs...I could stop them.

220
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,133
Save my people,
save my family.

221
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,871
How supremely noble, Lord Impaler,

222
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,657
Haus Dracul,
Son of the Devil.

223
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,291
Yöu are mistaken.

224
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,258
It means Son of the Dragon,
protector of the innocent.

225
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:56,876
Do yöur people know
how many innocents yöu've killed?

226
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,749
Was it...hundreds?

227
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,548
Yes.

228
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:11,018
Lie to me again and I'll open
yöu from yöur belly to yöur brain

229
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:13,083
and feed on yöur intestine.

230
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:14,630
Thousands.

231
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,264
And when yöu put them to the stake,
what did yöu feel?

232
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:20,982
Shame, horror, power?

233
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,837
<font color="#808080">-</font> Answer me!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Nothing!

234
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:29,623
I felt nothing.
No greater crime than the act itself.

235
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:33,357
Then why spill blood if not
for the pleasure of it?

236
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:38,592
Because men do not fear swords...
they fear monsters.

237
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:44,946
They run from them. By putting
one village
to the stake, I spared ten more.

238
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:48,893
Sometimes the world no longer needs a hero.

239
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:53,254
Sometimes what it needs...is a monster.

240
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,233
And yöu believe yöu know what it is,
to be a monster? Hm?

241
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:28,088
Yöu have no idea

242
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,380
but I am going to show yöu.

243
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:39,397
For centuries these mouldering walls
have been my gallows

244
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:43,679
and I'm bound to this cave, condemned by the one who turned me.

245
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:48,145
Oh, I've waited an eternity
for a man of yöur strength,

246
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:52,747
yöur gifts, yöur will.
A man, worthy of the dark...

247
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,731
and all it's powers.

248
00:26:56,541 --> 00:27:00,350
For if I am yöur salvation,
yöu are mine.

249
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,363
Drink, yöu will have a taste of my power

250
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:15,596
and the strength of 100 men,

251
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:17,987
the speed of a falling star,

252
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:24,283
dominion over the night and all it's creatures,
to see and hear through their senses.

253
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:31,323
<font color="#808080">-</font> Even heals grievous wounds...
<font color="#808080">-</font> At what price?

254
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:36,839
Once yöu drink, yöur thirst
for human blood will be insatiable.

255
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:41,566
But if yöu can resist for three days...

256
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:46,399
yöu'll return to yöur mortal state,
having sampled my power,

257
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,682
perhaps save yöur people.

258
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:52,981
<font color="#808080">-</font> And if I feed?
<font color="#808080">-</font> The price will be worse than if
yöu'd never stepped in here.

259
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:59,855
But I'll be set free.
Having granted the darkness worthy of my offering,

260
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,848
yöu'll become its vessel, as I am.

261
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,436
A scourge on this earth,
designed to destroy

262
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:12,286
everything yöu hold dear.
Yöur land, yöur people, even yöur precious wife and son.

263
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:16,112
<font color="#808080">-</font> I would die before I harm them.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Indeed yöu'll, I'm afraid.

264
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:22,420
I, however, would at last be free to unleash
my wrath against the one who betrayed me.

265
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,759
And one day, I will call on yöu to serve me, my
pawn, ending the mortal game...of revenge.

266
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,462
<font color="#808080">-</font> This is not a game!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Aah, won't better way to endure eternity?

267
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:38,072
For this, little Prince, is the ultimate game.

268
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,419
Light versus dark.

269
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,485
Hope versus despair.

270
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:48,374
And all the world's fate
hangs in the balance.

271
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:52,465
And it will be my great pleasure
to disappoint yöu.

272
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:54,471
Drink.

273
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:01,552
Let the games begin.

274
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,069
What now?

275
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,145
Now...

276
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,264
yöu die.

277
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:56,792
Papa!

278
00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:24,856
Fire!

279
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:56,574
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yöu came back.
<font color="#808080">-</font> I always will.

280
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:01,250
<font color="#808080">-</font> Where were yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Searching for the strength I needed.

281
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:03,154
Yöu're back.

282
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:22,554
A good Prince would had given them up!

283
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,691
A good Prince would have
paid that price for peace.

284
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:29,912
But I give yöu my word...

285
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:33,297
we will not be defeated!

286
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,270
They brought war to our land!

287
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,434
They will pay dearly for it.

288
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,579
Fire!

289
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:11,886
Negotiations failed.

290
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,997
Do not ask me what happened
on this field tonight.

291
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:19,322
Trust only that I will use all I have
to keep us safe.

292
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,369
But we will not be safe if we stay here!

293
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:28,638
We must leave directly for Cosia Monastery.
It's high in the mountains,

294
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:30,444
too remote for cannon fire.

295
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:33,147
It's our best chance of survival.

296
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:37,227
We'll take enough of our people
so that our absence is noticed.

297
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,084
That way, when Mehmed learns
what has happened here,

298
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:44,223
he'll come hunting for us.

299
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,347
Word, from Castle Dracula.

300
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:49,458
Vlad has defeated thousands of our men.

301
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:54,473
Then send a hundred thousand,
I'll lead them.

302
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:59,608
When I march into Europe,
I will have his head upon my spear

303
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,786
and his child at my side.

304
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:06,768
We can fight the way our great
grandfathers fought.

305
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:10,660
Use the forests, the mountains around
the Burgo Pass.

306
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,971
<font color="#808080">-</font> 4 or 5 months of that.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not months.

307
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,620
I'm going to win this war in three days.

308
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,491
Why not two?
That'd really impress us.

309
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:54,324
What is it?

310
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:58,999
I need some air.

311
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:01,080
I'm sorry.

312
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:23,080
Don't think I haven't noticed
yöu following me.

313
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:25,339
Yöu're mistaken.

314
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:30,721
I follow them. They recognize
one of their own.

315
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,396
The night is their kingdom...

316
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:37,860
blood, their sustenance.

317
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:44,065
And some they say, can live for
as long as there're prey to be devoured.

318
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,352
Spare me yöur ravings.

319
00:40:48,253 --> 00:40:51,098
They said the one who escaped the mountain,

320
00:40:51,472 --> 00:40:54,295
hides behind the face of a man.

321
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:58,305
Well, if that man is me...

322
00:40:58,994 --> 00:41:01,230
yöu know a knife would not
do yöu any good.

323
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,172
Of course not.

324
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,599
Why do yöu think I stayed?

325
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,810
I know there is only

326
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:18,084
so far on this earth they can run

327
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:23,466
and it's not far enough.

328
00:41:27,248 --> 00:41:29,077
Let me serve yöu.

329
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:43,948
Stay away from me.

330
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,418
Yes, master.

331
00:42:05,517 --> 00:42:08,115
Fulfill yöur destiny.

332
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:11,766
Set me free.

333
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:32,489
We found him in the field.
He ​​asked for yöu.

334
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,696
A message from Prince Vlad.

335
00:42:40,944 --> 00:42:43,228
He hopes...yöu enjoy the view.

336
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:35,580
Yöur scars are gone?

337
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:41,194
What's happening to yöu?

338
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,233
I met a dead man on Brooken Tooth.

339
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:56,638
Not a ghost...something else.

340
00:44:07,677 --> 00:44:12,228
No! Stop it!
Let God strike down whoever did this to yöu.

341
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:13,670
I chose this.

342
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,299
This is the strength yöu sought?

343
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,191
But why?

344
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:28,007
Because I sent corpses back to Mehmed

345
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:30,443
instead of our son.

346
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:35,718
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yöu did this for us?
<font color="#808080">-</font> In two days I'll be restored.

347
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:39,516
I just have to resist.

348
00:44:42,108 --> 00:44:43,416
Resist what?

349
00:44:47,196 --> 00:44:49,131
Resist what, Vlad?
Tell me!

350
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:51,961
The thirst...

351
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:55,133
for blood.

352
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:02,260
And if yöu were to give in?

353
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:05,961
Then I become this for eternity.

354
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:14,751
Yöu will not do this, won't yöu?

355
00:45:16,035 --> 00:45:19,041
I swear, I will not give in.

356
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:22,244
Then God will forgive yöu.

357
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:24,825
Vlad!

358
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:28,368
Mehmed is getting closer.
Yöu might want to move out soon.

359
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:32,457
I need yöu to get to the monastery
as quickly as yöu can.

360
00:45:32,714 --> 00:45:34,354
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mehmed's men will be close behind.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!

361
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:35,091
Listen to me.

362
00:45:35,728 --> 00:45:37,590
I will reach yöu after sundown.

363
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:38,995
I promise yöu.

364
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:48,789
I love yöu.

365
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:05,487
My husband agrees with yöur council.

366
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:09,074
We'll depart now,
under yöur temporary command.

367
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:13,284
<font color="#808080">-</font> What? Where is Vlad going to be?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Spying on the Turks.

368
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:17,006
<font color="#808080">-</font> He insists on doing his own reconnaissance.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.

369
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:20,843
<font color="#808080">-</font> I won't allow it.
<font color="#808080">-</font> It's too late. He's already gone.

370
00:46:24,953 --> 00:46:27,922
All right, everyone,
prepare to move out!

371
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:48,870
Tell the Sultan where his
enemies will be buried.

372
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:18,266
Listen.

373
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,968
We are nearly there.

374
00:47:39,604 --> 00:47:41,720
Go to the rear!

375
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:18,655
Couldn't these monks put the gate
a little bit closer!

376
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:31,078
Stay behind me.

377
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:54,635
Didn't the Turks teach yöu anything, eh?
I saw yöur blade coming from...

378
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:00,318
Ingeras, run!

379
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:02,798
Where is yöur prince now,

380
00:49:03,995 --> 00:49:05,298
My Lady?

381
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:41,772
It's OK.

382
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,083
It's OK.

383
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:47,542
Vlad...

384
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,670
Dumitru, listen, listen!

385
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:19,616
Come here.

386
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:24,307
Never leave us again, Papa.

387
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,543
Never.
I will always watch over yöu.

388
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:36,767
To the gate!

389
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:43,536
Keep moving along!
This way!

390
00:50:57,947 --> 00:50:59,962
Yöu should never have strayed from us.

391
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:02,189
<font color="#808080">-</font> whatever yöur reasons were.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Quiet!

392
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:09,774
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get these men off their knees!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Stand up, do yöu hear me? Stand up!

393
00:51:10,979 --> 00:51:15,256
The Turks are coming!
Prayers will not defend these walls!

394
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,991
Do yöu believe we can do this?

395
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:27,747
Mehmed's men will be coming from the north.

396
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:33,122
Double our sentries on
the perimeter walls. Go! Do it now!

397
00:51:33,147 --> 00:51:34,145
What's in there?

398
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:39,486
Something I hoped to never use again.

399
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,114
Come now.

400
00:51:52,805 --> 00:51:55,324
The men say that Vlad has become a monster.

401
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,937
I fear this will only inflate the rumors
of the Prince's dark magic.

402
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:01,643
Only if we allow it.

403
00:52:03,196 --> 00:52:05,493
Men cannot fear what they cannot see.

404
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:15,662
Remember when yöu first joined my army?

405
00:52:16,324 --> 00:52:19,001
Yöu wanted to pick up yöur sword and fight!

406
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:23,831
When my generals blindfolded yöu...

407
00:52:24,738 --> 00:52:29,192
yöu did not believe that yöu could
march without seeing

408
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,119
but yöu could.

409
00:52:34,144 --> 00:52:39,752
Now march with me.
Yöur Sultan will guide yöu!

410
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:43,109
Prince Vlad, the vampire is
vulnerable to daylight

411
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:49,247
and to pure silver.

412
00:53:56,092 --> 00:53:58,741
Yet the Holy Cross exerts
no power over yöu.

413
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:02,649
That can only mean yöu have yet
to seal yöur fate with human blood.

414
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:08,035
Let me kill yöu now, my Prince,
please,

415
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:12,908
before yöur people do.
Rumors have spread of what yöu've become.

416
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,483
Yöu can still repent.

417
00:54:17,162 --> 00:54:18,903
Yöu'll do well to run, Lucian.

418
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,148
It's true, he's a monster!

419
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:46,998
Please, listen. He is yöur Prince.
Give him a chance to explain!

420
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,530
<font color="#808080">-</font> Please! Stop, please!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Kill the monster!

421
00:54:52,442 --> 00:54:54,305
Satan lives in his heart!

422
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:20,853
He was trying to save his soul.

423
00:55:33,828 --> 00:55:37,344
Take him to my room and shut the door.
Do not let him not look outside.

424
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:38,673
<font color="#808080">-</font> OK.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mama!

425
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,524
This is yöur loyalty?
Yöur gratitude?

426
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:14,031
Fools.

427
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,702
Do yöu think yöu're alive
because yöu can fight?

428
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:24,884
Yöu're alive because of me!

429
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,432
Because of what I did to save yöu!

430
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:41,337
This is not who yöu are.

431
00:56:58,022 --> 00:56:59,516
Return to yöur stations.

432
00:57:01,158 --> 00:57:04,781
Believe me, there's
still more to fear!

433
00:57:09,522 --> 00:57:10,600
Lord,

434
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:13,255
if yöu've not yet forsaken me,

435
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,874
grant me the strength to resist the darkness.

436
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,457
Allow me to endure this test one more day.

437
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:26,328
I beg yöu.

438
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,553
Please...

439
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:48,678
Are yöu sick?

440
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:56,690
If yöu're sick, I thought
this might make yöu feel better.

441
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,266
Thank yöu. Come.

442
00:58:14,626 --> 00:58:16,296
Yöu'll make a great leader some day

443
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,583
Yöu think of others before yöurself.

444
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:26,140
When the Turks came to take me,
yöu stopped them.

445
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:32,425
That's why yöu got sick, isn't it?
To save me?

446
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:35,863
Yes,

447
00:58:38,487 --> 00:58:40,543
and I'll do it all again.

448
00:59:13,878 --> 00:59:15,522
They are almost here.

449
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:22,577
Dawn will be breaking soon
and with it the loss of my power.

450
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:28,935
<font color="#808080">-</font> If we've not won this war by then...
<font color="#808080">-</font> I'll fight beside yöu until death.

451
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,031
Yöur death would end my fight.

452
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:34,105
We have done the duty of any good parent,

453
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:36,603
protected our child,

454
00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:38,789
protected all the children in the kingdom.

455
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:42,736
Perhaps our destiny was
not to rule in this life.

456
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:46,961
Do yöu remember our wedding vow?

457
00:59:49,928 --> 00:59:52,465
Why think separately of
this life and the next...

458
00:59:52,765 --> 00:59:54,407
...when one is born from the last.

459
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:58,788
Time is always too short
for those who need it .

460
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:03,861
But for those who love...last forever.

461
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,671
Hold yöur positions!

462
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,829
Fire!

463
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:54,956
Where is he?

464
01:03:55,394 --> 01:03:56,826
Fire!

465
01:04:08,102 --> 01:04:10,932
Find yöur father, go!

466
01:04:22,956 --> 01:04:24,069
Where is he?

467
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:35,575
Yöu can keep running if yöu like.

468
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:46,363
Mama!

469
01:04:48,572 --> 01:04:51,343
<font color="#808080">-</font> Let me go!
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!

470
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:52,343
Mirena!

471
01:04:58,371 --> 01:05:02,170
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, please.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Ingeras!

472
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:22,249
Please stay with me.

473
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:25,748
I cannot do this without yöu.

474
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:51,333
There's still time
for yöu to stop them.

475
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:55,934
Drink my blood.

476
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,217
No... I cannot take yöur life.

477
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:03,910
My life is lost already

478
01:07:06,529 --> 01:07:08,676
but our son's is not.

479
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,780
I love yöu.

480
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:20,082
Do it now!

481
01:07:26,831 --> 01:07:27,707
Please.

482
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,364
Do it now.

483
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:56,446
Do yöu want vengeance?

484
01:09:06,885 --> 01:09:07,804
Drink.

485
01:09:49,045 --> 01:09:51,212
I know now hell is real.

486
01:09:51,915 --> 01:09:54,141
So I know there is a heaven.

487
01:09:55,795 --> 01:09:58,284
Neither this world nor the next
shall keep us apart.

488
01:10:01,033 --> 01:10:05,098
I will honor yöur sacrifice and I vow
that our son shall be safe.

489
01:10:12,218 --> 01:10:16,557
Of all my lands,
this is the one I love the least.

490
01:10:20,774 --> 01:10:21,976
Look to the East.

491
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:26,284
The sun should be risen by now,
should it not?

492
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:37,814
What is that?

493
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:46,043
It is the Prince.
He's coming.

494
01:11:33,971 --> 01:11:36,587
I used to think
there were too many of yöu.

495
01:11:37,108 --> 01:11:38,858
Now, it's not enough.

496
01:12:37,026 --> 01:12:39,191
I understand yöu've a weakness

497
01:12:40,295 --> 01:12:41,320
for silver.

498
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:52,674
Papa!

499
01:12:55,923 --> 01:12:57,187
He is waiting for yöu.

500
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,316
Yöu're slower brother...and weaker.

501
01:13:48,898 --> 01:13:51,312
Go on, take it.

502
01:13:52,576 --> 01:13:55,306
Is this the monster that terrified my men?

503
01:13:59,074 --> 01:14:01,153
Yöu grow more weary by the moment.

504
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:07,864
Tell me, how long
can yöu bear it in here, huh?

505
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:13,190
Long enough to strike
yöur name from the history books.

506
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:49,313
Papa!

507
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,039
Take a last look at yöur father, Ingeras.

508
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:59,474
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Look how pathetic he is.

509
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:01,641
Stop, please!

510
01:15:09,747 --> 01:15:12,961
If I put a stake thru' yöur heart,

511
01:15:15,004 --> 01:15:16,170
it will kill yöu...

512
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,428
like any other man.

513
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:26,978
<font color="#808080">-</font> A fitting death,
for Lord...Impaler.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!

514
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,424
Papa!

515
01:15:51,682 --> 01:15:53,623
That's no longer my name.

516
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:56,177
My name is Dracula.

517
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:00,280
Son of the Devil.

518
01:16:39,738 --> 01:16:42,425
It's all right.
I'm here.

519
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:15,988
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yöu old goat.
<font color="#808080">-</font> I don't feel old.

520
01:17:18,545 --> 01:17:22,884
<font color="#808080">-</font> How many are left?
<font color="#808080">-</font> None, except for yöur son, of course.

521
01:17:23,593 --> 01:17:27,348
A distraction we can now...dispense with.

522
01:17:33,402 --> 01:17:34,815
What have I thought yöu?

523
01:17:35,876 --> 01:17:39,599
Repeated, over and over,
since yöu were a boy?

524
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:44,419
All that matters is a
Prince's duty to his people.

525
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:47,542
Don't yöu realize?

526
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,699
They all are our enemies now.

527
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:55,216
When he is gone, yöu'll be free.

528
01:18:03,173 --> 01:18:06,540
Yöu forget who I am!

529
01:18:44,568 --> 01:18:45,752
Leave him.

530
01:18:52,489 --> 01:18:54,018
Come with me, child.

531
01:18:58,509 --> 01:18:59,336
Please.

532
01:19:00,109 --> 01:19:01,917
Get back!

533
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:08,045
This has to stop.
Please! Please, Vlad's son.

534
01:19:10,115 --> 01:19:11,953
I do not want to leave yöu.

535
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:15,224
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yöu have to go with him.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!

536
01:19:15,882 --> 01:19:17,508
Do not leave his sight.

537
01:19:20,952 --> 01:19:23,435
Please know that I will always love yöu.

538
01:19:23,815 --> 01:19:24,681
Always.

539
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:33,136
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Go!

540
01:19:34,295 --> 01:19:36,822
<font color="#808080">-</font> No!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yöu take care of him!

541
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:42,469
No, papa!

542
01:19:57,178 --> 01:19:59,060
He's safe now, Mirena.

543
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:25,575
The Turks never conquered
the capitals of Europe.

544
01:21:32,165 --> 01:21:34,776
Prince Vlad Dracula was a hero.

545
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:42,780
But, there're no pictures
or statues of him.

546
01:21:48,339 --> 01:21:50,559
I am his legacy.

547
01:21:52,334 --> 01:21:56,576
His sacrifice taught me that
even after the darkest night,

548
01:21:57,038 --> 01:21:58,428
the sun will rise again.

549
01:21:59,896 --> 01:22:01,620
Drink, master.

550
01:22:03,694 --> 01:22:08,846
For if the heart is strong enough,
the soul is reborn

551
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,950
with each new day,

552
01:22:16,058 --> 01:22:18,380
in life after life,

553
01:22:20,907 --> 01:22:23,254
age after age,

554
01:22:27,358 --> 01:22:29,064
forever.

555
01:22:54,605 --> 01:22:55,539
Beautiful...

556
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:00,976
the flowers, my Lady.

557
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:03,183
My lady?

558
01:23:05,097 --> 01:23:08,900
<font color="#808080">-</font> Where are yöu from?
<font color="#808080">-</font> A long way from here.

559
01:23:15,298 --> 01:23:16,570
Well, good night.

560
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:20,371
Why think seperately
of this life and the next...

561
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:23,489
when one is born from the last.

562
01:23:29,932 --> 01:23:31,854
It's my favorite poem.

563
01:23:32,365 --> 01:23:36,545
It speaks to yöur yearning,
of one soul pleading for another.

564
01:23:41,888 --> 01:23:42,550
I'm Mina.

565
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:46,067
Vlad.

566
01:24:21,677 --> 01:24:24,673
Let the games begin.
