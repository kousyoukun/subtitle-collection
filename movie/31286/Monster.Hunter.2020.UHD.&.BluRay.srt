"在我们的感官背后,绝对有可能

隐藏着不为我们所知的新世界"

3
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:41,309
新世界

00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,816
恶魔!
Diablos!

00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,244
怪物猎人

[可口可乐]

7
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:58,422
我们的世界

<i>主猎鹰,这是B队.你听到吗?</i>
<i>Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team.
Do you copy?</i>

12
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,113
<i>暴风雨来了.可见度为零.请立即支援.</i>
<i>Storm incoming. Zero visibility.

15
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,714
队长.
Ma'am. Ma'am.

16
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,675
-马歇尔.
-林克在前面半公里处有所发现.
- Marshall.
- Link found something half a klick ahead.

17
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,969
-是B队吗?
-我认为是他们.
- Bravo Team?
- Think so.

18
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,405
艾克斯...
Axe.

19
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,514
-跟着斯蒂勒.负责机关枪.
-是的,队长.
- With Steeler. Man the 50.
- Yes, boss.

20
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,099
好了,女士们.
All right, ladies.

21
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,058
出发.
Saddle up.

22
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:56,272
她是女人但她的语气还是像羞辱人.
She's a woman, but she still manages
to make that sound like an insult.

23
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,357
习惯就好.
Get used to it.

24
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,158
队长.
Captain.

25
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,310
你看到这些里程碑吗?
You see those markers?

26
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,510
是的.我看到了.
Yeah, I see them.

27
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,429
你知道这些是什么吗?
Do you have any idea what they are?

28
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,265
戴维斯中士,
我是游骑兵,不是考古学家.
Sergeant Davis, I'm a Ranger,
not an archeologist.

29
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,143
收到.
Copy that.

30
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,607
艾克斯!
Axe!

31
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,127
什么?
What?

32
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,120
你在听什么?
What are you listening to?

33
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,154
乔治琼斯.
George Jones.

34
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,240
谁?
Who the hell's that?

35
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,361
斯蒂勒,你很庸俗.
You're a philistine, Steeler.

36
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,869
我是.
Yes. Yes, I am.

37
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,374
马歇尔, 你的反应很快.
Damn, Marshall. You got hella reflexes.

38
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,875
今天第十五个伤亡.
Fifteenth casualty today.

39
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,962
-杀光他们.
-戴维斯,不要留活口.
- Killing them.
- Take no prisoners, Davis.

40
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,314
-林克,你发现什么?
-肯定是B队.
- Link, what'd you find?
- It's definitely Bravo Team.

41
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,526
但它的踪迹到此为止.
But the tracks end here.

42
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,322
-B队乘什么到达这里?
-悍马武装车和马特-V.
- What were Bravo Team traveling in?
- Up-armored Humvee and a M-ATV.

43
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,077
那是10吨装甲车.不可能就这样消失.
That's ten tons of armored vehicle.
They don't just disappear.

44
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,496
队长.我们有所发现.
Boss, we've got something.

45
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,665
小心.十二点钟方向.
Incoming. On your 12.

46
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,172
-它们从那里来?
-突然出现.
- Where did that come from?
- Came out of nowhere.

47
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,757
B队在最后一次报告说遇到了风暴.
Bravo Team reported a storm
in their last transmission.

48
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,510
-敌方使用它作掩护?
-埋伏.好像在赫尔曼德吗?
- Hostiles using it for cover?
- An ambush. Like in Helmand?

49
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,553
我不想知道.
Let's not find out.

50
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,023
<i>准备袭击.</i>
<i>REDCON-1.</i>

51
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,359
如果有敌人躲在风暴后面,
情况会很危险.
If there are hostiles hiding
behind that storm, things might get kinetic.

52
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,319
收到.
Copy that.

53
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,501
马歇尔,你在干嘛?
Marshall, what are you doing, bro?

54
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,586
如果我的头被轰掉...
In case I get my head blown off,

55
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,213
他们还记得我是谁.
they can still tell who I am.

56
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,257
非常恶劣,混蛋.
Hardcore shit, <i>cabrón.</i>

57
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:41,687
Damn!

58
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,983
我的天,差一点.
Goddamn, that shit's close.

59
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,487
林克!你有看过这种闪电吗?
Link, you ever seen lightning
like this before?

60
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,322
从来没有.
No. Never.

61
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,492
但是我觉得在这个大铁盒里...
But I feel pretty secure here
in this big steel box,

62
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,494
拿着我的金属枪很安全.
holding my metal gun.

63
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,789
戴斯!你的十二点方向!
Dash, on your 12!

64
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,339
看那些里程碑!
Look at those markers!

65
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,927
什么东西?
What the hell is that?

66
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,138
-小心!
-该死的!
- Watch out!
- Damn it!

67
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,683
抓稳!
Brace yourselves!

68
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,658
Shit!

69
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,133
我们在那里?
Where the hell are we?

70
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,917
暴风雨发生了什么事?
And what happened to the storm?

71
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
刚才发生什么事?
What the hell just happened?

72
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,175
-嗨!
-大伙们!
- Hey!
- Guys!

73
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,635
你还好吗?
You okay?

74
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,345
我还没死.
I'll survive.

75
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,888
我们被闪电击中了吗?
Did we just get hit by lightning?

76
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,767
-斯蒂勒,你还好吗?
-我没事.
- Steeler, you good?
- Never better.

77
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,437
这些沙从哪里来?
Where did all this sand come from?

78
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,567
这不对.一切都很奇怪.
This isn't right, none of it.

79
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,779
那是什么?
What the hell is that?

80
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,492
我没看到地图上有任何建筑物或山脉.
I don't see any structures or mountains
marked on this map.

81
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,035
根据这里...
According to this,

82
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,455
最近的沙丘在20公里外.
the nearest sand dune is 20 klicks away.

83
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,749
-这怎么可能?
-我们在那里?
- How's that possible?
- Where the hell are we?

84
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,002
-我们怎么离开道路那么远?
-我不清楚.
- How did we get so far from the road?
- I don't know.

85
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,714
艾克斯,
爬上其中一个沙丘和设立观察点.
Axe, get on one of those dunes
and set up an observation point.

86
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,132
遵命.
Yes, boss.

87
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,009
斯蒂勒!
Steeler!

88
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,262
甲车还能动.它之前遇过更糟糕的情况.
DPV will run. She's had worse.

89
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,139
-马歇尔?
-队长,全球定位系统坏了.
- Marshall?
- GPS is fried, boss.

90
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,084
收音机和卫星电话没动静.
Radio and sat. All I get is static.

91
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,769
连指南针也坏了.一定是被雷击.
Even the compass is screwed up.
Must have been the lightning.

92
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,646
你想怎么做?
Well, what do you wanna do?

93
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,234
换模拟.靠太阳导航.
Go analog. Navigate by the sun.

94
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,653
回去基地.如果必须的话,我们步行.
Make it back to base.
We hoof it if we have to.

95
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,904
队长,那很遥远.
Boss, that's a long hike.

96
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,198
我们一直步行直到恢复通讯.
Yeah, well,
we keep going till we get comms.

97
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,202
AWACS将派出支援.
他们会派直升机或装甲车.
Then AWACS will call in support.
They'll send helos, maybe armor.

98
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,456
-很好.
-我们继续吧.
- Nice.
- Back in business.

99
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,749
<i>队长...</i>
<i>Boss.</i>

100
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,710
-说.
<i>-有些东西你必须看.</i>
- Send it.
-<i>There's something you got to see.</i>

101
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,435
武装DPV和马特-V.
Up-armored DPV and a M-ATV.

102
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,812
B队.
It's Bravo Team.

103
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,691
V队形.走吧.
V-formation. Move out.

104
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,993
我们如何处理他们?
What do we do about them?

105
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,580
恢复通讯后,
我们会通知回收队来取尸体.
When we get comms, we'll call in
recovery assets to retrieve the bodies.

106
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,335
-他们发生了什么事?
-喷火器.
- What happened to them?
- Flamethrowers.

107
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,003
我不这么认为.
I don't think so.

108
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,299
从未见过喷火器会造成人这样.
Never seen a flamethrower
do this to a man.

109
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,843
甚至凝固汽油也不是那么烫.
Not even napalm burns that hot.

110
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,844
队长...
Ma'am?

111
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,102
是玻璃.
It's glass.

112
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,273
玻璃?
Glass?

113
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,557
沙子融化后变成玻璃.
When sand melts, it turns to glass.

114
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,234
如何融化沙子?
How do you melt sand?

115
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,819
我不知道.
I don't know.

116
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,990
这超越我的职权范围.
This shit is officially above
my pay grade.

117
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,451
好像他们有打斗.
Looks like they made a stand.

118
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,330
开了很多枪.
Let off a lot of rounds.

119
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,567
但没有射中目标.
They didn't hit anything.

120
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,667
没有尸体.
There's no bodies.

121
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,419
也许他们带走尸体?
Maybe they took the bodies with them?

122
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,421
我以前看过这样的情形.
I've seen that before.

123
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,216
这就是问题.
Yeah.Well, that's just the thing.

124
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,926
林克,你看到什么东西?
What do you see, Link?

125
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,095
什么都没看到.
Nothing.

126
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,931
到处都没有痕迹.
No tracks anywhere.

127
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,225
不管是谁干的,他们没有留下痕迹.
Whoever did this,
they didn't leave a mark.

128
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,938
我们必须继续走.出发!
We need to get moving. Move out!

129
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,244
暗星呼叫猎鹰,请回答.
Dark Star to Falcon.
Dark Star to Falcon, over.

130
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,707
该死,电击破坏所有电子产品.
Damn it. Lightning really messed up
the electronics, huh?

131
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,084
不但是电子产品.
Not just electronics.

132
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,254
-什么意思?
-有什么不妥?
- What do you mean?
- This isn't right.

133
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,006
<i>全部都不妥.</i>
Nothing about this is right.

134
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,384
那闪电...对我们做了一些事情.
That lightning, it did something to us.

135
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,887
队长知道她在做什么,好吗?
Captain knows what she's doing, all right?

136
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,277
<i>他们说当兵会富有</i>
<i>They say that in the army
The pay is mighty fine</i>

137
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,656
<i>他们说当兵会富有</i>
<i>They say that in the army
The pay is mighty fine</i>

138
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,119
<i>他们给了100拿回99</i>

just before they breathe fire.
