You'll get us killed, motherfucker.

5
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,542
You get the fuck out of my car.

6
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,372
This is my car. Hell, no!

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,842
What are you, on crack?

8
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,216
Stop the fucking car!

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,551
Look, now get out and let me drive!

10
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,723
Get out!

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,093
Oh, yeah.
You have to go to a hospital.

12
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,360
<i>Yeah, you're wondering,</i>
<i>how the fuck did I get here?</i>

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,565
<i>I made some bad choices.</i>

14
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,978
<i>If it hadn't been for prison,</i>
<i>I never would've met Philomene.</i>

15
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,740
Knowledge is power.

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,285
<i>I'm Cape Verdean.</i>

17
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,079
<i>Got me expanding my horizons.</i>

00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,485
<i>Classic falling-for-your-caseworker,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

19
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>Philomene wasn't having it or me.</i>

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,368
<i>All I could do was read</i>
<i>and watch movies.</i>

21
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,005
<i>Anything but gangster flicks.</i>

22
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,174
<i>This shit reminded me</i>
<i>too much of my past.</i>

23
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,140
<i>And I was determined</i>
<i>to make sure my past...</i>

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,575
<i>...would not be my future.</i>

25
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,823
<i>You know, I worked odd jobs...</i>

26
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,985
<i>...and Philomene finally</i>
<i>took me seriously.</i>

27
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,126
<i>And we put what we had together,</i>
<i>bought a nice little place down south.</i>

28
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,466
<i>And as luck would have it,</i>
<i>she couldn't have kids.</i>

29
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,270
<i>So we got a dog.</i>

30
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,274
<i>She wanted to name him Lucky,</i>
<i>after me.</i>

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,245
<i>I said, hell, no.</i>
<i>Give the mutt a chance.</i>

32
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,886
<i>We called him Scraps.</i>

33
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,319
<i>For a moment, I thought</i>
<i>my luck might have changed.</i>

34
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,859
<i>Now, ain't that a bitch?</i>

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,497
<i>All the bullets I done caught over</i>
<i>the years and I get diverticulitis.</i>

36
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,996
<i>They said they had to</i>
<i>operate right away.</i>

37
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,059
<i>Maybe luck is a matter of timing.</i>

38
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,506
<i>When I woke up...</i>

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,033
<i>...seemed like</i>
<i>time had run out on all of us.</i>

40
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,212
Anybody down here?

41
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,279
Shit. What the fuck is going on?

42
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,422
<i>At first, I thought</i>
<i>the rapture had come and-- and--</i>

43
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,425
<i>Like those end-of-the-days preachers</i>
<i>are always talking about.</i>

44
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,158
<i>And J. C., he had come down</i>
<i>and taken everybody except me.</i>

45
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,661
Hello?

46

-Hey, come here, boy.
<i>-I repeat:</i>

-Yeah, Pops.
<i>-Hurricane Katrina, class-five.</i>

49

<i>Authorities are</i>
<i>now urging everyone...</i>

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,447
<i>...to make their way immediately</i>
<i>to the Superdome.</i>

51
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,244
Don't you trust them. Don't go.

52
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,820
Don't go.

<i>as to when that will be.</i>

55
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,690
<i>Maybe Mother Nature...</i>

56

<i>...was trying to give us</i>
<i>one last wake-up call.</i>

<i>Or...</i>

58
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,669
<i>...maybe it's like my grandpa said:</i>

<i>''If it wasn't for bad luck,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have no luck at all. ''</i>

<i>It's like a fantasy voyage or</i>

<i>And, like, I'm like James T. Kirk...</i>

00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,402
-What's up?
-Why you do this shit, man?

149
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,978
-What do you mean?
-What l mean, your family got paper.

150
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,548
Your uncle owns the jewelry store.

151
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,846
You're robbing your uncle.

152
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,319
Why you do this?
What do you do this for?

153
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,460
Why did you do it?

154
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,564
l mean, you were one of
the biggest hustlers in Harlem, man.

155
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,098
Mr. Untouchable?

156
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,032
Hey, you was poisoning
your own people.

157
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,230
-Yo.
-Yo. No offense, bro.

158
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:39,036
l mean, it's the American way, right?
We all want more.

159
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,213
Even Donald fucking Trump
wants more.

160
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,315
More-- More power,
more money, more bling.

161
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,882
More punani.

162
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,521
Yo, listen, it's real important to me that
you be on time tonight, you know?

163
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,986
-l'll send the fellas.
-l want to talk about that.

164
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,058
-What's up?
-l'm not gonna be able to roll, man.

165
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,492
-What are you talking about, man?
-You know, that's your thing, man.

166
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,724
-l ain't--
-Oh, but it's my birthday party, man.

167
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,231
We'll have a crazy time, son.

168
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,166
Look, l got all this shit for you.
You're gonna love it, man.

169
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,805
That's you, right there.

170
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,498
-l get to wear this?
-Yes, you get to wear this.

171
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,169
l don't know, man. l don't know.

172
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,449
No, man. That's your world.

173
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,177
This is my size.

174
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,445
-He likes it, he likes it.
-Yeah, baby.

175
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,751
She starts screwing around and
has no idea whose kid she's having.

176
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,256
Well, that's how she sees it.

177
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,894
-Don't get knocked up.
-Excuse me.

178
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,997
-Can you help me?
-Just saying, it's not fair to the kids.

179
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,893
Got it.

180
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,096
l'm going back in for the picnic table.

181
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,635
Hey, babe. Smile for the camera.

182
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,107
-You know how we do.
-Oh, yeah.

183
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,509
So you tell them about what we're
gonna do later on. All right?

184
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,143
l think they ready, sir.

185
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,152
Oh, yeah. They ready.
You see that today?

186
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,055
Oh, yeah, l saw that.

187
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,728
Hey, look, Mr. C.,
about those flyers and everything?

188
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,056
Ain't gotta worry about that.
l got that for free.

189
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,028
My man hooked me up
and everything--

190
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,962
Beautiful.

191
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,803
You'd think by now
that people would understand...

192
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,702
...that you reap what you sow.

193
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,236
Would you rather have your kids in
a dance group or a gang?

194
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,679
Dance group. Without question.

195
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,342
lt seems the government's
more interested in building prisons...

196
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,216
...than investing in the kids.

197
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,849
This is gonna be our last show.

198
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,894
They've taken away our funding,
so we've gotta close the place down.

199
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,766
Yeah, l know.

200
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,465
But don't you let this unravel
all the good work you've done.

201
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,313
For this place, for these kids.

202
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,709
Most of all, for yourself.

203
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,308
You've turned your life around.

204
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,581
You stayed on the path.

205
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,916
l was really looking forward to this,
you know?

206
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,394
Really looking forward to it.

207
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,160
All right, Mr. C.

208
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,671
Good luck to you, young brother.

209
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,535
Hey, you know how we do.

210
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,303
We're in the trenches, baby.
ln the trenches.

211
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,589
The bitches in this piece.

212
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,853
Sir, you're here with
the Rosenbaum's party.

213
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,359
Right this way, sir.

214
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,828
<i>Putting it down.</i>
<i>New Booty Room, to your right.</i>

<i>And on the stage right now...</i>

219
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,405

00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,170
<i>You gotta love Castro.</i>

221
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,645
<i>She swam over here for you,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

222
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,875
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>We gotta pay for that education.</i>

223
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,145
<i>Go in your pockets.</i>
<i>No food stamps. No coin.</i>

224
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,845
<i>Just stuff that folds.</i>

225
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,820
<i>Carmen putting it down for you.</i>

<i>Right here in The Cadillac Lounge.</i>
<i>This is DJ Big Cat.</i>

227
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,635
Yeah, go on, girl. Get triple-X with it.

228
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,036
Money to share.

229
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,872
Oh, shit. Yeah. What's up, dog?

230
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,045
Come on, you gotta admit it.
l'm as pretty as new money, right?

231
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,842
You look like Tony Montana on crack.

232
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,747
Yeah. Well, you would know.

233
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,216
-What's up?
-Happy birthday.

234
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,481
Thank you very much.

Very nice. Very nice. Let's drink.

Oh, shit. You know what time it is?

238
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,429
lt's time for some more Cristal
in this bitch.

239
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,770
Happy birthday toast
to the birthday boy.

240
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,156
So, basically, what's your flavor?

241
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:03,234
You know, you like vanilla,
chocolate, mocha? Some swirl?

242
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,665
No plastic.

243
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,361
-No plastic.
-Oh, okay.

244
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,007
All right. Brothers like
some genuine junk in the trunk.

245
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,074
l know, l know.

246

Carmen.

248

Don't you pretend
you don't know me. lt's me.

249
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,210
You know, excuse me,
Benjamin Franklin?

250
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,857
You know, come on.
See, my associate over here...

251
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,423
...he ain't never been to Cuba.

252
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,528
Why don't you take him
all the way to C-U-B-A?

253
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,298
Everybody hold their positions.

Sit, sit, sit. Please.

308
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,034
You gotta teach your pet Jew boy
some manners.

309
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,001
Now, l showed you mine.

Four cases, 1 00 per crate.

For old times' sake.

328

Yeah, that's a good idea.
No problem.

Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

Who is that?
Whose fucking red Mustang is that?

Take the Thompson Street over-ramp
and block the exit.

We'll get him from behind.

No hospitals. No hospitals.

Bring me a towel
with some hot water on it.

And don't forget the soap.
Bring the soap.

lt's showtime.

396
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,754
You should be a nurse, girl.

397
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,987
What? And leave my good-paying job
as a stripper?

398
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,793
My mother was a nurse
in Puerto Rico. Minimum wage.

Heal, heal, by the butt of a frog.

402

lf it doesn't heal today,
it'll heal tomorrow.

Try it. lt's good luck.

404
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:52,218
Okay, well, now that
you're all bandaged up...

405
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,159
...l should let you rest.

406
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,464
Yeah, we both should.
lt's a good idea.

407

Come lay down next to me.

408

Look. As much shit
as l've done in my life...

...l've never housed a woman
for some pussy.

And l don't plan on starting now.

-You got a lot of game, huh?
-l was referring to the lip-gloss.

416
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,710
So how long are you gonna
hold me hostage?

417
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,115
Good question.

418

when l was in junior high.

458
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,549
But sometimes rats get hungry.

459
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,262
<i>-What the fuck?</i>
-Stop the tape.

460
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,337
-l think she's dead, Walter.
-You're shitting me.

461
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:55,069
-l can't find a pulse.
-Fucking Jesus-fucking-Christ.

462
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,013
Okay, get away from-- Get a--

463
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,910
Gee, she's probably got
that bird-flu thing.

464
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,918
Yeah, sure.

465
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,925
-Check that out.
-What is it?

466
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,565
Bitch had a fucking heart condition,
is what it is.

467
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,731
l suppose that's my fault.

468
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,770
None of my picks
ever dropped dead on us.

469
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,410
So all of a sudden
you're the health expert.

470
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:31,503
You can tell if someone walking
down the street has a heart condition.

471
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,240
Look, you gonna help me with this?

472
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,389
You were sleeping.
What are you doing?

473
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,294
-What the fuck is all this purple shit?
-The security dye in with the money.

474
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,402
-How would l know that was in there?
-Why are you rummaging...

475
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,402
-...through people's shit?
-People? Nigga, what people?

476
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,474
l don't see people. You held me
hostage at gunpoint...

477
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,942
-...and nearly tried to rape me.
-Rape you? l don't even want you.

478
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,817
Okay. What about, ''Oh, take off all
your clothes and lie down with me''?

479
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:11,484
Would you-- Look at this shit,
would you? Look at this shit. Look.

480
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,247
You need to buy me a new fur.

481
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,290
lf you don't get that fake shit
out of my face....

482
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:26,702
Man. That money
was our bargaining chip.

483
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:31,364
Bargaining chip? Look, whatever.
All l know, there's another briefcase.

484
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,710
lf that briefcase is full of money,
just break me off my share...

485
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:38,348
...for of all of my troubles,
and l'll be on my merry freaking way.

486
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,574
What is wrong with you?
lt's an identical case.

487
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,616
There's a security device
in that one too.

488
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,812
You need a special tool to de-rig it.

489
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,818
Fuck.

490
00:38:55,466 --> 00:39:00,961
You know what? That's a good idea.
You wanna bounce, just leave. Take--

491
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,163
So wait. You get to keep
it all for yourself.

492
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,808
What story am l
supposed to believe?

493
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,050
l'm sorry.

494
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,604
Mommy, he's purple
like Lord Krishna.

495
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,978
The old-man mask is $ 7.99.

496
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,383
And l'm gonna need
to price-check that.

497
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,615
-Can't l just wear it?
-Sure.

498
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,952
After you take it off and pay for it.

499
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:10,763
Matt? l'm gonna need a price check
on the old-lady mask.

500
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,000
Price check on three.

501
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:22,945
Still waiting on a price check on three
on an old-lady mask.

502
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,581
lt's a dye. lt's not gonna
come off the money. That's the point.

503
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,923
Oh, hell no. l'm gonna clean
this bitch off and l'm gonna spend it.

504
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,727
Shit. Why does this shit
always happen to me?

505
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,131
And l just got my hair done.

506
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,704
-Turn around.
-Why?

507
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,570
So l can do your back, okay?

508
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,611
Be gentle, please.

509
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,815
Here, <i>café con leche</i>.

510
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,853
Prick.

511
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:25,247
-Who's gonna pay for all this?
-Money was rigged.

512
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:30,880
Come over here. Look at this tub.
Who's gonna clean that?

513
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:38,152
Yeah. For what?

514
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,688
Yeah, tell him l'm on my way.

515
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:47,470
-Captain wants to see me.
-l'm talking to you. Come over here.

516
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,161
Look at the tub.

517
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:55,776
These little Mad Cow burgers
are the bomb.

518
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,210
Excuse me.

519
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,482
Did you blow one? Oh, shit.

520
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,753
You're the one who paid $60
to stick your face in my ass.

521
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,693
l should have gave you incense
and stuck that up your ass.

522
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,130
-Protected the crime scene.
-Like you never fart.

523
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,859
Shit, l don't fart like that.

524
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,265
These are good,
but Mickey D's fries are better...

525
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,670
...because they fry them in some
crazy beef or silicone or something.

526
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,212
For real.
Did you see that flick on it?

527
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,574
Yeah, <i>Super Size Me</i>.

528
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,879
Listen to that harmony. Listen.

529
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,263
Excuse me. This is my car.
That's my demo. This is my world.

530
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,437
Look, if l'm delaying you
from your pursuit of happiness...

531
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,936
...fame, fortune and your meeting
with Puffy, fine.

532
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,735
You and your demo
can bounce, all right?

533
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,640
l mean, l'll de-rig the money
and l'll send you some of it.

534
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,337
Oh, you'll send me some of it.
Please, you're cheap.

535
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,710
-l saw you tip the waitress.
-l'm ch--? l'm broke.

536
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,682
Yes. No, you're cheap.
l wouldn't trust you to send me shit.

537
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:14,881
So you wanna go solo? All right, cool.
Then option A...

538
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,754
...de-rig the other briefcase
and break me off some hush money.

539
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,591
Or option B,
l don't know, maybe l could...

540
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,063
...run to the nearest
police station and say:

541
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,771
''l just saw this black man
and he was running with a briefcase...

542
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,874
...because he robbed a bank
and he went that way.''

543
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,211
We've got to find a closer place.

544
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,748
Sure. Why don't we just stick them
under the floorboards like Gacy?

545
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,080
Like if they ever came to the house
there wouldn't be enough evidence.

546
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,087
A tape doesn't prove anything.
How does anyone know what's real?

547
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,350
Have you heard of DNA?

548
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,154
You don't think they'd find
a spot of blood somewhere?

549
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,430
We're bonded for life, pretty boy.

550
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,147
-You hungry?
-The diner?

551
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,549
-Oh, let's go get cleaned up.
-Yeah.

552
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,615
-Franklin's here, sir. He's clean.
-Cool.

553
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,091
You finish up with
our friends at Homeland Security.

554
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,558
Okay.

555
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,638
Hey, Frankie!

556
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,810
What's up, player?

557
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,385
-Did you read the paper today?
-No.

558
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,851
Some crazy shit, man.

559
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,422
They got an article...

560
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,992
...about high school kids
having oral sex like it ain't nothing.

561
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,187
Like kissing used to be.
You got a daughter, right?

562
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,263
-Yeah.
-How old's your baby?

563
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,698
-She's 1 4.
-Mine's 1 3.

564
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:12,467
Statistically, what the trip is,
it's the white kids from suburbia.

565
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:16,043
They're more into the oral sex.
Blacks, Latinos, Asians are all fucking.

566
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:20,774
But the white kids got them beat,
per capita, on blowjobs.

567
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,150
You think l'm fucking with you, huh?

568
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,989
Check it out.
Right there for yourself.

569
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:35,521
Right under the article
on the dirty cops.

570
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,199
Yeah, another
Rodney King-type shit.

571
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,529
They got some knucklehead cops...

572
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,174
...beating up inmates and
taking their jewelry, man.

573
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,366
Now, who wants some pimpy shit
like that anyway? Am l right?

574
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,307
But you know how it is, man.

575
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,544
Dirty cops anywhere kind of....

576
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,451
Kind of makes us all
look bad, don't it?

577
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,625
Captain, l can explain.

578
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,758
l'm not an idealist.

579
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,431
l know we put our lives
on the line daily for inadequate pay.

580
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:19,007
Criminals make more in a month
than we will in a whole damn year.

581
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,406
So the temptation's always gonna
be there to say:

582
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:28,518
''Fuck it. Let me augment
my retirement fund a little bit.''

583
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,217
-But you took it to a new level.
-There's a miscommunication.

584
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,448
-That money was used strictly for--
-Motherfucker, please.

585
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,490
You took the money
from the evidence room.

586
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,855
You set up a deal
to buy some contraband.

587
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,928
When the deal goes down,
you bust them.

588
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,862
And you put the money back
before anyone knows the difference.

589
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,593
You sell the contraband
or you keep it.

590
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,966
That shit ain't original.

591
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,335
Only difference was,
this time l rigged the money.

592
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,512
And apparently, this time, you lost it.

593
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,110
So why am l out here instead of
an lAD review board?

594
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,954
Like l said...

595
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:13,025
...dirty cops anywhere
make it hard for all of us.

596
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,521
l'm prepared to offer you an out.

597
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,494
-l'm listening.
-Good. One...

598
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,729
...you write up a report
on the busted sting.

599
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,172
You take the hit on the lost money,
l sign off on it.

600
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,346
Two, l want all those Berettas
put in the evidence room.

601
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,640
l don't want that shit on the street.
Three...

602
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,444
...you and your cockroach friends
submit your resignations...

603
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,212
...which l will accept,
effective immediately.

604
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,391
And you will retire
with your pensions intact.

605
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,287
Lastly, Lee.

606
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,499
Detective Lee goes with you
right now.

607
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,430
You hand over
any surveillance tapes...

608
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,070
...audio or visual,
that have Lucky on them.

609
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,763
-Lucky?
-Lucky.

610
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,466
You forget you ever saw his ass.

611
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,504
Lucky's my problem now.

612
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,183
All the tsunamis,
earthquakes, floods.

613
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,216
Man is a virus
and God is finished with us.

614
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,648
Bullshit.

615
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,052
We're the ones raising temperatures
with greenhouse gases, not God.

616
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,420
That's why we got more
category-five hurricanes now.

617
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,687
lt's so much bigger than that, babe.

618
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,366
-l'm a serial killer!
-So are we.

619
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,661
-You go trick-or-treating, now.
-Bye.

620
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,137
All right.

621
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,237
lf l could get you
the New York fight back...

622
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:38,240
-...would you make a deal with me?
-What's the deal?

623
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:43,912
lf you win, you win.
And if you lose, you quit.

624
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,491
Go sit down, honey.

625
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,560
Order some vegetarian to go
for Eugene. l'm gonna wash up.

626
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,461
ln this world of plagues
and killer bird flus...

627
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,263
...you find being
hygienically conscious amusing?

628
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,598
-Hey, you go when you go.
-Look at you.

629
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:08,210
Always with the fingers in the face.
Spreading germs. lt's disgusting.

630
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,711
<i>Eugene was always special.</i>
<i>His father couldn't handle it.</i>

631
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,113
<i>Left before his fifth birthday.</i>
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

632
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,481
<i>Wait for Mr. Perfect?</i>

633
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:23,225
<i>Wait for someone to rescue me</i>
<i>and my son? Life didn't give rebates.</i>

634
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:28,091
l gotta get some food in me.
l got this low-blood-sugar thing.

635
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:31,463
All that psychosomatic shit.
l don't believe in all of that.

636
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,599
Like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
and all that.

637
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,671
-Hey. l know a guy who died of that.
-Yeah, right.

638
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,740
Nobody's ever died
of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

639
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,435
He couldn't even get out of bed to eat.
lt was really sad.

640
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,349
-Must have been a white guy.
-Yeah, so what?

641
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,849
White people got a lot of free time
on their hands.

642
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,817
Black people, we ain't got time
for all that shit.

643
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,888
Okay, Dr. Phil,
so, what about Latinos?

644
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,961
Mi madre <i>always said there are</i>
<i>three kinds of people in this world:</i>

645
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,130
<i>People who watch things happen...</i>

646
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,663
<i>...people who complain about</i>
<i>things that happen...</i>

647
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,495
<i>...and people who</i>
<i>make things happen.</i>

648
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,228
<i>I got a lot I wanna do in my life.</i>

649
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,703
<i>I think men just slow you down.</i>

650
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,172
-Where's the bathroom?
-Through there, to the right.

651
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,039
Great. Catch up.

652
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,211
You got the salt and pepper?
Ketchup?

653
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,412
Look at this guy. Look at this guy.

654
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,983
Hey, hey!

655
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,395
Stay right there.

656
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,793
Good afternoon.

657
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,067
-You trying to run out on the check?
-No, no, no.

658
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,761
Waitressing is tough enough
without having to pick up--

659
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,237
-Hold him right there, officer.
-What are you doing?

660
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,933
This man has been trying to run out
since l got pregnant.

661
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,306
And l know it's his,
no matter what he says.

662
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,950
l haven't even been with another man
since last my period. Not even one.

663
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,585
l saw him exiting the back door
of the restaurant, okay?

664
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,550
l thought he was
running out on his bill.

665
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,188
-Me?
-We haven't even ordered yet.

666
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,551
And you know l'm starving.
l'm eating for two.

667
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:06,195
-You enjoy your lunch.
-Hey, thanks a lot.

668
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,094
Hey, we gotta roll.

669
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,660
You want me
to quit fighting for good.

670
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,438
-For us.
-No, l can't promise that.

671
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,942
-Where you going?
-Why don't you just pay up?

672
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,345
l'm gonna go outside...

673
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,455
...and l'm gonna make
a couple phone calls...

674
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,387
...and l'm gonna see
what l can scam up.

675
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,826
That was truly fucked up.
You were just gonna leave me here?

676
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,697
-Look, you were better off without me.
-l just saved your ass.

677
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,073
Look, from now on-- From now on...

678
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,732
...you gotta do exactly
what l tell you to do. Okay?

679
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,005
No more clowning around.

680
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,373
Feel me?

681
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:07,085
l'm gonna call a friend of mine.
He owes me.

682
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,417
See if he'll let us
stay at one of his cribs...

683
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,821
...lay low for a little while.

What, what, what? Come on, man.
Just do a scene with her.

You do it for free anyway,

-Head back.
-ls that better?

752

Shake your head a little.
That's it, shake your head!

00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,116
-Eva Mendes.
-Oh, my God. Gorgeous Latina.

758
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:04,809
And then the one with
the <i>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i> kid.

759
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,283
-What's his name?
-Will Smith.

760
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,957
Yes, yes, yes. They put in
the same Latina with him.

761
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:13,095
And then the <i>Catwoman</i> with--
l know this one. l know this one.

762
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,865
Benjamin Bratt.

763
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,927
He put fine in fine.

764
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:24,197
You put a black guy with a black girl,
what you got? Black movie.

765
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,500
White with white?
Been there, done that.

766
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,803
You gotta mix it up. Make it sexy.

767
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:33,039
You know, we all fantasize
about the other, right?

768
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,945
-All right, cut.
-Antonio. Antonio, come here, quick!

769
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,450
Quick, quick.
Antonio, picture, picture, picture.

770
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,555
Picture. Look in the camera.

771
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:44,591
Okay? You got it?
Okay, get the fuck out.

772
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,659
Latinos are safe, you see.

773
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:53,131
White folks love us,
black folks live next door to us.

774
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,763
Who wouldn't wanna bang
a hot Latina?

775
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,803
Unless, of course, you was
a fag like me.

776
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,975
Hey, hey, hey, look.
Mendez, Mendez. Hey.

777
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,473
l need a car, man.

778
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,112
l need a car and l need a place
where we can hole up.

779
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,680
Do l owe you or do you owe me?

780
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,116
l'm-- l'm just fucking with you, okay?

781
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,778
Look, what are you,
her protector now? She can't speak?

782
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:15,751
-Come here, come here.
-Hey.

783
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,052
Come here. Please!

784
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,623
l got a guy in there, <i>mamita</i>.

785
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,262
An actor's an actor. Come on,
act like you're enjoying yourselves.

786
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:33,875
Look, honestly...

787
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,737
...l can't do anything today
that l won't be proud of tomorrow.

788
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,376
-Did you hear that shit?
-Yes, girl.

789
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,845
Do you believe that shit?

790
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,019
l didn't know they still
make girls like this!

791
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,121
You gotta keep her here, Lucky.
Keep her, okay?

792
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,520
Sherman, how's the transmission
on the old Eldorado?

793
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:54,094
lt's fine. You deaf prick,
go get the keys to the Eldo-- Go!

794
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,232
Go get the keys.
And to the country place too.

795
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,594
l got just the spot for you, okay?

796
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,497
lt used to belong
to my wife's mother...

797
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,865
...back then
when l still needed a wife.

798
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,906
Look, when you get back,
do me a favor, okay?

799
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,238
l want you to consider
letting me be her manager.

800
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,936
l'll take 1 0 percent. Legit.

801
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:15,481
And you're never gonna have to worry
about me trying to get into your pants.

802
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:16,913
Keys!

803
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,352
-Ain't that the truth, Lucky?
-That's the truth.

804
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,225
Antonio?

805
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,774
Roland? You okay?

806
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,312
Baby, you're not even--
You're not even tied up.

807
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:52,147
Come on. Hey, untie me, okay?

808
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,884
Listen to me.
They tossed my handbag in here...

809
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,353
...when they brought us in.

810
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,925
You remember the pepper spray
that you gave me?

811
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,187
Remember the pepper spray?
l still have it.

812
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,593
-That's my superhero.
-lf we're gonna fucking die...

813
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,395
...let's just let it be
on our own terms, okay?

814
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,740
-Hey, hey. Who you calling?
-What, are you my man now?

815
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,609
l gotta pee.

816
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,944
Well, l guess you better
roll the window down...

817
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,916
...and back your ass up to the crack
and piss out the window.

818
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,717
l don't see any toilets,
and l ain't stopping.

819
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,957
<i>Roland, you just gotta untie me.</i>

820
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:41,262
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry. I've never been</i>
<i>strong enough for you.</i>

821
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,996
<i>No, you are strong enough.</i>

822
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,066
<i>Please, just untie me.</i>

823
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,675
<i>Okay? You remember</i>
<i>the pepper spray that you gave me?</i>

824
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,506
<i>Remember the pepper spray?</i>
<i>I still have it.</i>

825
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,642
Pepper spray. That's original.

826
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:01,417
Still, you have to give her points
for spunk.

827
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,598
Crazy motherfuckers.

828
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,976
Stop! No!

829
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,410
Stop.

830
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,388
l gotta pee. You've gotta stop the car.
l gotta pee really bad.

831
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:42,223
l gotta pee, l'm serious.
Please, stop the car. l gotta pee.

832
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,964
All right.

833
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,293
l'm gonna pee all over the car
in a second.

834
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,198
Please, stop the car.
Just stop the car.

835
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,340
-You gonna be real chilly if--
-Stop the car. Stop the car, please.

836
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,032
l gotta pee.

837
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,777
Oh, God.

838
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,421
Don't look.

839
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,669
<i>You've reached Solly Sol, the man.</i>

840
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:29,504
<i>Time is money,</i>
<i>so make it quick, money.</i>

841
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,287
Yeah.

842
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,190
A friend of yours
just came by to visit.

843
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:51,833
-Who might that be?
-Lucky and his new girlfriend.

844
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,093
What a doll.

845
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,335
-No more cell phone.
-What the fuck?

846
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:03,808
GPS. Could be tracking us.

847
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,646
From now on, we going off grid.
They wanna track us...

848
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,612
...they can track that shit
up to Canada.

849
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,718
Thank you, folks, for coming.

850
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,582
All the ballistics at the strip club
have been accounted for.

851
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,055
-Meaning what?
-lt seems Lucky didn't shoot anybody.

852
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,751
Not yet anyway.
What about the Canadian border?

853
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,658
They didn't show.
Neither did the girl.

854
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:27,193
-lt's got mayonnaise in it, man.
-l told those jokers you wanted soy.

855
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,428
Well, check it out next time,
will you? Shit.

856
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,971
-What about Franklin?
-Still tracking his every move.

857
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:35,167
-Hey, can l have your sandwich?
-Yeah, yeah. Knock yourself out.

858
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:39,613
l think l better
change your bandage, Kojak.

859
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,840
Bandage is fine.

860
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,548
You was fucking Sol, wasn't you?

861
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:49,384
-Say what?
-You was boning him, right?

862
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,953
That night, you was supposed
to be the getaway driver, wasn't you?

863
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:57,064
No. We didn't need a getaway
until you fucked things up.

864
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:01,168
l didn't fuck things up. The whole
scenario was a setup. Sol was a fink.

865
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,464
Gino was in with the cops, and they
was running the shake-and-take.

866
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,968
Don't worry about
Sol returning your phone calls.

867
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,738
-What?
-They popped him. He's dead.

868
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,125
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

869
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:29,363
Sometimes in life, it seems like
if you don't have bad luck...

870
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:33,925
-...you don't have no luck at all.
-No.

871
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:38,470
No, l did not sleep with Sol and no.

872
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:43,111
-Whatever. lt don't matter.
-What? No, it matters to me.

873
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:46,244
l know that you think
because l'm a stripper...

874
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,646
...that l sleep with everybody,
but that's not the case.

875
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,878
-Sol was just an acquaintance.
-Or just a friend, right?

876
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,887
Yes. l mean, you know, he gave me
paper every now and then...

877
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,856
...but to tell the truth,
he was more intent on impressing you.

878
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,292
He used to say
that you were a true player.

879
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:05,194
You know, an original gangster.

880
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,066
Original gangster. Player.

881
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,741
Well, the frog's in a well,
and rat's in a cage.

882
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,169
What does that mean?

883
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,041
lt means all of these
player gangsters out here...

884
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,376
...they get so caught up
in their own fantasy...

885
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,112
...that they can't see the real picture.
See, they think they running shit.

886
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,847
They ain't running shit.
More likely they running in shit.

887
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,151
They just can't smell it though.

888
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:36,559
Look, l did things. l was grimy.
l hustled, l scrambled, l did all of that.

889
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,561
At one point l thought
the world was mine.

890
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:44,035
And then l realized,
oh, man, l got caught in a trick.

891
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,199
Trick had me killing my own people,
killing myself.

892
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,046
Probably killed more black people
than the Ku Klux Klan.

893
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,975
So you're trying to find
your way out of hell.

894
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,849
l can't find my way out of shit.

895
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,652
And anybody who follows me
is foolish.

896
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,429
lncluding you.

897
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:40,023
<i>And now authorities are offering</i>
<i>a $200,000 reward for the capture...</i>

898
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,129
<i>-...of the Sawtooth Killers.</i>
-Just pick one.

899
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,841
Fuck you. Life's too short to be evil.

900
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,210
Wait up, bitch! Shit.

901
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,917
-How much further?
-How the hell should l know?

902
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,147
Probably could have been there if you
hadn't given the damn car a seizure.

903
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,193
What? What?

904
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,186
Put that shit away.

905
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:50,659
My ankle.

906
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,364
-Can you come help me, please?
-l told you about them cute-ass shoes.

01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,105
Just help me up, please.

908
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:05,538
-You can't walk at all?
-No.

909
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,350
Damn. Come on.

910
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,815
-Oh, wait.
-Here.

911
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,185
-Here, you hold this.
-Okay.

01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,156

913
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,287
Damn.

914

Keep going. Come on.

916
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,540
-You hear something?
-Like what?

917
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,713
l thought l heard something.

918
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,216
Maybe it's nothing.

919
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,516
Don't start freaking me out, Lucky.

920
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,950
Seriously, l don't like
that <i>Blair Witch-</i>type shit.

921
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,556
Yeah, but l bet you like biscuits.

922
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,535
lt's gotta be around here somewhere.

923
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,202
Here, l see something.

924
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,777
l think....

925
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:22,385
-l think this is it.
-You're kidding, right?

926
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,624
Look, you just stay here, all right?
l'm gonna go check things out.

927
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,629
Wait, Lucky. Seriously,
this doesn't feel right.

928
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,412
Damn. No light.

929
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:56,051
Okay. l'll see if l can find a light.

930
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,591
See if that telephone works.

931
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,722
l should've left my ass in Jersey.

932
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:08,759
No, there's no dial tone.
There's no dial tone.

933
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,700
Where are you going?

934
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:13,702
Lucky.

935
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:16,571
l'm almost positive
l've seen it here before.

936
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,512
A blue van.

937
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,883
l would've called earlier,
but Fred said, ''Don't get involved.''

938
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:31,291
He's got irritable bowels.
You know how it is.

939
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:35,020
Yeah, yeah, l know how that is.
Well, Ethel, l wanna thank you.

940
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,563
You know,
you may have saved a life.

941
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,029
And, Fred, l wanna thank you too.

942
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,195
Did you hear that, Fred?
The young man said l was a lifesaver.

943
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,701
-Whose wife?
-Oh, come on.

944
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:51,674
Why is it as women get older,
their hair gets shorter...

945
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,178
...and their jewelry gets bigger?

946
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,251
-Yeah.
<i>-Yeah, captain, it's Lee</i>.

947
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:01,446
<i>-You in the field?</i>
-No, l'm in the office.

948
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,626
You wanted me to notify you when we
had any movement on Franklin.

949
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,261
-Yeah, so where is he?
<i>-North, at the old Sawtooth mill.</i>

950
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:11,331
-You're positive.
-Yeah, yeah. You want me to handle it?

951
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,865
No, no. l'll do this myself.

952
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,832
Fellas, you call me
if anything comes up.

953
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,767
-Anything, all right?
-You got it.

954
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,269
All right, tough guy.

955
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:29,881
Pull up some paper there.
l'll go out and get the firewood.

956
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,257
Leave the lamp.

957
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,629
Oh, and the briefcase too.

958
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,175
Humor me?

959
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:45,751
l always wanted
to go sledding as a kid.

960
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,427
Rosebud.

961
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,068
-Like in <i>Citizen Kane</i>?
-Who?

962
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,738
Forget it.

963
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,367
Okay.

964
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,108
-Put the paper in first.
-No, you put the wood in first.

965
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:12,378
-No, no. You put the paper in first.
-No, the wood.

966
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,387
Dumb black guy don't know shit.

967
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:19,424
-What?
-Exactly.

968
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:23,189
So don't go acting all high and mighty
just because you saw a couple of films.

969
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,061
l'm bilingual.
You're just <i>uno</i> Ebonical.

970
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:44,312
Okay. See, keep it up, l'm not gonna
let you sleep with me tonight.

971
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,489
That's fucked up. You're trying
to scare your way into some pussy.

972
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,591
On the contrary, baby.
l don't want none.

973
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,695
-Oh, really?
-Oh, really. Yeah.

974
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,525
Because you way too much drama--

975
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:21,549
Lucky?

976
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,248
Yeah, l'm looking for something
for us to eat.

977
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,860
Will you let me whup you
in some checkers later?

978
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:44,672

979
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,257
Bitch.

980
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:44,399
Bitch!

981
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,185
Okay.
You're gonna be all right, baby.

982
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,948
-l gotta get you some help.
-No, don't leave me.

983
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,647
Look, here.

984
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,353
You keep this with you.

985
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:09,958
Yeah.

986
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,632
Now, l saw a farmhouse nearby.

987
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,664
l'm gonna go there
and use their phone...

988
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,895
...call for an ambulance. Okay?

989
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,906
Lucky?

990
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,106
Yeah, l got you, baby. l got you.

991
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,606
Leave the briefcase?

992
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,683
l wanna know you're coming back.

993
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,648
Of course l'm coming back.
Of course.

994
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:42,727
But l mean,
what if somebody else shows up?

995
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,832
Then you're passed out
and then the money....

996
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,563
Come on. Well, l think l'll....

997
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,132
-l'll hide it somewhere.
-Please?

998
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,407
Okay. Okay.

999
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:01,778
l'll be back.

1000
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,623
You just said, ''The ass of a rat.''

1001
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,229
You teach me later.

1002
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,831
Don't go nowhere.

1003
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,659
Babe, l'll tell you what.

1004
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,861
You can fuck her first.

1005
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,097
Really?

1006
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,893
Flip for it?

1007
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:30,866
No.

1008
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,231
l'm in a watching kind of mood.

1009
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,967
Then you can have the first cut.

1010
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,469
Deal.

1011
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:07,236
Just imagine the worst possible things
you can imagine.

1012
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,745
When we're done, you're gonna know
how poor your imagination really is.

1013
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,054
Shit. Hey, babe? Babe?

1014
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,422
-What?
-We gotta deal with this.

1015
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,302
Eugene's blasting the TV. This joker's
gonna know someone's home.

1016
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,136
Don't people know any better...

1017
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,831
...than to just drop in like that?

1018
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,246
Please. l'm so sorry to bother you.

1019
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,816
We just had an accident in my place
across the way and the phone's out.

1020
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:53,214
Could you call
an ambulance for us?

1021
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:57,783
l thought that belonged
to that mobster. Mendez?

1022
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,827
Really?

1023
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,657
Well, he just let us borrow it
for a while.

1024
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,389
l really need your help.

1025
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,625
Come on in.

1026
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:10,270
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1027
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,201
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1028
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:14,135
Have a seat.

1029
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:17,004
-Would you like a cookie or some tea?
-No, thank you.

1030
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,305
-l'm kind of in a hurry.
-Of course.

1031
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:21,141
l'll get the phone right away.

1032
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:25,111
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you out of your fricking mind?

1033
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,481
Go with me on this one, Walter.

1034
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:34,058
Lee, l passed the Sawtooth mill
twice, man. What the fuck?

1035
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,490
<i>I-- I don't know, captain.</i>

1036
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:37,187
<i>Franklin's truck's gotta be there.</i>

1037
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:38,957
<i>GPS says you're</i>
<i>right on top of him.</i>

1038
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:45,434
Thank you.

1039
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,108
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

1040
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,175
l really appreciate this.

1041
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,852
This is not working.

1042
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,317
That would be
because l disconnected it.

1043
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:09,424
Now, this l do not understand.

1044
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,241
Police. Put your gun down.

1045
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:25,435
Put the shit down!

1046
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,611
Where's Lucky?

1047
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,723
Probably in Mexico by now.

1048
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:40,858
<i>First...</i>

1049
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,689
<i>...there was a note.</i>

1050
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,099
<i>Then there is no note.</i>

1051
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,430
What the fuck is going on?

1052
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:52,633
<i>They killed Roland.</i>

1053
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:57,238
-They can hear everything you say.
<i>-All in your mind.</i>

1054
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,312
<i>Good.</i>

1055
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,239
<i>Because I have had</i>
<i>a bad fucking day.</i>

1056
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:06,248
<i>And all these motherfuckers</i>
<i>are gonna do is keep pissing me off.</i>

1057
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:08,888
<i>-Illusion.</i>
-There's never a need for name-calling.

1058
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,388
What is meant to be is meant to be.

1059
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,458
<i>We're all the children</i>...

1060
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,289
<i>...of the universe.</i>

1061

<i>Breathe deeply.</i>

1062
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,403
They set us up to escape
and they just came right in...

1063
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,576
...and they slit his throat.
He's a fighter.

1064
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,678
We were supposed to go to New York.
And they just killed him.

1065
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,407
<i>Hey, hey. Look. You're gonna have to</i>
<i>keep it together now, all right?</i>

1066
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:38,175
<i>Just keep it together.</i>
<i>Hold it together.</i>

1067
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:09,679
Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

1068
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:11,351
That's right.
Turn up, look at me.

1069
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,786
How you doing, black?
What's up, man?

1070
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,183
What's going on?

1071
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:17,153
Oh, you looking--
What? What?

1072
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,293
What? Don't you know
what time it is, bro?

1073
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:23,021
l don't think you know what time it is!
Don't you know what time it is?

1074
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,028
lt's showtime, motherfuckers!

1075
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,292
Your loss.

1076
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:40,642
What the fuck is this?

1077
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,248
Hey, hey, hey.
Are we in Mexico?

1078
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,732
Man, if you want an audition...

1079
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:11,639
...l can get you audition
in WWF or something, man.

1080
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:13,973
You need to let me go, man.

1081
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,420
Two points!

1082
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:42,942
You're not turning your punches.

1083
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,709
Stop tape!

1084
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,578
What are you talking about?

1085
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:00,254
You're not pronating your punches.

1086
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,557
Listen, man.

1087
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:05,891
l've studied martial arts
for 1 7 years.

1088
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,763
So don't you fucking
criticize my technique, okay?

1089
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,802
Always with a guy tied to a chair?

1090
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:16,075
Oh, yeah. So l suppose
you want me to let you go, right?

1091
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,972
lf you were a man, you'd untie him.

1092
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:19,908
Oh, shit!

1093
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,640
Bill is back in the game!
Check that out, Cass.

1094
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,443
That's so cute.

1095
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,221
Where are we going?

1096
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,084
l'm getting you to a hospital.

1097
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,260
That fucker said
he was going to get help.

1098
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,019
He left me.

1099
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:37,595
No, haven't l tried?
Have we done that before?

1100
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,289
You know, it's cool because....

1101
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:45,773
lf l can get him to knock this chair over
one more time...

1102
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:49,136
...l can be free
out of this motherfucker.

1103
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,940
-No. No, they will not.
-Oh, yes, they will.

1104
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:09,492
l was saying....

1105
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:12,792
Hey, look. Before you introduce me
to Mr. Pinkie there...

1106
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:15,629
...l don't suppose
l could interest you in a...

1107
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,497
...suitcase full of money, could l?

1108
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:21,938
Well, l guess not.

1109
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,441
You wouldn't be interested
in the money...

1110
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,841
...seeing how you and your friend
get your kicks.

1111
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:31,178
Coupled with the fact that a suitcase
full of money and a black man....

1112
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:34,355
Yeah, it's highly likely that there'd be
a strong police presence.

1113
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,552
-ln the not-too-distant future.
-lgnore him, babe.

1114
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,193
Yeah, yeah.

1115
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:43,420
Why don't you let Bruce Lee Light
call all the shots?

1116
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:48,034
Do not provoke me.

1117
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,635
Look...

1118
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,569
...l got a shitload of money
in a suitcase.

1119
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:55,333
l stashed it in a pickup truck.

1120
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:56,669
Cut, cut, cut!

1121
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,108
What is the first fucking rule?

1122
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:01,179
Do not let these tricks
get to you, babe!

1123
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,679
Don't talk to me like that.

1124
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:05,248
And they've got all those dead cars
out there anyway.

1125
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:08,047
Yeah, yeah, Bruce.
What do you gotta lose?

1126
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:09,780
Go check.

1127
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:16,723
l'll tell you this, bro.

1128
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:19,331
You got a lot to lose, man.

1129
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,241
What are you gonna do?
Torture me?

1130
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,882
Oh, there's torture.

1131
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:40,284
And then there's torture.

1132
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:46,126
You think this is my week
away from the family?

1133
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,827
l know you but you don't know me.

1134
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,631
How many times
have we passed in the mall?

1135
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:55,826
You listen
to that gangster-rap shit...

1136
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,568
...thinking you're hard.

1137
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,406
And you,
with that little, punky hair...

1138
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,237
...always with the cruel remarks.

1139
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:09,180
''Look at the bitch
with the retarded child.'' All of you.

1140
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,949
Hurting Eugene
all the time he was a baby.

1141
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,623
But l make you pay.

1142
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:20,993
Don't l?

1143
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:24,891
Do you ever fucking learn?

1144
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:29,036
You think you know pain?

1145
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:33,932
Abu Ghraib ain't got nothing on us.

1146
01:28:34,609 --> 01:28:36,770
l'll show you pain.

1147
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,444
She's so intense.

1148
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,315
Hey. What about the money?

1149
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:50,918
-Yeah, what about the money?
-The money?

1150
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,490
Yeah. Remember?

1151
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:56,121
The truck.
Five minutes away, outside?

1152
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,356
What the hell
do you expect to get in return?

1153
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,295
Well, sh-- Look.

1154
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:03,993
Hey, you let me go
and l'll get you more of it.

1155
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:08,139
How about l take the money,
kill you...

1156
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,868
...and don't worry about
if there's any more?

1157
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:14,512
Underneath the hood.

1158
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:23,222
So, what is it with you and Lucky?

1159
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:27,220
We got a little history together.

1160
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:29,725
l got time.

1161
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:33,598
Your boy, Lucky,
ruined a lot of lives.

1162
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,035
A lot of lives.

1163
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:40,531
Justice was never done.

1164
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:43,734
This time it will be.

1165
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:54,883
-Combination?
-lt's not locked.

1166
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:59,851
Oh, wait-- Wait a minute, babe.

1167
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,654
Let's get this shit on tape.

1168
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:17,200
Okay.

1169
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:28,121
-Are you ready yet?
-l'm all set, babe.

1170
01:30:35,463 --> 01:30:37,829
Holy shit, Walter. l think it's real.

1171
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:43,732
No, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1172
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,295
-You expect me to beg?
-No.

1173
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:45,197
l expect you to scream.

1174
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:00,476
-Yeah.
<i>-Lucky just called TIPS.</i>

1175
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:03,514
-What?
<i>-Yeah. He wants to speak with you.</i>

1176
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:06,482
Run a trace.
l'll try to keep him talking.

1177
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:09,348
-Put him through.
<i>-Hey, Davis.</i>

1178
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:11,548
l got something you want.

1179
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,918
No more fucking deals this time.

1180
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:15,789
The Sawtooth Killers.

1181
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:17,988
You know the Sawtooth Killers?

1182
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:21,600
Yeah. l thought that might
shut you up.

1183
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:23,563
Well, l got the motherfuckers.

1184
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:25,898
-Why should l trust you?
<i>-Why should I trust you?</i>

1185
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:28,439
Come here, you'll see for yourself.

1186
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,076
Bring an ambulance, all right?

1187
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,446
-Yeah, where are you?
<i>-Oh, man, come on.</i>

1188
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:34,547
Come on, man.
Sh-- like you don't know.

1189
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:38,345
-Lee, got that?
<i>-You won't believe it.</i>

1190
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,180
<i>-He's back where you came from.</i>
-What?

1191
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,856
<i>The old farmhouse,</i>
<i>five minutes away, north of the mill.</i>

1192
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,285
<i>-Can you get there?</i>
-Yeah.

1193
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:47,859
<i>-All right. I'll get the guys in motion.</i>
-l'm on it.

1194
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,118
About time.

1195
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:17,348
Look. The Sawtooth Killers?

1196
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,416
You wanna see?

1197
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:20,922
Right over there.

1198
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:27,129
Yeah. Right there.

1199
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:32,136
That crazy bitch. And the Mexican.

1200
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:37,272
They murdered my boyfriend.

1201
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:40,809
-They were gonna kill us next.
-Who are you?

1202
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,511
Rainn Bentley.

1203
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:45,985
This man saved my life.

1204
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,680
Look, they even filmed their shit.

1205
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:51,414
All the crazy shit they do,
they got it on tape.

1206
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:54,321
They got it caught on tape.
Right in there.

1207

-l gotta go.
-Hey.

1208
01:33:57,732 --> 01:33:59,097
Hold up.

1209
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:00,997
Think this makes things even?

1210
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,667
Look, hey, man. Look,
l got a woman l gotta go to.

1211
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:04,838
Who's that, Angela?

1212
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,335
She's outside.

1213
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:20,043
Mama!

1214
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,059
Crazy motherfucker!

1215
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,850
All right.

1216
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,663
l'll have the charges
against you dropped.

1217
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:07,324
