<i>...ain't nothing

<i>Cause and effect.</i>

4
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,002
You'll get us killed, motherfucker.

5
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,587
You get the fuck out of my car.

6
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,422
This is my car. Hell, no!

7
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,882
What are you, on crack?

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,260
Stop the fucking car!

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,597
Look, now get out and let me drive!

10
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,766
Get out!

11
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,148
Oh, yeah.
You have to go to a hospital.

12
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,406
<i>Yeah, you're wondering,
how the fuck did I get here?</i>

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,618
<i>/ made some bad choices.</i>

14
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,999
<i>If it hadn't been for prison,
I never would've met Philomene.</i>

15
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,792
Knowledge is power.

16
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,337
<i>I'm Cape Verdean.</i>

17
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,132
<i>Got me expanding my horizons.</i>

18
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>Classic falling-for-your-caseworker,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

19
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,764
<i>Philomene wasn't having it or me.</i>

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,394
<i>All I could do was read
and watch movies.</i>

21
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:46,023
<i>Anything but gangster flicks.</i>

22
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,191
<i>This shit reminded me
too much of my past.</i>

23
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,199
<i>And I was determined
to make sure my past...</i>

24
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,620
<i>...would not be my future.</i>

25
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,877
<i>You know, I worked odd jobs...</i>

26
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:11,048
<i>...and Philomene finally
took me seriously.</i>

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,178
<i>And we put what we had together,
bought a nice little place down south.</i>

28
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:20,515
<i>And as luck would have it,
she couldn't have kids.</i>

29
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,311
<i>So we got a dog.</i>

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,313
<i>She wanted to name him Lucky,</i>
<i>after me.</i>

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,275
<i>/ said, hell, no.
Give the mutt a chance.</i>

32
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,904
<i>We called him Scraps.</i>

33
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,367
<i>For a moment, I thought
my luck might have changed.</i>

34
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,911
<i>Now, ain't that a bitch?</i>

35
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:45,540
<i>All the bullets I done caught over
the years and I get diverticulitis.</i>

36
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,043
<i>They said they had to
operate right away.</i>

37
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,088
<i>Maybe luck is a matter of timing.</i>

38
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,549
<i>When I woke up...</i>

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,095
<i>... seemed like
time had run out on all of us.</i>

40
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,263
Anybody down here?

41
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,314
Shit. What the fuck is going on?

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,444
<i>At first, I thought
the rapture had come and- and-</i>

43
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>Like those end-of-the-days preachers</i>
<i>are always talking about.</i>

44
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>And J.C., he had come down
and taken everybody except me.</i>

45
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,705
Hello?

46
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,915
-Hey, come here, boy.
<i>-/ repeat:</i>

47
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,292
-Come here.
<i>-This has been a class-five hurricane.</i>

48
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,045
-Yeah, Pops.
<i>-Hurricane Katrina, class-five.</i>

49
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>Authorities are
now urging everyone...</i>

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,466
<i>...to make their way immediately</i>
<i>to the Superdome.</i>

51
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,303
Don't you trust them. Don't go.

52
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,847
Don't go.

53
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,224
<i>We are told that the
National Guard is on its way.</i>

54

<i>But we have conflicting reports
as to when that will be.</i>

55
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,733
<i>Maybe Mother Nature...</i>

56
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,863
<i>...was trying to give us
one last wake-up call.</i>

57
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,451
<i>Or...</i>

58
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>...maybe it's like my grandpa said:</i>

59
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,666
<i>"If it wasn't forbad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all."</i>

60
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,334
<i>Say, hi, Daddy.</i>

61
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,672
<i>No Philomene, no Scraps...</i>

62
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,674
<i>...no house.</i>

63

<i>Two years ago,

<i>It ain't easy being king of the city.</i>

73
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,089
I've got that book.
Holiday cheer, right here.

74
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,549
I got what you need.

75
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,967
Look, a black reindeer.

76
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,554
I got that for you. I've got watches.
I've got your Kwanzaa needs.

77
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,182
I've got your Hanukkah needs.
I've got what you need.

78
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,226
I've got the ties. I've got the coats.

79
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,311
I've got some panties.
Anybody need panties?

80
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,896
-I've got panties.
-Ain't that what's-his-name?

81
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,481
Used to run 135th Street?

Hell, no, that ain't him right there,

-That's him, son.
-He died a while back.

-You too.

You know what I'm saying?
You can see how it goes down.

All right, beautiful, right?
I've got them.

89
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,792

<i>-How's this?
</i>-Better.

91

Oh, whoa, okay, hey, hey. Cass?

92
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,243
Would you watch it with the 1K,

<i>Could you be a little louder?
I wanna go deaf, like Pete Townshend.</i>

I told you not to point it
directly at the camera.

<i>Pardon me if I'm not up to the
standards of your professionalism.</i>

96
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,965
Okay. Just pan the 650
15 degrees to the left.

97
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,383
<i>My left or camera left?</i>

No, it's always left cam-
Camera left, Cass.

99
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,889
It's not really that hard to remember.
Stage right, camera left.

100
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,058
<i>Okay.</i>

101

I can't do anything right.</i>

102

<i>Love is when you...</i>

<i>...and the fucked-up shit that you're
probably gonna do in your life...</i>

105
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,035
<i>...and every little thing
that you could possibly think...</i>

106
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,622
<i>...that would embarrass the living shit
out of you on any day of the week...</i>

107

<i>...to any other person
on the face of the universe...</i>

108
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,419
<i>...but to this one special woman.</i>

109
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,005
<i>She takes it all.</i>

110
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,799
<i>And she kisses the feet
you walk on...</i>

111
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,844
<i>... without judgement,
without anything.</i>

112
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:13,475
<i>Someone that you know that
you can shit, fuck, piss, crap, cry.</i>

113
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,186
<i>All of that, you know.
That's what love is, now.</i>

114
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,189
<i>You know, or kind of like going on
an odyssey. Know what I mean?</i>

115
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,691
<i>It's like a fantasy voyage or
something, you know?</i>

116
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,028
<i>And, like, I'm like James T. Kirk...</i>

117
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,531
<i>...and she's like Princess Leia
or something, I don't know.</i>

118
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:34,037
<i>And, like, we're going where
no couple has ever gone before.</i>

119
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,041
Hey, Lucky. Hey, man, what's up?

120
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,251
Yo, open the door. I'm coming in.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,011
-What's up, baby?
-What's up?

122
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,430
-Fo' shizzle, my nizzle.
-What's up, dog?

123
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,978
Yo, man, when you gonna
teach your man to talk?

124
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,855
-All right, man.
-Yeah, he's all right.

125
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,984
You only saying that because
you're on his payroll.

126
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,736
What you got there?

127
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,032
Well, can't have my employee of the
month rolling up to my birthday party...

128
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,827
...wearing some
Swahili-Afro-boogie bullshit.

129
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,246
Shit. I'm not your employee.

130
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,415
My bad. My top associate.

131
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,791
Got to represent, you know?

132
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,751
Better not be that
fantasy pimp shit...

133
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,754
-...that you like wearing.
-No, baby. Tasteful.

134
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,215
I got Sean John, a.k.a. P. Dizzle.

135
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,592
-It's nice.
-Well, can a brother get a thank-you?

136
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,221
"Well, yeah. Well, thank you,
my Hebrew homes."

137
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,058
Afro Hip Hop Youth Day?

138
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,935
What the fuck you do with
my printer?

139
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,896
Yo, well, just consider it like
your donation to the community.

140
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,942
Hey. Hey, the ink is expensive, man.

141
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,694
Yo, let's get to business.

142
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,281
All right. All right.

143
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,324
I got the latest
diamond-encrusted Rolex.

144
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,785
I got the new, gold, bailer necklace.

145
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,455
Don't wear that too long.
Your neck will turn green.

146
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,540
I got some sunglasses, some Rays.

147
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,667
-I got everything in here, man.
-Sol.

148
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,462
-What's up?
-Why you do this shit, man?

149
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,007
-What do you mean?
-What I mean, your family got paper.

150
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,594
Your uncle owns the jewellery store.

151
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,889
You're robbing your uncle.

152
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,351
Why you do this?
What do you do this for?

153
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,479
Why did you do it?

154
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,608
I mean, you were one of
the biggest hustlers in Harlem, man.

155
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,152
Mr. Untouchable?

156
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,072
Hey, you was poisoning
your own people.

157
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,283
-Yo.
-Yo. No offence, bro.

158
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,078
I mean, it's the American way, right?
We all want more.

159
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,247
Even Donald fucking Trump
wants more.

160
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,334
More- More power,
more money, more bling.

161
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,919
More punani.

162
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,547
Yo, listen, it's real important to me that
you be on time tonight, you know?

163
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,008
-I'll send the fellas.
-I want to talk about that.

164
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,094
-What's up?
-I'm not gonna be able to roll, man.

165
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,515
-What are you talking about, man?
-You know, that's your thing, man.

166
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,768
-I ain't-
-Oh, but it's my birthday party, man.

167
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,269
We'll have a crazy time, son.

168
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,189
Look, I got all this shit for you.
You're gonna love it, man.

169
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,857
That's you, right there.

170
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,527
-I get to wear this?
-Yes, you get to wear this.

171
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,197
I don't know, man. I don't know.

172
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,493
No, man. That's your world.

173
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,203
This is my size.

174
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,497
-He likes it, he likes it.
-Yeah, baby.

175
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,793
She starts screwing around and
has no idea whose kid she's having.

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,294
Well, that's how she sees it.

177
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,921
-Don't get knocked up.
-Excuse me.

178
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,049
-Can you help me?
-Just saying, it's not fair to the kids.

179
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,926
Got it.

180
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,137
I'm going back in for the picnic table.

181
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,681
Hey, babe. Smile for the camera.

182
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,136
-You know how we do.
-Oh, yeah.

183
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,560
So you tell them about what we're
gonna do later on. All right?

184
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,188
I think they ready, sir.

185
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,190
Oh, yeah. They ready.
You see that today?

186
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,110
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

187
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,779
Hey, look, Mr. C,
about those flyers and everything?

188
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,115
Ain't gotta worry about that.
I got that for free.

189
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,075
My man hooked me up
and everything-

190
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,994
Beautiful.

191
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,832
You'd think by now
that people would understand...

192
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,751
...that you reap what you sow.

193
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,298
Would you rather have your kids in
a dance group or a gang?

194
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,718
Dance group. Without question.

195
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,388
It seems the government's
more interested in building prisons...

196
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,265
...than investing in the kids.

197
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,894
This is gonna be our last show.

198
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,940
They've taken away our funding,
so we've gotta close the place down.

199
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,823
Yeah, I know.

200
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,494
But don't you let this unravel
all the good work you've done.

201
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,331
For this place, for these kids.

202
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,750
Most of all, for yourself.

203
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,337
You've turned your life around.

204
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,632
You stayed on the path.

205
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,970
I was really looking forward to this,
you know?

206
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,431
Really looking forward to it.

207
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,186
All right, Mr. C.

208
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,691
Good luck to you, young brother.

209
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,567
Hey, you know how we do.

210
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,363
We're in the trenches, baby.
In the trenches.

211
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,627
The bitches in this piece.

212
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,879
Sir, you're here with
the Rosenbaum's party.

213
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,381
Right this way, sir.

214
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,883
<i>Putting it down.
New Booty Room, to your right.</i>

215
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,219
<i>We got the Oom-Boom Room.</i>

216
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,390
<i>We've got lap dances for $25.</i>

217
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,975
<i>30, if you're a good tipper.</i>

218
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,560
<i>And on the stage right now...</i>

219
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,438
<i>...we got Carmen,
all the way from Cuba.</i>

220
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,231
<i>You gotta love Castro.</i>

221
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,692
<i>She swam over here for you,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

222
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,902
<i>You know what?
We gotta pay for that education.</i>

223
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,197
<i>Go in your pockets.
No food stamps. No coin.</i>

224
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,907
<i>Just stuff that folds.</i>

225
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,868
<i>Carmen putting it down for you.</i>

226
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,413
<i>Right here in The Cadillac Lounge.</i>
<i>This is DJ Big Cat.</i>

227
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,675
Yeah, go on, girl. Get triple-X with it.

228
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,093
Money to share.

229
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,930
Oh, shit. Yeah. What's up, dog?

230
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,100
Come on, you gotta admit it.
I'm as pretty as new money, right?

231
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,894
You look like Tony Montana on crack.

232
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,771
Yeah. Well, you would know.

233
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,272
-What's up?
-Happy birthday.

234
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,524
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

235
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,985
-I dressed you well. Look at you.
-Yeah, yeah.

236
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,029
Very nice. Very nice. Let's drink.

237
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,989
Oh, shit. You know what time it is?

238
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,451
It's time for some more Cristal
in this bitch.

239
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,790
Happy birthday toast
to the birthday boy.

240
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,187
So, basically, what's your flavour?

241
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:03,277
You know, you like vanilla,
chocolate, mocha? Some swirl?

242
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,696
No plastic.

243
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,407
-No plastic.
-Oh, okay.

244
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,034
All right. Brothers like
some genuine junk in the trunk.

245
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,120
I know, I know.

246
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,956
Yo.

247
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,833
Carmen.

248
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,043
Don't you pretend
you don't know me. It's me.

249
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,255
You know, excuse me,
Benjamin Franklin?

250
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,883
You know, come on.
See, my associate over here...

251
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,468
...he ain't never been to Cuba.

252
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,556
Why don't you take him
all the way to C-U-B-A?

253
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,350
Everybody hold their positions.

254
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,644
-We move on my command.
<i>-Roger that.</i>

255
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,991
<i>I'm in love with a stripper.</i>

256
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,994
<i>I'm in love with a stripper,
that's why I'm working here.</i>

257
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,997
Oh, yeah.

258
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,041
That's him right there.
In the black suit.

259
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,670
Bonus.

260
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,863
You can hold my stick too.

261
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,781
You wish.

262
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,836
I thought she liked me.

263
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:52,887
I mean, baby got ass like
a Shetland pony. Right.

264
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,431
Lucky.

265
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,102
-I want you to meet the owner.
-Why?

266
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,147
Well, you know, he's just a friend.
You know, like that.

267
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,235
No, come on, yo. It's-

268
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,112
I mean, you know,
make me look good here, you know?

269
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,740
-It's my birthday. Come on.
-Make you look good?

270
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,492
-Yeah.
-Dude--

271
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,205
I got- I got a little deal here, okay?

272
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,999
You know, I figure with you here,
you know...

273
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,919
...everything goes right, you know?
Who's gonna mess with me?

274
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,088
Mess with you?
Why don't you take your boys?

275
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,674
Oh, come on, man. Be serious.

276
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,550
Listen, Lucky, okay?

277
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,386
I'm in deep here, you know?

278
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:38,641
So, come on, just,
I'm not telling nothing, okay?

279
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,811
Please, Lucky. Come on.
You know?

280
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,688
Who's getting you
back on your feet? Me.

281
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,356
Who trusted you when
no one would?

282
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,650
Me, okay? Now help me.

283
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,695
Okay, you don't gotta say nothing
or you don't gotta do nothing.

284
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,489
Just stand there.
Just be there with me.

285
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,535
Okay? Please.
Just this once, all right?

286
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,163
-What do you say?
-Oh, man.

287
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,691
Look who it is.

288
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,693
Now I believe in reincarnation.

289
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,486
Holy shit, I thought you were dead.

290
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,614
Yeah, well, so did I.

291
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,199
Come here, man.

292
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,870
-Keeping it together?
-I am, I am, I am.

293
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,540
Gentlemen, I believe we have
some business to transact.

294
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,375
Jesus. Fifteen years?

295
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,127
-Lucky, please stay.
-Yo, man.

296
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,879
Don't let me interrupt. Handle bu-

297
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,339
-Have a seat.
-I'm just-

298
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,965
Please. Join us.

299
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,348
You need something, baby?

300
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,562
As requested.

301
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,358
250 thousand dollars.

302
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,777
Each case.

303
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,737
Hey.

304
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,532
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lucky.
Lucky, Lucky, please stay.

305
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,826
-I'm just gonna take a piss, baby.
-No, no, no.

306
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,080
You're my guest. Please. We're gonna
have a little drink here, please.

307
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,582
Sit, sit, sit. Please.

308
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,090
You gotta teach your pet Jew boy
some manners.

309
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,054
Now, I showed you mine.

310
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,434
Four cases, 100 per crate.

311
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,269
The minivan's parked out back.

312
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,940
Beretta Cheetah.

313
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,775
Magazine capacity...

314
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,610
...thirteen, as requested.

315
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,197
-Let's get out of here, man.
-What?

316
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,785
Jenny, how about some champagne?

317
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:03,953
He's a rat.

318
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,376
Let's get out of here, man. Come on.

319
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,130
Yo. Sorry, homeboy.
You know how it is.

320
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,090
Gots to get paid.

321
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,970
Everybody hold until
we confirm the goods.

322
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,805
<i>Roger.</i>

323
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,035
<i>-Yeah, the Berettas look good.
</i>-The merchandise checks out.

324
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,498
Bravo. Bravo.
Successful business transaction.

325
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,916
<i>Police! You're under arrest!</i>

326
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,252
The guest of honour
should do the honours.

327
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,753
For old times' sake.

328
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,507
Yeah, that's a good idea.
No problem.

329
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,344
You never cease to amaze me.

330
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,638
Oh, I try not to, baby.

331
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,017
-Big bailer.
-It's good to see you, my man.

332
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,477
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,854
-Back in the life.
-No, no, no. Not me.

334
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,732
-No?
-I'm just a hostess.

335
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,946
-There you go.
-Gino, why don't you go ahead?

336
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,198
Wrap up things outside.

337
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,283
Hey, hey!

338
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,872
-What the fuck you doing, man?
-What am I doing?

339
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,709
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!
He's got a fucking wire! Oh, my God!

340
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,687
<i>There comes a point in life
when you just gotta say, "Fuck it."</i>

341
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,608
<i>You gotta play the hand
that life deals you...</i>

342
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,445
<i>...and let the chips fall
where they may.</i>

343
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,991
Don't shoot!

344
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,250
Where's my fucking money?

345
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,420
Who is that?
Whose fucking red Mustang is that?

346
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,339
-The Latin chick.
-Carmen.

347
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,049
She goes by the name Carmen.

348
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,636
Telling you now, you piece of shit,
I go down, you're going down with me.

349
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,221
Move out, let's go!

350
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,640
-What the fuck is going on?
-Get on the ground.

351
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,226
-What are you, fucking crazy?
-Get down on the ground.

352
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,113
Hello? Who's there?

353
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,240
Who is it?

354
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,252
Get down. Get down.

355
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,588
Okay.

356
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,551
What are you, on crack?

357
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,140
-He's heading downtown.
<i>-I'm right behind you.</i>

358
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,615
Who is this fucking guy?

359
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,828
You'll get us killed, motherfucker.

360
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,082
Pop this fucker.

361
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,465
This is my car. Hell, no!

362
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,675
Shoot him! Shoot him!

363
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,515
<i>-Headed south on Waterman.
</i>-Cut him off at the tunnel.

364
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,100
<i>I'm three blocks away.</i>

365
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,352
Get your ass there now!

366
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,191
Stop the fucking car!

367
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,824
This fucker's out of his mind.
He went in the tunnel.

368
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,452
Take the Thompson Street over-ramp
and block the exit.

369
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,705
We'll get him from behind.

370
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,129
You need to go to a hospital.

371
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,716
Hold on.

372
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,851
Seal the exit! Seal the exit!

373
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,149
-Get there, now!
<i>-I'm right on top of you.</i>

374
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,576
Motherfucker!

375
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,168
You need to go to a hospital.

376
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:08,257
No hospitals. No hospitals.

377
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,580
Bring me a towel
with some hot water on it.

378
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,461
And don't forget the soap.
Bring the soap.

379
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,144
Look, you want me to help you,
you gotta put that thing away.

380
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:08,901
-Okay. Take your clothes off.
-Are you fucking nuts?

381
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,279
It ain't like I ain't already
seen you naked. Take your shit off.

382
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,617
Look, this way I know
you're less likely to bounce.

383
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,330
Take your shit off.

384
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,083
What, what, do you need a beat?

385
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,376
Happy?

386
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,670
Carmen.

387
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:13,549
That's your dance name, right?
What's your real name?

388
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,885
-Angela.
-Okay.

389
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:21,640
Angela, who's probably
not from Cuba, listen.

390
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,559
I have no intentions of hurting you.

391
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,979
Just don't make me
get stupid, all right? Just be cool...

392
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:31,900
...do what I say, everything will
be all right. You feel me?

393
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,695
Yeah, I feel you.

394
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,366
Here. Help me get this off.

395
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,754
It's showtime.

396
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,777
You should be a nurse, girl.

397
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,032
What? And leave my good-paying job
as a stripper?

398
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,829
My mother was a nurse
in Puerto Rico. Minimum wage.

399
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:31,585
-Do I believe this story?
-Why not? It's free.

400
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,634
Translation?

401
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,427
Heal, heal, by the butt of a frog.

402
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,721
If it doesn't heal today,
it'll heal tomorrow.

403
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,265
Try it. It's good luck.

404
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,272
Okay, well, now that
you're all bandaged up...

405
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,191
...I should let you rest.

406
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,487
Yeah, we both should.
It's a good idea.

407
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,616
Come lay down next to me.

408
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,578
Look. As much shit
as I've done in my life...

409
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,705
...I've never housed a woman
for some pussy.

410
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,250
And I don't plan on starting now.

411
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,004
Just lay down.

412
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,095
Other side. Away from the door.

413
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,227
Just humour me.

414
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,072
-What you doing?
-You want some?

415
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:53,328
-You got a lot of game, huh?
-I was referring to the lip-gloss.

416
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,753
So how long are you gonna
hold me hostage?

417
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,173
Good question.

418
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,946
Why are you doing this?

419
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,615
<i>Mama.</i>

420
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,827
Stop tape.

421
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,829
<i>Mama.</i>

423
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,709
It's your kid, babe.
I'll handle it from here.

424
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,149
-Mama.
-I'm coming, baby.

425
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,693
Mama!

426
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:18,914
Oh, honey. Here.
Let's take the mask off.

427
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,791
That's okay, baby.
We'll put it right back on.

428
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:26,213
Here. Okay. Come on.
All right. Come on.

429
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,635
That's a good boy.
Come on, sweetie.

430
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:40,977
Here. You sit down, right here.

431
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,773
Oh, yeah. It's okay.
We'll take this off just for a minute.

432
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,276
-I wanna be Spiderman.
-Oh, we'll see. We'll see.

433
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,655
I wanna go trick-or-treating.
I want candy, Mama.

434
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,783
Baby, you can't go out there.
Here are your meds.

435
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,245
Here are your meds. Take that now.
Good boy.

436
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:06,211
-Okay, that's good.
-I wanna go trick-or-treating, Mama.

437
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,380
I know, baby.
I'm- Mommy's gonna sing to you.

438
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,967
Mommy's gonna sing to you now.
Okay?

439
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:32,862
<i>/ finally get my hands on
a half a million dollars and it's wired.</i>

440

<i>She doesn't even know.</i>

444
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,389
<i>It doesn't seem fair.</i>

445
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:13,737
<i>Only one way out.
That money was our lifeline.</i>

446
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,703
-What?
-Gino.

447
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,873
It's for you.

448
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,131
-Yeah.
-Hey, look.

449
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,716
No problems, no questions.

450
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,552
Return all the money
and then everything is cool, right?

451
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,478
-Where are you?
-I'll call you back. No!

452
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,481
No.

-Are we dead?
-Yes.

454
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,425
Okay. So we have the most
wonderful thing for you tonight.

Yes.

456
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:26,017
The most beautiful little rat.

457
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,937
I had a pet rat
when I was in junior high.

458
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,607
But sometimes rats get hungry.

<i>-What the fuck?

460

-You're shitting me.

461
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:55,130
-I can't find a pulse.
-Fucking Jesus-fucking-Christ.

462
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,052
Okay, get away from- Get a—

463
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,972
Gee, she's probably got
that bird-flu thing.

464
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,974
Yeah, sure.

465
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,982
-Check that out.
-What is it?

466
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,609
Bitch had a fucking heart condition,
is what it is.

467
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,781
I suppose that's my fault.

468
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,825
None of my picks
ever dropped dead on us.

469
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,454
So all of a sudden
you're the health expert.

470
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,541
You can tell if someone walking
down the street has a heart condition.

471
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,293
Look, you gonna help me with this?

472
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,431
You were sleeping.
What are you doing?

473
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:50,351
-What the fuck is all this purple shit?
-The security dye in with the money.

474
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,438
-How would I know that was in there?
-Why are you rummaging...

475
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,441
-...through people's shit?
-People? Nigga, what people?

476
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,527
I don't see people. You held me
hostage at gunpoint...

477
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,989
-...and nearly tried to rape me.
-Rape you? I don't even want you.

478
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:07,869
Okay. What about, "Oh, take off all
your clothes and lie down with me"?

479
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,539
Would you- Look at this shit,
would you? Look at this shit. Look.

480
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,291
You need to buy me a new fur.

481
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,336
If you don't get that fake shit
out of my face....

482
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,721
Man. That money
was our bargaining chip.

483
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:31,392
Bargaining chip? Look, whatever.
All I know, there's another briefcase.

484
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,729
If that briefcase is full of money,
just break me off my share...

485
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:38,399
...for of all of my troubles,
and I'll be on my merry freaking way.

486
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,610
What is wrong with you?
It's an identical case.

487
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,654
There's a security device
in that one too.

488
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,865
You need a special tool to de-rig it.

489
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,868
Fuck.

490
00:38:55,458 --> 00:39:01,005
You know what? That's a good idea.
You wanna bounce, just leave. Take-

491
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,216
So wait. You get to keep
it all for yourself.

492
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,843
What story am I
supposed to believe?

493
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,101
I'm sorry.

494
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,625
Mommy, he's purple
like Lord Krishna.

495
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,012
The old-man mask is $7.99.

496
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,432
And I'm gonna need
to price-check that.

497
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,642
-Can't I just wear it?
-Sure.

498
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,978
After you take it off and pay for it.

499
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,825
Matt? I'm gonna need a price check
on the old-lady mask.

500
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,036
Price check on three.

501
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:23,004
Still waiting on a price check on three
on an old-lady mask.

502
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:28,635
It's a dye. It's not gonna
come off the money. That's the point.

503
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,972
Oh, hell no. I'm gonna clean
this bitch off and I'm gonna spend it.

504
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:38,770
Shit. Why does this shit
always happen to me?

505
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,189
And I just got my hair done.

506
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,733
-Turn around.
-Why?

507
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,611
So I can do your back, okay?

508
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,661
Be gentle, please.

509
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,872
Here, <i>cafe con leche.</i>

510
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,879
Prick.

511
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:25,274
-Who's gonna pay for all this?
-Money was rigged.

512
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:30,905
Come over here. Look at this tub.
Who's gonna clean that?

513
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,204
Yeah. For what?

514
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,749
Yeah, tell him I'm on my way.

515
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,505
-Captain wants to see me.
-I'm talking to you. Come over here.

516
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,215
Look at the tub.

517
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:55,805
These little Mad Cow burgers
are the bomb.

518
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,268
Excuse me.

519
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,527
Did you blow one? Oh, shit.

520
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,780
You're the one who paid $60
to stick your face in my ass.

521
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,742
I should have gave you incense
and stuck that up your ass.

522
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,161
-Protected the crime scene.
-Like you never fart.

523
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,912
Shit, I don't fart like that.

524
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,290
These are good,
but Mickey D's fries are better...

525
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,710
...because they fry them in some
crazy beef or silicone or something.

526
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,255
For real.
Did you see that flick on it?

527
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,632
Yeah, <i>Super Size Me.</i>

528
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,932
Listen to that harmony. Listen.

529
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:51,319
Excuse me. This is my car.
That's my demo. This is my world.

530
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,489
Look, if I'm delaying you
from your pursuit of happiness...

531
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,991
...fame, fortune and your meeting
with Puffy, fine.

532
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,786
You and your demo
can bounce, all right?

533
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,663
I mean, I'll de-rig the money
and I'll send you some of it.

534
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,374
Oh, you'll send me some of it.
Please, you're cheap.

535
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,752
-I saw you tip the waitress.
-I'm ch-? I'm broke.

536
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,713
Yes. No, you're cheap.
I wouldn't trust you to send me shit.

537
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,926
So you wanna go solo? All right, cool.
Then option A...

538
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,845
...de-rig the other briefcase
and break me off some hush money.

539
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,641
Or option B,
I don't know, maybe I could...

540
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,102
...run to the nearest
police station and say:

541
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,816
"I just saw this black man
and he was running with a briefcase...

542
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,401
...because he robbed a bank
and he went that way."

543
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:38,241
We've got to find a closer place.

544
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,786
Sure. Why don't we just stick them
under the floorboards like Gacy?

545
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:45,122
Like if they ever came to the house
there wouldn't be enough evidence.

546
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,126
A tape doesn't prove anything.
How does anyone know what's real?

547
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,377
Have you heard of DNA?

548
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,213
You don't think they'd find
a spot of blood somewhere?

549
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,468
We're bonded for life, pretty boy.

550
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,190
-You hungry?
-The diner?

551
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,569
-Oh, let's go get cleaned up.
-Yeah.

552
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,661
-Franklin's here, sir. He's clean.
-Cool.

553
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,122
You finish up with
our friends at Homeland Security.

554
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,582
Okay.

555
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,675
Hey, Frankie!

556
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,848
What's up, player?

557
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,438
-Did you read the paper today?
-No.

558
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,899
Some crazy shit, man.

559
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,442
They got an article...

560
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,029
...about high school kids
having oral sex like it ain't nothing.

561
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,240
Like kissing used to be.
You got a daughter, right?

562
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,284
-Yeah.
-How old's your baby?

563
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,746
-She's 14.
-Mine's 13.

564
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:12,501
Statistically, what the trip is,
it's the white kids from suburbia.

565
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,088
They're more into the oral sex.
Blacks, Latinos, Asians are all fucking.

566
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:20,801
But the white kids got them beat,
per capita, on blowjobs.

567
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,181
You think I'm fucking with you, huh?

568
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,018
Check it out.
Right there for yourself.

569
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:35,566
Right under the article
on the dirty cops.

570
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,235
Yeah, another
Rodney King-type shit.

571
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,571
They got some knucklehead cops...

572
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,200
...beating up inmates and
taking their jewellery, man.

573
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,412
Now, who wants some pimpy shit
like that anyway? Am I right?

574
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,333
But you know how it is, man.

575
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,587
Dirty cops anywhere kind of....

576
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,508
Kind of makes us all
look bad, don't it?

577
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,677
Captain, I can explain.

578
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,809
I'm not an idealist.

579
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,480
I know we put our lives
on the line daily for inadequate pay.

580
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:19,026
Criminals make more in a month
than we will in a whole damn year.

581
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,446
So the temptation's always gonna
be there to say:

582
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:28,536
"Fuck it. Let me augment
my retirement fund a little bit."

583
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,248
-But you took it to a new level.
-There's a miscommunication.

584
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:35,501
-That money was used strictly for-
-Motherfucker, please.

585
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,545
You took the money
from the evidence room.

586
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,880
You set up a deal
to buy some contraband.

587
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,966
When the deal goes down,
you bust them.

588
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,885
And you put the money back
before anyone knows the difference.

589
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,638
You sell the contraband
or you keep it.

590
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,016
That shit ain't original.

591
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,393
Only difference was,
this time I rigged the money.

592
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,563
And apparently, this time, you lost it.

593
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,155
So why am I out here instead of
an IAD review board?

594
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,993
Like I said...

595
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:13,080
...dirty cops anywhere
make it hard for all of us.

596
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,583
I'm prepared to offer you an out.

597
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,545
-I'm listening.
-Good. One...

598
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:23,758
...you write up a report
on the busted sting.

599
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,219
You take the hit on the lost money,
I sign off on it.

600
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,389
Two, I want all those Berettas
put in the evidence room.

601
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,641
I don't want that shit on the street.
Three...

602
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,478
...you and your cockroach friends
submit your resignations...

603
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,272
...which I will accept,
effective immediately.

604
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,442
And you will retire
with your pensions intact.

605
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,319
Lastly, Lee.

606
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,534
Detective Lee goes with you
right now.

607
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,453
You hand over
any surveillance tapes...

608
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,122
...audio or visual,
that have Lucky on them.

609
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,792
-Lucky?
-Lucky.

610
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,503
You forget you ever saw his ass.

611
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,547
Lucky's my problem now.

612
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,219
All the tsunamis,
earthquakes, floods.

613
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,262
Man is a virus
and God is finished with us.

614
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,680
Bullshit.

615
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:15,059
We're the ones raising temperatures
with greenhouse gases, not God.

616
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,478
That's why we got more
category-five hurricanes now.

617
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,730
It's so much bigger than that, babe.

618
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:24,401
-I'm a serial killer!
-So are we.

619
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,695
-You go trick-or-treating, now.
-Bye.

620
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,156
All right.

621
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,285
If I could get you
the New York fight back...

622
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:38,290
-...would you make a deal with me?
-What's the deal?

623
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:43,963
If you win, you win.
And if you lose, you quit.

624
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,510
Go sit down, honey.

625
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,596
Order some vegetarian to go
for Eugene. I'm gonna wash up.

626
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,519
In this world of plagues
and killer bird flus...

627
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,313
...you find being
hygienically conscious amusing?

628
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,649
-Hey, you go when you go.
-Look at you.

629
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:08,237
Always with the fingers in the face.
Spreading germs. It's disgusting.

630
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,741
<i>Eugene was always special.
His father couldn't handle it.</i>

631
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:16,162
<i>Left before his fifth birthday.
What was I supposed to do?</i>

632
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,539
<i>Wait for Mr. Perfect?</i>

633
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:23,252
<i>Wait for someone to rescue me
and my son? Life didn't give rebates.</i>

634
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:28,132
I gotta get some food in me.
I got this low-blood-sugar thing.

635
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,510
All that psychosomatic shit.
I don't believe in all of that.

636
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,637
Like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
and all that.

637
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,724
-Hey. I know a guy who died of that.
-Yeah, right.

638
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,768
Nobody's ever died
of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

639
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:43,480
He couldn't even get out of bed to eat.
It was really sad.

640
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,401
-Must have been a white guy.
-Yeah, so what?

641
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,904
White people got a lot of free time
on their hands.

642
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,865
Black people, we ain't got time
for all that shit.

643
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,909
Okay, Dr. Phil,
so, what about Latinos?

644
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,996
Mi mad re <i>always said there are
three kinds of people in this world:</i>

645
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,165
<i>People who watch things happen...</i>

646
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,709
<i>...people who complain about
things that happen...</i>

647
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,545
<i>...andpeople who
make things happen.</i>

648
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,256
<i>/ got a lot I wanna do in my life.</i>

649
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,759
<i>/ think men just slow you down.</i>

650
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,220
-Where's the bathroom?
-Through there, to the right.

651
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,096
Great. Catch up.

652
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,267
You got the salt and pepper?
Ketchup?

653
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,438
Look at this guy. Look at this guy.

654
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,028
Hey, hey!

655
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,447
Stay right there.

656
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,824
Good afternoon.

657
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,120
-You trying to run out on the check?
-No, no, no.

658
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,790
Waitressing is tough enough
without having to pick up-

659
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,292
-Hold him right there, officer.
-What are you doing?

660
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,962
This man has been trying to run out
since I got pregnant.

661
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,339
And I know it's his,
no matter what he says.

662
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,968
I haven't even been with another man
since last my period. Not even one.

663
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,637
I saw him exiting the back door
of the restaurant, okay?

664
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,597
I thought he was
running out on his bill.

665
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,224
-Me?
-We haven't even ordered yet.

666
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,601
And you know I'm starving.
I'm eating for two.

667
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,230
-You enjoy your lunch.
-Hey, thanks a lot.

668
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,149
Hey, we gotta roll.

669
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,694
You want me
to quit fighting for good.

670
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:21,495
-For us.
-No, I can't promise that.

671
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,002
-Where you going?
-Why don't you just pay up?

672
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,379
I'm gonna go outside...

673
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:33,507
...and I'm gonna make
a couple phone calls...

674
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,427
...and I'm gonna see
what I can scam up.

675
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,851
That was truly fucked up.
You were just gonna leave me here?

676
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:47,730
-Look, you were better off without me.
-I just saved your ass.

677
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:51,108
Look, from now on- From now on...

678
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,778
...you gotta do exactly
what I tell you to do. Okay?

679
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,032
No more clowning around.

680
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,409
Feel me?

681
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,124
I'm gonna call a friend of mine.
He owes me.

682
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,460
See if he'll let us
stay at one of his cribs...

683
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,879
...lay low for a little while.

684
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,089
Damn. We gotta
get rid of this car too.

685

692
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,285
I'm- I'm so sorry.
Can you repeat that, please?

693
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,872
Yep.

694
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:55,214
-Move. Move!
-Have a little respect, please!

695

Stop the van right now!

Stop the van!
Stop the fucking van right now!

697
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,597
What the fuck?
What kind of fucking shit-?

698

-I'm gonna fucking kill you! Rainn!
-What kind of fucking-?

699

I'm gonna kill you!

700
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,355
What is this, National Impulse Day
or something?

701
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,108
-Remember the time we did a couple?
-That's not the point.

Sometimes you just
have to be spontaneous.

704
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,781
I'd appreciate next time
if you'd give me a little warning.

705
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,700
I didn't even have time
for the camera.

706
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,744
I feel so fucking alive right now.

What are you gonna do to us?

709
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,386
Blue. Blue.

710
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:47,141
Blue, blue, blue is for you, miss.
True blue. Thank you very much.

711
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,893
-Blue.
-What are you gonna do to us?

712
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:55,149
Roland? Roland?

713
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,624
-So it worked out.
-Babe, when you're right, you're right.

714
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,801
I knew you'd like
that little punky girl.

715
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:31,101
-Would you wait a minute? Shit.
-You don't even know the guy.

716
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:35,481
Which is why it's fucking important
to make a good first impression.

717
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,651
-First impression, huh?
-Yes.

718
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,238
-I'm impressed.
-Whatever.

719
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,578
Who is it? Who is it?

720
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,707
Lucky's here with a guest.

721
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,885
Let me see your bag, miss.

722
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,388
Quiet.

Oh, yes.

Hot set!

726
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,402
Oh, my God.

727
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,905
Heaven has sent me an angel.

728
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,368
Since when you walking around
with a freaking Venus, Lucky?

729
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,161
-Well-
-Oh, look, she's blushing.

730
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,749
-What's your name, sweetheart?
-Angela Maria Guzmano del Lopez.

731
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,876
Angie for short.

732
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,758
That means singer.

733
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,011
-Look, Mendez-
-You have something for me?

734
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,430
That's my demo.

735
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,849
Don't touch that!

736
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,937
-This is you, honey?
-Yeah.

737
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:01,108
Sherman! Move Breakman to 4.

738
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,777
Lucky, Angie.

739
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,613
-Look, Mendez, so-
-Angie, come. Angie, come.

740
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,574
You too, Lucky, come on.
Come, come.

741
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,120
Lucky, sit. Angie, sit right here.
Sit, sit. Lucky, sit, sit, sit.

742
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,789
Don't touch that!

743
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,626
Picture, picture, picture.
Lucky, please.

744
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,962
Lucky, come on, come on, come on.

745
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,756
Okay. Lucky, don't smile.

746
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,384
Yeah! Okay, okay.

747
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,469
I'm gonna put you both
in a movie right now.

748
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,764
-I'll pay you $1000 each, cash.
-Mendez, you ain't gotta do that.

749
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,642
What, what, what? Come on, man.
Just do a scene with her.

750
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,854
You do it for free anyway,
might as well get paid, right, honey?

751
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,732
-Head back.
-Is that better?

752
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,068
Shake your head a little.
That's it, shake your head!

753
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,405
America's so fucked up
racially, right?

754
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:52,534
Latinos are the new exotic.

755
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,078
I mean, look at some of
the Hollywood pictures.

756
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,998
The dirty cop one, <i>Training Day.
</i>They put Denzel with-

757
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,168
-Eva Mendes.
-Oh, my God. Gorgeous Latina.

758
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,838
And then the one with
the <i>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </i>kid.

759
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,340
-What's his name?
-Will Smith.

760
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,009
Yes, yes, yes. They put in
the same Latina with him.

761
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:13,138
And then the <i>Catwoman </i>with-
I know this one. I know this one.

762
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,893
Benjamin Bratt.

763
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,979
He put fine in fine.

764
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,232
You put a black guy with a black girl,
what you got? Black movie.

765
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,526
White with white?
Been there, done that.

766
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,863
You gotta mix it up. Make it sexy.

767
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,075
You know, we all fantasise
about the other, right?

768
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,994
-All right, cut.
-Antonio. Antonio, come here, quick!

769
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,497
Quick, quick.
Antonio, picture, picture, picture.

770
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,582
Picture. Look in the camera.

771
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:44,628
Okay? You got it?
Okay, get the fuck out.

772
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,714
Latinos are safe, you see.

773
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:53,178
White folks love us,
black folks live next door to us.

774
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,806
Who wouldn't wanna bang
a hot Latina?

775
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,849
Unless, of course, you was
a fag like me.

776
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,018
Hey, hey, hey, look.
Mendez, Mendez. Hey.

777
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,520
I need a car, man.

778
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,147
I need a car and I need a place
where we can hole up.

779
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,733
Do I owe you or do you owe me?

780
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,153
I'm- I'm just fucking with you, okay?

781
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,824
Look, what are you,
her protector now? She can't speak?

782
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,784
-Come here, come here.
-Hey.

783
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,078
Come here. Please!

784
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,664
I got a guy in there, <i>mamita.</i>

785
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,296
An actor's an actor. Come on,
act like you're enjoying yourselves.

786
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,927
Look, honestly...

787
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,764
...I can't do anything today
that I won't be proud of tomorrow.

788
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,434
-Did you hear that shit?
-Yes, girl.

789
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,893
Do you believe that shit?

790
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,062
I didn't know they still
make girls like this!

791
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,149
You gotta keep her here, Lucky.
Keep her, okay?

792
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,569
Sherman, how's the transmission
on the old Eldorado?

793
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:54,114
It's fine. You deaf prick,
go get the keys to the Eldo- Go!

794
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:57,284
Go get the keys.
And to the country place too.

795
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,619
I got just the spot for you, okay?

796
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,538
It used to belong
to my wife's mother...

797
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,915
...back then
when I still needed a wife.

798
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,960
Look, when you get back,
do me a favour, okay?

799
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:10,297
I want you to consider
letting me be her manager.

800
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,965
I'll take 10 percent. Legit.

801
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,510
And you're never gonna have to worry
about me trying to get into your pants.

802
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,970
Keys!

803
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,390
-Ain't that the truth, Lucky?
-That's the truth.

804
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,271
Antonio?

805
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,829
Roland? You okay?

806
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,335
Baby, you're not even-
You're not even tied up.

807
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,172
Come on. Hey, untie me, okay?

808
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,925
Listen to me.
They tossed my handbag in here...

809
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,384
...when they brought us in.

810
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,970
You remember the pepper spray
that you gave me?

811
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,223
Remember the pepper spray?
I still have it.

812
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,643
-That's my superhero.
-If we're gonna fucking die...

813
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,437
...let's just let it be
on our own terms, okay?

814
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,782
-Hey, hey. Who you calling?
-What, are you my man now?

815
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,659
I gotta pee.

816
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,994
Well, I guess you better
roll the window down...

817
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,956
...and back your ass up to the crack
and piss out the window.

818
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:29,751
I don't see any toilets,
and I ain't stopping.

819
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,008
<i>Roland, you just gotta untie me.</i>

820
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:41,304
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry. I've never been
strong enough for you.</i>

821
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,057
<i>No, you are strong enough.</i>

822
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,101
<i>Please, just untie me.</i>

823
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,728
<i>Okay? You remember
the pepper spray that you gave me?</i>

824
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,565
<i>Remember the pepper spray?</i>
<i>I still have it.</i>

825
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,694
Pepper spray. That's original.

826
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:01,449
Still, you have to give her points
for spunk.

827
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,627
Crazy motherfuckers.

828
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,016
Stop! No!

829
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,438
Stop.

830
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:38,445
I gotta pee. You've gotta stop the car.
I gotta pee really bad.

831
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:42,282
I gotta pee, I'm serious.
Please, stop the car. I gotta pee.

832
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:43,992
All right.

833
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,329
I'm gonna pee all over the car
in a second.

834
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,247
Please, stop the car.
Just stop the car.

835
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,375
-You gonna be real chilly if-
-Stop the car. Stop the car, please.

836
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,085
I gotta pee.

837
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,799
Oh, God.

838
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,478
Don't look.

839
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,700
<i>You've reached Solly Sol, the man.</i>

840
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:29,537
<i>Time is money,
so make it quick, money.</i>

841
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,345
Yeah.

842
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,222
A friend of yours
just came by to visit.

843
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:51,851
-Who might that be?
-Lucky and his new girlfriend.

844
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,145
What a doll.

845
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,361
-No more cell phone.
-What the fuck?

846
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,863
GPS. Could be tracking us.

847
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,700
From now on, we going off grid.
They wanna track us...

848
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,660
...they can track that shit
up to Canada.

849
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,745
Thank you, folks, for coming.

850
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,623
All the ballistics at the strip club
have been accounted for.

851
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,085
-Meaning what?
-It seems Lucky didn't shoot anybody.

852
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,796
Not yet anyway.
What about the Canadian border?

853
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,716
They didn't show.
Neither did the girl.

854
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,220
-It's got mayonnaise in it, man.
-I told those jokers you wanted soy.

855
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,472
Well, check it out next time,
will you? Shit.

856
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,017
-What about Franklin?
-Still tracking his every move.

857
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,228
-Hey, can I have your sandwich?
-Yeah, yeah. Knock yourself out.

858
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,649
I think I better
change your bandage, Kojak.

859
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,901
Bandage is fine.

860
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,573
You was fucking Sol, wasn't you?

861
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,409
-Say what?
-You was boning him, right?

862
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,997
That night, you was supposed
to be the getaway driver, wasn't you?

863
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,083
No. We didn't need a getaway
until you fucked things up.

864
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,212
I didn't fuck things up. The whole
scenario was a setup. Sol was a fink.

865
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,507
Gino was in with the cops, and they
was running the shake-and-take.

866
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,011
Don't worry about
Sol returning your phone calls.

867
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:11,765
-What?
-They popped him. He's dead.

868
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:24,152
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

869
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:29,407
Sometimes in life, it seems like
if you don't have bad luck...

870
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:33,953
-...you don't have no luck at all.
-No.

871
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,500
No, I did not sleep with Sol and no.

872
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:43,129
-Whatever. It don't matter.
-What? No, it matters to me.

873
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,299
I know that you think
because I'm a stripper...

874
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,677
...that I sleep with everybody,
but that's not the case.

875
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,931
-Sol was just an acquaintance.
-Or just a friend, right?

876
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:55,934
Yes. I mean, you know, he gave me
paper every now and then...

877
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,895
...but to tell the truth,
he was more intent on impressing you.

878
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:02,315
He used to say
that you were a true player.

879
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,235
You know, an original gangster.

880
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,115
Original gangster. Player.

881
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,786
Well, the frog's in a well,
and rat's in a cage.

882
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,205
What does that mean?

883
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,083
It means all of these
player gangsters out here...

884
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,418
...they get so caught up
in their own fantasy...

885
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,172
...that they can't see the real picture.
See, they think they running shit.

886
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,883
They ain't running shit.
More likely they running in shit.

887
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,177
They just can't smell it though.

888
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:36,599
Look, I did things. I was grimy.
I hustled, I scrambled, I did all of that.

889
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,602
At one point I thought
the world was mine.

890
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:44,065
And then I realised,
oh, man, I got caught in a trick.

891
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:48,236
Trick had me killing my own people,
killing myself.

892
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:53,074
Probably killed more black people
than the Ku Klux Klan.

893
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:58,037
So you're trying to find
your way out of hell.

894
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,874
I can't find my way out of shit.

895
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,711
And anybody who follows me
is foolish.

896
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,465
Including you.

897
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:21,186
Oh, this is for you, Lucky!

898
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:40,079
<i>And now authorities are offering
a $200,000 reward for the capture...</i>

899
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,165
<i>-...of the Sawtooth Killers.
</i>-Just pick one.

900
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,886
Fuck you. Life's too short to be evil.

901
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,259
Wait up, bitch! Shit.

902
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,971
-How much further?
-How the hell should I know?

903
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:42,183
Probably could have been there if you
hadn't given the damn car a seizure.

904
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,228
What? What?

905
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,231
Put that shit away.

906
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,692
My ankle.

907
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:55,405
-Can you come help me, please?
-I told you about them cute-ass shoes.

908
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,160
Just help me up, please.

909
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,581
-You can't walk at all?
-No.

910
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,380
Damn. Come on.

911
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,841
-Oh, wait.
-Here.

912
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,218
-Here, you hold this.
-Okay.

913
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,178
I'm watching you.

914
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,347
Damn.

915
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,936
Jesus.

916
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,359
Keep going. Come on.

917
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,571
-You hear something?
-Like what?

918
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,740
I thought I heard something.

919
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,243
Maybe it's nothing.

920
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,537
Don't start freaking me out, Lucky.

921
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,998
Seriously, I don't like
that <i>Blair Witch-type </i>shit.

922
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,584
Yeah, but I bet you like biscuits.

923
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,555
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

924
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,227
Here, I see something.

925
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,818
I think....

926
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:22,408
-I think this is it.
-You're kidding, right?

927
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:26,662
Look, you just stay here, all right?
I'm gonna go check things out.

928
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,666
Wait, Lucky. Seriously,
this doesn't feel right.

929
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:52,438
Damn. No light.

930
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,109
Okay. I'll see if I can find a light.

931
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,613
See if that telephone works.

932
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,783
I should've left my ass in Jersey.

933
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:08,788
No, there's no dial tone.
There's no dial tone.

934
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,749
Where are you going?

935
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,751
Lucky.

936
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,629
I'm almost positive
I've seen it here before.

937
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,549
A blue van.

938
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,929
I would've called earlier,
but Fred said, "Don't get involved."

939
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:31,310
He's got irritable bowels.
You know how it is.

940
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:35,064
Yeah, yeah, I know how that is.
Well, Ethel, I wanna thank you.

941
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,608
You know,
you may have saved a life.

942
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,069
And, Fred, I wanna thank you too.

943
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,240
Did you hear that, Fred?
The young man said I was a lifesaver.

944
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:47,743
-Whose wife?
-Oh, come on.

945
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,706
Why is it as women get older,
their hair gets shorter...

946
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:54,208
...and their jewellery gets bigger?

947
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,297
-Yeah.
<i>-Yeah, captain, it's Lee.</i>

948
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,507
<i>-You in the field?
</i>-No, I'm in the office.

949
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,677
You wanted me to notify you when we
had any movement on Franklin.

950
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:07,305
-Yeah, so where is he?
<i>-North, at the old Sawtooth mill.</i>

951
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:11,350
-You're positive.
-Yeah, yeah. You want me to handle it?

952
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,895
No, no. I'll do this myself.

953
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,855
Fellas, you call me
if anything comes up.

954
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,815
-Anything, all right?
-You got it.

955
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,323
All right, tough guy.

956
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:29,911
Pull up some paper there.
I'll go out and get the firewood.

957
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,292
Leave the lamp.

958
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,680
Oh, and the briefcase too.

959
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,230
Humour me?

960
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,778
I always wanted
to go sledding as a kid.

961
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,448
Rosebud.

962
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:56,122
-Like in <i>Citizen Kane?
</i>-Who?

963
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,791
Forget it.

964
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,421
Okay.

965
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:08,134
-Put the paper in first.
-No, you put the wood in first.

966
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:12,430
-No, no. You put the paper in first.
-No, the wood.

967
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,435
Dumb black guy don't know shit.

968
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,478
-What?
-Exactly.

969
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:23,232
So don't go acting all high and mighty
just because you saw a couple of films.

970
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,110
I'm bilingual.
You're just <i>uno </i>Ebonical.

971
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:44,337
Okay. See, keep it up, I'm not gonna
let you sleep with me tonight.

972
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,508
That's fucked up. You're trying
to scare your way into some pussy.

973
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,636
On the contrary, baby.
I don't want none.

974
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:54,722
-Oh, really?
-Oh, really. Yeah.

975
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:57,558
Because you way too much drama-

976
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,582
Lucky?

977
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:24,293
Yeah, I'm looking for something
for us to eat.

978
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,880
Will you let me whup you
in some checkers later?

979
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,730
It's- Get down.

980
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,281
Bitch.

981
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,457
Bitch!

982
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:59,221
Okay.
You're gonna be all right, baby.

983
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,974
-I gotta get you some help.
-No, don't leave me.

984
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,684
Look, here.

985
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,397
You keep this with you.

986
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:09,982
Yeah.

987
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,650
Now, I saw a farmhouse nearby.

988
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,694
I'm gonna go there
and use their phone...

989
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:16,947
...call for an ambulance. Okay?

990
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,951
Lucky?

991
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,163
Yeah, I got you, baby. I got you.

992
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,666
Leave the briefcase?

993
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,713
I wanna know you're coming back.

994
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,676
Of course I'm coming back.
Of course.

995
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,765
But I mean,
what if somebody else shows up?

996
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,851
Then you're passed out
and then the money....

997
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,605
Come on. Well, I think I'll....

998
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,193
-I'll hide it somewhere.
-Please?

999
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,447
Okay. Okay.

1000
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,826
I'll be back.

1001
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,671
You just said, "The ass of a rat."

1002
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,259
You teach me later.

1003
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,888
Don't go nowhere.

1004
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,695
Babe, I'll tell you what.

1005
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,908
You can fuck her first.

1006
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,118
Really?

1007
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,953
Flip for it?

1008
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:30,915
No.

1009
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,292
I'm in a watching kind of mood.

1010
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,003
Then you can have the first cut.

1011
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,506
Deal.

1012
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:07,284
Just imagine the worst possible things
you can imagine.

1013
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:11,789
When we're done, you're gonna know
how poor your imagination really is.

1014
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,099
Shit. Hey, babe? Babe?

1015
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,476
-What?
-We gotta deal with this.

1016
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,355
Eugene's blasting the TV. This joker's
gonna know someone's home.

1017
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,190
Don't people know any better...

1018
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:40,859
...than to just drop in like that?

1019
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,282
Please. I'm so sorry to bother you.

1020
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,869
We just had an accident in my place
across the way and the phone's out.

1021
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,247
Could you call
an ambulance for us?

1022
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,835
I thought that belonged
to that mobster. Mendez?

1023
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,879
Really?

1024
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,716
Well, he just let us borrow it
for a while.

1025
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,426
I really need your help.

1026
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,679
Come on in.

1027
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,306
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1028
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,224
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1029
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,184
Have a seat.

1030
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,062
-Would you like a cookie or some tea?
-No, thank you.

1031
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,356
-I'm kind of in a hurry.
-Of course.

1032
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,191
I'll get the phone right away.

1033
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,154
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you out of your fricking mind?

1034
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,531
Go with me on this one, Walter.

1035
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:34,079
Lee, I passed the Sawtooth mill
twice, man. What the fuck?

1036
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,539
<i>/-- / don't know, captain.</i>

1037
01:20:35,706 --> 01:20:37,249
<i>Franklin's truck's gotta be there.</i>

1038
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,001
<i>GPS says you're
right on top of him.</i>

1039
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,466
Thank you.

1040
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:48,135
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

1041
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:50,220
I really appreciate this.

1042
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,895
This is not working.

1043
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:00,356
That would be
because I disconnected it.

1044
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,448
Now, this I do not understand.

1045
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,296
Police. Put your gun down.

1046
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:25,464
Put the shit down!

1047
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,640
Where's Lucky?

1048
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,767
Probably in Mexico by now.

1049
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,896
<i>First...</i>

1050
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,731
<i>...there was a note.</i>

1051
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,152
<i>Then there is no note.</i>

1052
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,489
What the fuck is going on?

1053
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:52,658
<i>They killed Roland.</i>

1054
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:57,287
-They can hear everything you say.
<i>-All in your mind.</i>

1055
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,331
<i>Good.</i>

1056
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,292
<i>Because I have had
a bad fucking day.</i>

1057
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:06,296
<i>And all these motherfuckers
are gonna do is keep pissing me off.</i>

1058
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,924
<i>-Illusion.</i>
-There's never a need for name-calling.

1059
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:11,426
What is meant to be is meant to be.

1060
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,512
<i>We're all the children...</i>

1061
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,347
<i>...of the universe.</i>

1062
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,685
<i>Breathe deeply.</i>

1063
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,441
They set us up to escape
and they just came right in...

1064
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,610
...and they slit his throat.
He's a fighter.

1065
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,697
We were supposed to go to New York.
And they just killed him.

1066
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,451
<i>Hey, hey. Look. You're gonna have to
keep it together now, all right?</i>

1067
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,203
<i>Just keep it together.
Hold it together.</i>

1068
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,735
Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

1069
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,403
That's right.
Turn up, look at me.

1070
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:13,822
How you doing, black?
What's up, man?

1071
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,240
What's going on?

1072
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,201
Oh, you looking-
What? What?

1073
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,328
What? Don't you know
what time it is, bro?

1074
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:23,081
I don't think you know what time it is!
Don't you know what time it is?

1075
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,083
It's showtime, motherfuckers!

1076
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,336
Your loss.

1077
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,682
What the fuck is this?

1078
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,272
Hey, hey, hey.
Are we in Mexico?

1079
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,793
Man, if you want an audition...

1080
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,672
...I can get you audition
in WWF or something, man.

1081
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,007
You need to let me go, man.

1082
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,477
Two points!

1083
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,995
You're not turning your punches.

1084
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:47,749
Stop tape!

1085
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,631
What are you talking about?

1086
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:00,304
You're not pronating your punches.

1087
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,599
Listen, man.

1088
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,934
I've studied martial arts
for 17 years.

1089
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,812
So don't you fucking
criticise my technique, okay?

1090
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,858
Always with a guy tied to a chair?

1091
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,111
Oh, yeah. So I suppose
you want me to let you go, right?

1092
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,030
If you were a man, you'd untie him.

1093
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,948
Oh, shit!

1094
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,701
Bill is back in the game!
Check that out, Cass.

1095
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,494
That's so cute.

1096
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,248
Where are we going?

1097
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:30,125
I'm getting you to a hospital.

1098
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:33,295
That fucker said
he was going to get help.

1099
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,047
He left me.

1100
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,633
No, haven't I tried?
Have we done that before?

1101
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,343
You know, it's cool because....

1102
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:45,807
If I can get him to knock this chair over
one more time...

1103
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:49,186
...I can be free
out of this motherfucker.

1104
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,982
-No. No, they will not.
-Oh, yes, they will.

1105
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,539
I was saying....

1106
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,834
Hey, look. Before you introduce me
to Mr. Pinkie there...

1107
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,670
...I don't suppose
I could interest you in a...

1108
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:19,549
...suitcase full of money, could I?

1109
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,968
Well, I guess not.

1110
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,471
You wouldn't be interested
in the money...

1111
01:26:24,638 --> 01:26:26,890
...seeing how you and your friend
get your kicks.

1112
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:31,228
Coupled with the fact that a suitcase
full of money and a black man....

1113
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:34,398
Yeah, it's highly likely that there'd be
a strong police presence.

1114
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:38,610
-In the not-too-distant future.
-Ignore him, babe.

1115
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:40,237
Yeah, yeah.

1116
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,448
Why don't you let Bruce Lee Light
call all the shots?

1117
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,078
Do not provoke me.

1118
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:50,664
Look...

1119
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,625
...I got a shitload of money
in a suitcase.

1120
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,377
I stashed it in a pickup truck.

1121
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:56,712
Cut, cut, cut!

1122
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,131
What is the first fucking rule?

1123
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,216
Do not let these tricks
get to you, babe!

1124
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:02,717
Don't talk to me like that.

1125
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,303
And they've got all those dead cars
out there anyway.

1126
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,098
Yeah, yeah, Bruce.
What do you gotta lose?

1127
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:09,808
Go check.

1128
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:16,773
I'll tell you this, bro.

1129
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,359
You got a lot to lose, man.

1130
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,290
What are you gonna do?
Torture me?

1131
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:35,917
Oh, there's torture.

1132
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:40,338
And then there's torture.

1133
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,178
You think this is my week
away from the family?

1134
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:50,849
I know you but you don't know me.

1135
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,685
How many times
have we passed in the mall?

1136
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,854
You listen
to that gangster-rap shit...

1137
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:57,606
...thinking you're hard.

1138
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,444
And you,
with that little, punky hair...

1139
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,279
...always with the cruel remarks.

1140
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:09,201
"Look at the bitch
with the retarded child." All of you.

1141
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,996
Hurting Eugene
all the time he was a baby.

1142
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,668
But I make you pay.

1143
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,046
Don't I?

1144
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:24,925
Do you ever fucking learn?

1145
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:29,054
You think you know pain?

1146
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:33,975
Abu Ghraib ain't got nothing on us.

1147
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:36,811
I'll show you pain.

1148
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,483
She's so intense.

1149
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:44,361
Hey. What about the money?

1150
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,951
-Yeah, what about the money?
-The money?

1151
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,536
Yeah. Remember?

1152
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,164
The truck.
Five minutes away, outside?

1153
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,416
What the hell
do you expect to get in return?

1154
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,335
Well, sh- Look.

1155
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:04,047
Hey, you let me go
and I'll get you more of it.

1156
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,176
How about I take the money,
kill you...

1157
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,929
...and don't worry about
if there's any more?

1158
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,558
Underneath the hood.

1159
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,275
So, what is it with you and Lucky?

1160
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:27,279
We got a little history together.

1161
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,781
I got time.

1162
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,618
Your boy, Lucky,
ruined a lot of lives.

1163
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:38,081
A lot of lives.

1164
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,584
Justice was never done.

1165
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,795
This time it will be.

1166
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:54,931
-Combination?
-It's not locked.

1167
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,894
Oh, wait- Wait a minute, babe.

1168
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,689
Let's get this shit on tape.

1169
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,245
Okay.

1170
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:28,173
-Are you ready yet?
-I'm all set, babe.

1171
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:37,849
Holy shit, Walter. I think it's real.

1172
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,772
No, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1173
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:55,492
Get me out, please!

1174
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:43,331
-You expect me to beg?
-No.

1175
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:45,250
I expect you to scream.

1176
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,515
-Yeah.
<i>-Lucky just called TIPS.</i>

1177
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:03,560
-What?
<i>-Yeah. He wants to speak with you.</i>

1178
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:06,521
Run a trace.
I'll try to keep him talking.

1179
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,399
-Put him through.
<i>-Hey, Davis.</i>

1180
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,609
I got something you want.

1181
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,945
No more fucking deals this time.

1182
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:15,822
The Sawtooth Killers.

1183
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,032
You know the Sawtooth Killers?

1184
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,619
Yeah. I thought that might
shut you up.

1185
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,621
Well, I got the motherfuckers.

1186
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,957
-Why should I trust you?
<i>-Why should I trust you?</i>

1187
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:28,460
Come here, you'll see for yourself.

1188
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,128
Bring an ambulance, all right?

1189
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,464
-Yeah, where are you?
<i>-Oh, man, come on.</i>

1190
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,591
Come on, man.
Sh- like you don't know.

1191
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,386
-Lee, got that?
<i>-You won't believe it.</i>

1192
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,221
<i>-He's back where you came from.
</i>-What?

1193
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,891
<i>The old farmhouse,
five minutes away, north of the mill.</i>

1194
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:44,309
<i>-Can you get there?
</i>-Yeah.

1195
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,896
<i>-All right. I'll get the guys in motion.
</i>-I'm on it.

1196
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,172
About time.

1197
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:17,383
Look. The Sawtooth Killers?

1198
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:19,469
You wanna see?

1199
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:20,970
Right over there.

1200
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,185
Yeah. Right there.

1201
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,190
That crazy bitch. And the Mexican.

1202
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:37,320
They murdered my boyfriend.

1203
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:40,865
-They were gonna kill us next.
-Who are you?

1204
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:43,535
Rainn Bentley.

1205
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:46,037
This man saved my life.

1206
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,706
Look, they even filmed their shit.

1207
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,459
All the crazy shit they do,
they got it on tape.

1208
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:54,379
They got it caught on tape.
Right in there.

1209
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:57,549
-I gotta go.
-Hey.

1210
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,134
Hold up.

1211
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,052
Think this makes things even?

1212
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,721
Look, hey, man. Look,
I got a woman I gotta go to.

1213
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:04,889
Who's that, Angela?

1214
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,394
She's outside.

1215
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,071
Mama!

1216
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:37,088
Crazy motherfucker!

1217
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:58,902
All right.

1218
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,697
I'll have the charges
against you dropped.

1219
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,368
I'll get you an ambulance.

1220
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:10,955
Go on.

1221
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:16,252
Solid.

1222
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,761
Hey.

1223
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,514
Hey, it's over. Come on.

1224
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,516
Come on up. It's over.

1225
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:33,519
It's over, all right?

1226
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,521
Okay, come on.

1227
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:38,399
Okay.

1228
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:55,792
I trusted you
and you didn't come back.

1229
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:57,418
-Baby, I was-
-Where's the money?

1230
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:00,797
-The money? I was- It was-
-Oh, you're purple! Hell, no!

1231
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:16,521
<i>Well, when I look back on it...</i>

1232
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:20,275
<i>...that was the luckiest day
in an unlucky man's life.</i>

1233
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,111
<i>-Tell them about the money, baby.
-Oh, yeah.</i>

1234
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:28,241
<i>And as luck would have it,
me and Angela...</i>

1235
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:32,704
<i>...collected that
$200,000 reward money too.</i>

1236
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,581
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

1237
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,875
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
