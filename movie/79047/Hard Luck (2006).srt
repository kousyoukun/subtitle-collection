1
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,135
<i>Some people say luck...</i>

2
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,668
<i>ain't nothing but karma
in work clothes.</i>

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,265
<i>Cause and effect.</i>

4
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,067
You'll get us killed, motherfucker.

5
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,642
You get the fuck out of my car.

6
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,472
This is my car. Hell, no!

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,942
What are you, on crack?

8
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,316
Stop the fucking car!

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,651
Look, now get out and let me drive!

10
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,823
Get out!

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,193
Oh, yeah. You have
to go to a hospital.

12
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,460
<i>Yeah, you're wondering, how
the fuck did I get here?</i>

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,665
<i>I made some bad choices.</i>

14
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,078
<i>If it hadn't been for prison,
I never would've met Philomene.</i>

15
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,840
Knowledge is power.

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,385
<i>I'm Cape Verdean.</i>

17
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,179
<i>Got me expanding my horizons.</i>

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,585
<i>Classic falling-for-your-
caseworker, you know.</i>

19
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,820
<i>Philomene wasn't having it or me.</i>

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,468
<i>All I could do was
read and watch movies.</i>

21
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,105
<i>Anything but gangster flicks.</i>

22
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,274
<i>This shit reminded me
too much of my past.</i>

23
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,240
<i>And I was determined to
make sure my past...</i>

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,675
<i>would not be my future.</i>

25
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,923
<i>You know, I worked odd jobs...</i>

26
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:11,085
<i>and Philomene finally
took me seriously.</i>

27
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,226
<i>And we put what we had together,
bought a nice little place down south.</i>

28
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,566
<i>And as luck would have it,
she couldn't have kids.</i>

29
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,370
<i>So we got a dog.</i>

30
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,374
<i>She wanted to name
him Lucky, after me.</i>

31
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:30,345
<i>I said, hell, no.
Give the mutt a chance.</i>

32
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,986
<i>We called him Scraps.</i>

33
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,419
<i>For a moment, I thought my
luck might have changed.</i>

34
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,959
<i>Now, ain't that a bitch?</i>

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,597
<i>All the bullets I done caught over
the years and I get diverticulitis.</i>

36
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,096
<i>They said they had to
operate right away.</i>

37
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:51,159
<i>Maybe luck is a matter of timing.</i>

38
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,606
<i>When I woke up...</i>

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,133
<i>seemed like time had
run out on all of us.</i>

40
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,312
Anybody down here?

41
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,379
Shit. What the fuck is going on?

42
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,522
<i>At first, I thought the rapture
had come and... and...</i>

43
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,525
<i>Like those end-of-the-days preachers
are always talking about.</i>

44
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,258
<i>And J.C., he had come down and
taken everybody except me.</i>

45
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,761
Hello?

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,969
- Hey, come here, boy.
- <i>I repeat:</i>

47
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,334
- Come here.
- <i>This has been a class-five hurricane.</i>

48
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,102
- Yeah, Pops.
- <i>Hurricane Katrina, class-five.</i>

49
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,939
<i>Authorities are now
urging everyone...</i>

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,547
<i>to make their way immediately
to the Superdome.</i>

51
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,344
Don't you trust them. Don't go.

52
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,920
Don't go.

53
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,282
<i>We are told that the National
Guard is on its way.</i>

54
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,426
<i>But we have conflicting reports
as to when that will be.</i>

55
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,790
<i>Maybe Mother Nature...</i>

56
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,936
<i>was trying to give us
one last wake-up call.</i>

57
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,504
<i>Or...</i>

58
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,769
<i>maybe it's like my grandpa said:</i>

59
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,744
<i>"If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all."</i>

60
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,382
<i>Say, hi, Daddy.</i>

61
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,748
<i>No Philomene, no Scraps...</i>

62
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,749
<i>no house.</i>

63
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,446
Freeze.

64
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,819
Roger. Another looter.

65
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,722
Ninth ward, Sector 8.

66
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,557
<i>Situation, Main and
Parrish, request backup.</i>

67
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,665
I'm on it.

68
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,606
<i>Two years ago, Hurricane
Katrina underscored...</i>

69
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,373
<i>the deep economic and class divide
that still exists in this country.</i>

70
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,779
<i>I figured I could be another brother
waving for help from a rooftop...</i>

71
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,555
<i>or take my ass back to New York.</i>

72
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,418
<i>It ain't easy being
king of the city.</i>

73
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,154
I've got that book.
Holiday cheer, right here.

74
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,626
I got what you need.

75
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,026
Look, a black reindeer.

76
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,635
I got that for you. I've got watches.
I've got your Kwanzaa needs.

77
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,237
I've got your Hanukkah needs.
I've got what you need.

78
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,271
I've got the ties.
I've got the coats.

79
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,375
I've got some panties.
Anybody need panties?

80
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,942
- I've got panties.
- Ain't that what's-his-name?

81
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,545
Used to run 135th Street?

82
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,375
Hell, no, that ain't him right
there, man, you bugging.

83
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,380
- That's him, son.
- He died a while back.

84
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,847
He got popped for no telling.

85
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,350
- We out of here, man.
- You too.

86
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,785
Look at them, I got the
glasses for you now, baby.

87
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,722
You know what I'm saying?
You can see how it goes down.

88
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,286
All right, beautiful, right?
I've got them.

89
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,863
Two for 5. Two for 5.

90
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,687
- <i>How's this?</i>
- Better.

91
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,862
Oh, whoa, okay, hey, hey. Cass?

92
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,295
Would you watch it with the 1 K,
because you're flaring me out here?

93
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,301
<i>Could you be a little louder?
I wanna go deaf, like Pete Townshend.</i>

94
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,372
I told you not to point it
directly at the camera.

95
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,544
<i>Pardon me if I'm not up to the
standards of your professionalism.</i>

96
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,043
Okay. Just pan the 650
15 degrees to the left.

97
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,442
<i>My left or camera left?</i>

98
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,516
No, it's always left cam...
Camera left, Cass.

99
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,950
It's not really that hard to remember.
Stage right, camera left.

100
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,124
<i>Okay.</i>

101
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:37,126
<i>So this is one of those days
when I can't do anything right.</i>

102
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,855
<i>Love is when you...</i>

103
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,557
<i>and all the fucked-up shit
you ever did in your life...</i>

104
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,301
<i>and the fucked-up shit that you're
probably gonna do in your life...</i>

105
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,101
<i>and every little thing that
you could possibly think...</i>

106
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,676
<i>that would embarrass the living shit
out of you on any day of the week...</i>

107
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,178
<i>to any other person on the
face of the universe...</i>

108
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,476
<i>but to this one special woman.</i>

109
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,086
<i>She takes it all.</i>

110
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,848
<i>And she kisses the
feet you walk on...</i>

111
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,924
<i>without judgment, without anything.</i>

112
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:13,531
<i>Someone that you know that you
can shit, fuck, piss, crap, cry.</i>

113
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,258
<i>All of that, you know.
That's what love is, now.</i>

114
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,267
<i>You know, or kind of like going on
an odyssey. Know what I mean?</i>

115
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,770
<i>It's like a fantasy voyage
or something, you know?</i>

116
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,102
<i>And, like, I'm like
James T. Kirk...</i>

117
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,576
<i>and she's like Princess Leia
or something, I don't know.</i>

118
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:34,083
<i>And, like, we're going where no
couple has ever gone before.</i>

119
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,115
Hey, Lucky. Hey, man, what's up?

120
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,315
Yo, open the door. I'm coming in.

121
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,068
- What's up, baby?
- What's up?

122
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,499
- Fo' shizzle, my nizzle.
- What's up, dog?

123
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,037
Yo, man, when you gonna
teach your man to talk?

124
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,906
- All right, man.
- Yeah, he's all right.

125
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,048
You only saying that because
you're on his payroll.

126
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,779
What you got there?

127
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:11,082
Well, can't have my employee of the month
rolling up to my birthday party...

128
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,884
wearing some
Swahili-Afro-boogie bullshit.

129
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,323
Shit. I'm not your employee.

130
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,497
My bad. My top associate.

131
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,858
Got to represent, you know?

132
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,829
Better not be that
fantasy pimp shit...

133
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,798
- ...that you like wearing.
- No, baby. Tasteful.

134
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,268
I got Sean John, a.k.a. P. Dizzle.

135
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,668
- It's nice.
- Well, can a brother get a thank-you?

136
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,276
"Well, yeah. Well, thank
you, my Hebrew homes."

137
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,106
Afro Hip Hop Youth Day?

138
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,976
What the fuck you
do with my printer?

139
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,949
Yo, well, just consider it like
your donation to the community.

140
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,990
Hey. Hey, the ink
is expensive, man.

141
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,750
Yo, let's get to business.

142
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,329
All right. All right.

143
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,395
I got the latest
diamond-encrusted Rolex.

144
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,829
I got the new, gold,
baller necklace.

145
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,503
Don't wear that too long.
Your neck will turn green.

146
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,604
I got some sunglasses, some Rays.

147
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,740
- I got everything in here, man.
- Sol.

148
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,502
- What's up?
- Why you do this shit, man?

149
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,078
- What do you mean?
- What I mean, your family got paper.

150
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,648
Your uncle owns the jewelry store.

151
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,946
You're robbing your uncle.

152
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,419
Why you do this?
What do you do this for?

153
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,560
Why did you do it?

154
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,664
I mean, you were one of the
biggest hustlers in Harlem, man.

155
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,198
Mr. Untouchable?

156
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,132
Hey, you was poisoning
your own people.

157
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,330
- Yo.
- Yo. No offense, bro.

158
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:39,136
I mean, it's the American way, right?
We all want more.

159
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,313
Even Donald fucking
Trump wants more.

160
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,415
More... More power,
more money, more bling.

161
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,982
More punani.

162
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,621
Yo, listen, it's real important to me
that you be on time tonight, you know?

163
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,086
- I'll send the fellas.
- I want to talk about that.

164
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,158
- What's up?
- I'm not gonna be able to roll, man.

165
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,592
- What are you talking about, man?
- You know, that's your thing, man.

166
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,824
- I ain't...
- Oh, but it's my birthday party, man.

167
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,331
We'll have a crazy time, son.

168
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,266
Look, I got all this shit for you.
You're gonna love it, man.

169
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,905
That's you, right there.

170
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,598
- I get to wear this?
- Yes, you get to wear this.

171
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,269
I don't know, man. I don't know.

172
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,549
No, man. That's your world.

173
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,277
This is my size.

174
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,545
- He likes it, he likes it.
- Yeah, baby.

175
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,851
She starts screwing around and has
no idea whose kid she's having.

176
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,356
Well, that's how she sees it.

177
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,994
- Don't get knocked up.
- Excuse me.

178
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,097
- Can you help me?
- Just saying, it's not fair to the kids.

179
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,993
Got it.

180
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,196
I'm going back in for
the picnic table.

181
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,735
Hey, babe. Smile for the camera.

182
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,207
- You know how we do.
- Oh, yeah.

183
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,609
So you tell them about what we're
gonna do later on. All right?

184
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,243
I think they ready, sir.

185
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,252
Oh, yeah. They ready.
You see that today?

186
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,155
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

187
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,828
Hey, look, Mr. C., about
those flyers and everything?

188
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,156
Ain't gotta worry about that.
I got that for free.

189
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,128
My man hooked me up
and everything...

190
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,062
Beautiful.

191
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,903
You'd think by now that
people would understand...

192
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,802
that you reap what you sow.

193
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,336
Would you rather have your kids
in a dance group or a gang?

194
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,779
Dance group. Without question.

195
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,442
It seems the government's more
interested in building prisons...

196
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,316
than investing in the kids.

197
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,949
This is gonna be our last show.

198
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,994
They've taken away our funding,
so we've gotta close the place down.

199
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,866
Yeah, I know.

200
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,565
But don't you let this unravel
all the good work you've done.

201
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,413
For this place, for these kids.

202
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,809
Most of all, for yourself.

203
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,408
You've turned your life around.

204
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,681
You stayed on the path.

205
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,015
I was really looking
forward to this, you know?

206
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,494
Really looking forward to it.

207
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,260
All right, Mr. C.

208
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,771
Good luck to you, young brother.

209
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,635
Hey, you know how we do.

210
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,403
We're in the trenches,
baby. In the trenches.

211
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,689
The bitches in this piece.

212
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,953
Sir, you're here with
the Rosenbaum's party.

213
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,459
Right this way, sir.

214
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,928
<i>Putting it down. New Booty
Room, to your right.</i>

215
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,260
<i>We got the Oom-Boom Room.</i>

216
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,465
<i>We've got lap dances for $25.</i>

217
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,038
<i>30, if you're a good tipper.</i>

218
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,606
<i>And on the stage right now...</i>

219
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,505
<i>we got Carmen, all
the way from Cuba.</i>

220
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,270
<i>You gotta love Castro.</i>

221
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,745
<i>She swam over here for
you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

222
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,975
<i>You know what? We gotta
pay for that education.</i>

223
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,245
<i>Go in your pockets.
No food stamps. No coin.</i>

224
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,945
<i>Just stuff that folds.</i>

225
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,920
<i>Carmen putting it down for you.</i>

226
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,459
<i>Right here in The Cadillac Lounge.
This is DJ Big Cat.</i>

227
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,735
Yeah, go on, girl.
Get triple-X with it.

228
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,136
Money to share.

229
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,972
Oh, shit. Yeah. What's up, dog?

230
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,145
Come on, you gotta admit it.
I'm as pretty as new money, right?

231
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,942
You look like Tony
Montana on crack.

232
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,847
Yeah. Well, you would know.

233
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,316
- What's up?
- Happy birthday.

234
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,581
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

235
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,055
- I dressed you well. Look at you.
- Yeah, yeah.

236
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,091
Very nice. Very nice. Let's drink.

237
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,058
Oh, shit. You know what time it is?

238
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,529
It's time for some more
Cristal in this bitch.

239
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,870
Happy birthday toast
to the birthday boy.

240
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,256
So, basically, what's your flavor?

241
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:03,334
You know, you like vanilla,
chocolate, mocha? Some swirl?

242
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,765
No plastic.

243
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,461
- No plastic.
- Oh, okay.

244
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,107
All right. Brothers like some
genuine junk in the trunk.

245
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,174
I know, I know.

246
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,007
Yo.

247
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,909
Carmen.

248
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,107
Don't you pretend you
don't know me. It's me.

249
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,310
You know, excuse me,
Benjamin Franklin?

250
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,957
You know, come on. See,
my associate over here...

251
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,523
he ain't never been to Cuba.

252
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,628
Why don't you take him
all the way to C-U-B-A?

253
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,398
Everybody hold their positions.

254
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,696
- We move on my command.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

255
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,043
<i>I'm in love with a stripper.</i>

256
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,047
<i>I'm in love with a stripper,
that's why I'm working here.</i>

257
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,049
Oh, yeah.

258
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,122
That's him right there.
In the black suit.

259
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,721
Bonus.

260
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,918
You can hold my stick too.

261
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,850
You wish.

262
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,902
I thought she liked me.

263
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:52,937
I mean, baby got ass like
a Shetland pony. Right.

264
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,479
Lucky.

265
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,184
- I want you to meet the owner.
- Why?

266
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,218
Well, you know, he's just a friend.
You know, like that.

267
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,285
No, come on, yo. It's...

268
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,189
I mean, you know, make me
look good here, you know?

269
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,794
- It's my birthday. Come on.
- Make you look good?

270
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,555
- Yeah.
- Dude...

271
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:19,260
I got... I got a little
deal here, okay?

272
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,064
You know, I figure with
you here, you know...

273
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,969
everything goes right, you know?
Who's gonna mess with me?

274
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,145
Mess with you? Why don't
you take your boys?

275
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,746
Oh, come on, man. Be serious.

276
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,609
Listen, Lucky, okay?

277
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,444
I'm in deep here, you know?

278
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,718
So, come on, just, I'm not
telling nothing, okay?

279
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,859
Please, Lucky. Come on. You know?

280
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,755
Who's getting you back
on your feet? Me.

281
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,429
Who trusted you when no one would?

282
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,724
Me, okay? Now help me.

283
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,766
Okay, you don't gotta say nothing
or you don't gotta do nothing.

284
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,529
Just stand there.
Just be there with me.

285
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,607
Okay? Please.
Just this once, all right?

286
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,237
- What do you say?
- Oh, man.

287
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,773
Look who it is.

288
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,737
Now I believe in reincarnation.

289
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,535
Holy shit, I thought you were dead.

290
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,678
Yeah, well, so did I.

291
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,245
Come here, man.

292
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,918
- Keeping it together?
- I am, I am, I am.

293
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,577
Gentlemen, I believe we have
some business to transact.

294
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,417
Jesus. Fifteen years?

295
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,183
- Lucky, please stay.
- Yo, man.

296
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,917
Don't let me interrupt.
Handle bu...

297
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,390
- Have a seat.
- I'm just...

298
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,030
Please. Join us.

299
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,401
You need something, baby?

300
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,638
As requested.

301
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,409
250 thousand dollars.

302
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,850
Each case.

303
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,785
Hey.

304
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,581
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lucky.
Lucky, Lucky, please stay.

305
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,883
- I'm just gonna take a piss, baby.
- No, no, no.

306
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,153
You're my guest. Please. We're gonna
have a little drink here, please.

307
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,661
Sit, sit, sit. Please.

308
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,134
You gotta teach your pet
Jew boy some manners.

309
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,101
Now, I showed you mine.

310
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,476
Four cases, 100 per crate.

311
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,311
The minivan's parked out back.

312
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,014
Beretta Cheetah.

313
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,850
Magazine capacity...

314
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,685
thirteen, as requested.

315
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,252
- Let's get out of here, man.
- What?

316
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,866
Jenny, how about some champagne?

317
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,035
He's a rat.

318
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,430
Let's get out of here,
man. Come on.

319
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,203
Yo. Sorry, homeboy.
You know how it is.

320
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,142
Gots to get paid.

321
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,049
Everybody hold until
we confirm the goods.

322
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,880
<i>Roger.</i>

323
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,101
- <i>Yeah, the Berettas look good.</i>
- The merchandise checks out.

324
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,576
Bravo. Bravo. Successful
business transaction.

325
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,975
<i>Police! You're under arrest!</i>

326
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,310
The guest of honor
should do the honors.

327
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,815
For old times' sake.

328
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,588
Yeah, that's a good idea.
No problem.

329
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,424
You never cease to amaze me.

330
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,686
Oh, I try not to, baby.

331
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,056
- Big baller.
- It's good to see you, my man.

332
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,528
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,896
- Back in the life.
- No, no, no. Not me.

334
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,800
- No?
- I'm just a hostess.

335
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,002
- There you go.
- Gino, why don't you go ahead?

336
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,271
Wrap up things outside.

337
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,338
Hey, hey!

338
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,949
- What the fuck you doing, man?
- What am I doing?

339
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,784
Oh, shit! Oh, my God! He's got
a fucking wire! Oh, my God!

340
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,744
<i>There comes a point in life when
you just gotta say, "Fuck it."</i>

341
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,675
<i>You gotta play the hand
that life deals you...</i>

342
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,512
<i>and let the chips
fall where they may.</i>

343
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,050
Don't shoot!

344
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,288
Where's my fucking money?

345
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,467
Who is that? Whose fucking
red Mustang is that?

346
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,399
The Latin chick. Carmen.

347
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,095
She goes by the name Carmen.

348
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,708
Telling you now, you piece of shit,
I go down, you're going down with me.

349
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,276
Move out, let's go!

350
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,709
- What the fuck is going on?
- Get on the ground.

351
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,281
- What are you, fucking crazy?
- Get down on the ground.

352
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,155
Hello? Who's there?

353
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,288
Who is it?

354
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,303
Get down. Get down.

355
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,636
Okay.

356
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,607
What are you, on crack?

357
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,215
- He's heading downtown.
- <i>I'm right behind you.</i>

358
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,666
Who is this fucking guy?

359
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,869
You'll get us killed, motherfucker.

360
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,140
Pop this fucker.

361
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,515
This is my car. Hell, no!

362
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,750
Shoot him! Shoot him!

363
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,563
- <i>Headed south on Waterman.</i>
- Cut him off at the tunnel.

364
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,164
<i>I'm three blocks away.</i>

365
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,391
Get your ass there now!

366
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,238
Stop the fucking car!

367
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,881
This fucker's out of his mind.
He went in the tunnel.

368
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,516
Take the Thompson Street
over-ramp and block the exit.

369
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,747
We'll get him from behind.

370
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,187
You need to go to a hospital.

371
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,757
Hold on.

372
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,898
Seal the exit! Seal the exit!

373
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,209
- Get there, now!
- <i>I'm right on top of you.</i>

374
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,652
Motherfucker!

375
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,225
You need to go to a hospital.

376
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:08,305
No hospitals. No hospitals.

377
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,630
Bring me a towel with
some hot water on it.

378
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,508
And don't forget the soap.
Bring the soap.

379
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:02,188
Look, you want me to help you,
you gotta put that thing away.

380
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:08,956
- Okay. Take your clothes off.
- Are you fucking nuts?

381
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,330
It ain't like I ain't already seen
you naked. Take your shit off.

382
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,673
Look, this way I know you're
less likely to bounce.

383
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,406
Take your shit off.

384
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,146
What, what, do you need a beat?

385
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,448
Happy?

386
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,724
Carmen.

387
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,627
That's your dance name, right?
What's your real name?

388
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,925
- Angela.
- Okay.

389
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,697
Angela, who's probably
not from Cuba, listen.

390
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,635
I have no intentions
of hurting you.

391
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,039
Just don't make me get stupid,
all right? Just be cool...

392
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,978
do what I say, everything will
be all right. You feel me?

393
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,747
Yeah, I feel you.

394
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,414
Here. Help me get this off.

395
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,797
It's showtime.

396
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,854
You should be a nurse, girl.

397
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,087
What? And leave my good-paying
job as a stripper?

398
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,893
My mother was a nurse in
Puerto Rico. Minimum wage.

399
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:31,633
- Do I believe this story?
- Why not? It's free.

400
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,707
Translation?

401
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,475
Heal, heal, by the butt of a frog.

402
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,778
If it doesn't heal today,
it'll heal tomorrow.

403
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,319
Try it. It's good luck.

404
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:52,318
Okay, well, now that
you're all bandaged up...

405
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,259
I should let you rest.

406
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,564
Yeah, we both should.
It's a good idea.

407
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,666
Come lay down next to me.

408
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,644
Look. As much shit as
I've done in my life...

409
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,779
I've never housed a
woman for some pussy.

410
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,312
And I don't plan on starting now.

411
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,082
Just lay down.

412
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,152
Other side. Away from the door.

413
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,296
Just humor me.

414
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:47,131
- What you doing?
- You want some?

415
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:53,406
- You got a lot of game, huh?
- I was referring to the lip-gloss.

416
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,810
So how long are you
gonna hold me hostage?

417
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,215
Good question.

418
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,008
Why are you doing this?

419
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,680
<i>Mama.</i>

420
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,874
Stop tape.

421
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,884
<i>Mama.</i>

422
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,248
- It's your turn.
- I did it the last fucking time.

423
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,788
It's your kid, babe.
I'll handle it from here.

424
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,206
- Mama.
- I'm coming, baby.

425
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,747
Mama!

426
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:18,952
Oh, honey. Here.
Let's take the mask off.

427
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,859
That's okay, baby.
We'll put it right back on.

428
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:26,264
Here. Okay. Come on.
All right. Come on.

429
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,705
That's a good boy.
Come on, sweetie.

430
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:41,046
Here. You sit down, right here.

431
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,847
Oh, yeah. It's okay.
We'll take this off just for a minute.

432
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,355
- I wanna be Spiderman.
- Oh, we'll see. We'll see.

433
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,722
I wanna go trick-or-treating.
I want candy, Mama.

434
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,830
Baby, you can't go out there.
Here are your meds.

435
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,297
Here are your meds.
Take that now. Good boy.

436
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:06,266
- Okay, that's good.
- I wanna go trick-or-treating, Mama.

437
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,444
I know, baby. I'm...
Mommy's gonna sing to you.

438
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:12,013
Mommy's gonna sing
to you now. Okay?

439
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:32,931
<i>I finally get my hands on a half a
million dollars and it's wired.</i>

440
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,272
<i>Gotta be bank money or cop money.</i>

441
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,104
<i>No one else would rig
it up like that.</i>

442
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:47,212
<i>If I try to keep it,
we're both in danger.</i>

443
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,418
<i>She doesn't even know.</i>

444
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,452
<i>It doesn't seem fair.</i>

445
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:13,805
<i>Only one way out. That
money was our lifeline.</i>

446
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,775
- What?
- Gino.

447
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,911
It's for you.

448
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,188
- Yeah.
- Hey, look.

449
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,762
No problems, no questions.

450
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,594
Return all the money and then
everything is cool, right?

451
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,533
- Where are you?
- I'll call you back. No!

452
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,540
No.

453
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,790
- Are we dead?
- Yes.

454
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,467
Okay. So we have the most
wonderful thing for you tonight.

455
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,204
Yes.

456
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:26,076
The most beautiful little rat.

457
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,975
I had a pet rat when I
was in junior high.

458
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,649
But sometimes rats get hungry.

459
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,362
- <i>What the fuck?</i>
- Stop the tape.

460
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,437
- I think she's dead, Walter.
- You're shitting me.

461
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:55,169
- I can't find a pulse.
- Fucking Jesus-fucking-Christ.

462
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,113
Okay, get away from... Get a...

463
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,010
Gee, she's probably got
that bird-flu thing.

464
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,018
Yeah, sure.

465
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,025
- Check that out.
- What is it?

466
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,665
Bitch had a fucking heart
condition, is what it is.

467
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,831
I suppose that's my fault.

468
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,870
None of my picks ever
dropped dead on us.

469
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,510
So all of a sudden you're
the health expert.

470
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:31,603
You can tell if someone walking down
the street has a heart condition.

471
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,340
Look, you gonna help me with this?

472
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,489
You were sleeping.
What are you doing?

473
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,394
- What the fuck is all this purple shit?
- The security dye in with the money.

474
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,502
- How would I know that was in there?
- Why are you rummaging...

475
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,502
- ...through people's shit?
- People? Nigga, what people?

476
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,574
I don't see people. You held
me hostage at gunpoint...

477
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:03,042
- ...and nearly tried to rape me.
- Rape you? I don't even want you.

478
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,917
Okay. What about, "Oh, take off all
your clothes and lie down with me"?

479
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:11,584
Would you... Look at this shit,
would you? Look at this shit. Look.

480
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,347
You need to buy me a new fur.

481
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,390
If you don't get that fake
shit out of my face...

482
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:26,802
Man. That money was
our bargaining chip.

483
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:31,464
Bargaining chip? Look, whatever.
All I know, there's another briefcase.

484
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,810
If that briefcase is full of money,
just break me off my share...

485
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:38,448
for of all of my troubles, and
I'll be on my merry freaking way.

486
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,674
What is wrong with you?
It's an identical case.

487
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,716
There's a security
device in that one too.

488
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,912
You need a special
tool to de-rig it.

489
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,918
Fuck.

490
00:38:55,466 --> 00:39:01,061
You know what? That's a good idea.
You wanna bounce, just leave. Take...

491
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,263
So wait. You get to keep
it all for yourself.

492
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,908
What story am I
supposed to believe?

493
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,150
I'm sorry.

494
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,704
Mommy, he's purple
like Lord Krishna.

495
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,078
The old-man mask is $7.99.

496
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,483
And I'm gonna need
to price-check that.

497
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,715
- Can't I just wear it?
- Sure.

498
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,052
After you take it
off and pay for it.

499
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:10,863
Matt? I'm gonna need a price
check on the old-lady mask.

500
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,100
Price check on three.

501
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:23,045
Still waiting on a price check
on three on an old-lady mask.

502
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,681
It's a dye. It's not gonna come
off the money. That's the point.

503
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:33,023
Oh, hell no. I'm gonna clean this
bitch off and I'm gonna spend it.

504
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,827
Shit. Why does this shit
always happen to me?

505
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,231
And I just got my hair done.

506
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,804
- Turn around.
- Why?

507
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,670
So I can do your back, okay?

508
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,711
Be gentle, please.

509
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,915
Here, <i>café con leche.</i>

510
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,953
Prick.

511
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:25,347
- Who's gonna pay for all this?
- Money was rigged.

512
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:30,980
Come over here. Look at this tub.
Who's gonna clean that?

513
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:38,252
Yeah. For what?

514
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,788
Yeah, tell him I'm on my way.

515
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:47,570
- Captain wants to see me.
- I'm talking to you. Come over here.

516
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,261
Look at the tub.

517
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:55,876
These little Mad Cow
burgers are the bomb.

518
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,310
Excuse me.

519
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,582
Did you blow one? Oh, shit.

520
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,853
You're the one who paid $60
to stick your face in my ass.

521
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,793
I should have gave you incense
and stuck that up your ass.

522
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,230
- Protected the crime scene.
- Like you never fart.

523
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,959
Shit, I don't fart like that.

524
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,365
These are good, but Mickey
D's fries are better...

525
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,770
because they fry them in some crazy
beef or silicone or something.

526
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,312
For real. Did you see
that flick on it?

527
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,674
Yeah, <i>Super Size Me.</i>

528
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,979
Listen to that harmony. Listen.

529
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,363
Excuse me. This is my car.
That's my demo. This is my world.

530
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,537
Look, if I'm delaying you from
your pursuit of happiness...

531
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,036
fame, fortune and your
meeting with Puffy, fine.

532
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,835
You and your demo can
bounce, all right?

533
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,740
I mean, I'll de-rig the money
and I'll send you some of it.

534
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,437
Oh, you'll send me some of it.
Please, you're cheap.

535
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,810
- I saw you tip the waitress.
- I'm ch...? I'm broke.

536
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,782
Yes. No, you're cheap. I wouldn't
trust you to send me shit.

537
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:14,981
So you wanna go solo? All right,
cool. Then option A...

538
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,854
de-rig the other briefcase and
break me off some hush money.

539
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,691
Or option B, I don't
know, maybe I could...

540
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,163
run to the nearest
police station and say:

541
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,871
"I just saw this black man and he
was running with a briefcase...

542
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,034
because he robbed a bank
and he went that way."

543
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,311
We've got to find a closer place.

544
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,848
Sure. Why don't we just stick them
under the floorboards like Gacy?

545
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,180
Like if they ever came to the house
there wouldn't be enough evidence.

546
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,187
A tape doesn't prove anything.
How does anyone know what's real?

547
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,450
Have you heard of DNA?

548
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,254
You don't think they'd find
a spot of blood somewhere?

549
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,530
We're bonded for life, pretty boy.

550
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,247
- You hungry?
- The diner?

551
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,649
- Oh, let's go get cleaned up.
- Yeah.

552
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,715
- Franklin's here, sir. He's clean.
- Cool.

553
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,191
You finish up with our friends
at Homeland Security.

554
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,658
Okay.

555
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,738
Hey, Frankie!

556
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,910
What's up, player?

557
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,485
- Did you read the paper today?
- No.

558
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,951
Some crazy shit, man.

559
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,522
They got an article...

560
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,092
about high school kids having
oral sex like it ain't nothing.

561
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,287
Like kissing used to be.
You got a daughter, right?

562
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,363
- Yeah.
- How old's your baby?

563
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,798
- She's 14.
- Mine's 13.

564
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:12,567
Statistically, what the trip is,
it's the white kids from suburbia.

565
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:16,143
They're more into the oral sex.
Blacks, Latinos, Asians are all fucking.

566
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:20,874
But the white kids got them
beat, per capita, on blowjobs.

567
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,250
You think I'm fucking
with you, huh?

568
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:29,089
Check it out. Right
there for yourself.

569
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:35,621
Right under the article
on the dirty cops.

570
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,299
Yeah, another Rodney
King-type shit.

571
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,629
They got some knucklehead cops...

572
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,274
beating up inmates and
taking their jewelry, man.

573
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,466
Now, who wants some pimpy shit
like that anyway? Am I right?

574
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,407
But you know how it is, man.

575
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,644
Dirty cops anywhere kind of...

576
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,551
Kind of makes us all
look bad, don't it?

577
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,725
Captain, I can explain.

578
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,858
I'm not an idealist.

579
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,531
I know we put our lives on the
line daily for inadequate pay.

580
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:19,107
Criminals make more in a month
than we will in a whole damn year.

581
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,506
So the temptation's always
gonna be there to say:

582
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:28,618
"Fuck it. Let me augment my
retirement fund a little bit."

583
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,317
- But you took it to a new level.
- There's a miscommunication.

584
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,548
- That money was used strictly for...
- Motherfucker, please.

585
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,590
You took the money from
the evidence room.

586
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,955
You set up a deal to
buy some contraband.

587
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,028
When the deal goes
down, you bust them.

588
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,962
And you put the money back before
anyone knows the difference.

589
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,693
You sell the contraband
or you keep it.

590
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,066
That shit ain't original.

591
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,435
Only difference was, this
time I rigged the money.

592
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,612
And apparently,
this time, you lost it.

593
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,210
So why am I out here instead
of an IAD review board?

594
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,054
Like I said...

595
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:13,125
dirty cops anywhere make
it hard for all of us.

596
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,621
I'm prepared to offer you an out.

597
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,594
- I'm listening.
- Good. One...

598
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,829
you write up a report
on the busted sting.

599
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,272
You take the hit on the lost
money, I sign off on it.

600
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,446
Two, I want all those Berettas
put in the evidence room.

601
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,740
I don't want that shit on
the street. Three...

602
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,544
you and your cockroach friends
submit your resignations...

603
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,312
which I will accept,
effective immediately.

604
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,491
And you will retire with
your pensions intact.

605
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,387
Lastly, Lee.

606
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,599
Detective Lee goes
with you right now.

607
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,530
You hand over any
surveillance tapes...

608
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,170
audio or visual, that
have Lucky on them.

609
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,863
- Lucky?
- Lucky.

610
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,566
You forget you ever saw his ass.

611
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,604
Lucky's my problem now.

612
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,283
All the tsunamis,
earthquakes, floods.

613
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,316
Man is a virus and God
is finished with us.

614
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,748
Bullshit.

615
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,152
We're the ones raising temperatures
with greenhouse gases, not God.

616
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,520
That's why we got more
category-five hurricanes now.

617
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,787
It's so much bigger
than that, babe.

618
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,466
- I'm a serial killer!
- So are we.

619
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,761
- You go trick-or-treating, now.
- Bye.

620
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,237
All right.

621
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,337
If I could get you
the New York fight back...

622
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:38,340
- ...would you make a deal with me?
- What's the deal?

623
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:44,012
If you win, you win. And
if you lose, you quit.

624
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,591
Go sit down, honey.

625
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,660
Order some vegetarian to go for
Eugene. I'm gonna wash up.

626
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,561
In this world of plagues
and killer bird flus...

627
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,363
you find being hygienically
conscious amusing?

628
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,698
- Hey, you go when you go.
- Look at you.

629
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:08,310
Always with the fingers in the face.
Spreading germs. It's disgusting.

630
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,811
<i>Eugene was always special.
His father couldn't handle it.</i>

631
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,213
<i>Left before his fifth birthday.
What was I supposed to do?</i>

632
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,581
<i>Wait for Mr. Perfect?</i>

633
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:23,325
<i>Wait for someone to rescue me and
my son? Life didn't give rebates.</i>

634
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:28,191
I gotta get some food in me.
I got this low-blood-sugar thing.

635
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:31,563
All that psychosomatic shit.
I don't believe in all of that.

636
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,699
Like Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome and all that.

637
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,771
- Hey. I know a guy who died of that.
- Yeah, right.

638
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,840
Nobody's ever died of
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

639
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,535
He couldn't even get out of
bed to eat. It was really sad.

640
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,449
- Must have been a white guy.
- Yeah, so what?

641
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,949
White people got a lot of
free time on their hands.

642
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,917
Black people, we ain't got
time for all that shit.

643
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,988
Okay, Dr. Phil, so,
what about Latinos?

644
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,061
Mi madre <i>always said there are three
kinds of people in this world:</i>

645
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,230
<i>People who watch things happen...</i>

646
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,763
<i>people who complain about
things that happen...</i>

647
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,595
<i>and people who make things happen.</i>

648
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,328
<i>I got a lot I wanna do in my life.</i>

649
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,803
<i>I think men just slow you down.</i>

650
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,272
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through there, to the right.

651
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,139
Great. Catch up.

652
00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:20,309
You got the salt and pepper?
Ketchup?

653
00:50:22,283 --> 00:50:24,510
Look at this guy. Look at this guy.

654
00:50:29,457 --> 00:50:31,081
Hey, hey!

655
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:33,492
Stay right there.

656
00:50:34,061 --> 00:50:35,890
Good afternoon.

657
00:50:37,231 --> 00:50:40,164
- You trying to run out on the check?
- No, no, no.

658
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:42,859
Waitressing is tough enough
without having to pick up...

659
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,334
- Hold him right there, officer.
- What are you doing?

660
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:48,030
This man has been trying to
run out since I got pregnant.

661
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,403
And I know it's his, no
matter what he says.

662
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:54,047
I haven't even been with another man
since last my period. Not even one.

663
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:56,682
I saw him exiting the back door
of the restaurant, okay?

664
00:50:56,784 --> 00:50:58,647
I thought he was running
out on his bill.

665
00:50:58,753 --> 00:51:00,286
- Me?
- We haven't even ordered yet.

666
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:02,649
And you know I'm starving.
I'm eating for two.

667
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:06,293
- You enjoy your lunch.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

668
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:09,192
Hey, we gotta roll.

669
00:51:10,031 --> 00:51:11,758
You want me to quit
fighting for good.

670
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:21,536
- For us.
- No, I can't promise that.

671
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:28,040
- Where you going?
- Why don't you just pay up?

672
00:51:28,216 --> 00:51:30,443
I'm gonna go outside...

673
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:33,552
and I'm gonna make a
couple phone calls...

674
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:36,484
and I'm gonna see
what I can scam up.

675
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:43,923
That was truly fucked up. You
were just gonna leave me here?

676
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:47,794
- Look, you were better off without me.
- I just saved your ass.

677
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:51,170
Look, from now on... From now on...

678
00:51:51,272 --> 00:51:54,830
you gotta do exactly what
I tell you to do. Okay?

679
00:51:54,942 --> 00:51:58,102
No more clowning around.

680
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:00,471
Feel me?

681
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,182
I'm gonna call a friend
of mine. He owes me.

682
00:52:07,288 --> 00:52:09,515
See if he'll let us stay
at one of his cribs...

683
00:52:09,624 --> 00:52:11,919
lay low for a little while.

684
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:14,157
Damn. We gotta get
rid of this car too.

685
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:16,592
- <i>capture of the so-called
Sawtooth Killers.</i>

686
00:52:16,697 --> 00:52:18,230
<i>Captain Davis had this to say.</i>

687
00:52:18,332 --> 00:52:20,593
<i>There have been some new
developments in the case.</i>

688
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:22,564
<i>We're following numerous leads.</i>

689
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,705
<i>We're asking any citizens in the
area to please call our help line.</i>

690
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:29,474
<i>1-800-COP-TIPS. Thank you.</i>

691
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:37,411
You look like you just saw a ghost.

692
00:52:40,254 --> 00:52:43,346
I'm... I'm so sorry. Can
you repeat that, please?

693
00:52:45,393 --> 00:52:46,926
Yep.

694
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:55,267
- Move. Move!
- Have a little respect, please!

695
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:57,494
Stop the van! Stop
the van right now!

696
00:52:57,605 --> 00:53:00,503
Stop the van! Stop the
fucking van right now!

697
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:03,643
What the fuck?
What kind of fucking shit...?

698
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:06,807
- I'm gonna fucking kill you! Rainn!
- What kind of fucking...?

699
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:08,914
I'm gonna kill you!

700
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:11,410
What is this, National
Impulse Day or something?

701
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,144
- Remember the time we did a couple?
- That's not the point.

702
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:15,982
We eat at that diner,
for chrissakes.

703
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,987
Sometimes you just have
to be spontaneous.

704
00:53:18,092 --> 00:53:20,820
I'd appreciate next time if
you'd give me a little warning.

705
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:22,757
I didn't even have
time for the camera.

706
00:53:23,197 --> 00:53:25,788
I feel so fucking alive right now.

707
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,524
Oh, jeez.

708
00:53:37,044 --> 00:53:38,441
What are you gonna do to us?

709
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:42,447
Blue. Blue.

710
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:47,212
Blue, blue, blue is for you, miss.
True blue. Thank you very much.

711
00:53:47,321 --> 00:53:49,946
- Blue.
- What are you gonna do to us?

712
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:55,184
Roland? Roland?

713
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:12,670
- So it worked out.
- Babe, when you're right, you're right.

714
00:54:19,887 --> 00:54:22,854
I knew you'd like that
little punky girl.

715
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:31,156
- Would you wait a minute? Shit.
- You don't even know the guy.

716
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:35,529
Which is why it's fucking important
to make a good first impression.

717
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:39,705
- First impression, huh?
- Yes.

718
00:54:40,841 --> 00:54:43,307
- I'm impressed.
- Whatever.

719
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:49,645
Who is it? Who is it?

720
00:54:51,485 --> 00:54:53,780
Lucky's here with a guest.

721
00:55:03,164 --> 00:55:04,959
Let me see your bag, miss.

722
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:08,428
Quiet.

723
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,564
And cut! Cut!

724
00:55:12,673 --> 00:55:14,832
Oh, yes.

725
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:17,135
Hot set!

726
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:22,481
Oh, my God.

727
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,947
Heaven has sent me an angel.

728
00:55:25,486 --> 00:55:29,420
Since when you walking around
with a freaking Venus, Lucky?

729
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:31,215
- Well...
- Oh, look, she's blushing.

730
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:35,786
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Angela Maria Guzmano del Lopez.

731
00:55:35,896 --> 00:55:37,930
Angie for short.

732
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,797
That means singer.

733
00:55:46,073 --> 00:55:48,073
- Look, Mendez...
- You have something for me?

734
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:50,499
That's my demo.

735
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:52,906
Don't touch that!

736
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:56,983
- This is you, honey?
- Yeah.

737
00:55:57,084 --> 00:56:01,177
Sherman! Move Breakman to 4.

738
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:03,816
Lucky, Angie.

739
00:56:04,492 --> 00:56:06,685
- Look, Mendez, so...
- Angie, come. Angie, come.

740
00:56:06,794 --> 00:56:08,623
You too, Lucky, come on.
Come, come.

741
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:13,198
Lucky, sit. Angie, sit right here.
Sit, sit. Lucky, sit, sit, sit.

742
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:15,835
Don't touch that!

743
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:19,669
Picture, picture, picture.
Lucky, please.

744
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:22,000
Lucky, come on, come on, come on.

745
00:56:22,109 --> 00:56:24,803
Okay. Lucky, don't smile.

746
00:56:25,646 --> 00:56:27,441
Yeah! Okay, okay.

747
00:56:27,548 --> 00:56:29,548
I'm gonna put you both
in a movie right now.

748
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,810
- I'll pay you $1000 each, cash.
- Mendez, you ain't gotta do that.

749
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,682
What, what, what? Come on, man.
Just do a scene with her.

750
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:38,915
You do it for free anyway, might
as well get paid, right, honey?

751
00:56:39,026 --> 00:56:41,788
- Head back.
- Is that better?

752
00:56:41,896 --> 00:56:45,124
Shake your head a little.
That's it, shake your head!

753
00:56:45,232 --> 00:56:48,460
America's so fucked
up racially, right?

754
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:52,605
Latinos are the new exotic.

755
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:55,134
I mean, look at some of
the Hollywood pictures.

756
00:56:55,242 --> 00:56:58,072
The dirty cop one, <i>Training Day.</i>
They put Denzel with...

757
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:01,214
- Eva Mendes.
- Oh, my God. Gorgeous Latina.

758
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:04,907
And then the one with the
<i>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i> kid.

759
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:06,381
- What's his name?
- Will Smith.

760
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:09,055
Yes, yes, yes. They put in
the same Latina with him.

761
00:57:09,156 --> 00:57:13,192
And then the <i>Catwoman</i> with...
I know this one. I know this one.

762
00:57:15,462 --> 00:57:17,962
Benjamin Bratt.

763
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:21,025
He put fine in fine.

764
00:57:21,135 --> 00:57:24,295
You put a black guy with a black
girl, what you got? Black movie.

765
00:57:24,405 --> 00:57:26,598
White with white?
Been there, done that.

766
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:29,901
You gotta mix it up. Make it sexy.

767
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:33,136
You know, we all fantasize
about the other, right?

768
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:36,043
- All right, cut.
- Antonio. Antonio, come here, quick!

769
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,548
Quick, quick. Antonio,
picture, picture, picture.

770
00:57:38,652 --> 00:57:40,652
Picture. Look in the camera.

771
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:44,688
Okay? You got it?
Okay, get the fuck out.

772
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,757
Latinos are safe, you see.

773
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:53,228
White folks love us, black
folks live next door to us.

774
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:55,860
Who wouldn't wanna
bang a hot Latina?

775
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,901
Unless, of course, you
was a fag like me.

776
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,073
Hey, hey, hey, look.
Mendez, Mendez. Hey.

777
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:01,571
I need a car, man.

778
00:58:01,675 --> 00:58:04,209
I need a car and I need a
place where we can hole up.

779
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:06,777
Do I owe you or do you owe me?

780
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:10,213
I'm... I'm just fucking
with you, okay?

781
00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:13,875
Look, what are you, her protector now?
She can't speak?

782
00:58:14,555 --> 00:58:15,849
- Come here, come here.
- Hey.

783
00:58:15,956 --> 00:58:18,149
Come here. Please!

784
00:58:18,926 --> 00:58:20,721
I got a guy in there, <i>mamita.</i>

785
00:58:25,165 --> 00:58:28,359
An actor's an actor. Come on,
act like you're enjoying yourselves.

786
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:33,972
Look, honestly...

787
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:37,835
I can't do anything today that
I won't be proud of tomorrow.

788
00:58:38,178 --> 00:58:40,473
- Did you hear that shit?
- Yes, girl.

789
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:41,943
Do you believe that shit?

790
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:44,117
I didn't know they still
make girls like this!

791
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:47,219
You gotta keep her here,
Lucky. Keep her, okay?

792
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:50,618
Sherman, how's the transmission
on the old Eldorado?

793
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:54,191
It's fine. You deaf prick, go
get the keys to the Eldo... Go!

794
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:57,330
Go get the keys. And to
the country place too.

795
00:58:57,431 --> 00:58:59,692
I got just the spot for you, okay?

796
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,595
It used to belong to
my wife's mother...

797
00:59:01,702 --> 00:59:03,963
back then when I
still needed a wife.

798
00:59:04,071 --> 00:59:07,004
Look, when you get back,
do me a favor, okay?

799
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:10,335
I want you to consider
letting me be her manager.

800
00:59:10,444 --> 00:59:12,034
I'll take 10 percent. Legit.

801
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:15,579
And you're never gonna have to worry
about me trying to get into your pants.

802
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:17,011
Keys!

803
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:20,450
- Ain't that the truth, Lucky?
- That's the truth.

804
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:26,323
Antonio?

805
00:59:39,506 --> 00:59:42,871
Roland? You okay?

806
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,410
Baby, you're not even...
You're not even tied up.

807
00:59:48,515 --> 00:59:52,244
Come on. Hey, untie me, okay?

808
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:54,981
Listen to me. They tossed
my handbag in here...

809
00:59:55,089 --> 00:59:56,451
when they brought us in.

810
00:59:56,557 --> 00:59:59,023
You remember the pepper
spray that you gave me?

811
00:59:59,126 --> 01:00:01,285
Remember the pepper spray?
I still have it.

812
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:04,691
- That's my superhero.
- If we're gonna fucking die...

813
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:07,492
let's just let it be on
our own terms, okay?

814
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:18,838
- Hey, hey. Who you calling?
- What, are you my man now?

815
01:00:18,946 --> 01:00:20,707
I gotta pee.

816
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:23,041
Well, I guess you better
roll the window down...

817
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:26,014
and back your ass up to the
crack and piss out the window.

818
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,815
I don't see any toilets,
and I ain't stopping.

819
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:37,055
<i>Roland, you just gotta untie me.</i>

820
01:00:37,164 --> 01:00:41,360
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry. I've never
been strong enough for you.</i>

821
01:00:41,468 --> 01:00:44,093
<i>No, you are strong enough.</i>

822
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:46,163
<i>Please, just untie me.</i>

823
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:48,773
<i>Okay? You remember the pepper
spray that you gave me?</i>

824
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:51,604
<i>Remember the pepper spray?
I still have it.</i>

825
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:55,740
Pepper spray. That's original.

826
01:00:58,252 --> 01:01:01,515
Still, you have to give
her points for spunk.

827
01:01:10,764 --> 01:01:12,695
Crazy motherfuckers.

828
01:01:23,744 --> 01:01:26,074
Stop! No!

829
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:31,507
Stop.

830
01:01:34,655 --> 01:01:38,486
I gotta pee. You've gotta stop
the car. I gotta pee really bad.

831
01:01:38,592 --> 01:01:42,321
I gotta pee, I'm serious. Please,
stop the car. I gotta pee.

832
01:01:42,563 --> 01:01:44,062
All right.

833
01:01:45,232 --> 01:01:47,391
I'm gonna pee all over
the car in a second.

834
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:49,296
Please, stop the car.
Just stop the car.

835
01:01:49,403 --> 01:01:52,438
- You gonna be real chilly if...
- Stop the car. Stop the car, please.

836
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:54,129
I gotta pee.

837
01:01:57,544 --> 01:01:59,874
Oh, God.

838
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,519
Don't look.

839
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:25,767
<i>You've reached Solly Sol, the man.</i>

840
01:02:25,873 --> 01:02:29,602
<i>Time is money, so
make it quick, money.</i>

841
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:45,385
Yeah.

842
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:47,287
A friend of yours just
came by to visit.

843
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:51,931
- Who might that be?
- Lucky and his new girlfriend.

844
01:02:52,032 --> 01:02:54,191
What a doll.

845
01:02:59,206 --> 01:03:01,433
- No more cellphone.
- What the fuck?

846
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:03,906
GPS. Could be tracking us.

847
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:06,744
From now on, we going off grid.
They wanna track us...

848
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:08,710
they can track that
shit up to Canada.

849
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:10,815
Thank you, folks, for coming.

850
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:13,680
All the ballistics at the strip
club have been accounted for.

851
01:03:13,787 --> 01:03:17,152
- Meaning what?
- It seems Lucky didn't shoot anybody.

852
01:03:17,257 --> 01:03:19,848
Not yet anyway. What about
the Canadian border?

853
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,756
They didn't show.
Neither did the girl.

854
01:03:24,164 --> 01:03:27,290
- It's got mayonnaise in it, man.
- I told those jokers you wanted soy.

855
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:29,526
Well, check it out next
time, will you? Shit.

856
01:03:29,636 --> 01:03:32,068
- What about Franklin?
- Still tracking his every move.

857
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:35,264
- Hey, can I have your sandwich?
- Yeah, yeah. Knock yourself out.

858
01:03:36,743 --> 01:03:39,710
I think I better change
your bandage, Kojak.

859
01:03:39,846 --> 01:03:41,937
Bandage is fine.

860
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:46,646
You was fucking Sol, wasn't you?

861
01:03:46,753 --> 01:03:49,481
- Say what?
- You was boning him, right?

862
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:54,050
That night, you was supposed to be
the getaway driver, wasn't you?

863
01:03:54,161 --> 01:03:57,162
No. We didn't need a getaway
until you fucked things up.

864
01:03:57,264 --> 01:04:01,266
I didn't fuck things up. The whole
scenario was a setup. Sol was a fink.

865
01:04:01,368 --> 01:04:04,562
Gino was in with the cops, and they
was running the shake-and-take.

866
01:04:05,872 --> 01:04:08,065
Don't worry about Sol
returning your phone calls.

867
01:04:08,175 --> 01:04:11,836
- What?
- They popped him. He's dead.

868
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:24,222
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

869
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:29,461
Sometimes in life, it seems like
if you don't have bad luck...

870
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:34,022
- ...you don't have no luck at all.
- No.

871
01:04:34,134 --> 01:04:38,568
No, I did not sleep
with Sol and no.

872
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:43,209
- Whatever. It don't matter.
- What? No, it matters to me.

873
01:04:43,443 --> 01:04:46,341
I know that you think
because I'm a stripper...

874
01:04:46,446 --> 01:04:49,743
that I sleep with everybody,
but that's not the case.

875
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:52,976
- Sol was just an acquaintance.
- Or just a friend, right?

876
01:04:53,086 --> 01:04:55,984
Yes. I mean, you know, he gave
me paper every now and then...

877
01:04:56,089 --> 01:04:58,953
but to tell the truth, he was
more intent on impressing you.

878
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:02,390
He used to say that you
were a true player.

879
01:05:02,496 --> 01:05:05,292
You know, an original gangster.

880
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,163
Original gangster. Player.

881
01:05:11,338 --> 01:05:14,839
Well, the frog's in a well,
and rat's in a cage.

882
01:05:15,142 --> 01:05:17,267
What does that mean?

883
01:05:17,878 --> 01:05:20,139
It means all of these player
gangsters out here...

884
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:22,474
they get so caught up
in their own fantasy...

885
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:26,209
that they can't see the real picture.
See, they think they running shit.

886
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,944
They ain't running shit. More
likely they running in shit.

887
01:05:29,056 --> 01:05:31,249
They just can't smell it though.

888
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:36,657
Look, I did things. I was grimy.
I hustled, I scrambled, I did all of that.

889
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:39,659
At one point I thought
the world was mine.

890
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:44,132
And then I realized, oh, man,
I got caught in a trick.

891
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:48,296
Trick had me killing my own
people, killing myself.

892
01:05:49,676 --> 01:05:53,143
Probably killed more black
people than the Ku Klux Klan.

893
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:58,073
So you're trying to find
your way out of hell.

894
01:05:58,185 --> 01:06:00,947
I can't find my way out of shit.

895
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:04,749
And anybody who follows
me is foolish.

896
01:06:06,526 --> 01:06:08,526
Including you.

897
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:40,121
<i>And now authorities are offering a
$200,000 reward for the capture...</i>

898
01:06:40,227 --> 01:06:42,227
<i>- ...of the Sawtooth Killers.</i>
- Just pick one.

899
01:06:52,472 --> 01:06:54,938
Fuck you. Life's too
short to be evil.

900
01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:34,307
Wait up, bitch! Shit.

901
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:38,014
- How much further?
- How the hell should I know?

902
01:07:38,118 --> 01:07:42,245
Probably could have been there if you
hadn't given the damn car a seizure.

903
01:07:43,256 --> 01:07:45,290
What? What?

904
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:48,284
Put that shit away.

905
01:07:48,962 --> 01:07:50,757
My ankle.

906
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:55,462
- Can you come help me, please?
- I told you about them cute-ass shoes.

907
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:01,203
Just help me up, please.

908
01:08:02,976 --> 01:08:05,636
- You can't walk at all?
- No.

909
01:08:09,082 --> 01:08:12,447
Damn. Come on.

910
01:08:12,686 --> 01:08:14,913
- Oh, wait.
- Here.

911
01:08:15,021 --> 01:08:17,282
- Here, you hold this.
- Okay.

912
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,253
I'm watching you.

913
01:08:19,693 --> 01:08:21,385
Damn.

914
01:08:24,764 --> 01:08:26,991
Jesus.

915
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,402
Keep going. Come on.

916
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:36,637
- You hear something?
- Like what?

917
01:08:36,743 --> 01:08:38,811
I thought I heard something.

918
01:08:40,313 --> 01:08:42,313
Maybe it's nothing.

919
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:44,612
Don't start freaking me out, Lucky.

920
01:08:44,717 --> 01:08:47,048
Seriously, I don't like
that <i>Blair Witch-</i>type shit.

921
01:08:47,153 --> 01:08:49,653
Yeah, but I bet you like biscuits.

922
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:02,632
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

923
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:08,299
Here, I see something.

924
01:09:13,613 --> 01:09:15,874
I think...

925
01:09:18,184 --> 01:09:22,482
- I think this is it.
- You're kidding, right?

926
01:09:23,356 --> 01:09:26,721
Look, you just stay here, all right?
I'm gonna go check things out.

927
01:09:26,826 --> 01:09:30,726
Wait, Lucky. Seriously,
this doesn't feel right.

928
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:52,510
Damn. No light.

929
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:56,147
Okay. I'll see if I
can find a light.

930
01:09:58,325 --> 01:10:00,689
See if that telephone works.

931
01:10:02,162 --> 01:10:03,820
I should've left my ass in Jersey.

932
01:10:05,298 --> 01:10:08,856
No, there's no dial tone.
There's no dial tone.

933
01:10:10,036 --> 01:10:11,797
Where are you going?

934
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:13,799
Lucky.

935
01:10:13,907 --> 01:10:16,669
I'm almost positive I've
seen it here before.

936
01:10:17,143 --> 01:10:19,609
A blue van.

937
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:24,981
I would've called earlier, but
Fred said, "Don't get involved."

938
01:10:27,387 --> 01:10:31,389
He's got irritable bowels.
You know how it is.

939
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:35,118
Yeah, yeah, I know how that is.
Well, Ethel, I wanna thank you.

940
01:10:35,228 --> 01:10:37,660
You know, you may
have saved a life.

941
01:10:38,298 --> 01:10:40,127
And, Fred, I wanna thank you too.

942
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:44,292
Did you hear that, Fred? The young
man said I was a lifesaver.

943
01:10:44,604 --> 01:10:47,798
- Whose wife?
- Oh, come on.

944
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:51,772
Why is it as women get older,
their hair gets shorter...

945
01:10:51,878 --> 01:10:54,276
and their jewelry gets bigger?

946
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:59,348
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah, captain, it's Lee.</i>

947
01:10:59,452 --> 01:11:01,543
- <i>You in the field?</i>
- No, I'm in the office.

948
01:11:01,654 --> 01:11:04,723
You wanted me to notify you when
we had any movement on Franklin.

949
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:07,358
- Yeah, so where is he?
- <i>North, at the old Sawtooth mill.</i>

950
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,428
- You're positive.
- Yeah, yeah. You want me to handle it?

951
01:11:11,531 --> 01:11:13,963
No, no. I'll do this myself.

952
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:15,930
Fellas, you call me
if anything comes up.

953
01:11:16,036 --> 01:11:17,865
- Anything, all right?
- You got it.

954
01:11:22,776 --> 01:11:25,367
All right, tough guy.

955
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:29,979
Pull up some paper there.
I'll go out and get the firewood.

956
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,354
Leave the lamp.

957
01:11:47,534 --> 01:11:49,727
Oh, and the briefcase too.

958
01:11:55,341 --> 01:11:57,272
Humor me?

959
01:12:42,722 --> 01:12:45,848
I always wanted to go
sledding as a kid.

960
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:49,525
Rosebud.

961
01:12:52,732 --> 01:12:56,165
- Like in <i>Citizen Kane?</i>
- Who?

962
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:58,835
Forget it.

963
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:03,465
Okay.

964
01:13:04,978 --> 01:13:08,206
- Put the paper in first.
- No, you put the wood in first.

965
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:12,475
- No, no. You put the paper in first.
- No, the wood.

966
01:13:15,155 --> 01:13:17,485
Dumb black guy don't know shit.

967
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,521
- What?
- Exactly.

968
01:13:19,626 --> 01:13:23,287
So don't go acting all high and mighty
just because you saw a couple of films.

969
01:13:23,396 --> 01:13:26,158
I'm bilingual. You're
just <i>uno</i> Ebonical.

970
01:13:38,678 --> 01:13:44,410
Okay. See, keep it up, I'm not gonna
let you sleep with me tonight.

971
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:49,586
That's fucked up. You're trying to
scare your way into some pussy.

972
01:13:49,689 --> 01:13:51,689
On the contrary, baby.
I don't want none.

973
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:54,792
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really. Yeah.

974
01:13:54,894 --> 01:13:57,622
Because you way too much drama...

975
01:14:20,353 --> 01:14:21,647
Lucky?

976
01:14:21,754 --> 01:14:24,345
Yeah, I'm looking for
something for us to eat.

977
01:14:25,491 --> 01:14:27,957
Will you let me whup you
in some checkers later?

978
01:14:42,508 --> 01:14:44,769
It's... Get down.

979
01:15:34,027 --> 01:15:35,355
Bitch.

980
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:44,497
Bitch!

981
01:15:56,316 --> 01:15:59,283
Okay. You're gonna
be all right, baby.

982
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:02,045
- I gotta get you some help.
- No, don't leave me.

983
01:16:02,155 --> 01:16:03,745
Look, here.

984
01:16:06,326 --> 01:16:08,451
You keep this with you.

985
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:10,055
Yeah.

986
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:11,730
Now, I saw a farmhouse nearby.

987
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:13,762
I'm gonna go there and
use their phone...

988
01:16:13,866 --> 01:16:16,992
call for an ambulance. Okay?

989
01:16:19,572 --> 01:16:21,003
Lucky?

990
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:24,203
Yeah, I got you, baby. I got you.

991
01:16:26,012 --> 01:16:27,704
Leave the briefcase?

992
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:32,781
I wanna know you're coming back.

993
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:37,745
Of course I'm coming back.
Of course.

994
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:42,824
But I mean, what if
somebody else shows up?

995
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:45,930
Then you're passed out
and then the money...

996
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,661
Come on. Well, I think I'll...

997
01:16:51,604 --> 01:16:54,229
- I'll hide it somewhere.
- Please?

998
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:58,504
Okay. Okay.

999
01:17:00,012 --> 01:17:01,875
I'll be back.

1000
01:17:11,858 --> 01:17:13,721
You just said, "The ass of a rat."

1001
01:17:16,396 --> 01:17:18,327
You teach me later.

1002
01:17:21,634 --> 01:17:22,928
Don't go nowhere.

1003
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:19,757
Babe, I'll tell you what.

1004
01:18:22,028 --> 01:18:23,959
You can fuck her first.

1005
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:26,195
Really?

1006
01:18:26,299 --> 01:18:27,991
Flip for it?

1007
01:18:29,635 --> 01:18:30,963
No.

1008
01:18:31,204 --> 01:18:33,329
I'm in a watching kind of mood.

1009
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:36,064
Then you can have the first cut.

1010
01:18:37,977 --> 01:18:39,567
Deal.

1011
01:19:04,504 --> 01:19:07,334
Just imagine the worst possible
things you can imagine.

1012
01:19:07,807 --> 01:19:11,843
When we're done, you're gonna know
how poor your imagination really is.

1013
01:19:28,027 --> 01:19:30,152
Shit. Hey, babe? Babe?

1014
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:32,520
- What?
- We gotta deal with this.

1015
01:19:33,432 --> 01:19:36,399
Eugene's blasting the TV. This
joker's gonna know someone's home.

1016
01:19:36,802 --> 01:19:38,233
Don't people know any better...

1017
01:19:38,337 --> 01:19:40,928
than to just drop in like that?

1018
01:19:44,844 --> 01:19:47,344
Please. I'm so sorry to bother you.

1019
01:19:47,446 --> 01:19:50,913
We just had an accident in my place
across the way and the phone's out.

1020
01:19:51,017 --> 01:19:53,312
Could you call an ambulance for us?

1021
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:57,881
I thought that belonged
to that mobster. Mendez?

1022
01:19:59,392 --> 01:20:00,925
Really?

1023
01:20:01,027 --> 01:20:03,755
Well, he just let us
borrow it for a while.

1024
01:20:03,863 --> 01:20:05,487
I really need your help.

1025
01:20:07,633 --> 01:20:08,722
Come on in.

1026
01:20:08,834 --> 01:20:10,367
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1027
01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:12,298
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1028
01:20:12,939 --> 01:20:14,233
Have a seat.

1029
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,102
- Would you like a cookie or some tea?
- No, thank you.

1030
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:19,402
- I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Of course.

1031
01:20:19,512 --> 01:20:21,239
I'll get the phone right away.

1032
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:25,208
Hey, hey, hey. Are you out
of your fricking mind?

1033
01:20:25,318 --> 01:20:27,579
Go with me on this one, Walter.

1034
01:20:30,723 --> 01:20:34,156
Lee, I passed the Sawtooth mill
twice, man. What the fuck?

1035
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,588
<i>I... I don't know, captain.</i>

1036
01:20:35,695 --> 01:20:37,285
<i>Franklin's truck's gotta be there.</i>

1037
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:39,054
<i>GPS says you're right
on top of him.</i>

1038
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:45,532
Thank you.

1039
01:20:45,638 --> 01:20:48,206
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

1040
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:50,272
I really appreciate this.

1041
01:20:55,881 --> 01:20:57,949
This is not working.

1042
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:00,414
That would be because
I disconnected it.

1043
01:21:06,258 --> 01:21:09,521
Now, this I do not understand.

1044
01:21:22,408 --> 01:21:24,339
Police. Put your gun down.

1045
01:21:24,443 --> 01:21:25,532
Put the shit down!

1046
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:34,709
Where's Lucky?

1047
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,820
Probably in Mexico by now.

1048
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:40,956
<i>First...</i>

1049
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,787
<i>there was a note.</i>

1050
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:47,196
<i>Then there is no note.</i>

1051
01:21:47,299 --> 01:21:50,527
What the fuck is going on?

1052
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:52,731
<i>They killed Roland.</i>

1053
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:57,336
- They can hear everything you say.
- <i>All in your mind.</i>

1054
01:21:57,877 --> 01:21:59,410
<i>Good.</i>

1055
01:22:00,246 --> 01:22:02,337
<i>Because I have had
a bad fucking day.</i>

1056
01:22:02,515 --> 01:22:06,346
<i>And all these motherfuckers are
gonna do is keep pissing me off.</i>

1057
01:22:06,452 --> 01:22:08,986
- <i>Illusion.</i>
- There's never a need for name-calling.

1058
01:22:09,088 --> 01:22:11,486
What is meant to be is meant to be.

1059
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:13,555
<i>We're all the children...</i>

1060
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:15,386
<i>of the universe.</i>

1061
01:22:16,929 --> 01:22:19,725
<i>Breathe deeply.</i>

1062
01:22:23,602 --> 01:22:26,500
They set us up to escape and
they just came right in...

1063
01:22:26,605 --> 01:22:28,673
and they slit his throat.
He's a fighter.

1064
01:22:28,774 --> 01:22:31,775
We were supposed to go to New
York. And they just killed him.

1065
01:22:31,877 --> 01:22:35,504
<i>Hey, hey. Look. You're gonna have
to keep it together now, all right?</i>

1066
01:22:35,681 --> 01:22:38,272
<i>Just keep it together.
Hold it together.</i>

1067
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,777
Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

1068
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:11,449
That's right. Turn up, look at me.

1069
01:23:11,884 --> 01:23:13,884
How you doing, black?
What's up, man?

1070
01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:15,280
What's going on?

1071
01:23:15,387 --> 01:23:17,250
Oh, you looking... What? What?

1072
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:19,390
What? Don't you know
what time it is, bro?

1073
01:23:19,492 --> 01:23:23,119
I don't think you know what time it is!
Don't you know what time it is?

1074
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:25,126
It's showtime, motherfuckers!

1075
01:23:25,231 --> 01:23:27,390
Your loss.

1076
01:23:38,911 --> 01:23:40,740
What the fuck is this?

1077
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:47,346
Hey, hey, hey. Are we in Mexico?

1078
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:07,830
Man, if you want an audition...

1079
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:11,737
I can get you audition in
WWF or something, man.

1080
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:14,071
You need to let me go, man.

1081
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:25,518
Two points!

1082
01:24:41,507 --> 01:24:43,040
You're not turning your punches.

1083
01:24:46,011 --> 01:24:47,806
Stop tape!

1084
01:24:53,085 --> 01:24:54,675
What are you talking about?

1085
01:24:56,589 --> 01:25:00,352
You're not pronating your punches.

1086
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:03,655
Listen, man.

1087
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:05,988
I've studied martial
arts for 17 years.

1088
01:25:06,098 --> 01:25:08,860
So don't you fucking criticize
my technique, okay?

1089
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:12,900
Always with a guy tied to a chair?

1090
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:16,173
Oh, yeah. So I suppose you
want me to let you go, right?

1091
01:25:16,275 --> 01:25:18,070
If you were a man, you'd untie him.

1092
01:25:18,177 --> 01:25:20,006
Oh, shit!

1093
01:25:20,112 --> 01:25:22,737
Bill is back in the game!
Check that out, Cass.

1094
01:25:22,848 --> 01:25:24,540
That's so cute.

1095
01:25:26,785 --> 01:25:28,318
Where are we going?

1096
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,181
I'm getting you to a hospital.

1097
01:25:30,289 --> 01:25:33,358
That fucker said he was
going to get help.

1098
01:25:33,459 --> 01:25:35,117
He left me.

1099
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,693
No, haven't I tried?
Have we done that before?

1100
01:25:37,796 --> 01:25:39,386
You know, it's cool because...

1101
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:45,870
If I can get him to knock this
chair over one more time...

1102
01:25:46,472 --> 01:25:49,234
I can be free out of
this motherfucker.

1103
01:25:51,343 --> 01:25:54,037
- No. No, they will not.
- Oh, yes, they will.

1104
01:26:07,693 --> 01:26:09,590
I was saying...

1105
01:26:10,195 --> 01:26:12,889
Hey, look. Before you introduce
me to Mr. Pinkie there...

1106
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:15,726
I don't suppose I could
interest you in a...

1107
01:26:15,968 --> 01:26:19,595
suitcase full of money, could I?

1108
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:22,036
Well, I guess not.

1109
01:26:22,608 --> 01:26:24,539
You wouldn't be interested
in the money...

1110
01:26:24,643 --> 01:26:26,938
seeing how you and your
friend get your kicks.

1111
01:26:27,046 --> 01:26:31,276
Coupled with the fact that a suitcase
full of money and a black man...

1112
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:34,452
Yeah, it's highly likely that there'd
be a strong police presence.

1113
01:26:35,888 --> 01:26:38,650
- In the not-too-distant future.
- Ignore him, babe.

1114
01:26:38,757 --> 01:26:40,290
Yeah, yeah.

1115
01:26:40,426 --> 01:26:43,518
Why don't you let Bruce Lee
Light call all the shots?

1116
01:26:45,097 --> 01:26:48,132
Do not provoke me.

1117
01:26:49,301 --> 01:26:50,732
Look...

1118
01:26:51,337 --> 01:26:53,667
I got a shitload of
money in a suitcase.

1119
01:26:53,772 --> 01:26:55,430
I stashed it in a pickup truck.

1120
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:56,767
Cut, cut, cut!

1121
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:59,205
What is the first fucking rule?

1122
01:26:59,311 --> 01:27:01,276
Do not let these tricks
get to you, babe!

1123
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,777
Don't talk to me like that.

1124
01:27:02,982 --> 01:27:05,346
And they've got all those
dead cars out there anyway.

1125
01:27:05,451 --> 01:27:08,145
Yeah, yeah, Bruce.
What do you gotta lose?

1126
01:27:08,252 --> 01:27:09,877
Go check.

1127
01:27:15,594 --> 01:27:16,820
I'll tell you this, bro.

1128
01:27:16,929 --> 01:27:19,429
You got a lot to lose, man.

1129
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:33,338
What are you gonna do? Torture me?

1130
01:27:33,445 --> 01:27:35,979
Oh, there's torture.

1131
01:27:36,482 --> 01:27:40,382
And then there's torture.

1132
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:46,223
You think this is my week
away from the family?

1133
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:50,924
I know you but you don't know me.

1134
01:27:51,764 --> 01:27:53,729
How many times have we
passed in the mall?

1135
01:27:53,832 --> 01:27:55,923
You listen to that
gangster-rap shit...

1136
01:27:56,234 --> 01:27:57,666
thinking you're hard.

1137
01:27:59,104 --> 01:28:02,503
And you, with that
little, punky hair...

1138
01:28:02,608 --> 01:28:04,334
always with the cruel remarks.

1139
01:28:04,843 --> 01:28:09,277
"Look at the bitch with the
retarded child." All of you.

1140
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:13,047
Hurting Eugene all the
time he was a baby.

1141
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:18,720
But I make you pay.

1142
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:21,090
Don't I?

1143
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,988
Do you ever fucking learn?

1144
01:28:27,066 --> 01:28:29,134
You think you know pain?

1145
01:28:30,402 --> 01:28:34,029
Abu Ghraib ain't got nothing on us.

1146
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:36,867
I'll show you pain.

1147
01:28:39,645 --> 01:28:41,542
She's so intense.

1148
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:44,413
Hey. What about the money?

1149
01:28:49,221 --> 01:28:51,016
- Yeah, what about the money?
- The money?

1150
01:28:51,123 --> 01:28:52,588
Yeah. Remember?

1151
01:28:53,025 --> 01:28:56,218
The truck. Five minutes
away, outside?

1152
01:28:56,328 --> 01:28:58,453
What the hell do you
expect to get in return?

1153
01:28:58,564 --> 01:29:00,393
Well, sh... Look.

1154
01:29:00,499 --> 01:29:04,091
Hey, you let me go and
I'll get you more of it.

1155
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:08,236
How about I take the
money, kill you...

1156
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,965
and don't worry about
if there's any more?

1157
01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:14,610
Underneath the hood.

1158
01:29:20,786 --> 01:29:23,320
So, what is it with you and Lucky?

1159
01:29:25,057 --> 01:29:27,318
We got a little history together.

1160
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,823
I got time.

1161
01:29:30,762 --> 01:29:33,695
Your boy, Lucky,
ruined a lot of lives.

1162
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:38,133
A lot of lives.

1163
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:40,629
Justice was never done.

1164
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:43,832
This time it will be.

1165
01:29:52,651 --> 01:29:54,981
- Combination?
- It's not locked.

1166
01:29:57,289 --> 01:29:59,949
Oh, wait... Wait a minute, babe.

1167
01:30:00,559 --> 01:30:02,752
Let's get this shit on tape.

1168
01:30:15,674 --> 01:30:17,298
Okay.

1169
01:30:25,651 --> 01:30:28,218
- Are you ready yet?
- I'm all set, babe.

1170
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,926
Holy shit, Walter.
I think it's real.

1171
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,829
No, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1172
01:31:40,392 --> 01:31:43,393
- You expect me to beg?
- No.

1173
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:45,294
I expect you to scream.

1174
01:31:57,709 --> 01:32:00,573
- Yeah.
- <i>Lucky just called TIPS.</i>

1175
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:03,612
- What?
- <i>Yeah. He wants to speak with you.</i>

1176
01:32:03,715 --> 01:32:06,579
Run a trace. I'll try
to keep him talking.

1177
01:32:07,219 --> 01:32:09,446
- Put him through.
- <i>Hey, Davis.</i>

1178
01:32:09,554 --> 01:32:11,645
I got something you want.

1179
01:32:12,357 --> 01:32:14,015
No more fucking deals this time.

1180
01:32:14,126 --> 01:32:15,887
The Sawtooth Killers.

1181
01:32:15,993 --> 01:32:18,084
You know the Sawtooth Killers?

1182
01:32:18,697 --> 01:32:21,698
Yeah. I thought that
might shut you up.

1183
01:32:21,933 --> 01:32:23,660
Well, I got the motherfuckers.

1184
01:32:23,769 --> 01:32:25,996
- Why should I trust you?
- <i>Why should I trust you?</i>

1185
01:32:26,104 --> 01:32:28,536
Come here, you'll see for yourself.

1186
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,173
Bring an ambulance, all right?

1187
01:32:30,475 --> 01:32:32,543
- Yeah, where are you?
- <i>Oh, man, come on.</i>

1188
01:32:32,644 --> 01:32:34,644
Come on, man.
Sh... like you don't know.

1189
01:32:36,682 --> 01:32:38,443
- Lee, got that?
- <i>You won't believe it.</i>

1190
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:40,277
- <i>He's back where you came from.</i>
- What?

1191
01:32:40,385 --> 01:32:42,953
<i>The old farmhouse, five minutes
away, north of the mill.</i>

1192
01:32:43,055 --> 01:32:44,383
- <i>Can you get there?</i>
- Yeah.

1193
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:47,956
- <i>All right. I'll get the guys in motion.</i>
- I'm on it.

1194
01:33:12,751 --> 01:33:14,216
About time.

1195
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:17,445
Look. The Sawtooth Killers?

1196
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:19,513
You wanna see?

1197
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:21,019
Right over there.

1198
01:33:25,364 --> 01:33:27,227
Yeah. Right there.

1199
01:33:28,767 --> 01:33:32,234
That crazy bitch. And the Mexican.

1200
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,369
They murdered my boyfriend.

1201
01:33:38,076 --> 01:33:40,906
- They were gonna kill us next.
- Who are you?

1202
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:43,609
Rainn Bentley.

1203
01:33:44,082 --> 01:33:46,082
This man saved my life.

1204
01:33:46,618 --> 01:33:48,777
Look, they even filmed their shit.

1205
01:33:48,887 --> 01:33:51,512
All the crazy shit they
do, they got it on tape.

1206
01:33:52,124 --> 01:33:54,419
They got it caught on tape.
Right in there.

1207
01:33:55,026 --> 01:33:57,617
- I gotta go.
- Hey.

1208
01:33:57,729 --> 01:33:59,194
Hold up.

1209
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:01,095
Think this makes things even?

1210
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,765
Look, hey, man. Look, I got
a woman I gotta go to.

1211
01:34:03,868 --> 01:34:04,936
Who's that, Angela?

1212
01:34:07,706 --> 01:34:09,433
She's outside.

1213
01:34:18,049 --> 01:34:20,140
Mama!

1214
01:34:36,067 --> 01:34:37,156
Crazy motherfucker!

1215
01:34:57,789 --> 01:34:58,947
All right.

1216
01:35:00,692 --> 01:35:02,760
I'll have the charges
against you dropped.

1217
01:35:05,764 --> 01:35:07,422
I'll get you an ambulance.

1218
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,000
Go on.

1219
01:35:14,573 --> 01:35:16,300
Solid.

1220
01:35:23,281 --> 01:35:24,814
Hey.

1221
01:35:26,284 --> 01:35:28,579
Hey, it's over. Come on.

1222
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:30,584
Come on up. It's over.

1223
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:33,582
It's over, all right?

1224
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:35,589
Okay, come on.

1225
01:35:36,627 --> 01:35:38,457
Okay.

1226
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:55,837
I trusted you and you
didn't come back.

1227
01:35:55,947 --> 01:35:57,487
- Baby, I was...
- Where's the money?

1228
01:35:57,582 --> 01:36:00,845
- The money? I was... It was...
- Oh, you're purple! Hell, no!

1229
01:36:13,798 --> 01:36:16,560
<i>Well, when I look back on it...</i>

1230
01:36:16,668 --> 01:36:20,329
<i>that was the luckiest day
in an unlucky man's life.</i>

1231
01:36:20,438 --> 01:36:23,166
- <i>Tell them about the money, baby.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1232
01:36:23,275 --> 01:36:28,312
<i>And as luck would have
it, me and Angela...</i>

1233
01:36:28,446 --> 01:36:32,744
<i>collected that $200,000
reward money too.</i>

1234
01:36:33,984 --> 01:36:35,643
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

1235
01:36:36,054 --> 01:36:37,950
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
