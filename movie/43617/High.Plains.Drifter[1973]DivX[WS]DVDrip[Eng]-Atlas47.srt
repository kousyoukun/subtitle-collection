Kickin?my own people out of my own hotel.

这一切全在我们镇内搞

424
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:51,906

It sounds like a good idea bringin?everything out in the open.

Theyre probably all three blind drunk in some Nogales whorehouse.
他们三人可能已醉卧奴基镇妓寨

他们若醉倒于奴基镇

Whats the matter, Morgan? Anybody special turn on you?
摩根，什么事？

433
00:49:13,964 --> 00:49:17,756
有人向你挑情吗？

434
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:20,522
- You want to spell that out, Drake? - Spell it yourself.

妈的！别用这种口吻跟我说话

我喜欢怎说你奈我如何？

439
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:31,638

我是公司负责人，有权发表言论

440

Whats the matter? Not gettin? your fair share ofthe profits?
说吧，你定会后悔的

441
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:35,061
摩根，你没分到合理的利润吗？

442
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:36,718
Its not the profits.
利润？那不是利润

443
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,798
This whole business has gone sour...

since that deal with that former marshal, Duncan.
公司生意日渐衰弱

We had no choice in that matter and you know it.
你应知道，那时候我们别无选择

446
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:48,005
The big mistake was hiring that man Duncan in the fi rst place.
老友，等一会

447
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,446
最大的错误是当日雇用那邓肯

448
00:49:48,087 --> 00:49:51,682
You did that all by yourself. Quiet! Shut up.
此事由你一人自把自为

在这时候噤若寒蝉呢？

Same reason everybody else did in this town.
同一理由，全镇人也涉及此事

454
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:10,881
One hangs, we all hang.

Now, you just grit your teeth a little bit longer.
你要继续咬紧牙关

456

The gunfi ghter stays till I say otherwise. You understand?
直至那枪手离去，明白吗？

457
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:30,317
There it is, just like he said.

458
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:33,001
That strangers got everybody turnin?on everybody.
那神秘人令到各人混熟

459

460
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:37,604

发生什么事？

464
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,438
Theyre emptying my whole hotel.
教士，你看像去哪里呢？

465
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:51,844
他们将我旅馆的物件搬清

466
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:53,518
Throwing out payin?guests, right into the street...
皆因要空出房间给新来的 保护者

467
00:50:53,607 --> 00:50:56,565
just to make room for our new guardian angel.

468
00:50:55,872 --> 00:51:01,582
他是喜欢独断独行的

469
00:50:57,527 --> 00:51:00,246
He likes to be by himself, more or less.

470
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:03,686
You can see whos runnin?our town now.

473
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:11,520

474
00:51:12,287 --> 00:51:14,403
Mordecai...
摩迪加， 你总有一天会被人践踏

475
00:51:15,847 --> 00:51:18,998
someday soon someones going to step on your scrawny neck, you lizard.

你不能要市民夜宿街头

478
00:51:23,087 --> 00:51:25,078

00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:46,187
大部分都是

485
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:49,203
Then you wont mind ifthey stay at your place, will ya?

486
00:51:47,531 --> 00:51:51,323
你介意他们到你的地方逗留吗？

491
00:52:08,277 --> 00:52:12,069
收费绝不会贵过旅馆的房间

492
