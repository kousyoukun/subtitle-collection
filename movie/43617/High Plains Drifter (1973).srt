1
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,730
Yah! Let's go, buster.

2
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,650
Beer.

3
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,320
And a bottle.

4
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,690
Ain't much good.

5
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,530
It's all there is.

6
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,630
Will you want anything else?

7
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,170
Just a peaceful hour to drink it in.

8
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,830
Flea-bitten range bums
don't usually stop in lago.

9
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,420
Life here's a little too quick for them.

10
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,140
Maybe you think you're fast
enough to keep up with us, huh?

11
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,370
A lot faster than you'll ever live to be.

12
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,900
Yes, sir?

13
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,360
Shave and a hot bath?

14
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,240
That'll be 90 cents.

15
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,640
Cash.

16
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,970
Well, what I mean to say is that
the 90 cents usually comes first.

17
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,180
But, hell, it don't really matter.

18
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,690
Before or after, what's the diff?

19
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,690
Sir.

20
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,210
Eau de lilac's only 10 cents more.

21
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,840
Lilac water. Oh, the ladies love it.

22
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,750
Shall we make it an even dollar? Hmm. No.

23
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,890
Yes.

24
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,570
Moses.

25
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,670
Right you are, gentlemen.

26
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,340
Be right with you. Just have a chair.

27
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,100
What, you don't like our company?

28
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,270
What's the matter with you?

29
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm speaking to you, pig shit.

30
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,030
I think he's got some of
that pig shit in his ear.

31
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,990
I don't know which smells worse,
him or the shit in the bottle.

32
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,910
What did you say your name was again?

33
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,580
I didn't.

34
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,040
No. I guess you didn't at that, did you?

35
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,370
Why don't you watch where you're going?

36
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,540
Look at this. It's ruined.

37
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,670
There's no need for all that.

38
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
All what?

39
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,090
If you want to get acquainted,
why don't you just say so?

40
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,510
Acquainted?

41
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,770
Why, you'd be amusing
if you weren't so pathetic.

42
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,310
Just a minute. I'm not
finished with you yet.

43
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,070
You know, at a distance,
you'd almost pass for a man.

44
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,860
But you're certainly a
disappointment up close, aren't you?

45
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,410
To your feet, ma'am. They're
almost as big as your mouth.

46
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,790
You know what you are? Hmm?

47
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,750
Just trash.

48
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,670
A bottle of whiskey for courage
and the manners of a goat.

49
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
You're the one who could
use a lesson in manners.

50
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,970
Not from you, whiskey breath.

51
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,640
Let go of me!

52
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,640
Let go!

53
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,400
Let go of me!

54
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,440
Let go of me, you! Put me down!

55
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,490
Help me!

56
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,950
What are you doing?

57
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,560
What are you doing? What are you doing?

58
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,020
My horse.

59
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,150
A room.

60
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,240
Would you like to register, please, sir?

61
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,400
Somebody, please help me.

62
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Damn you all to hell.

63
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,580
Good morning. Sleep well? Yeah.

64
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,080
Say, are you planning to stay,

65
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,910
keep your room another night?

66
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,540
I'll let you know.

67
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,210
All right, anything you say.

68
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,070
Morning.

69
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,900
I've still got a bath coming.

70
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,520
Nice hot bath coming right up. Yes, sir.

71
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,320
Mordecai, you put some more
hot water in that tub there.

72
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,490
This gentleman wants a bath.

73
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,570
You can hang your clothes
right down there on the peg.

74
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,290
Now, Miss Peekins does a nice...
Oh, I'm sorry.

75
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,620
Right this way, Captain, sir.

76
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,460
Unless you want Mordecai to take them out

77
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,960
and get them laundered
while you're soaking.

78
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,750
Miss Peekins does
a right clean boiled wash.

79
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,460
Uses lye for pants rabbits, she does.
No itch, no scratch.

80
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,640
Well, pour the water, Mordecai,
before it gets cold.

81
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,020
We want the gentleman to be comfortable.

82
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,170
Well, I've been wanting to talk to you.

83
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,010
I might as well get this stool here

84
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,380
and set right down and do it, right?

85
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,140
If that's all right with you, huh?

86
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,780
Well, what's it about is Billy Borders.

87
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,530
Don't know the man.

88
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,580
Well, you missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.

89
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,330
Him and lke Sharp and Fred Morris.

90
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,090
You know, those are just the
names, in case you're interested.

91
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,300
Well, I'm not really interested, Sheriff.

92
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,970
Well, I can't say I blame you, you know.

93
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,600
Billy, he wasn't a loved man, no.

94
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,220
And he didn't have much personality.

95
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,520
What he did have was all bad, just bad.

96
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,400
What you're trying to say is
there's no charge, right?

97
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,860
Uh...

98
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,360
Well, forgive and forget, you know.

99
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,110
That's our motto.

100
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,410
You dirty bastard!

101
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,330
I'll kill you!

102
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,170
Damn it, Callie!

103
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,260
Callie, damn it!

104
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,800
Let go of me, you fat lug!

105
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,140
Stop... Ouch!

106
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,890
Tell him I'd appreciate it

107
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,650
if he doesn't leave town
until I talk to him.

108
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,150
Goddamn it!

109
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,400
I'll kill you!

110
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,120
I wonder what took her so long to get mad.

111
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,660
Because maybe you didn't go back for more.

112
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,040
It don't seem to me that we got a choice.

113
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,840
Seeing we got no time to send for help,

114
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,960
and further seeing that our sheriff's

115
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,550
about as much use as tits on a boar.

116
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,300
Sorry I'm late. Anything happen?

117
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,430
No, no, His Honor's had the floor.

118
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,640
In case you haven't heard it yet,

119
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,100
Stacey Bridges and the Carlin brothers
are due to get out of jail today.

120
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,440
They coming here?

121
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,310
That's been their plan,
according to all reports.

122
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,110
There's no reason to believe
they've changed it.

123
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,530
Possibly they've repented their ways.

124
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,740
Preacher, they're gonna burn this
town to the ground and you know it.

125
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,740
What we're talking about now
is a way to stop them.

126
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,620
We gotta find that way now and quick.

127
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,580
Nevertheless, my conscience
will not allow me to be a party

128
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,660
to the hiring of a professional gunfighter.

129
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,040
Well, maybe you'd like to go out there
and stand them off yourself, Preacher.

130
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,960
I'm just a simple man of God.

131
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,760
Well, it's time we
unsimplified you, Reverend.

132
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,180
Now, Borders, Morris and Short
were professional gunfighters

133
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,140
on the payroll of the lago Mining Company

134
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,140
to protect our interests and
the interests of this town,

135
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,470
which are identical.

136
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,730
They stood around drinking beer and
looking snotty for a full year.

137
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,520
And then one day before we
actually needed the bastards,

138
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,770
they managed to get themselves killed.

139
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,020
So if you've got a suggestion,

140
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,480
we'd be delighted to hear it.

141
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,360
Otherwise, take your conscience elsewhere
while we think about saving your ass.

142
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,160
Land's sakes. Where's time gone to, huh?

143
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,950
Miss Peekins' eldest is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...

144
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,500
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

145
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,130
Well, we were talking
about hiring a gunfighter.

146
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,090
Yeah, we don't know anything
about that fellow there.

147
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,760
Well, we know he took the
best we could find to hire,

148
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,310
like Grant took Vicksburg.

149
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,600
Yeah, with a hidden gun in his lap.

150
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,690
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.

151
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,270
Goddamndest shooting I ever even heard of.

152
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,690
I still say we're asking for trouble!

153
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,200
A fellow like that,
what do we know about him?

154
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,360
Who is he? Where does he come from?

155
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,490
Well, you've got our
permission to go and ask him.

156
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,450
Although, the last three that tried
that didn't fare all that well.

157
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,160
Let me out!

158
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,500
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!

159
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,340
Get the hell off me! Let go of me!

160
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,630
You fat pig!

161
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,300
Hey, come here. What is this?

162
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,390
I was just down there
sounding out that stranger,

163
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,390
when she come in there
blasting away like a Cheyenne!

164
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,020
All right, Sam. All right.

165
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,560
You're planning to let him get
away with this, aren't you?

166
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,600
Be a little patient, will you? Patient?

167
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,290
Callie, when you run across a man
who's used to having his own way,

168
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,150
you let him have it until he goes too far.

169
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,610
Just what do you consider going too far?

170
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,410
I mean, isn't forcible rape in broad
daylight a misdemeanor in this town?

171
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,160
There's too much at stake to
throw away on hysterics now.

172
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,950
Hysterics?

173
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,960
Well, I can remember some hysterics
one night not too long ago.

174
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,670
Callie, keep your mouth shut!

175
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,380
Morgan, get her out of here.

176
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,840
I'll see you later.

177
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,590
Yeah.

178
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,560
Not while that squinty-eyed son of a bitch

179
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,810
is still breathing, you won't!

180
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,520
You wonder if there's
a man left in this town!

181
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,320
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!

182
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,070
Well...

183
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,280
Why not?

184
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,620
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.

185
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,250
Oh, now, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid. You...

186
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,170
Besides, I have nothing against these men.

187
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,510
Who did you say they are?

188
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,430
Well, Stacey Bridges and his
cousins, the Carlin boys,

189
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,640
they worked for the company. They...

190
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,430
You know, what you call troubleshooters.

191
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
You know, just like those
three you done in yesterday,

192
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,310
except when they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.

193
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,650
And they took care of it, too.

194
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,440
Except, well, they got too
damn big for their britches.

195
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,910
Started pushing people around, and
taking over the town and we had to...

196
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,620
Had to what?

197
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,790
Well, we had to take them
into custody, that's what.

198
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,670
Yeah. I clapped the old
bracelets on them myself.

199
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,270
Hey, you won't be wanting
that slab of pie, will you?

200
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,400
You know what happened, friend,

201
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,200
is they stole a golden ingot out
of the mining office down there,

202
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,360
and they hid it under the floorboard

203
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,530
of the shack that they lived in.

204
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,200
Kind of careless of them, wasn't it? Huh?

205
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,460
I mean, does a mining company usually
leave gold ingots lying around like that?

206
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,710
Well, it does seem
a bit peculiar, you know.

207
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,590
Matter of fact, Stacey kept bringing
that up at the trial all the time,

208
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,460
saying that he was being railroaded with.

209
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,230
And do you know that's why
they're mad at us?

210
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,140
No, I'll tell you what you
can do, Sheriff. What?

211
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,720
When those boys come back to town,

212
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,230
you just clap the bracelets right on them.

213
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,060
Me? Yeah.

214
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,100
Well, I might have forgot to mention

215
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,770
that they were all three passed
out at the time, you know?

216
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,440
Look, I'm no lawman.

217
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,700
You know, they just hung this thing on me

218
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,200
when that young Marshal Duncan was killed.

219
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,740
You know, he was whipped to death
right here in this street.

220
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,700
Bullwhipped. Damndest thing I ever saw.

221
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,670
Now, why would anybody
want to do a thing like that?

222
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,630
Well, I don't know. It wasn't
anybody from this town, anyhow.

223
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,840
How do you know?

224
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,090
Well, this is a good town,
and these are good people.

225
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,640
And look, friend, we sure would like it

226
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,680
if you'd help us with our problem.

227
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,680
Only problem you've got, Sheriff,
is a short supply of guts.

228
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,100
You people don't need me.

229
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,230
Look.

230
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,400
Place a couple of good riflemen

231
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,530
on top of that building up there.

232
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,740
Maybe a couple more with shotguns

233
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,450
down behind grain bags over there.

234
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,620
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there in the bell tower.

235
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,240
Maybe a rifleman. That should
just about take care of it.

236
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,870
Well, what would it take to
see that through, you know?

237
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,630
The ambush. What would it cost us?

238
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,050
Sheriff, I don't know if I
really like this town that much.

239
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,970
Well, this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.

240
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,050
You like them, you save them.

241
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,270
Look, what if we offered you
anything you want?

242
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,860
Anything?

243
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,070
Unlimited credit. That's what it means.

244
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,570
An open charge account with no reckoning.

245
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,740
What His Honor's trying to say is

246
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,250
you got yourself a free hand
in this town, friend.

247
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,000
Any damn thing I want, huh?

248
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,620
Yeah. Go on. Help yourself.

249
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,420
Help yourself! Go ahead. It's my pleasure.

250
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,590
Yes, sir. Anything you want that's here,

251
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,960
as best as we can get it for you, we will.

252
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,970
Even if it's some little squaw or a Mex

253
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,430
and keep your bed warm at night.

254
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,220
Hey, you!

255
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,850
Keep your sticky fingers off them
blankets if you're not buying.

256
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,980
And keep them kids under control.
Goddamn savages.

257
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,230
And besides, you know,
about handling that ambush,

258
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,070
you know, everybody in town,
more or less, is at your orders.

259
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,420
Here you go.

260
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,470
No, no. No.

261
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,300
Tell him it's all right.

262
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,680
It's all right.

263
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,350
Anything I want?

264
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,440
Now, how's that feel?

265
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,650
Not bad. I'll take them.

266
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,820
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots

267
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,530
and a tooled belt with silver buckle.

268
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,120
Let's see, that'll be, five
and two, carry the nine,

269
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,210
and that comes to exactly...

270
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,540
No charge.

271
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,390
Come on, now.

272
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,320
I'd like to get all these people a drink.

273
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,320
Yes, sir. One round for the house.
There you are.

274
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,660
This gentleman here's buying
a round for the house.

275
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,700
No fair. No fair. I ordered one, too.
Don't I get a glass of beer?

276
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,830
You get a glass of beer, right there.
Coming up.

277
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,170
There we are.

278
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,880
Now, that's one round for the house, sir.
Anything else?

279
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,220
Get yourself something.

280
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,640
Oh, thank you very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.

281
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,560
And smoke it later.

282
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,690
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.

283
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,360
There's no charge, Lutie.

284
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,480
Huh?

285
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,660
You was at the meeting. Anything
he wants in this town, he gets.

286
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,910
You voted on it.

287
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,280
I didn't know that meant free whiskey.

288
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,830
Well, everybody's got to put
something in the kitty, right?

289
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,790
Right.

290
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,760
About time this town had a new sheriff.

291
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,930
I'm the sheriff? I'm the sheriff.

292
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,520
I'm sorry, Sam.

293
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,900
But you looked so comical when
he put your badge on the runt.

294
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,820
I'm not a runt anymore. I'm the sheriff.

295
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,860
And the mayor.

296
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,450
And I'm the mayor.

297
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,110
Any objections?

298
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,700
No. No, that's fine.

299
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,540
I'm the mayor. I'm the sheriff.

300
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,750
No more, "Mordecai, bring the water.

301
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,960
"Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess."

302
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,260
Hot damn! I'm gonna declare a holiday.

303
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,720
Hot damn!

304
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,640
Wait a minute.

305
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,020
I can't be a sheriff if I don't have a gun.

306
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,020
Is this about the size gun
you're looking for?

307
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,150
No, that one. That'll do.

308
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,160
Whatever this gent wants, he's to have.

309
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,910
That's orders of Mr. Drake and Mr. Allen.

310
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,040
I want every man in the regiment
to have one of these nice rifles.

311
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,670
What regiment?

312
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,840
The City of lago Volunteers.

313
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,420
Never heard of them.

314
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,430
Why, you ought to, you're in it.

315
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,510
So are you, you, and all of you out there.

316
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,890
I want you all out in the
street in 10 minutes for drill.

317
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,120
Well, that's that.

318
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,970
Bridges, you Carlin boys,

319
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,640
don't forget your tickets
back here to my little hotel.

320
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,310
And don't worry. They ain't loaded.

321
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,190
What about our horses?

322
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,020
We had three good animals.

323
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,650
What do you think you've been
eating the last six months?

324
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,240
Damn him! Dog, I didn't eat my own horse!

325
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,960
That slop he fed us wasn't our horses.

326
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,580
He just stole them
and sold them to somebody.

327
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,710
That's what he done! Shut up.

328
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,250
Well, that's what he done! Shut up.

329
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,840
When we get to lago, you can
have the mayor's horse.

330
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,880
Fried or barbecued.

331
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,680
Well, I guess we walk some.

332
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,890
Old Drake and Allen don't
seem to have remembered.

333
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,730
Oh, they'll remember.

334
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,310
One way or another, they'll remember.

335
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,950
All right.

336
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,040
You don't wanna get shot.

337
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,880
You don't want your shops
or your houses burned.

338
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,340
You don't want your women touched.

339
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,050
You don't want anything to happen.

340
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,890
Except you're afraid
to do anything about it.

341
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,850
Or you don't know how.

342
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,860
Shit.

343
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,460
Fire! Fire!

344
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,800
Come on, fire!

345
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,710
I don't remember lending my wagons

346
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,790
to be shot up by these
goddamn fools out here.

347
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,941
You know, you're gonna look awfully silly

348
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,300
with that knife sticking up your ass.

349
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,690
Fire! Pull those triggers! Come on, shoot!

350
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,310
Shoot!

351
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,190
Aim! Fire!

352
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,450
You still here?

353
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,870
No. No, I was... I was just going.

354
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,340
Damn! Can you do that every time?

355
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,930
Damn right he can.

356
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,720
We're not gonna have a thing
in the world to worry about.

357
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,930
This is gonna be a picnic!

358
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,680
All right, keep them after us, huh?

359
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,480
Go on, out there.

360
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,290
You men carpenters?

361
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,000
Sí, señor. We do rough fixing.

362
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,920
Could you make some tables, big ones,

363
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,630
that a lot of people could sit?

364
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,920
Like for a church picnic?

365
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,040
Exactly.

366
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,470
Well, you could use sawhorses
and one-by-twelves.

367
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,550
Could you have them ready
for me by tomorrow morning?

368
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,720
If we have the lumber.

369
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,810
You'll have the lumber.

370
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,470
Come on with me.

371
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,350
You really planning a picnic?

372
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,640
Any objection?

373
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,190
No, just it's the damndest
thing I ever heard of.

374
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,230
You haven't heard the funny part.
What's that?

375
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,840
You're furnishing the beer and whiskey.

376
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,200
Oh, Preacher.

377
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,450
Good morning, Brother Belding.

378
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,250
Mrs. Lake was just asking about you.

379
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,920
Oh, how is the dear old soul?

380
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,460
Oh, she's chipper as a jaybird.

381
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,590
I don't know how she does it.

382
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,951
Well, she's got the strength
of her faith, Brother Belding.

383
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,010
Praise God. The strength of her faith.

384
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,510
Too bad about your barn. Termites?

385
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,970
There's nothing wrong with my barn.
It's sound as a dollar.

386
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,230
Then how come those two
Mexs is tearing it down?

387
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,440
What?

388
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,280
What do you greasy bastards
think you're doing to my barn?

389
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,990
Exactly what I told them.

390
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,830
We're requisitioning your barn, Belding.

391
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,000
Any objection?

392
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,840
You men can go back to work.

393
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,140
Would you mind telling me what
the hell's going on here?

394
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,140
And you can help out, too.

395
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,810
You mean, you want me to
help you tear down my barn?

396
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,020
Wait a minute.

397
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,810
Maybe he'd be better use

398
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,770
if he'd help us collect the few
little items we're still missing.

399
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,320
Items? What items? What for?

400
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,950
You got the list, Sheriff. Read it to him.

401
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,410
We still need 35 bedsheets,

402
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,620
one barbecued steer and
200 gallons of red paint.

403
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,040
Red paint?

404
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,920
We're counting on you for the bedsheets.

405
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,720
Is there anything else?

406
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,880
Yes, there is.

407
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,550
How long is it gonna take you to
get everybody out of your hotel?

408
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,310
What?

409
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,850
Everybody out. How long is it gonna take?

410
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,020
Why, I just can't...

411
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,940
I mean, I got eight people living
in rooms up there in my hotel.

412
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,650
Now, I just... Where are they gonna go?

413
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,280
Out.

414
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,710
You know better than to walk
in a man's camp and...

415
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,390
What the hell is going on?

416
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,440
Well, Stacey, looks like
we got three fresh horses.

417
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,820
Wait a while.

418
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,570
He's got him some snappy duds.

419
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,970
Faster!

420
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,890
Fire! Pull that trigger!

421
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,520
Go on!

422
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,660
Go on!

423
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,830
Shoot!

424
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:08,960
Pull that trigger!

425
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Fire!

426
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,000
Any improvement?

427
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,340
Uh, some.

428
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,371
You know, Lew and I were thinking,

429
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,590
maybe we were a little
hasty in our decision.

430
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,930
What do you mean?

431
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,890
Well, maybe we don't need any
outside help to solve our problem.

432
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,020
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't
even have a problem.

433
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,300
Every man who ever got sent up,

434
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,551
went away saying he's gonna
come back and get even, right?

435
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,690
But think about it.

436
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,310
Can you actually remember anyone ever

437
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,860
coming back and doing anything?

438
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,230
I can't think of one. Can you?

439
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,030
The point being, you want to get
rid of the gunfighter. Is that it?

440
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,320
Now, Dave, we got to before it's too late.

441
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,570
He's making a mock of this whole town.

442
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,160
Making that little dwarf the sheriff.

443
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,890
Kicking my own people out of my own hotel.

444
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,120
Got half of the women in town
sewing bedsheets together.

445
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,210
They're my bedsheets!

446
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,580
Got those Mexicans down there
building long picnic tables.

447
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,710
Lutie Naylor, down there
barbecuing a whole damn steer.

448
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,630
Some kind of a picnic.

449
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,590
Right here in our own town.

450
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,050
Sounds pretty good to me.

451
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,430
What do you mean?

452
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,140
I mean, it sounds like a good idea,

453
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,510
bringing everything out in
the open so we can see it.

454
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,560
Don't you see what we're saying?

455
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,810
This whole thing's all for nothing.

456
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,100
They're probably all three blind drunk

457
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,630
in some Nogales whorehouse right now.

458
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,270
Well, if they're dead drunk in
Nogales, we'll know in 24 hours.

459
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,770
Surely we can put up with
the man for one more day.

460
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,400
No. I say no.

461
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,740
He's got this whole town so people
are beginning to turn on each other.

462
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,080
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?

463
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,460
You want to spell that out, Drake?

464
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,540
Spell it yourself.

465
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,460
I'm not gonna jeopardize
everything I've built here

466
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,620
because some blond bitch
and he threw you out of bed.

467
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,920
God damn you! Don't talk to me that way.

468
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,090
I'll talk to you any way I like!

469
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,590
I'll say anything I have to say

470
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,800
as long as I'm running this company.

471
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,880
Well, say it, but you could listen

472
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,180
once in a while yourself, you know.

473
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,300
What's the matter, Morgan?

474
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,100
You're not getting your
fair share of the profits?

475
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,100
Profits. It's not the profits.

476
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,271
It's just that this whole
business has gone sour

477
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:52,020
since that deal with
that former Marshal Duncan.

478
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,900
Wait a minute, we had no choice
in that matter, and you know it.

479
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,110
Come on! Wait a minute...

480
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,780
The big mistake we made was hiring
that man Duncan in the first place,

481
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,780
and you did that all by yourself.
All by myself?

482
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,660
Quiet. Shut up. We can trust one another.
Guys, please...

483
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:09,790
This whole town had a
hand in what happened.

484
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,900
Hell, why do you think Stacey
Bridges and the Carlin brothers

485
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,590
kept their mouths shut all this time?

486
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,300
Same reason everybody
else did in this town.

487
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,930
One hang, we all hang.

488
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,970
Now, you just grit your teeth
a little bit longer.

489
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,480
The gunfighter stays till I say otherwise.
You understand?

490
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,530
Well, there it is, just like he said.

491
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,860
That stranger's got everybody
turning on everybody.

492
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,700
Being put out after all these years.

493
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,500
That man!

494
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,750
Right here.

495
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,670
Okay, folks, put your bags
right here in the wagon.

496
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,340
All right, folks, just put your bags

497
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,630
right here in the wagon. Right here.

498
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,090
What's going on here?

499
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,250
What the hell does it look
like is going on, Preacher?

500
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,180
They're emptying my whole hotel.

501
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,510
Throwing out paying guests,
right into the street

502
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,850
just to make room
for our new guardian angel.

503
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,480
He likes to be by himself, more or less.

504
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,310
You see who's running our town now?

505
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,320
He's sitting right over there, Mr. Belding.

506
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,610
If you don't like it

507
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,030
why don't you just go over there
and tell him that he can't?

508
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,240
Mordecai,

509
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,160
someday soon someone's going to step on
your scrawny little neck, you lizard,

510
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,370
and when they do, you're going to
be nothing but a squished monster.

511
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,960
See here,

512
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,210
you can't turn all these
people out into the night.

513
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,840
It is inhuman, brother. Inhuman!

514
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,550
I'm not your brother.

515
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,390
We are all brothers in the eyes of God.

516
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,810
All these people, are they
your sisters and brothers?

517
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,480
They most certainly are.

518
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,570
Then you won't mind if they come over

519
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,320
and stay at your place, will you?

520
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,920
All right, folks, let's go! Put
your bags up here! Let's hurry up!

521
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,500
Friends, friends, don't worry.

522
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,880
We shall find haven
for you in our own homes.

523
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,800
And it won't cost you one cent
more than regular hotel rates.

524
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,180
Paid up, that's ridiculous.

525
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,190
My room ready?

526
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,700
Two connecting rooms,
the best in the hotel.

527
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,370
One for entertaining your
many new friends in town,

528
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,240
and one for sleeping.

529
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,120
If your conscience lets you sleep.

530
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,960
Oh, I sleep just fine, ma'am.

531
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,710
Is that so?

532
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,300
You care to see for yourself?

533
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,930
You tell Mrs. Belding
there'll be two for supper.

534
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,100
I like chicken, fried.

535
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,190
And anything else?

536
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,730
Best bottle of wine in town.

537
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,660
Remember, he won't be around
forever, you little...

538
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,380
Marshal.

539
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,180
Somebody, please help me.

540
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,190
What are you doing?

541
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,071
Let go of me! You've got to stop this!
Not now!

542
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:53,110
Let go of me!

543
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,120
Damn you all to hell.

544
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,250
How did you get in here?

545
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,260
You had your chance and you missed it.

546
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,630
You're hurting me. What do you want?

547
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,890
Just a little pleasant
female company for supper.

548
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,390
You know what you are? What?

549
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:49,640
You're an animal.

550
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,890
Yeah, well, you have a way
of bringing that out.

551
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,440
No, thank you, but I don't eat with dogs.

552
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,860
You might, if it's the
dog that runs the pack.

553
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,540
Give me a half an hour to get ready.

554
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,420
You're ready right now.

555
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,130
I could be readier.

556
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,760
Half an hour.

557
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,270
You know, actually, I eat like a bird.

558
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,780
I've got it.

559
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,280
I knew that old bastard Hobart had
it in a hole under the store.

560
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,780
Look. But I've got it.

561
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,370
Yeah, all the way from France.

562
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:52,290
Yeah, would you stick a bent
knife in that, get the cork out?

563
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,960
Do you have any special
request for dessert?

564
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,840
No, I've already taken care of that.

565
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:18,900
Can't fix that without a
blacksmith or a vet. Maybe both.

566
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,650
Hell, we'll find neither one out here.

567
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,530
Well, I'll tell you something, Stace.

568
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,780
I think we've been pushing too hard.

569
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:30,490
I mean, like as not, all three of
these horses could have come up lame.

570
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,500
Hell, I feel pretty lame myself, not being
on a horse 12 months in that damn jail.

571
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,580
Back off, Cole.

572
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,670
Maybe we ought to leave you
and the horse here.

573
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,290
Well, now, Stace, I didn't mean nothing.

574
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:45,260
Hell, Stacey, he can ride double with
me until we come across somebody.

575
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,880
We'll all need fresh animals.

576
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,840
All right! Quit crying about it.

577
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:00,100
I'll tell you what, though.

578
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,440
Soon as they find those bodies back there,

579
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,150
they're gonna have
a hunting party out for us.

580
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:10,110
And I want time to take one
year of my life out of lago

581
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,570
before we move on.

582
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,410
How long is that gonna take, you figure?

583
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,540
A lifetime for some of them.

584
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,790
You're out late, Mordecai. Huh?

585
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,600
And fornication and sins of the flesh.

586
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:25,190
That's what's going on under my roof

587
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:26,980
right now while I'm talking to you.

588
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,360
That stranger has taken over
my whole hotel,

589
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,910
and thrown good, honest, decent
folk right out into the night.

590
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:36,280
Well, why didn't you stop him, Lewis?
You've got a gun.

591
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,620
You shut your fat mouth, Sam.

592
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,210
We're tired of giving you money
for doing an incompetent job!

593
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,540
Don't you talk to me that way!

594
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,170
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

595
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,250
Please! Look at us!

596
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,710
Sweet God, look what's happening to us.

597
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,710
That's right. It's just
like the preacher says.

598
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,510
That stranger's got everybody in
this town at each other's throats.

599
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,510
He's set himself up like a king!

600
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,220
He's got you all snake fascinated,
every damn one of you!

601
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,390
This crazy picnic. 200
gallons of blood-red paint.

602
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,770
It couldn't be worse if the devil
himself had ridden right into lago.

603
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,370
Welcome to lago, you son of a bitch.

604
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,920
Get out of here!

605
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,220
They're here, Father!

606
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,970
I'm sorry.

607
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:13,210
Morg!

608
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:19,050
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!

609
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,010
Morg? Morg, you better take me with you.

610
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:27,180
Morg, where are you going? Morg! Morg!

611
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,100
Don't leave me here! He'll kill me!

612
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,310
Get off my cuffs. Let's go!

613
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,870
Oh, no.

614
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,430
Oh, my beautiful hotel. They
promised me that they wouldn't...

615
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:32,160
Ruined.

616
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,000
A total loss.

617
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,170
Didn't even touch my store.

618
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:40,090
Look, I want you to watch that pilfering.

619
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,210
You know, I hold you responsible, Sheriff.

620
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,800
I'm not your goddamn sheriff. You!

621
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,720
Say, I'll need one, two... Two up there.

622
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,810
I'll need four boxes from you,

623
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,680
and shovels from you, so these
people can dig the holes.

624
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,150
Well, yes... But I thought
perhaps we could...

625
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,110
Right now.

626
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,480
Yeah. All right, everyone.

627
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,700
Was you here? I mean, did you see anything?

628
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,410
Somebody left the door open,
and the wrong dogs came home.

629
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:12,240
Yeah. Well...

630
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:15,580
Get the shovel, will you? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

631
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,720
I hope you're not gonna blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity.

632
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:29,300
Because the rest of us here
have an agreement with you.

633
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,720
Well, right now I don't feel too agreeable.

634
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:37,480
Well, maybe a little bonus will make
you a little more appreciative.

635
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,480
How little?

636
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,860
500 a head.

637
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,070
500 an ear?

638
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,320
Done. Done.

639
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,750
$3,000?

640
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,760
You promised that son of a bitch $3,000

641
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,380
after what he did to my hotel?

642
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,340
Promising's one thing. Paying's another.

643
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:12,600
He may just catch a bullet.

644
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:19,560
Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels, too.

645
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,190
I knew you were cruel, but I
didn't know how far you could go.

646
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,150
Well, you still don't.

647
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,490
Well, it doesn't matter to you.

648
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,160
I don't know where you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.

649
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,210
All the rooms are ruined
except for our room.

650
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,510
Oh...

651
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,850
Wait. Wait a minute.

652
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,890
Oh, no.

653
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,400
Oh, no. No.

654
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,900
No, let go, let go! Lewis!

655
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,150
Lewis, don't just stand there.

656
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,360
Let go of me! Let go!

657
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,660
Stop! Look, you don't need me.

658
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,990
Let go! Let go!

659
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:21,290
Let go of me!

660
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:28,870
What are you gonna do with those?

661
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,800
Defend myself.

662
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,380
Against what?

663
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:35,550
It's no secret what you
did to Callie Travers.

664
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,850
Did?

665
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,140
The other day in the stable.

666
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:44,100
As I recall, she enjoyed that quite a bit.

667
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,690
I promise you, I won't.

668
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,360
Well, you flatter yourself, lady.

669
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,400
I flatter myself?

670
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:58,290
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you, but a
man's got to get his rest sometime.

671
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,370
Oblige me?

672
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,500
But I'll tell you what. If you
come back in about a half-hour,

673
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,210
I'll see what I can do, all right?

674
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,470
Why, you low-down, stinking, son of a...

675
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,870
Have you ever heard the name Jim Duncan?

676
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,040
I've heard a lot of things. Why?

677
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,670
He was town marshal here.

678
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,090
He's lying out there in an unmarked grave.

679
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:59,510
They say the dead don't rest
without a marker of some kind.

680
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,060
Do you believe that?

681
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,440
What makes you think I care?

682
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,650
I don't know.

683
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:11,860
He's the reason this town's
afraid of strangers.

684
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,740
I was going to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.

685
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,410
What's funny?

686
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,540
You ask me that in a blown-up hotel

687
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,160
with seven dead men to your credit already?

688
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:30,630
I was just stopping by
for a bottle of whiskey

689
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,380
and a nice hot bath.

690
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,880
All right. If you say so.

691
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,100
You don't believe me?

692
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,140
Mister, whatever you say is fine with me.

693
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,320
Be careful.

694
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,910
You're a man who makes people
afraid, and that's dangerous.

695
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,660
Well, it's what people know
about themselves inside

696
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,670
that makes them afraid.

697
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,970
I don't know if we shouldn't
mark the grave somehow.

698
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,220
Sam?

699
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:29,020
I don't see any need.

700
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,310
Ain't likely that anybody's
gonna cry over them anyhow.

701
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,370
You know what to do.

702
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,670
Yes, sir, Captain.

703
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,750
All right!

704
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,670
Everybody grab a brush and start in.

705
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,640
You mean, you want the whole place painted?

706
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:06,140
Everything.

707
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,980
You can't possibly mean the church, too.

708
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,850
I mean especially the church.

709
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:16,020
All right, I'll paint
if you say we've got to,

710
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:19,650
but when we get done, this
place is gonna look like hell.

711
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:49,350
Hello, Lewis.

712
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,740
I want you to go to that meeting
with me, Sarah. It's very important.

713
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:08,870
No.

714
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,080
Not now, not ever.

715
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,250
They are still your neighbors!

716
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,550
Yes, they're my neighbors,
and they make me sick.

717
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,380
Hiding behind words like
"faith," "peace," and "trust."

718
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,510
Good words. Damn good words.

719
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,850
But we hid a murder behind them.

720
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:28,970
Won't you never understand, woman?

721
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,020
It wasn't anything we wanted to do.

722
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,810
When Duncan found out the mine
was on government property,

723
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,850
it was just a technicality, really,

724
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,810
but he was determined to turn us in.

725
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,940
Wouldn't listen to reason.

726
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,070
Is that why? Is that
really why it happened?

727
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:48,410
Don't you see, Sarah? They would
have closed down the mine!

728
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,450
Do you know what would've
happened to this town then?

729
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,080
It would've been the end of
everything that we've worked on.

730
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,210
All of it, all of us! And you, too, wife.

731
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:04,170
Now, sometimes we have to
do what's necessary to do,

732
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,180
for the good of everybody.

733
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,840
That's the price of progress.

734
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:10,890
And what's the price
of a human life, Lewis?

735
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,020
Ask your good friends if they know that.

736
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,190
Uh-huh.

737
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:18,100
Your damn conscience.

738
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:22,730
I'll say, it's sure taken a
hell of a while to bother you.

739
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:27,950
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.

740
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,050
That's Morg Allen, or what's left of him.

741
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:30,720
Well, now, what's he doing,
riding around here like that?

742
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,720
He's come back to pay us back for some
jail time that was rightfully his.

743
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,720
Only he don't know it yet.

744
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,540
Stacey, help me.

745
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,620
My arm. Help me.

746
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,510
Help me, Stacey.

747
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,300
I'm curious, Morg.

748
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,640
You helped them railroad us,

749
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,140
and you've got the balls to come
down here and ask us for a favor?

750
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,480
Goddamn if I don't admire you.

751
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:25,190
Do something about my arm, Stacey.

752
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,780
Well, I am doing something, Morg.

753
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:30,650
Sitting here watching you bleed to death.

754
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,580
Stacey, things have changed in lago.

755
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,540
You need me.

756
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,960
I gotta tell you about it.

757
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,010
Yeah. From the looks of your arm, Morg,

758
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:52,430
it looks like you've run your
welcome out in lago, and ours, too.

759
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:54,840
What me and the boys want to know

760
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:57,350
is how we're gonna
pick up 12 months' back pay

761
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:58,791
and everything else that's owed us.

762
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:00,350
Stacey, for God's sakes!

763
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:02,270
No, no. For our sake.

764
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,260
Now you can help us, all right,

765
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,470
and you can help yourself, too.

766
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,980
Now you just give me the
combination to that big iron box

767
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,401
in the back of your office,

768
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,400
and me and the boys will just

769
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:14,860
sneak right in there

770
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,990
real quiet-like, take what's
ours, bring you the rest,

771
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,910
or leave it there safe and
sound, that's up to you.

772
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,540
First, of course, we'll fix up your arm,

773
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,920
set you over there in the shade

774
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,340
with a nice canteen full of water.

775
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:32,800
You no-good, worthless son of a bitch.

776
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,300
You're probably right about that.

777
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:41,180
Give me that combination, Morg.

778
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:44,730
I wouldn't give you the
combination to the gates of hell.

779
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,450
Ugh! Dog!

780
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:58,700
Sure had a lot of blood
left in him, didn't he?

781
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,170
Two sticks of dynamite will take
care of that iron box, anyway.

782
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,960
We don't need him.

783
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:31,150
Dan, you hit?

784
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:32,280
I don't know.

785
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,400
I don't think so.

786
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,860
Damn near tore my leg off!

787
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,830
Who the hell is that?

788
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,790
Must be Dave Drake.

789
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,380
What the hell did you hit?

790
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,770
Keep shooting, damn it!

791
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,360
He shot my ear off!

792
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,650
Somebody up there's playing games.

793
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,360
He shot my ear off!

794
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:24,240
Well, he could've shot your whole
damn head off! Now get down!

795
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,210
Dave, is that you?

796
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,260
Come on out! We'll settle this.

797
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:49,230
Morg was almost dead, anyway,
from that arm!

798
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,810
I just put him out of his misery!

799
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,580
I'll kill you!

800
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:16,420
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

801
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,090
Come down out of there, you bastard!
I'll cut your heart out!

802
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:25,350
Let's go up there, Stacey. There
might be some more dynamite.

803
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:28,730
I'll get him. I'll get him,
whoever it was up there.

804
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,890
I'll kill every man in lago!

805
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:16,291
The guests are on their way to the party,

806
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,770
so gather all the people together.

807
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:21,030
Right, Captain! All right,
men, get that sign up!

808
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,290
Come on! They're coming!

809
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:46,090
All right, everybody, come on!
Get a little move on!

810
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:58,860
I want you up in that tower.

811
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,820
First sign of dust, you
ring the bell, you hear?

812
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,900
Are you sure this is gonna be all right?

813
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,950
It's gonna be all right.

814
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:12,120
He's back! He's here.
It's time to get ready.

815
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:18,420
What's the matter with everybody?
Wait till we gun them down.

816
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,420
Bang, bang, bang!

817
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:25,760
All right, everybody, I think
we're expected outside.

818
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,850
I just hope that shooter we
hired is feeling up to snuff.

819
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:31,010
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

820
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,860
Let's go.

821
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,910
Hey, señor, can we come to the fiesta?

822
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,120
No.

823
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:41,080
I want everybody to have plenty of those.

824
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:58,350
Hey, ain't it about time
we got out there, huh?

825
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:02,610
There's plenty of time.

826
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:04,860
Yeah, but they'll be here any damn minute.

827
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,070
I think Sam's right. We ought to.

828
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:08,240
Yeah.

829
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,280
What about after?

830
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,700
What about after we do it?

831
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:14,780
Hmm?

832
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,620
What do we do then?

833
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:20,210
Then you live with it.

834
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:37,310
Where you gonna be? Are you
gonna take the first shot?

835
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,480
Are you gonna get Stacey Bridges first?

836
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,650
Or maybe you're gonna get
all three by yourself?

837
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,450
When are you gonna give the signal?

838
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:55,830
I'm not. You are.

839
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,840
You old people, move out of here!

840
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,110
Here they come!

841
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:37,900
Yee-haw!

842
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:44,870
Come on!

843
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:46,500
Fire!

844
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,170
Fire! Fire!

845
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:22,780
Get them.

846
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,000
Don't shoot me. Don't! Don't.

847
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,800
A party? A party?

848
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,520
Welcome home party, huh?

849
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,780
Well, here's to your party.

850
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,370
Give me another bottle.

851
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:56,580
Give me another bottle!

852
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,140
Well, now the party's over.

853
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,480
- Stace!
- Let go of me!

854
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,810
Look what I found in the bushes.

855
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,110
Look what I found in the bushes!

856
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,570
Stacey, it was always you.

857
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:30,240
That's why Morg Allen hated you.

858
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,750
He knew how much I loved you.

859
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,170
Yeah, I bet you just cried
yourself to sleep every night

860
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:43,760
thinking about me
in that territorial prison.

861
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:48,720
But I did. I really did!

862
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:51,430
Yeah, well, I can see it all now.

863
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:57,270
You lying there in Morg Allen's
bed, just a-crying and a-humping.

864
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:59,770
Oh, no, no!

865
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:01,940
Give me that bottle.

866
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:09,110
Cole, go and get the horses ready.

867
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,950
You got it, Stace.

868
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,830
Stacey. Stacey, you're gonna
take me with you, aren't you?

869
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:21,130
I can do better than you
in a four-bit fancy house.

870
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,670
You still here?

871
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,430
God damn right I'm still here.

872
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:31,050
I wanna know who them sons of
bitches was that ambushed us.

873
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:33,350
That's what I'd like to know.

874
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:37,310
That's what we're gonna find out right now.

875
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,820
Who are you?

876
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,500
Don't hit me.

877
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:09,260
Don't hit me, please!

878
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,430
Please, don't hit me.

879
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:14,510
Please, stop!

880
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,650
Please, don't hit me! Please!

881
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,210
Come on, Stacey. Let's get out of here.
Shut up.

882
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:54,760
Okay, everybody out.

883
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,100
Everybody out!

884
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:58,680
Out!

885
01:36:58,770 --> 01:36:59,770
Come on, move!

886
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:01,390
Go on. Get out!

887
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:03,850
Move!

888
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:09,900
Go on.

889
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,780
Move!

890
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:16,990
Hurry up in there. Move!

891
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:19,700
Move!

892
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,210
Hold up there! Get in there!
Hold it right there!

893
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:43,690
- Dynamite!
- Dynamite!

894
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:09,630
Stacey, the goddamn horses are gone.

895
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:14,590
Go on. Go on!

896
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:53,520
Help me.

897
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,530
Help me.

898
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,370
Who are you?

899
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:04,970
Who are you?

900
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:24,730
I'm just about done here.

901
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:29,490
I never did know your name.

902
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:32,240
Yes, you do.

903
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:36,290
Take care.

904
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,330
Yes, sir, Captain.
