1
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,208
Jack! Hey!
Let's go, buster! Move!

2
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Beer.

3
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,375
And a bottle.

4
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,542
Ain't much good.

5
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,083
It's all there is.

6
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,542
Uh, will you want anything else?

7
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,625
Just a peaceful hour
to drink it in.

8
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,833
Flea-bitten range bums
don't usually stop in iago.

9
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,500
Life here's a little
too quick for 'em.

10
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,792
Maybe you think you're fast
enough to keep up with us, huh?

11
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,167
A lot faster than
you'll ever live to be.

12
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,042
Yes, sir?

13
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,292
- A shave and a hot bath?
- That'll be 90 cents.

14
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,083
Uh, cash.

15
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, what I mean to say is that
the 90 cents usually comes first.

16
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,458
But, uh, hell,
it don't really matter.

17
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,750
Before or after.
What's the diff?

18
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,292
Yes, sir.

19
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,542
Yes.

20
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,875
There you are.

21
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,042
0h, um, eau de lilac's
only 10 cents more.

22
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,792
Lilac water.
Oh, the ladies love it.

23
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,208
Shall we make it
an even dollar? Hmm? No.

24
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:37,833
All right.

25
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,250
Hmm. Yes.

26
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,208
Yes, uh...

27
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,500
Holy Moses.

28
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,583
Right you are, gentlemen.

29
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,417
Be right with you.
Just... just have a chair.

30
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,708
You don't like our company?

31
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,792
What's the matter with you?

32
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,458
I'm speakin' to you, pig shit.

33
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,583
I think he's got some of
that pig shit in his ear.

34
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,250
I don't know which smells worse,
him or the shit in the bottle.

35
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, dear! 0h!

36
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,292
What did you say
your name was again?

37
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,750
I didn't.

38
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,875
No. I guess you didn't
at that, did you?

39
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,853
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

40
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,958
Look at this. It's ruined.

41
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,125
There's no need for all that.

42
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,167
All what?

43
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,823
If you want to get acquainted,
why don't you just say so?

44
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,708
Acquainted? Why, you'd be amusing
if you weren't so pathetic.

45
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,500
Just a minute.

46
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,417
I'm not finished with you yet.

47
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,497
You know, at a distance,
you'd almost pass for a man.

48
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,000
But you're certainly a disappointment
up close, aren't you?

49
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,333
To your feet, ma'am.
They're almost as big as your mouth.

50
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,958
- You know what you are?
- Mmm?

51
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,792
Just trash.

52
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,250
A bottle of whiskey for courage
and the manners of a goat.

53
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,753
You're the one who could
use a lesson in manners.

54
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,292
Not from you, whiskey breath.

55
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,625
Let go of me.

56
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,875
Let go!

57
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,375
Let go of me! No!

58
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,917
Let go of me, you! Put me down!

59
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,875
What are you doing?

60
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,667
You...

61
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,125
Wh... what are you doing?

62
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,750
What are you doing?

63
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,917
My horse.

64
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:48,958
A room.

65
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,375
Would you like to register,
please... s-sir?

66
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,167
Somebody please... help me.

67
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,333
Damn you all to hell.

68
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,500
- Good morning. Sleep well?
- Yeah.

69
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,833
Say, uh, are you
planning to stay...

70
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,833
I mean, keep your room
another night?

71
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,083
I'll let you know.

72
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,875
All right. Anything you say.

73
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,625
Mornin'.

74
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,160
I've still got a bath coming.

75
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,583
Nice hot bath comin' right up. Yes, sir.

76
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:27,250
Uh, m-mordecai, you put
some more hot water in that tub there.

77
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,375
This... this gentleman
wants a bath.

78
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:34,167
Y-You can hang your clothes right
down there on the... on the... on the peg.

79
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,833
Now, miss p's does a nice...
Oh, I'm sorry.

80
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,208
Right this way, captain, sir.

81
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,018
Unless'n you want mordecai to take 'em out

82
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:41,684
and get 'em laundered
while you're soakin'.

83
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,125
Miss peekins does
a right clean boiled wash.

84
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,875
Uses lye for pants rabbits,
she does. No itch, no scratch.

85
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:59,083
Well, pour the water,
mordecai, before it gets cold.

86
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,875
We want the gentleman
to be comfortable.

87
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:24,083
Well, I, uh, been
wantin' to talk to you.

88
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,875
Yeah, I might as well
get this stool here

89
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,542
and set right down
and do it, huh?

90
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,042
If that's all right
with you, huh?

91
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:50,583
Uh, well, what's it about
is Billy borders.

92
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,625
Don't know the man.

93
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,333
Well, you missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.

94
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:03,125
Him and ike sharp
and Fred Morris.

95
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:10,667
You know, uh, those are just the
names in case you're interested.

96
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,167
Well, I'm not really
interested, sheriff.

97
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,542
Well, I can't say
I blame you, you know.

98
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,042
Billy, he wasn't
a loved man, you know.

99
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,958
And he didn't have
much personality.

100
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,125
What he did have was
all bad, just bad.

101
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,458
What you're tryin' to say is
there's no charge, right?

102
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,792
Well, forgive and forget,
you know.

103
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,708
That's, uh, our motto.

104
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,792
You dirty bastard.

105
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,750
I'll kill you!

106
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,542
Damn it, Callie! Goddamn!

107
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:57,875
Goddamn it!

108
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,250
Let go of me, you fat slug!

109
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,458
Stop... ouch!

110
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:04,167
Look, tell him
I'd appreciate it...

111
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:08,375
If he doesn't leave town
until I talk to him!

112
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,333
Goddamn it!

113
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,083
I'll kill you!

114
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:22,042
Wonder what took her
so long to get mad.

115
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,500
Because maybe you didn't
go back for more.

116
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,125
It don't seem to me
that we got a choice,

117
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:33,167
seein' we got no time
to send for help,

118
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,917
and further seein' that our sheriff's
about as much use as tits on a boar.

119
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,333
Sorry I'm late. Anything happen?

120
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,667
No, no, his honor's
had the floor.

121
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:43,976
In case you haven't
heard it yet,

122
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,250
Stacey Bridges and the carlin
brothers are due to get out of jail today.

123
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:48,792
They comin' here?

124
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,726
That's been their plan,
according to all reports.

125
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,559
There's no reason to believe
they've changed it.

126
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,875
Possibly they've
repented their ways.

127
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:58,292
Preacher, they're gonna burn this
town to the ground and you know it.

128
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,042
What we're talking about
now is a way to stop them.

129
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:03,583
We've gotta find that
way now and quick.

130
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:07,042
Well, nevertheless, my conscience
will not allow me to be a party

131
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,083
to the hiring of
a professional gunfighter.

132
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,375
Well, maybe you'd like to go out there
and stand them off yourself, preacher.

133
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,417
I'm just a simple man of god.

134
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,125
Well, it's time we unsimplified you,
reverend.

135
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:20,708
Now borders, Morris and short
were professional gunfighters

136
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,583
on the payroll of
the iago mining company

137
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,375
to protect our interests
and the interests of this town,

138
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,708
which are identical.

139
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:30,000
They stood around drinking beer
and looking snotty for a full year.

140
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,226
Then one day before we
actually needed the bastards,

141
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,958
they managed
to get themselves killed.

142
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,833
So if you've got a suggestion,
we'd be delighted to hear it.

143
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,833
Otherwise,
take your conscience elsewhere

144
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,750
while we think about
saving your ass.

145
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,667
Land sakes.
Where's time gone to?

146
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,708
Miss peekins' eldest
is feeling poorly.

147
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,333
I promised I'd...

148
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,500
If you gentlemen excuse me.

149
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,250
Well, we were talkin'
about hirin' a gunfighter.

150
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,518
We don't know anything
about that fella there.

151
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:07,625
We know he took the best we could
find to hire like Grant took vicksburg.

152
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:09,917
Yeah, with a hidden gun
in his lap.

153
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,000
Three for three.

154
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,000
One right between the eyes.

155
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,500
Goddamnedest shooting
I ever even heard of.

156
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:19,125
I still say
we're asking for trouble.

157
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,680
Fella like that,
what do we know about him?

158
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,893
Who is he?
Where does he come from?

159
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,877
Well, you've got our permission
to go and ask him.

160
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,042
Although the last three that
tried that didn't fare all that well.

161
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,417
Let me out!

162
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:37,083
Damn you! Let go of me,
you fat slug!

163
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,625
Get your hands off me!
Let go of me!

164
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:40,875
You bastard!

165
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,625
Hey, come here. What is this?

166
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,875
I was just down there
soundin' out that stranger,

167
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,762
when she come in there
blastin' away like...

168
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,542
All right, all right, Sam.
All right.

169
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,893
Planning to let him get away with this,
aren't you?

170
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:55,167
- Be a little patient, will ya?
- Patient?

171
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,726
Callie, when you run across a man
who's used to having his own way,

172
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,750
you let him have it
until he goes too far.

173
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,583
Just what do you
consider goin' too far?

174
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,250
I mean, isn't forcible rape
in broad daylight

175
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:07,750
a misdemeanor in this town?

176
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,208
There's too much at stake
to throw away on hysterics now.

177
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,250
Hysterics?

178
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,750
Well, I can remember
some hysterics

179
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,333
one night not too long ago.

180
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,208
Callie, keep your mouth shut!

181
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,250
Morgan, get her out of here.

182
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,000
I'll see you later.

183
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,750
Not while that squinty-eyed son of
a bitch is still breathing, you won't!

184
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,792
You wonder if there's
a man left in this town!

185
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,667
I mean, one honest-to-god man
with a full set of balls!

186
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:46,500
Well, uh...

187
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,500
Why not?

188
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,208
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.

189
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,000
Well, now.

190
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,375
Don't get fact
mixed up with stupid.

191
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,375
You... you, uh...

192
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,542
Besides, I have nothing
against these men.

193
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:03,958
Who'd you say they are?

194
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,750
Well, Stacey Bridges and his cousins,
the carlin boys.

195
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,101
They... they worked
for the company.

196
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,625
They were, you know,
what you call troubleshooters.

197
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:17,875
You know, just like those
three you done in yesterday,

198
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:20,583
except when they was here before
there was lots of trouble.

199
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,583
And they took care of it too,
except...

200
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:25,458
Well, they got too damn big
for their britches.

201
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:29,542
Started pushin' people around and
takin' over the town, and we had to...

202
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,417
Had to what?

203
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,875
Well, we had to take 'em
into custody, that's what.

204
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,375
You know?

205
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,958
I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.

206
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:56,292
Hey, you won't be wantin'
that slab of pie, will ya?

207
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,958
You know what happened, friend,

208
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:08,500
is they stole a golden ingot out
of the mining office down there

209
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,625
and they hid it under the floorboard
of the shack that they lived in.

210
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,917
- Kind of careless of 'em, wasn't it?
- Huh?

211
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,417
I mean, does a mining company usually
leave gold ingots iyin' around like that?

212
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,917
Well, that does seem
a little peculiar, you know.

213
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,768
Matter of fact, Stacey kept bringing
that up at the trial all the time,

214
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,875
saying that he was
being railroaded.

215
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:30,292
Yeah. And do you know,
that's why they're mad at us.

216
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,625
Now, I'll tell you
what you can do, sheriff.

217
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,208
- What?
- When those boys

218
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,875
- come back to town...
- Uh-huh?

219
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,333
You just clap
the bracelets right on 'em.

220
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,750
Well, I might have
forgot to mention,

221
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:45,667
they were all three
passed out at the time, you know?

222
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,042
Look, I'm no lawman.

223
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,792
They just hung this thing on me

224
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,083
when that young marshal,
Duncan, was killed.

225
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,875
You know, he was whipped to death
right here in this street.

226
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:58,458
Bull-whipped.
Damnedest thing I ever saw.

227
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,750
Now, why would anybody want
to do a thing like that?

228
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:06,542
Well, I don't know. It wasn't
anybody from this town anyhow.

229
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:07,833
How do you know?

230
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:11,125
Well, this is a good town,
and these are good people.

231
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,875
And look, friend,
we sure would like it

232
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,875
if you'd help us
with our problem.

233
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:18,833
Only problem you've got,
sheriff,

234
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,583
is a short supply of guts.

235
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,458
You people don't need me.

236
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,458
Look.

237
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:29,125
Place a couple good riflemen
on top of that building up there.

238
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:33,458
Maybe a couple more with shotguns
down behind grain bags over there.

239
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,875
A few more on this roof here.

240
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,580
Lookout up there in the
bell tower. Maybe a rifleman.

241
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,228
That should just about
take care of it.

242
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,542
Well, what would it take
to see that through, you know?

243
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:45,333
- Hmm?
- The ambush. What would it cost us?

244
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:49,208
Sheriff, I don't know as if I
really like this town that much.

245
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,292
Well, this is
a god-fearin' town.

246
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,042
These are god-fearin' people.

247
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,583
You like 'em, you save 'em.

248
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,458
Look, what if we offered
you anything you want?

249
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:08,875
Anything?

250
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,000
Unlimited credit.
That's what it means.

251
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,750
An open charge account
with no reckonin'.

252
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:18,792
Uh, wh-what his honor's
trying to say is...

253
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,208
You got yourself
a free hand in this town, friend.

254
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,667
- Any damn thing I want, huh?
- Yeah. Go on. Help yourself.

255
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,542
Help yourself! Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.

256
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,417
Yes, sir, anything
you want that's here,

257
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,792
as best as we can get it for you,
we will.

258
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:36,958
Even if it's some
little squaw or a mex

259
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,917
to keep your bed warm at night.

260
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,000
Hey, you!

261
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,018
Keep your sticky fingers off
them blankets if you're not buyin'.

262
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,417
And keep them kids
under control.

263
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,000
Goddamn savages.

264
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:50,375
A-And besides, you know,
about handlin' that ambush, you know,

265
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:53,958
everybody in town,
more or less, is at your orders.

266
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,375
Here you go.

267
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,833
No, no. No.

268
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:20,917
Tell him it's all right, hmm?

269
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:23,375
It's all right.

270
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,333
Anything I want, hmm?

271
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,000
Now, how's that feel?

272
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,375
Not bad. I'll take 'em.

273
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:21,667
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots

274
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,375
and a tooled belt
with silver buckle.

275
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:28,333
Let's see, that'll be...
Five and two, carry the nine...

276
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:31,375
That comes to exactly...

277
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,958
No charge.

278
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,667
C-Come on now.

279
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,167
I'd like to get all
these people a drink.

280
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,083
Yes, sir.
One round for the house.

281
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,375
There you are.

282
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:45,167
This gentleman here is
buying a round for the house.

283
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,542
No fair, no fair. I ordered one too.
Don't I get a glass of beer?

284
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,125
You get a glass of beer
right there. Coming up.

285
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,875
There we are.

286
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:01,583
Now, that's one round
for the house, sir.

287
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,125
- Anything else?
- Get yourself something.

288
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,833
Oh, thank you very kindly, sir.

289
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,542
I'll have a cigar.

290
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,667
And, uh, smoke it later.

291
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:17,667
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.

292
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:20,542
There's no charge, lutie.

293
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,125
- Huh?
- You was at the meeting.

294
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:25,542
Anything he wants
in this town, he gets.

295
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,625
- You voted on it.
- I didn't know that meant free whiskey.

296
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:32,583
Well, everybody's got to put
somethin' in the kitty. Right?

297
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,708
Right.

298
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:44,000
About time this town
had a new sheriff.

299
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,042
I'm the sheriff?

300
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,500
I'm the sheriff!

301
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,000
I-I'm sorry, Sam.

302
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:57,750
But you looked so comical when
he put your badge on the runt.

303
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:00,958
I'm not a runt anymore.
I'm the sheriff.

304
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,792
- And the mayor.
- And I'm the mayor.

305
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,417
Any objections?

306
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:08,750
No. No, that's fine.

307
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,542
I-I'm the mayor.

308
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,667
I'm the sheriff.

309
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:18,458
No more,
"mordecai, bring the water.

310
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,667
Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess."

311
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,125
Hot damn! I'm gonna
declare a holiday.

312
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:26,875
Hot damn!

313
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,083
Wait a minute.

314
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,458
I can't be a sheriff
if I don't have a gun.

315
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,417
Is this about the size gun
you're lookin' for?

316
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,917
No, that one. That'll do.

317
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,833
Whatever this gent wants,
he's to have.

318
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,417
Yes, orders of Mr. Drake
and Mr. Allen.

319
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,583
I want every man in the regiment
to have one of these nice rifles.

320
00:38:58,917 --> 00:38:59,917
What regiment?

321
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:05,042
The city of iago volunteers.

322
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,917
Never heard of 'em.

323
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:08,875
Well, you ought to.
You're in it.

324
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,167
So are you, you
and all of you out there.

325
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,125
I want you all out in the street
in 10 minutes for drill.

326
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,292
Well, that's that.

327
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:50,792
Bridges, you carlin boys,

328
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,583
don't forget your
tickets back here

329
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,917
to my little hotel.

330
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,417
Don't worry. They ain't loaded.

331
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,458
What about our horses?

332
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,083
We had three good animals.

333
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,198
What do you think you've
been eatin' the last six months?

334
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,958
Damn him.

335
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:18,125
Dogged, I didn't eat
my own horse!

336
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,667
That slop he fed us
wasn't our horses.

337
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,351
He just stole 'em and sold 'em
to somebody. That's what he done.

338
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,375
Shut up.

339
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:25,062
- Well, that's what he done!
- Shut up!

340
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,458
When we get to iago,
you can have the mayor's horse.

341
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,083
Fried or barbecued.

342
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:35,167
Well, I guess we walk some.

343
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,418
Old Drake and Allen don't
seem to have remembered.

344
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,958
Oh, they'll remember.

345
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,417
One way or another,
they'll remember.

346
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,792
All right.

347
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,125
You don't want to get shot.

348
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,250
You don't want your shops
or houses burned.

349
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,862
You don't want
your women touched.

350
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,320
You don't want
anything to happen.

351
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,500
Except you're afraid
to do anything about it.

352
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,792
Or you don't know how.

353
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,583
Hyah!

354
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,500
Hyah!

355
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,083
Hyah!

356
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:32,042
Fire! Fire!

357
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:52,333
Fire!

358
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,333
Shit.

359
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,500
Fire!

360
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Fire! Fire!

361
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:18,917
Hyah! Move it!

362
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,333
Hyah! Come on!

363
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,750
Fire!

364
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,458
Hyah!

365
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,208
Hyah!

366
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,333
Fire!

367
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:53,542
I don't remember lending my wagons to be
shot up by those goddamn fools out here.

368
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,000
You know, you're gonna look awfully silly
with that knife sticking up your ass.

369
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,125
Hyah!

370
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:08,833
Fire! Pull those triggers!

371
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,958
Come on, shoot! Shoot!

372
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:13,833
Bang! Fire!

373
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:21,792
You still here?

374
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,833
Uh, no.

375
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,583
No, I was, uh...
I was just goin'.

376
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,083
Whoa!

377
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:36,667
Whoa.

378
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,792
Damn! Can you
do that every time?

379
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,375
Damn right he can.

380
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:48,125
We're not gonna have a thing in the world
to worry about. This is gonna be a picnic!

381
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,292
All right,
keep 'em after it, huh?

382
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:54,958
Hyah! Giddap! Hyah!

383
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,250
You men carpenters?

384
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,292
Si, sefior. We do rough fixing.

385
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,750
Could you make some tables,
big ones, that a lot of people could sit?

386
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,333
- Like for a church picnic?
- Exactly.

387
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:22,958
Well, you could use sawhorses
and one-by-twelves.

388
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,913
Could you have them ready
for me by tomorrow morning?

389
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:28,250
- If we have the lumber.
- You'll have the lumber.

390
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:30,333
- Come on with me.
- Vémonos.

391
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:33,958
- You really plannin' a picnic?
- Any objection?

392
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,583
No, just,
it's the damnedest thing I ever heard of.

393
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,601
- You haven't heard the funny part.
- What's that?

394
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,417
You're furnishing
the beer and whiskey.

395
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,792
- Oh, preacher.
- Good morning, brother belding.

396
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,583
Mrs. Lake was just
asking about you.

397
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,250
Oh, how is the dear old soul?

398
00:45:57,417 --> 00:46:00,125
She's chipper as a jaybird.
I don't know how she does it.

399
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,518
Well, she's got the strength
of her faith, brother belding.

400
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,208
Praise god.
The strength of her faith.

401
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,625
Too bad about your barn.
Termites?

402
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,583
There's nothing wrong with
my barn. It's sound as a dollar.

403
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,375
Then how come those
two mexs is tearin' it down?

404
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:28,625
What the f... you greasy bastards
think you're doing to my barn?

405
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:31,125
Exactly what I told 'em.

406
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,083
We're requisitioning
your barn, belding.

407
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:36,875
Any objection?

408
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,458
You men can go back to work.

409
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,417
Would you mind tellin' me
what the hell's goin' on here?

410
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,250
And you can help out too.

411
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,875
You mean, you want me
to help you tear down my barn?

412
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,083
Wait a minute.

413
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,042
Maybe he'd be better use
if he'd help us collect

414
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:03,000
a few little items
we're still missing.

415
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:05,708
I-Items? What items? What for?

416
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,750
You got the list, sheriff.
Read it to him.

417
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,292
We still need 35 bedsheets,

418
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,417
one barbecued steer...

419
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,958
And 200 gallons of red paint.

420
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,167
Red paint?

421
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,542
We're counting on you
for the bedsheets.

422
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,792
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, there is.

423
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,875
How long's it gonna take to get
everybody out of your hotel?

424
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,875
Everybody out.
How long is it gonna take?

425
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:39,458
Why, I just can't...

426
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,208
I mean, I got eight people living
in rooms up there in my hotel.

427
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,542
Now, I just...
Where they gonna go?

428
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,835
You know better'n to walk
into a man's camp and...

429
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:10,917
What the hell is goin' on?

430
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:04,083
Well, Stacey, it looks like
we got three fresh horses.

431
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,083
Wait a while.

432
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:11,667
He's got him some snappy duds.

433
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,625
Faster! Fire!

434
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,125
Fire! Pull that trigger!

435
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,500
Fire! Fire! Hey!

436
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,292
Pull that trigger! Fire!

437
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,125
Any improvement?

438
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,833
Some.

439
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,042
Lew and I were just thinking maybe
we were a little hasty in our decision.

440
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,875
What do you mean?

441
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,792
Well, maybe we don't need
any outside help to solve our problem.

442
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:22,798
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't
even have a problem.

443
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,393
Every man that ever got sent up

444
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:26,684
went away saying he's gonna come back
and get even, right?

445
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:27,708
Well, think about it.

446
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:30,667
Can you actually remember anyone
ever comin' back and doin' anything?

447
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:32,158
I can't think of one. Can you?

448
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,375
The point being, you want to
get rid of the gunfighter. Is that it?

449
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,417
Dave, we've gotta,
before it's too late.

450
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,208
He's making a mock
of this whole town.

451
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:42,167
Making that little dwarf
the sheriff?

452
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,973
Kickin' my own people
out of my own hotel?

453
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,934
Got half of the women in town sewing
bedsheets together.

454
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:46,958
They're my bedsheets!

455
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,542
Got those Mexicans down there
building long picnic tables.

456
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,917
Lutie naylor down there barbecuin' a whole
damn steer. Some kind of a picnic.

457
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:55,667
Right here in our own town.

458
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,083
- Sounds pretty good to me.
- What do you mean?

459
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,083
I mean it sounds like a good idea,

460
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,410
bringin' everything out into the open
so we can see it.

461
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,851
Don't you see what we're sayin'?
This whole thing's all for nothin'.

462
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:07,684
They're probably all three blind drunk
in some Nogales whorehouse right now.

463
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:10,250
Well, if they're dead drunk in Nogales,
we'll know in 24 hours.

464
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:12,542
Surely we can put up
with the man for one day.

465
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:15,375
No. I say no.
He's got this whole town

466
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,342
so people are beginnin'
to turn on each other.

467
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,708
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?

468
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,485
- Do you want to spell that out, Drake?
- Spell it yourself.

469
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:30,434
I'm not gonna jeopardize
everything I've built here

470
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,393
because some blond bitch
in heat threw you out of bed.

471
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:35,434
- God damn you! Don't talk to me that way.
- I'll talk to you any way I like!

472
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,851
I'll say anything I have to say as
long as I'm running this company.

473
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,934
Well, say it! But you could
listen once in a while yourself, you know.

474
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:43,167
What's the matter, Morgan? You not
gettin' your fair share of the profits?

475
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,000
The profits?
It's not the profits.

476
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,184
It's just that this whole
business has gone sour

477
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:49,792
since that deal with
that former marshal, Duncan.

478
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:52,917
Wait a minute. We had no choice
in that matter, and you know it.

479
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,434
- Aw, come on!
- Wait a minute, fellas...

480
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:57,018
The big mistake we made was hiring
that man, Duncan, in the first place,

481
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:58,351
and you did that all by yourself.

482
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:00,250
- All right now...
- Quiet. Shut up.

483
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,542
We can trust one another.

484
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,333
This whole town had...

485
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:08,000
Had a hand in what happened.

486
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:12,875
Hell, why do you think Stacey Bridges
and the carlin brothers

487
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,667
kept their mouths shut
all this time?

488
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,708
Same reason everybody else
did in this town.

489
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:20,750
One hang, we all hang.

490
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:26,625
Now, you just grit your teeth
a little bit longer.

491
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,750
The gunfighter stays till I say
otherwise. You understand?

492
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,542
Well, there it is,
just like he said.

493
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:42,750
The stranger's got everybody
turnin' on everybody.

494
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:46,833
Being put out in
the middle of the night!

495
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,583
That man!

496
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:53,167
Right here. Okay, folks,
put your bags right here in the wagon.

497
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:57,000
All right, folks. Just put your bags
right here in the wagon. Right here.

498
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:58,875
What's going on here?

499
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,208
What the hell does it look like
is going on, preacher?

500
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:03,292
They're emptying my whole hotel.

501
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,625
Throwing out payin' guests,
right into the street

502
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:08,583
just to make room for
our new guardian f... angel.

503
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,250
He likes to be by himself,
more or less.

504
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:15,750
You can see who's
runnin' our town now.

505
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:19,708
He's sitting right over there,
Mr. Belding.

506
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:23,750
If you don't like it, why don't you just
go over there and tell him that he can't?

507
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:26,208
Mordecai.

508
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:32,250
Someday soon someone's gonna step
on your scrawny little neck, you lizard,

509
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,377
and when they do,
you're gonna be nothing but a...

510
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:35,792
See here.

511
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,458
You can't turn all these
people out into the night.

512
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,458
It is inhuman, brother. Inhuman!

513
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,167
I'm not your brother.

514
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,250
We are all brothers
in the eyes of god.

515
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:55,458
All these people,
are they your sisters and brothers?

516
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,333
They most certainly are.

517
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:02,875
Then you won't mind if they come
over and stay at your place, will ya?

518
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,083
All right, folks, let's go.
Put your bags up here. Hurry up.

519
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,458
Ffiends! Friends, don't worry.

520
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:21,292
We shall find haven for you
in our own homes.

521
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,250
And it won't cost you one cent
more than regular hotel rates.

522
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:32,958
That's ridiculous.

523
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:41,792
My room ready?

524
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:45,417
Two connecting rooms.
The best in the hotel.

525
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:49,500
One for entertaining your many new
friends in town, and one for sleeping.

526
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,333
If your conscience
lets you sleep.

527
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:55,375
Oh, I sleep just fine, ma'am.

528
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:01,542
You care to see for yourself?

529
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,625
You tell Mrs. Belding
there'll be two for supper.

530
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:16,542
I like chicken. Fried.

531
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,583
And anything else?

532
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,958
Best bottle of wine in town.

533
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:29,000
Remember, he won't be
around forever, you little...

534
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:04,208
Marshal.

535
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:43,292
Somebody, please... help me.

536
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,500
What do you think you're doing?

537
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:50,458
Let go of me! You've got to stop this!
Let go of me!

538
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,708
Damn you all to hell.

539
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,750
- How did you get in here?
- Ah-ah!

540
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:37,583
You had your chance
and you missed it.

541
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,833
You're hurting me.
What do you want?

542
01:00:40,292 --> 01:00:43,375
Just a little pleasant
female company for supper.

543
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,583
- You know what you are?
- What?

544
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,083
You're an animal.

545
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,292
Well, you have a way
of bringing that out.

546
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,333
Thank you,
but I don't eat with dogs.

547
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,500
You might if it's the dog
that runs the pack.

548
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:10,625
Give me half an hour
to get ready.

549
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,042
You're ready right now.

550
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:15,042
I could be readier.

551
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:20,000
Half an hour.

552
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:35,708
You know, actually,
I eat like a bird.

553
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:38,417
- Huh.
- I got it.

554
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:42,708
I knew that old bastard Hobart
had it in a hole under the store.

555
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,708
- Look. I got it.
- Yeah, all the way from France.

556
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,500
Hey, would you stick a bent knife in that,
get the cork out?

557
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,833
Do you have any
special request for dessert?

558
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,583
No, I've already
taken care of that.

559
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:14,542
Can't fix that without
a blacksmith or a vet.

560
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:16,375
Maybe both.

561
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:18,458
Hell, we'll find
neither one out here.

562
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,500
Well, I'll tell you
something, stace.

563
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:24,125
I think we've been
pushin' too hard.

564
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:27,250
I mean, like as not, all three
of these horses could've come up lame.

565
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:31,792
Hell, I feel pretty lame myself, not being
on a horse 12 months in that damn jail.

566
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,792
Back off, Cole. Maybe we ought
to leave you and the horse here.

567
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:38,542
Now, stace,
I didn't mean nothin'.

568
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:42,750
Hell, stace, he can ride double with me
until we come across somebody.

569
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:44,250
We'll all need fresh animals.

570
01:02:44,417 --> 01:02:47,333
All right!
But quit cryin' about it.

571
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,833
I'll tell you what though.

572
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,000
Soon as they find
those bodies back there,

573
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,967
they're gonna have
a huntin' party out for us.

574
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:07,167
And I want time to take one year
of my life out of iago

575
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,625
before we move on.

576
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:10,542
How long's that gonna take,
you figure?

577
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,000
A lifetime...

578
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:15,000
For some of 'em.

579
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:57,167
- You're out late, mordecai.
- Huh?

580
01:04:17,583 --> 01:04:20,208
And fornication,
and sins of the flesh.

581
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:23,958
That's what's going on under my
roof right now while I'm talking to you.

582
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:26,250
That stranger has taken over
my whole hotel

583
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:29,875
and thrown good, honest,
decent folk right out into the night.

584
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:33,375
Well, why didn't you stop him,
Lewis? You've got a gun.

585
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:35,750
You shut your fat mouth, Sam.

586
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:38,417
We're tired of giving you money
for doing an incompetentjob.

587
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,833
- Don't you talk to me that way!
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

588
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:43,458
Please! Look at us!

589
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:46,000
Sweet god, look
what's happening to us!

590
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,042
Right. It's just like
the preacher says.

591
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,848
That stranger's got everybody in this town
at each other's throats.

592
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:52,292
He's set himself up like a king.

593
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:56,292
He's got you all snake-fascinated,
every damn one of you.

594
01:04:57,042 --> 01:05:00,583
This crazy picnic. Two hundred
gallons of blood-red paint.

595
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,470
It couldn't be worse if the devil
himself had ridden right into iago.

596
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:19,958
Welcome to iago,
you son of a bitch.

597
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:31,792
Get out of here!

598
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,917
What the...

599
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:43,875
I'm s o rry|

600
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,667
Morg!

601
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:09,917
Morg!

602
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,500
Where are you going?

603
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:16,083
Morg, take me with you!

604
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,417
Morg. Morg!

605
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:19,958
You better take me with you!

606
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:24,042
Morg! Where are you going?
Morg! Morg!

607
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:25,833
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!

608
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:28,500
Let's go.

609
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:47,083
Oh, no. Oh!

610
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,583
Oh, no.

611
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:05,167
My beautiful hotel. They
promised me that they wouldn't...

612
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:28,708
Ruined.

613
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,708
A total loss.

614
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,333
Didn't even touch my store.

615
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,708
Uh, look,
I want you to watch that pilfering.

616
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:38,708
I hold you responsible, sheriff.

617
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:41,083
- I'm not your goddamn sheriff.
- You.

618
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:45,500
I'll need one, two,
and two up there.

619
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,458
I'll need four boxes from you,

620
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:50,458
and shovels from you so
these people can dig the holes.

621
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:54,083
Well, um, yes,
but I thought perhaps we could...

622
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,583
- Right now.
- Yeah.

623
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,458
All right, everyone.

624
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:00,833
Uh, was you here?

625
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,375
I mean, did you see anything?

626
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:05,042
Somebody left the door open
and the wrong dogs came home.

627
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:07,375
Huh? Uh, yeah.

628
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:11,667
- Get the shovels, will ya?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

629
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:21,417
I, uh, hope you're not gonna
blame us for Morgan Allen's stupidity,

630
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:25,917
because the rest of us here
have an agreement with you.

631
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:29,000
Well, right now I don't
feel too agreeable.

632
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:31,042
Well, um,

633
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:34,292
maybe a little bonus will make
you a little more appreciative.

634
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:36,875
How little?

635
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:38,792
$500 a head.

636
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,292
Done.done.

637
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,208
$3,000?

638
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:01,167
You promised that
son of a bitch $3,000

639
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,042
after what he did to my hotel?

640
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,708
Promising's one thing.
Paying's another.

641
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:08,708
He may just catch a bullet.

642
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:16,000
Oh, you and Lewis
can grab shovels too.

643
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:21,958
I knew you were cruel,
but I didn't know how far you could go.

644
01:11:22,917 --> 01:11:24,458
Well, you still don't.

645
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:30,125
Well, it doesn't matter to you.

646
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,417
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep now.

647
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:37,292
Bodies everywhere. All the rooms
are ruined except for our room.

648
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:51,708
Wai... wait a minute.

649
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,458
Oh, no!

650
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:58,167
Oh, no. No!

651
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,250
No! Let go! Let go!

652
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,625
Lewis! Lewis!
Don't just stand there!

653
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:06,125
Let go of me! Let go!

654
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:10,333
Stop! Look, you don't need me.

655
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,958
Let go! Let go!

656
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,333
Let go of me!

657
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:26,875
- What are you gonna do with those?
- Defend myself.

658
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:29,000
Against what?

659
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:31,792
It's no secret what you
did to Callie Travers.

660
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,958
- Did?
- The other day in the stable.

661
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:38,917
Well... as I recall,

662
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:41,125
she enjoyed that quite a bit.

663
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:43,375
I promise you, I won't.

664
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:46,125
Well, you flatter
yourself, lady.

665
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,125
I flatter myself?

666
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,750
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you,

667
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:54,333
but a man's gotta
get his rest sometime.

668
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,042
Oblige me?

669
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,625
But I'll tell you what.

670
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:03,708
If you come back in about a half hour,
I'll see what I can do. All right?

671
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:08,250
Why, you low-down,
stinking, son of a...

672
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:41,333
Have you ever heard
the name Jim Duncan?

673
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:45,000
I've heard a lot of things. Why?

674
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:48,208
He was town marshal here.

675
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:51,542
He's lying out there
in an unmarked grave.

676
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,875
They say the dead don't rest

677
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:56,042
without a marker of some kind.

678
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:58,958
Do you believe that?

679
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,917
What makes you think I care?

680
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:04,458
I don't know.

681
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:08,167
He's the reason this town's
afraid of strangers.

682
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,083
I was going to
warn you about that.

683
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,333
Pretty funny.

684
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:16,667
What's fu n NY?

685
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,375
You ask me that
in a blown-up hotel

686
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:23,042
with seven dead men
to your credit already?

687
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:27,042
I was just stopping by
for a bottle of whiskey

688
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:29,208
and a nice hot bath.

689
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:33,375
All right. If you say so.

690
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:35,833
You don't believe me?

691
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:43,250
Mister, whatever you say
is fine with me.

692
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:52,375
Be careful.

693
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,542
You're a man who makes people afraid,
and that's dangerous.

694
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:04,708
Well, it's what people know about
themselves inside that makes them afraid.

695
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:20,958
I don't know if we shouldn't
Mark the grave somehow.

696
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,750
Sam?

697
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,958
I don't see any need.

698
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:28,875
Ain't likely anybody's
gonna cry over 'em anyhow.

699
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,417
You know what to do.

700
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:48,292
Yes, sir, captain.

701
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:52,042
All right.

702
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:56,208
Everybody grab a brush
and start in.

703
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,375
You mean, you want
the whole place painted?

704
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:02,333
Everything.

705
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,917
You can't possibly mean
the church, too.

706
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:07,333
I mean especially the church.

707
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,875
All right. I'll paint if
you say we've got to.

708
01:16:12,042 --> 01:16:14,917
But when we get done,
this place is gonna look like hell.

709
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,625
Hello, Lewis.

710
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,470
I want you to go to that meeting with me,
Sarah. It's very important.

711
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,583
Not now, not ever.

712
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:11,708
They are still your neighbors!

713
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:14,708
Yes, they're my neighbors,
and they make me sick.

714
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,750
Hiding behind words like
faith, peace, and trust.

715
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:20,875
Good words. Damn good words.

716
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:22,875
But we hid a murder behind them.

717
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:25,292
Will you never
understand, woman?

718
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:27,125
It wasn't anything
we wanted to do.

719
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:30,292
When Duncan found out the mine
was on government property...

720
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:32,125
Just a technicality, really...

721
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:33,875
He was determined to turn us in.

722
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,500
Wouldn't listen to reason.

723
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,208
Is that why?

724
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,708
Is that really why it happened?

725
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:44,417
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have closed down the mine.

726
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:46,934
Do you know what would've
happened to this town then?

727
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,458
Would've been the end of
everything that we've worked on.

728
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:52,625
All of it. All of us.
And you too, wife.

729
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:57,250
Now...

730
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:00,542
Sometimes we have to do
what's necessary to do

731
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,375
for the good of everybody.

732
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,285
That's the price of progress.

733
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:07,125
And what's the price
of a human life, Lewis?

734
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:10,000
Ask your good friends
if they know that.

735
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,792
Your damn conscience.

736
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:18,375
I'll say it's sure taken a
hell of a while to bother you.

737
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,292
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.

738
01:18:22,792 --> 01:18:24,417
I won't be coming back.

739
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:23,458
That's morg Allen,
or what's left of him.

740
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,875
Well, now, what's he doing
ridin' around here like that?

741
01:19:27,042 --> 01:19:30,958
He's come back to pay us back for
some jail time that was rightfully his,

742
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,625
only he don't know it.

743
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,917
Stacey, help me.

744
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,042
My arm. Help me.

745
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:03,667
Help me, Stacey.

746
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:08,458
I'm curious, morg.

747
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,958
You helped them railroad us,

748
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:15,292
and you got the balls to come
down here and ask us for a favor?

749
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,542
Goddamn, if I don't admire you.

750
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,417
Do something about my arm, Stacey.

751
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,542
Well, I am doing
something, morg...

752
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:26,375
Sitting here watching
you bleed to death.

753
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,333
Stacey, things
have changed in iago.

754
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,458
You need me.

755
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:38,375
I gotta tell you about it.

756
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:42,000
I gotta tell you about it.

757
01:20:43,667 --> 01:20:47,042
From the looks of your arm, morg, looks
like you've run your welcome out in iago.

758
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:48,667
And ours too.

759
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:51,125
What me and the boys
want to know is

760
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:53,458
how we're gonna pick up
12 months' back pay

761
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:54,893
and everything else
that's owed us.

762
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:57,250
- Stacey, for god's sakes.
- No, no.

763
01:20:57,417 --> 01:20:58,542
For our sake.

764
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,684
Now, you can help us, all right,
and you can help yourself too.

765
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:05,083
Now, you just give me
the combination to that big iron box

766
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,542
in the back of your office,

767
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,125
and me and the boys will just...

768
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:12,500
Sneak right in there real quiet-like,

769
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:15,625
take what's ours, bring you the rest,
or leave it there safe and sound.

770
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:16,792
That's up to you.

771
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:21,000
First, of course,
we'll... fix up your arm,

772
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:25,083
set you over there in the shade
with a nice canteen full of water.

773
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,458
You no-good,
worthless son of a bitch.

774
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:30,917
You're probably right
about that.

775
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:36,833
Give me that combination, morg.

776
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,833
I wouldn't give you the
combination to the gates of hell.

777
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:51,542
Ugh! Dog!

778
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:54,125
Sure had a lot of blood
left in him, didn't he?

779
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,583
Two sticks of dynamite'll take care of
that iron box anyway. We don't need him.

780
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,208
- Dan, you hit?
- I don't know.

781
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:30,333
I don't think so.

782
01:22:31,042 --> 01:22:32,708
Damn near tore my leg off!

783
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:40,250
Who the hell is that?

784
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:42,167
Must be Dave Drake.

785
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:46,875
What the hell did you hit?

786
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:09,083
- Keep shootin', damn it!
- He shot my ear off!

787
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:11,542
Somebody up there's
playing games.

788
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,250
He shot my ear off!

789
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:19,583
Well, he could've shot your whole
damn head off! Now get down!

790
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,000
Dave, is that you?

791
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,667
Come on out! We'll settle this!

792
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,833
Morg was almost dead anyway
from that arm!

793
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,292
I just put him
out of his misery!

794
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,458
I'll kill you!

795
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,292
You son of a bitch,
I'll kill you!

796
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:16,417
Come down out of there,
you bastard!

797
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:17,792
I'll cut your heart out!

798
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:20,478
Don't you go up there, stace.
There might be some more dynamite.

799
01:24:21,042 --> 01:24:24,458
I'll get him. I'll get him,
whoever it was up there.

800
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,792
I'll kill every man in iago!

801
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:13,684
The guests are on their way to the party,
so gather all the people together.

802
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:16,500
Right, captain! All right,
men, get that sign up!

803
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,250
Come on! They're coming!

804
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:41,333
All right, everybody, come on,
get a little move on!

805
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,667
I want you up in that tower.

806
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,643
First sign of dust,
you ring the bell, ya hear?

807
01:25:56,667 --> 01:26:00,000
- Are you sure this is gonna be all right?
- It's gonna be all right.

808
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:08,042
He's back! He's here!
It's time to get ready.

809
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,792
What's the matter
with everybody?

810
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,042
Wait'll we gun 'em down.

811
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:16,292
Bang, bang, bang!

812
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,125
All right, everybody, I...

813
01:26:19,917 --> 01:26:21,583
I think we're expected outside.

814
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,708
I just hope that shooter
we hired is feelin' up to snuff.

815
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:26,375
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

816
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:34,417
Let's go.

817
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,833
Hey, sefior, can we
come to the fiesta?

818
01:27:34,042 --> 01:27:35,833
I want everybody
to have plenty of those.

819
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:54,292
Hey, ain't it about time,
uh, we got out there, huh?

820
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,625
There's plenty of time.

821
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,500
Yeah, but they'll be here
any damn minute.

822
01:28:00,792 --> 01:28:04,083
- I think Sam's right. We ought to.
- Yeah.

823
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:05,542
What about after?

824
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,000
What about after we do it?

825
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:11,583
- Hmm?
- What do we do then?

826
01:28:14,167 --> 01:28:15,292
Then you live with it.

827
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,292
Uh, yeah.

828
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:30,750
Where you gonna be?

829
01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:32,708
Are you gonna
take the first shot?

830
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,875
Are you gonna get
Stacey Bridges first?

831
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:39,208
Or maybe you're gonna get
all three by yourself?

832
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:48,485
When are you gonna
give the signal?

833
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:51,625
I'm not. You are.

834
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:06,500
You old people, move outta here!

835

01:33:13,042 --> 01:33:15,208
A party? A party!

844
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,375
Welcome home party, huh?

845
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:35,125
Well... here's to your party.

846
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,375
Give me another bottle.

01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,667
Give me another bottle!

848
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,333
Well, now the party's over.

849
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,667
- Stace!
- Let go of me!

850
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:10,833
- Look what I found in the bushes.
- Let go!

851
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:14,708
Look what I found in the bushes!

852
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:22,250
Stacey, it was always you.

853
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,417
That's why morg Allen hated you.

854
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:30,083
He knew how much I loved you.

855
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:35,583
Yeah, I bet you just cried
yourself to sleep every night

856
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:39,333
thinking about me
in that territorial prison.

857
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:44,167
But I did. I really did!

858
01:34:44,333 --> 01:34:47,125
Yeah, well,
I can see it all now.

859
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:50,083
You lying there
in morg Allen's bed

860
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,583
just cryin' and a-humpin'.

861
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:55,333
Oh, no! No!

862
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,917
Give me that bottle.

863
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:04,542
Cole, go and get
the horses ready.

864
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:05,792
You got it, stace.

865
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:08,208
Stacey...

866
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:11,500
Stacey, you're gonna take me
with you, aren't you?

867
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:16,042
I can do better than you
in a four-bit fancy house.

868
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:21,375
You still here?

869
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:23,458
Goddamn right I'm still here.

870
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:26,445
I wanna know who them sons
of bitches was that ambushed us.

871
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:28,000
That's what I'd like to know.

872
01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:31,708
Well, that's what we're
gonna find out right now.

873
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:45,583
Who are you?

874
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:47,292

Stacey,

896
01:38:07,917 --> 01:38:09,750
Go on. Go on!

897

899
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:45,333
Who are you?

I'm just about done here.

902

I never did know your name.

903
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:26,708
Yes, you do.

904
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:30,667
Take care.

905
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:34,125
Yes, sir, captain.
