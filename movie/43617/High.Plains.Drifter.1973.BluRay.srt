1
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,734
Yah! Let's go, buster.

2
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,651
Beer.

3
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,320
And a bottle.

4
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,698
Ain't much good.

5
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,535
It's all there is.

6
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,635
Will you want
anything else?

7
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,179
Just a peaceful hour
to drink it in.

8
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,830
Flea-bitten range bums
don't usually stop in Lago.

9
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,425
Life here's a little
too quick for them.

10
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,142
Maybe you think
you're fast enough
to keep up with us, huh?

11
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,379
A lot faster than
you'll ever live to be.

12
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,905
Yes, sir?

13
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,366
Shave and a hot bath?

14
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,243
That'll be 90 cents.

15
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,641
Cash.

16
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,979
Well, what I mean to say
is that the 90 cents
usually comes first.

17
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,189
But, hell,
it don't really matter.

18
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,692
Before or after,
what's the diff?

19
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,695
Sir.

20
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,212
Eau de lilac's
only 10 cents more.

21
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,840
Lilac water.
Oh, the ladies love it.

22
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,759
Shall we make it
an even dollar? Hmm. No.

23
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,891
Yes.

24
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,576
Moses.

25
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,677
Right you are, gentlemen.

26
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,347
Be right with you.
Just have a chair.

27
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,103
What, you don't
like our company?

28
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,275
What's the matter with you?

29
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,322
I'm speaking to you,
pig shit.

30
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,034
I think he's got
some of that pig shit
in his ear.

31
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,996
I don't know
which smells worse,
him or the shit in the bottle.

32
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,911
What did you say
your name was again?

33
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,581
I didn't.

34
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,044
No. I guess you
didn't at that, did you?

35
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,379
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

36
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,548
Look at this.
It's ruined.

37
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,675
There's no need
for all that.

38
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
All what?

39
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:09,097
If you
want to get acquainted,
why don't you just say so?

40
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,517
Acquainted?

41
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,770
Why, you'd be amusing
if you weren't so pathetic.

42
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,316
Just a minute.
I'm not finished
with you yet.

43
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,070
You know, at a distance,
you'd almost pass for a man.

44
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,865
But you're
certainly a disappointment
up close, aren't you?

45
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,417
To your feet, ma'am.
They're almost as big
as your mouth.

46
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,796
You know what you are?
Hmm?

47
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,756
Just trash.

48
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,677
A bottle of whiskey
for courage and the manners
of a goat.

49
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,766
You're the one who could
use a lesson in manners.

50
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,977
Not from you,
whiskey breath.

51
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,645
Let go of me!

52
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,647
Let go!

53
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,404
Let go of me!

54
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,449
Let go of me, you!
Put me down!

55
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,493
Help me!

56
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,957
What are you doing?

57
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,562
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

58
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,024
My horse.

59
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,151
A room.

60
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,245
Would you like to register,
please, sir?

61
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,409
Somebody, please help me.

62
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,761
Damn you all to hell.

63
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,580
Good morning. Sleep well?
Yeah.

64
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,083
Say, are you
planning to stay,

65
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,918
keep your room
another night?

66
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,547
I'll let you know.

67
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,215
All right,
anything you say.

68
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,078
Morning.

69
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,900
I've still got a bath coming.

70
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,527
Nice hot bath
coming right up.
Yes, sir.

71
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,323
Mordecai,
you put some more hot water
in that tub there.

72
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,492
This gentleman wants a bath.

73
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,579
You can hang
your clothes right down there
on the peg.

74
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,290
Now, Miss Peekins
does a nice...
Oh, I'm sorry.

75
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,625
Right this way,
Captain, sir.

76
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,460
Unless you want
Mordecai to take them out

77
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,961
and get them laundered
while you're soaking.

78
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,756
Miss Peekins does
a right clean boiled wash.

79
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,468
Uses lye
for pants rabbits, she does.
No itch, no scratch.

80
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,646
Well,
pour the water, Mordecai,
before it gets cold.

81
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,024
We want the gentleman
to be comfortable.

82
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:24,170
Well, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

83
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,010
I might as well
get this stool here

84
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,388
and set right down
and do it, right?

85
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,143
If that's all right
with you, huh?

86
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,780
Well, what's it about
is Billy Borders.

87
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,534
Don't know the man.

88
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:59,581
Well, you missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.

89
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,334
Him and Ike Sharp
and Fred Morris.

90
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:11,092
You know,
those are just the names,
in case you're interested.

91
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,304
Well, I'm not really
interested, Sheriff.

92
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,973
Well, I can't say
I blame you, you know.

93
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,601
Billy, he wasn't
a loved man, no.

94
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,227
And he didn't have
much personality.

95
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:24,522
What he did have
was all bad, just bad.

96
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,403
What you're trying to say is
there's no charge, right?

97
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,863
Uh...

98
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,366
Well, forgive and forget,
you know.

99
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,119
That's our motto.

100
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,418
You dirty bastard!

101
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,338
I'll kill you!

102
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,174
Damn it, Callie!

103
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,264
Callie, damn it!

104
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,808
Let go of me, you fat lug!

105
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,143
Stop... Ouch!

106
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,896
Tell him I'd appreciate it

107
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,650
if he doesn't leave town
until I talk to him.

108
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,153
Goddamn it!

109
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,404
I'll kill you!

110
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,122
I wonder what took her
so long to get mad.

111
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,668
Because maybe
you didn't go back for more.

112
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,047
It don't seem to me
that we got a choice.

113
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,841
Seeing we got no time
to send for help,

114
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,969
and further seeing
that our sheriff's

115
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,554
about as much use
as tits on a boar.

116
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,307
Sorry I'm late.
Anything happen?

117
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,434
No, no,
His Honor's had the floor.

118
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,644
In case
you haven't heard it yet,

119
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,106
Stacey Bridges
and the Carlin brothers are
due to get out of jail today.

120
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,440
They coming here?

121
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,317
That's been their plan,
according to all reports.

122
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,111
There's no reason to believe
they've changed it.

123
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,530
Possibly they've
repented their ways.

124
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,741
Preacher, they're gonna
burn this town to the ground
and you know it.

125
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,744
What we're talking about now
is a way to stop them.

126
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,622
We gotta find that way now
and quick.

127
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,583
Nevertheless,
my conscience will not
allow me to be a party

128
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,669
to the hiring
of a professional gunfighter.

129
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:14,048
Well, maybe you'd like to go
out there and stand them off
yourself, Preacher.

130
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,967
I'm just a simple man of God.

131
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,761
Well, it's time
we unsimplified you,
Reverend.

132
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,180
Now, Borders,
Morris and Short were
professional gunfighters

133
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,141
on the payroll
of the Lago Mining Company

134
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,144
to protect our interests
and the interests
of this town,

135
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,478
which are identical.

136
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,732
They stood around
drinking beer and looking
snotty for a full year.

137
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,525
And then one day
before we actually needed
the bastards,

138
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,777
they managed to get
themselves killed.

139
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,029
So if you've got
a suggestion,

140
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,488
we'd be delighted
to hear it.

141
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:42,368
Otherwise, take your
conscience elsewhere while we
think about saving your ass.

142
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,164
Land's sakes.
Where's time gone to, huh?

143
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,959
Miss Peekins' eldest
is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...

144
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,504
Will you gentlemen
excuse me?

145
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,139
Well, we were talking
about hiring a gunfighter.

146
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,099
Yeah, we don't know anything
about that fellow there.

147
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,768
Well, we know
he took the best
we could find to hire,

148
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,311
like Grant took Vicksburg.

149
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,605
Yeah, with a hidden gun
in his lap.

150
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,692
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.

151
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,278
Goddamndest shooting
I ever even heard of.

152
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,697
I still say
we're asking for trouble!

153
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,200
A fellow like that,
what do we know about him?

154
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,368
Who is he?
Where does he come from?

155
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,495
Well, you've got
our permission to go
and ask him.

156
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,459
Although, the last three
that tried that didn't
fare all that well.

157
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,169
Let me out!

158
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,507
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!

159
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,343
Get the hell off me!
Let go of me!

160
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,636
You fat pig!

161
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,305
Hey, come here.
What is this?

162
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,392
I was just down there
sounding out that stranger,

163
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,394
when she come in there
blasting away
like a Cheyenne!

164
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,020
All right, Sam.
All right.

165
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,564
You're planning
to let him get away
with this, aren't you?

166
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,608
Be a little patient,
will you?
Patient?

167
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,236
Callie, when you run
across a man who's used
to having his own way,

168
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,155
you let him have it
until he goes too far.

169
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,617
Just what do you consider
going too far?

170
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,413
I mean, isn't forcible rape
in broad daylight
a misdemeanor in this town?

171
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,165
There's too much at stake
to throw away
on hysterics now.

172
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,959
Hysterics?

173
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,964
Well, I can remember
some hysterics one night
not too long ago.

174
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,674
Callie, keep your
mouth shut!

175
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,386
Morgan, get her out of here.

176
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,847
I'll see you later.

177
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,598
Yeah.

178
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,560
Not while
that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch

179
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,812
is still breathing,
you won't!

180
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,524
You wonder if there's
a man left in this town!

181
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:41,320
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!

182
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,076
Well...

183
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
Why not?

184
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,625
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.

185
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,255
Oh, now, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid. You...

186
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,176
Besides, I have nothing
against these men.

187
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,511
Who did you say they are?

188
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,432
Well, Stacey Bridges
and his cousins,
the Carlin boys,

189
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,642
they worked
for the company. They...

190
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,437
You know, what you
call troubleshooters.

191
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,524
You know,
just like those three
you done in yesterday,

192
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,319
except when
they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.

193
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,653
And they
took care of it, too.

194
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,449
Except, well,
they got too damn big
for their britches.

195
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,912
Started pushing people around,
and taking over the town
and we had to...

196
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,622
Had to what?

197
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,793
Well, we had to
take them into custody,
that's what.

198
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,672
Yeah.
I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.

199
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:57,271
Hey, you won't be
wanting that slab of pie,
will you?

200
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,404
You know
what happened, friend,

201
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,200
is they stole a golden ingot
out of the mining office
down there,

202
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,369
and they hid it
under the floorboard

203
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,538
of the shack
that they lived in.

204
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,207
Kind of careless
of them, wasn't it?
Huh?

205
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,461
I mean, does a mining company
usually leave gold ingots
lying around like that?

206
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,713
Well, it does seem
a bit peculiar, you know.

207
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,591
Matter of fact,
Stacey kept bringing that up
at the trial all the time,

208
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,469
saying that he was being
railroaded with.

209
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,180
And do you know that's why
they're mad at us?

210
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,141
No, I'll tell you
what you can do, Sheriff.
What?

211
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,727
When those boys
come back to town,

212
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,230
you just clap the bracelets
right on them.

213
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,065
Me?
Yeah.

214
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,109
Well, I might have
forgot to mention

215
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,779
that they were
all three passed out
at the time, you know?

216
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,448
Look, I'm no lawman.

217
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,701
You know, they just
hung this thing on me

218
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,203
when that young
Marshal Duncan was killed.

219
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,747
You know,
he was whipped to death
right here in this street.

220
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,709
Bullwhipped.
Damndest thing I ever saw.

221
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,671
Now, why would anybody
want to do a thing like that?

222
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,633
Well, I don't know.
It wasn't anybody
from this town, anyhow.

223
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:08,843
How do you know?

224
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,096
Well, this is a good town,
and these are good people.

225
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,640
And look, friend,
we sure would like it

226
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,684
if you'd help us
with our problem.

227
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,689
Only problem
you've got, Sheriff,
is a short supply of guts.

228
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,108
You people don't need me.

229
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,235
Look.

230
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,404
Place a couple
of good riflemen

231
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,531
on top of that
building up there.

232
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,742
Maybe a couple more
with shotguns

233
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,452
down behind grain bags
over there.

234
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,622
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there
in the bell tower.

235
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,249
Maybe a rifleman.
That should just
about take care of it.

236
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,878
Well, what would it take
to see that through,
you know?

237
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,631
The ambush.
What would it cost us?

238
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,051
Sheriff, I don't know
if I really like
this town that much.

239
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,971
Well,
this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.

240
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,058
You like them,
you save them.

241
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,271
Look, what if we offered you
anything you want?

242
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,862
Anything?

243
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,074
Unlimited credit.
That's what it means.

244
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,577
An open charge account
with no reckoning.

245
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,747
What His Honor's
trying to say is

246
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,250
you got yourself a free hand
in this town, friend.

247
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,002
Any damn thing I want, huh?

248
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,629
Yeah. Go on.
Help yourself.

249
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,423
Help yourself!
Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.

250
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,592
Yes, sir.
Anything you want
that's here,

251
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,969
as best as we can
get it for you, we will.

252
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,973
Even if it's some
little squaw or a Mex

253
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,434
and keep your bed
warm at night.

254
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,228
Hey, you!

255
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,855
Keep your sticky fingers
off them blankets
if you're not buying.

256
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,983
And keep them
kids under control.
Goddamn savages.

257
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,237
And besides, you know,
about handling that ambush,

258
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,074
you know, everybody in town,
more or less,
is at your orders.

259
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,428
Here you go.

260
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,473
No, no. No.

261
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,309
Tell him it's all right.

262
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,687
It's all right.

263
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,354
Anything I want?

264
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,447
Now, how's that feel?

265
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,658
Not bad. I'll take them.

266
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,828
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots

267
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,539
and a tooled belt
with silver buckle.

268
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,126
Let's see, that'll be,
five and two,
carry the nine,

269
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,213
and that comes to exactly...

270
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,547
No charge.

271
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,397
Come on, now.

272
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,320
I'd like to get
all these people a drink.

273
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,324
Yes, sir.
One round for the house.
There you are.

274
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,662
This gentleman here's
buying a round
for the house.

275
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,707
No fair. No fair.
I ordered one, too. Don't I
get a glass of beer?

276
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,835
You get a glass of beer,
right there.
Coming up.

277
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,174
There we are.

278
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:03,888
Now, that's one round
for the house, sir.
Anything else?

279
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,222
Get yourself something.

280
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,642
Oh, thank you
very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.

281
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,563
And smoke it later.

282
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:18,694
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.

283
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,363
There's no charge, Lutie.

284
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,489
Huh?

285
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,660
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants
in this town, he gets.

286
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,912
You voted on it.

287
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,289
I didn't know
that meant free whiskey.

288
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,834
Well, everybody's
got to put something
in the kitty, right?

289
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,796
Right.

290
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,763
About time this town
had a new sheriff.

291
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,936
I'm the sheriff?
I'm the sheriff.

292
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,522
I'm sorry, Sam.

293
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,901
But you looked so comical
when he put your badge
on the runt.

294
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,820
I'm not a runt anymore.
I'm the sheriff.

295
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,865
And the mayor.

296
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,450
And I'm the mayor.

297
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,118
Any objections?

298
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,703
No. No, that's fine.

299
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,542
I'm the mayor.
I'm the sheriff.

300
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,755
No more,
"Mordecai, bring the water.

301
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,967
"Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess."

302
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,261
Hot damn!
I'm gonna declare a holiday.

303
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,722
Hot damn!

304
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,641
Wait a minute.

305
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,020
I can't be a sheriff
if I don't have a gun.

306
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,025
Is this about the size gun
you're looking for?

307
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,152
No, that one.
That'll do.

308
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,163
Whatever this gent wants,
he's to have.

309
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,916
That's orders of Mr. Drake
and Mr. Allen.

310
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,045
I want every man
in the regiment to have
one of these nice rifles.

311
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,672
What regiment?

312
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,844
The City of Lago Volunteers.

313
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,429
Never heard of them.

314
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,431
Why, you ought to,
you're in it.

315
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,517
So are you, you,
and all of you out there.

316
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,895
I want you all
out in the street
in 10 minutes for drill.

317
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,122
Well, that's that.

318
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,972
Bridges, you Carlin boys,

319
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,643
don't forget
your tickets back here
to my little hotel.

320
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,313
And don't worry.
They ain't loaded.

321
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,192
What about our horses?

322
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,029
We had three good animals.

323
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,657
What do you think
you've been eating
the last six months?

324
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,249
Damn him! Dog, I didn't
eat my own horse!

325
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,960
That slop he fed us
wasn't our horses.

326
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,587
He just stole them
and sold them to somebody.

327
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,713
That's what he done!
Shut up.

328
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,257
Well, that's what he done!
Shut up.

329
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,844
When we get to Lago,
you can have
the mayor's horse.

330
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,888
Fried or barbecued.

331
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,683
Well, I guess we walk some.

332
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,895
Old Drake and Allen
don't seem
to have remembered.

333
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,731
Oh, they'll remember.

334
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,318
One way or another,
they'll remember.

335
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,959
All right.

336
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,045
You don't wanna get shot.

337
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,882
You don't want your shops
or your houses burned.

338
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,343
You don't want
your women touched.

339
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,054
You don't want
anything to happen.

340
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,891
Except you're afraid
to do anything about it.

341
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,854
Or you don't know how.

342
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,865
Shit.

343
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,468
Fire! Fire!

344
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,809
Come on, fire!

345
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,713
I don't remember
lending my wagons

346
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,799
to be shot up
by these goddamn fools
out here.

347
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,929
You know,
you're gonna look
awfully silly

348
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,307
with that knife
sticking up your ass.

349
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:11,690
Fire!
Pull those triggers!
Come on, shoot!

350
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,317
Shoot!

351
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,193
Aim! Fire!

352
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,452
You still here?

353
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,873
No. No, I was...
I was just going.

354
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,347
Damn! Can you
do that every time?

355
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:44,931
Damn right he can.

356
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,726
We're not gonna have a thing
in the world to worry about.

357
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,936
This is gonna be a picnic!

358
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,689
All right,
keep them after us, huh?

359
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,484
Go on, out there.

360
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,290
You men carpenters?

361
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,001
Sí, señor.
We do rough fixing.

362
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,920
Could you make
some tables, big ones,

363
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,630
that a lot
of people could sit?

364
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,923
Like for a church picnic?

365
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,049
Exactly.

366
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:24,471
Well, you could use sawhorses
and one-by-twelves.

367
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,557
Could you have
them ready for me
by tomorrow morning?

368
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,725
If we have the lumber.

369
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,810
You'll have the lumber.

370
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,478
Come on with me.

371
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,356
You really
planning a picnic?

372
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,649
Any objection?

373
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,193
No, just
it's the damndest thing
I ever heard of.

374
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,237
You haven't heard
the funny part.
What's that?

375
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,738
You're furnishing
the beer and whiskey.

376
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,209
Oh, Preacher.

377
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,419
Good morning,
Brother Belding.

378
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,254
Mrs. Lake was just
asking about you.

379
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,922
Oh, how is
the dear old soul?

380
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,465
Oh, she's chipper
as a jaybird.

381
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,591
I don't know
how she does it.

382
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,885
Well, she's got
the strength of her faith,
Brother Belding.

383
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,012
Praise God.
The strength of her faith.

384
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,515
Too bad about your barn.
Termites?

385
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,977
There's nothing
wrong with my barn.
It's sound as a dollar.

386
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,230
Then how come
those two Mexs
is tearing it down?

387
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,440
What?

388
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:31,288
What do
you greasy bastards think
you're doing to my barn?

389
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:32,998
Exactly what I told them.

390
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:35,834
We're requisitioning
your barn, Belding.

391
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,004
Any objection?

392
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,843
You men
can go back to work.

393
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,140
Would you mind telling me
what the hell's
going on here?

394
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,142
And you can help out, too.

395
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,813
You mean,
you want me to help you
tear down my barn?

396
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,025
Wait a minute.

397
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,818
Maybe he'd be better use

398
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,779
if he'd help us
collect the few little items
we're still missing.

399
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:07,324
Items? What items? What for?

400
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,951
You got the list, Sheriff.
Read it to him.

401
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:15,415
We still need 35 bedsheets,

402
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,628
one barbecued steer
and 200 gallons
of red paint.

403
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,048
Red paint?

404
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,926
We're counting on you
for the bedsheets.

405
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,720
Is there anything else?

406
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,888
Yes, there is.

407
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,558
How long is it gonna take you
to get everybody
out of your hotel?

408
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,311
What?

409
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,855
Everybody out.
How long is it gonna take?

410
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,025
Why, I just can't...

411
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,945
I mean, I got eight people
living in rooms up there
in my hotel.

412
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,656
Now, I just...
Where are they gonna go?

413
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,283
Out.

414
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,718
You know better than to walk
in a man's camp and...

415
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,390
What the hell is going on?

416
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:06,443
Well, Stacey, looks like
we got three fresh horses.

417
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,820
Wait a while.

418
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,575
He's got him
some snappy duds.

419
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:39,976
Faster!

420
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,899
Fire! Pull that trigger!

421
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,528
Go on!

422
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,660
Go on!

423
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,830
Shoot!

424
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,963
Pull that trigger!

425
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,048
Fire!

426
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,009
Any improvement?

427
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,344
Uh, some.

428
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,346
You know,
Lew and I were thinking,

429
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,598
maybe we were a little
hasty in our decision.

430
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:19,933
What do you mean?

431
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,894
Well, maybe we don't
need any outside help
to solve our problem.

432
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,021
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't
even have a problem.

433
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,231
Every man
who ever got sent up,

434
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,525
went away saying
he's gonna come back
and get even, right?

435
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,693
But think about it.

436
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,319
Can you actually
remember anyone ever

437
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:32,862
coming back
and doing anything?

438
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,239
I can't think of one.
Can you?

439
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,033
The point being, you want
to get rid of the gunfighter.
Is that it?

440
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,327
Now, Dave, we got to
before it's too late.

441
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,579
He's making a mock
of this whole town.

442
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,165
Making that
little dwarf the sheriff.

443
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,834
Kicking my own people
out of my own hotel.

444
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,128
Got half of the women in town
sewing bedsheets together.

445
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,212
They're my bedsheets!

446
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,589
Got those Mexicans down there
building long picnic tables.

447
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,717
Lutie Naylor, down there
barbecuing a whole damn steer.

448
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,635
Some kind of a picnic.

449
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,595
Right here in our own town.

450
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,055
Sounds pretty good to me.

451
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,432
What do you mean?

452
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,142
I mean,
it sounds like a good idea,

453
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,519
bringing everything
out in the open
so we can see it.

454
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,562
Don't you see
what we're saying?

455
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,813
This whole thing's
all for nothing.

456
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,106
They're probably
all three blind drunk

457
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,566
in some Nogales whorehouse
right now.

458
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,277
Well, if they're
dead drunk in Nogales,
we'll know in 24 hours.

459
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,779
Surely we can
put up with the man
for one more day.

460
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,406
No. I say no.

461
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,744
He's got this whole town
so people are beginning
to turn on each other.

462
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:25,081
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?

463
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,461
You want to spell
that out, Drake?

464
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,545
Spell it yourself.

465
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,464
I'm not gonna
jeopardize everything
I've built here

466
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,549
because some blond bitch
and he threw you out of bed.

467
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,925
God damn you!
Don't talk to me that way.

468
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,093
I'll talk to you
any way I like!

469
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,595
I'll say
anything I have to say

470
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:39,804
as long as
I'm running this company.

471
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:40,889
Well, say it,
but you could listen

472
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,182
once in a while yourself,
you know.

473
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,266
What's the matter, Morgan?

474
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,101
You're not getting
your fair share
of the profits?

475
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,103
Profits.
It's not the profits.

476
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,230
It's just that
this whole business
has gone sour

477
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,025
since that deal with
that former Marshal Duncan.

478
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,903
Wait a minute, we had
no choice in that matter,
and you know it.

479
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,112
Come on!
Wait a minute...

480
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,782
The big mistake we made
was hiring that man Duncan
in the first place,

481
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,784
and you did that
all by yourself.
All by myself?

482
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,662
Quiet. Shut up.
We can trust one another.
Guys, please...

483
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,793
This whole town
had a hand
in what happened.

484
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,881
Hell, why do you
think Stacey Bridges
and the Carlin brothers

485
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,592
kept their mouths shut
all this time?

486
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,303
Same reason
everybody else
did in this town.

487
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,931
One hang, we all hang.

488
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,978
Now, you just grit your teeth
a little bit longer.

489
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,482
The gunfighter stays
till I say otherwise.
You understand?

490
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,534
Well, there it is,
just like he said.

491
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,869
That stranger's got everybody
turning on everybody.

492
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,706
Being put out
after all these years.

493
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,501
That man!

494
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,752
Right here.

495
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,672
Okay, folks,
put your bags right here
in the wagon.

496
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,340
All right, folks,
just put your bags

497
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,634
right here in the wagon.
Right here.

498
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,094
What's going on here?

499
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,221
What the hell
does it look like
is going on, Preacher?

500
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,181
They're emptying
my whole hotel.

501
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,517
Throwing out paying guests,
right into the street

502
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,854
just to make room
for our new guardian angel.

503
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:14,482
He likes
to be by himself,
more or less.

504
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,319
You see who's running
our town now?

505
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,323
He's sitting right
over there, Mr. Belding.

506
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,616
If you don't like it

507
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,035
why don't
you just go over there
and tell him that he can't?

508
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,246
Mordecai,

509
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:34,168
someday soon someone's
going to step on your scrawny
little neck, you lizard,

510
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,379
and when they do,
you're going to be nothing
but a squished monster.

511
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,964
See here,

512
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,216
you can't turn
all these people out
into the night.

513
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,844
It is inhuman, brother.
Inhuman!

514
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,558
I'm not your brother.

515
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,394
We are all brothers
in the eyes of God.

516
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,817
All these people,
are they your
sisters and brothers?

517
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,486
They most certainly are.

518
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,573
Then you won't mind
if they come over

519
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,325
and stay at your place,
will you?

520
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,920
All right, folks,
let's go! Put your bags
up here! Let's hurry up!

521
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,505
Friends, friends,
don't worry.

522
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,885
We shall find haven
for you in our own homes.

523
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:27,805
And it won't cost you
one cent more than
regular hotel rates.

524
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,188
Paid up,
that's ridiculous.

525
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,197
My room ready?

526
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,700
Two connecting rooms,
the best in the hotel.

527
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,370
One for entertaining
your many new friends
in town,

528
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,246
and one for sleeping.

529
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:55,124
If your conscience
lets you sleep.

530
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,961
Oh, I sleep
just fine, ma'am.

531
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,712
Is that so?

532
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,300
You care to see for yourself?

533
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,938
You tell Mrs. Belding
there'll be two for supper.

534
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,107
I like chicken, fried.

535
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,194
And anything else?

536
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,738
Best bottle of wine in town.

537
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,661
Remember, he won't
be around forever,
you little...

538
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,380
Marshal.

539
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,188
Somebody, please help me.

540
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,192
What are you doing?

541
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,068
Let go of me!
You've got to stop this!
Not now!

542
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,112
Let go of me!

543
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,124
Damn you all to hell.

544
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,257
How did you get in here?

545
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,261
You had your chance
and you missed it.

546
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,638
You're hurting me.
What do you want?

547
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,891
Just a little
pleasant female company
for supper.

548
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,394
You know what you are?
What?

549
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,645
You're an animal.

550
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,897
Yeah, well,
you have a way
of bringing that out.

551
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,442
No, thank you,
but I don't eat with dogs.

552
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,862
You might,
if it's the dog
that runs the pack.

553
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,544
Give me a half an hour
to get ready.

554
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,421
You're ready right now.

555
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,132
I could be readier.

556
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,762
Half an hour.

557
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:38,277
You know, actually,
I eat like a bird.

558
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,780
I've got it.

559
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,284
I knew that old bastard
Hobart had it in a hole
under the store.

560
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:46,786
Look. But I've got it.

561
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,371
Yeah, all the way
from France.

562
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:52,291
Yeah, would you stick
a bent knife in that,
get the cork out?

563
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,961
Do you have
any special request
for dessert?

564
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,840
No, I've already
taken care of that.

565
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,901
Can't fix that without
a blacksmith or a vet.
Maybe both.

566
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,654
Hell, we'll find
neither one out here.

567
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,532
Well, I'll tell
you something, Stace.

568
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,784
I think we've been
pushing too hard.

569
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:30,496
I mean, like as not,
all three of these horses
could have come up lame.

570
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,500
Hell, I feel pretty lame
myself, not being on a horse
12 months in that damn jail.

571
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,584
Back off, Cole.

572
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:38,671
Maybe we ought to leave you
and the horse here.

573
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,298
Well, now, Stace,
I didn't mean nothing.

574
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,261
Hell, Stacey, he can ride
double with me until
we come across somebody.

575
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,887
We'll all need
fresh animals.

576
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,849
All right!
Quit crying about it.

577
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,109
I'll tell you what, though.

578
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,445
Soon as they find
those bodies back there,

579
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,156
they're gonna have
a hunting party out for us.

580
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:10,119
And I want time
to take one year
of my life out of Lago

581
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,579
before we move on.

582
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:14,415
How long is that
gonna take, you figure?

583
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,543
A lifetime for some of them.

584
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,793
You're out late, Mordecai.
Huh?

585
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,609
...and fornication
and sins of the flesh.

586
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,194
That's what's
going on under my roof

587
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,987
right now
while I'm talking to you.

588
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,365
That stranger has taken over
my whole hotel,

589
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,910
and thrown good,
honest, decent folk
right out into the night.

590
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:36,288
Well, why didn't
you stop him, Lewis?
You've got a gun.

591
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,624
You shut your
fat mouth, Sam.

592
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,210
We're tired
of giving you money
for doing an incompetent job!

593
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,545
Don't you
talk to me that way!

594
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,171
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

595
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,257
Please! Look at us!

596
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,717
Sweet God,
look what's happening to us.

597
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,719
That's right.
It's just like
the preacher says.

598
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,514
That stranger's got
everybody in this town
at each other's throats.

599
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,516
He's set himself up
like a king!

600
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,228
He's got you all
snake fascinated,
every damn one of you!

601
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:03,399
This crazy picnic.
200 gallons
of blood-red paint.

602
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,777
It couldn't be worse
if the devil himself
had ridden right into Lago.

603
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:23,372
Welcome to Lago,
you son of a bitch.

604
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,925
Get out of here!

605
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,227
They're here, Father!

606
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:46,979
I'm sorry.

607
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,213
Morg!

608
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:19,052
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!

609
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:23,015
Morg? Morg, you better
take me with you.

610
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,186
Morg, where are you going?
Morg! Morg!

611
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,104
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!

612
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,315
Get off my cuffs.
Let's go!

613
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,874
Oh, no.

614
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:08,435
Oh, my beautiful hotel.
They promised me
that they wouldn't...

615
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,167
Ruined.

616
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,003
A total loss.

617
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,172
Didn't even touch my store.

618
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:40,092
Look, I want you
to watch that pilfering.

619
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,219
You know, I hold you
responsible, Sheriff.

620
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,805
I'm not
your goddamn sheriff.
You!

621
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,725
Say, I'll need one, two...
Two up there.

622
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,811
I'll need four boxes
from you,

623
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,689
and shovels from you,
so these people
can dig the holes.

624
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:57,150
Well, yes...
But I thought
perhaps we could...

625
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,111
Right now.

626
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,488
Yeah. All right, everyone.

627
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,701
Was you here?
I mean, did you see anything?

628
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,413
Somebody left the door open,
and the wrong dogs came home.

629
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,249
Yeah. Well...

630
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,586
Get the shovel, will you?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

631
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:24,720
I hope
you're not gonna blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity.

632
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:29,308
Because the rest of us here
have an agreement with you.

633
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,728
Well, right now
I don't feel too agreeable.

634
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:37,482
Well, maybe a little bonus
will make you
a little more appreciative.

635
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,485
How little?

636
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,862
500 a head.

637
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:46,074
500 an ear?

638
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,326
Done. Done.

639
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,757
$3,000?

640
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,760
You promised that
son of a bitch $3,000

641
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,386
after what he did
to my hotel?

642
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,348
Promising's one thing.
Paying's another.

643
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,601
He may just catch a bullet.

644
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,566
Oh, you and Lewis
can grab shovels, too.

645
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:25,197
I knew you were cruel,
but I didn't know
how far you could go.

646
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,158
Well, you still don't.

647
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,497
Well, it doesn't
matter to you.

648
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:38,168
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.

649
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,213
All the rooms are ruined
except for our room.

650
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,515
Oh...

651
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,851
Wait. Wait a minute.

652
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,896
Oh, no.

653
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,400
Oh, no. No.

654
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,903
No, let go, let go! Lewis!

655
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,155
Lewis, don't just
stand there.

656
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,366
Let go of me!
Let go!

657
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,662
Stop!
Look, you don't need me.

658
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,998
Let go! Let go!

659
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,294
Let go of me!

660
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,844
What are you
gonna do with those?

661
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,804
Defend myself.

662
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,389
Against what?

663
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,559
It's no secret
what you did
to Callie Travers.

664
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:36,852
Did?

665
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,145
The other day
in the stable.

666
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,109
As I recall,
she enjoyed that quite a bit.

667
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,695
I promise you, I won't.

668
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,365
Well,
you flatter yourself, lady.

669
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,409
I flatter myself?

670
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:58,290
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you,
but a man's got to get
his rest sometime.

671
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,376
Oblige me?

672
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,505
But I'll tell you what.
If you come back
in about a half-hour,

673
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,215
I'll see what
I can do, all right?

674
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,470
Why, you low-down,
stinking, son of a...

675
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,878
Have you ever heard
the name Jim Duncan?

676
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,049
I've heard
a lot of things. Why?

677
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,676
He was town marshal here.

678
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,097
He's lying out there
in an unmarked grave.

679
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:59,518
They say the dead
don't rest without a marker
of some kind.

680
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,063
Do you believe that?

681
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,441
What makes you think I care?

682
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:07,651
I don't know.

683
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,863
He's the reason this town's
afraid of strangers.

684
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:15,742
I was going
to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.

685
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,413
What's funny?

686
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:23,542
You ask me that
in a blown-up hotel

687
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,169
with seven dead men
to your credit already?

688
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,632
I was just stopping by
for a bottle of whiskey

689
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,385
and a nice hot bath.

690
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,888
All right.
If you say so.

691
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,100
You don't believe me?

692
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:47,149
Mister, whatever you say
is fine with me.

693
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,324
Be careful.

694
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,914
You're a man
who makes people afraid,
and that's dangerous.

695
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,668
Well, it's what people know
about themselves inside

696
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,670
that makes them afraid.

697
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,978
I don't know
if we shouldn't mark
the grave somehow.

698
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,229
Sam?

699
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,024
I don't see any need.

700
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:32,319
Ain't likely
that anybody's gonna
cry over them anyhow.

701
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,378
You know what to do.

702
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,671
Yes, sir, Captain.

703
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,759
All right!

704
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,679
Everybody grab
a brush and start in.

705
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,643
You mean, you want
the whole place painted?

706
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,144
Everything.

707
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,980
You can't possibly
mean the church, too.

708
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,857
I mean especially the church.

709
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:16,029
All right, I'll paint
if you say we've got to,

710
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,658
but when we get done,
this place is
gonna look like hell.

711
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,354
Hello, Lewis.

712
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:07,747
I want you to go to that
meeting with me, Sarah.
It's very important.

713
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:08,873
No.

714
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,085
Not now, not ever.

715
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,255
They are still
your neighbors!

716
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:18,550
Yes, they're my neighbors,
and they make me sick.

717
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,387
Hiding behind words
like "faith," "peace,"
and "trust."

718
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,514
Good words.
Damn good words.

719
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,850
But we hid
a murder behind them.

720
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,977
Won't you
never understand, woman?

721
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,021
It wasn't anything
we wanted to do.

722
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,815
When Duncan
found out the mine was
on government property,

723
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,859
it was just
a technicality, really,

724
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,819
but he was determined
to turn us in.

725
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,946
Wouldn't listen to reason.

726
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:44,075
Is that why?
Is that really
why it happened?

727
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:48,413
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have
closed down the mine!

728
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,457
Do you know what would've
happened to this town then?

729
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,084
It would've been the end
of everything
that we've worked on.

730
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,212
All of it, all of us!
And you, too, wife.

731
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:04,179
Now, sometimes
we have to do
what's necessary to do,

732
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,181
for the good of everybody.

733
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,849
That's the price
of progress.

734
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,894
And what's the price
of a human life, Lewis?

735
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,022
Ask your good friends
if they know that.

736
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,190
Uh-huh.

737
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,109
Your damn conscience.

738
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:22,739
I'll say,
it's sure taken a hell
of a while to bother you.

739
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,952
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.

740
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,053
That's Morg Allen,
or what's left of him.

741
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:30,723
Well, now, what's he doing,
riding around here like that?

742
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:34,727
He's come back to pay us
back for some jail time
that was rightfully his.

743
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,729
Only he don't know it yet.

744
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,542
Stacey, help me.

745
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,628
My arm. Help me.

746
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,510
Help me, Stacey.

747
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,307
I'm curious, Morg.

748
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,643
You helped them railroad us,

749
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:19,147
and you've got
the balls to come down here
and ask us for a favor?

750
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,483
Goddamn if
I don't admire you.

751
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,195
Do something
about my arm, Stacey.

752
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,780
Well, I am
doing something, Morg.

753
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,658
Sitting here watching you
bleed to death.

754
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:36,581
Stacey, things have
changed in Lago.

755
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,542
You need me.

756
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,965
I gotta tell you about it.

757
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,010
Yeah. From the looks
of your arm, Morg,

758
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,430
it looks like
you've run your welcome
out in Lago, and ours, too.

759
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,849
What me and the boys
want to know

760
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,352
is how we're gonna
pick up 12 months' back pay

761
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,728
and everything else
that's owed us.

762
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,355
Stacey, for God's sakes!

763
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,273
No, no. For our sake.

764
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,192
Now you can
help us, all right,

765
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,401
and you can
help yourself, too.

766
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,988
Now you just give me
the combination
to that big iron box

767
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:10,365
in the back of your office,

768
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:13,409
and me and the boys
will just

769
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:14,869
Sneak right in there

770
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:17,997
real quiet-like,
take what's ours,
bring you the rest,

771
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,917
or leave it there
safe and sound,
that's up to you.

772
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,546
First, of course,
we'll fix up your arm,

773
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,923
set you over there
in the shade

774
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,342
with a nice canteen
full of water.

775
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:32,804
You no-good,
worthless son of a bitch.

776
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,306
You're probably
right about that.

777
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:41,187
Give me that
combination, Morg.

778
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:44,732
I wouldn't give you
the combination
to the gates of hell.

779
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,451
Ugh! Dog!

780
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:58,705
Sure had a lot
of blood left in him,
didn't he?

781
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:10,174
Two sticks of dynamite
will take care of that
iron box, anyway.

782
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,968
We don't need him.

783
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,154
Dan, you hit?

784
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:32,280
I don't know.

785
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,407
I don't think so.

786
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,868
Damn near tore my leg off!

787
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:43,833
Who the hell is that?

788
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:45,793
Must be Dave Drake.

789
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,382
What the hell did you hit?

790
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,778
Keep shooting, damn it!

791
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,363
He shot my ear off!

792
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:15,657
Somebody up there's
playing games.

793
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,367
He shot my ear off!

794
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:24,248
Well, he could've shot
your whole damn head off!
Now get down!

795
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,212
Dave, is that you?

796
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:37,261
Come on out!
We'll settle this.

797
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:49,232
Morg was almost dead, anyway,
from that arm!

798
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,819
I just put him
out of his misery!

799
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,588
I'll kill you!

800
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,426
You son of a bitch,
I'll kill you!

801
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,098
Come down out of there,
you bastard!
I'll cut your heart out!

802
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:25,351
Let's go up there, Stacey.
There might be
some more dynamite.

803
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:28,730
I'll get him.
I'll get him,
whoever it was up there.

804
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,899
I'll kill every man in Lago!

805
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,235
The guests are on
their way to the party,

806
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,779
so gather
all the people together.

807
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:21,032
Right, Captain!
All right, men,
get that sign up!

808
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,292
Come on!
They're coming!

809
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:46,098
All right,
everybody, come on!
Get a little move on!

810
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,861
I want you
up in that tower.

811
01:25:58,946 --> 01:26:00,822
First sign of dust,
you ring the bell,
you hear?

812
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,907
Are you sure this is
gonna be all right?

813
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,951
It's gonna be all right.

814
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,124
He's back! He's here.
It's time to get ready.

815
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:18,422
What's the matter
with everybody?
Wait till we gun them down.

816
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,424
Bang, bang, bang!

817
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:25,763
All right, everybody, I think
we're expected outside.

818
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:28,850
I just hope
that shooter we hired
is feeling up to snuff.

819
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:31,018
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.

820
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:38,860
Let's go.

821
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,915
Hey, señor,
can we come to the fiesta?

822
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,124
No.

823
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:41,088
I want everybody
to have plenty of those.

824
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:58,356
Hey, ain't it about time
we got out there, huh?

825
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,610
There's plenty of time.

826
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,862
Yeah, but they'll be here
any damn minute.

827
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:07,073
I think Sam's right.
We ought to.

828
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:08,240
Yeah.

829
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,284
What about after?

830
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,704
What about
after we do it?

831
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:14,789
Hmm?

832
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,624
What do we do then?

833
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:20,211
Then you live with it.

834
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:37,311
Where you gonna be?
Are you gonna
take the first shot?

835
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,482
Are you gonna get
Stacey Bridges first?

836
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:44,652
Or maybe you're gonna get
all three by yourself?

837
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,452
When are you
gonna give the signal?

838
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,830
I'm not. You are.

839
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,845
You old people,
move out of here!

840
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,110
Here they come!

841
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:37,908
Yee-haw!

842
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:44,874
Come on!

843
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,500
Fire!

844
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:50,171
Fire! Fire!

845
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:22,786
Get them.

846
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:13,003
Don't shoot me.
Don't! Don't.

847
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,802
A party? A party?

848
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:31,522
Welcome home party, huh?

849
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:39,780
Well, here's to your party.

850
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,375
Give me another bottle.

851
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:56,588
Give me another bottle!

852
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,146
Well, now the party's over.

853
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,480
- Stace!
- Let go of me!

854
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,816
Look what I found
in the bushes.

855
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,111
Look what I found
in the bushes!

856
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:26,577
Stacey, it was always you.

857
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,247
That's why
Morg Allen hated you.

858
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,752
He knew how much
I loved you.

859
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:40,174
Yeah, I bet you just
cried yourself to sleep
every night

860
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:43,761
thinking about me
in that territorial prison.

861
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:48,724
But I did. I really did!

862
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:51,435
Yeah, well,
I can see it all now.

863
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:57,274
You lying there
in Morg Allen's bed,
just a-crying and a-humping.

864
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,777
Oh, no, no!

865
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:01,945
Give me that bottle.

866
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,119
Cole, go and get
the horses ready.

867
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:10,954
You got it, Stace.

868
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,834
Stacey.
Stacey, you're gonna take me
with you, aren't you?

869
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:21,131
I can do better than you
in a four-bit fancy house.

870
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:26,678
You still here?

871
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:28,430
God damn right
I'm still here.

872
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,058
I wanna know
who them sons of bitches
was that ambushed us.

873
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,352
That's what
I'd like to know.

874
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,314
That's what we're gonna
find out right now.

875
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:50,828
Who are you?

876
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,506
Don't hit me.

877
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,263
Don't hit me, please!

878
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:11,432
Please, don't hit me.

879
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,518
Please, stop!

880
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,650
Please, don't hit me!
Please!

881
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:44,214
Come on, Stacey.
Let's get out of here.
Shut up.

882
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,766
Okay, everybody out.

883
01:36:55,602 --> 01:36:57,102
Everybody out!

884
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:58,687
Out!

885
01:36:58,771 --> 01:36:59,771
Come on, move!

886
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:01,398
Go on. Get out!

887
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:03,859
Move!

888
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:09,907
Go on.

889
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:13,785
Move!

890
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:16,997
Hurry up in there. Move!

891
01:37:19,209 --> 01:37:24,880
Move!

892
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:28,217
Hold up there!
Get in there!
Hold it right there!

893
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,690
- Dynamite!
- Dynamite!

894
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,633
Stacey, the goddamn horses
are gone.

895
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,596
Go on. Go on!

896
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:53,528
Help me.

897
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:56,531
Help me.

898
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:50,377
Who are you?

899
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:04,975
Who are you?

900
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:24,739
I'm just about done here.

901
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:29,494
I never did know your name.

902
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:32,247
Yes, you do.

903
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:36,293
Take care.

904
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,337
