And then one day before we actually needed the bastards,

00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,777
they managed to get themselves killed.

162
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,029
So if you've got a suggestion,

163

we'd be delighted to hear it.

00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:42,368
Otherwise, take your
conscience elsewhere while we
think about saving your ass.

165
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,164
Land's sakes.
Where's time gone to, huh?

166
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,959
Miss Peekins' eldest
is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...

167
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,504
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

168
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,139
Well, we were talking about hiring a gunfighter.

169
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,099
Yeah, we don't know anything about that fellow there.

170
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,768
Well, we know he took the best we could find to hire,

171
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,311
like Grant took Vicksburg.

172
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,605
Yeah, with a hidden gun in his lap.

173
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,692
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.

174
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:17,278
Goddamndest shooting I ever even heard of.

175
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,697
I still say we're asking for trouble!

176
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,233
A fellow like that, what do we know about him?

177
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,418
Who is he?
Where does he come from?

178
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,495
Well, you've got our permission to go and ask him.

179
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,121
(LAUGHING)

180
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,459
Although, the last three
that tried that didn't
fare all that well.

181
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,169
CALLIE: Let me out!

182
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,507
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!

183
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,343
Get the hell off me!
Let go of me!

184
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,636
You fat pig!

185
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,305
Hey, come here.
What is this?

186
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,392
I was just down there sounding out that stranger,

187
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,394
when she come in there blasting away like a Cheyenne!

188
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,020
All right, Sam.
All right.

189
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,564
You're planning
to let him get away
with this, aren't you?

190
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,608
Be a little patient,
will you?
Patient?

191
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,236
Callie, when you run
across a man who's used
to having his own way,

192
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,155
you let him have it until he goes too far.

193
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,617
Just what do you consider going too far?

194
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,413
I mean, isn't forcible rape
in broad daylight
a misdemeanor in this town?

195
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,165
There's too much at stake
to throw away
on hysterics now.

196
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,959
Hysterics?

197
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,964
Well, I can remember
some hysterics one night
not too long ago.

198
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,674
Callie, keep your mouth shut!

199
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,883
(SPITS)

200
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,386
Morgan, get her out of here.

201
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,847
I'll see you later.

202
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,598
Yeah.

203
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,560
Not while
that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch

204
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,812
is still breathing, you won't!

205
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,524
You wonder if there's a man left in this town!

206
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:41,320
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!

207
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,199
(PANTING)

208
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,076
Well...

209
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
Why not?

210
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,625
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.

211
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,255
Oh, now, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid. You...

212
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,176
Besides, I have nothing against these men.

213
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,511
Who did you say they are?

214
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,432
Well, Stacey Bridges and his cousins, the Carlin boys,

215
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,642
they worked
for the company. They...

216
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,437
You know, what you call troubleshooters.

217
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,524
You know, just like those three you done in yesterday,

218
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,319
except when
they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.

219
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,653
And they took care of it, too.

220
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,449
Except, well, they got too damn big for their britches.

221
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,912
Started pushing people around,
and taking over the town
and we had to...

222
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,622
Had to what?

223
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,793
Well, we had to take them into custody, that's what.

224
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,672
Yeah.
I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.

225
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:57,271
Hey, you won't be wanting that slab of pie, will you?

226
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,404
You know what happened, friend,

227
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,200
is they stole a golden ingot
out of the mining office
down there,

228
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,369
and they hid it under the floorboard

229
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,538
of the shack that they lived in.

230
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,207
Kind of careless
of them, wasn't it?
Huh?

231
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,461
I mean, does a mining company
usually leave gold ingots
lying around like that?

232
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,713
Well, it does seem a bit peculiar, you know.

233
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,591
Matter of fact,
Stacey kept bringing that up
at the trial all the time,

234
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,469
saying that he was being railroaded with.

235
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,180
And do you know that's why they're mad at us?

236
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,141
No, I'll tell you
what you can do, Sheriff.
What?

237
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,727
When those boys come back to town,

238
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,230
you just clap the bracelets right on them.

239
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,065
Me?
Yeah.

240
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,109
Well, I might have forgot to mention

241
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,779
that they were
all three passed out
at the time, you know?

242
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,448
Look, I'm no lawman.

243
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,701
You know, they just hung this thing on me

244
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,203
when that young Marshal Duncan was killed.

245
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,747
You know,
he was whipped to death
right here in this street.

246
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,709
Bullwhipped.
Damndest thing I ever saw.

247
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,671
Now, why would anybody want to do a thing like that?

248
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,633
Well, I don't know.
It wasn't anybody
from this town, anyhow.

249
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:08,843
How do you know?

250
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,096
Well, this is a good town, and these are good people.

251
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,640
And look, friend, we sure would like it

252
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,684
if you'd help us with our problem.

253
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,689
Only problem
you've got, Sheriff,
is a short supply of guts.

254
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,108
You people don't need me.

255
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,235
Look.

256
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,404
Place a couple of good riflemen

257
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,531
on top of that building up there.

258
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,742
Maybe a couple more with shotguns

259
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,452
down behind grain bags over there.

260
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,622
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there
in the bell tower.

261
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,249
Maybe a rifleman.
That should just
about take care of it.

262
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,878
Well, what would it take to see that through, you know?

263
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,631
The ambush.
What would it cost us?

264
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,051
Sheriff, I don't know
if I really like
this town that much.

265
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,971
Well,
this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.

266
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,058
You like them, you save them.

267
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,271
Look, what if we offered you anything you want?

268
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,862
Anything?

269
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,074
Unlimited credit.
That's what it means.

270
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,577
An open charge account with no reckoning.

271
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,747
What His Honor's trying to say is

272
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,250
you got yourself a free hand in this town, friend.

273
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,002
Any damn thing I want, huh?

274
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,629
Yeah. Go on.
Help yourself.

275
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,423
Help yourself!
Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.

276
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,592
Yes, sir.
Anything you want
that's here,

277
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,969
as best as we can get it for you, we will.

278
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,973
Even if it's some little squaw or a Mex

279
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,434
and keep your bed warm at night.

280
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,228
Hey, you!

281
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,855
Keep your sticky fingers
off them blankets
if you're not buying.

282
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,983
And keep them
kids under control.
Goddamn savages.

283
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,237
And besides, you know, about handling that ambush,

284
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,074
you know, everybody in town,
more or less,
is at your orders.

285
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,428
Here you go.

286
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,473
No, no. No.

287
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,309
Tell him it's all right.

288
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,687
It's all right.

289
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,354
Anything I want?

290
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,447
Now, how's that feel?

291
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,658
Not bad. I'll take them.

292
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,828
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots

293
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,539
and a tooled belt with silver buckle.

294
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,126
Let's see, that'll be, five and two, carry the nine,

295
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,213
and that comes to exactly...

296
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,547
No charge.

297
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,397
Come on, now.

298
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,320
I'd like to get all these people a drink.

299
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,324
Yes, sir.
One round for the house.
There you are.

300
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,662
This gentleman here's buying a round for the house.

301
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,707
No fair. No fair.
I ordered one, too. Don't I
get a glass of beer?

302
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,835
You get a glass of beer,
right there.
Coming up.

303
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,174
There we are.

304
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:03,888
Now, that's one round
for the house, sir.
Anything else?

305
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,222
Get yourself something.

306
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,642
Oh, thank you
very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.

307
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,563
And smoke it later.

308
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:18,694
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8.50.

309
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,363
There's no charge, Lutie.
(CHUCKLES)

310
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,489
Huh?

311
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,660
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants
in this town, he gets.

312
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,912
You voted on it.

313
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,289
I didn't know that meant free whiskey.

314
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,834
Well, everybody's
got to put something
in the kitty, right?

315
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,669
(ALL LAUGHING)

316
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,796
Right.

317
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,763
About time this town had a new sheriff.

318

No, that one.

eat my own horse!

That slop he fed us wasn't our horses.

He just stole them and sold them to somebody.

Some kind of a picnic.

dead drunk in Nogales,
we'll know in 24 hours.

You're not getting your fair share of the profits?

It's not the profits.

509
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,230
It's just that this whole business has gone sour

was hiring that man Duncan
in the first place,

514
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,784
and you did that
all by yourself.

01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,545
Don't you talk to me that way!

636
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,171
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

637
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,257
Please! Look at us!

638
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,717
Sweet God, look what's happening to us.

639
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,719
That's right.
It's just like
the preacher says.

640
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,514
That stranger's got
everybody in this town
at each other's throats.

641
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,516
He's set himself up like a king!

642
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,228
He's got you all
snake fascinated,
every damn one of you!

643
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:03,399
This crazy picnic.
200 gallons
of blood-red paint.

644
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,777
It couldn't be worse
if the devil himself
had ridden right into Lago.

(FLOORBOARDS CREAKING)

646
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:23,372
Welcome to Lago, you son of a bitch.

647
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,925
Get out of here!

648
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,227
They're here, Father!

649
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:46,979
I'm sorry.

01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,213
Morg!

652
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:19,052
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!

653
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:23,015
Morg? Morg, you better
take me with you.

654
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,186
Morg, where are you going?
Morg! Morg!

655
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,104
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!

656
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,315
Get off my cuffs.
Let's go!

LEWIS: Oh, no.

658
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:08,435
Oh, my beautiful hotel.
They promised me
that they wouldn't...

659
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,167
Ruined.

660
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,003
A total loss.

661
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,172
Didn't even touch my store.

662
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:40,092
Look, I want you to watch that pilfering.

663
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,219
You know, I hold you responsible, Sheriff.

664
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,805
I'm not
your goddamn sheriff.
You!

665
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,725
Say, I'll need one, two...
Two up there.

666
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,811
I'll need four boxes from you,

667
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,689
and shovels from you, so these people can dig the holes.

668
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:57,150
Well, yes...
But I thought
perhaps we could...

669
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,111
Right now.

670
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,488
Yeah. All right, everyone.

671
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,701
Was you here?
I mean, did you see anything?

672
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,413
Somebody left the door open,
and the wrong dogs came home.

673
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,249
Yeah. Well...

674
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,586
Get the shovel, will you?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

675
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:24,720
I hope
you're not gonna blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity.

676
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:29,308
Because the rest of us here have an agreement with you.

677
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,728
Well, right now I don't feel too agreeable.

678
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:37,482
Well, maybe a little bonus
will make you
a little more appreciative.

679
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,485
How little?

680
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,862
500 a head.

681
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:46,074
500 an ear?

682
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,326
Done. Done.

$3,000?

685
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,760
You promised that son of a bitch $3,000

686
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,386
after what he did to my hotel?

687
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,348
Promising's one thing.
Paying's another.

688
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,601
He may just catch a bullet.

689
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,566
Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels, too.

690
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:25,197
I knew you were cruel,
but I didn't know
how far you could go.

691
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,158
Well, you still don't.

692
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,497
Well, it doesn't matter to you.

693
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:38,168
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.

694
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,213
All the rooms are ruined except for our room.

695
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,515
Oh...

696
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,851
Wait. Wait a minute.

697
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,896
Oh, no.

698
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,400
Oh, no. No.

699
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,903
No, let go, let go! Lewis!

700
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,155
Lewis, don't just stand there.

701
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,366
Let go of me!
Let go!

702
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,662
Stop!
Look, you don't need me.

703
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,998
Let go! Let go!

704
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,294
Let go of me!

705
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,844
What are you gonna do with those?

706
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,804
Defend myself.

707
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,389
Against what?

708
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,559
It's no secret what you did to Callie Travers.

709
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:36,852
Did?

710
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,145
The other day in the stable.

711
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,109
As I recall, she enjoyed that quite a bit.

712
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,695
I promise you, I won't.

713
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,365
Well, you flatter yourself, lady.

714
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,409
I flatter myself?

715
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:58,290
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you,
but a man's got to get
his rest sometime.

716
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,376
Oblige me?

717
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,505
But I'll tell you what.
If you come back
in about a half-hour,

718
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,215
I'll see what I can do, all right?

719
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,470
Why, you low-down,
stinking, son of a...

(GRUNTS)

721
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,878
Have you ever heard the name Jim Duncan?

722
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,049
I've heard
a lot of things. Why?

723
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,676
He was town marshal here.

724
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,097
He's lying out there in an unmarked grave.

725
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:59,518
They say the dead
don't rest without a marker
of some kind.

726
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:03,063
Do you believe that?

727
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,441
What makes you think I care?

728
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:07,651
I don't know.

729
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,863
He's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.

730
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:15,742
I was going
to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.

731
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,413
What's funny?

732
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:23,542
You ask me that
in a blown-up hotel

733
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,169
with seven dead men to your credit already?

734
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,632
I was just stopping by for a bottle of whiskey

735
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,385
and a nice hot bath.

736
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,888
All right.
If you say so.

737
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,100
You don't believe me?

738
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:47,149
Mister, whatever you say is fine with me.

739
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,324
Be careful.

740
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,914
You're a man
who makes people afraid,
and that's dangerous.

741
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,668
Well, it's what people know about themselves inside

742
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,670
that makes them afraid.

743
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,978
I don't know if we shouldn't mark the grave somehow.

744
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,229
Sam?

745
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,024
I don't see any need.

746
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:32,319
Ain't likely that anybody's gonna cry over them anyhow.

747
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,378
You know what to do.

748
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,671
Yes, sir, Captain.

749
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,759
All right!

750
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,679
Everybody grab a brush and start in.

751
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,643
You mean, you want the whole place painted?

752
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,144
Everything.

753
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,980
You can't possibly mean the church, too.

754
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,857
I mean especially the church.

755
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:16,029
All right, I'll paint if you say we've got to,

756
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,658
but when we get done,
this place is
gonna look like hell.

757
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,354
Hello, Lewis.

758
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:07,747
I want you to go to that
meeting with me, Sarah.
It's very important.

759
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:08,873
No.

760
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,085
Not now, not ever.

761
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,255
They are still your neighbors!

762
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:18,550
Yes, they're my neighbors, and they make me sick.

763
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,387
Hiding behind words
like "faith," "peace,"
and "trust."

764
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,514
Good words.
Damn good words.

765
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,850
But we hid a murder behind them.

766
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,977
Won't you never understand, woman?

767
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,021
It wasn't anything we wanted to do.

768
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,815
When Duncan
found out the mine was
on government property,

769
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,859
it was just a technicality, really,

770
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,819
but he was determined to turn us in.

771
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,946
Wouldn't listen to reason.

772
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:44,075
Is that why?
Is that really
why it happened?

773
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:48,413
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have
closed down the mine!

774
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,457
Do you know what would've happened to this town then?

775
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,084
It would've been the end
of everything
that we've worked on.

776
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,212
All of it, all of us!
And you, too, wife.

777
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:04,179
Now, sometimes we have to do what's necessary to do,

778
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,181
for the good of everybody.

779
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,849
That's the price of progress.

780
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,894
And what's the price of a human life, Lewis?

781
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,022
Ask your good friends if they know that.

782
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,190
Uh-huh.

783
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,109
Your damn conscience.

784
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:22,739
I'll say,
it's sure taken a hell
of a while to bother you.

785
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,952
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.

786
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,053
COLE: That's Morg Allen,
or what's left of him.

787
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:30,723
Well, now, what's he doing, riding around here like that?

788
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:34,727
He's come back to pay us
back for some jail time
that was rightfully his.

789
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,729
Only he don't know it yet.

790
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,542
Stacey, help me.

791
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,628
My arm. Help me.

792
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,510
Help me, Stacey.

I'm curious, Morg.

794
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,643
You helped them railroad us,

795
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:19,147
and you've got
the balls to come down here
and ask us for a favor?

You need me.

802

I gotta tell you about it.

803
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,010
Yeah. From the looks
of your arm, Morg,

804
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,430
it looks like
you've run your welcome
out in Lago, and ours, too.

What me and the boys want to know

806
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,352
is how we're gonna pick up 12 months' back pay

No, no. For our sake.

810

811
