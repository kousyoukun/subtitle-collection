1
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,871
打起精神来　泰德
Pull yourself together Teddy!

2
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,498
镇定
Pull yourself together!

3
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:23,311
只是水而已
It's just water.

4
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,196
很多的水
It's a lot of water.

5
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:34,473
振作点
Come on.

6
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:02,935
-你没事吧　老大　 -我没事
- You okay boss? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't

7
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:06,628
我只是晕船
I just can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:12,424
-你是我的新搭档?　 -没错
- So you're my new partner? - That's right.

9
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:15,965
我刚才在厕所里吐完一轮 真不是见面的好时机啊
Not the best way to meet with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:19,758
你和我听说的泰德　丹尼尔的传说不一样
Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels: The man. The legend. I'll give you that.

11
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,776
传说?
The Legend?

12
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,061
你们在波特兰又乱编了什么传奇?
What the hell are you boys smoking out there in Portland anyway?

13
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:24,714
是西雅图
Seattle.

14
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,855
我来自西雅图分部的
I came from the office in Seattle.

15
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:32,198
你做联邦警察多长时间了
How long have you been with Marshals?

16
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,217
4年
Four years.

17
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:38,193
那你知道这官有多么小
- So you know how small it is? - Sure

18
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:43,696
你呢　有女友吗　结婚了吗
What about you? You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:45,053
我曾有
I was.

20
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:58,308
她死了
She died.

21
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:03,237
-对不起　我不知道...　 -没事
- Jesus... I didn't... - Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,378
我们家的公寓楼失火了　当时我在工作
There was a fire at the apartment building while I was at work

23
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,919
死了四个人
Four People died.

24
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:12,595
她不是被烧死的而是被浓烟熏死的
It was the smoke that got her not the fire. So...

25
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:15,015
-这一点很重要　 -真不幸
- So that's important. - I'm sorry Boss.

26
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:17,521
我的烟呢?
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:20,524
来抽我的吧
Well here. Have one of mine.

28
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:23,987
我记得是放在我的外套里了
I could of sworn they were in my jacket when I got on.

29
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:27,041
为政府工作就是没有什么油水
Government employees will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:29,653
谢谢
Thanks.

31
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,920
你来以前知道这个机构的情况吗
They give you a briefing about the institution before you left?

32
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:37,259
我只知道这是家精神病院
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,222
里头关着精神病罪犯
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,059
如果只是有幻觉的
Well, if it was just folks running around, hearing voices,

35
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,937
或者疯疯癫癫的精神病　就不用我们出马了
and chasing after butterflies, they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:59,001
我们就到那里?　对
- That's where we're headed? - Yup.

37
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,547
岛的四面是悬崖
The other side of the island is rock bluffs

38
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:03,504
悬崖下面紧靠着海
all the way down to the edge of the water.

39
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:07,760
码头是进出唯一的路
The dock, it's the only way on...or off.

40
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:11,646
你们一上岸我们就开船离开
We will be casting off as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:14,233
希望你们能动作快点
I'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,451
-为什么　 -暴风雨要来了
- Why? - Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:47,088
我从没见过联邦警察的徽章
I've never seen a marshal's badge before.

44
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,830
我是副典狱长麦克弗森,你们好
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson, gentlemen.

45
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:55,518
欢迎来到隔离岛　 我带你们去管理中心
Welcome to Shutter Island. I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.

46
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,444
你的手下好像如临大敌似的紧张的很
Your boys seem a little on edge Mr. McPherson.

47
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:12,158
现在这情况下　我们都这样
Right now, Marshal. We all are.

48
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:34,146
记住我们也曾活过　爱过　笑过
"Remember us for we too have lived, loved and laughed"

49
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:57,646
篱笆都通了电
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:00,958
你怎么看出来的
How could you tell?

51
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,392
我以前见过这种装置
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:36,789
好了　我们会给予你们尽可能的帮助
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded all the help we can give.

53
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,546
但是在岛上期间　你们要遵守规定　明白吗
But during the stay you will obey protocol. Is that understood?

54
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:42,513
当然
Absolutely.

55
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,888
右边的红砖建筑是A栋病房　男性病房
The red brick bulding on my right is ward A, the male ward.

56
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,893
B栋病房是女性病房　就是左边这栋
Ward B, the female ward, is the one on the left.

57
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:53,258
C栋病房是悬崖上的这栋建筑
Ward C is that building on the bluffs. An old civil war fort.

58
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,530
里面是最危险的病人
The most dangerous patients are housed there.

59
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:01,828
要进入C栋病房　必须有书面批准
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without the written consent and

60
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,708
以及我本人和考利医生的陪同
physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly.

61
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,404
明白吗
Is that understood?

62
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,577
看来你也被精神病传染了
You act like insanity is catching.

63
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:17,511
你们要交出武器
You are hereby required to surrending your firearms.

64
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,234
麦克弗森先生　我们都是正式任命的联邦警察
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed federal marshals.

65
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,738
我们必须随时带着武器
We are required to carry our firearms with us at all times.

66
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:26,783
关于监狱的联邦法令319条规定
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries states that:

67
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:28,954
在监狱内部
when inside the penitentiary

68
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:33,937
监狱长拥有最高权威
the offices of that institution have final authority.

69
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:42,179
先生们　你们交出武器才能进这个门
Gentlemen, you will not get through this gate with your firearms.

70
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:02,005
例行程序就到这里　来吧
Okay. Now that the official stuff is done, come on boys.

71
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:05,502
我们去找考利医生吧
What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

72
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,907
她是怎么逃走的　那个犯人?
So when did she escape? This prisoner?

73
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:22,037
这些情况考利医生会向你介绍
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to fill you in on the situation.

74
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:22,847
这是规定
Protocol.

75
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:25,458
精神病院里也有狱警
Correctional officers at a mental institution.

76
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,868
看起来挺奇怪啊
That's a weird sight, if you don't mind me saying

77
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,091
这在美国是独一无二的
It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S. Even in the world.

78
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,847
在世界上也是　我们只收留最危险的精神病人
We take only the most dangerous, damaged patients.

79
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,811
都是别的精神病院管不了的　这都多亏了考利医生
Ones no other hospital can manage. And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

80
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:43,865
他创立了独特的管理方武
He's created something really unique here. It's a hospital for people our society normally...

81
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,951
身份验证　先生们
ID's, gentlemen.

82
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,481
请出示警徽
Show your badges, gentlemen.

83
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:21,087
考利医生接受过多次咨询
Dr. Cawley's been consulted numerous times

84
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:25,137
伦敦警察厅　军情五处　战略情报局　为什么
- By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS... - Why?

85
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,937
你什么意思
What do you mean?

86
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,982
情报机构为什么要咨询精神病学家?
What do intelligence agencies want to consult a psychatrist about?

87
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:35,799
这你要问他了
I guess you'll have to ask him.

88
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,379
丹尼尔联邦警察　医生
- Marshal Daniels. - Doctor.

89
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,631
我是奥尔联邦警察
Marshal Aule.

90
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:53,722
谢谢你副典狱长　可以了　是
- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all. - Yes, sir.

91
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,445
很荣幸先生们
Pleasure, gentlemen.

92
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:58,354
他提到你很多次
He had a lot to say about you.

93
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:01,484
麦克弗森是个好人　他相信我们在这里的工作
McPherson is a good man. He believes in the work we do here.

94
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:03,947
那么到底是什么工作
And what would that be exactly?

95
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:07,536
法律、秩序和医疗的结合
A moral fusion between law and order and clinical care.

96
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:11,657
什么和什么
Pardon me Doc... a what between what and what?

97
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,478
这些画画得很准确
Those paintings are quite accurate.

98
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,477
这就是我们以前对付的那种病人
It used to be that the kind of patients we deal with here

99
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:26,189
戴上镰铐　不管不问
were shackled and left in their own filth.

100
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,426
经常被打得浑身是血
They were beaten. As if whipping them bloody would drive the psychosis out.

101
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:36,331
把螺丝钉钉入其头部　按到水里直至昏迷
We drove screws into their brains. We submerged them in icy water until they lost consciousness.

102
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,635
甚至淹死
Or even drown.

103
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,379
现在呢?　我们治疗他们
- And now? - We treat them.

104
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,570
尽量让他们治愈
Try to heal, try to cure.

105
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:47,556
即使不奏效　也会给他们的生活带来信心　带来心情的平静
And if this fails, at least we provide them with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.

106
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:48,654
这里的都是...
These are...

107
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,938
暴力罪犯吧
all violent offenders, right?

108
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,765
伤害过人
They've hurt people.

109
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:58,114
甚至有的杀过人　基本都是杀过人的
- Murdered them in some cases. - In almost all cases. Yes.

110
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:03,873
我个人看来这种人就不用给他们平静感了
Then personally Doctor, I'd have to say... screw their sense of calm.

111
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:07,796
我职责是治疗病人 不是治疗受害人 我对他们没有偏见
It's my job to treat my patients not their victims. I'm not here to judge.

112
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:11,240
那么女性犯人中...　病人
- So this female prisoner... - Patient.

113
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:14,881
对不起　女性病人中瑞秋索兰多
Excuse me, patient. One Rachel Solando,

114
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,772
昨晚刚逃走了　
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

115
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,833
10点到12点之间
Last night, between 10 and midnight.

116
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,197
她可说是个很危险的人　
- Is she considered dangerous? - You could say that.

117
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:26,700
她杀了她的三个孩子
She killed all three of her children.

118
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,831
在她家后面的湖里淹死了他们
She drowned them in the lake behind her house.

119
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:33,252
把他们一个一个的按进水中　直到淹死
She took them out one by one and held their heads under until they died.

120
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:36,842
然后再把他们抱回到餐桌旁
Then she brought them back inside and arranged them around the kitchen table.

121
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:40,885
邻居来拜访的时候　她正在吃饭呢
She ate a meal there before a neighbor dropped by.

122
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,767
她丈夫呢
And what about the husband?

123
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:47,359
死于诺曼底登陆　她是战争遗族
He died. On the beaches of Normandy. She is a war widow.

124
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,609
刚来的时候绝食 坚持说孩子没有死
She starved herself when first she came here. She insisted the children weren't dead.

125
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,889
对不起　医生　你有阿司匹林吗　 头疼吗　警官?
- Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you? - Prone to headaches marshal.

126
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,767
有时会 不过今天
Sometimes, but today...

127
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:11,980
是因为晕船　啊　脱水了
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness. - Ah, Dehydration...

128
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,649
没事吧老大　没事
- You alright boss? - Yes.

129
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,779
对付这种情况　越简单的办法越好
In that case you're quite right. The simpler the better.

130
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,372
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

131
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:22,759
瑞秋仍然相信孩子还活着
Rachel still believes her children are alive.

132
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:27,343
她还认为这里就是她在伯克郡的家
She also believes this place is her home in the Berckshires.

133
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,673
不会吧
You're kidding me.

134
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:31,844
在这家精神病院的四年中
She's never once in two years acknowledged that she is in an institution.

135
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,264
她认为我们都是...
She believes we're all...

136
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:35,767
送货员　快递小弟　邮差
deliveryman, milkman, postal workers.

137
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:40,399
为了保持孩子还活着的错觉 她还创造了复杂的虚构场景
To sustain the illusion that her children never died, she's created an elaborate fictional structure.

138
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,573
我们都成了她虚构场景的角色
She gives us all parts to play in that fiction.

139
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:49,162
你们搜查过了吗　典狱长带人搜遍了岛上
- So have you searched the grounds yet? - The warden and his men scoured the island,

140
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:50,312
没有线索
not a trace.

141
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:56,007
更令人不安的是　我们不知道她是怎么离开房间的
What's more disturbing is, we don't know how she got out of her room.

142
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,386
房间是由外面锁上的
It was locked from the outside

143
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:01,100
唯一的窗户也有铁栅栏
and the only window is barred.

144
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:07,693
好像她穿过墙蒸发了
It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls.

145
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:16,039
在群体治疗后把她带回来　锁在房间里
Brought her right back here after group therapy, locked her in

146
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,448
午夜查房的时候　就发现她不见了
I came back for a midnight round and she was gone.

147
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:30,019
说真的　医生　她怎么会一直没有发现事实呢
Seriously doctor, how is it possible that the truth never gets through to her?

148
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,066
没发现自己是个精神病?
I mean, she's in a mental institution, right?

149
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,152
她总该发现有哪里不正常
Seems like something you'd notice from time to time.

150
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:38,783
-每个病人都有几双鞋?　 -两双
- How many pairs of shoes are the patients given? - Two pairs.

151
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,010
不是人人都可以神智健全的
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,

152
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:43,790
不能想克服就克服
You can't just choose to get over it.

153
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,374
那么　她光着脚走了?
So... she left here barefoot?

154
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:51,969
外面地形崎岖　光着脚走不了多远
Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten yards in that terrain.

155
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,778
警官?!
Marshal?

156
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,253
这肯定是瑞秋的笔迹
Well this is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

157
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:18,887
-我不知道第四条定律是什么意思 -不是精神病学术语?
- I have no idea what the "law of 4" is, though. - It's not a psychiatric term?

158
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,138
应该不是
I'm afraid not.

159
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,052
谁是67号？
Who's 67?

160
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,060
我不知道
Fuck if I know!

161
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,400
我觉得还是临床病理派 比较会解释
I'd have to say that's quite close to my clinical conclusion.

162
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,903
那么你觉得这只是随便乱写的?
So you think it's random scribblings?

163
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:33,868
不是的　瑞秋很聪明　非常聪明
Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart. Brilliant in fact.

164
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:36,997
-这张纸可能很重要　 -对不起　医生
- This paper could be important. - Excuse me Doctor, but...

165
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:40,676
-我们要留着它　 -那当然
- We're gonna have to hold onto this. - Of course.

166
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,509
逃走的话必须经过这里
And you say she had to come through here.

167
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,557
熄灯后　勤务人员就在这里打牌打整夜
After lights out, the orderlies play cards in here.

168
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:53,773
昨晚有7个人坐在楼梯下面玩牌
Last night there were 7 men sitting at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.

169
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:57,571
但是瑞秋却从他们身边溜过去了
Yet somehow, Rachel managed to slip past them.

170
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:57,989
为什么
Why?

171
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,751
怎么溜过去的? 隐形了?
How? She turns invisible?

172
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:05,458
医生　我们需要所有医务人员的个人档案
Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files of all the medical staff.

173
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,378
还有护士　警卫和勤务人员
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies.

174
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,884
在这里工作的所有人　 我们会考虑你所提的申请
- Anyone who was working then. - We'll take your request under consideration.

175
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:13,598
这不是申请，医生
This is not a request, Doctor.

176
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:16,477
这是联邦机构 如今一位危险的犯人...
This is a federal facility and a dangerous prisoner...

177
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:18,511
病患　病患
- Patient. - Patient...

178
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:23,320
已经逃走了 你必须照我说的, 否则.. 我只能说，我会尽量帮忙
- has escaped now. You will comply... - All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

179
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:28,745
医生　我们需要和工作人员谈一谈　你明白吗？
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff, do you understand?

180
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:32,000
我会在饭后让他们到休息室集合
I'll assemble them in the common room after dinner.

181
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:39,461
如果你还有别的问题　可以加入副典狱长的搜索行动
If you have any further questions feel free to join the deputy warden in the search.

182
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:52,448
离这岛最近的陆地也有11英里　水又这么冷
It's 11 miles to the nearest land and the water is freezing.

183
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:55,661
昨晚浪很大
The current was strong last night. The tide pushing in.

184
00:15:55,662 --> 00:16:03,382
她会淹死　或者被浪冲到岩石上撞死 尸体会冲到海岸上
She'd have drowned or been crushed on the rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore.

185
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:06,638
搜查过那边的山洞了吗
What about those caves down there, have you checked them?

186
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,116
她不可能在里面
No way she could get there.

187
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,398
悬崖下面都是毒藤　槲树、漆树
The base of those cliffs are covered in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

188
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,946
很多植物的荆棘比我的手指还要长
and a thousand plants with thorns as big as my dick.

189
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:21,432
你也看到了　她连个鞋子都没有.
You said it yourself marshal, she's got no shoes.

190
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,461
好了我们去找另一边
All right! Let's check the other side!

191
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:37,010
那栋是什么? 以前是个灯塔
- What's that tower? - It's an old lighthouse.

192
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,603
警卫已经找过那了
The guards already searched inside it.

193
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:46,450
里面有什么? 关别的病人?　 -污水处理设施
- What's in there? More patients? - Sewage treatment facility.

194
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,407
快天黑了
It's getting dark soon.

195
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:50,624
今天就到这里吧
I'm calling this off for the night.

196
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,058
我们走吧
Let's go, boys!

197
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,594
当时是你执勤?　对
- You were on watch on the landing, huh? - Yeah.

198
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:03,477
有人经过走廊 我不可能看不见
Can't nobody get in or out of their room in that corridor without me seeing.

199
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:05,355
好的 瑞秋索兰多
Okay, Rachel Solando,

200
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:09,738
她要到这里 还需要经过谁
who else does she have to pass to get down here?

201
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:14,667
我
Me.

202
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:16,936
格兰米亚
Glen Miga.

203
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:22,339
长官　我什么都没看见　 你一晚上都没离开?
- Sir, I didn't see nothing. - And you were at your post all night?

204
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,453
是的　但我什么都没看见
Yes. But I didn't see a thing.

205
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:27,606
格兰
Glen.

206
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:30,592
格兰
Glen.

207
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,194
对我说实话
Tell me the truth.

208
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:42,287
我可能去过一趟洗手间
I maybe... went to the bathroom.

209
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:48,004
什么? 你违反了规则? 天啊　我只离开了一分钟吧
- What? You breached protocol? Christ... - I wasn't gone more than a minute.

210
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:50,842
我们再回顾一遍
All right, let's back up here. Let's all just back up.

211
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:54,390
熄灯之前把瑞秋 带回房间
Miss Solando was put in her room for lights out.

212
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,518
谁知道她回到房间之前还做了什么
Does anybody here know  what she did before that?

213
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,172
谁知道
Anyone?

214
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:02,685
有没有人知道
Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.

215
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,358
她参加了群体治疗
She was in a group therapy session.

216
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,493
那他有没有什么异常?
Huh. Did anything unusual occur?

217
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:11,188
异常怎么定义？
Define "unusual".

218
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:15,255
你说什么　这可是精神病院　警官?!
- Excuse me. - It's a mental institution, marshal.

219
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:17,187
这里关着一群精神病罪犯
For criminally insane.

220
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:20,760
所谓的正常反而很难碰到
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.

221
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,768
那我换个说法
I will rephrase.

222
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,149
在昨天晚上的群体治疗期间
Did anything happen last night during group therapy, that was more...

223
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,278
有没有比平时更...　引人注意的?
- let's say, more memorable than... - Normal?

224
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,010
没错
Exactly!

225
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,223
没有　对不起
No. I'm sorry.

226
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:38,500
群体治疗的时候　瑞秋说过什么吗
Did Mrs. Solando say anything during group therapy?

227
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:41,291
她担心暴风雨
She was worried about the rain.

228
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:43,842
还讨厌这里的伙食
And she hated the food here.

229
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:47,599
经常抱怨　昨晚也是
Complained constantly. Last night included.

230
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:51,979
当时有没有医生在场?
So... you were there. Was there a doctor present?

231
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,198
是的　希恩医生主持
Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

232
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:56,832
希恩医生?
Dr. Sheehan?

233
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,110
是的　他主持的治疗
Yes. He was running the session.

234
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:03,664
他是瑞秋的主治医生
He's Rachels's "primary".

235
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:07,995
直接负责她的治疗
The psychaiatrist who directly oversees her care.

236
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:11,092
我们需要和希恩医生谈谈
We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

237
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,681
这是不可能的
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

238
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:17,060
他今早坐船离开码头了　他的休假早已安排好了
He left on the ferry this morning. His vacation was already planned.

239
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,980
结果一直被延后放不了假
He'd putting it off too long.

240
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:21,401
你们这是一级管制区
You're in a state of lockdown.

241
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:24,030
一个危险的病人逃走了
A dangerous patient has escaped

242
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,465
你们却让他的主治医生休假去了?
and you let her primary doctor leave on vacation?

243
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:30,739
那当然，他又不是病人
Of course, he's a doctor.

244
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,927
你有他的联络电话吗？
Do you have the phone number for where he's gone?

245
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,103
喂　喂
Hello? Hello?

246
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:43,468
喂
Hello?

247
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:46,149
有人在吗
Is anybody there?

248
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,569
对不起　长官　所有线路都不通
I'm sorry sir, but its all down. All the lines.

249
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,239
线路大概都被暴风雨破坏了
The storm's hitting the mainland like a hammer.

250
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,038
如果能接通　立刻告诉我　 警官 有很重要的电话要打
If you get it working, come find me immediately. The marshalls need to make an important call.

251
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:56,900
是
Yes, sir.

252
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:06,554
我晚上还要到病房巡视
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,

253
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:09,554
不过9点左右　我会在家里喝酒抽烟
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at my house around 9

254
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,479
你可以来玩
If you'd care to drop by

255
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,193
好　到那时就可以谈了吧
Good, we can talk then, right?

256
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,810
我们一直在谈　警官
We have been talking, marshal.

257
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,229
这里真不像精神病院应有的设施
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got into the wrong line of public service.

258
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,317
确实有点太过豪华　这是内战时盖的
It is a little overwhelming. it was constructed during the Civil War

259
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:45,805
军事堡垒也是同时盖好的　也就是现在的C栋病房
The same time as the military fort housing ward C.

260
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:56,341
这里曾经是指挥总部　花了美国政府一大笔钱
This is the original commander's quarters. When Uncle Sam got the bill

261
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,052
盖好不久，指挥官就被送上军事法庭
the commander was court-martialed.

262
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,331
看得出来..
I can see why.

263
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:03,097
音乐不错　勃拉姆斯的曲子?
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

264
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:03,984
不是
No.

265
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,307
是马勒的作品
It's Mahler.

266
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:17,050
正确,警官
Quite right, marshal.

267
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:22,737
对不起　先生们　这是我的同事杰里米纳林医生
Forgive me, gentlemen... My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

268
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:32,857
钢琴乐与弦乐四重奏A小调
"Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor"

269
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,240
你们喝什么　裸麦威士忌　如果有的话
- Your poison, gentlemen? - Rye, if you've got it.

270
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:41,667
冰镇汽水　谢谢
Soda and ice please, thanks.

271
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:44,333
你不喜欢喝酒?
You don't indulge in alcohol?

272
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,715
真是没想到
I am surprised.

273
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:50,717
你这种职业的人不都是挺能喝吗
Isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe?

274
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:53,014
差不多　你这种职业的人呢
Common enough. And yours?

275
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:59,690
你说什么？　你的职业―精神科医生
- I'm sorry? - Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry...

276
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:03,529
我听说精神科医生都是一群酒鬼
I've always heard it was overrun with boozers and drunks.

277
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,565
我倒是没发现
Not that I've noticed.

278
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,207
难道你喝的是红茶吗
What's that? Iced tea in your glass there?

279
00:22:10,244 --> 00:22:11,850
好样的　警官
Excellent marshal.

280
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:15,089
你很擅于自我防卫
You have outstanding defense mechanisms.

281
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,715
你肯定很擅长拷问
You must be quite adept at interrogations, hmm?

282
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:30,264
你们这样的人　就是我的研究对像
Men like you... are my specialty. You know?

283
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:32,742
暴力之人
Men of violence.

284
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:36,164
这假设有点问题
That's a hell of an assumption to make...

285
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:41,379
不是假设　你误会了　我说你们是暴力的人
No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand me, I said you are men of violence

286
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,763
不是说你们是使用暴力的人　这大不一样
I'm not accusing you of being violent men. That's quite different.

287
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,423
请讲解一下吧　医生
Please, please, edify us, doctor.

288
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:53,117
你们都曾在海外服役
You both served overseas.

289
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:58,198
时间不长　医生　我们在国外不是作文职工作
Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know, we were both paper pushers over there

290
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,790
嗯 你们不是
No, you were not.

291
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:21,776
我肯定你们从毕业后 就一直再打仗
Since the schoolyard, neither of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.

292
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:27,201
并不是说你们喜欢打仗 只是因为你们没法接受撤
Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat wasn't something you considered an option.

293
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:29,445
政府养我们不是为了逃跑的
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

294
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:31,663
是啊　养你们
Ah, yes... Raised.

295
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:36,800
谁养了你　警官？
and who raised you, marshal?

296
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:37,140
我吗?
Me?

297
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:40,166
狼
Wolves.

298
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:47,359
厉害的自我防卫
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

299
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,153
你相信上帝吗? 警官
Do you believe in God, marshal?

300
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:55,804
我是认真的
I'm quite serious.

301
00:24:58,262 --> 00:24:59,644
你这是废话
That's rubbish.

302
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,768
你见过纳粹集中营吗
Have you ever seen... a death camp, doctor?

303
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,136
我在解放达豪集中营的时候见过
[In German] I have, I was there, for the liberation of Dakau.

304
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:19,410
你的英语说得很好
Your English is very good, almost flawless.

305
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:25,636
说得很好　不过辅音发的有点重
His English is very good. You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.

306
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:26,943
你是德国人?
You're German?

307
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:35,685
合法移民也是犯罪吗,警官? 　 我不知道　你最清楚
- Is legal immigration a crime, marshal? - Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.

308
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:40,828
听着我们需要希恩医生的档案　还有其它员工的
Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan and the rest of staff as well.

309
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:43,790
员工的档案是绝对不会给你的　 -免谈
No personnel files will be released for you. Period.

310
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:47,044
我们需要档案　 -办不到
- We're gonna need those files. - Out of the question.

311
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,050
什么不可能　胡扯
Bullshit, out of the question! Bullshit!

312
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,637
这里谁说了算
Who the hell is in charge here anyway, huh?

313
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:56,601
纳林医生是我们海外董事会的联络人
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to our board of overseers.

314
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:58,772
他已提交你的请求　但被拒绝了
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

315
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:02,152
拒绝? 他们无权拒绝　你也没有
Refused? They don't have the authority to refuse. And neither do you, sir.

316
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:05,908
警官先生　请继续你的调查　我们会尽全力协助
Marshal, continue your investigation and we will do all we can to help.

317
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,869
调查结束了!
This investigation is over.

318
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,352
我们要把调查报告交给...
We're gonna file our reports and hand it over to...

319
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:13,191
-联邦调查局　 -联邦调查局　没错!
- Hoover's boys. - Hoover's boys, that's right.

320
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:15,277
我们明早就搭船走
We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning.

321
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:16,582
走吧　查克
Come on, Chuck.

322
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:26,519
夜色不错
Nice night.

323
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:36,561
你们在勤务人员区住宿
You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter.

324
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:51,345
老大　我们真的要停止调查?
Hey boss?... We really packing it in?

325
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:52,712
为什么
Why?

326
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:58,887
我以前从没有中途放弃过
I guess, I dunno, I just... never really quit anything before.

327
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:02,516
我们到现在没听到一句实话　查克
We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck.

328
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:08,567
瑞秋不可能没人帮助　 就光着脚从锁着的房间里溜走
Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of a locked cell barefoot without any help.

329
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:10,655
她得到了很多的帮助
I think she had alot of help.

330
00:27:10,656 --> 00:27:13,283
也许考利现在正坐在豪宅里
Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion right now,

331
00:27:13,284 --> 00:27:15,893
思考他今晚的态度
rethinking his whole attitude.

332
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,919
-或许到明早...　 -你是虚张声势?
- Maybe in the morning... - You're bluffing?

333
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:22,721
我没这么说
I didn't say that.

334
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:44,666
我发现很多这种酒　泰德
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

335
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:47,586
你是不是一天喝到晚
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

336
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:50,795
我在战争中杀死很多人
I killed alot of people in the war.

337
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,463
所以你就喝酒?
Is that why you drink?

338
00:27:57,186 --> 00:27:58,412
你是讲真的吗
Are you real?

339
00:27:59,607 --> 00:27:59,946
不是
No.

340
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,706
她还在这里
She's still here.

341
00:28:07,328 --> 00:28:07,744
谁
Who?

342
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:10,275
瑞秋?
Rachel?

343
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:14,135
她从未离开
She never left.

344
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,262
记得我们在湖边的小屋吗
Remember when we stayed in the cabin in the summer, Teddy?

345
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:33,879
当时那么幸福
We were so happy.

346
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,400
她在这里
She's here.

347
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,435
你不能走
You can't leave.

348
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,484
我不会走的
I'm not gonna leave.

349
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,869
我如此爱你
I love you so much.

350
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:06,065
我现在已经是棺材里的骨灰了　泰德　不
- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy. - No.

351
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:07,891
是的
I am.

352
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:13,889
你必须清醒过来
You have to wake up.

353
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:16,389
我不会走的
I won't go.

354
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:19,001
你在这里
You're here.

355
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,236
我没有
I'm not.

356
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,814
你必须面对现实
You have to face that.

357
00:29:28,496 --> 00:29:29,487
但她在这里
But she is.

358
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,159
他也是
And so is he.

359
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,216
谁
Who?

360
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:39,868
雷德斯
Laeddis.

361
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:46,675
我必须走了
I have to go.

362
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,278
请不要走
No! Please...just let me hold you.

363
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:55,536
再留一会　泰德
- Just a little bit longer. - Oh, Teddy...

364
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:56,529
你必须让我走
You have to let me go.

365
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,951
我不能
I can't.

366
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:35,976
这样的天气船不会来了
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

367
00:30:39,148 --> 00:30:39,800
医生
Doctor.

368
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:42,231
医生
Doctor, doctor.

369
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:46,200
我们要讯问 和瑞秋一同参加群体治疗的病人
We need to interview the patients who were in Rachel's group therapy session.

370
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:48,078
你的调查不是结束了吗
I thought your investigation was finished?

371
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,123
这种天气会有船来吗？
It's not like we can take the ferry.

372
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:55,715
瑞秋有没有接受其它的治疗?
Now was Rachel receiving any other treatment for her illnesses?

373
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:59,179
你了解当今的精神治疗学派吗
Do you know the state of the mental health field these days, gentlemen?

374
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,292
完全不知道　医生
No. Not a clue doctor.

375
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:01,976
是个战争
War.

376
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:05,814
传统观点认为需要外科手术
The old school believes in surgical intervention.

377
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:11,057
精神外科学　切除前脑叶白质
Psychosurgery. Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy.

378
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:15,643
有人认为病人变得更理性了 有人认为病人变的像僵尸了
Some say the patients become reasonable, docile. Others say they become zombies.

379
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:18,782
现代观点呢　精神药理学
- And the new school? - Psycho pharmacology.

380
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:21,441
一种新型药物已经被批准
A new drug has just been  approved called Thorazine.

381
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:22,814
可以让精神病人放松
Which relaxes psychotic patients.

382
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,196
或者说驯服
You could say it tames them.

383
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:26,461
那么你是哪种观点呢　医生　我?
- And which school are you in, Doc? - Me?

384
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,301
我有一种激进的观点：就是尊重病人
I have this radical idea that if you treat a patient with respect,

385
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,718
倾听他们说话
listen to him,

386
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:34,732
尽力理解　就能懂得病人
try and understand, you just might reach him.

387
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:43,274
这些病人　实时这种病人也可以
- These patients? - Even these.

388
00:31:43,753 --> 00:31:46,030
本来是最后一招　却成为第一疗法
What should be a last resort is becoming a first response.

389
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,513
给病人吃药　让他待上一会　病情就会减轻
Give them a pill, put them in a corner, and it all goes away.

390
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,479
瑞秋以前服用几种药物
Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs

391
00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:56,450
来控制暴力的发作　但效果只有间歇性的
meant to keep her from becoming violent, but it was only intermittently effective.

392
00:31:57,724 --> 00:32:01,310
从以前，她康复的最大障碍就是拒绝面对她曾经的罪行
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was her refusal to face what she had done.

393
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:03,654
"以前"？
"Was."

394
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:08,619
你这么说　是知道她已经死了吗
Is there a reason you keep referring to your patient in the past tense, doctor?

395
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:14,615
看外面是什么天气吧
Look outside, marshal.

396
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,119
她还能活着吗
Why do you think?

397
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:27,044
下一个是彼得布尔　用药罐的玻璃碎片割伤他爸爸看护
Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted his father's nurse with a broken glass.

398
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,759
护士没死　但却终身毁容了
Nurse survived, but her face permaanently disfigured.

399
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,038
真想见见这个人
I can't wait.

400
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:35,554
她常对我笑　很客气
She'd smiles at me. She was so sweet.

401
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:40,566
但是从她的眼睛里能看出来　她喜欢裸体
But... I could see it in her eyes. She liked to be naked.

402
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,236
喜欢性爱
To suck cock.

403
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,230
好了　布尔先生
Okay, Mr. Breen.

404
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:49,246
她和我单独在厨房里
And then she asked me if she can have a glass of water?

405
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:52,961
对我轻松的说，帮我倒杯水
Alone in the kitchen? Like that's no big deal?

406
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:56,341
-喝杯水怎么了　 -他这样的隐喻还不明显吗？
- Why was that a big deal? - It was obvious.

407
00:32:56,342 --> 00:33:01,819
她就是为了让我脱下裤子　 嘲笑我的家伙多么小
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she could laugh at it.

408
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:03,212
布尔先生
Mr. Breen,

409
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:09,331
我们需要问你一些问题
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

410
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,091
我一边划　她一边叫
When I cut her she screamed

411
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:15,235
不过
But...

412
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:17,761
她怕我
She scared me.

413
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,160
我当然要让她怕我
What did she expect?

414
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:21,672
是吗
Interesting.

415
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:26,471
但我们是来问你有关瑞秋索兰多的事情
But we are here to talk Rachel Solando, okay?

416
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:27,959
瑞秋索兰多
Rachel Solando...

417
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:30,936
你知道她淹死了自己的孩子吗
Did you know she had drowned her own kids?

418
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:32,764
她淹死了自己的孩子
She drowned her kids!

419
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:36,486
真是个变态的世界
This is a sick fucking world we live in. I'll tell you that...

420
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:38,072
这种人应该被关到毒气室
You know what? They should be gassed.

421
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:41,177
也包括白痴杀人犯
All of them... the retards, the killers

422
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:45,903
还有黑人　杀死自己的孩子　这贱货就该被毒死
the niggers. You kill your own kid? Gas the bitch!

423
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:50,077
你能不能不要画了?
Would you... stop that?

424
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,431
-护士.. -停下来!
- A nurse? - Please. Stop that.

425
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,510
护士或许有孩子
A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh?

426
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,034
有丈夫
A husband...

427
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:04,338
只想赚点钱贴补家用
Just trying to make ends meet,

428
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,891
只想正常地过日子
to lead a normal life...

429
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,917
她照顾你父亲
And it says in your file that uh...

430
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:14,511
你却划破她的脸　是不是
You tore her face off, didn't you?

431
00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:21,245
恭喜你　她再也过不了什么正常生活了
Congratulations, no more normal for her, not ever again, no.

432
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,308
你知道她害怕的是什么吗
Do you know what she was afraid of?

433
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:27,818
是你
You.

434
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:30,947
你能不能不要画了
Could you stop that, please?!

435
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:33,431
别画了!
Stop that!

436
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:36,321
别再画了!
Please... stop!

437
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,912
-你认识一个叫安德鲁雷德斯的病人吗？ -不认识
You know a patient by the name of Andrew Laeddis?

438
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:43,938
我想回去
- I want to go back. - Take him!

439
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:03,164
我永远不会出院的
I'll never get out of here.

440
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,173
我也不该出去
I'm not sure that I should.

441
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:08,380
有句话可能不合适
Excuse me for saying this,

442
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:10,467
-卡恩斯小姐　 -太太
- Miss Kearns... - Misses.

443
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:11,563
卡恩斯太太
Mrs. Kearns.

444
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:14,897
你看起来...
But you seem...

445
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,010
很正常
quite normal,...

446
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:19,856
和其它病人相比的话
I mean in comparison with the other patients here.

447
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:24,344
每个人都做过不光彩的事情
Well, I have my dark days I suppose everybody does.

448
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:30,331
只不过一般人不会拿斧头把自己老公砍死的
The difference is that most people don't kill their husbands with an axe.

449
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:34,045
尤其老公又他见过的一半女人上床
Although personally I think if a man beats you and fucks

450
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:38,428
跟很多女人鬼混的人　是没人会帮他的
half the women he sees and no one will help you,

451
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:43,894
拿斧头砍死他　是很容易理解的
axing him isn't the least understandable thing you can do.

452
00:35:43,895 --> 00:35:46,451
或许你真不该出院
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

453
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:49,278
我出院又能干什么呢
And what would I do if I did?

454
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:52,867
我已经不了解当今世界了　据说现在有一种
I don't know the world anymore. They say there are

455
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:56,080
把整个城市夷为平地的炸弹
bombs that can reduce whole cities to ash

456
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:59,210
还有一种叫做电视的东西
And what do they call "televisions"...

457
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:02,288
人关在盒子里还有声音跟影像
voices and faces coming from a box.

458
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:05,137
我在这里早就听腻声音了
I hear enough voices already

459
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,757
你知道瑞秋的什么东西？
What can you tell us about Rachel?

460
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:14,052
了解不多　她很内向
Um. Not much, she... she keeps to herself.

461
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:18,355
她相信她的孩子还活着
She believed her kids were alive.

462
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:24,040
她以为仍然自己还住在伯克郡　 而我们都是她的邻居
She thought she was still living in the Berkshires and we were all neighbours

463
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,910
快递小弟　邮差...　送货员
- The milkman, postmen... - Deliveryman,

464
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:30,801
那晚希恩医生也在
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

465
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:31,219
是的
Yes. Um.

466
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,913
他讲解怎么控制发怒的情绪
He talked about anger.

467
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:39,013
说些有关他的事情..
Tell me about him...

468
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:41,042
他是什么样的人
What's he like?

469
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:42,842
他...
I think he's uh...

470
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:47,850
不错　还满好的
Okay... nice.

471
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,213
用我妈妈的话说　是那种目光和蔼的人
Not hard on the eyes as my mother would say.

472
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:57,641
他勾引过你吗
Did he ever make a pass at you?

473
00:36:57,844 --> 00:36:58,183
没有
No.

474
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,339
希恩是个好医生　他不会做出...
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good doctor, he would never...

475
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,484
能给我倒杯水吗
Could I have a glass of water, please?

476
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:09,503
没问题
No problem.

477
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,535
谢谢你,警官
Thank you, marshal.

478
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:35,064
我还有一个问题 卡思斯太大
I have just one more question for you Mrs. Kearns.

479
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:40,486
你有没有见过叫安德鲁雷德斯的病人
Did you ever meet a patient named Andrew Laeddis?

480
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:44,598
没有
No.

481
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:48,210
没听说过
Never heard of him.

482
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,489
她的回答有人指点过
She was coached.

483
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:59,231
所有的话，跟考利和护士的回答如出一辙
She used practically the same words as Cawley and the nurse.

484
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:02,068
-让她说什么　她就说什么　 -安德鲁雷德斯是谁?
- Like she'd been told exactly what to say. - Who is Andrew Laeddis?

485
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:11,684
为何每个病人你都会问到这人？他是谁？
You asked every one of those patients back there about him. Who is he?

486
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:17,876
对我也要隐瞒? 我可是你的搭档
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner for the Christ's sake!

487
00:38:18,153 --> 00:38:20,049
我们认识不久　查克
We just met, Chuck.

488
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,251
你一直是行政人员
You've been on the beat a long time.

489
00:38:22,978 --> 00:38:26,732
有职责　有事业　而我做的
You got a duty, got a career. What I'm doing,

490
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,924
严格上来讲，并不是遵守法律规范的
is not exactly by the book.

491
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:36,770
我才不管什么法律勒　我只想知道是怎么回事
I don't give a damn about "by the book", boss I just to know what the hell is going on.

492
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:43,452
这件案子提报到单位的时候
When this case came over the wires,

493
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:48,590
-我主动要求要办里这件案子　你知道吗？ -为什么
- I requested it specifically. Do you understand? - Why?

494
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,726
安德鲁雷德斯
Andrew Laeddis,

495
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:57,624
是我和我老婆住的公寓里同栋的维修工
was the maintenance man in the apartment building where my wife and I lived.

496
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,363
然后呢？
Okay.

497
00:39:01,788 --> 00:39:03,822
他是个纵火犯
He was also a firebug.

498
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:09,169
安德鲁雷德斯点着了火柴
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

499
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:15,607
搞出了害死我妻子的火灾
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

500
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:23,807
锁上
Let 'em out!

501
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:29,085
雷德斯后来怎么样了
What happened to Laeddis?

502
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:32,939
逃离了追捕　然后就失踪了
Got away with it. Laeddis got away with it and disappeared.

503
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,873
大概一年前　我在份报纸上看到了他
About a year ago, I opened up the newspaper and there he is.

504
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,039
这丑陋的混蛋
He's an ugly looking son of a bitch.

505
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,662
有一道长长的伤疤　从右太阳穴一直划到左嘴唇
He had a new scar from his right temple down to his left lip.

506
00:39:40,663 --> 00:39:44,076
眼球的颜色两边不一样　是一副让人印象深刻的面孔
Eyes different colors. Not the type of face you forget.

507
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:47,283
后来他烧毁一间学校　死了两个人
He'd burned down a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.

508
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,199
说是奉了神的旨意
He said voices told him to do it.

509
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,906
先进了监狱　然后转移到这里
First he was sent to prison and then he was transferred here.

510
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,070
-后来呢？ -后来就没有消息了
- Then what? - Then, nothing.

511
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:58,025
他整个人就这样消失了　好像从未存在　没有任何记录
He vanished like he never existed. No record whatsoever.

512
00:39:58,026 --> 00:40:00,686
他如果不在女性病房　那么肯定在C栋病房了
I'm sure he's not in ward B that leaves ward C.

513
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:01,899
搞不好他早死了
Or he could be dead.

514
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,261
瑞秋搞不好也死了　这里藏几具尸体还是很简单的
So could Rachel Solando for that matter. Lot of places to hide a body here.

515
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,691
只有一个地方没有人注意到
Only one place no one really knows.

516
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:26,425
那个卡恩斯太太　让我去倒水的时候
That patient, Bridget Kearne, when she sent me for water,

517
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:29,466
对你说过什么吧
she said something to you back there, didn't she?

518
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:29,805
没有
No.

519
00:40:32,673 --> 00:40:33,896
得了吧　老大
Come on boss!

520
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:38,810
她用写的
She wrote it.

521
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:54,946
老大
Boss!

522
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:59,905
我们要到屋里去　暴风要演变成飓风了
We gotta get indoors. It's turning into fucking Kansas out here...

523
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:02,301
好　我们走吧
- All right. - Now. Let's go!

524
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:05,800
当心
Watch out!

525
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,183
天啊
Jesus!

526
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,893
快　我们回去
Come on! Let's go back!

527
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,485
天啊
Jesus Christ! Damn it!

528
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:48,659
你没事吧　我没事
- Are you okay boss? - Yes. That's all right.

529
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:57,247
雷德斯一定在这里
So... if Laeddis is here...

530
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,007
你打算怎么办呢 老大
What are you going to do boss?

531
00:42:01,704 --> 00:42:04,385
我不是来杀雷德斯的
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

532
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:15,523
如果他烧死是我老婆的话　我会让他死两遍
If it was my wife I'd kill him twice.

533
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:31,426
我们进入达豪集中营大门的时候　纳粹军队直接投降
When we got through the gates of Dakau, the SS guards surrendered.

534
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:43,737
指挥官本想在我们到达之前自杀
The commandante tried to kill himself before we got there...

535
00:42:45,428 --> 00:42:47,016
但他自杀技巧不怎么在行
but he botched it.

536
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,419
搞的最后过了一小时才死
Took him an hour to die.

537
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:59,404
我到外面的时候 看见地上都是尸体
When I went outside, I saw all the bodies on the ground.

538
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:04,923
多的数不胜数
Too many to count.

539
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,682
多的无法想象
Too many to imagine.

540
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,142
那些纳粹军队
So yeah

541
00:43:40,188 --> 00:43:45,601
集体投降了　我们先让他们缴械　然后排成一排
The guards surrendered, we took their guns, we lined them up...

542
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,789
那不是战争
It wasn't warfare,

543
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:33,542
那是谋杀
it was murder.

544
00:44:37,988 --> 00:44:39,939
我厌倦了杀人
Yeah I've had enough of killing.

545
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,072
我来这里不是为了报仇的
That's not why I'm here.

546
00:44:45,774 --> 00:44:48,012
那是为了什么
So what is this all about?

547
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:52,150
雷德斯失踪以后
After Laeddis vanished,

548
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:57,116
我开始研究这精神病院
I started doing some checking on Ashecliffe.

549
00:44:57,351 --> 00:45:02,430
很多人知道这个地方　但是没有人愿意讲
A lot of people knew about this place, but no one wants to talk...

550
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:05,293
好像害怕什么
You know? It's like they're scared of something.

551
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:10,134
这个地方经费来源是由特别基金赞助的
You know this place is funded by a special grant

552
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:13,340
来自于美国行动委员会
from the House of Unamerican Activities Committee.

553
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:19,503
在波士顿港的小岛上 要怎么和共产党作战?
HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor?

554
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:22,757
通过进行心理实验
By conducting experiments on the mind.

555
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,000
我是这么认为的
At least that's my guess.

556
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:26,999
你觉得这里在进行心理实验?
And you think thats going on in here?

557
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,289
我说过　没人愿意谈论
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

558
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,121
但我后来找到一个以前在这里的病人
Until I found someone who used to be a patient here.

559
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:33,995
一个叫乔治诺伊斯的人
Guy's name is George Noyce.

560
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:36,521
很好的大学生 是个社会主义者
Nice college kid. Socialist.

561
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:40,324
他得到资金进行后心理研究 你猜他们在测试什么？
He gets offered some money to do a psych study. Guess what they were testing?

562
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:43,656
精神病的药－后来就出现很多脾气暴躁的人
- Tooth paste? - So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

563
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,612
他差点把自己的教授打死 最后来到了隔离岛
Almost beats his professor to death Ends up here in Ashecliffe.

564
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:49,263
c栋病房
Ward C.

565
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:53,025
一年后把他重获自由　但他做了什么呢
They released him after 1 year, right? What does he do?

566
00:45:53,026 --> 00:45:58,563
回到陆地三礼拜后　他就到酒吧里刺死了三个人
Two weeks on the mainland he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death.

567
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:01,687
诺伊斯的律师辩称是精神病　
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce...

568
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:03,852
但是他站在法庭上
Noyce, he stands up in the courtroom and

569
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:05,726
乞求法官判他死刑
he begs the judge, for the electric chair.

570
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:08,642
说什么不愿回到隔离岛来
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

571
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:12,312
法官没判处死刑　让他在戴德姆监狱服刑
Judge gives him life in Dedham prison.

572
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,553
你找到了他　对　我找到了他
- And you found him? - Yeah, I found him.

573
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:17,673
他根本不成人形
Well, he's a mess

574
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:22,591
但是他对我说的话却很明白
- But it's pretty clear from what he tells me, ... - What?

575
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:25,590
这里在进行特殊的人体实验
... they're experimenting on people here.

576
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:27,465
我不信
I don't know, boss.

577
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:31,835
不相信疯子的话　这就是好处
- How do you believe a crazy guy? - That's the beauty of it isn't it?

578
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:36,542
精神病人是最合适的试验品　 就算说出去也没有人相信
Crazy people are perfect subjects. They talk, but nobody listens.

579
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,209
我去过达豪集中营
I stood in Dakau.

580
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:43,287
我们见过人对人能做出什么残忍的事
We saw what human beings are capable of doing to each other, right?

581
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,786
为了阻止这种暴行　我们参加了战争
For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war

582
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:48,242
而如今这里却存在这种残忍的暴行？
to stop them, and now I find out it may be happening here?

583
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:50,969
在我们的国土上? 不行
On our soil? No.

584
00:46:52,158 --> 00:46:55,155
那你来这里的真正目的是什么　泰德
So what are you really here to do, Teddy?

585
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:57,603
我来找证据
I'm gonna get the proof,

586
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:01,943
回去揭露这里的真相
I'm gonna go back, and blow the lid off this place.

587
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:02,855
这就是目的
That's it.

588
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:05,244
慢着
Wait a minute.

589
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:09,230
你一直在调查隔离岛
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.

590
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:14,520
就想找机会到这里来　而他们却恰恰需要一个 联邦警察　不可疑吗
Waiting for a chance to get out here then suddenly they need a US marshal?

591
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:17,393
是我运气好，有个病人逃走了 就成了我的借口
I got lucky. There was a patient escape, it was the perfect excuse.

592
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:20,474
不　老大　这不是运气
No, no, no boss. Luck doesn't work that way.

593
00:47:20,475 --> 00:47:25,180
不是这样的　污水处理设施上都有电网
The world doesn't work that way. They got an electrified fence around a septic facility.

594
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:28,304
C栋病房还在内战时的堡垒里面
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

595
00:47:28,803 --> 00:47:32,966
一个这的高层和纳粹党卫军有关联 资金又来自美国行动委员会
A chief of staff with ties to the OSS Funding from HUAC?

596
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:37,130
一切都说明这是政府刻意安排的
Jesus Christ! Everything about this place stinks of "government ops".

597
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:39,213
-或许是故意让你来这里　 -胡扯
- What If they wanted you here? - Bullshit.

598
00:47:39,214 --> 00:47:41,086
-你可能一直被监控　 -胡说
- You were asking questions. - Bullshit.

599
00:47:41,087 --> 00:47:46,417
胡说? 瑞秋的人呢？ 为什么没有她存在的一点点证据?
Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is one shred of evidence that she even existed?

600
00:47:46,418 --> 00:47:48,873
他们不可能知道我被指派调查这件案子...
There's no way they could of known I'd be assigned to this case. No way...

601
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,914
你这是螳螂捕蝉黄雀在后
While you were looking into them, they were looking into you.

602
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:54,573
他们只需要编造个理由　把你引到这里
All they need to do is fake an escape to get you here.

603
00:47:54,574 --> 00:47:59,337
现在把你引来了　把我们都引来了
And now they have you. Now they have us both, here, now.

604
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,620
警官　你在这里吗
Marshal, are you out here?

605
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,809
我是麦克弗森副典狱长
This is deputy warden McPherson.

606
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:08,375
联邦警察
Marshal!

607
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,320
怎么办　他们找到了我们
How about that? They found us huh.

608
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:13,539
这是个岛上　要找到我们还不简单
It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us.

609
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:16,069
我知道你在里面
I know you are in there...

610
00:48:17,952 --> 00:48:20,253
我们离开这个岛
We're getting off of this Goddamned island. You and me.

611
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:21,746
快
Come on!

612
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:27,343
快
- Come on! - Go!

613
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,385
换上干衣服 考利医生现在想见你们
Get dried off. Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

614
00:48:41,263 --> 00:48:44,132
快点 马上就变成飓风了
And hurry up, this thing is turning into a goddamn hurricane!

615
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:51,337
我把西装送去洗了
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.

616
00:48:52,317 --> 00:48:53,375
明天应该会好
It should be ready by tomorrow.

617
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:55,899
如果你们没有被冲走的话
That is if we don't all wash away first.

618
00:48:57,146 --> 00:49:01,040
说到这一点　你们的烟已经湿掉不能抽了
Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were pretty much done for.

619
00:49:01,954 --> 00:49:02,823
所以...
So...

620
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:06,344
我们只能穿这种衣服
This is our only choice, huh?

621
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:10,055
这在监狱已经是不错的衣服了　不行吗
Got something really nice in prison already if that don't work for you...

622
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:12,566
这衣服可以
Now that you mention it, these are just fine.

623
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:17,236
因此我仍然坚持C栋病房的所有病人
That's why I must repeat my insistence that all ward C patients

624
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:18,625
都要上脚链严格看管
be placed in manual restraints.

625
00:49:19,537 --> 00:49:22,662
如果淹水 会害死他们的 你是知道的
If the facility floods, they'll drown. You know that.

626
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:25,559
-这需要有很大的雨　 -我们在岛上
- That would take a lot of flooding. - We are on an island,

627
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:27,214
周围都是海洋又是飓风期间
in the middle of the ocean, during a hurricane.

628
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:29,789
淹大水是很有可能的
A lot of flooding seems like a distinct possibility.

629
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:32,508
应该要赌下去， 史蒂芬,假设供电失效的话
It's a gamble, Steven. Say the power fails, ...

630
00:49:32,902 --> 00:49:33,813
我们还有备用发电机
There's a backup generator.

631
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:36,399
但若是停电　牢房门就会打开
And if that goes? The cell doors will open.

632
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,541
他们能去哪儿呢?
Where are they going to go?

633
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:43,664
不可能　跑到码头上　在飓风中游到其它陆地
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over to the mainland and wreak havoc.

634
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:47,616
你说得对　他们只会跑到我们这里来
You're quite right. They're far more likely to wreak havoc right here on us.

635
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:50,484
如果他们带着脚铐 他们会因此丧命的
If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.

636
00:49:51,981 --> 00:49:53,263
这可是24条人命啊
That's 24 human beings.

637
00:49:54,184 --> 00:49:55,950
你能承担的起吗？
You can live with that, can you?

638
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,782
说实话 如果我来做决定的话
Frankly, if it were up to me,

639
00:49:58,124 --> 00:50:01,367
我会让A栋病房和B栋病房的42个人 直接集中由人工看管
I'd put all 42 in wards A and B in manual restraints as well.

640
00:50:01,618 --> 00:50:02,411
打扰一下
Excuse me Excuse me

641
00:50:03,472 --> 00:50:06,978
-警官　 -对不起先生　我只有一个小问题
- Marshal. - I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.

642
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:08,392
我等一会就和你谈
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

643
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:11,092
我们今天早上谈过有关 瑞秋索兰多留下的纸条
We spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note.

644
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:13,014
"第四条定律"　我喜欢这句
The law of 4, I loved that.

645
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:16,537
你说你不明白第二句话什么意思是不是
You said you had no idea what that second line could refer to. Correct?

646
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:18,855
谁是67号
Who is 67?

647
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,659
我仍然不明白　我们都不明白
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't. None of us do.

648
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,638
一点都想不起来?
Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.

649
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:28,308
一点都没有?
Nothing?

650
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,584
我刚才听你们说
Because I believe I just heard you say there are

651
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,217
C栋病房有24名病人
24 patients in ward C.

652
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:40,514
A栋病房和B栋病房有42个人
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B

653
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:44,098
这说明精神病院里有66名病人
Which means there is a total of what? 66 patients here in this facility.

654
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,834
没错
That is correct, yes.

655
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:52,751
那么瑞秋的意思是
Then it seems that Rachel Solando was suggesting

656
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:56,457
你们还有第67名病人　医生
that you have a 67th patient, doctor.

657
00:50:57,709 --> 00:51:01,081
－但我们没有　太荒庸了
- But I'm afraid we don't. - This is ridiculous.

658
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:03,503
你到这里干什么　我到这里是为了工作
- What are you doing here? - We are doing our goddamn job.

659
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:06,671
麦克弗森没告诉你一个好消息吗
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

660
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,658
什么好消息
No, what's the good news, doctor?

661
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:12,052
瑞秋找到了
Rachel has been found.

662
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:14,542
她在这里
She's here.

663
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:17,309
非常安全
Safe and sound.

664
00:51:29,557 --> 00:51:30,603
身上没有什么伤痕
There is not a mark on her.

665
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,097
这两人是谁
Who are these men?

666
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:41,107
为什么在我的房子里？
Why are they in my house?

667
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:43,014
他们是警察　瑞秋
Police officers, Rachel.

668
00:51:43,387 --> 00:51:45,648
他们要问几个问题
They... have a few questions.

669
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:50,394
夫人
Ma'am.

670
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:56,821
有人看见一个匪谍
There's been a sighting of a known Communist

671
00:51:56,856 --> 00:52:00,149
在这里搞破坏　散发传单
subversive in this area passing out literature

672
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,614
在这里?
Here?

673
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,197
在这小区里?
In this neighborhood?

674
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,931
是的
Yes, I'm afraid so.

675
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:13,918
告诉我们你昨天在哪里　做了什么
Now, if you can tell us what you did yesterday, where you were,

676
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,230
将会帮助我们缩小围捕范围
it would really help us narrow our search.

677
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:18,864
好
Yes...

678
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,228
我...
Well, I...umm

679
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,733
我为吉姆和孩子们做了早餐
I made breakfast for Jim and the children,

680
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:32,376
然后我...
and then I...

681
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,810
为吉姆包好便当  他就去上班了
I packed Jim's lunch and he left.

682
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:43,943
然后我送孩子们上学
Then I sent the children off to school.

683
00:52:47,587 --> 00:52:48,602
然后...
And then...

684
00:52:55,284 --> 00:52:59,133
我去湖里游泳
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

685
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,049
我知道了
I see...

686
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,765
在这之后呢
And after that?

687
00:53:19,831 --> 00:53:21,001
在这之后
After that...

688
00:53:30,648 --> 00:53:32,234
我想起了你
I thought of you.

689
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,092
对不起夫人
I... I'm sorry, ma'am.

690
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:43,448
我不明白你的意思
I don't know what you're talking about.

691
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:49,397
你不知道我有多么孤独吗　吉姆?
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

692
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,664
你走了
You're gone...

693
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:00,833
你死了
You're dead.

694
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:08,718
我每天都掉眼泪
I cry every night.

695
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,544
我怎么活下去呢
How am I supposed to survive?

696
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:19,119
天啊
God.

697
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:32,427
瑞秋　会好起来的
Rachel... it will be all right.

698
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:37,840
我很对不起　不过
I'm so sorry, but...

699
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:42,516
一切都会好起来的
everything is gonna be all right? Okay?

700
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,434
我明明把你埋了
I buried you.

701
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:52,818
我埋了空棺材　你的尸体上都是血　我把你丢到到大海里
I buried an empty casket. Your body rained down lumps of flesh splashing

702
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:54,275
尸体全喂给鲨鱼了
into the sea eaten by sharks.

703
00:54:58,436 --> 00:55:02,207
我的吉姆已经死了　你到底是谁
My Jim is dead, So who the fuck are you?

704
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:06,419
你到底是谁
Who the fuck are you?!

705
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:09,404
你是谁
Who are you?! Who are you?!

706
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:21,235
对不起
I'm sorry about that.

707
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:24,647
我本不想打断　我以为她会对你说出什么线索
I didn't want to interrupt, I thought she might tell you something, but...

708
00:55:24,648 --> 00:55:26,768
我们在灯塔旁找到了她
we found her down by the lighthouse,

709
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:28,173
正在岩石上跳跃
skipping stones.

710
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,383
我们不知道她是怎么到了那里　我要请你们到地下室
We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going to ask you both to go down into basement.

711
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:37,545
那里有食物　水、床　在飓风到来的时候
There's food, water, and cots. It's the safest place to be

712
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:39,677
这是最安全的地方
when the hurricane hits.

713
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:45,366
你没事吧　你面色苍白
Are you all right? You look pale.

714
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:47,447
我没事　只是...
I'm fine, it's just uh...

715
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:50,312
老大你没事吧
Boss, are you okay?

716
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:53,769
只是太亮了点　不是吗
It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it?

717
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:58,430
感光　有时头疼　警官　你有偏头痛吗
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes? Marshal are you having a migraine?

718
00:55:58,431 --> 00:55:59,522
我没事
I'll be alright.

719
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:11,286
吃了这药　过几个小时就好了
- What's wrong with him. - Take these, marshal. You'll sleep a couple of hours, wake up clear as a bell.

720
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:13,741
你这是偏头痛 就像有人在里面想锯开你的脑袋
He's having a migraine. Imagine someone sawed open your head and

721
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:15,862
用雷射使劲照你
filled it with razors then shook it as hard as they could.

722
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:17,402
把这药吃了吧 警官
Take the pills, marshal.

723
00:56:17,403 --> 00:56:22,110
-我不想吃　 -这能镇痛　吃药吧
- No... I don't want the pills. - It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.

724
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:28,090
你需要躺下
He's going to need to lie down.

725
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:34,418
上帝!
Oh God!

726
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,707
小心点 好了
Careful. All right.

727
00:56:53,183 --> 00:56:55,082
不会有事的
Gonna be okay. Relax.

728
00:57:02,004 --> 00:57:03,903
那是谁　他吗
- Who is that? - Him?

729
00:57:04,918 --> 00:57:06,580
他是典狱长
That's the warden.

730
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,600
别管他了
Don't you worry about him, alright?

731
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:19,848
看来是个退休军官的混蛋
Looks like an ex-military prick.

732
00:57:20,727 --> 00:57:24,445
这一点我不能发表看法
You know what? I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

733
00:58:49,266 --> 00:58:51,532
你应该要救我的
You should have saved me.

734
00:58:53,641 --> 00:58:56,556
你应该要救了我们所有人
You should have saved all of us.

735
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:26,889
嘿　兄弟
Hey buddy.

736
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:29,739
嘿.
Hey.

737
00:59:30,251 --> 00:59:30,981
雷德斯
Laeddis.

738
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,517
是的
Yes.

739
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,309
嘿　兄弟
Hi, buddy.

740
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:49,921
不再生气了吧
No hard feelings, right?

741
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:57,947
别再生气了
No hard feelings.

742
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:13,982
留给你以后喝
Little something for later.

743
01:00:17,443 --> 01:00:20,047
我知道你多么需要
Because I know how much you need it.

744
01:00:25,774 --> 01:00:28,194
时间片刻不停. 我的朋友
Clock's ticking, my friend.

745
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:31,079
我们时间不多了
We're running out of time.

746
01:00:40,435 --> 01:00:42,310
帮我一下
Give me a hand here.

747
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,036
我会惹上麻烦的
I could get into trouble.

748
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,620
我死了吗
I'm dead?

749
01:01:38,872 --> 01:01:41,190
对不起
I'm so sorry.

750
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:44,860
你为什么不救我
Why didn't you save me?

751
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:49,493
我也想救你　但是我赶到的时候
I tried, I wanted to, but by the time I got there,

752
01:01:49,494 --> 01:01:51,005
已经太晚了
it was too late.

753
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,318
看
See?

754
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,020
多美啊
Aren't they beautiful?

755
01:03:13,507 --> 01:03:15,900
你为什么全身都湿了
Why are you all wet, baby?

756
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:19,957
雷德斯没有死
Laeddis isn't dead.

757
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:22,689
他没有走
He isn't gone.

758
01:03:24,252 --> 01:03:25,763
他还在这里
He's still here.

759
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:29,745
我知道
I know.

760
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,498
我需要找到他　泰德
We need to find him, Teddy.

761
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:35,336
你找到他　把他杀死
You need to find him and you kill him dead.

762
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:53,481
没关系
Shhh. It's okay.

763
01:04:06,113 --> 01:04:06,685
A栋病房我知道了
Shh. Again!

764
01:04:07,153 --> 01:04:08,923
发电机出现故障
The generator is flooded.

765
01:04:13,946 --> 01:04:15,713
你没事吧 老大
Are you okay boss?

766
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:19,931
该死的偏头痛
This goddamn migraine!

767
01:04:19,962 --> 01:04:24,412
备用发电机坏了　这里整个一团混乱
Back up generators failed. The whole place has gone crazy.

768
01:04:25,585 --> 01:04:27,745
你想干什么
What do you want to do?

769
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:33,857
天啊
Christ!

770
01:04:34,624 --> 01:04:36,939
不不 放下来
No, no, no! Put it down.

771
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:38,440
快　快
Now! Now!

772
01:04:49,409 --> 01:04:52,195
整个供电系统都瘫痪了?
You think the whole electrical system is fried?

773
01:04:52,197 --> 01:04:55,283
很可能
I'd say that it's a good possibility.

774
01:04:55,284 --> 01:04:57,281
所有的电子保全系统
All electronic security...

775
01:04:57,282 --> 01:04:59,051
围墙电网　大门
fences, gates, the doors

776
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:00,937
快
Come on.

777
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:03,736
这是散步的好时候
Nice day for a stroll don't you think?

778
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:06,810
比如到C栋病房散个步
To ward C for example.

779
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:11,765
或许你会碰到安德鲁雷德斯
Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis.

780
01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:18,981
我给你说过的那个人　乔治诺伊斯
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

781
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:21,856
他说真正的狠脚色都在这里
He told me this is where they keep the worse ones.

782
01:05:21,857 --> 01:05:25,657
连其它病房的人都怕他们
The guys even the other inmates are scared of.

783
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:28,848
诺伊斯说过实验室的事吗
Noyce give you anything on the layout?

784
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:29,863
没有
Not really.

785
01:05:30,145 --> 01:05:34,054
他只记得人们从早到晚都在惨叫　没有窗户
All that he remembers was people scream day and night. There were no windows.

786
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,424
到处都是栅栏
There were bars everywhere.

787
01:05:56,802 --> 01:05:58,052
天啊
Jesus Christ!

788
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:01,721
第一次到C栋病房吧
First time on ward C, right?

789
01:06:02,169 --> 01:06:03,881
是的
- Yes, yes... - Yes.

790
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:08,088
我们听说...　相信我　你们听说的都是胡扯的
- Yeah, heard stories, but... - Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.

791
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,587
多数病人都关起来了
We got most of the bugsies locked down now,

792
01:06:10,588 --> 01:06:12,628
但还有一些人在外面
But some of them are still loose.

793
01:06:12,629 --> 01:06:15,377
如果见到了　不要试图凭自己制服他
If you see one don't try to restrain him yourselves.

794
01:06:15,378 --> 01:06:17,086
这些混蛋会杀了你们
These fuckers will kill you.

795
01:06:17,087 --> 01:06:17,657
明白吗
Clear?

796
01:06:18,795 --> 01:06:22,152
好了　进去吧
Alright. Get your asses moving then. Go on.

797
01:07:18,522 --> 01:07:19,512
他在这里
He's here.

798
01:07:23,729 --> 01:07:24,457
雷德斯
Laeddis.

799
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,451
我能感觉到他
I can feel him.

800
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:32,862
碰到了　换当鬼抓我了
Tag! You're it.

801
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,016
泰德
Ted!

802
01:08:31,155 --> 01:08:32,385
听我说
Listen to me!

803
01:08:33,127 --> 01:08:35,141
听着　我不想离开好么
Listen! I do not want to leave, all right?

804
01:08:35,518 --> 01:08:39,498
为什么有人不想呢　我听说过这里的很多事情
Why would anyone want to? We hear things here.

805
01:08:39,624 --> 01:08:42,223
关于外面的世界　关于珊瑚礁
About the outside world. About atolls.

806
01:08:42,263 --> 01:08:44,863
关于氢弹测试
About the h-bomb tests.

807
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:48,005
你知道氢弹是怎么作的　
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

808
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:50,604
用　氢气　真好笑
- With... Hydrogen? - That's funny.

809
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:53,327
别的炸弹是会爆炸
- Boss! - Other bombs explode, right?

810
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:57,183
但是氢弹不会 它是内部溶掉的
But not the hydrogen bomb It implodes.

811
01:08:57,225 --> 01:09:01,706
瞬间会产生好几百万度的高温
Creating an explosion to the thousandth millionth degree.

812
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:03,594
-了解了吗? -是的　是
- Do you get it? - Yeah. Yeah.

813
01:09:03,635 --> 01:09:05,311
是么　我明白了
- Do you? - I get it!

814
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:07,282
滚吧
Let em go!

815
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:23,204
不
No!

816
01:09:24,878 --> 01:09:25,594
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

817
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:28,824
上帝　泰德　天
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

818
01:09:30,107 --> 01:09:30,958
你抓到了比尔了
You got Billings?

819
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:35,092
你们到底在干嘛　是抓住他们　不是杀了他们
What's the fuck's the matter with you guys? You catch them, not kill them!

820
01:09:35,122 --> 01:09:35,902
他扑过来攻击我
He jumped us.

821
01:09:36,106 --> 01:09:39,270
你来帮我一把　我们把他弄到医务室去
You, give me a hand with him. We've got to get him to the infirmary.

822
01:09:39,893 --> 01:09:40,689
可恶!
Goddamnit!

823
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,012
-不　不是你　 -去四处逛逛吧
No, no! Not you, not you. Take a walk.

824
01:09:43,808 --> 01:09:44,533
快点
Come on!

825
01:09:44,568 --> 01:09:46,671
去你的屋顶上吧
Paula's gonna have my Goddamn balls for this..

826
01:10:18,595 --> 01:10:19,600
雷德斯
<i>Laeddis....</i>

827
01:10:40,964 --> 01:10:41,978
雷德斯
<i>Laeddis....</i>

828
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:55,731
求求你
Please...

829
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,198
上帝
Oh my God!

830
01:10:59,392 --> 01:11:01,953
<i>在我杀掉更多人之前阻止我</i>
<i>Stop me. Before I kill more.</i>

831
01:11:02,956 --> 01:11:04,166
<i>雷德斯 ...</i>
<i>Laeddis ...</i>

832
01:11:08,476 --> 01:11:09,099
去吧
Go!

833
01:11:12,163 --> 01:11:13,815
拜托　拜托
<i>Please, please!</i>

834
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:24,184
雷德斯
<i>Laeddis ...</i>

835
01:11:31,476 --> 01:11:33,548
你说过我自由了
<i>You told me I'd be free of this place.</i>

836
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,782
你保证过的
<i>You promised.</i>

837
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,061
你骗人!
<i>You lied.</i>

838
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,169
雷德斯　
Laeddis?

839
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,638
雷德斯
Laeddis?

840
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:52,058
真他妈的有趣
That's pretty damned funny.

841
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:55,652
你的声音
Your voice...

842
01:11:55,946 --> 01:11:57,621
你听不出来么
Don't you recognize it?

843
01:11:57,622 --> 01:12:00,179
我们说了那么多话
After all the talks we had?

844
01:12:00,222 --> 01:12:02,779
你对我说了那么多谎
After all the lies you've told me?

845
01:12:02,863 --> 01:12:04,747
给我看看你的脸
Let me see your face.

846
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,387
他们说我是他们的了
They say I'm theirs now.

847
01:12:08,183 --> 01:12:11,032
他们说我永远也走不了
They say I'll never leave here.

848
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:14,469
你的对手就要出去了
Your match is about to go out.

849
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,659
给我看看你该死的脸
Let me see your goddamn face now!

850
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,707
为什么
Why?

851
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:22,180
所以你还继续说谎吗?
So you can lie to me more?

852
01:12:22,222 --> 01:12:24,611
这跟真相无关　不 有关系
- This isn't about the truth! - Yes it is.

853
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:28,424
跟曝光有关　这跟你有关
- It's about exposing the truth. - This is about you!

854
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:29,973
还有　雷德斯
And Laeddis.

855
01:12:31,232 --> 01:12:34,165
这一切都有关的
That's all it's ever been about.

856
01:12:34,207 --> 01:12:35,883
我是偶然
I was incidental.

857
01:12:37,014 --> 01:12:38,481
进来的
A way in.

858
01:12:41,204 --> 01:12:42,461
乔治?
George?

859
01:12:43,006 --> 01:12:44,346
乔治诺伊斯
George Noyce?

860
01:12:45,185 --> 01:12:48,623
不　不可能　你不可能在这的
No, it's not possible, You can't be here.

861
01:12:48,873 --> 01:12:50,214
你喜欢吗?
Do you like it?

862
01:12:51,891 --> 01:12:53,902
谁把你弄成这样的　乔治　
Who did this to you, George?

863
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,243
你
You did!

864
01:12:55,745 --> 01:12:57,086
你什意思
What the hell do you mean?

865
01:12:57,128 --> 01:12:59,223
你说的是什么意思
What are you talking all of your fucking talk

866
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:01,653
我回来这都是因为你
And I'm back here because of you!

867
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:04,002
乔治　我把你弄出去
George, I how did they get you out of Dedham. Huh?

868
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:07,394
我会想办法弥补的
However this happened, Im gonna find a way to fix this. You understand me?

869
01:13:07,437 --> 01:13:08,820
我再也出不去了
I'll never get out now.

870
01:13:08,861 --> 01:13:11,586
我出去过一次　但没有第二次了
I got out once, But not twice, never twice.

871
01:13:11,627 --> 01:13:14,938
告诉我他们怎么把你弄这来的　他们知道
- Tell me how they got you here? - They knew!

872
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:16,405
你不明白吗
Don't you get it?

873
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,547
你做的一切　你的全部计划
Everything you were up to. Your whole plan.

874
01:13:20,175 --> 01:13:22,564
这是个游戏　这一切
This is a game. All of this...

875
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:24,450
都是为你准备的
is for you.

876
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,670
你不是在调查
You're not investigating anything.

877
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,442
你就是迷宫里的一只小老鼠
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

878
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:31,784
乔治
George...

879
01:13:32,244 --> 01:13:34,338
你错了
Gearge you're wrong.

880
01:13:35,052 --> 01:13:36,309
是么
Really?

881
01:13:36,728 --> 01:13:40,374
你不都一直就一个人吗
Been alone much since you got here?

882
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,594
我有个搭档
I'm been with my partner.

883
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,736
你没和他一起工作过　对么
You have never worked with him before, have you?

884
01:13:46,576 --> 01:13:47,622
他是个
He's a...

885
01:13:48,252 --> 01:13:50,515
从西雅图来的警察
US Marshal from Seattle.

886
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:53,616
但你从没和他一起工作过对吧?
You have never worked with him before, have you?

887
01:13:54,956 --> 01:13:56,171
乔治 听着
George, look...

888
01:13:56,215 --> 01:13:59,650
我了解人们我相信他
I know people. I trust this man.

889
01:14:03,841 --> 01:14:06,396
那么　他们已经赢了
Then, they've already won.

890
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:13,311
该死
Fuck!

891
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:16,536
他们要
They're going to...

892
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:19,052
带我去灯塔
take me to the lighthouse.

893
01:14:19,136 --> 01:14:21,692
他们要扒开我的大脑
They're going to cut into my brain.

894
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:26,086
都是因为你我才在这的
And I'm only here because of you!

895
01:14:26,885 --> 01:14:30,753
乔治!我会把你弄出去的　你不用去灯塔
George, I'm going to get you out of here. You're not going to the lighthouse.

896
01:14:31,113 --> 01:14:31,808
你不可
You're not.

897
01:14:31,983 --> 01:14:34,767
你不可能同时杀掉雷德斯并揭露真相
You can't dig out the truth and kill Laeddis at the same time.

898
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:37,499
你得做个选择　明白吗?
You've got to make a choice. You understand that, don't you?

899
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:40,331
我不是来杀人的
I'm not here to kill anyone.

900
01:14:40,527 --> 01:14:44,950
-骗子　 -我没杀他　我发誓...
- Liar! - I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ...

901
01:14:45,577 --> 01:14:47,674
她死了
She's dead.

902
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:50,481
让她走吧
Let her go...

903
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:51,946
让她走吧
Let her go.

904
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:54,024
泰德　告诉他
Tell him Teddy...

905
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:57,360
告诉他 这是怎么一回事
Tell him why.

906
01:14:59,444 --> 01:15:01,528
你必须这么做,没有别的办法了
You've got to do it. There's no other way.

907
01:15:02,235 --> 01:15:05,273
放她走　你给我拿这些花时...
- Let her go. - Tell him about the day you brought me my locket...

908
01:15:05,812 --> 01:15:06,404
你就该做了
You've gotta do it!

909
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:11,116
我权告诉你　你却伤了我的心　 现在你问我原因?
How I told you my heart was breaking. And you asked me why?

910
01:15:11,157 --> 01:15:12,949
自己想想吧
She's fucking with your head.

911
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:16,201
然后我告诉你它来自于幸福
And I told you it was from happiness.

912
01:15:16,324 --> 01:15:17,785
她要杀你
She'll kill you. She's going to kill you.

913
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,785
你想揭开真相?那么你得让她走
You want to uncover the truth? You've gotta let her go ...

914
01:15:25,212 --> 01:15:28,497
-我不能　 -你必须让她走
- I can't. - You have to let her go!

915
01:15:28,539 --> 01:15:30,413
我不能　我不能
I can't! I can't.

916
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:39,960
那么你永远没法离开这座岛
Then you'll never leave this island.

917
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:46,671
雷德斯
Dolores?

918
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,216
他不在这个病房了
He's not in this ward.

919
01:15:56,841 --> 01:15:58,717
他被移送
He was transferred...

920
01:15:59,174 --> 01:16:00,510
出去了
Out of here.

921
01:16:02,384 --> 01:16:04,385
如果他不在A栋病房
If he's not in ward A,

922
01:16:05,095 --> 01:16:08,011
那只可能在一个地方了.
there's only one place he can be

923
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:14,263
-灯塔
The lighthouse.

924
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:22,893
嘿
Hey!

925
01:16:25,852 --> 01:16:27,186
上帝保佑你
God help you.

926
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:38,731
老大　有麻烦了　考利和麦克弗森到了c栋里
Boss, we got problems. McPherson and Cawley are in the building.

927
01:16:38,773 --> 01:16:41,567
考利听说有个病人被看护殴打
They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,

928
01:16:41,608 --> 01:16:44,400
那人逃到屋顶上　他上去找他了
They're looking all over the place for him. They're on the way to the roof.

929
01:16:44,484 --> 01:16:45,819
我们快离开这
Let's get the hell out of here.

930
01:16:45,861 --> 01:16:46,860
走这边
This way.

931
01:16:48,945 --> 01:16:51,986
-快走　 -镇定点,我们现在是看护
Just keep going. We belong here

932
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:04,826
-你刚怎么了 -什么意思?
- What happened to you? - What do you mean?

933
01:17:05,658 --> 01:17:07,370
你到哪去了?
Where were you?

934
01:17:07,411 --> 01:17:09,660
我们把他这到医务室以后
After we got that guy to the infirmary,

935
01:17:09,703 --> 01:17:11,911
我溜到档案室 翻了一下病人记录
I took a little detour to patient records.

936
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:13,538
你找到雷德斯了吗?
Did you ever find Laeddis?

937
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,621
没有
No.

938
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:18,748
-没,没找到　 -我找到了更好的东西
- No. I never found him. - Well I've got the next best thing.

939
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:20,290
-他的入院登记表
His intake form.

940
01:17:20,332 --> 01:17:23,165
在他的档案夹,没有会议记录,没有事件报告
It was the only thing in his file. No session notes. No incident reports.

941
01:17:23,165 --> 01:17:25,125
没有任何照片　很奇怪
No photographs... just this. It was weird.

942
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:27,002
拿去 你看看
Here, take a look.

943
01:17:27,835 --> 01:17:29,167
待会儿我再看
I'll look at it later.

944
01:17:31,169 --> 01:17:32,335
怎么了 老大
What's the matter, boss?

945
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,337
我只是想等会再看
I'll take a look at it later, that's all.

946
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:39,089
我们应该往那边走
Ashecliffe's that way.

947
01:17:39,214 --> 01:17:41,049
我不去回去监狱那边
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

948
01:17:42,549 --> 01:17:44,089
我要去灯塔
I'm going to the lighthouse.

949
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:47,760
我要搞清楚这岛上到底发生了什么
I'm going to find out what the fuck is happening on this island.

950
01:18:01,263 --> 01:18:02,431
就这里了
Here it is.

951
01:18:03,057 --> 01:18:04,225
该死的
Damn!

952
01:18:05,349 --> 01:18:07,141
太远了　我们得回头
We're too far South. We're gonna have to double back.

953
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,269
没有办法穿过这些岩石
There's no way we could cross those rocks.

954
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:13,187
那些树后面 应该会有路的
There could be a way behind those trees.

955
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:15,018
也许是一条穿过岩石到达灯塔的小路
Maybe a path that goes around the rocks that leads over to the lighthouse.

956
01:18:15,143 --> 01:18:17,978
等等,到底来这干嘛 我们拿到了他的入院登记表
What are we doing here? We've got the intake form.

957
01:18:18,478 --> 01:18:22,022
那证明这里有他们说不存在的67号病人
It proves there's a 67th patient... which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.

958
01:18:24,523 --> 01:18:26,607
我就是要去那个灯塔　你懂吗?
I'm getting to that lighthouse. Do you understand?

959
01:18:29,314 --> 01:18:31,941
我怎么说你才能停下来呢
What the hell can I say to you to stop you?

960
01:18:32,358 --> 01:18:33,401
为何你要阻止我?为什么?
Why would you want to Chuck? Why?

961
01:18:33,484 --> 01:18:38,070
我阻止你是因为天一黑什么看不到.. 这样爬下去跟自杀没什么两样
Because climbing down there when it's dark is a thin step short to suicide. That's why.

962
01:18:38,111 --> 01:18:39,112
好吧
Okay.

963
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:42,655
也许你坐这看着会发生什么事
Maybe you better sit this one out then.

964
01:18:44,237 --> 01:18:47,989
你让我淌这趟浑水　老大　现在我身陷其中,卡在岩壁里了
You brought me into this, boss. And now I am trapped here on this rock.

965
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:48,906
在这岛上
On this island.

966
01:18:49,032 --> 01:18:52,866
这里没人认识我们　你现在像...
Without no one to rely on but eachother. And now you're acting like.........

967
01:18:52,906 --> 01:18:53,907
像什么
Like what? Like what?

968
01:18:53,992 --> 01:18:55,492
我像在演戏吗
How am I acting?

969
01:18:59,453 --> 01:19:03,620
刚在C栋里到底发生了什么　泰德
What the hell happened back there in those cells, Ted?

970
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:13,834
-你觉得波特兰的天气怎样　查克　 -我来自西雅图
- What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck? - I'm from Seattle.

971
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:17,250
西雅图
Seattle?

972
01:19:21,835 --> 01:19:24,670
我要过去 自己过去!
I'll going on...alone.

973
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:27,881
我跟你一起　老大
I'm going with you, boss.

974
01:19:27,923 --> 01:19:29,546
我说了我自己去
I said alone.

975
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,006
好吧
Fine.

976
01:19:58,601 --> 01:19:59,893
该死!
Damn it!

977
01:20:01,018 --> 01:20:02,266
该死
Damn it!

978
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:10,477
我们方位偏差太多 而且我过不去　因为涨潮了
I knew it wouldn't take long. But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.

979
01:20:20,068 --> 01:20:21,233
查克
Chuck!

980
01:20:23,734 --> 01:20:24,985
查克
Chuck!

981
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,051
过来点!
Come on!

982
01:22:03,064 --> 01:22:04,314
查克
Chuck!

983
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:06,483
你在哪　查克
Where are you, Chuck?

984
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,534
查克
Chuck!

985
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:35,661
查克
Chuck!

986
01:23:20,136 --> 01:23:21,429
你是谁
Who are you?

987
01:23:24,012 --> 01:23:25,347
我是泰德丹尼尔
I'm Teddy Daniels.

988
01:23:25,472 --> 01:23:26,512
我是警察
I'm a cop.

989
01:23:27,764 --> 01:23:28,931
你是联邦警察
You're the marshal.

990
01:23:30,892 --> 01:23:32,059
是的
That's right.

991
01:23:34,432 --> 01:23:35,475
你介意
Would you mind...

992
01:23:35,599 --> 01:23:38,392
把手从后面拿出来吗?
taking your hand from behind your back, please?

993
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:39,436
为什么?
Why?

994
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:41,308
为什么?
Why?!

995
01:23:41,937 --> 01:23:44,854
为了确认你手里的东西不会伤害我
I want to make sure what you're holding won't hurt me.

996
01:23:52,274 --> 01:23:53,398
我要拿着...
I'm gonna keep this...

997
01:23:54,857 --> 01:23:56,191
如果你不介意的话
If you don't mind.

998
01:23:57,482 --> 01:23:59,319
我不介意
Fine by me.

999
01:24:11,324 --> 01:24:12,490
你是瑞秋索兰多
You're Rachel Solando.

1000
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,116
真正的那个
The real one.

1001
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,450
你杀了你的孩子们么
Did you kill your children?

1002
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:24,451
我没有孩子
I never had children.

1003
01:24:26,245 --> 01:24:27,370
我没有结过婚
I was never married.

1004
01:24:29,454 --> 01:24:32,914
在成为隔离岛的病人前　我在这工作
And before I was a patient in Ashecliff, I worked here.

1005
01:24:35,065 --> 01:24:36,443
你是护士
You were a nurse?

1006
01:24:38,196 --> 01:24:39,863
我是精神科医生　警官
I was a doctor, marshal.

1007
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,080
你觉得我疯了么
You think I'm crazy?

1008
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:48,333
不　我　如果我说我没疯
- No, I ... - And if I say I'm not crazy ...

1009
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:51,756
但那也是没有用　对吧
well that hardly helps, does it?

1010
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:56,470
那是白痴的想法
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1011
01:24:59,599 --> 01:25:00,851
人们总是告诉你 你疯了
People tell the world you're crazy

1012
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:03,022
就是跟你对立抗争
and all your protests to the contrary,

1013
01:25:03,563 --> 01:25:04,732
要你相信他们说的一切
just confirms what they're saying.

1014
01:25:07,945 --> 01:25:10,030
我没有听懂你说的　很抱歉
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1015
01:25:10,311 --> 01:25:11,699
一旦你承认疯了
Once you are declared insane,

1016
01:25:12,618 --> 01:25:15,370
那你做的一切就是疯了
then anything you do is called a part of that insanity.

1017
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:18,084
不管是理智的抵抗还是否认
Your reasonable protests or denial.

1018
01:25:19,209 --> 01:25:21,422
恐惧还是妄想 你都会被认为你是疯了
Valid fears, paranoia.

1019
01:25:21,422 --> 01:25:23,590
生存的本能
Survival instincts.

1020
01:25:24,218 --> 01:25:25,260
就像自我防御
Defense mechanisms.

1021
01:25:26,003 --> 01:25:28,641
警官,你比看起来精明多了　 但这也许不是件好事
You're smarter than you look marshal. That's probably not a good thing.

1022
01:25:30,326 --> 01:25:31,309
告诉我
Tell me something...

1023
01:25:31,518 --> 01:25:32,686
好的
Yeah...

1024
01:25:34,648 --> 01:25:36,316
你发生了什么
What happened to you?

1025
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:39,863
刚开始我问他们为何要购买运送大量的钠
I started asking about these large shipments of sodium-anatol

1026
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:43,826
含有钠原料的致幻剂　 是治疗精神病的药物
- and opium-based hallucinogens. - Psychotropic drugs.

1027
01:25:45,411 --> 01:25:46,747
我还问了些有关于手术的事情
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1028
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:51,838
有听过前额叶切除手术吗?
Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy?

1029
01:25:53,551 --> 01:25:55,176
他们先用电击疗法控制病人
They zap the patient with electroshocks,

1030
01:25:56,343 --> 01:26:00,223
然后用冰钻穿过眼睛
then go through the eye with an ice pick

1031
01:26:01,351 --> 01:26:03,020
接着挑掉一些神经组织
and pull out some nerve fibers.

1032
01:26:06,149 --> 01:26:07,525
让病人更加听话
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1033
01:26:08,473 --> 01:26:10,447
更好驯服
Tractable.

1034
01:26:11,281 --> 01:26:12,325
太野蛮了
It's barbaric.

1035
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:14,910
太荒谬了
Unconscionable.

1036
01:26:16,162 --> 01:26:20,752
警官, 你知道身体有多痛吗?
Do you know how pain enters the body marshal? Do you?

1037
01:26:21,712 --> 01:26:23,130
那取决于你伤了哪里
Depends on where you're hurt.

1038
01:26:24,089 --> 01:26:25,426
不　跟肉体没关系
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1039
01:26:25,721 --> 01:26:27,429
大脑控制疼痛
The brain controls pain.

1040
01:26:28,589 --> 01:26:32,644
大脑控制着恐惧　情绪　睡眠　生气　饥饿一切
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep, hunger, anger... everything.

1041
01:26:35,363 --> 01:26:36,482
如果你能控制它呢
What If you could control it?

1042
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:38,776
大脑
The brain?

1043
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:40,487
重新创造一个人
Re-create a man,

1044
01:26:41,338 --> 01:26:43,074
那么他将感觉不到疼痛
so he doesn't feel pain,

1045
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,787
或者爱　或是同情
or love, or sympathy.

1046
01:26:47,463 --> 01:26:51,711
一个什么都不会被拷问出来的人　 因为他没有任何记忆去坦白
A man who can't be interrogated because he has no memories to confess.

1047
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,426
他们不可能拿走所有人的记忆
You can never take away all a man's memories.

1048
01:26:56,634 --> 01:26:57,968
永远不可能
Never.

1049
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:01,641
你知道么　北韩在洗脑实验中
Marshal, the North Koreans used American POWs

1050
01:27:02,276 --> 01:27:03,685
使用美国战俘试验
during their brainwashing experiments.

1051
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:06,856
他们把士兵变成叛徒　在这里他们就是这么做的
They turned soldiers into traitors. That's what they are doing here.

1052
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:12,280
神志清楚的人是不会在世上创造鬼怪说
They're creating ghosts to go out in the world. And do things sane men never do.

1053
01:27:12,363 --> 01:27:15,185
那种能力与知识
To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge.

1054
01:27:15,794 --> 01:27:17,305
那需要长时间研究才办得的
That would take years.

1055
01:27:17,581 --> 01:27:21,043
长年的研究 对成百上千病人的实验
Years of research, hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1056
01:27:23,129 --> 01:27:25,465
50年来　人们回头看时
50 years from now, people will look back

1057
01:27:25,655 --> 01:27:28,283
他们会说 一切就是从这开始的
and say, "Here. This place is where it all began."

1058
01:27:29,813 --> 01:27:30,896
纳粹使用犹太人　
The Nazis used the Jews.

1059
01:27:31,249 --> 01:27:34,896
苏联人用古格拉集中营中的犯人 而我们...
The Soviets used prisoners  in their own gulags, and we...

1060
01:27:35,455 --> 01:27:36,813
我们拿病患做实验
We tested patients,

1061
01:27:37,649 --> 01:27:38,775
隔离岛上的病患
on Shutter Island.

1062
01:27:40,111 --> 01:27:43,234
不,他们不会 不
No, they won't ... No

1063
01:27:46,577 --> 01:27:47,745
你其实知道
You do understand

1064
01:27:51,502 --> 01:27:53,586
他们不会让你离开　对吧?
That they can't let you leave?

1065
01:27:54,129 --> 01:27:55,172
我是联邦警察
I am a federal marshal ...

1066
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:57,342
他们不能阻止我
They can't stop me.

1067
01:27:58,803 --> 01:27:59,970
我曾是个受人敬重的精神科医生
I was an esteemed psychiatrist,

1068
01:28:02,133 --> 01:28:04,519
来自一个备受敬仰的医生家族
from a respected family.

1069
01:28:05,562 --> 01:28:07,147
那一点也没有用
It didn't matter.

1070
01:28:09,893 --> 01:28:10,920
我问你
Let me ask you ...

1071
01:28:11,652 --> 01:28:13,323
你曾有过精神创伤吗？
any past traumas in your life?

1072
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,580
有啊　跟这一切有什么关系?
Yes. Why? Why would that matter?

1073
01:28:20,073 --> 01:28:22,043
他们要让你有一个过去的事件
Because they can point to some event in your past and say

1074
01:28:22,084 --> 01:28:24,547
可以推说那是你丧失神智的一部份原因
it is the reason you lost your sanity

1075
01:28:24,997 --> 01:28:26,967
那么当他们把你困在这里时
So that when they commit you here

1076
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:31,348
你的朋友　同事会说... 他突然就这样爆发了
your friends and colleagues will say, "Of course he cracked."

1077
01:28:33,362 --> 01:28:34,759
谁都会这样说
"And who wouldn't have, after what he'd been through."

1078
01:28:34,759 --> 01:28:36,070
你说的可能发生在任何一个人身上
They can say that about anyone

1079
01:28:36,378 --> 01:28:39,400
-任何人都有可能 -重点是他们目前是锁定你
- anyone at all. - The point is they're going to say it about you.

1080
01:28:43,175 --> 01:28:45,241
你的头还好吗？
How's your head?

1081
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:48,996
-我的头？　 -来这后一直作怪梦吗？
- My head? - Any funny dreams lately?

1082
01:28:49,706 --> 01:28:53,877
糟糕的睡眠　头痛
Trouble sleeping? Headaches?

1083
01:28:55,421 --> 01:28:57,216
我可能得了偏头痛
I am prone to migraines. Yes.

1084
01:28:57,258 --> 01:28:58,259
天啊
Jesus!

1085
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:02,556
你没吃他们的药吧?
You haven't taken any pills, have you?

1086
01:29:03,474 --> 01:29:05,913
-连阿司匹灵也没吃吧? -我吃了一片阿司匹灵
- I mean even aspirin? - They hit the aspirin?

1087
01:29:05,913 --> 01:29:07,481
天杀的..
Jesus!

1088
01:29:07,772 --> 01:29:10,985
你有在食堂 喝咖啡或吃了什么吗
And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank coffee they gave you.

1089
01:29:11,485 --> 01:29:13,696
别告诉我你还抽了他们给你的烟
You tell me at least that you've been smoking your own cigarettes.

1090
01:29:16,409 --> 01:29:19,330
不
No... no.

1091
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,041
我都有..
No. I haven't.

1092
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:24,907
神精麻醉剂需要36到48小时
It takes 36 to 48 hours for neuroleptic narcotics

1093
01:29:25,091 --> 01:29:29,343
充分接触血液　然后发挥作用
to reach workable levels in the blood stream.

1094
01:29:29,384 --> 01:29:31,221
先是脉搏
Palsy comes first

1095
01:29:32,263 --> 01:29:34,350
手指　然后所有的身体部位
First the fingertips and then eventually the whole hand.

1096
01:29:36,436 --> 01:29:40,615
警官　你最近做恶梦么
Seen any walking nightmares  lately, marshal? Huh?

1097
01:29:43,195 --> 01:29:44,989
告诉我灯塔里发生了什么
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse?

1098
01:29:46,784 --> 01:29:47,910
告诉我
Tell me.

1099
01:29:49,162 --> 01:29:51,123
大脑手术
Brain surgery.

1100
01:29:51,874 --> 01:29:55,754
就像　打开颅骨看里面怎样
"Let's open the skull and see what happens if we pull on this" kind.

1101
01:29:56,337 --> 01:29:58,674
跟纳粹的手法如出一辙
"We learned it from the Nazi's" kind.

1102
01:30:01,469 --> 01:30:03,264
接着他们创造出来鬼魂
It's where they create the ghosts.

1103
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:06,895
谁知道这事
Who knows about this?

1104
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,314
我是说在岛上　谁
On the island I mean. Who?

1105
01:30:11,775 --> 01:30:13,152
人人都知道
Everyone.

1106
01:30:13,278 --> 01:30:16,699
拜托　护士吗?看护??　
Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1107
01:30:17,741 --> 01:30:20,245
不可能...岛上每个人都心知肚明
- They couldn't possibly know... - Everyone.

1108
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:41,441
你不能再待在这了
You can't stay here.

1109
01:30:41,943 --> 01:30:45,404
他们以为我死了　淹死的　 如果他们来这找你就会发现我
They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid if they come looking for you, they might find me.

1110
01:30:46,448 --> 01:30:47,867
很抱歉　但你得走了
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1111
01:30:55,295 --> 01:30:56,837
我会回来找你的
I'm gonna come back for you.

1112
01:30:57,088 --> 01:31:00,092
我不会在这了　我天天换地方　每晚都是个新地方
I won't be here. I move during the day. new places every night.

1113
01:31:00,134 --> 01:31:02,512
但我可以带你离开这个岛
But I could come get you off of this island.

1114
01:31:02,512 --> 01:31:04,681
我刚才说的 你都没听进去吗?
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1115
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:08,645
只有渡轮可以离开这座岛　他们还控制着渡轮
The only way off the island is the ferry and they control it.

1116
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,939
你永远也无法离开这里
You'll never leave here.

1117
01:31:20,952 --> 01:31:22,329
我有个朋友
I had a friend.

1118
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:25,250
他昨天和我在一起　但我们走散了
I was with him yesterday, but we got separated.

1119
01:31:26,043 --> 01:31:27,627
你有看到他吗?
Have you seen him?

1120
01:31:28,965 --> 01:31:30,549
联邦警察
Marshal...

1121
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:33,804
你没有任何朋友
You have no friends.

1122
01:32:06,557 --> 01:32:08,726
你在这啊
There you are.

1123
01:32:10,687 --> 01:32:13,107
我们正好奇 你到底何时会出现呢
We've been wondering when you'd show up.

1124
01:32:15,068 --> 01:32:16,444
坐吧
Have a seat.

1125
01:32:17,071 --> 01:32:18,322
来吧
Come on.

1126
01:32:29,296 --> 01:32:31,674
在隔离岛散步的怎样?
Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we?

1127
01:32:32,924 --> 01:32:34,386
我
I was just...

1128
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:36,473
只是在四处转转
just looking around.

1129
01:32:39,184 --> 01:32:41,272
享受上帝刚给的礼物吗?
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1130
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,025
什么　上帝的礼物
- What? - God's gift.

1131
01:32:46,611 --> 01:32:48,154
暴力
The violence.

1132
01:32:53,037 --> 01:32:56,500
当我从家里楼上下来看见横躺在客厅的大树时
When I came downstairs in my home and I saw that tree in my living room,

1133
01:32:57,542 --> 01:32:59,630
就像是上帝把手伸到我面前一样
it reached down for me like a divine hand.

1134
01:33:01,298 --> 01:33:03,051
上帝喜欢暴力
God loves violence.

1135
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:08,892
-我没注意　 -你当然注意到了
- I hadn't noticed. - Sure you have.

1136
01:33:09,558 --> 01:33:11,312
不然会有这么多暴力呢
Why else would there be so much of it?

1137
01:33:12,147 --> 01:33:13,608
就在我们中间
It's in us.

1138
01:33:13,815 --> 01:33:15,068
这就是人性啊
It's what we are.

1139
01:33:16,861 --> 01:33:20,198
我们发动战争　四处放火抢劫
We wage war, we burn sacrifices, we pillage and plunder

1140
01:33:20,282 --> 01:33:21,908
然后处理兄弟的遣体
and tear at the flesh of our brothers

1141
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:25,914
为什么　因为上帝以他的名义让我们发起暴力
and why? Because God gave us violence to wage in his honor.

1142
01:33:29,254 --> 01:33:31,506
我以为上帝给我们是道德的指令
I thought God gave us moral order.

1143
01:33:31,548 --> 01:33:34,258
没有像这飓风一样纯粹的道德指令
There is no moral order as pure as this storm.

1144
01:33:35,178 --> 01:33:37,263
根本没有道德的指令
There's no moral order at all.

1145
01:33:37,723 --> 01:33:41,353
仅有的是　我的暴力能否战胜你的
There's just this: can my violence conquer yours?

1146
01:33:46,986 --> 01:33:48,864
-我不暴力　 -不,你是暴力份子
- I'm not violent. - Yes you are.

1147
01:33:50,532 --> 01:33:52,409
你和他们一样
You're as violent as they come.

1148
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,373
我会知道是因为 我也和他们一样
I know this because I'm as violent as they come.

1149
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,377
来自我们构造的幻想世界
With the constraints of society, we are lifted and

1150
01:33:59,711 --> 01:34:04,718
如果我跟你的食物站在一起 你会用石头敲碎我的脑壳 然后抢走我的食物
If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.

1151
01:34:07,556 --> 01:34:09,100
可怜的你
Wouldn't you?

1152
01:34:11,894 --> 01:34:15,690
考利觉得你没有威胁　你可以被控制　 但我知道你不一样
Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be controlled, but I know different.

1153
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:20,990
-你并不了解我　 -我其实一清二楚
- You don't know me. - Oh but I do. Oh I know you.

1154
01:34:22,033 --> 01:34:24,203
我们彼此了解了几个世纪了
We've known each other for centuries.

1155
01:34:34,134 --> 01:34:36,845
如果现在我把牙齿插入你的眼睛
If I was to sink my teeth into your eye right now,

1156
01:34:36,887 --> 01:34:40,183
你能在我把你弄瞎前阻止我吗?
would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?

1157
01:34:44,356 --> 01:34:45,941
你敢的话就试试看
Give it a try.

1158
01:34:47,483 --> 01:34:51,658
就是这种精神
That's the spirit.

1159
01:35:36,718 --> 01:35:38,262
你去哪了
Where have you been?

1160
01:35:39,431 --> 01:35:41,601
瞎逛四处看看你的岛
Wandering, just looking at your island.

1161
01:35:41,726 --> 01:35:46,022
你该走了　瑞秋找到了
Oh I forgot. You're leaving. Now that Rachel has been found.

1162
01:35:46,524 --> 01:35:47,984
当然
Sure. Yeah.

1163
01:35:50,279 --> 01:35:51,531
大会议
Big meeting?

1164
01:35:52,155 --> 01:35:54,659
哦　是的
Oh, yes ...

1165
01:35:54,743 --> 01:35:57,372
显然昨天C栋病房混进一个身份不明的人
Apparently there was an unidentified man in ward C yesterday

1166
01:35:57,414 --> 01:36:00,919
他空手制服了一个危险的病人
He subdued a highly dangerous patient. Quite handily.

1167
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:03,212
然后呢
Is that so?

1168
01:36:03,337 --> 01:36:07,928
似乎他和一个偏执狂　 精神病患者聊了很久　乔治诺伊斯
It seems he had a long conversation with a paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

1169
01:36:11,056 --> 01:36:13,936
这个诺伊斯你说他的名字是
This Noyce, you said his name was,

1170
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:18,067
他是偏执狂　是么　哦　是的 他很不安
- he's delusional? - Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1171
01:36:18,108 --> 01:36:21,238
事实上　两周前　一个病人
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient got so wound up

1172
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,202
在伊斯的楼层晃了太久 被他吃掉了
by one of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1173
01:36:25,535 --> 01:36:27,121
抽烟吗?
Cigarette?

1174
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,333
不　谢谢　我戒了
Oh. No, thanks. I quit.

1175
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:34,088
那么　你要搭渡轮么
So, you're taking the ferry?

1176
01:36:34,715 --> 01:36:36,092
当然
Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh...

1177
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,594
我想我们已经得到了需要的一切
I think we've gotten all we came here for so.

1178
01:36:39,512 --> 01:36:40,681
你说"我们"　联邦警察?
"We" marshal?

1179
01:36:42,934 --> 01:36:44,644
既然你提到,
Speaking of which. Have you

1180
01:36:45,145 --> 01:36:47,566
-你看见他了吗,医生?　 -谁?
- seen him, Doctor? - Who?

1181
01:36:48,483 --> 01:36:50,069
我的搭档　查克
My partner, Chuck.

1182
01:36:52,865 --> 01:36:54,867
你哪来的搭档　警官　你自己来的
You don't have a partner, Marshal. You came here alone.

1183
01:36:57,454 --> 01:37:00,041
你知道吗? 我建造了一些有价值的东西
You know, I've built something valuable here.

1184
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:03,587
但是有价值的东西 在他们那个时代总是被误解
And valuable things have a way of being misunderstood in their own time.

1185
01:37:03,712 --> 01:37:05,672
人人都想快点好起来　他们总是那样
Everyone wants a quick fix, they always have.

1186
01:37:05,798 --> 01:37:09,345
我试着做一些人们甚至是你也不理解的
I'm trying to do something that people, yourself included, don't understand.

1187
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,933
没经过奋战 我是不会放弃的
And I'm not going to give up without a fight.

1188
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:15,937
我知道
I can see that...

1189
01:37:19,775 --> 01:37:21,653
那你刚提到你的搭档?
So tell me again about your partner.

1190
01:37:23,615 --> 01:37:25,534
什么搭档?
What partner?

1191
01:38:30,582 --> 01:38:32,292
警官
Marshal...

1192
01:38:33,628 --> 01:38:35,088
你要到哪去呢?
Going somewhere?

1193
01:38:35,588 --> 01:38:39,260
我要往那去码头搭渡轮
No. Just heading out to the ferry. So...

1194
01:38:40,929 --> 01:38:42,597
码头在另外一头才对
I'm afraid it's the other way.

1195
01:38:45,643 --> 01:38:47,521
你稍等下
If you wait a moment,

1196
01:38:48,106 --> 01:38:51,068
我找人带你去码头
I'll find someone who can take you to the dock.

1197
01:38:54,905 --> 01:38:57,451
这是什么　医生
What is this, doctor?

1198
01:38:57,493 --> 01:39:00,036
只是镇静剂
It's just a sedative.

1199
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:02,749
-以防万一的　 -以防万一?
- It's for precaution. - Precaution?

1200
01:39:05,253 --> 01:39:09,509
你要干嘛　杀了我吗?
What are you going to do? Kill me? Marshal.

1201
01:39:10,051 --> 01:39:11,386
你值得我这么做吗?
You think you deserve it?

1202
01:39:11,887 --> 01:39:14,725
什么?　激怒你?
For what? For provoking you?

1203
01:39:15,266 --> 01:39:17,854
请原谅我,但现在不是任何事都可以激怒你?
and, forgive me, what doesn't provoke you?

1204
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:19,439
谈论
Remarks...

1205
01:39:19,857 --> 01:39:21,276
-字词　 -纳粹
- Words... - Nazis!

1206
01:39:22,152 --> 01:39:23,696
也是
Well that, too.

1207
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:25,991
当然　也包括 记忆　梦
And of course, memories, dreams...

1208
01:39:27,242 --> 01:39:31,330
你知道么外伤一词来自希腊文
Did you know that the word "trauma" comes from the Greek for "wound"?

1209
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:36,087
德语中的梦叫做　梦境
And what is the German word for "dream" "Traumen".

1210
01:39:36,128 --> 01:39:37,254
梦境　梦
Traumen.

1211
01:39:38,633 --> 01:39:41,428
伤口可以造出怪兽
Wounds can create monsters.

1212
01:39:41,762 --> 01:39:44,350
然而你　你受伤了,警官
And you ... you are wounded, marshal.

1213
01:39:45,392 --> 01:39:48,313
我知道你同意　当你看见怪兽时
Wouldn't you agree, when you see a monster

1214
01:39:49,146 --> 01:39:50,607
你必须停下来
you must stop it?

1215
01:39:53,736 --> 01:39:55,822
-我同意　 -是的
- I agree. - Yes...

1216
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:44,221
你在干麻,宝贝?
What are you doing, baby?

1217
01:40:49,564 --> 01:40:51,189
你该去搭渡轮了
You've got to get to the ferry.

1218
01:40:51,857 --> 01:40:54,026
不　不
No. No. No.

1219
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:02,163
如果人们认为查克死了， 那他将成为他们的试验品
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead, then he is perfect for their experiments.

1220
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:05,376
他们只会带他到一个地方
There's only one place they'd take him.

1221
01:41:08,005 --> 01:41:10,507
你如果去了灯塔　你也会死
You go there and you'll die.

1222
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:14,596
他是我搭档, 我必须去救他
He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out.

1223
01:41:14,973 --> 01:41:17,058
我不能再失去任何人了
I can't lose anyone else.

1224
01:41:17,726 --> 01:41:21,898
别去那　别去　泰德
Don't go, Teddy. Please don't do this. Don't go.

1225
01:41:24,902 --> 01:41:26,863
抱歉　宝贝
I'm sorry, honey.

1226
01:41:28,658 --> 01:41:31,369
我喜欢这条领带　 因为是你买给我的
I love this thing because you gave it to me

1227
01:41:34,164 --> 01:41:36,168
但事实是
But the truth is ...

1228
01:41:36,252 --> 01:41:39,297
这领带实在丑到爆
it's one fucking ugly tie.

1229
01:42:19,769 --> 01:42:20,938
不
No!

1230
01:43:42,799 --> 01:43:44,677
别动　待着别动
Don't move! Stay where you are!

1231
01:43:46,346 --> 01:43:48,014
你要杀了我吗？
Are you going to kill me?

1232
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:52,521
不 我不会杀你
No. I'm not gonna kill you.

1233
01:45:44,756 --> 01:45:47,635
你为何湿透了,宝贝？
Why are you all wet, baby?

1234
01:45:48,803 --> 01:45:51,307
-你说什么？ -你知道我在说什么
- What did you say? - You know exactly what I said.

1235
01:46:04,783 --> 01:46:07,246
顺带一提　那枪没子弹
The rifle's empty by the way.

1236
01:46:12,919 --> 01:46:14,797
请坐
Have a seat.

1237
01:46:21,556 --> 01:46:24,771
把衣服换下来吧　你会感冒的
For god's sake dry off you're going to catch a cold.

1238
01:46:25,938 --> 01:46:26,980
好吧
Alright.

1239
01:46:29,693 --> 01:46:32,488
你把警卫打得很严重吗？
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1240
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,411
我不明白你的意思
I don't know what you're talking about.

1241
01:46:40,249 --> 01:46:41,876
是的　他在这
Yes. He's here.

1242
01:46:42,418 --> 01:46:45,463
送他送上来前 希恩医生有看过他了吗?
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look at your man before you send him up.

1243
01:46:47,217 --> 01:46:49,095
那么　希恩医生
So, Dr. Shehan...

1244
01:46:49,719 --> 01:46:50,972
今早搭了渡轮来这?
He came on the ferry this morning, huh?

1245
01:46:52,015 --> 01:46:53,057
没有
Not exactly.

1246
01:46:54,851 --> 01:46:57,439
你炸了我的汽车　我真的很爱那辆车
You blew up my car. I really loved that car.

1247
01:46:58,815 --> 01:47:00,568
很抱歉
Sorry to hear about that.

1248
01:47:04,032 --> 01:47:05,658
你颤抖的情况更加严重了
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1249
01:47:07,066 --> 01:47:08,193
幻觉的状况呢
How are the hallucinations?

1250
01:47:09,238 --> 01:47:10,698
走吧　泰德
Get out of here, Teddy.

1251
01:47:11,949 --> 01:47:13,829
你会死在这里的
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1252
01:47:16,879 --> 01:47:19,676
-没那么糟　 -明明都又变糟了
- Not bad. - They'll get worse.

1253
01:47:20,177 --> 01:47:21,263
我知道
I know.

1254
01:47:22,182 --> 01:47:23,643
索兰多医生
Dr. Solando...

1255
01:47:24,602 --> 01:47:27,066
告诉我关于神经幻觉的事情
she told me about neuroleptics.

1256
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:30,532
她知道? 什么时候的事?
Did she now? And when was this?

1257
01:47:30,657 --> 01:47:35,626
我找到了她　在峭壁的山洞里　但你抓不到她
I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs. But you'll never get to her.

1258
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,338
我不怀疑
I don't doubt it.

1259
01:47:37,963 --> 01:47:39,798
你想的那些不是真的
Considering she's not real.

1260
01:47:41,385 --> 01:47:43,892
但是你的幻觉 比我估算的还严重
But your hallucinations are more severe than I thought.

1261
01:47:45,435 --> 01:47:47,442
你没有吃精神松弛剂
You are not on neuroleptics.

1262
01:47:48,485 --> 01:47:50,904
事实上你没有服用精神松弛剂
You are not on anything as a matter of fact.

1263
01:47:50,904 --> 01:47:53,286
那这是什么 这是什么
Then what the fuck is this? Huh, what the fuck is this?

1264
01:47:53,411 --> 01:47:54,455
后遗症
Withdrawal.

1265
01:47:54,747 --> 01:47:56,001
后遗症　
Withdrawal?

1266
01:47:56,419 --> 01:47:59,340
什么后遗症　来这个岛上以后我连酒都没喝过
From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned drink since I've been on this island.

1267
01:47:59,382 --> 01:48:00,717
精神病药物
Chlorpromazine.

1268
01:48:01,093 --> 01:48:04,893
我不是药理学的专家　但是看了你的病例
I'm not a fan of pharmacology but I have to say in your case ...

1269
01:48:05,811 --> 01:48:08,192
精神..　 你说那是什么　精神病药物
- Clorpro... what? - Chlorpromazine.

1270
01:48:08,944 --> 01:48:13,535
跟过去的两年 我们开给你的药一样
The same thing we've been  giving you for the past 24 months.

1271
01:48:14,997 --> 01:48:16,326
所以过去的两年
So for the past two years

1272
01:48:16,515 --> 01:48:20,215
你们安排人偷偷再在波士顿给我下药？
you've had somebody slipping me drugs in Boston. Is that it?

1273
01:48:20,257 --> 01:48:22,639
不是波士顿 是这里
Not Boston. Here.

1274
01:48:23,683 --> 01:48:28,149
你已经在这两年了　 你是这里的病患
You've been here for two years. A patient of this institution.

1275
01:48:30,947 --> 01:48:35,038
医生　看过这里的一切以后
After everything I seen here, doctor,

1276
01:48:35,539 --> 01:48:38,088
你认为你能说服我　 我疯了吗?
you really think you're gonna convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1277
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:42,554
你知道我们对付的是怎样的人吗？ 我可是美国联邦警察
Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday? I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake.

1278
01:48:43,097 --> 01:48:46,896
你曾是美国联邦警察 这有一份你的入院申请表的副本
You were a U.S. marshal. Here's a copy of the intake form.

1279
01:48:46,937 --> 01:48:50,277
你闯入C栋病房 为了证明67号病人
You broke into ward C for proof of the 67th patient

1280
01:48:50,402 --> 01:48:53,408
如果你回到大陆　你会炸了这里
If you'd gotten it to the mainland, you could have blown the lid off this place.

1281
01:48:53,951 --> 01:48:55,290
等等　但是
- Wait... wait. - But somehow

1282
01:48:55,373 --> 01:48:57,169
你还没时间亲眼看看这　看看吧
you couldn't find time to look at it. Well read it now.

1283
01:48:58,419 --> 01:48:59,671
拿去看
Go ahead.

1284
01:49:03,513 --> 01:49:05,725
病人极度聪明　极度的错觉症
The patient is highly intelligent, highly delusional.

1285
01:49:05,811 --> 01:49:07,313
幻觉常是军队老兵装扮
Decorated army veteran.

1286
01:49:07,897 --> 01:49:10,297
因参与达卡夫解放战役而被监禁
Present for the liberation of Dakau.

1287
01:49:11,315 --> 01:49:13,007
前美国联邦警察
Former U.S. marshal.

1288
01:49:13,215 --> 01:49:14,286
有暴力倾向
Known proclivity for violence.

1289
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:16,166
对罪责没有任何悔恨
Shows no remorse for his crime  because he denies

1290
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:19,712
因为他否认他犯过罪
that the crime ever took place. Highly developed and fantastical

1291
01:49:19,754 --> 01:49:23,053
建构完整复杂的故事剧情 阻碍他 面对自己行为的真相
narratives which preclude facing the truth of his actions.

1292
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:24,308
我不想看这些狗屁
I've had enough of this bullshit.

1293
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:25,766
我的搭档在哪
Where's my partner, huh?

1294
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:27,435
查克在哪　他在哪
Where's Chuck? Where is he?

1295
01:49:28,325 --> 01:49:29,746
我们试试别的方法吧
Let's try this another way.

1296
01:49:30,163 --> 01:49:32,867
你妻子的小名字叫　 恰娜　对吗？
Your wife's maiden name was "Chanal". Am I correct?

1297
01:49:32,867 --> 01:49:35,495
别提到她　很抱歉我必须这么做
- Don't you even talk about her! - I'm afraid I have to.

1298
01:49:37,248 --> 01:49:40,254
注意这四个名字 有相同的地方吗？
Notice anything these four names have in common?

1299
01:49:40,798 --> 01:49:41,925
规则4
Your rule of 4.

1300
01:49:42,467 --> 01:49:44,973
安德鲁你看到了什么　如果你
- Andrew, what do you see? - If you have done anything

1301
01:49:45,057 --> 01:49:49,232
-对我搭档做了什么 医生 这是侵害人权的事 -注意点　安德鲁你看到了什么
- to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ... - Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

1302
01:49:49,984 --> 01:49:52,488
这些名字　有同样的字母
The names ... have the same letters.

1303
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:55,120
爱德华　丹尼尔和
Edward Daniels has exactly the same 13 letters

1304
01:49:55,204 --> 01:49:57,791
安德鲁雷德斯　有同样的13个字母　瑞秋和索兰多也是
as Andrew Laeddis. The same as Rachel Solando

1305
01:49:57,833 --> 01:49:59,465
还有多洛雷斯陈　所有的名字
and Dolores Chanal. 

1306
01:49:59,669 --> 01:50:01,185
-都是字母顺序的变异 -你唬不了我的
- The names are anagrams for each other.

1307
01:50:01,651 --> 01:50:04,890
对我无效
Your tactics, they're not going to work on me.

1308
01:50:04,932 --> 01:50:07,311
你来这里找出真相　这就是真相
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1309
01:50:07,519 --> 01:50:09,191
你叫安德鲁雷德斯
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1310
01:50:09,482 --> 01:50:13,281
隔离岛的67号病人就是你　安德鲁
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe is you, Andrew.

1311
01:50:14,926 --> 01:50:15,719
胡扯
Bullshit.

1312
01:50:15,743 --> 01:50:18,291
两年前你被法院判刑到这里
You were committed here by court order 24 months ago.

1313
01:50:18,376 --> 01:50:21,715
你犯的罪很可怕 你无法原谅自己
Your crime is terrible. One you can't forgive yourself for.

1314
01:50:21,756 --> 01:50:23,595
于是你创造了另一个自己
So you invented another self.

1315
01:50:28,688 --> 01:50:29,857
给我回到现实世界
Let's get down to the facts.

1316
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:34,049
你创造了一个没有被杀死的故事
You've created a story in which you're not a murderer, you are hero.

1317
01:50:34,429 --> 01:50:35,283
你是美国联邦警察
Still a U.S marshal.

1318
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:37,916
在这隔离岛　侦办一个案子
Only here at Ashecliffe because of a case

1319
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:39,584
你想揭露了其中阴谋
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1320
01:50:40,003 --> 01:50:42,466
所以我们告诉你的真相 你是谁 你做了什么
so that anything we tell you about who you are, what you've done

1321
01:50:43,135 --> 01:50:44,954
不管说什么你都认为是个谎言　安德鲁
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1322
01:50:45,152 --> 01:50:46,505
我叫爱德华丹尼尔
My name is Edward Daniels.

1323
01:50:46,659 --> 01:50:50,441
我两年来一直听你说这奇特的故事 所以我知道一切细节
I've been hearing this fantasy for two years now. I know every detail.

1324
01:50:50,816 --> 01:50:53,321
67号病人 飓风 瑞秋索兰多
Patient 67. The storm. Rachel Solando.

1325
01:50:53,447 --> 01:50:56,078
你走失的搭档　每晚都做的梦
Your missing partner. The dreams you have every night.

1326
01:50:56,078 --> 01:50:58,542
你是去过达卡夫　但不可能杀了所有的纳粹警卫
You were at Dakau, But you may not have killed any guards.

1327
01:51:02,632 --> 01:51:05,639
我希望我能让你活在你幻想的虚构世界里
I wish I could let you just live in your fantasy world.

1328
01:51:06,182 --> 01:51:07,433
我真的想那样
I really do.

1329
01:51:07,934 --> 01:51:12,780
但是你太暴力　受过训练　太危险 你是这里最危险的病人
But you're violent, trained, dangerous. You're the most dangerous patient we have.

1330
01:51:13,155 --> 01:51:15,700
你伤害了所有的警卫　其它病人
You've injured orderlies. Guards. Other patients.

1331
01:51:15,784 --> 01:51:18,373
两周前　你袭击了乔治诺伊斯
Two weeks ago you attacked George Noyce.

1332
01:51:18,415 --> 01:51:19,958
我没做那些
No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor!

1333
01:51:20,168 --> 01:51:22,048
你...我当然没有
- You had Noyce beaten. - Of course I didn't.

1334
01:51:22,256 --> 01:51:24,343
你给我个我会攻击他的理由
Give me one reason why I would even touch him.

1335
01:51:24,468 --> 01:51:26,348
因为他叫你雷德斯
Because he called you Laeddis

1336
01:51:26,432 --> 01:51:28,726
你做了一切事情 让你不要变成他
and you do anything not to be him.

1337
01:51:30,107 --> 01:51:32,694
我这有你昨天和诺伊斯谈话的记录
I have a transcript of that conversation you had with Noyce yesterday.

1338
01:51:32,735 --> 01:51:37,079
关于你和雷德斯　这就是关于那些的一切
This is about you and Laeddis. That's all it's ever been about

1339
01:51:39,292 --> 01:51:41,877
这上面写的是关于　我和雷德斯
No. No. He is saying that it's about "me and Laeddis".

1340
01:51:41,919 --> 01:51:44,469
你问他 他的脸怎么了的时候
When you've asked him what happened to his face,

1341
01:51:44,511 --> 01:51:46,891
说　指出来给你看 他说，你做的
said, and I quote again, "You did this".

1342
01:51:47,432 --> 01:51:50,982
-他的意思是这是我的错　 -你差点杀了他
- No. He meant it was my fault he... - You almost killed him.

1343
01:51:53,446 --> 01:51:57,243
典狱长和这监狱的管理委员会已经做了决定
The warden and the board of overseers are determined something be done. It's been decided.

1344
01:51:58,164 --> 01:52:02,212
除非我们能让你变回正常
That unless, we can bring you back  to sanity now, right now,

1345
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,887
他们将要采取永久性道德措施 保证你不会再伤害任何人
permanent measures will be taken to ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1346
01:52:09,770 --> 01:52:12,067
他们要弄死你　安德鲁
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.

1347
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:13,611
你懂吗
Do you understand?

1348
01:52:17,661 --> 01:52:18,913
是的　我明白
Yeah, I understand.

1349
01:52:19,875 --> 01:52:21,836
我明白　很好
I understand just fine.

1350
01:52:23,088 --> 01:52:27,140
如果我没有在这和你玩游戏
If... if I don't play along with your little game here.

1351
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,811
纳林医生就会把我变成他的鬼魂了
Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into one of his ghosts.

1352
01:52:29,894 --> 01:52:31,482
我的搭档呢
What about my partner?

1353
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:36,492
你的意思我是美国联邦警察 我一厢情愿的自我反射
You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office that he's a defense mechanism?

1354
01:52:38,581 --> 01:52:39,831
哈噜 老大
Hello, boss.

1355
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:01,417
这怎么回事？
What the fuck is going on here?

1356
01:53:04,632 --> 01:53:06,219
你为他工作
You working for him?

1357
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:11,856
我很抱歉必须有人和你在一起　确保你的安全
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way. Someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe.

1358
01:53:14,027 --> 01:53:15,947
你一直在监视我是吗？
You've been watching me, huh?

1359
01:53:16,657 --> 01:53:18,536
监视我一分一秒
Watching me every minute.

1360
01:53:20,415 --> 01:53:21,791
你是谁
Who... who are you?

1361
01:53:22,207 --> 01:53:23,545
你是谁　告诉我
Who are you? Tell me.

1362
01:53:24,088 --> 01:53:25,844
你不认识我吗？ 安德鲁
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1363
01:53:27,723 --> 01:53:30,350
我是你过去两年的精神科主治医生
I've been you primary psychiatrist for the last two years.

1364
01:53:31,687 --> 01:53:33,150
我是莱斯特　希恩
I am Lester Sheehan.

1365
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:41,917
我告诉过你　关于我的妻子
And I told you about my wife ...

1366
01:53:42,126 --> 01:53:45,258
我知道　我爬到峭壁上去救你
- I know. - I climbed down a cliff to get you.

1367
01:53:45,611 --> 01:53:50,101
我相信你我冒着一切危险跟着你　一切危险
I trusted you. I risked everything  to come in here after you. Everything!

1368
01:53:50,183 --> 01:53:51,269
我知道　老大
I know, boss.

1369
01:53:51,311 --> 01:53:52,982
我们没时间了　安德鲁
We're running out of time here, Andrew,

1370
01:53:54,443 --> 01:53:57,029
我在全体海外委员会面前发誓
I swore before the board of overseers that I could construct

1371
01:53:57,071 --> 01:53:59,580
我会建立一个精神病学历史上最基础的角色扮演模型
the most radical, cutting edge role-play

1372
01:53:59,662 --> 01:54:02,251
那将会把你恢复正常
ever attempted in psychiatry and it would bring you back.

1373
01:54:02,292 --> 01:54:04,882
我想如果我们让你按照你虚构的故事演出来
I thought if we let you play this out

1374
01:54:05,632 --> 01:54:08,638
我们就能让你看到这是多么不真实不可思议
we could get you to see how untrue, how impossible it is.

1375
01:54:10,122 --> 01:54:11,770
我们已经准备那个地方两天了
You've had to run of the place for two days.

1376
01:54:12,482 --> 01:54:15,317
告诉我　纳粹的实验在哪
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?

1377
01:54:16,277 --> 01:54:18,033
那个穷凶极恶的脑部手术实验
The satanic O.R.'s?

1378
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:32,981
安德鲁　听我说
Andrew, listen to me.

1379
01:54:35,444 --> 01:54:37,030
如果我们在你身上付出失败了
If we fail with you

1380
01:54:38,283 --> 01:54:40,579
那么我们在这里所努力的一切就会被质疑
then everything we've tried to do here will be discredited.

1381
01:54:40,704 --> 01:54:41,832
一切
Everything.

1382
01:54:44,253 --> 01:54:46,507
我们脑袋里都面临着战争　安德鲁
We are on the front line of a war here, old boy.

1383
01:54:48,093 --> 01:54:50,515
现在　你也将面临它
And right now, it'll come down to you.

1384
01:54:57,488 --> 01:54:59,576
别动
Don't move! Don't move!

1385
01:54:59,659 --> 01:55:02,791
安德鲁　不要　我叫泰德丹尼尔
- Andrew, no! - My name is Edward Daniels.

1386
01:55:03,751 --> 01:55:06,590
我可以从重量知道这是把有子弹的真枪
This one is loaded. I can tell by the weight.

1387
01:55:06,674 --> 01:55:08,763
我知道了　那是联邦警察的枪　你确定吗
I see. And that's your firearm marshal? You're sure?

1388
01:55:09,303 --> 01:55:10,849
枪管有个缺角痕迹...那天菲利苦斯德克就开这把枪射我
My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1389
01:55:10,933 --> 01:55:15,234
子弹反弹造成的.. 你们不能混乱我的思维
You're not going to fuck with my mind on this one Doc

1390
01:55:15,275 --> 01:55:18,364
然后炸开了　因为那是你们能离开岛的唯一途径
Then blast away, because that's the only way you're ever getting off this island.

1391
01:55:25,253 --> 01:55:26,714
安德鲁　请不要这样
Andrew, please don't.

1392
01:55:37,904 --> 01:55:38,947
我的枪
My gun...

1393
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:47,717
你把我的枪怎么了
What have you done to my Goddamn gun.

1394
01:55:48,845 --> 01:55:50,388
那是个玩具　安德鲁
It's a toy, Andrew.

1395
01:55:53,226 --> 01:55:54,815
我们在告诉你真相
We're telling you the truth.

1396
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:59,701
你老婆 多洛雷斯疯了　精神沮丧　自杀身亡了
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive. Suicidal.

1397
01:56:00,202 --> 01:56:03,415
你喝多了　在旁边　忘掉人们告诉你的一切
You drank. Stayed away. Ignored what everyone had told you.

1398
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:06,463
你去了她那个湖后面的房子
You moved to that lake house after she, purposely,

1399
01:56:06,588 --> 01:56:09,221
故意把你在你公寓纵火
set your city apartment on fire

1400
01:56:09,388 --> 01:56:11,098
安德鲁　安德鲁　停下来
Andrew! Andrew! Stop it!

1401
01:56:13,394 --> 01:56:14,438
你撒谎
You're lying...

1402
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,692
这是你的孩子们
Andrew, your children.

1403
01:56:17,568 --> 01:56:18,781
瑟琳娜
Simon...

1404
01:56:19,742 --> 01:56:22,455
-亨利　 -我没有孩子
- Henry... - I didn't have any children.

1405
01:56:22,664 --> 01:56:24,123
你妻子亲手把他们溺死
Your wife drowned them.

1406
01:56:24,542 --> 01:56:27,130
就在湖边的小屋中
At the cabin by the lake.

1407
01:56:27,255 --> 01:56:29,428
这里　这个小女孩　你
And here, the little girl, the one you dream of

1408
01:56:30,094 --> 01:56:31,221
每晚都梦见的
every night.

1409
01:56:31,973 --> 01:56:33,184
我没有女儿
I never had a little.

1410
01:56:33,226 --> 01:56:37,275
她一遍一遍的告诉你要救她
The one who tells you over and over that you should have saved her

1411
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:38,529
救他们
Saved them all.

1412
01:56:39,155 --> 01:56:40,323
你的女儿
Your daughter...

1413
01:56:40,825 --> 01:56:43,830
她叫瑞秋　你要否认她曾经活着吗？
Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny that she ever lived?

1414
01:56:45,126 --> 01:56:46,252
安德鲁　你否认吗？
Andrew, are you?

1415
01:57:09,602 --> 01:57:11,066
对不起　宝贝
I'm so sorry, baby...

1416
01:57:15,672 --> 01:57:17,555
我告诉过你 不要到这里来的
I told you not to come in here.

1417
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:19,521
我告诉你的
I told you...

1418
01:57:20,401 --> 01:57:22,787
现在你会死在这里的
this would be the end of you.

1419
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,202
我回来了　我们终于抓到他了
I'm back.

1420
01:57:45,573 --> 01:57:49,535
就在俄克拉荷马州
We got him just outside of Oklahoma. Must of stopped ten places

1421
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,662
追他我至少跑了十个地方　 我可以睡上一整个礼拜
in between here and Tulsa. I could sleep for a week.

1422
01:57:56,773 --> 01:57:57,593
多洛雷斯
Dolores?

1423
01:58:04,722 --> 01:58:06,453
多洛雷斯
Dolores?

1424
01:58:13,565 --> 01:58:14,454
多洛雷斯
Dolores?

1425
01:58:29,015 --> 01:58:29,871
多洛雷斯
Dolores?

1426
01:58:55,238 --> 01:58:56,454
亲爱的
Baby...

1427
01:58:58,698 --> 01:59:00,132
你怎么浑身都是湿透了？
Why are you all wet?

1428
01:59:03,025 --> 01:59:04,489
我好想你
I missed you.

1429
01:59:11,395 --> 01:59:14,533
我想回家
I want to go home.

1430
01:59:17,089 --> 01:59:17,900
你就在家呀
You are home!

1431
01:59:23,777 --> 01:59:24,854
孩子们呢
Where are the kids?

1432
01:59:29,182 --> 01:59:31,568
在学校呢
They're in school.

1433
01:59:35,375 --> 01:59:37,470
今天星期六　亲爱的
It's Saturday, honey.

1434
01:59:37,973 --> 01:59:39,937
星期六不上学的
School's not in on Saturday.

1435
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:44,543
我的学校是要上课的
My school is.

1436
01:59:57,978 --> 02:00:00,069
哦　天啊
Oh my God!

1437
02:00:02,539 --> 02:00:03,920
天
My God!

1438
02:00:18,444 --> 02:00:20,368
上帝
God!

1439
02:00:23,171 --> 02:00:26,645
哦　上帝　不要
Oh my God, no!

1440
02:00:29,452 --> 02:00:31,125
醒过来　醒过来
Come on! Come on!

1441
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:51,842
求求你　上帝　不要
Please, God, no.

1442
02:00:51,926 --> 02:00:55,608
不
No!

1443
02:00:56,447 --> 02:00:57,702
不
No!

1444
02:01:03,351 --> 02:01:04,523
不
No!

1445
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:08,081
不
No!

1446
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:14,375
把他们放厨房桌上吧
Let's put them in the room.

1447
02:02:15,256 --> 02:02:17,640
烘干他们
We'll dry them off...

1448
02:02:18,186 --> 02:02:19,860
帮他们换件衣服
We'll change their clothes...

1449
02:02:21,699 --> 02:02:25,049
他们就是我们活的玩偶了
They'll be our living dolls.

1450
02:02:28,103 --> 02:02:29,694
明天我们带他们去野餐
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1451
02:02:36,559 --> 02:02:38,147
如果你爱过我　多洛雷斯
If you ever loved me, Dolores...

1452
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:40,451
请你别再说了
Please stop talking.

1453
02:02:46,104 --> 02:02:48,736
我需要你爱我
I love you.

1454
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:59,075
我需要你让我自由
Set me free!

1455
02:03:04,725 --> 02:03:05,644
亲爱的
Honey...

1456
02:03:07,362 --> 02:03:10,083
我们去给他们洗澡
We'll give them baths...

1457
02:03:17,575 --> 02:03:19,584
我好爱你　多洛雷斯　我爱你　我爱你
- I love you so much, Dolores. - And I love you. I love you.

1458
02:03:50,975 --> 02:03:53,276
安德鲁
Andrew...

1459
02:03:54,866 --> 02:03:56,539
安德鲁　你听得到我吗？
Andrew, can you hear me?

1460
02:03:58,381 --> 02:04:01,562
瑞秋　瑞秋
Rachel! Rachel, Rachel...

1461
02:04:03,654 --> 02:04:04,701
瑞秋
Rachel.

1462
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:08,762
瑞秋什么
Rachel who?

1463
02:04:12,529 --> 02:04:13,574
瑞秋　雷德斯
Rachel Laeddis...

1464
02:04:15,249 --> 02:04:16,418
我的女儿
My daughter.

1465
02:04:20,353 --> 02:04:21,946
你怎么会在这
Why are you here?

1466
02:04:25,418 --> 02:04:27,092
因为我杀了我的妻子
Because I killed my wife.

1467
02:04:27,386 --> 02:04:28,726
你为什么那样作
and why did you do that?

1468
02:04:33,665 --> 02:04:36,592
她杀了我们的孩子
Dhe murdered our children.

1469
02:04:37,848 --> 02:04:40,570
她告诉我让她自由
And she told me to let her go.

1470
02:04:43,709 --> 02:04:48,019
-谁是泰德丹尼尔　 -他不存在
- Who is Teddy Daniels? - He doesn't exist.

1471
02:04:49,151 --> 02:04:51,033
-瑞秋索兰多也不存在 -是我捏造的
Neither does Rachel Solando. I made them up.

1472
02:04:51,788 --> 02:04:53,544
为什么
Why?

1473
02:04:54,381 --> 02:04:56,765
我们要听你的说法
We need to hear you say it.

1474
02:05:02,753 --> 02:05:05,764
她第一次自杀失败后
After she tried to kill herself the first time,

1475
02:05:07,355 --> 02:05:08,613
多洛雷斯告诉我
Dolores told me she...

1476
02:05:10,287 --> 02:05:11,959
她的脑子里
she had an insect...

1477
02:05:13,633 --> 02:05:15,017
活着一只虫子
living inside her brain.

1478
02:05:16,690 --> 02:05:17,486
她能感受到
She could feel it...

1479
02:05:20,331 --> 02:05:22,004
它在她脑中穿梭
clicking across her skull...

1480
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,818
拉扯她的神经　却只是为了好玩
pulling the wires, just for fun.

1481
02:05:29,412 --> 02:05:31,630
她告诉我的
She told me that.

1482
02:05:32,552 --> 02:05:34,646
她告诉我　但我没听
She told me but I didn't listen.

1483
02:05:40,125 --> 02:05:41,885
我太爱她了
I loved her so much.

1484
02:05:43,314 --> 02:05:44,700
为什么你要编造那些
Why did you make them up?

1485
02:05:47,095 --> 02:05:50,456
因为我无法相信多洛雷斯杀了我们的孩子
Because I can't take knowing that Dolores killed our children.

1486
02:05:58,730 --> 02:06:02,766
我是杀了他们的凶手　因为我都没有帮过她
I killed them, because I didn't get her help.

1487
02:06:07,316 --> 02:06:10,411
是我杀了他们
I killed them...

1488
02:06:14,193 --> 02:06:18,308
安德鲁　我的理论是.. 我们先前曾有重大突破
Here's my theory, Andrew. We broke through once before,

1489
02:06:18,392 --> 02:06:21,250
但九个月前,你又开始退化了
nine months ago, and then you regressed.

1490
02:06:23,101 --> 02:06:26,376
-我记不得了　 -我知道
- I don't remember that. - I know.

1491
02:06:27,552 --> 02:06:30,786
你重开机(Reset)了　安德鲁　就像录音带
You reset, Andrew. Like a tape playing

1492
02:06:30,910 --> 02:06:35,197
不停的一遍一遍播
over and over on an endless loop.

1493
02:06:35,409 --> 02:06:38,473
我希望我们做的一切 能够阻止这样的事情再发生了
I hope that what we've done will be enough to stop it from ever happening again

1494
02:06:38,473 --> 02:06:41,078
我需要知道
But I need to know ...

1495
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:43,725
你已经接受了现实
you have accepted reality.

1496
02:06:50,111 --> 02:06:53,260
你一直紧跟着我　医生
You came after me, huh, doctor?

1497
02:06:56,205 --> 02:06:59,143
你一直试着帮我 在大家都束手无策的时候
You tried to help me when no one else would.

1498
02:07:11,113 --> 02:07:13,636
我的名字是安德鲁雷德斯
My name is Andrew Laeddis...

1499
02:07:19,936 --> 02:07:24,266
我在1952年的春天杀了我的妻子
And I murdered my wife in the spring of '52.

1500
02:07:49,008 --> 02:07:50,942
今早上怎么样
How we doing this morning?

1501
02:07:51,447 --> 02:07:53,040
还不错,你呢
Good. And You?

1502
02:07:53,208 --> 02:07:55,308
没什好抱怨的
Can't complain.

1503
02:08:04,176 --> 02:08:05,855
下一步准备干吗?
So what's our next move?

1504
02:08:06,653 --> 02:08:08,039
你告诉我
You tell me.

1505
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:15,391
我们要离开这监狱　查克
I've gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

1506
02:08:17,912 --> 02:08:21,356
回到陆地上去　这里发生的一切都太糟了
Get back to the mainland. Whatever the hell is going on here. It's bad.

1507
02:08:42,784 --> 02:08:45,011
别担心伙伴 我会赶上
Don't worry, partner. They're not gonna catch us.

1508
02:08:52,045 --> 02:08:53,714
没错，你看来比他们聪明多了
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1509
02:08:55,828 --> 02:08:57,006
是的　我们是啊。
Yeah, we are. Aren't we?

1510
02:09:13,778 --> 02:09:16,075
你知道吗　这里让我搞不懂一件事
You know this place makes me wonder.

1511
02:09:17,076 --> 02:09:18,493
恩　你指什么　老大
Yeah? What's that boss?

1512
02:09:20,031 --> 02:09:21,122
哪种情况最糟
Which would be worse?

1513
02:09:22,755 --> 02:09:24,707
你想当一个活着的怪物
To live as a monster ...

1514
02:09:25,422 --> 02:09:27,773
还是做一个死去的好人？？
or to die as a good man.

1515
02:09:36,681 --> 02:09:38,697
泰德?
Teddy?

1516
02:10:40,998 --> 02:10:46,297
