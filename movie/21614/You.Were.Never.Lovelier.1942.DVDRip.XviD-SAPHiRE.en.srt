1
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,590
Hotel Acuna, please.

2
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,938
-What's his name?
-Eduardo Acuna. He's the big boss.

3
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,341
-Here's his office.
-Oh, thanks.

4
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,913
Oh, boy.

5
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,417
l'll get you later. Thanks.

6
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,546
l absolutely, positively
cannot interrupt Mr. Acuna.

7
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,386
He is busy.

8
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,127
Sorry, those are my orders.

9
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,231
Please don't blame me.

10
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,495
-When he's free, l'd like to see him.
-l ask myself the same question.

11
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,868
Why see Mr. Acuna when there are so
many pleasant people they could see?

12
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,569
Tell him Robert Davis
of New York is here.

13
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,372
-Robert Davis.
-Yes?

14
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,607
Mr. Robert Davis of New York
to see you, Mr. Acuna.

15
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,547
I never heard of him.
Tell him to go away.

16
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,551
Well, l must say, l'm used to
more cordiality than that.

17
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,693
He's making a big mistake.

18
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,161
Mr. Davis, you impress me.
What did you want to see him about?

19
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,863
That.

20
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,633
What?

21
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,168
That.

22
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,508
-l only asked you a civil question.
-And l answered you.

23
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,148
-You don't mind if l wait?
-No, but it won't do you any good.

24
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,116
That's very nice. The wedding dress
and the lingerie, l approve.

25
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,089
You may go, and thank you.

26
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,327
Well, darling,
what's been going on here?

27
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:56,195
Eduardo had a slight disagreement
with Delfina about Julia's trousseau...

28
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,303
...so now he's picking out
one himself.

29
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,599
lt's my invariable rule to distrust
women's taste in clothes.

30
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,366
That's why he asked me to come by.

31
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,875
First time l heard of a father
selecting a trousseau.

32
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,378
You know as well as l do that women
dress for one another, not for men.

33
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,881
Delfina's mother put her in fluff
when l married her.

34
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,815
She's been in fluff ever since.
Does your son like fluff?

35
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,480
My dear, for the first few weeks,
he won't know what Julia's wearing.

36
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,957
-Will your wife forgive you for this?
-Forgive me? l expect to be thanked.

37
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:26,462
-And thank you, Maria, for coming.
-That's all right. Goodbye, Eduardo.

38
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,079
-Who are you, the florist?
-Do l look like a florist?

39
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,409
How do l know what a florist
looks like? Who are you?

40
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,778
Xavier Cugat, remember me?

41
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,285
Didn't l bring you down here
from New York for something?

42
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,424
My orchestra has packed
your Sky Room for the past two weeks.

43
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,854
That is something!

44
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,121
l never go to the Sky Room.
My cover charge is too high.

45
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,663
Of course! You're to play
at my daughter's wedding tomorrow.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,729
Very well.

47
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:09,369
Play this softly and remotely,
as though you were not there.

48
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:14,239
Mr. Acuna, you can forget my name,
stay away from the Sky Room...

49
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,748
...underpay me, but you cannot
dictate how my orchestra should play.

50
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,753
You play this softly.

51
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,355
How l wish l was back at the Waldorf.

52
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,006
-Bob Davis!
-Cugie!

53
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,437
What are you doing here?

54
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,442
l just came down for a holiday.
l didn't know you were here.

55
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,103
A holiday? You didn't know
there was a racetrack here?

56
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,512
-Well, yes, and--
-And now you're broke again?

57
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,278
Yep, l gotta put these feet
back to work for a while.

58
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:58,390
But, gee, l like it here. You know,
the people, the city, the horses.

59
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:02,255
But this fellow, Acuna, he's tough.
He won't see me.

60
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,487
Acuna won't see him?

61
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,030
Why, in New York,
he won't see Acuna.

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,260
This, Fernando,
is the greatest man in the world.

63
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,133
Tell Acuna that Mr. Davis will give him
just two minutes of his time.

64
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,832
Oh, no. You tell him.

65
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,774
Yes, Mr. Acuna?

66
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,779
Remind me to give Cugat back
to the Waldorf. He annoys me.

67
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,279
Very funny man.
He kills me.

68
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,754
You know, actually l have a great deal
of influence with Acuna. What's that?

69
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,553
l didn't say a thing.
Just minding my own business.

70
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,926
Come along. l've a show to do. While
we play, we'll think of something.

71
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,859
Terrific! l've made up my mind.
We'll work together again!

72
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,463
-With you, we'll be better than terrific.
-l don't like Acuna's attitude.

73
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,656
-l'm going to change it right now.
-No, l have a better way.

74
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,166
l'm playing at his daughter's wedding.
You will sing, you will dance.

75
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:36,172
You will be sensational!
Acuna will come to you on his knees.

76
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,247
lt's almost time, Julia.

77
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,883
Here's your something old, sis, and
a new coin for your something new.

78
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,324
Thanks, Lita.

79
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,555
And Mama's handkerchief
for something borrowed.

80
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,563
Here's something blue, Julia

81
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,498
The bridegroom's supposed
to sleep on it, or something.

82
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,662
l suppose l should put
the coin in my shoe.

83
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,505
You'll be the next bride
in the family, Maria.

84
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,580
-Oh, no. Not me.
-Oh, but you have to be.

85
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,116
Papa made it very clear that we can't
get married until after you do.

86
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,585
He says it's our family tradition
that the girls be disposed of...

87
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,587
...one, two, three, four.

88
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,316
And you'll be the oldest now.

89
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,723
Papa will get over that silly tradition.

90
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,729
No, he won't.
Papa never gets over anything.

91
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,029
You don't expect to marry those
two tennis-playing Romeos, do you?

92
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,071
But we love Tony and Roddy
passionately.

93
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,835
They've even given us
their signet rings, see?

94
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,911
Why, you're babies.

95
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,244
You just don't know what it's like to be
so much in love that you cry all night.

96
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,780
You're right there.

97
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,150
lt's all right for you to talk.
You turn men down by the dozens.

98
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,223
You've got an ice cube for a heart.

99
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,385
-Unaccustomed as l am to getting a--
-There's something wrong with Maria.

100
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:08,261
-She says she'll never get married.
-l did not say that.

101
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:13,201
You know, Papa, l think you'd better
put a cooling system in their room.

102
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,604
Now, you leave Maria to me.
Don't worry, she's next...

103
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,473
...and then will come your turn,
and then yours.

104
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,807
-Do we have to wait for Maria?
-Yes.

105
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,780
And this is a fine way to act
on your sister's wedding day.

106
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,442
Now, run along
and fix your pretty faces.

107
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,688
Getting nervous, dear?
We're going to miss you.

108
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,694
Has Mama forgiven you yet
for picking out my trousseau?

109
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,456
l don't know. Her door was locked.

110
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,431
She broke down and confessed
that she liked my dress.

111
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:48,266
These skirmishes l have with your
mother are not typical of married life.

112
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,570
-Aren't they, Father?
-No, they're just typical of me.

113
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,804
-l'm very difficult to live with.
-No, you're not, darling.

114
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,448
You're really just a little boy,
and l love you.

115
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,743
And l love you too, darling.

116
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,284
Will you hook me, Eduardo?

117
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,855
Delfina, don't you think it's about time
you learned to dress yourself?

118
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,255
lt's so hard for me to believe l'm old
enough to have a married daughter.

119
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,759
lt doesn't put any strain on me.

120
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,932
Julia.
Where are the rest of my girls?

121
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,035
Oh, Maria! Lita! Cecy!

122
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,797
-Coming, Mother.
-Coming, Mama!

123
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,308
l want to see you all in a row.

124
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,604
Oh! l'm going to cry tonight.

125
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:34,116
You'd better start now. lt's getting late.
Do you want some last-minute advice?

126
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,516
Just don't act too intelligent
on your honeymoon.

127
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,623
l made that mistake with your father.

128
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,625
That reminds me. Tell me something
clever to say after the wedding.

129
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,889
Oh, dear, l'm so happy.

130
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,024
Hurry, girls.
Now remember, keep in step.

131
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,535
l am going to cry.
l'm going to cry right now.

132
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,944
He didn't even look around.

133
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:31,356
Have your son pass the word. l have
three more where Julia came from.

134
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,859
-You two ask Papa now.
-While he's laughing.

135
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,035
Come on.

136
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,272
-Mr. Acuna.
-Yes?

137
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,844
We've been going with your daughters
Cecy and Lita for two years now and--

138
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,345
What do you want, a pension?

139
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:00,185
-All right, who's going to be next?
-l am.

140
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,060
-Maria has to catch it.
-Yes.

141
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,232
But l don't want it.

142
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,031
-Here's a volunteer groom.
-Let's have a double wedding.

143
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,867
-l'm between engagements.
-Here l am.

144
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,406
How about me?

145
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,844
Oh, you're all much too kind.

146
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,015
Papa! Papa! Did you see Maria?
She froze those boys.

147
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,589
Papa, you've just got
to do something about her.

148
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,590
Pardon me, could you please tell me
where l could find Mr. Acuna?

149
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,760
He went inside.

150
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,711
On second thought,
l guess old el groucho can wait.

151
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,976
Don't these overdone weddings
bore you to death? They kill me.

152
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,641
l say if two people want
to get married, let them.

153
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,915
They don't have to go through
a shindig like this. lt's murder.

154
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,665
Oh, well, l'll admit my attempt
at conversation wasn't so hot.

155
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,230
Shall l try again?

156
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,870
lt's a nice day, isn't it?

157
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,340
The air's nice.

158
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,485
And there seems to be
an abundance of it.

159
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:44,023
Say, look, would you mind very much
if l tear myself away from you?

160
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,861
No.

161
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,976
But you don't understand.

162
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,808
Now, let's hear no more about Maria.
Run along, girls.

163
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,615
May l see you a moment, please?
lt's very important to both of us.

164
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,554
l'm Robert Davis.
l came here to dance and--

165
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,158
Hello.

166
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,221
Now, what is there about that girl
that made you go--?

167
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,162
She's beautiful.

168
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,666
She's beautiful, all right.

169
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,863
But she has a personality
like the inside of a refrigerator.

170
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,167
ln addition to which,
she is my daughter.

171
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,367
She is? She is?!

172
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,071
She is. Now, what was it
you wanted of me?

173
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,479
Just your permission to go out
and hang myself.

174
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,183
Fernando.

175
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,057
Fernando!

176
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,465
Fernando!

177
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,396
What?

178
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,208
Were you sleeping again?

179
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:10,178
Tell me, my dear Fernando,
why do I put up with you?

180
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,577
l don't know, Mr. Acuna...

181
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,915
...unless it's because l'm your
third cousin on your wife's side.

182
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,223
Ah, yes. Did you get Mrs. Castro?

183
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,520
Mrs. Castro is on her way here.

184
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,630
All right.

185
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,229
Now go back to sleep, Fernando.

186
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,867
I dare you to!

187
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,373
-Hi, Fernando.
-Good morning, Mr. Davis.

188
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,743
lt's good to hear the voice
of a human being again. Sit down?

189
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,443
No, thanks. l'd like to see
Mr. Acuna if he's not busy.

190
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,281
This morning he's nervous.
He probably won't see you.

191
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,286
-How'd you make out?
-Oh, fine.

192
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,086
l opened my mouth too wide
and kept it open too long.

193
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,059
l want to apologize to the old boy.

194
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,596
Mr. Robert Davis wants
to see you, Mr. Acuna.

195
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,566
I don't like Mr. Robert Davis.
I don't want to see him.

196
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,297
Advise him to go back to New York
and don't be subtle.

197
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,872
Throw him out!

198
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,476
But look, Mr. Acuna, l just....

199
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,473
This is the first time anything
like this has ever happened to me.

200
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,486
Oh, lady.

201
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,646
Better not to go in there. Nervous.

202
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,025
-Good morning, Maria.
-Eduardo.

203
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,928
l'm a worried man. Maria,
besides having the same name...

204
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,797
...you and my Maria have a lot
in common, haven't you?

205
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,166
Well, l'm her godmother,
we should have.

206
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,709
Would you say she has a personality
like the inside of a refrigerator?

207
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,710
l certainly would not.

208
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,212
But she freezes men to death.
She turns on that sophistication--

209
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,214
Sophistication, fiddlesticks!

210
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,546
Maria's as old-fashioned
as a hoop skirt.

211
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,848
Ridiculous! l know my own daughter.

212
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,957
You think you know
your own daughter.

213
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,717
l know there's something wrong.

214
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,157
She hasn't fallen in love
since she was 1 5...

215
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,787
...when she got starry-eyed about
that silly knight on a white horse.

216
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,490
-Lochinvar?
-Yes.

217
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,000
You'd think she'd have outgrown
that tin hero by now.

218
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,695
She's probably waiting
for a myth to come to life.

219
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:19,435
Oh, nonsense! Will you stop thinking
of Maria as a child? She's a woman.

220
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,479
l know women. They all fall in love
with an illusion. l'll get her over that.

221
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,709
Will you leave Maria alone
and stop worrying?

222
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,718
Someday, a man will come along
who will stir her imagination.

223
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,219
How?

224
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,119
By doing something
more romantic than the others.

225
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,954
Such as?

226
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:41,293
Well, perhaps by sending her flowers
from an ''unknown admirer''...

227
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,197
...intriguing her
with just the right kind of note.

228
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,265
Fernando! Get the two most
beautiful orchids you can find.

229
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,672
Bring them here for a note
to be attached.

230
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,711
Eduardo, don't you meddle with this.

231
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,906
lf l don't do something,
she'll get hurt.

232
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,019
l won't stand by and let her waste the
best years of her life chasing knights.

233
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,554
Have you gone crazy?
You can't manufacture romance.

234
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,420
l'll create an unknown admirer
and see what happens.

235
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,926
l'll use my left hand
to disguise my writing. Clever?

236
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,930
You think you have the answer
for everything.

237
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,762
What if she falls in love
with your imaginary lover?

238
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,666
Don't worry. lf the orchids
and notes intrigue her...

239
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,673
...l'll furnish the young man myself.
She'll never know the difference.

240
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,902
Dearly beloved....

241
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,807
Eduardo, l'm warning you.

242
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,841
-Papa! Hello, Aunt Maria.
-Hello.

243
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,082
What are you doing here?

244
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,721
Must l have an invitation
to my own home for tea?

245
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,949
-ls that you, Eduardo?
-Yes, yes.

246
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,787
What on earth are you doing here?

247
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,021
You'd think my only privilege
in this house was paying the bills.

248
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,994
Aunt Maria, it's good to see you.

249
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,964
-Wasn't that the doorbell?
-Expecting somebody, Papa?

250
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,196
No, why should l be expecting
somebody? Sit down, Maria.

251
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,896
Thank you.

252
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,903
l'm really upset with your son, Maria...

253
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,446
...and with your daughter Julia,
Eduardo!

254
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,948
l went to the hotel
where they're honeymooning.

255
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,554
-What for? ln the name of all--
-Don't speak when l'm interrupting.

256
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,849
To see if there was anything
l could do for them.

257
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,286
As if there would be.

258
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:51,553
l thought they'd want to discuss what
they intend to do on their honeymoon.

259
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,096
But they sent down word
they weren't in.

260
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,961
Perhaps they weren't, Delfina.

261
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,570
At the same time, they also sent down
for a bottle of champagne.

262
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,899
-l felt like--
-Wasn't that the doorbell?

263
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,839
Something's wrong with Papa.
He's always hearing bells.

264
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,324
Well, well, well! Orchids.

265
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,860
Shame on Tony.
He should save his money.

266
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,466
-How do you know they're not for me?
-Bring me the flowers, Cecy.

267
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,594
Why, there's a card inside.

268
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,897
Nobody ever sends me flowers.

269
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,437
After a woman gets married...

270
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,871
...her husband decides
she can't smell anymore.

271
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,069
Now, don't get that martyred look.
They're for Maria.

272
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,443
-For Maria?
-Why, they-- They are for Maria.

273
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,084
Well, somebody's
just trying to be funny.

274
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,020
''Dearly beloved,
l send you orchids--''

275
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,554
-Let Maria read her own card.
-Go ahead, Mama.

276
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,954
lt probably ends up with a joke.

277
00:24:55,126 --> 00:25:00,689
''--because my heart is no longer mine,
now that l have seen you.

278
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,164
Be kind to these orchids.

279
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:08,602
lt is not their fault that they can
never be as lovely as you.''

280
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,372
Why, it brought tears to my eyes.

281
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,977
That note was written by a man
with a sensitive soul.

282
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,613
lt sounded pretty silly to me.

283
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,875
A charming man sends you the most
beautiful note ever written...

284
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,643
...and you say it sounds silly?

285
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,052
''Your unknown suitor.'' And l don't
think much of his handwriting.

286
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,120
Well, perhaps he's left-handed.

287
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,796
How does this card strike you,
Aunt Maria?

288
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,990
lf it had been sent to me
and l didn't know who'd written it...

289
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:40,297
-...l should think it was pretty silly.
-Aunt Maria's right.

290
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,263
Whoever he is,
he'll have to do better than that.

291
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,671
Let me see the card, Maria, please.

292
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,041
-What are you two whispering about?
-Well, l--

293
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,207
l was saying that if that note
didn't warm Maria's heart...

294
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,513
...the next one, l believe,
may well start a flame within her.

295
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,748
Why, Eduardo, you remind me
of our courting days.

296
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,758
He was always telling me
how l lit a flame in him.

297
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,987
Sometimes l wonder
if it hasn't gone out.

298
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,393
l'll have you know that
l'm twice the man l was.

299
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,831
l would settle for half the man
you were, dear.

300
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,580
Here are the love lyrics you wanted.

301
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,480
The love songs and
the great love letters of Napoleon.

302
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,746
Just put them down and get out.

303
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,162
Sorry!

304
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,841
Right on time, 5:00.

305
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:41,390
You know, Louise, l'm beginning
to wonder what he's like.

306
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,244
She's in love at last.

307
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,409
l'm going to wear Tony's ring
where everybody can see it.

308
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,453
Now we can be secretly engaged
and tell everybody.

309
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,328
-No orchids for almost a week.
-Sunk again.

310
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,131
l guess we'd better
put our rings back.

311
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,005
Hello.

312
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,147
Oh, hello, Papa.
When did you get back in town?

313
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,181
Just now. How's everything at home?

314
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,183
Oh, we're all right,
but Maria's in the dumps.

315
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,151
Maria, in the dumps? Why?

316
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,382
She hasn't received orchids all week.

317
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,221
No orchids all week?
How stupid of me!

318
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,694
l mean, tell her, of course, that
no one's been making a fool of her.

319
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,765
No, don't tell her anything.

320
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,999
Well, how does she know
the orchid sender didn't get sick?

321
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,573
Well, say hello to your mother.
See you soon. Goodbye.

322
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,954
Dearly beloved...

323
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,752
...although l have been
desperately ill...

324
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,287
...in my delirium, they....

325
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:10,901
ln my delirium,
they told me l asked only for you.

326
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,431
Have you got my number?
3 790.

327
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,500
This time, he's shaving.

328
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,340
No, don't bring
a lottery ticket in here.

329
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,744
l can escape to the lobby
for a moment.

330
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,648
-l'll see you there. Right now.
-Did you give him my message?

331
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,552
Yes, and he said to have you arrested
for trespassing if you came in again.

332
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,888
Mr. Davis, give up.
He'll never see you.

333
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,519
Fernando. Send a bellboy
in here immediately.

334
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,544
Mr. Acuna?

335
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,650
There's money
and a note on my desk.

336
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,809
Take them,
buy two magnificent orchids...

337
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,753
...attach the note, then take the
flowers to my home. ls that clear?

338
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,660
Yes, sir. But first, could l see--?

339
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,924
Hurry it up! This is an emergency.
And bring back the change.

340
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,999
Yes, sir.

341
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,369
l'll be back.

342
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,248
''Dearly beloved, dearly beloved...

343
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,112
...dearly beloved, dearly beloved.''

344
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,482
-l wouldn't take it so hard.
-l'm not taking anything hard.

345
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:42,183
Beware of note writers who haven't
the courage to court you face to face.

346
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,328
Even my clock's slow.

347
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,901
No, it isn't. Look, dear. Look.

348
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,990
''For Miss Maria Acuna.''
Thank you, sir.

349
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,692
Thank you with all my heart and soul.

350
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,499
You're an angel.

351
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,813
Hoist the anchor, Cecy,
we're in again.

352
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:50,553
You know, l think
l've seen him before.

353
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,960
Louise, would you be a darling and
pick up the pieces of notes l tore up?

354
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,002
Yes, yes.

355
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,639
''Dearly beloved....''

356
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,941
Jumping blue blazes!

357
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,450
Can't you even order a teapot
for that hotel without calling me?

358
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,113
Why do l put up with it?
All right, all right.

359
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,122
Maybe l can fly up next week.

360
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,727
ln the meanwhile, start looking
for another profession.

361
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,832
One that won't require the use of that
addled fraction of a brain of yours.

362
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,127
Mr. Acuna, here's your change.

363
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,271
Two pesos, 50 centavos.

364
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,738
-What are you doing here?
-l delivered the orchids for you...

365
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,140
-...now you're going--
-You delivered the orchids?

366
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:45,476
l'm not gonna try to figure out how
you substituted yourself for a bellboy.

367
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,585
Mr. Acuna, l've been trying for days
to dance for you.

368
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,814
You're the only man who's ever
refused to see my work, and l resent it.

369
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,981
Get out of my office!

370
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,793
Now, look, this is a matter of pride
with me. l don't like to dance, see?

371
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,454
l came down here to get away from it.

372
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,190
Shall l have you thrown out?

373
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,666
You can't talk that way to me.
Honest, l'm an important guy.

374
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,738
Now, you're gonna see me dance
and like it.

375
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,203
Oh, no, l'm not.

376
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,810
Oh, yes, you are. Take it, boys.
One, two.

377
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:30,212
-Well?
-Excellent. Beautiful.

378
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,009
But l don't want it.
Mr. Davis...

379
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,211
...you do something to me that results
in the most fascinating dislike ever.

380
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,585
-May l make an observation?
-You may make your exit!

381
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,888
Mr. Acuna, your overwhelming
graciousness bewilders me.

382
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,690
However, l bear no grudges.

383
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,964
When you change your mind, call me.

384
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,001
Out of my sight!

385
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,231
Thank you again for your welcome.

386
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,344
You let that jumping jack in my office.

387
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,918
You'll pay for this with every drop
of your anemic blood.

388
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,715
You nincompoop! You worm!

389
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,951
You're fired! Now get out and never
come back, you diddling dimwit.

390
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,959
''Diddling dimwit''?

391
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,263
Welcome home, Papa.

392
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,198
l could have sworn
l heard you swearing.

393
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,894
Why, l thought you were--

394
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,597
Aren't you looking extraordinarily
happy about something?

395
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,300
-l am happy.
-Couldn't be orchids, could it?

396
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,411
And l'll let you in on a secret.

397
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,548
l know who's been
sending me the flowers.

398
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:42,778
You do? Now, look, darling,
everything can be explained.

399
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,252
-What do you mean?
-Tell me what you're talking about.

400
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,392
The orchids, the notes.

401
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,789
-l know who sent them.
-You do?

402
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,691
-Well, you don't seem brokenhearted.
-Well, why should l be?

403
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:58,733
-l'm glad you're taking it this way--
-Tell me what you're talking about.

404
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,963
-Tell me who you're talking about.
-Oh, Mr. Acuna?

405
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,733
When you change your mind,
l'll be up in Room 920.

406
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,337
Oh, Papa, that's who
l'm talking about. He's the one.

407
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,607
-He's what?
-The one who's in love with me.

408
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,580
-He is not!
-Oh, yes, yes.

409
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,482
l saw him bring
the orchids this afternoon.

410
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,215
Oh, l remember.
He sang at the wedding.

411
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,258
l tell you, he's not the one
who's been sending you the flowers!

412
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:27,329
lf he is, he's a pest!
He's not only a pest, he's a dancer!

413
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,763
-How wonderful. l love--
-He's not for you! He's out of work!

414
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,838
Then you give him work,
for me.

415
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:40,033
Don't tell me you could do anything so
ghastly as to get mixed up with him.

416
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,805
And to think l was cool to him
at the wedding.

417
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,505
l forbid you
to fall in love with this man!

418
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,584
And besides, it's too late.
He's going somewhere.

419
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,243
New York, l hope.

420
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,822
Well, maybe l can change his mind.

421
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,117
You should read what he wrote to me.

422
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,821
No. No, on second thought,
l don't think your heart could stand it.

423
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:05,697
-Anybody can write a love letter.
-l'd like to see you try it.

424
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,169
Anyway, he's not leaving
South America...

425
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,639
...if l can help it.
And l think l can.

426
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,541
-What was his room number?
-My mind's a blank. l've forgotten.

427
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,477
l haven't.

428
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,276
920, please.

429
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,817
You ask him to the house tonight.

430
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,420
What's gotten into you, Maria?
Nice girls don't act this way.

431
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,083
-Nice girls don't feel the way l do.
-Why, you're brazen.

432
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,524
How could l be...

433
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,164
-...with a heart like an ice cube?
-l didn't say that.

434
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:39,666
That gleam in your eye has nothing
to do with ice cubes. lt's predatory.

435
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,169
Maybe you're right.

436
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,971
-920, please.
-All right.

437
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,542
When l've signed those papers,
l'll ask him.

438
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,838
You're a very sweet papa.

439
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,973
Oh, and l'll have to hurry.
l've only got three hours to dress.

440
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,410
Bye, sweets.

441
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:57,721
-Why did you have to tell him off?
-Don't worry, he'll come around.

442
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,622
-Why did you have to tell him off?
-Don't worry, he'll come around.

443
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,952
Oh, you don't know him.

444
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,927
You know, Acuna is the most
opinionated man in South America.

445
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,156
l'll show you.

446
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,172
See that nose?

447
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,510
That nose shows opinionation.

448
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,128
His ears indicate mulishness.

449
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,105
His forehead slopes like a tin roof.

450
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:58,280
-No intellect whatsoever.
-What about his chin?

451
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,418
Oh, his chin clearly indicates
weakness of character.

452
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:06,853
Handlebar mustache,
no sense of humor.

453
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:11,222
His droopy eyelids
indicate he's a dope.

454
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,989
Very flattering, Cugat.

455
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,262
-Oh, Mr. Acuna.
-The Sky Room is going to miss you.

456
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,633
ln the meanwhile,
l will speak to Mr. Davis alone.

457
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,106
Sure, sure.
Will you excuse me, please?

458
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,342
Mr. Davis, l find myself
in an embarrassing position.

459
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,044
Think nothing of it, sir.
We all make mistakes.

460
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,055
-When do l start dancing?
-You do not start dancing.

461
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,386
-Didn't you come to see about--?
-One of my daughters.

462
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:48,658
The one you so gallantly referred to
as the ''inside of a refrigerator.''

463
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,993
But l'm afraid l don't follow you.

464
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,830
She thinks you're in love with her.

465
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:58,033
Would it be rude of me to inquire
if there's any insanity in your family?

466
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,177
And what's worse, she has the
illusion that she's in love with you.

467
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,940
-Oh, my. Poor child.
-lt's not her fault. lt's yours.

468
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:09,709
-l still don't follow you.
-You took her the orchids, didn't you?

469
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,754
Why, l left some orchids
at your door, yes.

470
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,154
But what's that got to do with the
idea l'm in love with your daughter?

471
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,562
She's been receiving orchids and
love notes from an unknown admirer.

472
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,799
-Then she thinks l'm the fellow?
-So you've stirred her imagination.

473
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,767
l don't want to stir her imagination.
l didn't write any notes.

474
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,406
Don't you think l know that?
l wrote those notes myself.

475
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:34,135
-You? Then there is insanity.
-No, there isn't.

476
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,212
All you've got to do is to
let her think you wrote those notes.

477
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,839
-l see. Then what?
-Then disillusion her.

478
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,350
-Tell her l didn't send the flowers?
-Of course not.

479
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,047
Her pride would be crushed. She's got
to believe that you admire her...

480
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:51,217
...and yet for her own happiness, she's
got to lose her infatuation for you.

481
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,754
That's easy. Just tell her l'm a heel.

482
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,456
l want her to discover that
for herself.

483
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,001
Yeah? How?

484
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,366
By being your own obnoxious self
when you come to my house tonight.

485
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,370
Oh, l'm coming to your house tonight?

486
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,099
To complete the disillusionment...

487
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,040
...you'll tell her you're sailing
for North America tomorrow.

488
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,478
But l'm not. l like it here.

489
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,307
l'll pay your transportation
and a bonus as well.

490
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,215
Thanks just the same, Mr. Acuna.

491
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,289
My only interest at the moment
is in your Sky Room.

492
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:24,450
lf you do this for me, l'll give you a
contract to dance, at some future date.

493
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,960
Will you put that in writing
and leave the date open?

494
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,292
-Yes.
-Okay.

495
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,957
-What time shall l show up?
-At 9:00.

496
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,004
And don't stay too late.

497
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,044
-Something in my eye.
-A keyhole, no doubt.

498
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,614
-Until tonight at 9.
-And l won't stay too late.

499
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,083
Look what we found.

500
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,692
ls this your Robert Davis?

501
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,726
That's the one.
He brought the orchids.

502
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,865
He's ''The ldol of New York.''

503
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,397
l like his smile...

504
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,058
-...and the twinkle in his eye.
-Remember Mama's advice:

505
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,204
Don't frighten him
with your intelligence.

506
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,001
-Just act simple and mysterious.
-l know, make an entrance.

507
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,542
Be casual, as though
l didn't know he was coming.

508
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,476
That's right. Come on, Cecy.

509
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,182
Eduardo.

510
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,054
-Do l look all right?
-You're as beautiful as ever, my dear.

511
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,695
lt just takes longer now.

512
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,694
Ouch!

513
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:38,130
Oh, l forgot. l had a pin in my mouth.
Did it go in very deep?

514
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,100
l'll probably look like
a Ubangi by midnight.

515
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,505
Hurry, it's 9:00.

516
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,508
lf you giggle again, l'm going to
throw cold water in your face.

517
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,374
You think Mr. Davis wants to marry
into a family of gigglers?

518
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,539
Maria won't marry this young man.
She's not going to like him.

519
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,912
He has absolutely no good qualities.

520
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,953
That's not for you to decide.

521
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:03,116
l read in a book that a salmon swims
miles and miles to find a mate...

522
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,090
...and Maria has swum long enough.

523
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,095
Maria is going to wait
until the right man comes along.

524
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,132
Why should she? l didn't.

525
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:19,300
Oh, it's Mr. Davis. He can't meet us
scattered around the hall.

526
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,274
-Hurry, Mama.
-Come on.

527
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:30,243
-Good evening, Mr. Acuna.
-Mr. Davis.

528
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,911
-Did you receive the contract?
-Yes, sir.

529
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,887
Then l can depend on you?

530
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,720
Don't worry, she'll be disillusioned.

531
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,834
Maria, may l present
Mr. Robert Davis.

532
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,237
-We've met before, haven't we?
-Yes. No.

533
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,571
That is-- ln a way, but--

534
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,737
We will translate
that remarkable statement...

535
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:01,351
...after you've met
the rest of the family.

536
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:09,223
This is Mrs. Acuna.
My daughters Cecy and Lita.

537
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,521
Mr. Robert Davis.
He can't stay long.

538
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,824
Sit down, Mr. Davis.

539
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:27,036
l accidentally read
one of your beautiful notes to Maria.

540
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:31,479
lt's a shame that such a talented
young man is unemployed, Eduardo.

541
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,513
Oh, but didn't Mr. Acuna tell you?

542
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,209
l'm to dance in his Sky Room
starting tomorrow night.

543
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,753
-lsn't that so, Mr. Acuna?
-The date was left open.

544
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:43,120
-But you meant tomorrow, didn't you?
-Oh, of course he did.

545
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,956
And you're going to love
working for Papa. lsn't he?

546
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,624
Oh, l'm sure l will.
Oh, l almost forgot.

547
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,564
These are for you.
There's no note this time, because--

548
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:58,765
l'd rather you'd say
what you might have written anyway.

549
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,322
-Do you mind if l smoke?
-Oh, of course not.

550
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,588
No, thank you.

551
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,301
Have l said something wrong?

552
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,166
He thinks it's real.

553
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,274
l had it made
into a cigarette lighter, Mr. Davis.

554
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,309
Oh, l see.
For a moment, it looked real.

555
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,573
Oh, l guess it's killed
many a man in its day...

556
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,717
...but it's only an antique now.

557
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,352
But you wouldn't mind
pointing it that way a little bit?

558
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,456
-Of course not, but it's harmless.
-Oh, l'm sure it is.

559
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,663
Do you mind?
l could stand a little air.

560
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,889
There's lots of it in the garden.

561
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,193
Remember?

562
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,359
-What if l'd killed him?
-Never mind him.

563
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,198
What about the vase?

564
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:06,070
Oh, now he'll never get back
into a romantic mood.

565
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,974
Maybe some music would
quiet his nerves. Come on.

566
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,081
After my notes, l must be
an awful disappointment to you.

567
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:22,748
Oh, on the contrary.

568
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,985
l like modest men.

569
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,727
Well, l don't know exactly
how to tell you, but--

570
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,060
l like bashfulness too.

571
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:40,770
Your city is so cosmopolitan, and this
shack of yours is so magnificent...

572
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,141
...frankly, l feel like
a duck out of water.

573
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,544
l think you'd fit in anyplace.

574
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:50,175
But l mean, l wouldn't fit into
this kind of life, your kind of life.

575
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,618
l don't like it much either.

576
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,280
But you don't know my kind of life.

577
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,053
-lt's music and dancing, isn't it?
-Yes.

578
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:01,391
Well, we love your North American
music and dances down here.

579
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:05,262
Oh, but imagine a man like me
having to dance for a living.

580
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,699
l can't imagine a happier way
to earn one.

581
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,764
There's a great weakness
in my character.

582
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,775
-l'm a sucker for a horserace.
-They thrill me too.

583
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,312
l'd probably bet my last cent on
a horse. As a matter of fact, l did.

584
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,042
l have a gambler's heart myself.

585
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,480
You know...

586
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,281
...l think that's why
your notes intrigued me so.

587
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,458
Look, little lady,
as they'd say in Brooklyn:

588
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:35,030
''l can't bat in your league.'' l'm a plain,
ordinary guy from Omaha, Nebraska.

589
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:38,258
Just an old-fashioned,
everyday Middle Westerner.

590
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:41,802
Why, my grandfather
was a cattle raiser.

591
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,735
So was mine!

592
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,933
But you're streamlined. You're today.

593
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:52,377
Sister, l was raised amongst the
grasshoppers. l am strictly from corn.

594
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,083
I am not such a clever one

595
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:04,023
About the latest fads

596
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:08,290
I admit, I was never one

597
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:13,402
Adored by local lads

598
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:19,133
Not that I ever try to be a saint

599
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,838
I'm the type

600
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:28,041
-That they classify as quaint
-Quaint

601
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,480
That they mother you

602
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,348
Quaint that they brother you

603
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,455
Must be another you

604
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,955
I like the other you

605
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:40,085
I'm old-fashioned

606
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,994
I love the moonlight

607
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,101
I love

608
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:52,071
The old-fashioned things

609
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,871
The sound of rain

610
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,777
Upon a window pane

611
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,817
The starry song

612
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:08,481
That April sings

613
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:12,058
This year's fancies

614
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:16,393
Are passing fancies

615
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:21,162
But sighing sighs
Holding hands

616
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:27,641
These my heart understands

617
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,714
I'm old-fashioned

618
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:35,010
But I don't mind it

619
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:40,248
That's how I want to be

620
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:46,419
As long as you agree

621
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:52,999
To stay old-fashioned

622
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,231
With me

623
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,923
lt's getting late, Mr. Davis.

624
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:43,136
-lt's your play, Eduardo.
-Well, l don't want that card.

625
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,373
Rummy.

626
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:01,590
Am l the first girl you never kissed?

627
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,857
l knew a fellow once who came
to a lull like this with a girl and--

628
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,998
Yes?

629
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,633
He didn't know what to say.

630
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,896
l heard of a man once
who was in love with a girl...

631
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,973
...and afraid to say so.

632
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,510
Cugat. l promised to meet him.

633
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,848
l almost forgot. You'll forgive me
if l go, won't you?

634
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:35,320
-Of course.
-l'm awfully sorry. l promised to see--

635
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:38,724
Good night.

636
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,461
-Why, he's leaving.
-Good.

637
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,194
Mr. Davis.

638
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,837
-Doesn't Maria dance beautifully?
-Yes.

639
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,768
You should've seen her
dressing for you.

640
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,272
No dress was good enough,
even though she has dozens.

641
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:57,004
-Not that she's extravagant, Mr. Davis.
-l'm sure she's not. Good night, girls.

642
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,740
When Mama was away once,
Maria ran the house herself.

643
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,783
-Papa said the bills were cut in half.
-And what meals we had!

644
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:06,012
-Maria majored in domestic science.
-She did?

645
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:09,317
Everyone remarks on what
a perfect wife she'll make.

646
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,427
l agree. Absolute--
lf l could just have my hat.

647
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,257
-Oh, of course.
-You must forgive the girls...

648
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,765
...they're just anxious for Maria
to get married so they can be married.

649
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,995
-Well, thank you very much--
-They don't need to worry any longer.

650
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:26,541
-l'd say Maria's falling in love.
-We'd miss her if she left.

651
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,234
We'd be willing to make the sacrifice
for her happiness.

652
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,710
Thanks. lt's been so nice.

653
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,611
-Leaving so soon, Mr. Davis?
-Yes.

654
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,582
But l hate to.

655
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,279
-Good night.
-Good night.

656
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,324
-Thanks a lot.
-Oh, you're very welcome.

657
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,893
Will you three stop interfering
with Maria's life?

658
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,859
Will you leave that to me?

659
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,693
-Oh, Maria!
-Oh, Maria!

660
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,096
-lsn't he just wonderful?
-How'd you make out?

661
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,433
The first time in my life l ever
really wanted a man to kiss me...

662
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,770
...and he had something else to do.

663
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,273
But the next time,
it's going to be different.

664
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,982
Eduardo, did you hear that?

665
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,187
-Hi, Fernie.
-Oh, no. Over my dead body.

666
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:18,760
-l'm not going to get fired again today.
-Must you clutter up the doorway?

667
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,059
-You betrayed me last night.
-Me? How?

668
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,860
By deliberately concealing
your true and obnoxious nature...

669
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,628
-...and making yourself be charming.
-l did not.

670
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,398
Maybe there is insanity
in the female branch of the family.

671
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,700
They've conceived
a misguided affection for you.

672
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:36,972
-They think l'm in love with Maria.
-The mention of love between you...

673
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,080
...makes my flesh creep.

674
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:43,581
How you can be the father of such
a lovely girl absolutely amazes me.

675
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,984
-l resent that remark.
-l resent how you butt into her life.

676
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,454
But you have absolutely
no right to resent anything.

677
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,595
Mr. Acuna, l've arranged to fly back
to New York by the next plane.

678
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,526
-You've what?
-You can tear up that contract.

679
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,496
-l've decided to beat it.
-Oh, you have? Just like that?

680
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,933
Yes, sir, l'm going to dump
your entire asinine predicament...

681
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,232
...right back into your lap.

682
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,740
Oh, l see. You want them to think
that l forced you to leave.

683
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,776
lsn't that exactly what you're doing?

684
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:13,643
You want Maria to think you're a
martyr, sacrificed on the altar of love.

685
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,086
That idiotic statement didn't come
from your wife's side of the family.

686
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,779
Mr. Davis, you signed
a binding contract with me.

687
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,050
You'll stay here,
or l'll file an injunction.

688
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,160
-Yesterday, you wanted--
-That was before...

689
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,422
...your hideous display of charm
last night. Now l have a new plan.

690
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,930
You will live up to your contract
in the Sky Room...

691
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,900
-...but you will keep away from Maria.
-ls that supposed to be brilliant?

692
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,097
That will let her know that you
merely used her to get the contract.

693
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,799
Naturally, then, she will loathe you.

694
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:43,445
That's just dandy. Then what?

695
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,077
Then, to show you how little
you've meant to her...

696
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:50,379
...she will immediately fall in love
with a more acceptable young man.

697
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:54,080
One of many whom l will invite
to my home in the immediate future.

698
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,886
-You think she'll fall in love quickly?
-Mr. Davis...

699
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:02,293
...l have an instinct about emotional
responses of the feminine heart.

700
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,328
Don't you think
l ought to explain to Maria that--?

701
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:07,867
No.

702
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,367
-Why, l thought perhaps--
-No.

703
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,237
Our mutual aim
is that she loathe you, isn't it?

704
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,878
l guess so.

705
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,975
-l was just thinking--
-No.

706
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,779
You do the dancing,
l'll do the thinking.

707
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,628
Fernando, in making out the guest list
for the wedding anniversary ball...

708
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,396
...I wanna include the most
outstanding and charming men...

709
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,369
...who have ever been guests
in my home.

710
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,030
Yes, sir.

711
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,905
Wait a minute!
l thought l discharged you yesterday!

712
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:54,045
Mrs. Acuna told me to forgive
your display of temper, so l have.

713
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,412
l forgive you, Mr. Acuna.

714
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:58,417
Oh, thank you very much.

715
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:01,489
Not at all, sir.
l'll prepare the list.

716
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,988
''Mr. and Mrs. Acuna request
the pleasure of your company...

717
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,653
...at the 25th anniversary
of their wedding.

718
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,026
Fancy dress.''

719
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,691
l can't believe
it's been 25 years, Delfina.

720
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,600
That's because
you aren't married to Eduardo.

721
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:19,867
l might have been
if you hadn't seen him first.

722
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,204
-Where's Maria?
-Tennis lesson.

723
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:23,868
But her mind isn't on the ball.

724
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:28,575
She's still trying to figure out why
Mr. Davis didn't kiss her, l guess.

725
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,015
-Oh, hello, Fernando.
-Good afternoon, Lita...

726
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:35,146
...Mrs. Acuna, Castro, Cecy.

727
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:39,055
Mr. Acuna sent me with his approved
list of young men he wishes invited.

728
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:42,391
-Oh, swell!
-Let me see.

729
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:48,999
l don't see Mr. Davis' name here,
Fernando. Mr. Robert Davis.

730
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:53,108
lt seems that Mr. Robert Davis
is not on Mr. Acuna's approved list.

731
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,274
He's the only one on my list.

732
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:56,707
-Hello, Aunt Maria.
-Hello.

733
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,143
-Fernando.
-Hello.

734
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,806
Do you know why Papa
left Mr. Davis off the list?

735
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,953
He said something about Mr. Davis
devoting himself to the Sky Room...

736
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:08,284
-...from now, henceforth.
-Thank you, Fernando.

737
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,585
You know, we're expecting you
at the celebration.

738
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,161
Thank you, Mrs. Acuna.
You honor me. Sweet.

739
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,389
-Bye.
-Goodbye, Fernando.

740
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:20,935
l'd be interested in meeting
your Robert Davis, Maria.

741
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,402
Well, l haven't a thing to do
right now.

742
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,667
How nice. Neither have l.

743
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,742
A little faster, Cugie, please.
Once more.

744
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,613
One, two.

745
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,288
Hold it.

746
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,301
Well, hello.

747
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,370
-Does your father know you're here?
-No, why should he?

748
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,167
-Mrs. Castro, may l present--
-Why, l remember you.

749
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:04,109
-So you're Maria's Robert.
-Yes-- Well, l don't know. Am l?

750
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,111
Won't you come in and sit down?

751
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,807
We are special emissaries
from Mr. and Mrs. Acuna.

752
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:12,512
We're asking the pleasure of your
company on Wednesday evening.

753
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,054
-Thank you.
-At 9 p.m., but...

754
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,682
...you can come earlier if you like.

755
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:21,193
Are you sure Mr. Acuna
wants me to come?

756
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,094
Oh, he'd be devastated if you didn't.

757
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,632
And so would l.

758
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:29,363
You were coming back
in half an hour, weren't you, Auntie?

759
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:36,334
Oh, yes, in a half an hour. Goodbye.

760
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:42,379
Won't you sit down?

761
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:49,449
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

762
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,355
We were just running over
a little thing from Harlem.

763
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,758
But l don't suppose
you've heard of Harlem here.

764
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,866
lsn't that where the zoot suit
with the reet pleat comes from?

765
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,869
Yeah.

766
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,836
-l'd like to hear it. May l?
-Certainly.

767
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,497
Oh, Cugie, let's have it.

768
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,742
Just heard of the Shorty George

769
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,350
Got word of the Shorty George

770
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,680
Seems that it's a kind of jig

771
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,655
Named for someone about so big

772
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,023
He rambles around the town

773
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,629
Preambles around the town

774
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,925
Then steps on a crowded street

775
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,897
And beats his feet till his feet is beat

776
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,367
Watch him go

777
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,836
And he can

778
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,066
Like a real

779
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:43,440
Natural man

780
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,672
High stepper is Shorty George

781
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,544
Black pepper is Shorty George

782
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,549
He dances to pay the rent

783
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,315
And to see that you're solid sent

784
01:04:55,191 --> 01:05:00,322
Say, mister, can you spare a penny?

785
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:05,263
Lady, can you spare a dime?

786
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:10,371
He makes
I don't know how many

787
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:14,942
Because he's dancing all the time

788
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:19,908
Papa's dressed up mighty sporty

789
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:24,678
Mama's snoozing in the shade

790
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:29,084
But while Mama's catching 40

791
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,092
Shorty sees the rent is paid

792
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,891
Get hip to the Shorty George

793
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,591
Hop, skip to the Shorty George

794
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,361
Directions are short and sweet

795
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,131
I know you'll beat your feet
Until your feet is beat

796
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:23,958
Are you sure he's coming?

797
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,299
Does Papa know?

798
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,867
Do you think he'll propose tonight?

799
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,734
Well, if he doesn't,
it won't be my fault.

800
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:34,365
Maria!

801
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,148
My, isn't Papa handsome?

802
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,654
Just think, Papa, you've been
married longer than we've lived.

803
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:52,453
Well, l consider that a very fortunate
coincidence, my dear.

804
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:55,252
Maria.

805
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,627
lt just occurred to me
that l neglected to ask Mr. Davis...

806
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,032
...to come to the house tonight.
That doesn't bother you, does it?

807
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,764
-Should it, Papa?
-lt's just, l thought it unforgivable...

808
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,875
...that he didn't call on you
after starting his contract with me.

809
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,307
He hasn't sent
any more orchids, has he?

810
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,344
-No more notes?
-Nope.

811
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,483
-You don't seem upset about it.
-l'm not.

812
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,912
Well, that's fine.

813
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,178
There'll be some handsome
young men tonight.

814
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,981
l want you to have a happy time.

815
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,522
l expect this to be
the happiest night of my life.

816
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:26,422
That's a good girl. l knew you'd let Mr.
Davis know exactly where he stands.

817
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,325
Yes, Papa,
that's just what l intend to do.

818
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,693
Papa, Grandma's here. Hurry!

819
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,807
Thank you very much.
Very kind of you.

820
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,707
-Congratulations.
-Oh, Maria.

821
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,721
What's going on between
your wife and my husband?

822
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,123
They're always whispering.

823
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,560
This is a fine time
to suspect your husband...

824
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,130
...on your wedding anniversary.

825
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,864
Well, l don't know.

826
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,202
You're such a fool,
and you think you're so smart.

827
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,899
Why, Maria actually
seemed happy...

828
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:18,012
...when l told her
l hadn't invited Mr. Davis.

829
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:26,484
Robert.

830
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,782
-Oh, Mr. Davis.
-We're so glad to see you.

831
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,687
Thank you.
Congratulations, Mrs. Acuna.

832
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:34,226
-lt's so nice of you to ask me.
-We're happy to have you, aren't we?

833
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,058
-Delighted. Aren't we, Papa?
-Yes, indeed.

834
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,632
Congratulations, Mr. Acuna.

835
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:41,292
lt gives us all an opportunity
to say goodbye to him.

836
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,698
-Goodbye?
-Goodbye?

837
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:45,601
He received an offer from New York,
didn't you, Robert?

838
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,766
-Well, that is--
-lnsisted on taking tomorrow's plane.

839
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:50,707
Didn't you, Robert?

840
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,107
Yes, l guess l did.

841
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,841
-Oh, Mr. Davis, you can't!
-We won't let you!

842
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,145
l'm sure Mr. Davis
knows what's best.

843
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,585
-For him.
-You must induce him to stay.

844
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,590
l have no alternative. He asked me
to tear up the contract.

845
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,093
-Didn't you, Robert?
-Yes, sir.

846
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,831
Grandma wanted to meet you.

847
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,673
-lsn't she a lovely girl?
-l've never met a lovelier one.

848
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,783
Remember, l have
my own chapel at home...

849
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,647
...if you'd like to get married
without the usual Acuna fuss.

850
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,310
Granny, we....

851
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,481
You don't understand.
We have no use for a chapel.

852
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,720
We've just heard that Mr. Davis
is forced to leave us.

853
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:44,464
You chose exactly
the right word, Maria.

854
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:51,402
Our dear friends, 52 years ago
in a little village in Brittany...

855
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,734
...my beloved mother
and father were married.

856
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,309
When they came to South America
they brought a song...

857
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,036
...and a happy tradition with them.

858
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,443
This music was played
at their wedding...

859
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,982
...and 25 years ago,
at Delfina's and mine.

860
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,484
And now, in honor
of my beloved mother...

861
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,451
...and in tribute
to my charming wife...

862
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:10,285
...l have asked Mr. Cugat
to play that music for us tonight.

863
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,405
Listen to the birdies
Letting those squeaks out

864
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:31,444
Puffing their cheeks out
All around the place

865
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,605
Little hurdy-gurdies
Sounding so merry

866
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:37,684
Getting so very blue in the face

867
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:43,189
Surely there's a reason
Everybody's gay

868
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:48,922
It must be the season
For a wedding day

869
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,896
Ding-dong dell
The bells in the steeple go

870
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:54,592
Ding-dong dell
Around the countryside

871
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,671
Ding-dong dell
And off all the people go

872
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,206
Off to kiss the bride

873
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,004
All the donkey carts are driving

874
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,772
To the wedding in the spring

875
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,712
All the neighborhood's arriving

876
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,352
To see the wedding ring

877
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,284
Now they're forming in a column

878
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,084
For the service has begun

879
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:22,128
Although the padre's solemn
He's the only one

880
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,131
Down the aisle
The page and the flower girls

881
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,667
In a while
The happy bride and groom

882
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,965
The ladies smile
We'll give her a shower, girls

883
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,234
Dishes and a broom

884
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:39,905
All the gentlemen are jolly
For the wine is flowing free

885
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:45,349
All the ladies melancholy
For the days that used to be

886
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,115
When the carriage
That's been waiting

887
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,088
Takes the newlyweds away

888
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:57,165
The crowd keeps celebrating
Till the break of day

889
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,800
Ding-dong dell
The bells in the steeple go

890
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:02,732
Ding-dong dell
Around the countryside

891
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,601
Ding-dong dell
Toast the bride

892
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,174
Then farewell
Off they ride

893
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:09,674
Oh, what fun

894
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:14,043
Comes under the heading
Of wedding in the spring

895
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:05,392
Hey, you've got to make Davis
so jealous that he won't leave Maria.

896
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,161
lf he takes a plane,
it's gotta be on a honeymoon with her.

897
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,964
Will you do it?

898
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,698
Well, well,
what are you waiting for?

899
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:29,146
Listen, old man, l started this dance
with Maria, and l'm going to finish it.

900
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,802
Go out there and cut in on him.

901
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:46,099
Keep after him until he's so jealous
he can't stand it.

902
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,180
Help!

903
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:12,195
Mr. Davis, how dare you
attack a guest of mine!

904
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,165
-The jester was getting out of hand.
-And getting in my hair.

905
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:19,535
-l will not tolerate this sort of thing.
-lt was our fault, we egged him on.

906
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,608
But falling in the pool
was his own fault!

907
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:25,472
Everything that happens
in the Acuna family is my fault.

908
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:29,276
l work long hours, l do as l'm told,
and where does it get me?

909
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,679
ln the end?

910
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:34,845
Oh, so it's you!
You chose your costume well, fool!

911
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,991
Mr. Acuna, l have stood enough.

912
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,627
Fernando, l didn't know.
l guess it was partly my fault.

913
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:43,231
lt's not your fault l'm distantly related
to this fuddy-duddy by marriage.

914
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:45,798
-What was that again?
-You will bark at me no longer!

915
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,766
l resign, and don't take advantage
of our family connections...

916
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:52,338
...to try to get me back again.
Fuddy-duddy.

917
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:57,500
Oh, let's tell the truth.
We were trying to help ourselves.

918
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,704
We're sick and tired
of being old maids.

919
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,746
We wanted
to make Robert jealous...

920
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,215
...so that he'd propose to Maria
before he left.

921
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:07,253
-You're wasting your time.
-Well, why?

922
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:11,188
Because l'm not in love with Robert
and he's not in love with me.

923
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:14,487
l think we've embarrassed
him enough.

924
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,227
Don't let it upset you, Robert.

925
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:24,770
Maria was bound to come
to her senses sooner or later.

926
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,202
Kind of settles your problems,
doesn't it?

927
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,040
Would you mind
if l said goodbye to her?

928
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,271
Not at all, not at all.

929
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:33,971
Thanks.

930
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,039
Maria.

931
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,449
Why did you say that
to Robert out there?

932
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,951
What else could l say?

933
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:43,216
Everybody's trying go push him into
marrying me. Even Granny tried it.

934
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,690
lf you ask me,
l don't think he needs any pushing.

935
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,351
Maria.

936
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:49,924
There's something l've got to say.

937
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:54,091
Take her in the garden.
You can say it much better out there.

938
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,703
The air's nice out there, remember?

939
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,374
l just wanted to say that--

940
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,219
Gee, you're beautiful.

941
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,192
lt's funny, l had so much to say.

942
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,090
And now l can't think
of a darned thing.

943
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:26,996
Where was l?

944
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,297
You said l was beautiful.

945
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:33,567
Oh, yes, l did.

946
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:40,339
Look, would you mind turning
the other way, please?

947
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,048
Why?

948
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,519
l can't concentrate
when you look at me like that.

949
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:55,019
l was only kidding.

950
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,561
Oh, you're terrific!

951
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,632
What's the use?

952
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:14,506
I was never able to recite a fable
That would make the party bright

953
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:17,015
Sitting at the table
I was never able

954
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,745
To become the host's delight

955
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:26,385
But now you've given me
My after-dinner story

956
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:32,932
I'll just describe you as you are
In all your glory

957
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:38,371
You were never lovelier

958
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,101
You were never so fair

959
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:46,441
Dreams were never lovelier

960
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,675
Pardon me if I stare

961
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,712
Down the sky
The moonbeams fly

962
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,326
To light your face

963
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,688
I can only say

964
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:05,856
They chose the proper place

965
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:10,569
You were never lovelier

966
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,903
And to coin a new phrase

967
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:18,477
I was never luckier

968
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:22,310
In my palmiest days

969
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:27,148
Make a note
And you can quote me

970
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,689
Honor bright

971
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:34,487
You were never lovelier

972
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:38,497
Than you are tonight

973
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,063
ls that what you wanted
to say, Robert?

974
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,432
Well, that's only the first part.

975
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,972
l don't quite know how
to tell you the rest.

976
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,942
Well, maybe l can make
it easy for you.

977
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:53,205
l love you too.

978
01:20:56,751 --> 01:21:00,084
Oh, doctor, you've struck a nerve!

979
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:10,320
Well, Robert,
did you say goodbye?

980
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:13,524
Not exactly.
lt was more like hello.

981
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,170
l can never say goodbye
to her, sir.

982
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:18,033
-l love Maria.
-You don't say.

983
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,867
Well, that's just too bad.

984
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,702
lt would be
if she didn't love me too.

985
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,004
That's poppycock.
You heard what she said.

986
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:27,012
Yep, l was there. You weren't.

987
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:31,312
-You're leaving on tomorrow's plane.
-Yeah, but with Maria.

988
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,977
You'll do nothing of the kind!

989
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:37,050
Sit down, Robert, sit down.

990
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:42,486
This is going to hurt you,
and l admit, l'm sorry for you.

991
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:46,031
Maria isn't in love with you.
She merely thinks she is.

992
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,463
That's good enough for me.

993
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:50,196
-How will she feel when she finds out?
-Finds out what?

994
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,033
That you weren't
her unknown admirer?

995
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:55,643
That you agreed to deceive her
in exchange for a contract?

996
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,569
Well, that's not a very pretty way
to put it.

997
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,272
A woman doesn't mind you lying
when you compliment her...

998
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:04,384
...but she'd never forgive a lie
that made her a moonstruck ninny.

999
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:08,079
She's not. And l haven't been
exactly lying to her.

1000
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,951
Besides, you got me into this.

1001
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:13,822
Did you know that Maria
found a romantic ideal at 1 5?

1002
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,587
-No.
-She did.

1003
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,232
His name was Lochinvar.

1004
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,926
You don't mean that fellow
on a white horse?

1005
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:22,364
A sort of knight?

1006
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:24,664
She cherished a dream
that she'd meet a man...

1007
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,399
-...that measured up to that ideal.
-l don't believe that.

1008
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:28,940
She's a big girl now.

1009
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,135
Have you taken a good look
at her lately?

1010
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,679
At heart, she's still the same
romantic girl.

1011
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:37,746
You were just an accident, my boy.
lt might have been anybody.

1012
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,285
Any man who arrived
when she was ready and waiting...

1013
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,720
...for the lover who intrigued her,
who brought her orchids.

1014
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:47,157
There'd come a day when
the illusion l created would vanish.

1015
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:50,628
Suddenly, she'd see you
as you really are.

1016
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,129
And that's...? That's bad, huh?

1017
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,065
For Maria, yes.

1018
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,400
Yeah.

1019
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:02,406
l'm sorry.

1020
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:06,172
l try to appear hard,
but l'm a fake, Robert.

1021
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,145
At heart, l'm a sentimentalist.

1022
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,181
l pity you, but l love my daughter.

1023
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:12,843
l want to see her happy.
Don't you?

1024
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,046
Of course l do.

1025
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:18,825
lf l go north, will you promise
that she'll never know...

1026
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,794
-...that l didn't send the notes?
-l give you my word.

1027
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:25,524
lt's just that l want her
to remember me...

1028
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,065
...as she thinks l am.

1029
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:28,600
l'll let her keep her memories.

1030
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:31,238
As a matter of fact,
l'll compose a farewell note...

1031
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:34,273
...that she'll treasure
as long as she lives.

1032
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,601
lt's best that l don't see her again.

1033
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,679
l wouldn't know what to say.

1034
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:43,045
l'll say it.
l'll break it gently.

1035
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:45,118
Thank you, sir.

1036
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:55,795
We're awfully sorry, Fernando.

1037
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,625
We didn't mean to get you in trouble.

1038
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:01,496
l'm going to insist that Eduardo
ignore his resignation.

1039
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,265
Oh, Mama.

1040
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:06,032
While you're there, will you
put in a good word for Robert?

1041
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,437
Of course, dear.

1042
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:12,779
''Dearly beloved...

1043
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:16,542
...as long as my heart beats, l'll never
forget the softness of your lips...

1044
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,743
...the pounding of your heart
against mine.

1045
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,911
Yes, my dearest, darling Maria...

1046
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:25,082
...l will always cherish the exquisite
torture of our stolen kisses...

1047
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:27,552
...our sweet stolen moments together.

1048
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:31,756
-Maria, my secret love.''
-Maria?

1049
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:35,100
You and Maria Castro!

1050
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,465
Now l know what all that
whispering's been about.

1051
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:41,735
-You bluebeard!
-Delfina, give me that note.

1052
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:45,971
The ''softness'' of her....
The ''pounding'' of her....

1053
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:49,605
To think that you,
lovemaking with Maria.

1054
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,809
The godmother of your own child.

1055
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:53,987
The wife of your best friend.

1056
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:57,181
Writing a love note to her
on our own wedding anniversary.

1057
01:24:57,358 --> 01:24:59,519
-You wretch!
-Delfina, l can ex--

1058
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:01,992
Don't try to change the subject.
Say something!

1059
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:03,994
Delfina, give me that note!

1060
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:07,430
l regret having to say goodbye,
Mrs. Castro. You've been most kind.

1061
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,593
You'd better go into the library,
Mrs. Castro.

1062
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:12,069
-Your name is being bandied about.
-What's that?

1063
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,800
The pistols are on the table.

1064
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,970
Retribution day is here. Acuna's
going to get what's coming to him.

1065
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,274
-How? Why?
-He was caught red-handed...

1066
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:24,384
...writing a love note to Maria Castro.

1067
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,210
Maria Castro?

1068
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:30,881
-l'm innocent, l tell you.
-Don't touch me, you scorpion.

1069
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:34,457
Oh, Juan, we'll have to bear
this disgrace together.

1070
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,790
And we have grown children.

1071
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,695
This letter was written to your wife
by my husband.

1072
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,200
Let the reptile's own words
convict him.

1073
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,838
We caught him writing it.
He jumped like he was shot.

1074
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,564
-Did he admit it?
-l admit nothing.

1075
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,868
You keep out of this!
l'm talking to your wife.

1076
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:51,637
l gave him the best 25 years of my life.

1077
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,440
Do you deny you wrote this note?

1078
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:55,913
l ask that my daughters
leave this ridiculous scene.

1079
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,813
And l demand that they stay.

1080
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:02,150
They'll learn a lesson in matrimony
they'll never forget.

1081
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:05,359
Eduardo, l am a jealous man.

1082
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:08,690
Will you please take that injured look
from your fat face?

1083
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,460
-Did you write this note?
-Yes, l wrote the note--

1084
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:15,228
l'm sure that Papa can explain
everything if you'll just give him time.

1085
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:19,999
-Yes, if you'll just give me time.
-Well, we're listening.

1086
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:22,402
Well, this isn't the time.

1087
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,909
And what have you to say,
you brazen thing?

1088
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:28,537
My dear, sweet, darling wife,
will you please shut up?

1089
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:31,581
l'm not speaking to her again anyway.

1090
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,881
lf you wanted my husband, why didn't
you come to me and ask for him?

1091
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,455
l don't want your husband.

1092
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:38,854
There she goes,
laughing at me behind my back.

1093
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,927
Beg pardon, Delfina, right in your face.

1094
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:43,427
Oh, whispering women!

1095
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:47,694
Going to his office every day,
and him, writing letters!

1096
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,803
-He's a fiend.
-You don't know...

1097
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:51,905
-...what you're talking about.
-Don't argue!

1098
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:54,633
lf Delfina says he's a fiend,
he's a fiend.

1099
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:57,710
-They're insane, Maria, both of them.
-l am insane, Eduardo.

1100
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:01,178
lt's an insane world when
my best friend and my own wife--

1101
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:04,045
Eduardo, we must confess.

1102
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,585
Did you hear her?
She wants to confess.

1103
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:09,882
We'll confess nothing.
Not here and not now.

1104
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:14,324
-You'll have to be patient.
-l'll have to be patient?!

1105
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:17,389
Hold that gun.
lt might go off, you know.

1106
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:19,556
Now, look, l can explain everything.

1107
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,703
Mr. Acuna was not writing that letter
to Maria Castro.

1108
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,634
He was writing it to Maria,
his own daughter...

1109
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:29,504
-...as a farewell note from me.
-From you?

1110
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,817
He wrote all the notes you received,
and he sent all the orchids.

1111
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:38,714
l don't understand.

1112
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,912
He just decided that Maria
should have an unknown suitor, so--

1113
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,923
ls that true, Eduardo?

1114
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,823
You were very considerate, Papa.

1115
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,754
But how did you come into all this?

1116
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:56,401
When l delivered the orchids, Maria,
you jumped at conclusions.

1117
01:27:56,571 --> 01:28:00,667
So your father had to ask me
to act as your admirer.

1118
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:07,774
Well, how did you bring yourself
to make such a sacrifice?

1119
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,849
The truth is, l wanted this contract--

1120
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:13,454
And that's how Papa paid you
for being attentive to me.

1121
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,454
-ln a way, but later--
-Later you got tired of the assignment.

1122
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:18,285
You got in too deep.

1123
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:22,327
So Papa wrote a goodbye note
for you to send.

1124
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:27,332
l apologize for all the embarrassment
this has caused you, Aunt Maria.

1125
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:29,595
lt was partly my fault.

1126
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:33,070
l knew your father
was writing the notes.

1127
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:39,043
Well! Everybody knows now.

1128
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,841
l guess nobody had
any way of knowing...

1129
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:45,577
...l'd make such
a complete fool of myself.

1130
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,051
Congratulations, Robert.

1131
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:52,591
l hope Papa paid you well.
You earned it.

1132
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,421
lf l had written the notes...

1133
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:58,053
...l would have meant every word
your father said.

1134
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,998
Please, Maria.

1135
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:04,002
He's working overtime, Papa.

1136
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,740
You should give him a bonus.

1137
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:23,618
Will you ever forgive me, Maria?

1138
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:27,454
She may, but all my life, l'll be
haunted by your frightful suspicions...

1139
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:30,495
-...that l could have been unfaithful.
-Oh, Eduardo!

1140
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:34,897
Go and see that our guests are happy
and leave me with my conscience.

1141
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,504
-Eduardo--
-Don't say anything.

1142
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:39,799
l know, you're a jealous man.

1143
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:43,967
-Remember, l warned you.
-l remember.

1144
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:52,845
My boy, a woman's advice
isn't worth listening to...

1145
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,615
...but any man who doesn't take it
is a fool. And that's me.

1146
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,760
l've been pretty much of a dope
myself.

1147
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:03,387
For some time,
it was a positive pleasure...

1148
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,327
...for me to dislike you.

1149
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,866
lt gave me a nice, warm glow.

1150
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:11,198
But now l must confess that l've
conceived quite a fondness for you.

1151
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:13,567
What you just did smacked of nobility.

1152
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:15,936
l didn't want to see you
shot full of holes.

1153
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,635
Making that confession before Maria,
to save me...

1154
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:22,408
-...it must have been painful.
-lt wasn't any fun.

1155
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,108
Do you think she'll be all right now?

1156
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,753
Thanks to my meddling, no.

1157
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:29,253
l wonder if she'll ever forgive us.

1158
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:33,827
Mr. Acuna, would you mind very much
if l didn't take tomorrow's plane?

1159
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:35,724
You have my permission
to court Maria...

1160
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:37,694
...as long as your strength holds out.

1161
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:39,890
But l'm afraid it won't
do you any good.

1162
01:30:58,219 --> 01:31:01,211
lf these orchids aren't out of here
by the time l get back, l'll--

1163
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:02,856
l'll set fire to them.

1164
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,788
Oh, Miss Maria, can't you see
how desperate he is?

1165
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,520
All right. He made love to you
under false pretenses...

1166
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:11,324
...but he's serious now.

1167
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:15,428
You've forgiven me.
You can forgive him.

1168
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,094
l can't forgive him for what he did
to make me love him.

1169
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:21,173
What about the things you did
to make him fall in love with you?

1170
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:24,470
When you've got a fish hooked,
haul him in.

1171
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:34,553
Don't you let another orchid
in this house!

1172
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:39,090
-Miss Maria Acuna.
-Right this way, boys.

1173
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,596
These orchids if you please

1174
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,364
With apologies

1175
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,134
And another note

1176
01:31:56,911 --> 01:32:01,041
With these
Corsage we bring

1177
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,683
We're obliged to sing

1178
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,944
What the sender wrote

1179
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,747
Quote

1180
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,988
Oh, si, si, si, si
Mama

1181
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:13,752
See how I love you

1182
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:16,897
Oh, si, si, si, si
Comma

1183
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:23,025
Say you love me too

1184
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:35,575
Now, don't give up, my boy.

1185
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,741
You're bucking the man
she thought you were.

1186
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:40,012
-That fellow on the white horse?
-Yes.

1187
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:42,985
-l have an instinct for--
-For what goes on in a woman's heart.

1188
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:44,556
-l know.
-l know this.

1189
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:48,286
Every woman wants to be swept
off her feet and carried away.

1190
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:52,124
Tell me, just what did this bird
Lochinvar do about his gal?

1191
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,461
Well, he put on his best
suit of Sunday armor...

1192
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:57,536
...and rode up to her father's castle,
or whatever they lived in.

1193
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,538
There was a dance going on,
or something...

1194
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:04,109
...but Lochinvar rode into the patio,
or whatever they have in Scotland...

1195
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:07,679
...and swept the girl off her feet,
onto his horse and rode off with her.

1196
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,577
l think.

1197
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:13,311
Well, l've tried everything else.

1198
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:28,889
Robert! Robert!

1199
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,949
Wait, Robert!

1200
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:36,564
Before we go any further,
l've got to get something straight.

1201
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:39,226
Before we go any further,
l've got to get something straight.

1202
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,924
This Lochinvar fellow.

1203
01:35:41,102 --> 01:35:43,832
Lochinvar?
Never heard of him.

1204
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:46,837
Darling!
That's all l wanted to know.
