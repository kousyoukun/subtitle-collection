{3103}{3155}Hotel Acuna, please.
{3410}{3475}- What's his name?|- Eduardo Acuna. He's the big boss.
{3479}{3533}- Here's his office.|- Oh, thanks.
{3537}{3570}Oh, boy.
{3634}{3702}I'll get you later. Thanks.
{3706}{3801}I absolutely, positively|cannot interrupt Mr. Acuna.
{3806}{3845}He is busy.
{3878}{3935}Sorry, those are my orders.
{3939}{3986}Please don't blame me.
{4001}{4088}- When he's free, I'd like to see him.|- I ask myself the same question.
{4092}{4193}Why see Mr. Acuna when there are so|many pleasant people they could see?
{4206}{4257}Tell him Robert Davis|of New York is here.
{4262}{4325}- Robert Davis.|- {y:i}Yes?
{4329}{4402}Mr. Robert Davis of New York|to see you, Mr. Acuna.
{4406}{4473}{y:i}I never heard of him.|{y:i}Tell him to go away.
{4518}{4617}Well, I must say, I'm used to|more cordiality than that.
{4621}{4668}He's making a big mistake.
{4672}{4775}Mr. Davis, you impress me.|What did you want to see him about?
{4834}{4864}That.
{4875}{4906}What?
{4961}{4991}That.
{5002}{5071}- I only asked you a civil question.|- And I answered you.
{5238}{5326}- You don't mind if I wait?|- No, but it won't do you any good.
{5336}{5421}That's very nice. The wedding dress|and the lingerie, I approve.
{5426}{5469}You may go, and thank you.
{5516}{5570}Well, darling,|what's been going on here?
{5574}{5663}Eduardo had a slight disagreement|with Delfina about Julia's trousseau...
{5667}{5714}...so now he's picking out|one himself.
{5718}{5793}It's my invariable rule to distrust|women's taste in clothes.
{5797}{5835}That's why he asked me to come by.
{5839}{5895}First time I heard of a father|selecting a trousseau.
{5899}{5979}You know as well as I do that women|dress for one another, not for men.
{5983}{6039}Delfina's mother put her in fluff|when I married her.
{6043}{6109}She's been in fluff ever since.|Does your son like fluff?
{6114}{6197}My dear, for the first few weeks,|he won't know what Julia's wearing.
{6202}{6281}- Will your wife forgive you for this?|- Forgive me? I expect to be thanked.
{6285}{6389}- And thank you, Maria, for coming.|- That's all right. Goodbye, Eduardo.
{6633}{6715}- Who are you, the florist?|- Do I look like a florist?
{6719}{6795}How do I know what a florist|looks like? Who are you?
{6799}{6852}Xavier Cugat, remember me?
{6856}{6936}Didn't I bring you down here|from New York for something?
{6940}{7011}My orchestra has packed|your Sky Room for the past two weeks.
{7015}{7045}That is something!
{7050}{7124}I never go to the Sky Room.|My cover charge is too high.
{7129}{7209}Of course! You're to play|at my daughter's wedding tomorrow.
{7217}{7258}Very well.
{7282}{7417}Play this softly and remotely,|as though you were not there.
{7435}{7534}Mr. Acuna, you can forget my name,|stay away from the Sky Room...
{7538}{7642}...underpay me, but you cannot|dictate how my orchestra should play.
{7682}{7762}You play this softly.
{7821}{7897}How I wish I was back at the Waldorf.
{8130}{8200}- Bob Davis!|- Cugie!
{8204}{8234}What are you doing here?
{8238}{8306}I just came down for a holiday.|I didn't know you were here.
{8310}{8370}A holiday? You didn't know|there was a racetrack here?
{8374}{8428}- Well, yes, and...|- And now you're broke again?
{8432}{8494}Yep, I gotta put these feet|back to work for a while.
{8498}{8593}But, gee, I like it here. You know,|the people, the city, the horses.
{8597}{8685}But this fellow, Acuna, he's tough.|He won't see me.
{8690}{8739}Acuna won't see him?
{8743}{8800}Why, in New York,|he won't see Acuna.
{8804}{8877}This, Fernando,|is the greatest man in the world.
{8882}{8970}Tell Acuna that Mr. Davis will give him|just two minutes of his time.
{8974}{9035}Oh, no. You tell him.
{9050}{9081}Yes, Mr. Acuna?
{9086}{9177}{y:i}Remind me to give Cugat back|{y:i}to the Waldorf. He annoys me.
{9234}{9309}Very funny man.|He kills me.
{9314}{9417}You know, actually I have a great deal|of influence with Acuna. What's that?
{9421}{9484}I didn't say a thing.|Just minding my own business.
{9488}{9589}Come along. I've a show to do. While|we play, we'll think of something.
{13377}{13447}Terrific! I've made up my mind.|We'll work together again!
{13451}{13534}- With you, we'll be better than terrific.|- I don't like Acuna's attitude.
{13538}{13610}- I'm going to change it right now.|- No, I have a better way.
{13614}{13694}I'm playing at his daughter's wedding.|You will sing, you will dance.
{13698}{13814}You will be sensational!|Acuna will come to you on his knees.
{14163}{14200}It's almost time, Julia.
{14204}{14287}Here's your something old, sis, and|a new coin for your something new.
{14291}{14321}Thanks, Lita.
{14326}{14375}And Mama's handkerchief|for something borrowed.
{14379}{14423}Here's something blue, Julia
{14427}{14493}The bridegroom's supposed|to sleep on it, or something.
{14498}{14569}I suppose I should put|the coin in my shoe.
{14620}{14685}You'll be the next bride|in the family, Maria.
{14690}{14783}- Oh, no. Not me.|- Oh, but you have to be.
{14787}{14868}Papa made it very clear that we can't|get married until after you do.
{14872}{14951}He says it's our family tradition|that the girls be disposed of...
{14955}{14999}...one, two, three, four.
{15003}{15041}And you'll be the oldest now.
{15045}{15098}Papa will get over that silly tradition.
{15102}{15194}No, he won't.|Papa never gets over anything.
{15210}{15297}You don't expect to marry those|two tennis-playing Romeos, do you?
{15302}{15370}But we love Tony and Roddy|passionately.
{15374}{15461}They've even given us|their signet rings, see?
{15465}{15510}Why, you're babies.
{15514}{15638}You just don't know what it's like to be|so much in love that you cry all night.
{15645}{15675}You're right there.
{15679}{15756}It's all right for you to talk.|You turn men down by the dozens.
{15760}{15806}You've got an ice cube for a heart.
{15810}{15905}- Unaccustomed as I am to getting a...|- There's something wrong with Maria.
{15910}{16022}- She says she'll never get married.|- I did not say that.
{16026}{16141}You know, Papa, I think you'd better|put a cooling system in their room.
{16180}{16246}Now, you leave Maria to me.|Don't worry, she's next...
{16250}{16315}...and then will come your turn,|and then yours.
{16319}{16371}- Do we have to wait for Maria?|- Yes.
{16375}{16442}And this is a fine way to act|on your sister's wedding day.
{16446}{16506}Now, run along|and fix your pretty faces.
{16614}{16680}Getting nervous, dear?|We're going to miss you.
{16684}{16752}Has Mama forgiven you yet|for picking out my trousseau?
{16756}{16794}I don't know. Her door was locked.
{16798}{16865}She broke down and confessed|that she liked my dress.
{16870}{16981}These skirmishes I have with your|mother are not typical of married life.
{16996}{17061}- Aren't they, Father?|- No, they're just typical of me.
{17065}{17138}- I'm very difficult to live with.|- No, you're not, darling.
{17142}{17202}You're really just a little boy,|and I love you.
{17206}{17257}And I love you too, darling.
{17261}{17293}Will you hook me, Eduardo?
{17298}{17379}Delfina, don't you think it's about time|you learned to dress yourself?
{17383}{17461}It's so hard for me to believe I'm old|enough to have a married daughter.
{17465}{17521}It doesn't put any strain on me.
{17526}{17597}Julia.|Where are the rest of my girls?
{17601}{17671}Oh, Maria! Lita! Cecy!
{17675}{17737}- Coming, Mother.|- Coming, Mama!
{17801}{17869}I want to see you all in a row.
{17912}{17972}Oh! I'm going to cry tonight.
{17977}{18081}You'd better start now. It's getting late.|Do you want some last-minute advice?
{18085}{18138}Just don't act too intelligent|on your honeymoon.
{18142}{18189}I made that mistake with your father.
{18193}{18285}That reminds me. Tell me something|clever to say after the wedding.
{18289}{18363}Oh, dear, I'm so happy.
{18402}{18462}Hurry, girls.|Now remember, keep in step.
{18466}{18546}I am going to cry.|I'm going to cry right now.
{21842}{21889}He didn't even look around.
{22218}{22330}Have your son pass the word. I have|three more where Julia came from.
{22352}{22438}- You two ask Papa now.|- While he's laughing.
{22456}{22490}Come on.
{22596}{22640}- Mr. Acuna.|- Yes?
{22644}{22725}We've been going with your daughters|Cecy and Lita for two years now and...
{22730}{22785}What do you want, a pension?
{22922}{23021}- All right, who's going to be next?|- I am.
{23057}{23114}- Maria has to catch it.|- Yes.
{23255}{23286}But I don't want it.
{23290}{23353}- Here's a volunteer groom.|- Let's have a double wedding.
{23358}{23397}- I'm between engagements.|- Here I am.
{23402}{23434}How about me?
{23447}{23517}Oh, you're all much too kind.
{23612}{23713}Papa! Papa! Did you see Maria?|She froze those boys.
{23717}{23798}Papa, you've just got|to do something about her.
{23979}{24062}Pardon me, could you please tell me|where I could find Mr. Acuna?
{24066}{24114}He went inside.
{24199}{24305}On second thought,|I guess old {y:i}el groucho can wait.
{24331}{24407}Don't these overdone weddings|bore you to death? They kill me.
{24411}{24471}I say if two people want|to get married, let them.
{24475}{24573}They don't have to go through|a shindig like this. It's murder.
{24751}{24855}Oh, well, I'll admit my attempt|at conversation wasn't so hot.
{24915}{24964}Shall I try again?
{25074}{25124}It's a nice day, isn't it?
{25158}{25207}The air's nice.
{25250}{25330}And there seems to be|an abundance of it.
{25386}{25511}Say, look, would you mind very much|if I tear myself away from you?
{25523}{25555}No.
{25860}{25893}But you don't understand.
{25898}{25985}Now, let's hear no more about Maria.|Run along, girls.
{26036}{26125}May I see you a moment, please?|It's very important to both of us.
{26129}{26219}I'm Robert Davis.|I came here to dance and...
{26223}{26257}Hello.
{26307}{26379}Now, what is there about that girl|that made you go...?
{26383}{26425}She's beautiful.
{26454}{26485}She's beautiful, all right.
{26490}{26562}But she has a personality|like the inside of a refrigerator.
{26566}{26617}In addition to which,|she is my daughter.
{26622}{26670}She is? She is?!
{26674}{26759}She is. Now, what was it|you wanted of me?
{26776}{26865}Just your permission to go out|and hang myself.
{27038}{27073}{y:i}Fernando.
{27202}{27238}{y:i}Fernando!
{27290}{27320}{y:i}Fernando!
{27354}{27390}What?
{27400}{27457}{y:i}Were you sleeping again?
{27462}{27577}{y:i}Tell me, my dear Fernando,|{y:i}why do I put up with you?
{27594}{27634}I don't know, Mr. Acuna...
{27638}{27738}...unless it's because I'm your|third cousin on your wife's side.
{27762}{27841}Ah, yes. Did you get Mrs. Castro?
{27847}{27920}Mrs. Castro is on her way here.
{27925}{27971}{y:i}All right.
{28006}{28081}{y:i}Now go back to sleep, Fernando.
{28140}{28193}{y:i}I dare you to!
{28247}{28301}- Hi, Fernando.|- Good morning, Mr. Davis.
{28305}{28381}It's good to hear the voice|of a human being again. Sit down?
{28386}{28470}No, thanks. I'd like to see|Mr. Acuna if he's not busy.
{28474}{28538}This morning he's nervous.|He probably won't see you.
{28542}{28586}- How'd you make out?|- Oh, fine.
{28590}{28677}I opened my mouth too wide|and kept it open too long.
{28682}{28749}I want to apologize to the old boy.
{28766}{28833}Mr. Robert Davis wants|to see you, Mr. Acuna.
{28838}{28905}{y:i}I don't like Mr. Robert Davis.|{y:i}I don't want to see him.
{28909}{28970}{y:i}Advise him to go back to New York|{y:i}and don't be subtle.
{28974}{29008}{y:i}Throw him out!
{29012}{29070}But look, Mr. Acuna, I just...
{29142}{29214}This is the first time anything|like this has ever happened to me.
{29276}{29310}Oh, lady.
{29314}{29386}Better not to go in there. Nervous.
{29485}{29539}- Good morning, Maria.|- Eduardo.
{29543}{29633}I'm a worried man. Maria,|besides having the same name...
{29637}{29701}...you and my Maria have a lot|in common, haven't you?
{29706}{29758}Well, I'm her godmother,|we should have.
{29762}{29867}Would you say she has a personality|like the inside of a refrigerator?
{29882}{29915}I certainly would not.
{29919}{29999}But she freezes men to death.|She turns on that sophistication...
{30003}{30047}Sophistication, fiddlesticks!
{30051}{30103}Maria's as old-fashioned|as a hoop skirt.
{30107}{30158}Ridiculous! I know my own daughter.
{30162}{30209}You think you know|your own daughter.
{30213}{30251}I know there's something wrong.
{30255}{30309}She hasn't fallen in love|since she was 15...
{30314}{30396}...when she got starry-eyed about|that silly knight on a white horse.
{30401}{30437}- Lochinvar?|- Yes.
{30442}{30497}You'd think she'd have outgrown|that tin hero by now.
{30502}{30562}She's probably waiting|for a myth to come to life.
{30566}{30676}Oh, nonsense! Will you stop thinking|of Maria as a child? She's a woman.
{30680}{30773}I know women. They all fall in love|with an illusion. I'll get her over that.
{30777}{30850}Will you leave Maria alone|and stop worrying?
{30854}{30922}Someday, a man will come along|who will stir her imagination.
{30926}{30958}How?
{30963}{31028}By doing something|more romantic than the others.
{31032}{31072}Such as?
{31076}{31200}Well, perhaps by sending her flowers|from an "unknown admirer"...
{31204}{31293}...intriguing her|with just the right kind of note.
{31341}{31415}Fernando! Get the two most|beautiful orchids you can find.
{31419}{31473}Bring them here for a note|to be attached.
{31477}{31545}Eduardo, don't you meddle with this.
{31550}{31598}If I don't do something,|she'll get hurt.
{31602}{31697}I won't stand by and let her waste the|best years of her life chasing knights.
{31701}{31781}Have you gone crazy?|You can't manufacture romance.
{31786}{31850}I'll create an unknown admirer|and see what happens.
{31854}{31934}I'll use my left hand|to disguise my writing. Clever?
{31938}{32006}You think you have the answer|for everything.
{32010}{32074}What if she falls in love|with your imaginary lover?
{32078}{32144}Don't worry. If the orchids|and notes intrigue her...
{32148}{32240}...l'll furnish the young man myself.|She'll never know the difference.
{32244}{32293}Dearly beloved...
{32313}{32387}Eduardo, I'm warning you.
{33141}{33227}- Papa! Hello, Aunt Maria.|- Hello.
{33250}{33281}What are you doing here?
{33285}{33344}Must I have an invitation|to my own home for tea?
{33348}{33421}- Is that you, Eduardo?|- Yes, yes.
{33426}{33465}What on earth are you doing here?
{33470}{33543}You'd think my only privilege|in this house was paying the bills.
{33547}{33590}Aunt Maria, it's good to see you.
{33594}{33661}- Wasn't that the doorbell?|- Expecting somebody, Papa?
{33666}{33739}No, why should I be expecting|somebody? Sit down, Maria.
{33743}{33780}Thank you.
{33850}{33924}I'm really upset with your son, Maria...
{33928}{33985}...and with your daughter Julia,|Eduardo!
{33989}{34045}I went to the hotel|where they're honeymooning.
{34049}{34131}- What for? In the name of all...|- Don't speak when I'm interrupting.
{34135}{34186}To see if there was anything|I could do for them.
{34190}{34221}As if there would be.
{34225}{34323}I thought they'd want to discuss what|they intend to do on their honeymoon.
{34327}{34384}But they sent down word|they weren't in.
{34388}{34429}Perhaps they weren't, Delfina.
{34433}{34515}At the same time, they also sent down|for a bottle of champagne.
{34519}{34571}- I felt like...|- Wasn't that the doorbell?
{34575}{34665}Something's wrong with Papa.|He's always hearing bells.
{35004}{35061}Well, well, well! Orchids.
{35065}{35121}Shame on Tony.|He should save his money.
{35125}{35208}- How do you know they're not for me?|- Bring me the flowers, Cecy.
{35233}{35283}Why, there's a card inside.
{35287}{35338}Nobody ever sends me flowers.
{35342}{35375}After a woman gets married...
{35379}{35433}...her husband decides|she can't smell anymore.
{35437}{35510}Now, don't get that martyred look.|They're for Maria.
{35514}{35591}- For Maria?|- Why, they... They are for Maria.
{35595}{35654}Well, somebody's|just trying to be funny.
{35665}{35725}"Dearly beloved,|I send you orchids..."
{35729}{35785}- Let Maria read her own card.|- Go ahead, Mama.
{35789}{35843}It probably ends up with a joke.
{35847}{35980}"...because my heart is no longer mine,|now that I have seen you.
{35985}{36040}Be kind to these orchids.
{36044}{36170}It is not their fault that they can|never be as lovely as you."
{36181}{36237}Why, it brought tears to my eyes.
{36241}{36299}That note was written by a man|with a sensitive soul.
{36303}{36362}It sounded pretty silly to me.
{36366}{36440}A charming man sends you the most|beautiful note ever written...
{36445}{36483}...and you say it sounds silly?
{36487}{36589}"Your unknown suitor." And I don't|think much of his handwriting.
{36598}{36662}Well, perhaps he's left-handed.
{36692}{36750}How does this card strike you,|Aunt Maria?
{36754}{36827}If it had been sent to me|and I didn't know who'd written it...
{36831}{36930}...I should think it was pretty silly.|- Aunt Maria's right.
{36941}{37001}Whoever he is,|he'll have to do better than that.
{37005}{37059}Let me see the card, Maria, please.
{37100}{37164}- What are you two whispering about?|- Well, l...
{37168}{37240}I was saying that if that note|didn't warm Maria's heart...
{37244}{37319}...the next one, I believe,|may well start a flame within her.
{37323}{37396}Why, Eduardo, you remind me|of our courting days.
{37401}{37469}He was always telling me|how I lit a flame in him.
{37473}{37522}Sometimes I wonder|if it hasn't gone out.
{37526}{37580}I'll have you know that|I'm twice the man I was.
{37584}{37662}I would settle for half the man|you were, dear.
{37971}{38016}Here are the love lyrics you wanted.
{38020}{38085}The love songs and|the great love letters of Napoleon.
{38089}{38140}Just put them down and get out.
{38357}{38389}Sorry!
{39403}{39461}Right on time, 5:00.
{39717}{39833}You know, Louise, I'm beginning|to wonder what he's like.
{40375}{40405}She's in love at last.
{40409}{40481}I'm going to wear Tony's ring|where everybody can see it.
{40485}{40554}Now we can be secretly engaged|and tell everybody.
{43209}{43284}- No orchids for almost a week.|- Sunk again.
{43289}{43352}I guess we'd better|put our rings back.
{43438}{43469}Hello.
{43473}{43544}Oh, hello, Papa.|When did you get back in town?
{43548}{43617}Just now. How's everything at home?
{43621}{43689}Oh, we're all right,|but Maria's in the dumps.
{43693}{43760}Maria, in the dumps? Why?
{43764}{43813}She hasn't received orchids all week.
{43817}{43881}No orchids all week?|How stupid of me!
{43885}{43965}I mean, tell her, of course, that|no one's been making a fool of her.
{43969}{44014}No, don't tell her anything.
{44025}{44092}Well, how does she know|the orchid sender didn't get sick?
{44096}{44201}Well, say hello to your mother.|See you soon. Goodbye.
{44451}{44522}Dearly beloved...
{44551}{44661}...although I have been|desperately ill...
{44672}{44722}...in my delirium, they...
{44726}{44857}In my delirium,|they told me I asked only for you.
{44906}{45013}Have you got my number?|3790.
{45039}{45087}This time, he's shaving.
{45091}{45155}No, don't bring|a lottery ticket in here.
{45159}{45213}I can escape to the lobby|for a moment.
{45217}{45306}- I'll see you there. Right now.|- Did you give him my message?
{45310}{45400}Yes, and he said to have you arrested|for trespassing if you came in again.
{45404}{45480}Mr. Davis, give up.|He'll never see you.
{45484}{45567}{y:i}Fernando. Send a bellboy|{y:i}in here immediately.
{45969}{45999}Mr. Acuna?
{46003}{46049}There's money|and a note on my desk.
{46053}{46101}Take them,|buy two magnificent orchids...
{46105}{46196}...attach the note, then take the|flowers to my home. Is that clear?
{46230}{46289}Yes, sir. But first, could I see...?
{46293}{46392}Hurry it up! This is an emergency.|And bring back the change.
{46408}{46441}Yes, sir.
{46452}{46498}I'll be back.
{46736}{46783}"Dearly beloved, dearly beloved...
{46787}{46852}...dearly beloved, dearly beloved."
{46856}{46933}- I wouldn't take it so hard.|- I'm not taking anything hard.
{46937}{47045}Beware of note writers who haven't|the courage to court you face to face.
{47164}{47241}Even my clock's slow.
{47321}{47374}No, it isn't. Look, dear. Look.
{47901}{47976}"For Miss Maria Acuna."|Thank you, sir.
{47980}{48064}Thank you with all my heart and soul.
{48092}{48156}You're an angel.
{48400}{48499}Hoist the anchor, Cecy,|we're in again.
{48597}{48684}You know, I think|I've seen him before.
{48801}{48886}Louise, would you be a darling and|pick up the pieces of notes I tore up?
{48890}{48935}Yes, yes.
{49003}{49070}"Dearly beloved..."
{49172}{49221}Jumping blue blazes!
{49225}{49305}Can't you even order a teapot|for that hotel without calling me?
{49309}{49393}Why do I put up with it?|All right, all right.
{49397}{49441}Maybe I can fly up next week.
{49445}{49504}In the meanwhile, start looking|for another profession.
{49508}{49602}One that won't require the use of that|addled fraction of a brain of yours.
{49606}{49657}Mr. Acuna, here's your change.
{49661}{49733}Two pesos, 50 centavos.
{49737}{49816}- What are you doing here?|- I delivered the orchids for you...
{49820}{49897}...now you're going...|- You delivered the orchids?
{49901}{50001}I'm not gonna try to figure out how|you substituted yourself for a bellboy.
{50005}{50076}Mr. Acuna, I've been trying for days|to dance for you.
{50080}{50177}You're the only man who's ever|refused to see my work, and I resent it.
{50181}{50229}Get out of my office!
{50241}{50321}Now, look, this is a matter of pride|with me. I don't like to dance, see?
{50325}{50384}I came down here to get away from it.
{50389}{50426}Shall I have you thrown out?
{50430}{50509}You can't talk that way to me.|Honest, I'm an important guy.
{50513}{50559}Now, you're gonna see me dance|and like it.
{50563}{50594}Oh, no, I'm not.
{50598}{50681}Oh, yes, you are. Take it, boys.|One, two.
{53858}{53951}- Well?|- Excellent. Beautiful.
{53955}{54018}But I don't want it.|Mr. Davis...
{54022}{54119}...you do something to me that results|in the most fascinating dislike ever.
{54123}{54200}- May I make an observation?|- You may make your exit!
{54204}{54303}Mr. Acuna, your overwhelming|graciousness bewilders me.
{54307}{54370}However, I bear no grudges.
{54419}{54473}When you change your mind, call me.
{54477}{54521}Out of my sight!
{54525}{54599}Thank you again for your welcome.
{54753}{54817}You let that jumping jack in my office.
{54821}{54903}You'll pay for this with every drop|of your anemic blood.
{54907}{54970}You nincompoop! You worm!
{54974}{55072}You're fired! Now get out and never|come back, you diddling dimwit.
{55076}{55120}"Diddling dimwit"?
{55167}{55223}Welcome home, Papa.
{55227}{55293}I could have sworn|I heard you swearing.
{55297}{55334}Why, I thought you were...
{55338}{55399}Aren't you looking extraordinarily|happy about something?
{55403}{55464}- I am happy.|- Couldn't be orchids, could it?
{55468}{55514}And I'll let you in on a secret.
{55518}{55589}I know who's been|sending me the flowers.
{55605}{55691}You do? Now, look, darling,|everything can be explained.
{55695}{55774}- What do you mean?|- Tell me what you're talking about.
{55778}{55825}The orchids, the notes.
{55829}{55883}- I know who sent them.|- You do?
{55887}{55952}- Well, you don't seem brokenhearted.|- Well, why should I be?
{55957}{56073}- I'm glad you're taking it this way...|- Tell me what you're talking about.
{56077}{56151}- Tell me who you're talking about.|- Oh, Mr. Acuna?
{56155}{56217}When you change your mind,|I'll be up in Room 920.
{56256}{56352}Oh, Papa, that's who|I'm talking about. He's the one.
{56356}{56406}- He's what?|- The one who's in love with me.
{56410}{56453}- He is not!|- Oh, yes, yes.
{56457}{56523}I saw him bring|the orchids this afternoon.
{56527}{56588}Oh, I remember.|He sang at the wedding.
{56593}{56661}I tell you, he's not the one|who's been sending you the flowers!
{56665}{56759}If he is, he's a pest!|He's not only a pest, he's a dancer!
{56815}{56913}- How wonderful. I love...|- He's not for you! He's out of work!
{56917}{56963}Then you give him work,|for me.
{56967}{57064}Don't tell me you could do anything so|ghastly as to get mixed up with him.
{57068}{57130}And to think I was cool to him|at the wedding.
{57134}{57195}I forbid you|to fall in love with this man!
{57199}{57269}And besides, it's too late.|He's going somewhere.
{57273}{57308}New York, I hope.
{57313}{57394}Well, maybe I can change his mind.
{57413}{57473}You should read what he wrote to me.
{57477}{57562}No. No, on second thought,|I don't think your heart could stand it.
{57566}{57679}- Anybody can write a love letter.|- I'd like to see you try it.
{57683}{57762}Anyway, he's not leaving|South America...
{57766}{57845}...if I can help it.|And I think I can.
{57849}{57939}- What was his room number?|- My mind's a blank. I've forgotten.
{57943}{57985}I haven't.
{57989}{58028}920, please.
{58033}{58089}You ask him to the house tonight.
{58121}{58200}What's gotten into you, Maria?|Nice girls don't act this way.
{58204}{58288}- Nice girls don't feel the way I do.|- Why, you're brazen.
{58292}{58322}How could I be...
{58326}{58385}...with a heart like an ice cube?|- I didn't say that.
{58389}{58493}That gleam in your eye has nothing|to do with ice cubes. It's predatory.
{58497}{58553}Maybe you're right.
{58565}{58621}- 920, please.|- All right.
{58625}{58682}When I've signed those papers,|I'll ask him.
{58686}{58737}You're a very sweet papa.
{58741}{58836}Oh, and I'll have to hurry.|I've only got three hours to dress.
{58857}{58895}Bye, sweets.
{58920}{58926}- Why did you have to tell him off?|- Don't worry, he'll come around.
{58926}{58996}- Why did you have to tell him off?|- Don't worry, he'll come around.
{59000}{59052}Oh, you don't know him.
{59056}{59147}You know, Acuna is the most|opinionated man in South America.
{59151}{59200}I'll show you.
{59497}{59536}See that nose?
{59541}{59616}That nose shows opinionation.
{60025}{60087}His ears indicate mulishness.
{60140}{60230}His forehead slopes like a tin roof.
{60273}{60378}- No intellect whatsoever.|- What about his chin?
{60382}{60453}Oh, his chin clearly indicates|weakness of character.
{60469}{60584}Handlebar mustache,|no sense of humor.
{60588}{60688}His droopy eyelids|indicate he's a dope.
{60693}{60755}Very flattering, Cugat.
{60844}{60929}- Oh, Mr. Acuna.|- The Sky Room is going to miss you.
{60933}{60986}In the meanwhile,|I will speak to Mr. Davis alone.
{60990}{61069}Sure, sure.|Will you excuse me, please?
{61194}{61267}Mr. Davis, I find myself|in an embarrassing position.
{61271}{61332}Think nothing of it, sir.|We all make mistakes.
{61336}{61404}- When do I start dancing?|- You do not start dancing.
{61408}{61460}- Didn't you come to see about...?|- One of my daughters.
{61464}{61586}The one you so gallantly referred to|as the "inside of a refrigerator."
{61590}{61642}But I'm afraid I don't follow you.
{61646}{61710}She thinks you're in love with her.
{61725}{61811}Would it be rude of me to inquire|if there's any insanity in your family?
{61815}{61886}And what's worse, she has the|illusion that she's in love with you.
{61890}{61976}- Oh, my. Poor child.|- It's not her fault. It's yours.
{61995}{62091}- I still don't follow you.|- You took her the orchids, didn't you?
{62095}{62164}Why, I left some orchids|at your door, yes.
{62168}{62245}But what's that got to do with the|idea I'm in love with your daughter?
{62258}{62351}She's been receiving orchids and|love notes from an unknown admirer.
{62372}{62453}- Then she thinks I'm the fellow?|- So you've stirred her imagination.
{62457}{62524}I don't want to stir her imagination.|I didn't write any notes.
{62528}{62587}Don't you think I know that?|I wrote those notes myself.
{62591}{62676}- You? Then there is insanity.|- No, there isn't.
{62681}{62750}All you've got to do is to|let her think you wrote those notes.
{62754}{62837}- I see. Then what?|- Then disillusion her.
{62841}{62897}- Tell her I didn't send the flowers?|- Of course not.
{62901}{62986}Her pride would be crushed. She's got|to believe that you admire her...
{62990}{63086}...and yet for her own happiness, she's|got to lose her infatuation for you.
{63097}{63147}That's easy. Just tell her I'm a heel.
{63151}{63212}I want her to discover that|for herself.
{63227}{63273}Yeah? How?
{63277}{63353}By being your own obnoxious self|when you come to my house tonight.
{63357}{63401}Oh, I'm coming to your house tonight?
{63405}{63443}To complete the disillusionment...
{63447}{63513}...you'll tell her you're sailing|for North America tomorrow.
{63517}{63596}But I'm not. I like it here.
{63604}{63664}I'll pay your transportation|and a bonus as well.
{63668}{63709}Thanks just the same, Mr. Acuna.
{63713}{63783}My only interest at the moment|is in your Sky Room.
{63787}{63883}If you do this for me, I'll give you a|contract to dance, at some future date.
{63887}{63943}Will you put that in writing|and leave the date open?
{63947}{63999}- Yes.|- Okay.
{64003}{64063}- What time shall I show up?|- At 9:00.
{64090}{64160}And don't stay too late.
{64248}{64329}- Something in my eye.|- A keyhole, no doubt.
{64333}{64414}- Until tonight at 9.|- And I won't stay too late.
{64554}{64593}Look what we found.
{64597}{64656}Is this your Robert Davis?
{64673}{64729}That's the one.|He brought the orchids.
{64733}{64780}He's "The Idol of New York."
{64784}{64817}I like his smile...
{64821}{64880}...and the twinkle in his eye.|- Remember Mama's advice:
{64885}{64932}Don't frighten him|with your intelligence.
{64936}{65023}- Just act simple and mysterious.|- I know, make an entrance.
{65027}{65084}Be casual, as though|I didn't know he was coming.
{65088}{65154}That's right. Come on, Cecy.
{65273}{65315}Eduardo.
{65390}{65456}- Do I look all right?|- You're as beautiful as ever, my dear.
{65460}{65519}It just takes longer now.
{65523}{65567}Ouch!
{65571}{65649}Oh, I forgot. I had a pin in my mouth.|Did it go in very deep?
{65653}{65721}I'll probably look like|a Ubangi by midnight.
{65733}{65778}Hurry, it's 9:00.
{65806}{65874}If you giggle again, I'm going to|throw cold water in your face.
{65878}{65943}You think Mr. Davis wants to marry|into a family of gigglers?
{65947}{66019}Maria won't marry this young man.|She's not going to like him.
{66023}{66076}He has absolutely no good qualities.
{66080}{66149}That's not for you to decide.
{66153}{66248}I read in a book that a salmon swims|miles and miles to find a mate...
{66253}{66296}...and Maria has swum long enough.
{66300}{66368}Maria is going to wait|until the right man comes along.
{66372}{66441}Why should she? I didn't.
{66551}{66636}Oh, it's Mr. Davis. He can't meet us|scattered around the hall.
{66641}{66708}- Hurry, Mama.|- Come on.
{66827}{66899}- Good evening, Mr. Acuna.|- Mr. Davis.
{66903}{66963}- Did you receive the contract?|- Yes, sir.
{66967}{67010}Then I can depend on you?
{67014}{67078}Don't worry, she'll be disillusioned.
{67302}{67368}Maria, may I present|Mr. Robert Davis.
{67373}{67450}- We've met before, haven't we?|- Yes. No.
{67454}{67506}That is... In a way, but...
{67510}{67558}We will translate|that remarkable statement...
{67562}{67645}...after you've met|the rest of the family.
{67765}{67833}This is Mrs. Acuna.|My daughters Cecy and Lita.
{67837}{67912}Mr. Robert Davis.|He can't stay long.
{67917}{67992}Sit down, Mr. Davis.
{68161}{68260}I accidentally read|one of your beautiful notes to Maria.
{68274}{68367}It's a shame that such a talented|young man is unemployed, Eduardo.
{68371}{68416}Oh, but didn't Mr. Acuna tell you?
{68420}{68480}I'm to dance in his Sky Room|starting tomorrow night.
{68485}{68565}- Isn't that so, Mr. Acuna?|- The date was left open.
{68569}{68646}- But you meant tomorrow, didn't you?|- Oh, of course he did.
{68650}{68738}And you're going to love|working for Papa. Isn't he?
{68742}{68850}Oh, I'm sure I will.|Oh, I almost forgot.
{68857}{68920}These are for you.|There's no note this time, because...
{68925}{69021}I'd rather you'd say|what you might have written anyway.
{69401}{69490}- Do you mind if I smoke?|- Oh, of course not.
{69494}{69544}No, thank you.
{69649}{69705}Have I said something wrong?
{69709}{69750}He thinks it's real.
{69754}{69825}I had it made|into a cigarette lighter, Mr. Davis.
{69829}{69897}Oh, I see.|For a moment, it looked real.
{69901}{69976}Oh, I guess it's killed|many a man in its day...
{69980}{70027}...but it's only an antique now.
{70031}{70090}But you wouldn't mind|pointing it that way a little bit?
{70094}{70189}- Of course not, but it's harmless.|- Oh, I'm sure it is.
{70290}{70337}Do you mind?|I could stand a little air.
{70341}{70391}There's lots of it in the garden.
{70395}{70446}Remember?
{70450}{70498}- What if I'd killed him?|- Never mind him.
{70502}{70542}What about the vase?
{70558}{70635}Oh, now he'll never get back|into a romantic mood.
{70639}{70728}Maybe some music would|quiet his nerves. Come on.
{70922}{70995}After my notes, I must be|an awful disappointment to you.
{70999}{71035}Oh, on the contrary.
{71039}{71088}I like modest men.
{71112}{71178}Well, I don't know exactly|how to tell you, but...
{71182}{71234}I like bashfulness too.
{71355}{71467}Your city is so cosmopolitan, and this|shack of yours is so magnificent...
{71471}{71548}...frankly, I feel like|a duck out of water.
{71552}{71605}I think you'd fit in anyplace.
{71609}{71692}But I mean, I wouldn't fit into|this kind of life, your kind of life.
{71697}{71751}I don't like it much either.
{71755}{71815}But you don't know my kind of life.
{71819}{71881}- It's music and dancing, isn't it?|- Yes.
{71885}{71961}Well, we love your North American|music and dances down here.
{71965}{72054}Oh, but imagine a man like me|having to dance for a living.
{72058}{72112}I can't imagine a happier way|to earn one.
{72162}{72210}There's a great weakness|in my character.
{72214}{72282}- I'm a sucker for a horserace.|- They thrill me too.
{72286}{72367}I'd probably bet my last cent on|a horse. As a matter of fact, I did.
{72371}{72432}I have a gambler's heart myself.
{72437}{72467}You know...
{72471}{72558}...I think that's why|your notes intrigued me so.
{72589}{72658}Look, little lady,|as they'd say in Brooklyn:
{72662}{72768}"I can't bat in your league." I'm a plain,|ordinary guy from Omaha, Nebraska.
{72772}{72845}Just an old-fashioned,|everyday Middle Westerner.
{72849}{72930}Why, my grandfather|was a cattle raiser.
{72934}{72976}So was mine!
{73005}{73053}But you're streamlined. You're today.
{73057}{73184}Sister, I was raised amongst the|grasshoppers. I am strictly from corn.
{73281}{73368}{y:i}I am not such a clever one
{73373}{73463}{y:i}About the latest fads
{73467}{73565}{y:i}I admit, I was never one
{73569}{73688}{y:i}Adored by local lads
{73692}{73825}{y:i}Not that I ever try to be a saint
{73888}{73938}{y:i}I'm the type
{73942}{74039}- {y:i}That they classify as quaint|- {y:i}Quaint
{74043}{74073}{y:i}That they mother you
{74077}{74118}{y:i}Quaint that they brother you
{74122}{74169}{y:i}Must be another you
{74173}{74228}{y:i}I like the other you
{74233}{74328}{y:i}I'm old-fashioned
{74332}{74421}{y:i}I love the moonlight
{74425}{74472}{y:i}I love
{74476}{74615}{y:i}The old-fashioned things
{74619}{74706}{y:i}The sound of rain
{74710}{74800}{y:i}Upon a window pane
{74804}{74873}{y:i}The starry song
{74877}{75008}{y:i}That April sings
{75014}{75094}{y:i}This year's fancies
{75098}{75198}{y:i}Are passing fancies
{75202}{75312}{y:i}But sighing sighs|{y:i}Holding hands
{75317}{75468}{y:i}These my heart understands
{75494}{75565}{y:i}I'm old-fashioned
{75569}{75644}{y:i}But I don't mind it
{75649}{75770}{y:i}That's how I want to be
{75774}{75918}{y:i}As long as you agree
{75925}{76076}{y:i}To stay old-fashioned
{76080}{76177}{y:i}With me
{79844}{79886}It's getting late, Mr. Davis.
{80040}{80155}- It's your play, Eduardo.|- Well, I don't want that card.
{80176}{80233}Rummy.
{80515}{80597}Am I the first girl you never kissed?
{80646}{80724}I knew a fellow once who came|to a lull like this with a girl and...
{80728}{80775}Yes?
{80779}{80838}He didn't know what to say.
{80855}{80940}I heard of a man once|who was in love with a girl...
{80945}{81014}...and afraid to say so.
{81192}{81243}Cugat. I promised to meet him.
{81247}{81323}I almost forgot. You'll forgive me|if I go, won't you?
{81327}{81406}- Of course.|- I'm awfully sorry. I promised to see...
{81433}{81488}Good night.
{81548}{81601}- Why, he's leaving.|- Good.
{81616}{81667}Mr. Davis.
{81671}{81730}- Doesn't Maria dance beautifully?|- Yes.
{81734}{81776}You should've seen her|dressing for you.
{81781}{81836}No dress was good enough,|even though she has dozens.
{81841}{81926}- Not that she's extravagant, Mr. Davis.|- I'm sure she's not. Good night, girls.
{81930}{81992}When Mama was away once,|Maria ran the house herself.
{81996}{82065}- Papa said the bills were cut in half.|- And what meals we had!
{82069}{82142}- Maria majored in domestic science.|- She did?
{82146}{82221}Everyone remarks on what|a perfect wife she'll make.
{82225}{82296}I agree. Absolute...|If I could just have my hat.
{82300}{82364}- Oh, of course.|- You must forgive the girls...
{82368}{82448}...they're just anxious for Maria|to get married so they can be married.
{82452}{82525}- Well, thank you very much...|- They don't need to worry any longer.
{82529}{82634}- I'd say Maria's falling in love.|- We'd miss her if she left.
{82638}{82699}We'd be willing to make the sacrifice|for her happiness.
{82703}{82758}Thanks. It's been so nice.
{82788}{82852}- Leaving so soon, Mr. Davis?|- Yes.
{82856}{82899}But I hate to.
{82903}{82964}- Good night.|- Good night.
{82968}{83037}- Thanks a lot.|- Oh, you're very welcome.
{83041}{83098}Will you three stop interfering|with Maria's life?
{83102}{83145}Will you leave that to me?
{83149}{83213}- Oh, Maria!|- Oh, Maria!
{83232}{83295}- Isn't he just wonderful?|- How'd you make out?
{83299}{83375}The first time in my life I ever|really wanted a man to kiss me...
{83379}{83455}...and he had something else to do.
{83475}{83539}But the next time,|it's going to be different.
{83584}{83652}Eduardo, did you hear that?
{83695}{83753}- Hi, Fernie.|- Oh, no. Over my dead body.
{83757}{83886}- I'm not going to get fired again today.|- Must you clutter up the doorway?
{83900}{83965}- You betrayed me last night.|- Me? How?
{83969}{84032}By deliberately concealing|your true and obnoxious nature...
{84037}{84099}...and making yourself be charming.|- I did not.
{84103}{84165}Maybe there is insanity|in the female branch of the family.
{84169}{84220}They've conceived|a misguided affection for you.
{84225}{84323}- They think I'm in love with Maria.|- The mention of love between you...
{84327}{84373}...makes my flesh creep.
{84403}{84481}How you can be the father of such|a lovely girl absolutely amazes me.
{84485}{84563}- I resent that remark.|- I resent how you butt into her life.
{84567}{84622}But you have absolutely|no right to resent anything.
{84626}{84697}Mr. Acuna, I've arranged to fly back|to New York by the next plane.
{84701}{84768}- You've what?|- You can tear up that contract.
{84772}{84839}- I've decided to beat it.|- Oh, you have? Just like that?
{84843}{84921}Yes, sir, I'm going to dump|your entire asinine predicament...
{84925}{84976}...right back into your lap.
{84981}{85060}Oh, I see. You want them to think|that I forced you to leave.
{85065}{85109}Isn't that exactly what you're doing?
{85113}{85202}You want Maria to think you're a|martyr, sacrificed on the altar of love.
{85214}{85309}That idiotic statement didn't come|from your wife's side of the family.
{85313}{85373}Mr. Davis, you signed|a binding contract with me.
{85377}{85428}You'll stay here,|or I'll file an injunction.
{85432}{85478}- Yesterday, you wanted...|- That was before...
{85482}{85556}...your hideous display of charm|last night. Now I have a new plan.
{85561}{85616}You will live up to your contract|in the Sky Room...
{85621}{85712}...but you will keep away from Maria.|- Is that supposed to be brilliant?
{85716}{85788}That will let her know that you|merely used her to get the contract.
{85793}{85853}Naturally, then, she will loathe you.
{85857}{85917}That's just dandy. Then what?
{85925}{85980}Then, to show you how little|you've meant to her...
{85984}{86083}...she will immediately fall in love|with a more acceptable young man.
{86087}{86172}One of many whom I will invite|to my home in the immediate future.
{86176}{86263}- You think she'll fall in love quickly?|- Mr. Davis...
{86267}{86368}...I have an instinct about emotional|responses of the feminine heart.
{86402}{86465}Don't you think|I ought to explain to Maria that...?
{86469}{86502}No.
{86521}{86562}- Why, I thought perhaps...|- No.
{86566}{86655}Our mutual aim|is that she loathe you, isn't it?
{86659}{86718}I guess so.
{86790}{86840}- I was just thinking...|- No.
{86845}{86908}You do the dancing,|I'll do the thinking.
{87177}{87264}Fernando, in making out the guest list|for the wedding anniversary ball...
{87268}{87330}{y:i}... I wanna include the most|{y:i}outstanding and charming men...
{87334}{87377}{y:i}... who have ever been guests|{y:i}in my home.
{87381}{87417}Yes, sir.
{87421}{87486}Wait a minute!|I thought I discharged you yesterday!
{87496}{87609}Mrs. Acuna told me to forgive|your display of temper, so I have.
{87613}{87666}I forgive you, Mr. Acuna.
{87670}{87714}Oh, thank you very much.
{87718}{87788}Not at all, sir.|I'll prepare the list.
{87832}{87896}"Mr. and Mrs. Acuna request|the pleasure of your company...
{87900}{87959}...at the 25th anniversary|of their wedding.
{87964}{88016}Fancy dress."
{88021}{88080}I can't believe|it's been 25 years, Delfina.
{88085}{88150}That's because|you aren't married to Eduardo.
{88154}{88228}I might have been|if you hadn't seen him first.
{88233}{88284}- Where's Maria?|- Tennis lesson.
{88289}{88324}But her mind isn't on the ball.
{88329}{88437}She's still trying to figure out why|Mr. Davis didn't kiss her, I guess.
{88441}{88496}- Oh, hello, Fernando.|- Good afternoon, Lita...
{88500}{88595}...Mrs. Acuna, Castro, Cecy.
{88599}{88688}Mr. Acuna sent me with his approved|list of young men he wishes invited.
{88693}{88768}- Oh, swell!|- Let me see.
{88837}{88927}I don't see Mr. Davis' name here,|Fernando. Mr. Robert Davis.
{88931}{89025}It seems that Mr. Robert Davis|is not on Mr. Acuna's approved list.
{89033}{89077}He's the only one on my list.
{89081}{89112}- Hello, Aunt Maria.|- Hello.
{89116}{89170}- Fernando.|- Hello.
{89174}{89234}Do you know why Papa|left Mr. Davis off the list?
{89238}{89309}He said something about Mr. Davis|devoting himself to the Sky Room...
{89313}{89389}...from now, henceforth.|- Thank you, Fernando.
{89393}{89444}You know, we're expecting you|at the celebration.
{89449}{89530}Thank you, Mrs. Acuna.|You honor me. Sweet.
{89534}{89584}- Bye.|- Goodbye, Fernando.
{89588}{89693}I'd be interested in meeting|your Robert Davis, Maria.
{89697}{89752}Well, I haven't a thing to do|right now.
{89756}{89830}How nice. Neither have I.
{89997}{90048}A little faster, Cugie, please.|Once more.
{90052}{90092}One, two.
{90248}{90300}Hold it.
{90434}{90469}Well, hello.
{90473}{90542}- Does your father know you're here?|- No, why should he?
{90546}{90609}- Mrs. Castro, may I present...|- Why, I remember you.
{90613}{90728}- So you're Maria's Robert.|- Yes... Well, I don't know. Am I?
{90732}{90776}Won't you come in and sit down?
{90780}{90840}We are special emissaries|from Mr. and Mrs. Acuna.
{90845}{90929}We're asking the pleasure of your|company on Wednesday evening.
{90933}{90990}- Thank you.|- At 9 p.m., but...
{90994}{91077}...you can come earlier if you like.
{91081}{91137}Are you sure Mr. Acuna|wants me to come?
{91141}{91207}Oh, he'd be devastated if you didn't.
{91211}{91244}And so would I.
{91248}{91333}You were coming back|in half an hour, weren't you, Auntie?
{91405}{91500}Oh, yes, in a half an hour. Goodbye.
{91568}{91645}Won't you sit down?
{91729}{91815}Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
{91819}{91884}We were just running over|a little thing from Harlem.
{91889}{91942}But I don't suppose|you've heard of Harlem here.
{91946}{92017}Isn't that where the zoot suit|with the reet pleat comes from?
{92078}{92112}Yeah.
{92117}{92184}- I'd like to hear it. May I?|- Certainly.
{92188}{92223}Oh, Cugie, let's have it.
{92345}{92397}{y:i}Just heard of the Shorty George
{92401}{92460}{y:i}Got word of the Shorty George
{92464}{92516}{y:i}Seems that it's a kind of jig
{92520}{92611}{y:i}Named for someone about so big
{92638}{92692}{y:i}He rambles around the town
{92696}{92754}{y:i}Preambles around the town
{92758}{92809}{y:i}Then steps on a crowded street
{92813}{92856}{y:i}And beats his feet till his feet is beat
{92861}{92916}{y:i}Watch him go
{92920}{92975}{y:i}And he can
{92979}{93028}{y:i}Like a real
{93033}{93109}{y:i}Natural man
{93113}{93163}{y:i}High stepper is Shorty George
{93167}{93232}{y:i}Black pepper is Shorty George
{93236}{93280}{y:i}He dances to pay the rent
{93284}{93370}{y:i}And to see that you're solid sent
{93391}{93514}{y:i}Say, mister, can you spare a penny?
{93518}{93632}{y:i}Lady, can you spare a dime?
{93637}{93755}{y:i}He makes|{y:i}I don't know how many
{93759}{93864}{y:i}Because he's dancing all the time
{93873}{93984}{y:i}Papa's dressed up mighty sporty
{93988}{94098}{y:i}Mama's snoozing in the shade
{94105}{94204}{y:i}But while Mama's catching 40
{94220}{94300}{y:i}Shorty sees the rent is paid
{94340}{94391}{y:i}Get hip to the Shorty George
{94395}{94455}{y:i}Hop, skip to the Shorty George
{94460}{94498}{y:i}Directions are short and sweet
{94502}{94564}{y:i}I know you'll beat your feet|{y:i}Until your feet is beat
{98357}{98396}Are you sure he's coming?
{98419}{98452}Does Papa know?
{98470}{98514}Do you think he'll propose tonight?
{98518}{98583}Well, if he doesn't,|it won't be my fault.
{98610}{98646}Maria!
{98851}{98904}My, isn't Papa handsome?
{98909}{98988}Just think, Papa, you've been|married longer than we've lived.
{98993}{99080}Well, I consider that a very fortunate|coincidence, my dear.
{99111}{99147}Maria.
{99164}{99228}It just occurred to me|that I neglected to ask Mr. Davis...
{99232}{99309}...to come to the house tonight.|That doesn't bother you, does it?
{99313}{99375}- Should it, Papa?|- It's just, I thought it unforgivable...
{99379}{99449}...that he didn't call on you|after starting his contract with me.
{99453}{99508}He hasn't sent|any more orchids, has he?
{99512}{99556}- No more notes?|- Nope.
{99561}{99608}- You don't seem upset about it.|- I'm not.
{99612}{99642}Well, that's fine.
{99646}{99696}There'll be some handsome|young men tonight.
{99701}{99740}I want you to have a happy time.
{99744}{99800}I expect this to be|the happiest night of my life.
{99805}{99894}That's a good girl. I knew you'd let Mr.|Davis know exactly where he stands.
{99898}{99964}Yes, Papa,|that's just what I intend to do.
{99968}{100020}Papa, Grandma's here. Hurry!
{100220}{100287}Thank you very much.|Very kind of you.
{100331}{100404}- Congratulations.|- Oh, Maria.
{100591}{100644}What's going on between|your wife and my husband?
{100649}{100702}They're always whispering.
{100706}{100760}This is a fine time|to suspect your husband...
{100765}{100798}...on your wedding anniversary.
{100821}{100864}Well, I don't know.
{100927}{101016}You're such a fool,|and you think you're so smart.
{101020}{101056}Why, Maria actually|seemed happy...
{101061}{101131}...when I told her|I hadn't invited Mr. Davis.
{101303}{101334}Robert.
{101338}{101389}- Oh, Mr. Davis.|- We're so glad to see you.
{101393}{101435}Thank you.|Congratulations, Mrs. Acuna.
{101439}{101520}- It's so nice of you to ask me.|- We're happy to have you, aren't we?
{101524}{101588}- Delighted. Aren't we, Papa?|- Yes, indeed.
{101592}{101625}Congratulations, Mr. Acuna.
{101629}{101689}It gives us all an opportunity|to say goodbye to him.
{101693}{101723}- Goodbye?|- Goodbye?
{101727}{101792}He received an offer from New York,|didn't you, Robert?
{101797}{101868}- Well, that is...|- Insisted on taking tomorrow's plane.
{101873}{101915}Didn't you, Robert?
{101919}{101948}Yes, I guess I did.
{101953}{102014}- Oh, Mr. Davis, you can't!|- We won't let you!
{102018}{102093}I'm sure Mr. Davis|knows what's best.
{102097}{102176}- For him.|- You must induce him to stay.
{102180}{102248}I have no alternative. He asked me|to tear up the contract.
{102252}{102332}- Didn't you, Robert?|- Yes, sir.
{102352}{102397}Grandma wanted to meet you.
{102703}{102777}- Isn't she a lovely girl?|- I've never met a lovelier one.
{102781}{102828}Remember, I have|my own chapel at home...
{102832}{102896}...if you'd like to get married|without the usual Acuna fuss.
{102900}{102936}Granny, we...
{102941}{103012}You don't understand.|We have no use for a chapel.
{103017}{103114}We've just heard that Mr. Davis|is forced to leave us.
{103122}{103204}You chose exactly|the right word, Maria.
{103256}{103370}Our dear friends, 52 years ago|in a little village in Brittany...
{103374}{103426}...my beloved mother|and father were married.
{103430}{103488}When they came to South America|they brought a song...
{103492}{103529}...and a happy tradition with them.
{103533}{103587}This music was played|at their wedding...
{103591}{103648}...and 25 years ago,|at Delfina's and mine.
{103652}{103708}And now, in honor|of my beloved mother...
{103712}{103755}...and in tribute|to my charming wife...
{103759}{103823}...I have asked Mr. Cugat|to play that music for us tonight.
{104191}{104257}{y:i}Listen to the birdies|{y:i}Letting those squeaks out
{104261}{104330}{y:i}Puffing their cheeks out|{y:i}All around the place
{104334}{104406}{y:i}Little hurdy-gurdies|{y:i}Sounding so merry
{104410}{104480}{y:i}Getting so very blue in the face
{104484}{104612}{y:i}Surely there's a reason|{y:i}Everybody's gay
{104616}{104749}{y:i}It must be the season|{y:i}For a wedding day
{104753}{104820}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}The bells in the steeple go
{104824}{104885}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}Around the countryside
{104889}{104959}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}And off all the people go
{104963}{105020}{y:i}Off to kiss the bride
{105024}{105087}{y:i}All the donkey carts are driving
{105091}{105153}{y:i}To the wedding in the spring
{105157}{105224}{y:i}All the neighborhood's arriving
{105228}{105287}{y:i}To see the wedding ring
{105291}{105357}{y:i}Now they're forming in a column
{105361}{105424}{y:i}For the service has begun
{105429}{105545}{y:i}Although the padre's solemn|{y:i}He's the only one
{105573}{105641}{y:i}Down the aisle|{y:i}The page and the flower girls
{105645}{105702}{y:i}In a while|{y:i}The happy bride and groom
{105706}{105781}{y:i}The ladies smile|{y:i}We'll give her a shower, girls
{105785}{105835}{y:i}Dishes and a broom
{105840}{105971}{y:i}All the gentlemen are jolly|{y:i}For the wine is flowing free
{105976}{106102}{y:i}All the ladies melancholy|{y:i}For the days that used to be
{106106}{106168}{y:i}When the carriage|{y:i}That's been waiting
{106172}{106240}{y:i}Takes the newlyweds away
{106244}{106385}{y:i}The crowd keeps celebrating|{y:i}Till the break of day
{106389}{106448}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}The bells in the steeple go
{106452}{106519}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}Around the countryside
{106523}{106588}{y:i}Ding-dong dell|{y:i}Toast the bride
{106592}{106649}{y:i}Then farewell|{y:i}Off they ride
{106653}{106685}{y:i}Oh, what fun
{106689}{106790}{y:i}Comes under the heading|{y:i}Of wedding in the spring
{107935}{108021}Hey, you've got to make Davis|so jealous that he won't leave Maria.
{108025}{108087}If he takes a plane,|it's gotta be on a honeymoon with her.
{108092}{108131}Will you do it?
{108135}{108196}Well, well,|what are you waiting for?
{108495}{108591}Listen, old man, I started this dance|with Maria, and I'm going to finish it.
{108884}{108918}Go out there and cut in on him.
{108922}{108997}{y:i}Keep after him until he's so jealous|he can't stand it.
{109371}{109407}Help!
{109545}{109623}Mr. Davis, how dare you|attack a guest of mine!
{109627}{109694}- The jester was getting out of hand.|- And getting in my hair.
{109698}{109799}- I will not tolerate this sort of thing.|- It was our fault, we egged him on.
{109803}{109848}But falling in the pool|was his own fault!
{109866}{109941}Everything that happens|in the Acuna family is my fault.
{109945}{110032}I work long hours, I do as I'm told,|and where does it get me?
{110036}{110066}In the end?
{110070}{110166}Oh, so it's you!|You chose your costume well, fool!
{110170}{110217}Mr. Acuna, I have stood enough.
{110221}{110280}Fernando, I didn't know.|I guess it was partly my fault.
{110284}{110367}It's not your fault I'm distantly related|to this fuddy-duddy by marriage.
{110371}{110428}- What was that again?|- You will bark at me no longer!
{110432}{110500}I resign, and don't take advantage|of our family connections...
{110504}{110585}...to try to get me back again.|Fuddy-duddy.
{110626}{110709}Oh, let's tell the truth.|We were trying to help ourselves.
{110713}{110762}We're sick and tired|of being old maids.
{110766}{110811}We wanted|to make Robert jealous...
{110815}{110870}...so that he'd propose to Maria|before he left.
{110874}{110943}- You're wasting your time.|- Well, why?
{110947}{111037}Because I'm not in love with Robert|and he's not in love with me.
{111055}{111116}I think we've embarrassed|him enough.
{111240}{111278}Don't let it upset you, Robert.
{111282}{111363}Maria was bound to come|to her senses sooner or later.
{111368}{111421}{y:i}Kind of settles your problems,|doesn't it?
{111446}{111489}Would you mind|if I said goodbye to her?
{111493}{111543}Not at all, not at all.
{111548}{111583}Thanks.
{111597}{111633}Maria.
{111647}{111691}Why did you say that|to Robert out there?
{111695}{111727}What else could I say?
{111731}{111805}Everybody's trying go push him into|marrying me. Even Granny tried it.
{111809}{111864}If you ask me,|I don't think he needs any pushing.
{111868}{111904}Maria.
{111913}{111966}There's something I've got to say.
{111970}{112066}Take her in the garden.|You can say it much better out there.
{112096}{112176}The air's nice out there, remember?
{112408}{112456}I just wanted to say that...
{112517}{112572}Gee, you're beautiful.
{112608}{112644}It's funny, I had so much to say.
{112648}{112713}And now I can't think|of a darned thing.
{112824}{112855}Where was I?
{112872}{112934}You said I was beautiful.
{112960}{113012}Oh, yes, I did.
{113065}{113175}Look, would you mind turning|the other way, please?
{113182}{113216}Why?
{113241}{113323}I can't concentrate|when you look at me like that.
{113478}{113527}I was only kidding.
{113558}{113612}Oh, you're terrific!
{113705}{113757}What's the use?
{113861}{113994}{y:i}I was never able to recite a fable|{y:i}That would make the party bright
{113998}{114054}{y:i}Sitting at the table|{y:i}I was never able
{114058}{114119}{y:i}To become the host's delight
{114146}{114279}{y:i}But now you've given me|{y:i}My after-dinner story
{114283}{114436}{y:i}I'll just describe you as you are|{y:i}In all your glory
{114473}{114566}{y:i}You were never lovelier
{114570}{114655}{y:i}You were never so fair
{114671}{114760}{y:i}Dreams were never lovelier
{114764}{114837}{y:i}Pardon me if I stare
{114862}{114958}{y:i}Down the sky|{y:i}The moonbeams fly
{114962}{115044}{y:i}To light your face
{115048}{115101}{y:i}I can only say
{115105}{115225}{y:i}They chose the proper place
{115257}{115338}{y:i}You were never lovelier
{115342}{115442}{y:i}And to coin a new phrase
{115446}{115528}{y:i}I was never luckier
{115532}{115620}{y:i}In my palmiest days
{115624}{115736}{y:i}Make a note|{y:i}And you can quote me
{115740}{115820}{y:i}Honor bright
{115826}{115911}{y:i}You were never lovelier
{115916}{116008}{y:i}Than you are tonight
{116028}{116093}Is that what you wanted|to say, Robert?
{116097}{116150}Well, that's only the first part.
{116154}{116211}I don't quite know how|to tell you the rest.
{116215}{116306}Well, maybe I can make|it easy for you.
{116311}{116360}I love you too.
{116445}{116525}Oh, doctor, you've struck a nerve!
{116687}{116771}Well, Robert,|did you say goodbye?
{116775}{116847}Not exactly.|It was more like hello.
{116852}{116911}I can never say goodbye|to her, sir.
{116915}{116956}- I love Maria.|- You don't say.
{116960}{116999}Well, that's just too bad.
{117004}{117043}It would be|if she didn't love me too.
{117048}{117099}That's poppycock.|You heard what she said.
{117103}{117171}Yep, I was there. You weren't.
{117175}{117274}- You're leaving on tomorrow's plane.|- Yeah, but with Maria.
{117278}{117338}You'll do nothing of the kind!
{117348}{117411}Sit down, Robert, sit down.
{117470}{117542}This is going to hurt you,|and I admit, I'm sorry for you.
{117546}{117627}Maria isn't in love with you.|She merely thinks she is.
{117631}{117661}That's good enough for me.
{117665}{117727}- How will she feel when she finds out?|- Finds out what?
{117731}{117771}That you weren't|her unknown admirer?
{117775}{117857}That you agreed to deceive her|in exchange for a contract?
{117880}{117927}Well, that's not a very pretty way|to put it.
{117932}{117992}A woman doesn't mind you lying|when you compliment her...
{117996}{118067}...but she'd never forgive a lie|that made her a moonstruck ninny.
{118071}{118155}She's not. And I haven't been|exactly lying to her.
{118160}{118200}Besides, you got me into this.
{118204}{118293}Did you know that Maria|found a romantic ideal at 15?
{118297}{118335}- No.|- She did.
{118340}{118399}His name was Lochinvar.
{118414}{118463}You don't mean that fellow|on a white horse?
{118468}{118498}A sort of knight?
{118502}{118553}She cherished a dream|that she'd meet a man...
{118557}{118619}...that measured up to that ideal.|- I don't believe that.
{118623}{118656}She's a big girl now.
{118660}{118708}Have you taken a good look|at her lately?
{118712}{118769}At heart, she's still the same|romantic girl.
{118790}{118867}You were just an accident, my boy.|It might have been anybody.
{118871}{118928}Any man who arrived|when she was ready and waiting...
{118932}{119010}...for the lover who intrigued her,|who brought her orchids.
{119014}{119092}There'd come a day when|the illusion I created would vanish.
{119096}{119176}Suddenly, she'd see you|as you really are.
{119182}{119236}And that's...? That's bad, huh?
{119240}{119306}For Maria, yes.
{119321}{119362}Yeah.
{119427}{119458}I'm sorry.
{119462}{119548}I try to appear hard,|but I'm a fake, Robert.
{119552}{119596}At heart, I'm a sentimentalist.
{119600}{119644}I pity you, but I love my daughter.
{119648}{119708}I want to see her happy.|Don't you?
{119712}{119761}Of course I do.
{119782}{119852}If I go north, will you promise|that she'll never know...
{119856}{119947}...that I didn't send the notes?|- I give you my word.
{119951}{120012}It's just that I want her|to remember me...
{120016}{120049}...as she thinks I am.
{120053}{120086}I'll let her keep her memories.
{120090}{120149}As a matter of fact,|I'll compose a farewell note...
{120153}{120222}...that she'll treasure|as long as she lives.
{120254}{120302}It's best that I don't see her again.
{120306}{120352}I wouldn't know what to say.
{120356}{120432}I'll say it.|I'll break it gently.
{120436}{120482}Thank you, sir.
{120680}{120738}We're awfully sorry, Fernando.
{120742}{120782}We didn't mean to get you in trouble.
{120786}{120875}I'm going to insist that Eduardo|ignore his resignation.
{120887}{120917}Oh, Mama.
{120921}{120983}While you're there, will you|put in a good word for Robert?
{120988}{121041}Of course, dear.
{121110}{121145}"Dearly beloved...
{121149}{121235}...as long as my heart beats, I'll never|forget the softness of your lips...
{121240}{121288}...the pounding of your heart|against mine.
{121292}{121340}Yes, my dearest, darling Maria...
{121344}{121440}...I will always cherish the exquisite|torture of our stolen kisses...
{121450}{121499}...our sweet stolen moments together.
{121504}{121600}- Maria, my secret love."|- Maria?
{121612}{121680}You and Maria Castro!
{121684}{121737}Now I know what all that|whispering's been about.
{121741}{121839}- You bluebeard!|- Delfina, give me that note.
{121844}{121941}The "softness" of her...|The "pounding" of her...
{121945}{122028}To think that you,|lovemaking with Maria.
{122032}{122081}The godmother of your own child.
{122087}{122133}The wife of your best friend.
{122137}{122210}Writing a love note to her|on our own wedding anniversary.
{122214}{122266}- You wretch!|- Delfina, I can ex...
{122270}{122325}Don't try to change the subject.|Say something!
{122329}{122373}Delfina, give me that note!
{122377}{122456}I regret having to say goodbye,|Mrs. Castro. You've been most kind.
{122460}{122507}You'd better go into the library,|Mrs. Castro.
{122512}{122567}- Your name is being bandied about.|- What's that?
{122571}{122632}The pistols are on the table.
{122660}{122732}Retribution day is here. Acuna's|going to get what's coming to him.
{122736}{122787}- How? Why?|- He was caught red-handed...
{122792}{122862}...writing a love note to Maria Castro.
{122869}{122906}Maria Castro?
{122910}{123018}- I'm innocent, I tell you.|- Don't touch me, you scorpion.
{123025}{123104}Oh, Juan, we'll have to bear|this disgrace together.
{123108}{123159}And we have grown children.
{123164}{123229}This letter was written to your wife|by my husband.
{123233}{123289}Let the reptile's own words|convict him.
{123293}{123352}We caught him writing it.|He jumped like he was shot.
{123356}{123394}- Did he admit it?|- I admit nothing.
{123398}{123449}You keep out of this!|I'm talking to your wife.
{123453}{123515}I gave him the best 25 years of my life.
{123520}{123559}Do you deny you wrote this note?
{123563}{123618}I ask that my daughters|leave this ridiculous scene.
{123622}{123664}And I demand that they stay.
{123668}{123767}They'll learn a lesson in matrimony|they'll never forget.
{123773}{123844}Eduardo, I am a jealous man.
{123848}{123924}Will you please take that injured look|from your fat face?
{123937}{123991}- Did you write this note?|- Yes, I wrote the note...
{123995}{124081}I'm sure that Papa can explain|everything if you'll just give him time.
{124085}{124195}- Yes, if you'll just give me time.|- Well, we're listening.
{124214}{124253}Well, this isn't the time.
{124257}{124313}And what have you to say,|you brazen thing?
{124317}{124400}My dear, sweet, darling wife,|will you please shut up?
{124406}{124473}I'm not speaking to her again anyway.
{124477}{124552}If you wanted my husband, why didn't|you come to me and ask for him?
{124556}{124590}I don't want your husband.
{124594}{124648}There she goes,|laughing at me behind my back.
{124652}{124697}Beg pardon, Delfina, right in your face.
{124701}{124757}Oh, whispering women!
{124761}{124859}Going to his office every day,|and him, writing letters!
{124864}{124910}- He's a fiend.|- You don't know...
{124914}{124960}...what you're talking about.|- Don't argue!
{124964}{125026}If Delfina says he's a fiend,|he's a fiend.
{125030}{125100}- They're insane, Maria, both of them.|- I am insane, Eduardo.
{125104}{125183}It's an insane world when|my best friend and my own wife...
{125187}{125251}Eduardo, we must confess.
{125256}{125312}Did you hear her?|She wants to confess.
{125316}{125391}We'll confess nothing.|Not here and not now.
{125396}{125498}- You'll have to be patient.|- I'll have to be patient?!
{125510}{125571}Hold that gun.|It might go off, you know.
{125576}{125623}Now, look, I can explain everything.
{125628}{125699}Mr. Acuna was not writing that letter|to Maria Castro.
{125703}{125769}He was writing it to Maria,|his own daughter...
{125786}{125862}...as a farewell note from me.|- From you?
{125931}{126037}He wrote all the notes you received,|and he sent all the orchids.
{126041}{126083}I don't understand.
{126087}{126159}He just decided that Maria|should have an unknown suitor, so...
{126164}{126232}Is that true, Eduardo?
{126236}{126301}You were very considerate, Papa.
{126312}{126395}But how did you come into all this?
{126415}{126507}When I delivered the orchids, Maria,|you jumped at conclusions.
{126511}{126609}So your father had to ask me|to act as your admirer.
{126681}{126779}Well, how did you bring yourself|to make such a sacrifice?
{126784}{126829}The truth is, I wanted this contract...
{126833}{126916}And that's how Papa paid you|for being attentive to me.
{126920}{126988}- In a way, but later...|- Later you got tired of the assignment.
{126992}{127031}You got in too deep.
{127036}{127128}So Papa wrote a goodbye note|for you to send.
{127156}{127248}I apologize for all the embarrassment|this has caused you, Aunt Maria.
{127252}{127303}It was partly my fault.
{127307}{127386}I knew your father|was writing the notes.
{127437}{127529}Well! Everybody knows now.
{127533}{127596}I guess nobody had|any way of knowing...
{127600}{127686}...l'd make such|a complete fool of myself.
{127701}{127745}Congratulations, Robert.
{127749}{127854}I hope Papa paid you well.|You earned it.
{127858}{127898}If I had written the notes...
{127902}{127985}...I would have meant every word|your father said.
{128012}{128056}Please, Maria.
{128060}{128128}He's working overtime, Papa.
{128134}{128193}You should give him a bonus.
{128556}{128598}Will you ever forgive me, Maria?
{128602}{128690}She may, but all my life, I'll be|haunted by your frightful suspicions...
{128694}{128763}...that I could have been unfaithful.|- Oh, Eduardo!
{128767}{128868}Go and see that our guests are happy|and leave me with my conscience.
{128884}{128931}- Eduardo...|- Don't say anything.
{128935}{128986}I know, you're a jealous man.
{128990}{129086}- Remember, I warned you.|- I remember.
{129224}{129299}My boy, a woman's advice|isn't worth listening to...
{129304}{129389}...but any man who doesn't take it|is a fool. And that's me.
{129393}{129464}I've been pretty much of a dope|myself.
{129503}{129551}For some time,|it was a positive pleasure...
{129556}{129598}...for me to dislike you.
{129602}{129659}It gave me a nice, warm glow.
{129663}{129739}But now I must confess that I've|conceived quite a fondness for you.
{129743}{129795}What you just did smacked of nobility.
{129800}{129852}I didn't want to see you|shot full of holes.
{129856}{129917}Making that confession before Maria,|to save me...
{129921}{130007}...it must have been painful.|- It wasn't any fun.
{130012}{130072}Do you think she'll be all right now?
{130076}{130112}Thanks to my meddling, no.
{130116}{130172}I wonder if she'll ever forgive us.
{130176}{130281}Mr. Acuna, would you mind very much|if I didn't take tomorrow's plane?
{130285}{130327}You have my permission|to court Maria...
{130331}{130374}...as long as your strength holds out.
{130378}{130427}But I'm afraid it won't|do you any good.
{130866}{130938}If these orchids aren't out of here|by the time I get back, I'll...
{130942}{130977}I'll set fire to them.
{130981}{131048}Oh, Miss Maria, can't you see|how desperate he is?

{131347}{131416}What about the things you did|to make him fall in love with you?
