1
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,320
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

2
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,988
Lt's... It's better.

3
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,428
What's left of it.

4
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:25,905
Sorry.

5
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,937
We would like to speak with you
if you feel well enough.

6
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,270
Yeah, that's all right.

7
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,874
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

8
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:42,153
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

9
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,288
It's this...

10
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,058
It's some kind of factory...

11
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,097
...where these people,
these very rich people...

12
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,359
...they pay to torture and kill kids.

13
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,597
Mostly backpackers.

14
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,672
And they killed two of my friends.

15
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,284
They take you from this hostel...

16
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,989
...and they bring you
to this factory and...

17
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,362
I went there looking for Josh.

18
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:32,005
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and...

19
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,573
And they...

20
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,744
They killed him.

21
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,110
It was horrible.

22
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,624
He ask how you survive.

23
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,102
I...

24
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,045
I escaped.

25
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,051
Who organize this place?

26
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,630
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They...

27
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,226
They all have the same tattoo.

28
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,528
It's a dog.

29
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,261
It's a bloodhound dog.

30
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,545
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

31
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:57,949
Why?

32
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,503
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

33
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,105
...with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

34
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:25,612
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform...

35
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,950
...where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

36
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,648
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

37
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,132
You were on that tape.

38
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,772
Did his tattoo look something like this?

39
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,903
What the fuck's going on?

40
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,307
Help! Somebody help me!

41
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,186
Jesus.

42
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,297
You hungry?

43
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,799
Lt's 3:15 in the morning.

44
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,706
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

45
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,847
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

46
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,943
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

47
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,450
I'm not.

48
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,620
She still thinks her sors in Europe.

49
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,089
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

50
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,320
- She'll go straight to the police.
- Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

51
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:47,661
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

52
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,301
Somebody starts asking questions...

53
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,368
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

54
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:55,606
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

55
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,607
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

56
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,837
- You told your sister we were here?
- Yeah. So?

57
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,539
- Well, who else knows?
- No one!

58
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,218
Jesus.

59
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,844
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

60
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,388
Oh, Paxton...

61
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,716
Look.

62
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,729
I took you back because I felt bad.

63
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,665
But you're going crazy.

64
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:24,326
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

65
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,130
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

66
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,967
Paxton, that's not what l...

67
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:31,309
Oh, fuck.

68
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,303
Morning!

69
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,160
Paxton?

70
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,568
Hey.

71
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,321
Lorna?

72
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,180
Lorna?

73
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,894
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

74
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,065
Absorb.

75
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,531
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

76
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,036
Lf she did, it was in a Botticelli.

77
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,505
Oh, my God.

78
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,579
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time...

79
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,546
...I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

80
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,791
Until Tuesday.

81
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,394
Are you all packed for Prague?

82
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:38,997
- Jeans. No heels.
- Awesome.

83
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,690
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

84
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,995
I can teach you if you bring heels.

85
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,875
Axelle.

86
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,751
Hands on your pencils, boys.

87
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,770
- Would he ever?
- Excuse me, girls.

88
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,270
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

89
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,171
- May I see?
- Oh, they're just rough.

90
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,903
Show her. Don't be shy.

91
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,814
That's the one of you.

92
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,419
- Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
- Thanks.

93
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,112
How much would you want for it?

94
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,258
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

95
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,950
- Really?
- Yeah.

96
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,426
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

97
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,826
Can I buy you a drink or something?

98
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,470
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but...

99
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:53,003
- I don't know. Maybe some other time.
- Okay.

100
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,038
- Yeah! Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,643
- I'll see you.
- All right. Bye. Thanks.

102
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,319
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,388
It's not the Ukraine.

104
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,294
No.

105
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,596
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

106
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,233
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

107
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:25,394
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

108
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:30,202
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

109
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,343
What?

110
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,882
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

111
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,916
Okay, love you. Bye.

112
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,049
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

113
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,420
- All right, let's go.
- Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

114
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,358
Who?

115
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:52,489
- Yeah.
- No.

116
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,757
- Yeah.
- No.

117
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,595
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

118
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,430
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

119
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,836
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

120
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,669
She's not that bad.

121
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,886
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

122
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:24,890
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

123
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,622
For emotional callbacks.

124
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,795
Of course.

125
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,238
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

126
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,405
I'm okay. Thank you.

127
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,574
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

128
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,307
Knock yourself out, buddy.

129
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,106
See you later.

130
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,929
Excuse you. Asshole.

131
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,271
She's like a 20-year-old grandmother.

132
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,571
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

133
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,074
That's what she likes to do.

134
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,682
Oh, we didn't order these.

135
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,681
They're from girl.

136
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,015
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

137
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,322
Hey. What are you doing?

138
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,956
You inspired me to take a trip.

139
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,801
Watch this.

140
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,736
You've got to be kidding me.

141
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,376
Hello. What's your name?

142
00:15:56,423 --> 00:16:00,052
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

143
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,786
What do you need?

144
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:05,158
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like...

145
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,998
PCP?

146
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,499
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

147
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,865
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

148
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,640
Sure.

149
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:21,238
We go back to my car. I got some.

150
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:22,843
Yeah?

151
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,414
- Yeah?
- Okay.

152
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,393
Fuck. You know what?

153
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,931
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

154
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,708
- You want drink?
- No, I'm fine.

155
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,947
Hey, you know what?

156
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,284
Lt's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

157
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,427
No, stay.

158
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,688
I find them. Okay?

159
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,129
You smell nice.

160
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,037
- Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
- Yeah, we have our friend.

161
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,576
- You have friend?
- Yeah.

162
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,113
One, two, three, perfetto. Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?

163
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,450
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

164
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,955
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

165
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,457
What the fuck did you call me?

166
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,459
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

167
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,824
- Fuck you!
- You know what?

168
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,524
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

169
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,431
We'll come see you.

170
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,505
Are you fucking insane?

171
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,072
What? I fucking hate that word.

172
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,607
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

173
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,075
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can...

174
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,874
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

175
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:10,083
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

176
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,458
Some guy took my iPod.

177
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,853
What?

178
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,858
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

179
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,559
- Yeah. I'll go check.
- Okay.

180
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,663
It had everything.

181
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,371
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

182
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,736
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,338
Here you go.

184
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,287
It's those fucking guys.

185
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,592
The fucking guys, the Italian guys
from the room down the hall.

186
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,496
- What do we do?
- Just be quiet.

187
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,270
- Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,812
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

189
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,015
Oh, my God!

190
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,449
How did you know this was mine?

191
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,851
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

192
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,658
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

193
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,594
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

194
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:26,265
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

195
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,330
- Really?
- Yeah, we have an extra seat.

196
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,661
- Yeah, come in.
- Totally.

197
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,030
Thank you.

198
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,634
I think...

199
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,707
...we all need a little of this.

200
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,111
Oh, awesome.

201
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,675
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

202
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,809
Thank you.

203
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,519
As my father always says:

204
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,950
"Nazdrovia." To your health.

205
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,134
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

206
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,137
I kind of wanna go home.

207
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:13,802
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

208
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,879
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

209
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,778
So where are you going?

210
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,443
On a little spa vacation.

211
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:21,954
Where?

212
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:23,717
Slovakia.

213
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:26,154
Wait, wasrt there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

214
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,491
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

215
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:31,925
That's Bosnia, darling.

216
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,430
- Oh, like you knew.
- I did so.

217
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,158
What are the spas like there?

218
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,998
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

219
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:44,267
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the Italian guys.

220
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,808
They get to be a bit much.

221
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,004
Wow, hot springs?

222
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,582
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

223
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:56,313
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

224
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,720
It could be nice.

225
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:04,486
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

226
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,497
Okay, we'll go.

227
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:13,664
Do you know of a good place to stay?

228
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:20,035
- Smart move with the shoes.
- What? Lt's so easy. You have to try it.

229
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,639
Hi. Can I help you?

230
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,335
- I need a room for my friends, please.
- Yeah, cool.

231
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,537
Your passports, please.

232
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,545
American. Good.

233
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,485
Yeah, cool. It's 10 Euros for night.

234
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,750
No. I got this one.

235
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,223
No. It's on me.

236
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,693
- Thank you.
- Money.

237
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,692
Thanks.

238
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,434
Here are your keys.

239
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,600
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

240
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,642
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

241
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,678
It's Dozinky. I know that.
They have it every year.

242
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:32,574
- Yeah.
- Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

243
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,845
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

244
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,014
- It sounds kind of gay.
- Excuse me.

245
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,697
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

246
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:51,234
- Come on. This way.
- Thank you.

247
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,739
You're welcome.

248
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:59,510
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

249
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:24,236
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

250
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,337
Are you kidding right now?

251
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,566
Oh, my God!

252
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,674
Sexy.

253
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,413
Come here.

254
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,570
Yes! Yes!

255
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,542
Yeah!

256
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,978
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

257
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,270
Todd, what's up?

258
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,637
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

259
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:25,548
Really?

260
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:31,022
Wow, I didn't think...

261
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,059
Jesus. You sure?

262
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:41,225
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

263
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,593
Okay.

264
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,697
See you.

265
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,075
No respect for me.
No respect for mother earth.

266
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,151
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

267
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,423
Well, that's just fine.
We can all ride home in silence.

268
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:16,663
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

269
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,502
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

270
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,731
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

271
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,967
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is...

272
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:27,669
...and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

273
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:32,251
She comes back swinging!

274
00:27:32,452 --> 00:27:35,148
- Well-played.
- Thank you.

275
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,391
Dollar!

276
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,184
Dollar!

277
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,390
Do you guys have a dollar?

278
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,996
- I got it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

279
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:49,134
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

280
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,674
I have Smints.

281
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,339
Would you like a Smint?

282
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,619
Bitches!

283
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,393
Welcome to Slovakia.

284
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:33,970
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

285
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,239
Here are your pagers.

286
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:39,213
Perfect. Thank you.

287
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,117
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

288
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,290
Really?

289
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,960
Because you look like
your dog just died.

290
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:51,858
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

291
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,294
- All right.
- Thanks.

292
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,402
Oh, my God!

293
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,395
Hey, guys!

294
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:00,890
Yes?

295
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,994
For the apartment.

296
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,236
Awesome, dude.

297
00:30:05,438 --> 00:30:08,134
Those swords are like 1000 Euros.

298
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:10,468
Trust me, she can afford it.

299
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:14,345
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

300
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,013
No, it's more like an ineritance.

301
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,144
Her mom died when she was 12 and,
like, left her everything.

302
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,219
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

303
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:26,149
- Really?
- Yeah.

304
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,557
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

305
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,459
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

306
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,086
Yeah!

307
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,096
Badass.

308
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,360
Let me see this motherfucker.

309
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:17,136
You're up, bro.

310
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,648
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

311
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,282
Come on, man, sit down.

312
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,851
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

313
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:32,855
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

314
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,550
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

315
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,662
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

316
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:42,265
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

317
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,936
Is there some other option?

318
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:48,299
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

319
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,641
Yeah.

320
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,069
Let's do it. Come on, man.

321
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:53,302
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

322
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:56,173
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

323
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,373
Didrt seem like you had
any problem explaining...

324
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,916
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

325
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,611
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time...

326
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:05,989
Is there any problem here?

327
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:09,650
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

328
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,664
Stuart.

329
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:19,668
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

330
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,342
Get in the fucking chair.

331
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,613
Yeah.

332
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:41,285
Come on, man. Look at this.

333
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,922
I'm fucking proud of mine.

334
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,380
Look what I found!

335
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,579
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

336
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:09,948
...and those little kids right there
made it.

337
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,817
- Oh, my gosh, really?
- Yeah.

338
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,958
- I'm gonna go say thank you.
- Okay.

339
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,560
They don't speak much English.

340
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:23,467
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,396
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

342
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,162
Thank you.

343
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,675
Well, cheers.

344
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,843
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

345
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:39,745
Come!

346
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,857
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

347
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:08,637
There they are.

348
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:09,974
Three o'clock.

349
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,144
- Jesus.
- Right?

350
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,581
Lt's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

351
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,187
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

352
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:24,159
- Dude, where you going?
- In for a better look.

353
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:50,956
Me?

354
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,931
Hi.

355
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:35,793
Hi.

356
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:39,664
Would you like to dance with me?

357
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:43,107
No, thank you. I'm...

358
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,742
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

359
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:46,434
Come on. I'll show you how.

360
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,772
No, really. It's easy.

361
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:55,049
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

362
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,284
I could have helped you.

363
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,824
Excuse me?

364
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:11,903
Hey.

365
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,233
Hey.

366
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,068
That guy make you some troubles?

367
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,743
No. He's fine.

368
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,677
What he say to you?

369
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,414
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

370
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,848
He won't bother you anymore.

371
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,986
Oh, he wasrt bothering me.

372
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:41,793
Here. Take a drink.

373
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:52,472
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

374
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,015
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- Don't worry about it.

375
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,188
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

376
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,913
No, it's all right.

377
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,087
- Here, let me get you a drink.
- No, you don't need to.

378
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:09,625
- No, I insist.
- No, no.

379
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,557
I insist.

380
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,834
Beth! Beth!

381
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:26,478
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride...

382
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,613
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

383
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,544
...and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

384
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,687
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

385
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,186
Why not?

386
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,255
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

387
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:44,054
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

388
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:47,562
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe...

389
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,597
...we're all together,
we don't get separated.

390
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:52,032
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

391
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:03,971
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

392
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,848
Beth. It's okay.

393
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,352
- Okay. You promise?
- Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,189
Okay.

395
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,288
Roman.

396
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,030
Okay, two, please.

397
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:24,462
- Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
- It's okay.

398
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,036
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thanks.

399
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,736
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

400
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:38,344
Her. Firestarter.

401
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,041
And you?

402
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,683
I honestly don't know.

403
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:51,221
I'm sorry, there's probably...

404
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,365
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

405
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:58,195
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

406
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,395
You're not that ugly.

407
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,130
Really?

408
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,933
Well, cheers to that.

409
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:06,634
Cheers.

410
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,605
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

411
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,176
Yeah.

412
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,784
I get to listen to them have sex later.

413
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:19,013
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

414
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:23,054
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

415
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:26,390
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

416
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:31,432
That's... That's a long story.

417
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:34,269
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

418
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,474
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

419
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,666
...l'm sure we'll meet again.
- I'm sure we will.

420
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,640
All right. Good night.

421
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:42,239
Good night, Beth.

422
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:45,612
Did I tell you my name?

423
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:48,079
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

424
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,115
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

425
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,359
Good to meet you, Stuart.

426
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,417
Good night.

427
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,131
Lorna!

428
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:13,667
Lorna!

429
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,850
Lorna.

430
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,346
Excuse me.

431
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,924
Lorna!

432
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,493
Lorna!

433
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:38,663
Beth, I'm sorry!

434
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,603
You promised.

435
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:44,004
I know.

436
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,200
I'm sorry!

437
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,349
Lt's so peaceful.

438
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,586
It's so secluded.

439
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:37,721
Roman, what are you doing?

440
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,073
Come to me.

441
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,851
Close your eyes.

442
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:04,212
Roman! Roman!

443
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:09,050
Roman! Roman!

444
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:11,593
Roman! Roman!

445
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,543
- On a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

446
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:37,119
- How does she get back from that?
- Beth, come on!

447
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,188
Oh, fuck!

448
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,456
Beth!

449
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,494
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

450
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:50,134
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

451
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,303
- You go. Yeah.
- Yeah?

452
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,369
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

453
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,063
- Sure. Yeah.
- Thank you.

454
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,705
Fuck!

455
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,673
- Dude, are you coming?
- Are you okay?

456
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,574
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,612
- Are you all right?
- Dude, I'm fine.

458
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,975
Have another cocktail.

459
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,321
All right, good night.

460
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:16,187
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

461
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:17,657
- We are?
- Yeah.

462
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:20,991
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

463
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,396
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

464
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,400
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

465
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,573
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

466
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:32,569
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

467
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:34,803
Good night, Miroslav!

468
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,156
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

469
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:48,216
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but...

470
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,087
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

471
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:56,392
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

472
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,828
Do you have a AA?

473
00:44:01,273 --> 00:44:03,002
Mr. Rabbit!

474
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,499
Come here, Rabbit!

475
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:13,811
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

476
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,247
No, but I remember the last.

477
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:17,615
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

478
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:22,522
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

479
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:25,993
It wasrt anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

480
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:30,157
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

481
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:31,859
Exactly. Like an animal.

482
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:35,595
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

483
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,605
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

484
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,938
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

485
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,775
But like an animal, you can sense it.

486
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,209
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

487
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,013
And that's you after today, my friend.

488
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:55,284
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

489
00:44:55,494 --> 00:45:00,295
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

490
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:04,027
- Where's your pager?
- It's back in the room.

491
00:45:04,236 --> 00:45:06,500
- Come on. What the fuck?
- I just figured you had yours.

492
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:09,503
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

493
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,643
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

494
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:15,404
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it...

495
00:45:15,614 --> 00:45:20,142
- It's different from taking on an image.
- I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

496
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:22,650
It's time we fucking do it.

497
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:33,564
To the next level.

498
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:35,824
To the next level. No, wait.

499
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,865
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

500
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:41,937
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

501
00:45:46,645 --> 00:45:49,136
Yeah. Let the games begin.

502
00:46:09,668 --> 00:46:11,226
Hard, hard, hard.

503
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,097
Hey.

504
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:17,041
- Hey, did she call?
- No. I just checked.

505
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:20,476
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

506
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:24,046
- Hey, I tried.
- Keep trying.

507
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,375
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

508
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:28,553
Sure.

509
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,584
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

510
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,313
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

511
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,786
Thank God.

512
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:38,392
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

513
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:45,765
Please! Please!

514
00:50:45,977 --> 00:50:47,774
Please! Stop!

515
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,172
No!

516
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,974
Stop! Please! Please!

517
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,347
Please! Please!

518
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,254
Please, no!

519
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:32,909
Relax.

520
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:38,713
Come up here.

521
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,140
Whit?

522
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,757
Axelle?

523
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:46,240
Fuck.

524
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,111
Whit!

525
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,821
Guys!

526
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,421
Axelle! Whit!

527
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,943
Stop. Please help me!

528
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:48,635
- Go away.
- Please help me!

529
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,279
- Just go away from me!
- No, no, no.

530
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:52,649
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

531
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,650
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

532
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,447
Dollar, bitch!

533
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:38,456
Stop!

534
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,153
Get in.

535
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:13,863
Yeah.

536
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,911
The police will be here soon.

537
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,613
They are looking for your friends.

538
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,984
Thank... Thank you.

539
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,117
More tea?

540
00:59:57,528 --> 00:59:58,995
Please.

541
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:06,135
Thank you.

542
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,048
So, you and Sasha...

543
01:00:23,521 --> 01:00:26,922
...are you two...?
- Oh, no. God, no.

544
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,853
He's old enough to be my dad.

545
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,755
What does he do?

546
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,794
He does auctions.

547
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:37,666
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

548
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:08,528
No!

549
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,291
No!

550
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,499
Help! No! No!

551
01:01:34,392 --> 01:01:36,485
What did I do wrong?

552
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,821
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

553
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:45,431
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

554
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:47,831
I not hurt you.

555
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:50,538
Okay. It's okay.

556
01:01:50,741 --> 01:01:51,901
I clean you up.

557
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,244
Please, please help me.

558
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:58,104
You have a bruise.

559
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,709
What is that?

560
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,581
What are you doing?

561
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,257
I make you pretty.

562
01:02:09,627 --> 01:02:11,060
Pretty for what?

563
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:13,691
For the client.

564
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:16,158
Client? What client?

565
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,425
Give me. No.

566
01:02:45,663 --> 01:02:46,630
No.

567
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,858
We do...

568
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,669
...nails.

569
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,218
No!

570
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,397
No! No!

571
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,510
Oh, my God.

572
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:40,515
No!

573
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,223
I'm worried about Whit.

574
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:56,725
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

575
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,902
She'll be okay.

576
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:04,533
You have a scratch.

577
01:04:06,544 --> 01:04:07,909
Yeah.

578
01:04:17,555 --> 01:04:20,581
- It's sore.
- I'm sorry.

579
01:04:21,592 --> 01:04:24,493
You have such beautiful skin.

580
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:26,219
Thank you.

581
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,060
Who's that?

582
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,070
Just some friends.

583
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,535
Come. You should lie down.

584
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,708
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

585
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:41,026
Do you think we're sick?

586
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:43,726
Fuck, no.

587
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:47,198
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law...

588
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:50,601
...whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans...

589
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,833
...and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

590
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:56,979
We're the normal ones.

591
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:04,914
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

592
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:10,284
You don't even wanna know.

593
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:14,156
You don't even wanna know.

594
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:45,265
Jesus.

595
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,307
They're listening. They're listening.

596
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,876
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

597
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:06,155
Don't talk loud. Okay?

598
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:09,120
Lf they hear us talking like this...

599
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:11,154
...they're gonna fucking kill us both.

600
01:12:11,962 --> 01:12:13,054
You hear me?

601
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:15,394
I need to know you're listening.

602
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,592
Okay?

603
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,548
What the fuck are you doing?

604
01:12:35,986 --> 01:12:39,285
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

605
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:42,018
Stuart!

606
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:47,493
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

607
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:50,957
Well...

608
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:54,997
...this is what I'm doing here.

609
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,508
What is this place?

610
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,508
This place...

611
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:06,645
People come here...

612
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,113
People come here to kill people.

613
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:15,020
What? Who kills?

614
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17,927
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

615
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:19,689
Well...

616
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:22,631
...not...

617
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,061
...us.

618
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:27,302
Oh, my God.

619
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,966
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

620
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:33,336
- You're gonna kill me!
- No. No, no! No, no, no.

621
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:36,637
No. Jesus, no. No.

622
01:13:36,947 --> 01:13:39,245
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

623
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:41,007
What the fuck are you wearing?

624
01:13:41,218 --> 01:13:43,209
Someone brought me here...

625
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,149
...the same as you.

626
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,784
Someone I know.

627
01:13:49,126 --> 01:13:50,559
Look...

628
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,523
...he wanted me to...

629
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:55,391
To do this with him.

630
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:57,557
What?

631
01:13:58,001 --> 01:13:59,195
Stuart, please.

632
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:02,064
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

633
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:06,402
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

634
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,366
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

635
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:34,837
Fucking skank.

636
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:50,684
Oh, that's fucking rich.

637
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:53,820
You should see your fucking face.

638
01:14:57,761 --> 01:15:01,026
- We gotta get out of here.
- We can't.

639
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:04,063
They think you're gonna kill me?

640
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:06,763
You're not some monster.

641
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,803
- I'm not that guy.
- No.

642
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,235
No, I know.

643
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:15,002
- I know you're a good person.
- I'm not that guy.

644
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:17,838
I know. Of course not.

645
01:15:18,048 --> 01:15:19,811
I'm not that guy.

646
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:26,418
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm not that guy.

647
01:15:29,326 --> 01:15:31,260
We're gonna get out of here.

648
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:40,034
I'm not that guy.

649
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:46,666
I'm not that guy.

650
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,704
I'm not that guy.

651
01:15:52,816 --> 01:15:54,579
There must be a co...

652
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:19,534
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

653
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:38,254
Christ! Fuck!

654
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:40,427
God!

655
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:43,590
Fuck!

656
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:48,167
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

657
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:50,506
My wife?

658
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:52,402
My wife?

659
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,475
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

660
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:19,026
- Finish?
- Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

661
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:22,102
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

662
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,000
You go in room, finish.

663
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,208
You know what? I am fucking done.

664
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,877
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

665
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,673
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

666
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:33,508
I fucking paid!

667
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:35,514
You have my money
and you can keep it!

668
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:39,086
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

669
01:17:39,289 --> 01:17:41,154
Hey! Hey!

670
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:42,282
Hello. Special offer.

671
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:45,886
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

672
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:47,714
Do you want her?

673
01:18:52,595 --> 01:18:54,222
We'll let you know.

674
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:36,431
Six-fifty.

675
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:56,525
Yes?

676
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:01,895
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

677
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:03,429
Very good price.

678
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,102
Where's Todd?

679
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,148
Problem with friend.

680
01:20:28,558 --> 01:20:30,856
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

681
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,724
What do you think?

682
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:40,630
Should I do it?

683
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:43,067
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her...

684
01:20:43,273 --> 01:20:45,070
...in this kind of shape, but...

685
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:47,140
I mean, look at that.

686
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,208
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

687
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,580
You should see
what she did to my friend.

688
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,321
I'll take her.

689
01:21:41,331 --> 01:21:43,595
A souvenir from your friend.

690
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:55,802
Notice anything different about me?

691
01:21:58,548 --> 01:22:00,607
I bet you fucking do.

692
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:03,481
Fucking bitch.

693
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,384
Fucking respect me now.

694
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,661
I don't fucking work for you!

695
01:22:15,832 --> 01:22:18,960
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

696
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:23,832
To tell me I'm shit.

697
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:29,610
Never fuck me.

698
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:32,572
Look at you.

699
01:22:33,116 --> 01:22:34,413
What?

700
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:37,609
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

701
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:41,221
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

702
01:22:41,658 --> 01:22:45,150
- Let's fucking hear it. What?
- I'm not your wife.

703
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:49,127
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

704
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:54,830
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

705
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:58,201
- And I see how you're strong.
- I am strong.

706
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:01,138
- I am fucking Hercules!
- I see.

707
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:04,638
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

708
01:23:05,014 --> 01:23:06,413
I saw it last night.

709
01:23:06,616 --> 01:23:10,177
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

710
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:14,320
I thought about you all night.

711
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:23,525
Get on the fucking floor.

712
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,908
Are you scared?

713
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,871
You fucking better be.

714
01:23:41,584 --> 01:23:43,142
I am.

715
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:45,850
I like it.

716
01:23:59,969 --> 01:24:01,527
Look at me.

717
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:05,171
Bitch.

718
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,272
You fucking whore.

719
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,101
Get in the chair!

720
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,102
Get in the fucking chair!

721
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:43,778
Fucker!

722
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:02,131
What's the code?

723
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:04,296
Fuck you!

724
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:09,962
What's the fucking code?

725
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,372
- Your birthday.
- What?

726
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:17,375
What is your birthday?

727
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,514
December 12th.

728
01:25:21,184 --> 01:25:23,812
Oh, that is fucking sick.

729
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:42,036
What the fuck? Lt's not opening.

730
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,536
It's not fucking opening!

731
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:48,607
Oh, yes, it is.

732
01:25:49,879 --> 01:25:52,905
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

733
01:25:53,115 --> 01:25:55,913
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

734
01:25:56,252 --> 01:25:58,652
Kill her! Kill her!

735
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:03,653
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

736
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,851
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

737
01:26:06,062 --> 01:26:07,393
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

738
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:09,962
Get Sasha!

739
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:14,067
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

740
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,101
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

741
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:17,363
- Sasha!
- Get him!

742
01:26:35,224 --> 01:26:37,124
- Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
- Wait!

743
01:26:40,496 --> 01:26:43,488
- You can't afford it.
- Don't tell me what I can't afford.

744
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:47,863
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

745
01:26:49,005 --> 01:26:51,200
You going to call your parents
for money?

746
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:53,500
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

747
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,701
Just get me a PDA, a SWIFT number
and a recipient name.

748
01:26:56,913 --> 01:26:59,780
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the Isle of Man.

749
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:04,043
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

750
01:27:05,922 --> 01:27:07,446
Okay.

751
01:27:12,995 --> 01:27:14,121
We negotiate.

752
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:18,231
- This is bullshit!
- This is business.

753
01:27:18,534 --> 01:27:19,592
I'll pay more!

754
01:27:20,036 --> 01:27:22,004
Not with a second mortgage
on your house...

755
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:24,263
...and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

756
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,435
That's why your friend pay.

757
01:27:26,642 --> 01:27:28,507
What's the number?

758
01:27:29,645 --> 01:27:32,045
Money is not the only issue.

759
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:33,875
We have contract here.

760
01:27:34,684 --> 01:27:36,117
What kind of contract?

761
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:40,214
Anyone who come to this place...

762
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:42,050
...cannot leave...

763
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:43,816
...without killing.

764
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,287
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

765
01:27:49,699 --> 01:27:51,428
What did you say to me?

766
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:56,167
You're a stupid fucking cu...!

767
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:14,420
Let him bleed to death.

768
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:17,216
Misha, no!

769
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:59,767
Isn't this great?

770
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:08,372
Hey, get back here!

771
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:11,740
Wait!

772
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:13,847
Wait! Wait!

773
01:29:15,618 --> 01:29:16,710
Wait!

774
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:18,820
Hey!

775
01:29:19,255 --> 01:29:21,849
You fucking shit! Wait!

776
01:34:23,926 --> 01:34:25,826
Bitches!
