00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,453
"of the allegations,
the company and Bill O'Reilly

176
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,895
"have agreed that Bill O'Reilly
will not be returning

177
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,556
to the Fox News Channel."

178
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,329
Of course, this follows the
boycott of over 50 advertisers

179
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:32,739
of<i> The O'Reilly Factor</i>
after a<i> New York Times</i> report

180
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:35,269
of sexual harassment allegations

181
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:37,942
and the report that
Fox and O'Reilly together

182
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,779
spent about $13 million

183
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:43,310
to settle those allegations
from five different women.

184
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,543
-So, the story...
-Job well done, Emily.

185
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,819
Thanks, Dean.

186
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,480
And you, Mike.
Excellent reporting.

187
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,482
BOORSTIN: ...not be returning
to his top-rated cable show.

188
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,551
Are we talking solely
corporate misuse of power?

189
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,223
No, we're talking all workplaces

190
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:58,160
where sexual harassment
might happen.

191
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,590
Also, let's look
for the enablers.

192
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,998
Fox kept O'Reilly on

193
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,868
for quite some time
after our story broke.

194
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:04,199
And for decades before that.

195
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:05,464
EMILY:
The network only ousted him

196
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,169
when the advertisers
jumped ship.

197
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,501
Let's interrogate
the whole system.

198
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,877
Why is sexual harassment
so pervasive

199
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,407
and so hard to address?

200
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:16,310
(busy chatter)

201
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,180
JODI:
Hey, do you guys have a minute?

202
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:20,083
MATT:
Sure.

203
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,857
So, I spoke to Shaunna Thomas,

204
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,156
the head of UltraViolet,
a feminist group.

205
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:29,620
She said the wrongdoing
in Hollywood is overwhelming.

206
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,590
She's in touch with an actress,
Rose McGowan,

207
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,428
who has tweeted about
being raped by a producer.

208
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:37,727
Thomas says
it's Harvey Weinstein

209
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,235
and that McGowan is
now working on a book about it.

210
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,600
Wasn't he charged with
something couple years ago?

211
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,536
Yeah, um...

212
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,572
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez,
an Italian model.

213
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,575
She claimed Weinstein groped her
in a business meeting.

214
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,886
The NYPD investigated it,
but he was never charged.

215
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,415
Talk to Rose McGowan.

216
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,615
Try to talk to other actresses
he's worked with.

217
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,124
Yeah. And I'll try
to reach ex-employees.

218
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,865
JODI:
<i> Hi. My name is Jodi Kantor.</i>

219
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,801
<i> I'm an investigative reporter</i>
<i> for</i> The New York Times.

220
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:09,660
<i> We're looking into sexual</i>
<i> harassment in the workplace.</i>

221
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,267
<i> I believe you were</i>
<i> an employee at Miramax</i>

222
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,632
<i> and worked for Harvey Weinstein</i>
<i> in the '90s.</i>

223
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,601
WOMAN (over phone):
Are you recording this?

224
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,142
No, absolutely not, and I won't
quote from this conversation

225
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,671
without your permission.

226
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,640
But in your time as an
assistant, were you aware of

227
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,642
any instances
in which Harvey Weinstein

228
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:28,217
treated women inappropriately
or crossed a line?

229
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:31,418
Did Harvey cross a line?
(scoffs)

230
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,617
(line clicks)

231
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,719
Would you like to hear
her heartbeat?

232
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,029
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

233
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:40,460
(fetal heartbeat pulsing
over speakers)

234
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:44,464
JODI:<i> Mary, thanks so much</i>
<i> for calling me back.</i>

235
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,367
MARY (over phone):
Who have you talked to?

236
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:49,568
I can't tell you names, just as
I would never divulge yours,

237
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,109
but if you wanted to share
anything that you know,

238
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,979
that would be so helpful.

239
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,982
I don't think
people will want to talk.

240
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,115
Sorry.

241
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,479
(line clicks)

242
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,421
(laughs)

243
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:10,490
JODI:<i> Ms. Godrèche, thank you</i>
<i> so much for responding.</i>

244
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,492
JUDITH:
<i> Before you continue,</i>

245
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,560
<i> I've talked about Weinstein</i>
<i> in the past, but it's private.</i>

246
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:17,728
<i> My immigration lawyer does not</i>
<i> want me to be involved.</i>

247
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,499
(line clicks, beeps)

248
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,535
Involved in what?

249
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,044
(line ringing)

250
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,344
-ROSE (over phone): Hello?
-Oh, hi, Rose.

251
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,347
Um, this is Jodi Kantor
from<i> The New York Times.</i>

252
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:34,382
I wrote you an email.

253
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,681
Shaunna Thomas suggested
you might be willing to have

254
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,892
a conversation with me
about Hollywood,

255
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:41,290
and specifically
Harvey Weinstein.

256
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,655
-Are you writing about him?
-Yes, I am.

257
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,230
Look, I don't feel that inclined
to talk to you about it.

258
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,495
JODI:
Could I ask why not?

259
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,035
ROSE:
I've been treated quite shabbily

260
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,334
by your paper numerous times,

261
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:57,042
and I believe
the root of it is sexism.

262
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:58,604
I'm sorry
that was your experience.

263
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,212
I've talked in the past,
and nothing happened.

264
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:03,840
I spoke at
a political meeting recently,

265
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:08,086
and<i> The New York Times</i>
put it in the Style section.

266
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:12,156
It does damage to shout,
and no one listens.

267
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:15,456
I'm investigating
systemic sexism in Hollywood.

268
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,524
How many pages have you got?

269
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,822
No.

270
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,791
I put myself on the line before,

271
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,529
and it made no difference.

272
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:25,664
I've written about the
workplace at Amazon, Starbucks

273
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,767
and Harvard Business School,
and change did happen.

274
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,274
They reformed their policies

275
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,672
as a direct result
of the<i> Times</i> articles.

276
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,180
But if you don't want to talk,
I understand.

277
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:38,380
And good luck with your book.

278
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:41,119
Thank you. Goodbye.

279
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,849
RON:
I spoke to Dad.

280
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,686
He sounded worse.

281
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,855
I got to go see him soon.

282
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,197
Could you go for a long weekend?

283
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,430
You could take the girls.

284
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:58,103
I could take Talia
but not both of them.

285
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:03,801
(sighs)

286
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,638
I'm having an affair.

287
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:09,708
With a very famous actress.

288
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,447
You want her number?

289
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,452
(chuckles)

290
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:21,324
-She's so hot.
-(laughs)

291
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,293
This looks beautiful.

292
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:26,263
-You'd really like her.
-(laughs)

293
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:30,729
"I am a nasty woman.

294
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,138
(crowd cheering)

295
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:34,799
"I'm not as nasty

296
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,638
as using little girls like
Pokémon before their bodies..."

297
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:41,212
-Is that Ashley Judd?
-Yeah.

298
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:44,083
She wrote about
being sexually harassed

299
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:45,909
by a producer in the '90s.

300
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:49,781
She doesn't name him,
but she describes him as

301
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,686
"one of our industry's most
famous admired/reviled bosses."

302
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,193
Mm.

303
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,954
"...sexual assault, transphobia,

304
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:00,759
"white supremacy, misogyny,

305
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,135
-ignorance, white privilege."
-(Violet crying in distance)

306
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,137
-I'll go.
-I'll get her.

307
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,338
-TALIA: Mom!
-(chuckles)

308
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,604
-We'll both go.
-Yeah.

309
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,212
(voice breaking):
I don't know if I can do this.

310
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,642
(sobs softly)

311
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,645
VADIM:
You need to rest.

312
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:22,418
You try to sleep, maybe?

313
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,685
I don't want to be... (sighs)

314
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,623
I just have
this constant sense of dread.

315
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:30,921
(sobs)

316
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,890
You're tired.

317
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,991
Your body's exhausted.

318
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,795
(Megan sighs)

319
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,699
I think I would know
if it was just that.

320
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,273
(sighs)

321
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,871
-(phone vibrating)
-Mom.

322
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,221
Hello?

323
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,047
ROSE (over phone):
It's Rose.

324
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,588
-McGowan.
-Rose, hi.

325
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:03,360
It's not just him
you should be after.

326
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:06,429
There's an entire machine,
a supply chain.

327
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:08,959
Of abusers in Hollywood?

328
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,026
Right.

329
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,533
They're worldwide,

330
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:15,339
wherever movies are
being made or sold.

331
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:18,177
Each studio does
the victim-shaming and payouts.

332
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:22,445
If white men could have
a playground, this would be it.

333
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,845
Do people know about it?

334
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,517
Of course.

335
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:32,081
I told a lot of people
what happened to me.

336
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,358
At the Sundance Film Festival?

337
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:38,560
I was 23. I was doing all these
brilliant independent films.

338
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,991
I was just incredibly hopeful.

339
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,300
(door opens)

340
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,027
-And then I went
to that hotel room. -Hi.

341
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,798
(whispering)

342
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,997
(door closes)

343
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,768
RON:
Talia?

344
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,275
-I'm here.
-(door closes)

345
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,673
ROSE:
He was on a sofa,

346
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,280
talking loudly on his phone.

347
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,644
I waited.

348
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,745
And then
we talked about projects,

349
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,685
and he suddenly said,
"I have a Jacuzzi in my room."

350
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,160
I didn't know
what the answer to that was,

351
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:09,921
so I just kept talking.

352
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:14,024
We wrapped up,
and he said he'd walk me out,

353
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,434
and I thought,
"Well, that went well."

354
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,997
It was my first big meeting.

355
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:24,001
He walked behind me
down a hallway, then he said,

356
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,641
"This is the Jacuzzi room."

357
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:31,415
And I looked in,
and he pushed me inside.

358
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,619
He stripped me,
and he was suddenly naked.

359
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:40,754
I left my body in some way.

360
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:43,757
And he raped me.

361
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:50,236
I went into survival mode to
get out, and I faked an orgasm.

362
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:52,667
He told me to get dressed.

363
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:56,099
He left me messages telling me
I was his new special friend

364
00:18:56,134 --> 00:19:00,136
and that he'd done a lot
for other actresses.

365
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,006
Did you report it?

366
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,449
Can you see the law
taking my side on that?

367
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,113
But you told other people?

368
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:14,150
I told a lot of people,
and nobody did a thing.

369
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:15,855
Nothing.

370
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:21,157
Can I contact
the people you told?

371
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,401
You told me this was private.

372
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,406
He'll have spies
watching you now, as we speak.

373
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,672
I hope you know that.

I just got her down.

386
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:18,247
JODI: It's the toughest part,
I think.

MEGAN:
Is it?

388

JODI:
I found it to be so.

389
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:25,562
With my first daughter,
I had postpartum depression.

390
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:29,368
Everyone's so excited,

391
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:32,063
and it's like...

392
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,636
you're just not there.

393
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,672

Right.

394
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:38,740
(sighs)

395
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:41,204
So, I got your email.

396
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,414
How's it all going?

397
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,779
Yeah. (laughs)

398
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:49,586
I feel like there are
a lot of women who have...

399
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:52,523
been through something with him.

400
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:56,252
But they find it hard to talk.

401
00:20:56,287 --> 00:21:01,400
And those who do talk to me
don't want to go on the record.

402
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:03,765
In your previous stories,

403
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,767
how did you persuade women
to tell you

404
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,571
what had happened to them?

405
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:12,136
Yeah, so...

406
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,610
It's difficult.

407
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:16,140
They're terrified.

408
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,175
A case I made was,

409
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,421
"You know, I can't change what
happened to you in the past,

410
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:26,249
"but together we may be able
to use your experience

411
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:29,153
to help protect other people."

412
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:32,255
The truth, basically.

413
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,630
But yeah.

414
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:37,832
It's hard to ask women to talk.

00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:41,132

ASHLEY JUDD:
Then he asked me to meet him,

417
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,755
uh, really early.

418
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,352
And I had been up all night
filming, and I was tired.

419
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:06,795
I went over to The Peninsula
Hotel, and at reception,

420
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,325
I asked, "Is Mr. Weinstein
in The Belvedere restaurant

421
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,667
or is he on the patio?"

422
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:14,539
And they said, "Go to his room."

423
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:17,542
(over laptop):
And I went upstairs,

424
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:20,875
and Harvey was in his bathrobe.

425
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,274
And he asked if
he could give me a massage.

426
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,310
"No," I said.

427
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,147
And then, um, he asked me

428
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,281
to help him pick out
his clothes for the day.

429
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:35,725
He, you know, started asking
for all these things,

430
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,827
increasingly more sexual,
getting closer and closer.

431
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:41,962
And I just said no
so many different times

432
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:44,668
and in so many different ways.

433
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:49,332
And then he finally, um, asked
me to watch him take a shower.

434
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,170
And I said, "Harvey,

435
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:56,845
"when I win an Academy Award
in a Miramax movie,

436
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,748
I will give you a blow job."

437
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:01,278
And I got out of there fast.

438
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,752
What did you do?

439
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,315
I told my dad, I told my agent,

440
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,186
I told the people with whom
I was filming that night,

441
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,792
and Harvey punished me.

442
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:12,058
I mean, he blackballed my career

443
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:14,357
because I had the wherewithal
to refuse him.

444
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,831
How do you know that?

445
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:17,503
I would be standing
with other actresses,

446
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:18,768
and he would blank me.

447
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:20,902
There were roles
for which I was up

448
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:22,607
that I mysteriously did not get,

449
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:25,236
and I know today that it was
Harvey making a phone call.

450
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:29,438
You know I did an article about
it, and nobody did anything.

451
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:32,716
You didn't identify him,
but did industry people know

452
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,619
who you were talking about
in your article?

453
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:36,148
Absolutely.

454
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:39,316
And the abuse came raining down
on me, not on him.

455
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,592
You know at the Women's March

456
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,319
when I did
the "Nasty Woman" poem?

457
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,223
I lost a huge advertising gig
because a small group of people

458
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,226
complained that I was
quoting the president.

459
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,767
He used that language
and got elected.

460
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:53,572
I quoted him, and I got fired.

461
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,839
It is decades later,
and it's still the same sexism.

462
00:23:56,874 --> 00:24:00,337
And, Jodi, I would make
the same choices all over again,

463
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,779
but I also would like to work.

464
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,686
JODI:<i> Lisa Bloom, the lawyer,</i>
<i> she wrote to me.</i>

465
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:10,413

466
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,953
-Do you know her?
-No.

467
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:13,724
But I assume she wants to help.

468
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,451
I forwarded the email to Emily.

469
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:16,793

470
00:24:16,828 --> 00:24:18,157

I'm looking at it right now.

471
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,962
Yeah.
This is straight from legal.

472
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,263
EMILY:
Jodi? Lisa Bloom.

473
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,770

476
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:34,074
Weinstein is producing her book?

477

But why would she do that?

480
00:24:40,984 --> 00:24:42,951
How much do you get paid
for a miniseries?

481
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,822
He's got to be behind
Lisa reaching out to you.

482
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:48,627
So Weinstein knows
what we're doing.

-(traffic rumbling)

484
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:58,098

488
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:13,817
I worry about
whether it makes a difference.

489
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:15,852
These women spoke out
against Trump,

490
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,348
and he still became president.

491
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,955
But in the wake of O'Reilly,
there's possibility.

492
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,990

00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,675
Oh, s-- um...

499
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,303
Sorry. I, um...

500
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:42,274
Thank you
for the gift you, um...

501
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,211
Is anything bothering you?

502
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:47,851
Besides no sleep
and diapers everywhere.

503
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,448
Are you okay?

504
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,662
(softly):
I found it quite...

505
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:59,192
difficult.

506
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,897
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:02,668
Will working help?

508
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:05,363
Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,705
Absolutely.

510
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,333
It's better now.

512
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:18,508
MAN:
Megan.

513
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,114
(chuckles):
Hey.

514
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:36,262
MEGAN:
Are they all famous?

515
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:37,901
JODI:
Most of them, yes.

516
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:41,267
I guess my question
is just, like:

517
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,599
Is this the best use
of our time?

518
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:45,007
Like, as opposed to

519
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,845
other people we could
potentially be covering.

520
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,376
People who can't speak out.
Actresses already have a voice.

521
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,345
But they could also fear
being punished

522
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,446
by the film industry
for using it.

523
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,690
Sure.

524
00:26:57,725 --> 00:27:01,188
But what is it exactly
that we're looking at here?

525
00:27:01,223 --> 00:27:04,895
We're looking at extreme sexual
harassment in the workplace.

526
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,590
These young women walked into

527
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,768
what they all had reason to
believe were business meetings

528
00:27:09,803 --> 00:27:11,660
with a producer, an employer.

529
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,365
They were hopeful.

530
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,565
They were expecting a serious
conversation about their work

531
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,237
or a possible project.

532
00:27:17,272 --> 00:27:21,043
Instead, they say he met them
with threats and sexual demands.

533
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:23,606
They claim assault and rape.

534
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,982
If that can happen
to Hollywood actresses,

535
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:28,248
who else is it happening to?

536
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,482
Do you think his employees
were targeted, too?

537
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,957
I do.

538
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:40,656
I could search for any police
complaints against Miramax.

539
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:43,197
Or court records.

540
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,562
Should I?

541
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,268
Yes.

542
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:49,874
MEGAN:
I found records of a complaint

543
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:52,272
against Miramax from 2001,

544
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:55,605
but the report was closed out
the same day it was made.

545
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,278
It says, "complainant elected
court action,"

546
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:00,214
but then
no court documents exist,

547
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:01,919
which seems inconsistent.

548
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:04,823
Do you have
any more information on that?

549
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:06,088
WOMAN (over phone):
No, those records

550
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:08,486

Really? Why?

552
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:11,456
It's agency policy.

553
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:14,800
All records are destroyed
after three years.

554
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:16,626
Why is that?

555
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,970
As I said, it's policy.

556
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:22,302
So could you please tell me

557
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:25,338
who filed the
sexual harassment complaint?

558
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,945
No, I cannot.

559
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,541
-Because?
-It's policy.

560
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,885

It's about someone who's still
very powerful in the workplace.

564
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,159
Who could still be
harassing someone.

565
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:46,865
Is there any way
you can help me?

566
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:52,871
You could ask me the name
of the government investigator

567
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:54,807
who was assigned the case.

568
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:57,403
I could give you
that information.

569
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,537
-Just a name.
-Thank you.

MEGAN: I've made 20 calls
to track this investigator.

What did Lisa Bloom say?

572
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:12,649
JODI: She just talked as though
he was kind of naughty.

573
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,091
She was talking to me
kind of Jew-to-Jew

574
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:17,555
and including Weinstein
in the gang.

575

Oh.

576
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:23,726
I had a long conversation with
Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner.

577

or if there are fewer than
15 employees in the workplace.

831

Also, most lawyers
prefer settlements

832

'cause it's less of
a financial risk for them.

Don't let Weinstein talk to you,

I'd be interested in talking

No, if Harvey has
something to say,

855
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,841
he needs to say it publicly.

856
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,876

00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,311
It seemed to go away
very quickly.

875
00:46:18,346 --> 00:46:19,807
There was
no criminal conduct there.

876
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:24,053
The cops seemed
pretty confident there was.

877
00:46:24,088 --> 00:46:25,857
Do you think
there was anything irregular

878
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:26,891
about how it was handled?

879
00:46:26,926 --> 00:46:28,618
I don't.

880
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,059
Why would you say that?

881
00:46:30,094 --> 00:46:32,622
-(ringtone playing)
-(siren passing)

882
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:33,865
Gwyneth.

883
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,262
GWYNETH (over phone):
He's here.

884
00:46:35,297 --> 00:46:38,364
I invited a few people over,
and he turned up.

885
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:40,135
I haven't seen him for years.

886
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,368
He must know I spoke to you.

887
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,799
Why are you so certain
there was no criminal conduct?

888
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,339
Wasn't there a recording?

889
00:46:46,374 --> 00:46:47,736
Uh...

890
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,837
I don't think
there's a road to go down.

891
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:51,410
No.

892
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:54,215
Do you feel like you're in
physical danger at all?

893
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,646
GWYNETH: I'll keep people
around me till he goes.

894
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:58,582
It's a shock.
I know he's watching me.

895
00:46:58,617 --> 00:47:00,452
He's letting me know.

896
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,818
He can't do anything.

897
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:05,226
Gwyneth.

898
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:07,822
I'm here.
Call me if you need me.

899
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:09,395
Okay. Bye.

900
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,036
Linda, do you know Harvey?

901
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:14,763
I've met him socially,

902
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,403
but we've never been
to each other's homes.

903
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,174
Okay.

904
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:21,671
-I'm sure we'll speak soon.
-Yes.

905
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:24,047
Goodbye.

906
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:31,714
We got a good lead to talk
to a past executive at Miramax.

907
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,419
-Great. When will that be?
-MAN: Hey. Hola.

908
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,992
Jodi's talking to her tomorrow.

909
00:47:35,027 --> 00:47:36,191
MAN 2: Hey, I don't think
she heard you.

910
00:47:36,226 --> 00:47:37,390
She definitely didn't hear you.

911
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:40,228
-Oh, my God.
-What?

912
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:43,792
Ronan Farrow is working on

913
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,762
an H.W. piece
for<i> The New Yorker.</i>

914
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:47,972
What? Since when?

915
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:49,600
-Fuck.
-JODI: She doesn't say,

916
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:52,834
but apparently he's spoken
to a lot of actresses already.

917
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:53,868
WAITRESS:
Okay, ladies.

918
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:55,441
These are the menus.

919
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:56,981
-Thank you. -All right.
-REBECCA: Thank you.

920
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:58,906
It's pressure we can do without,

921
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:02,987
but we just keep going,
and we continue to be thorough.

922
00:48:03,022 --> 00:48:05,220
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Hello. Hi. Hello, everyone.

923
00:48:05,255 --> 00:48:07,123
Uh, did you, did you see
my friend over there?

924
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:08,322
He-he said hi.

925
00:48:08,357 --> 00:48:09,620
Could you leave us?

926
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:11,292
-We're talking.
-I absolutely will.

927
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:12,755
I totally understand,
but I was just thinking

928
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,394
maybe I could just have
a moment of your time.

929
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:15,296
All right, man.
We're having a conversation.

930
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:16,726
So, if you could just...

931
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:18,134
You should be doing
something else, though.

932
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:19,663
-Fuck you. (scoffs)
-Fuck you?

933
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:20,829
I would bend you over...

934
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,369
Fuck you!

935
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:24,833
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of here!

936
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,044
Fuck you, man! Get the fuck out!

937
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,838
(man laughs)

938
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,015
-Wow.
-Frigid bitches.

939
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,149
MAN:
Frigid bitches. (laughs)

940
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:34,612
MAN 2:
The guy's an asshole, right?

941
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:36,911
-MEGAN (whispers): Sorry.
-Don't apologize.

942
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:38,649
(scoffs)

943
00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:43,654
-(traffic rumbling)
-(footsteps running)

944
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:57,140
WOMAN: There was an incident
in Venice at the film festival.

945
00:48:57,175 --> 00:48:59,868
It was '98.

946
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,573
What happened?

947
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:05,148
(sighs softly)

948
00:49:05,183 --> 00:49:08,976
What makes me most angry
is the silence.

949
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:13,486
No one spoke out then, and
no one is talking about it now.

950
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:16,588
He built the silence,
and people complied.

951
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:19,558
He produced fear
and intimidation.

952
00:49:19,593 --> 00:49:21,626
The only alternative,
seemingly, was to quit

953
00:49:21,661 --> 00:49:24,596
and throw away everything
you worked so hard for

954
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:25,927
out the door.

955
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,962
You were terrified you were
gonna be the next target,

956
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,766
so people looked the other way.

957
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,044
-Within the company?
-Yes, and outside of it.

958
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:36,080
I mean, he played the press.
He played the agents.

959
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:37,708
How did he play the press?

960
00:49:37,743 --> 00:49:39,644
By promising them
access to stars

961
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,811
in exchange for
hushing up some incident.

962
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:43,714
What sort of incident?

963
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:46,816
(chuckles) Where do I start?

964
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:49,753
Harvey had this--
what did they call it?--

965
00:49:49,788 --> 00:49:55,396
"a physical altercation" with a
male employee at a conference.

966
00:49:55,431 --> 00:49:57,024
Then they settled with the guy.

967
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,268
And with women?

968
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,634
He pursued them.

969
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,399
Endlessly.

970
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:09,674
What happened in Venice?

971
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:13,579
I don't want to be quoted.

972
00:50:13,614 --> 00:50:14,382
Period.

973
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,549
Understood.

974
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:21,983
We were in Harvey's suite,

975
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,821
and (sniffles) there were
a bunch of people in there.

976
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,395
And there were
these two assistants,

977
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,266
and they were
sitting there trembling.

978
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:32,059
And Weinstein was there?

979
00:50:32,094 --> 00:50:34,204
Yes.

980
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,669
He was talking film
and ignoring them,

981
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:40,606
but they were
literally vibrating.

982
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:44,280
One with fear,
the other with anger.

983
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:48,284
Can you tell me their names?

984
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,319
Yes.

985
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:59,020
And there's another woman
you should, you should call.

986
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,562
The two assistants are
Rowena Chiu and Zelda Perkins,

987
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:05,697
and we have a third name,
Laura Madden.

988
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:08,436
And none of them
are returning our calls.

989
00:51:08,471 --> 00:51:10,339
So? Show up in person.

990
00:51:10,374 --> 00:51:12,737
Yeah. (chuckles)

991
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:17,104
They live in London,
Silicon Valley and Wales.

992
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:19,414
Can you get on a plane?

993
00:51:21,814 --> 00:51:23,946
(laughs)

994
00:51:26,258 --> 00:51:29,490
Let me work it out with Ron.

995
00:51:32,264 --> 00:51:35,265
But yeah, of course.

996
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,860
Documents, verification.

997
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:38,334
You know what we need.

999
00:52:02,228 --> 00:52:04,459

1001
00:52:16,407 --> 00:52:18,638
(dog barking in distance)

1002
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,105
JODI:
Hi.

1003
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,745
Sorry to bother you.
I can see you're busy.

1004
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,287
I was looking for Rowena Chiu.

1005
00:52:30,322 --> 00:52:31,816
Hi.

1006
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:35,116
Rowena's not here right now.
Can I give her a message?

1007
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,019
When will she be back?

1008
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:40,088
My wife's out of the country
for a while.

1009
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,397
(chuckles) I see.

1010
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:44,125
I did try calling her.

1011
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,533
This a work thing?

1012
00:52:45,568 --> 00:52:47,502
No. You must be Andrew?

1013
00:52:47,537 --> 00:52:48,998
Andrew Cheung?

1014
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:51,803
I'm Jodi Kantor.
I'm from<i> The New York Times.</i>

1015
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:53,508
Okay.

1016
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:57,413
So, what did you want
to talk to Rowena about?

1017
00:52:57,448 --> 00:53:00,581
We're researching a story
about Miramax.

1018
00:53:00,616 --> 00:53:03,485
I flew in from New York.

1019
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,850
-You came all this way?
-Yeah.

1020
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:07,258
(Andrew chuckles)

1021
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:09,887
Um, could we talk for a minute?

1022
00:53:09,922 --> 00:53:11,394
Sure.

1023
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:14,463
So, I've been speaking
with people

1024
00:53:14,498 --> 00:53:17,829
who worked for Harvey Weinstein.

1025
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:21,668
You're going quite far back
with Rowena's time there.

1026
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:23,703
We're writing about
his treatment of women.

1027
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,034
Right.

1028
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:28,169
And Rowena fits in how?

1029
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:32,382
Your wife worked at Miramax
for some years.

1030
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,615
Yes.

1031
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,946
Mainly in Hong Kong.

1032
00:53:35,981 --> 00:53:37,750
Like to hear about
her experiences

1033
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:39,290
working for Weinstein.

1034
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:42,458
I'm confused why you can't
discuss it on the phone.

1035
00:53:42,493 --> 00:53:44,955
(laughs) I did try.

1036
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,364
It is always better
to actually meet.

1037
00:53:49,258 --> 00:53:50,994
So...

1038
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:55,834
And this is off the record.

1039
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,935
My understanding is that...
(stammers)

1040
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,871
that Weinstein
possibly victimized your wife

1041
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:02,137
when Rowena
first worked for him.

1042
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:09,386
Rowena's never mentioned
anything like that to me.

1043
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,212
What-what do you mean
by "victimized"?

1044
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,719
Can you be more specific?

1045
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,623
I was told that your wife

1046
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:18,120
may have received a settlement
from Weinstein.

1047
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:22,399
(scoffs) Do I look like a guy
whose wife got a settlement?

1048
00:54:23,732 --> 00:54:26,128
Could you have confused her
with someone else?

1049
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:29,197
I-I... I apologize

give this to Rowena?

1052

If you're talking
to these other people,

1053
00:54:35,447 --> 00:54:36,809
why do you need
to talk to Rowena?

1054
00:54:36,844 --> 00:54:39,878
And if you turn up
in my driveway,

1055
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:41,616
what kind of victimization?

1056
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:43,354
It's complex.

1057
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,620
I'm asking you to expand on it.

1058

it would be best...

1059
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:52,495

he didn't know.

What if London is
a repeat of this?

1065
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,748
It won't be.

1066
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:16,981
I spoke with an
employment lawyer in the U.K.,

1067
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:20,589
and he told me that
it was irresponsible of me

1068
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:22,624
even to ask about
breaching NDAs.

1069
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:24,318
No one does it.
They would get sued.

1070
00:55:24,353 --> 00:55:25,891
Fuck that guy.

1071
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:29,224
Honestly, Jodi, fuck him.

-And how was it?
-It was great.

But it would shift
when Harvey came to town.

In what way?

1131
00:58:54,904 --> 00:58:58,741
Everyone became on call
to Harvey.

Script meetings, discussions
and more personal stuff.

1134
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,915
Like?

1135
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:10,511
For instance,
I would have to go to his hotel

1136
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:12,656
and wake Harvey up.

1137
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:14,383
Run his shower for him.

1138
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:15,824
Get him out of bed.

1139
00:59:15,859 --> 00:59:17,353
He would usually be naked.

1140
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,553
And he might try
to pull me onto him.

1141
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:21,291
What did you do?

1142
00:59:21,326 --> 00:59:22,831
I'd fend him off.

1143
00:59:22,866 --> 00:59:25,900
I found humor or aggression
worked best.

1144
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:29,772
Harvey was either
excited or furious.

1145
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,939
You never knew
which it would be.

1146

Did anyone on the team
give you advice about him?

Yes. (chuckles)

1148
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:40,244
Once, one girl told me to
always wear my puffer jacket,

1149
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:43,115
um, and to always sit
in an armchair,

1150
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:47,284
never the sofa next to him,
which helped.

1151
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:51,794

it wasn't only happening to me.

1152
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:53,829

And if they didn't?

1158
01:00:04,908 --> 01:00:06,369
Well, then he'd roar.

1159

"You need to come with me
right now."

1202
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:02,859

1203

1209
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:20,668

1210
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,241

and kids' lives

that I did not assault
that young woman."

card. Always.

1225
01:02:56,475 --> 01:02:58,640
But our lawyer said
we had no chance

1226
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:00,851
and the only thing to do
was to agree to a settlement.

1227
01:03:00,886 --> 01:03:02,215
And I said categorically no,

1228
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,953
that no money
should change hands

1229
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,383
and that we just wanted
to stop him.

1230
01:03:05,418 --> 01:03:08,023
And no U.K. police
were involved?

1231
01:03:08,058 --> 01:03:09,585
We had no case.

1232
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,785
We had no evidence and
no police report from Venice.

1233
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,292
And, you see, with rape,

1234
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:15,030
it is impossibly difficult
to get a prosecution.

1235
01:03:15,065 --> 01:03:16,559
And the lawyers kept saying

1236
01:03:16,594 --> 01:03:19,166
damage limitation
was the only way to go.

1237
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,399
So I said, "All right, then.

1238
01:03:21,434 --> 01:03:23,104
We have our own
very real demands."

1239
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:25,040
Conditions that Harvey
would have to meet

1240
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:26,206
if we were to sign.

1241
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,768
And what were those conditions?

1242
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:30,342
We demanded that if Harvey
had another settlement

1243
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,707
within two years, that it had
to be reported to Disney

1244
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:34,082
or else he would be fired.

1245
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:36,777
Another was that
he would go to therapy,

1246
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:38,152
with me present initially

1247
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:40,154
so that he couldn't lie
to the therapist.

1248
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:42,959
We demanded that
HR would put in a system

1249
01:03:42,994 --> 01:03:45,324
to protect the women and staff.

1250
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:48,195
And it felt like if we could
achieve all of those,

1251
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,197
then that's what our silence
was paying for,

1252
01:03:50,232 --> 01:03:53,266
that we were paying
for him to stop.

1253
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,500
So we signed.

1254
01:03:56,535 --> 01:03:59,635
And they had their own
insane conditions for us.

1255
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,307
What were they?

1256
01:04:02,211 --> 01:04:03,672
I tried to commit them
to memory.

1257
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:05,674
Um, they wouldn't give us
our own copy.

1258
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:07,313
What?

1259
01:04:07,348 --> 01:04:09,282
I was only given visitation
rights to my own settlement.

1260
01:04:09,317 --> 01:04:11,779
That's in... (stammers)

1261

But you memorized them?

1263
01:04:16,588 --> 01:04:22,262
I asked for letters, too, which
stated some of the conditions.

One said,

in a criminal or civil case."

We weren't allowed to talk
to our family or a doctor.

1267
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:39,081
So finally we signed.

1268
01:04:39,116 --> 01:04:41,908
They gave us some money.

1269

1398
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:18,810
I was going to be
working directly for him.

1399
01:11:18,845 --> 01:11:21,945
Doing errands, answering calls.

1400
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,915
I was very happy to be asked.

1401
01:11:26,688 --> 01:11:28,215
<i> He was charming.</i>

1402
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:32,087
<i> He was saying</i>
<i> he'd heard how hard I worked.</i>

1403
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:35,024
<i> And I was just excited.</i>

1404
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:40,293
<i> I was 21, you know,</i>
<i> very young but incredibly keen.</i>

1405
01:11:41,406 --> 01:11:43,835
<i> So when he said</i>
<i> he'd give me a permanent job</i>

1406
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:47,971
<i> at the London office,</i>
<i> I felt so happy.</i>

1407
01:11:48,006 --> 01:11:50,171
JODI:
<i> He said that in the meeting?</i>

1408
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:51,579
LAURA:
<i> Yes.</i>

1409
01:11:51,614 --> 01:11:54,879
He was in his bathrobe
when he opened the door,

1410
01:11:54,914 --> 01:11:59,620
but I thought
that was maybe very Hollywood.

1411
01:11:59,655 --> 01:12:02,392
But quite soon into talking,

1412
01:12:02,427 --> 01:12:05,087
he said,
would I give him a massage?

1413
01:12:07,432 --> 01:12:09,432
I-I said no.

1414
01:12:09,467 --> 01:12:10,763
He was very matter-of-fact.

1415
01:12:10,798 --> 01:12:13,194
He said it's not
a romantic request.

1416
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:15,603
Everyone does it for him.

1417
01:12:15,638 --> 01:12:17,704
It's part of the job.

1418
01:12:20,005 --> 01:12:25,008
So, I suddenly thought that
I was the problem, you know.

1419
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:28,715
That I was the one
who was sexualizing it.

1420
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:32,213
That I was just
young and uptight.

1421
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:33,819
So, I...

1422
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:36,888
...I put my hands
on his shoulders,

1423
01:12:36,923 --> 01:12:41,827
but I couldn't actually
move them at all over his body.

1424
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,291
I just stood there.

1425
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,161
My hands wouldn't move.

1426
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:51,573
And then he said he would
give me a massage first.

1427
01:12:51,608 --> 01:12:53,740
To relax me.

1428
01:12:55,975 --> 01:13:00,142
And he said,
"Look, all the girls do it.

1429
01:13:00,177 --> 01:13:02,650
It's just work."

1430
01:13:02,685 --> 01:13:05,455
And then he said,
"Take your top off."

1431
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:07,853
Very matter-of-fact.

1432
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:10,119
"Take your bra off."

1433
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,599
And I did.

1434
01:13:17,634 --> 01:13:21,735
I was terrified,
but I just thought,

1435
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,837
"Get through it. Do it."

1436
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,676
<i> And then my trousers were off,</i>

1437
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:32,812
<i> and he was standing over me...</i>

1438
01:13:32,847 --> 01:13:35,375
<i> masturbating.</i>

1439
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:39,082
<i> I asked him to leave me alone,</i>

1440
01:13:39,117 --> 01:13:42,217
<i> but he kept asking</i>
<i> for different things.</i>

1441
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:45,891
<i> And then he suggested a shower,</i>
<i> and I got up.</i>

1442
01:13:46,696 --> 01:13:50,225
<i> And he carried on...</i>

1443
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,359
<i> masturbating.</i>

1444
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,394
<i> And I kept crying.</i>

1445
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:57,397
<i> And I was sobbing,</i>
<i> and the water was pouring down,</i>

1446
01:13:57,432 --> 01:14:02,204
<i> and he was still masturbating.</i>

1447
01:14:03,009 --> 01:14:04,514
<i> Then he got angry.</i>

1448
01:14:04,549 --> 01:14:08,617
<i> I think my crying was so loud</i>
<i> it put him off.</i>

1449
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:13,754
<i> And he left the bathroom,</i>
<i> and I locked the door.</i>

1450
01:14:13,789 --> 01:14:15,316
(shower running)

1451
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:19,221
<i> And I could still hear him</i>
<i> on the other side.</i>

1452
01:14:19,256 --> 01:14:22,994
<i> Still the sounds</i>
<i> of him masturbating.</i>

1453
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:27,064
<i> Finally, I went back</i>
<i> into the room itself</i>

1454
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:31,035
<i> and grabbed my clothes</i>
<i> and belongings, and I just ran.</i>

1455
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,334
<i> I ran down the street.</i>

1456
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:37,613
<i> I've never run</i>
<i> that fast in my life.</i>

1457
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,918
How do you feel about it now?

1458
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:54,454
(sighs):
I...

1459
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,830
I... I feel like

1460
01:14:56,865 --> 01:15:01,164
it dictated a certain direction
my life took.

1461
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,970
That-- I just felt that it was
this huge e-error of judgment

1462
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:08,743
that sort of marked me
and all my decisions.

1463
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:11,240
And...

1464
01:15:12,914 --> 01:15:15,684
...I felt such shame...

1465
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:21,052
...that I let him do that.

1466
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:26,222
Did you think that he had done
the same to other girls?

1467
01:15:26,257 --> 01:15:28,862
I thought that
he must've tried it.

1468
01:15:30,668 --> 01:15:33,196
(voice breaking):
But that they'd all s...

1469
01:15:34,705 --> 01:15:36,936
...they'd all said no.

1470
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:44,141
It was like he t-took
my voice that day.

1471
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:51,148
Just when I was
about to start finding it.

1472
01:15:51,183 --> 01:15:52,853
(sniffles)

1473
01:15:53,955 --> 01:15:56,186
-(phones ringing)
-(busy TV and office chatter)

1474
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:00,586
DEAN:
Yes?

1475
01:16:00,621 --> 01:16:01,862
WOMAN (over phone):
I have Harvey Weinstein

1476
01:16:01,897 --> 01:16:03,930
on the phone for you.

1477
01:16:03,965 --> 01:16:06,196
DEAN:
Put him through. Thank you.

1478
01:16:08,134 --> 01:16:10,266
HARVEY: Dean, how are you?
This is Harvey.

1479
01:16:10,301 --> 01:16:13,005
Hi, Harvey.
What can I do for you?

1480
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,074
If I hadn't made movies,
I would've been a journalist.

1481
01:16:16,978 --> 01:16:19,682
Dean, I heard someone was
working on a story about me.

1482
01:16:19,717 --> 01:16:22,377
Yes. If you'd like to talk
to the reporters on the record,

1483
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,918
-they'd welcome that.
-I want to talk to you, Dean.

1484
01:16:24,953 --> 01:16:27,085
Well, talk to my reporters
about your concerns.

1485
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,384
I'm sorry. I have work to do.

1486
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:30,517
Are you gonna hang up?

1487
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:33,223
Unless you have
anything else to say.

1488
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:34,994
I love the truth.

1489
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:37,667
People make up stories a lot.

1490
01:16:37,702 --> 01:16:39,031
Be careful of that.

1491
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:41,297
That's fine, Harvey. Goodbye.

1492
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:44,839
♪ ♪

1493
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,216
-Hi, Chanel.
-Hey, Dean.

1494
01:16:59,251 --> 01:17:00,822
Hey, Tim.

1495
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:09,193
-Matt, you got a minute?
-Yeah.

1496
01:17:09,228 --> 01:17:10,799
DEAN:
<i> So, what do we have?</i>

1497
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:13,736
Well, the biggest thing is
the documents that Jodi got

1498
01:17:13,771 --> 01:17:15,232
from Zelda Perkins in London.

1499
01:17:15,267 --> 01:17:17,333
Rose is still off the record,

1500
01:17:17,368 --> 01:17:20,534
but she has given us permission
to write about her settlement.

1501
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,943
We're just trying to figure out
a way to confirm it.

1502
01:17:22,978 --> 01:17:25,011
Harvey offered her
a million dollars recently

1503
01:17:25,046 --> 01:17:27,607
for her silence.

1504
01:17:27,642 --> 01:17:29,279
-And?
-Rose refused,

1505
01:17:29,314 --> 01:17:30,951
but she doesn't want us
to quote her.

1506
01:17:30,986 --> 01:17:32,678
There are still
no on-the-record sources.

1507
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:33,987
NDAs are a problem.

1508
01:17:34,022 --> 01:17:36,286
MEGAN:
Laura Madden didn't sign one.

1509
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:39,124
She's the only ex-assistant who
is technically free to speak.

1510
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:40,994
Ashley and Gwyneth
didn't sign one either,

1511
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:42,391
but they're not ready
to go on the record.

1512
01:17:42,426 --> 01:17:44,393
But Laura Madden
has to deal with something

1513
01:17:44,428 --> 01:17:46,736
-very different right now.
-She has breast cancer.

1514
01:17:46,771 --> 01:17:49,904
She has to go into surgery,
so it's not likely.

1515
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:51,807
I'm still leaving messages
for Rowena Chiu,

1516
01:17:51,842 --> 01:17:54,106
but there's no engagement.

1517
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:55,536
So, no more proven settlements.

1518
01:17:55,571 --> 01:17:58,440
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez
almost certainly settled.

1519
01:17:58,475 --> 01:18:00,849
And John Schmidt confirmed
that Miramax settled

1520
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:02,411
with the woman
I visited in Queens.

1521
01:18:02,446 --> 01:18:04,479
Anything more on the article
from<i> The New Yorker?</i>

1522
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:05,788
No.

1523
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,715
Lanny Davis and David Boies
want to come talk to us.

1524
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,255
What do you think?

1525
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,257
Don't we want to wait
and push for

1526
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:15,160
an on-the-record interview
with Weinstein?

1527
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:16,326
It's your call, Binky.

1528
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:19,164
I'd like to talk to Lanny
at least.

1529
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,803
See what he has to say.

1530
01:18:20,838 --> 01:18:22,662
LANNY:<i> Harvey's not</i>
<i> always that rational.</i>

1531
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:24,873
<i> The reason I'm here</i>
<i> as his representative</i>

1532
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,534
<i> is not to try to kill anything.</i>

1533
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,734
<i> I want to know that</i>
<i> if you're including something</i>

1534
01:18:28,769 --> 01:18:31,946
<i> like Rósa McGowan's claim,</i>
<i> then we can defend that.</i>

1535
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:33,409
REBECCA:
<i> Of course.</i>

1536
01:18:33,444 --> 01:18:35,147
Please.

1537
01:18:38,515 --> 01:18:42,517
I know you'll be investigating
with due diligence.

1538
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:43,584
-Lanny...
-Mm-hmm?

1539
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:45,454
...you'll have
every chance to respond.

1540
01:18:45,489 --> 01:18:47,489
Oh. Uh...

1541
01:18:47,524 --> 01:18:49,557
And I trust
it's okay to record this?

1542
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,757
Oh, of course. Sure.

1543
01:18:51,792 --> 01:18:55,464
I don't expect you to name
sources, but if it's possible

1544
01:18:55,499 --> 01:18:58,940
for you to let me know overall
what your story's about?

1545
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:01,305
We're looking into
problematic behavior

1546
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,406
towards women by Weinstein.

1547
01:19:04,211 --> 01:19:06,673
Okay. (inhales deeply)

1548
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,677
Harvey adamantly denies any
allegation of rape or assault.

1549
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,382
Nothing criminal.

1550
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:16,650
But he is aware of complaints
about his treatment of women,

1551
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,158
and he is working on that.

1552
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:23,162
Powerful men
of an older generation

1553
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,592
are changing their understanding

1554
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,561
of the meaning of the word
"consensual."

1555
01:19:26,596 --> 01:19:28,530
Why women don't feel
it's consensual

1556
01:19:28,565 --> 01:19:31,401
even if a man
convinces himself it is.

1557
01:19:31,436 --> 01:19:34,008
Do you want to expand on that?

1558
01:19:34,043 --> 01:19:36,604
Uh, I believe (chuckles)

1559
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:39,706
there's a story to be told
about the evolution of men.

1560
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:42,313
And, in particular, Harvey
on this subject.

1561
01:19:42,348 --> 01:19:45,085
Uh, would he be willing
to talk to us about it?

1562
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,351
On the record.

1563
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,816
He has to deal with
his wife and children

1564
01:19:50,851 --> 01:19:52,125
before anything else.

1565
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:58,395
You're adamant Rose McGowan's
rape accusation is false.

1566
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:00,199
Why is that?

1567
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:01,937
Did she tell anybody right away?

1568
01:20:01,972 --> 01:20:03,400
Did she show
any signs of distress?

1569
01:20:03,435 --> 01:20:06,370
She told her manager
and a lawyer.

1570
01:20:08,407 --> 01:20:11,144
Harvey was aware that
there was a problem with Rose,

1571
01:20:11,179 --> 01:20:13,608
but not that
she was accusing him of rape.

1572
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:16,182
So I draw a bright line
on the word "rape."

1573
01:20:16,217 --> 01:20:18,580
Anything below that line,

1574
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:21,715
uh, he was aware of
feelings, concerns.

1575
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,156
Of what kind?

1576
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:24,454
I'm sorry. What...

1577
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:26,786
If the concerns
were not about rape,

1578
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:28,656
what were they about?

1579
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:33,463
The only way I can answer
is, um...

1580
01:20:34,939 --> 01:20:36,466
...a sense of exploitation

1581
01:20:36,501 --> 01:20:40,800
because of that
disparate power relationship.

1582
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:44,804
There's mental coercion
that isn't physical coercion.

1583
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:47,345
Lisa Bloom has been
working with Harvey

1584
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,050
to help him
recognize the difference.

1585
01:20:49,085 --> 01:20:50,414
Lisa Bloom?

1586
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:52,251
Yeah.

1587
01:20:52,286 --> 01:20:54,814
MEGAN:
If Harvey had been made aware

1588
01:20:54,849 --> 01:21:00,061
of McGowan's concerns
at the time, how did he respond?

1589
01:21:01,295 --> 01:21:03,592
I think he had dealings legally
with her about them.

1590
01:21:03,627 --> 01:21:08,135
And how would you characterize
those legal dealings?

1591
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,402
I think he became aware that

1592
01:21:11,437 --> 01:21:14,141
she did not regard
what happened as okay with her.

1593
01:21:14,176 --> 01:21:15,703
I'm not talking about rape.

1594
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:19,949
I'm talking about the effect
he had on Rose McGowan.

1595
01:21:19,984 --> 01:21:22,512
And that rather than fighting...

1596
01:21:23,317 --> 01:21:24,954
"Rather than fighting"?

1597
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:28,188
Then... then what?

1598
01:21:30,555 --> 01:21:33,721
I-I think he has agreed
to settlements

1599
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:36,394
rather than litigating
what might have been litigated.

1600
01:21:36,429 --> 01:21:39,463
As Harvey saw it,
it was better to settle,

1601
01:21:39,498 --> 01:21:41,267
even if you haven't done
anything wrong.

1602
01:21:41,302 --> 01:21:43,533
He preferred to settle.

1603
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:48,604
Were there other cases of
questionable intimate relations

1604
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:51,244
with women
in which Weinstein settled?

1605
01:21:53,512 --> 01:21:57,052
Let's say for now,
even on a background basis,

1606
01:21:57,087 --> 01:21:59,681
that I need to find out
what my limits are legally.

1607
01:21:59,716 --> 01:22:03,586
Even if on background,
I'm confirming settlements.

1608
01:22:03,621 --> 01:22:08,228
But the-the answer is yes,
there have been.

1609
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,068
How many?

1610
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:16,302
(softly):
No.

1611
01:22:17,074 --> 01:22:18,832
(Lanny chuckles)

1612
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:22,374
To admit to settlements this
early, they're in real trouble.

1613
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:24,178
-We need to find out a number.
-(Megan chuckles)

1614
01:22:24,213 --> 01:22:25,641
We need to corroborate each one.

1615
01:22:25,676 --> 01:22:27,643
-I'm on it.
-(phone vibrating)

1616
01:22:27,678 --> 01:22:31,581
Have you guys had any dealings
with Diana Filip?

1617
01:22:31,616 --> 01:22:33,715
-No. -I said no to speaking
at a women's conference.

1618
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,751
-She just keeps on calling me.
-Did you have her checked out?

1619
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:38,522
Security consultant says
she's legit,

1620
01:22:38,557 --> 01:22:40,689
but who has time
for these random people?

1621
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,133
(phone vibrating)

1622
01:22:54,034 --> 01:22:55,374
Hello?

1623
01:22:55,409 --> 01:22:56,771
WOMAN (over phone):
I worked at Miramax.

1624
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:59,048
Talk to Irwin Reiter.
He hates Weinstein.

1625
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:00,478
(line clicks)

1626
01:23:05,122 --> 01:23:07,353
(phone vibrating)

1627
01:23:10,457 --> 01:23:12,259
Hey. Are you okay?

1628
01:23:12,294 --> 01:23:15,064
JODI (over phone):
Did I wake you?

1629
01:23:15,099 --> 01:23:17,627
Um, yeah. What's up?

1630
01:23:17,662 --> 01:23:20,894
JODI: What do you know
about Irwin Reiter?

1631
01:23:22,172 --> 01:23:25,305
Hang on.
I put together a file on him.

1632
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:28,539
I need to write
a good fucking email.

1633
01:23:40,421 --> 01:23:43,158
Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

1634
01:23:43,193 --> 01:23:44,918
You want to get me killed?

1635
01:23:52,136 --> 01:23:56,765
So, Irwin, you've been an
accountant for the Weinsteins

1636
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,503
for 30 years.

1637
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:01,374
(pours drink)

1638
01:24:01,409 --> 01:24:02,936
I pick up the check,

1639
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,872
and I reserve the right
to leave after five minutes.

1640
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:06,038
(clears throat)

1641
01:24:06,073 --> 01:24:09,415
So, um...
what do you want to know?

1642
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,681
We have information
on several settlements

1643
01:24:11,716 --> 01:24:13,485
that Weinstein made in the '90s,

1644
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,290
paid to actresses
and ex-employees.

1645
01:24:16,325 --> 01:24:19,557
Could you tell me anything
about that?

1646
01:24:21,627 --> 01:24:23,825
Could you confirm
those settlements

1647
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,431
and how it was
from your perspective?

1648
01:24:25,466 --> 01:24:27,532
My perspective?

1649
01:24:28,568 --> 01:24:30,931
Would it be company money
that was used?

1650
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:35,903
You wrote that we're from
the same tiny world.

1651
01:24:35,938 --> 01:24:37,245
Yeah.

1652
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,313
Summers at bungalows
in the Catskills.

1653
01:24:39,348 --> 01:24:41,942
Meals at Lefty's and Pop-Ins.

1654
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:44,945
What do you remember
about those holidays?

1655
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:48,256
Gosh, I remember so many things.

1656
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,983
It's the first time
I remember seeing

1657
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,084
my grandmother's arms bare.

1658
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:56,924
I knew those tattoos meant
something seismic.

1659
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:58,794
Yeah, h-how did you know?

1660
01:24:58,829 --> 01:25:00,169
I just sensed it.

1661
01:25:00,204 --> 01:25:03,238
Did your family discuss it?

1662
01:25:06,408 --> 01:25:09,178
Who else are you talking to?

1663
01:25:09,213 --> 01:25:11,510
I can't disclose that, Irwin.

1664
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,977
You know, my parents,
uh, they couldn't go there.

1665
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:19,386
They rarely discussed it.

1666
01:25:20,653 --> 01:25:22,752
It's so mysterious, isn't it?

1667
01:25:23,557 --> 01:25:25,920
Why some families talk.

1668
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:27,559
Some don't.

1669
01:25:29,156 --> 01:25:34,159
The money Weinstein was
spending was, you know, crazy.

1670
01:25:34,194 --> 01:25:35,204
I tried.

1671
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:36,898
I tried many times to

1672
01:25:36,933 --> 01:25:39,868
get the board to do something
about him, but they just kept

1673
01:25:39,903 --> 01:25:42,376
ignoring his behavior
and keeping him on.

1674
01:25:42,411 --> 01:25:44,543
Why is that?

1675
01:25:45,447 --> 01:25:48,349
Have you talked to L.O.C.?

1676
01:25:48,384 --> 01:25:50,813
Or, uh, Z.P.?

1677
01:25:50,848 --> 01:25:53,079
Who is L.O.C.?

1678
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:55,257
There was this memo.

1679
01:25:55,292 --> 01:25:58,359
Let me ask you something, Jodi,
that's really puzzling me.

1680
01:25:58,394 --> 01:26:01,087
Why are you asking
about the '90s

1681
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:04,860
when Weinstein has committed
so many more recent offenses?

1682
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,633
I got to go.

1683
01:26:08,668 --> 01:26:10,932
-I'll give you a call.
-Irwin.

1684
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:17,312
♪ ♪

1685
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:38,432
(breathes deeply)

1686
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:44,031
(door opens)

1687
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:46,033
(crying):
Mom.

1688
01:26:46,068 --> 01:26:47,672
I had a nightmare.

1689
01:26:47,707 --> 01:26:50,807
-Oh, honey, come here.
-(sobs)

1690
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:56,417
-(crying softly)
-(shushing)

1691
01:26:56,452 --> 01:26:58,683
(whispering):
It's okay. It's okay.

1692
01:26:58,718 --> 01:27:00,487
I heard that
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez

1693
01:27:00,522 --> 01:27:02,654
just got
a seven-figure settlement.

1694
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:06,625
And that Weinstein now owns
the audio of the incident?

1695
01:27:07,892 --> 01:27:11,058
These settlements, Lanny...

1696
01:27:11,093 --> 01:27:12,565
what are we talking?

1697
01:27:13,799 --> 01:27:16,096
I can't tell you that, Megan.

1698
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:17,537
You know that.

1699
01:27:17,572 --> 01:27:19,099
I'm not talking about
naming you, of course.

1700
01:27:19,134 --> 01:27:22,905
It would just be great
for background

1701
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,170
to know a number

1702
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,074
of the other settlements
that you're aware of.

1703
01:27:27,879 --> 01:27:30,242
-I'm not a bad guy here.
-I know that.

1704
01:27:30,277 --> 01:27:32,651
My profession is
to get the facts

1705
01:27:32,686 --> 01:27:35,489
into the hands
of reporters, but...

1706
01:27:35,524 --> 01:27:38,393
(laughs):
you know, I can't help.

1707
01:27:40,892 --> 01:27:43,860
I keep getting 40 in my head.

1708
01:27:43,895 --> 01:27:44,960
(sighs)

1709
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:47,732
Which would be
ridiculous, right?

1710
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:51,967
Right?

1711
01:27:52,002 --> 01:27:53,573
(smacks lips)

1712
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:56,477
It's not 40.

1713
01:27:58,778 --> 01:28:02,582
Seriously, it's-it's,
uh, less than 40.

1714
01:28:02,617 --> 01:28:04,584
Good. That's a relief.

1715
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:06,179
-(scoffs): Sure.
-(laughs)

1716
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:10,117
So...

1717
01:28:10,922 --> 01:28:14,924
...less than half of 40, then?

1718
01:28:14,959 --> 01:28:15,859
Check.

1719
01:28:15,894 --> 01:28:17,366
Oh, and what the fuck, Lanny?

1720
01:28:17,401 --> 01:28:19,962
We heard that Ronan Farrow
is working on a story.

1721
01:28:19,997 --> 01:28:21,029
No, no.

1722
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:23,867
That is done. Over.

1723
01:28:25,475 --> 01:28:28,036
I don't see you
as a bad guy, Lanny.

1724
01:28:28,841 --> 01:28:31,413
I-I don't. I never have.
I respect you.

1725
01:28:31,448 --> 01:28:33,041
Uh, I respect you.

1726
01:28:35,881 --> 01:28:37,947
(sighs)

1727
01:28:37,982 --> 01:28:41,181
This is all
gonna come out, Lanny.

1728
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,183
Publicly.

1729
01:28:43,218 --> 01:28:44,558
Generally does.

1730
01:28:44,593 --> 01:28:46,659
(chuckles)

1731
01:28:46,694 --> 01:28:48,826
-(laughs): Okay.
-(laughing)

1732
01:28:50,632 --> 01:28:53,435
Wh... What am I laughing about?

1733
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:55,327
(both laugh)

1734
01:28:55,362 --> 01:28:58,671
(sighs):
Oh, Megan.

1735
01:28:59,608 --> 01:29:01,003
Lanny.

1736
01:29:09,651 --> 01:29:11,882
I'd say eight to 12 settlements.

1737
01:29:17,461 --> 01:29:19,494
(sighs softly)

1738
01:29:24,765 --> 01:29:27,667

1739

1740
01:29:35,138 --> 01:29:37,908

1753
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,814

1755

not just in me but in...

1756
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:30,796
but in all w-women I talked to,
if it just...

1757
01:30:30,831 --> 01:30:33,062
this darkness,
this constant violence,

1758
01:30:33,097 --> 01:30:35,801

1759

(smacks lips)

1766

It was, uh,
from an ex-executive,

1767
01:31:18,648 --> 01:31:20,439
and it was extensive, scathing.

1768
01:31:20,474 --> 01:31:21,979
She sent it to the board.

1772

1773
01:31:30,924 --> 01:31:33,221
That the company was
a toxic environment.

1782

1783
01:32:03,858 --> 01:32:07,486
There's already

heading towards Florida.

1786

1800
01:32:44,932 --> 01:32:46,734
I'm in New York.

1801
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:48,901
Do you still want to meet up?

1802
01:32:49,739 --> 01:32:51,838
ROWENA:
I couldn't tell anyone.

1803
01:32:51,873 --> 01:32:55,204
Not my parents,
not even my husband.

1804
01:32:55,239 --> 01:32:56,975
Why not?

1805
01:32:58,077 --> 01:33:00,407
I grew up
in an immigrant household.

1806
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:03,146
I was taught
to keep my head down,

1807
01:33:03,181 --> 01:33:07,018
work hard and not draw
attention to myself, you know?

1808
01:33:07,053 --> 01:33:08,514
In Chinese culture,

1809
01:33:08,549 --> 01:33:12,452
I felt I had to protect
my family at all costs.

1810
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:15,994
And I was young, scared.

1811
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:21,802
Can you tell me anything about
what happened in Venice?

1812
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:27,005
This is off the record, yeah?

1813
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:32,208
I had the evening shifts,

1814
01:33:32,243 --> 01:33:35,343
going through notes
on screenplays with Harvey.

1815
01:33:35,378 --> 01:33:41,217
One night, we were working,
and he kept trying to touch me.

1816
01:33:41,252 --> 01:33:43,417
I didn't want to make him angry.

1817
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:46,860
He's a very big man.

1818
01:33:46,895 --> 01:33:49,159
I kept trying
to get back to the notes.

1819
01:33:49,194 --> 01:33:52,492
And that went on
for a few hours,

1820
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:54,461
just trying to avoid him.

1821
01:33:54,496 --> 01:33:56,529
How did you do that?

1822
01:33:57,741 --> 01:34:00,533
I would just fight him off.

1823
01:34:01,701 --> 01:34:03,503
I'd worn two pairs of tights

1824
01:34:03,538 --> 01:34:07,672
to buy me some time
if I ever needed it.

1825
01:34:07,707 --> 01:34:10,510
But finally,

1826
01:34:10,545 --> 01:34:13,854
he held me down.

1827
01:34:13,889 --> 01:34:17,858
Not forcefully,
but like it was a game.

1828
01:34:17,893 --> 01:34:19,024
(stammers softly)

1829
01:34:19,059 --> 01:34:23,391
Then he parted my legs,

1830
01:34:23,426 --> 01:34:25,327
and he said...

1831
01:34:26,462 --> 01:34:30,871
"Please, just one thrust,
and it'll all be over."

1832
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:36,041
I got away.

1833
01:34:36,076 --> 01:34:38,010
I was traumatized.

1834
01:34:38,045 --> 01:34:39,308
I was a Christian.

1835
01:34:39,343 --> 01:34:42,113
I was still
with my first boyfriend.

1836
01:34:42,148 --> 01:34:44,610
And you shared this with Zelda?

1837
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:50,055
Zelda was completely enraged
and very brave in facing him.

1838
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:51,584
We both resigned.

1839
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:53,553
(inhales deeply)

1840
01:34:53,588 --> 01:34:56,721
But I couldn't get a new job
after leaving Miramax. (sighs)

1841
01:34:56,756 --> 01:34:58,899
Everyone kept saying,
if I worked for Harvey,

1842
01:34:58,934 --> 01:35:00,263
why would I leave?

1843
01:35:01,695 --> 01:35:04,300
The NDA that we signed,

1844
01:35:04,335 --> 01:35:06,665
it stipulated that
if I ever had trouble

1845
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:10,570
getting a job in film again,
I was to go back to Harvey

1846
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:12,979
or his lawyer Hutensky for help.

1847
01:35:13,773 --> 01:35:16,983
I asked them for a reference,

1848
01:35:17,018 --> 01:35:21,317
and Hutensky,
he kept repeating...

(sighs)

1850
01:35:23,519 --> 01:35:25,618

1920

-Yeah. -DEAN: Get ahold of
the Weinstein Company board

1922

1923
01:40:39,406 --> 01:40:40,999
Let me call Lance Maerov.

1924
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,243
Write it. Let's get ready.

NICOLE:<i> My client does not</i>
<i> want to be named.</i>

NICOLE:

1929
01:40:54,421 --> 01:40:56,355
<i> but she's too upset to speak.</i>

1930
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:58,159
REBECCA:
<i> Lauren, I'm sorry</i>

1931
01:40:58,194 --> 01:40:59,523
this is difficult for you.

1932
01:40:59,558 --> 01:41:01,426
We're not gonna publish
the whole memo.

1933
01:41:01,461 --> 01:41:03,659
And we will make it
absolutely clear

1934
01:41:03,694 --> 01:41:06,992
you were not the source and
that you declined to comment.

1935
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:10,402
But we do intend to use
your name for its credibility.

1936
01:41:10,437 --> 01:41:12,635
If you were
a victim of sexual assault,

1937
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,473
we would absolutely keep
your anonymity.

1938
01:41:15,508 --> 01:41:17,475
But as a witness
to what went on,

1939
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:20,841
it would make this story
much stronger to name you.

1940
01:41:20,876 --> 01:41:23,811
Hi, Lance. This is Megan Twohey
from<i> The New York Times.</i>

1941
01:41:23,846 --> 01:41:25,945
We have a memo here
from Lauren O'Connor

1942
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:27,254
to The Weinstein Company.

1943
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:28,717
-What? Sh...
-MEGAN: We want to know,

1944
01:41:28,752 --> 01:41:30,290
-what did you do about it?
-Shit.

1945
01:41:30,325 --> 01:41:32,787
What did the board do about it?

1946
01:41:33,592 --> 01:41:35,922
(breathing heavily)

1947
01:41:37,728 --> 01:41:39,464
Lance?

1948
01:41:39,499 --> 01:41:40,696
We did try to change things

1949
01:41:40,731 --> 01:41:43,094
with the police complaint
in 2015.

1950
01:41:43,129 --> 01:41:44,370
What about this memo?

1951
01:41:44,405 --> 01:41:45,767
It was there
and then it was gone?

1952
01:41:45,802 --> 01:41:49,375
Look, we were all worried
about Harvey's behavior.

1953
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:51,542
Can I quote you, Lance?

1954
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:57,548
Yes. Yes, you can.

1955
01:41:57,583 --> 01:42:00,287
So, Lauren's complaint?

1956
01:42:02,984 --> 01:42:06,557
It was withdrawn
days after it was sent.

1957
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,855
So, yeah, I let it go.

1958
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:10,594
Well, why do you think
it was withdrawn?

1959
01:42:10,629 --> 01:42:13,124
I really don't know why.

1960
01:42:13,159 --> 01:42:16,127
Look, are you sure that
this isn't just young women

1961
01:42:16,162 --> 01:42:20,439
who want to sleep with a movie
producer to try to get ahead?

1962
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:22,639
We have decades of allegations,

1963
01:42:22,674 --> 01:42:26,104
accusations of
harassment, assault,

1964
01:42:26,139 --> 01:42:28,678
rape and multiple settlements.

1965
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,946
I know you're gonna need
to speak to the board,

1966
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:35,949
but could you wait
until after the weekend?

1967
01:42:35,984 --> 01:42:38,292
Is that possible?

1968
01:42:38,327 --> 01:42:39,821
(clears throat)

1969
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:42,593
Okay.

1970
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:54,000
Ashley, I know that
ideally a lot of women

1971
01:42:54,035 --> 01:42:58,312
would be jumping together,
but that's not what's happening.

1972
01:42:58,347 --> 01:43:00,908
But we do have
a series of incidents

1973
01:43:00,943 --> 01:43:02,811
and a predatory pattern.

1974
01:43:02,846 --> 01:43:04,747
You would be
coming forward alone,

1975
01:43:04,782 --> 01:43:08,080
but you would be standing
on a mountain of evidence.

1976
01:43:11,492 --> 01:43:13,052
Ashley?

1977
01:43:13,087 --> 01:43:17,056
ASHLEY: Yes. I'll think
about it very seriously, Jodi.

1978
01:43:17,091 --> 01:43:18,365
I promise.

1979
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,224

I know we need to be mindful
of<i> The New Yorker,</i>

1983
01:43:28,102 --> 01:43:29,904
but couldn't we wait
just a little longer,

1984
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:31,741
just-just for these women
to commit?

1985
01:43:31,776 --> 01:43:33,545
No. We need to publish.

1986
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,074
It's nothing like
the whole story.

1987

This can be the first arrow.

1988

More women will come forward
afterwards.

1989
01:43:38,684 --> 01:43:41,586
It could be
so much stronger, Dean.

1990
01:43:41,621 --> 01:43:44,017
It's solid.

1991
01:43:44,052 --> 01:43:45,590
We need to go.

1992

Weinstein to respond?

-24 hours?
-I'd double it.

1994
01:43:51,499 --> 01:43:52,795
48 hours.

1995
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:54,863
-That's fair.
-DEAN: Two days?

How many people could
Harvey and his team talk to

1997
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:59,065

David?

1999

We'll ask to speak to Harvey
