1
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:23,332
This is fucking bullshit.

2
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,433
All right.
Let's fucking do this.

3
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:15,055
We're gonna be
fucking downstairs,

4
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,391
you don't fucking stop.

5
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,203
Fucking assholes!

6
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,617
Hey, should we turn this off?

7
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,441
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Fuck you.

8
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:39,413
You fucking little goddamn
slippery midget.

9
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:14,985
Little midget.
Little tiny people.

10
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:24,095
Special delivery, Tattoo.

11
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:34,706
Well, then fuck you.
Fuck you, motherfucker.

12
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:37,542
Abuelita!

13
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:59,731
Lord.

14
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,451
They're getting in.
I'm out of here.

15
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,522
It's Geronimo time.

16
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,662
Aah! Don't touch the dick.

17
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:34,835
Get your ass back
here, Geronimo. Come on.

18
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:39,439
We can fucking hold him off.
Get your ass back over here.

19
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:04,466
Die!

20
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:08,238
Bleed!

21
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:10,541
Die!

22
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,342
Bleed!

23
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:16,712
Bleed it all out,
fucking bastard.

24
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:19,317
Bleed it all out!

25
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:35,601
That's some Pam Grier-type shit.

26
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:51,317
Any of you limp dicks
wanna pitch in...

27
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,352
...be my guest.

28
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:54,820
Thanks for the pep talk, Hoss.

29
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:57,257
I'm out of here.

30
00:06:57,258 --> 00:07:00,828
Fucking rally the troops.

31
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,443
Wait, wait. Wait!

32
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,380
Fuck.

33
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,986
Ow. Ow.

34
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:54,786
I know a lot of you don't believe what
I believe. But you gotta believe.

35
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,787
We need to ask for help.

36
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:58,422
We gotta believe it's coming.

37
00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:03,061
I don't know how, what shape,
what size, where,

38
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:05,630
but we gotta believe.

39
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,637
When we believe,
we will receive.

40
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:14,474
If we don't believe...

41
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:17,678
...we're already dead.

42
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,750
Join with me, people.

43
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,337
Fuck.

44
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,063
Join with me.

45
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,666
Shut up.

46
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,468
Join with me.

47
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,836
I'm sick and tired of that shit.

48
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:14,003
Stop it.

49
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,372
Just fucking stop it.

50
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:16,741
Stop it!

51
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:19,777
Secrets, we're being
fucking exterminated.

52
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:23,147
No amount of hoping,
begging or praying

53
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:24,983
is gonna fucking fix it.

54
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:26,884
No fucking bullshit

55
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:30,456
book-of-the-month
is gonna save us.

56
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:33,091
We're on the fucking
chopping block here.

57
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:36,429
It's fucking Armageddon outside.

58
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:39,465
So wake the fuck up,
you little floozy.

59
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,504
And all we got is jack and shit.

60
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:47,940
We're what's left
of what's left behind.

61
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:53,080
And nobody's fucking
coming to save us.

62
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:16,071
Oh, fuck.

63
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:24,147
Shit, what the fuck is that?

64
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,049
Israel.

65
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,818
I told you all.

66
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:31,822
Move your asses, dipshits.

67
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:54,011
If you ain't living on the edge,

68
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:56,614
you're taking up too much space.

69
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,018
Shh.

70
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:07,060
Come on.
Come on. Go, go.

71
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:39,060
Come on. Get in.

72
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:42,164
What the fuck?

73
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,639
Fuck off.

74
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,687
Hold it right there.

75
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,689
Who are you people?

76
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,257
We're just people

77
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:11,028
trying to save our asses,
hotshot.

78
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:11,763
OK?

79
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,667
Been waiting
all night for the cavalry.

80
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,237
- You it?
- No.

81
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,672
They're all dead.

82
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,943
Ain't nobody else coming here?

83
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,246
I've been driving all night.

84
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,082
There's no army, no militia,

85
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:35,822
no soldiers and only bits and
pieces of Boy Scouts left.

86
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,824
Ain't no one
of substance coming.

87
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,261
What the heck happened to him?

88
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,029
He was fucking stupid,
that's what happened.

89
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,034
There are weapons here.
This ain't a place to stay.

90
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:51,104
I'm mounting an offensive.

91
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,673
Who's game?

92
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:55,110
Look out!

93
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:02,149
Remember me, motherfucker, huh?

94
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:18,668
Oh, shit.

95
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,671
Y'all literally
kicked the shit out of him.

96
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:23,940
He's a piece of shit.

97
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:28,745
He's been holed up in here,
wouldn't let anyone in.

98
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,881
Just watched them die.

99
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:34,019
They didn't say the magic word.

100
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:38,656
Where's your nephew, huh?

101
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:40,157
I haven't seen him
since the invasion.

102
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:43,094
He is out there, where the fuck is he?

103
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:45,196
- Where is he?
- I ain't seen him.

104
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:47,432
- I ain't seen him. I swear.
- Asshole!

105
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:52,704
I swear, I ain't seen him.
I swear. -

106
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,980
What's all this offensive shit,
partner?

107
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:03,849
I'm taking the fight to them.

108
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,388
I heard all that shit in the war
and I gotta tell you, cowboy,

109
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,457
it never turned out well.

110
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:15,962
I'm talking about a good old-fashioned
street fight, old-timer.

111
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:20,936
They'll keep coming till we figure
out how to stomp them down.

112
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:30,978
Hell, we're not safe out here.

113
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:34,717
Let's get back to the cell.

114
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,720
Come on.

115
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,477
How are you gonna do that?

116
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,746
Stomp them out.

117
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:06,151
Well, with sweat,
firepower and...

118
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:10,455
...and a little something
called courage.

119
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:13,325
You people wanna
wait here and die?

120
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:16,261
Or you wanna take the fight
to these devil dogs?

121
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:18,864
Yeah.

122
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah, we should fight,
shouldn't we?

123
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:26,072
As soon as we find
the keys for that gun cabinet,

124
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:28,174
grab some guns,

125
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,475
throw your chambers
in your pockets.

126
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:35,916
We'll have enough "fuck you" in this
place to really hurt some feelings.

127
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,024
I knew you'd come.

128
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:47,862
I knew you'd save us.

129
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
Well, I'll do my best.

130
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:58,440
How are we gonna fight? I mean, your
fucking truck, man, it's a piece of shit.

131
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:02,445
Gotta be some other
vehicles nearby.

132
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:11,421
Keys?

133
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,126
Shut the fuck up. OK? Fuck you, Greg.
Fuck you.

134
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,528
First you take my wife,
now you want my car?

135
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,231
This is my livelihood.

136
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:25,268
It's for the greater good, so...

137
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:29,140
- Listen to the man.
- Oh, yeah. I do not like him.

138
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:30,608
Shut up, buddy.

139
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:33,044
He's the one.

140
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:36,114
You believe.

141
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,984
Greg, roughly around the
time you fed a baby

142
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:41,353
to those things out there,

143
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:44,157
the magic between us
disappeared, OK?

144
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:49,996
We're taking a break.

145
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:59,974
How does that feel?

146
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,550
We break
into four groups of two.

147
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:12,453
If we're separated,
they can't bunch up.

148
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:14,622
Our chances for survival
increase dramatically.

149
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:19,494
You two, Rent-a-Wreck and
Jor-El, we're alpha team.

150
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:20,429
We're drawing them out.

151
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,499
We form a triangle, guard each
other's backs and protect the women.

152
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,404
And once we've breached that
front door, follow us out.

153
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:33,610
Stay in your groups,
head for that car lot.

154
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:36,946
You. You must make it.

155
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:40,983
Get those keys from the office fast,
'cause those things will be coming.

156
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:42,619
What about me?

157
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,154
You're staying, shitpants.

158
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:45,622
I'll have no more of that now.

159
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:47,391
Nobody's left behind,
everybody's coming.

160
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:49,493
Fuck that.
He's half brain-dead.

161
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,962
It doesn't matter, you hear?

162
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:54,299
The rest of you hear me?

163
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,602
No one is left behind.

164
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:01,040
Now, share the credo.

165
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:22,997
You ever used
one of these before?

166
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:30,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Let me show you.

167
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,048
Now, you take Mr. Bullet here..

168
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:43,551
...and you load him right...

169
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:46,420
...right into the chamber there.

170
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:51,226
And you cock
the trigger, all right?

171
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:55,598
Take your time when you aim.

172
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,538
All right, now.
You gently squeeze the trigger.

173
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:05,608
Hammer hits the pin,
there's an explosion,

174
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:09,412
and Mr. Bullet
travels down the barrel.

175
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:12,217
He pops out.

176
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,252
And if your aim is true...

177
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,455
Whew...

178
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,498
You gonna be able to handle
that, little lady?

179
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,533
Oh, I can handle it.

180
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,268
All right.

181
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,706
I like what I see.

182
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,784
What the fuck?

183
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,161
It was just an accident.
It just went off.

184
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,464
It just went off.

185
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,100
Way to go.

186
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:05,807
Oh, shit.

187
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,576
Go in the cell. Go in the cell.
Get in the cell.

188
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:11,613
This way, killer.

189
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:13,781
Oh, Jesus.

190
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:15,852
Come on.

191
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:23,359
So what the fuck do we do now?

192
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:27,396
- We gotta get the guns.
- We don't have a key.

193
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:29,600
Nobody asked me.

194
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:32,869
So who's going, then, huh?

195
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,638
Because I sure as shit
ain't going. Fuck that.

196
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:42,580
- All right, go. Go.
- This is really some fucked-up shit.

197
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,415
This is fucked up.
You know this is fucked up.

198
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,619
This is the part where the
brother usually dies. Listen.

199
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,655
If you hear anything,
pull me back.

200
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:55,461
Fuck. I can't stand that bitch.

201
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:26,327
OK, OK, OK.

202
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:13,445
This is really fucked up.

203
00:22:22,822 --> 00:22:25,290
Oh, shit.

204
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,427
Did you hear something?

205
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,971
What was that?

206
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,915
- Wait, wait.
- Pull.

207
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,987
- Jesus.
- Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull him in.

208
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,288
Oh, Jesus!

209
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,889
Stay down!

210
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,960
Fuck.

211
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,497
Pull!

212
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,049
You fucking asshole!

213
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,796
Oh, shit.

214
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:34,599
Shit.

215
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:41,806
What the fuck is that sound?

216
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:46,512
It's a goddamn monster alarm.

217
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:51,016
It's drawing them away.

218
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:53,887
They're chasing
the fucking sound.

219
00:23:55,588 --> 00:23:58,424
What the fuck happened with the guns?

220
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:00,526
- Where are the keys?
- Fuck if I know.

221
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:04,497
Get this shit off me. Get me
out of this fucking thing.

222
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:06,801
Get me out of this shit.

223
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:23,585
We gotta get the fuck
out of this town.

224
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:42,839
- Hurry. Come on, come on.
- Go. Go.

225
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:52,915
- Go.
- Ladies first.

226
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,752
Go ahead.

227
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:55,886
I... I know what you're up to.

228
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:59,157
- I know what you're up to.
- Shut the fuck up.

229
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:02,025
I can use a shield.

230
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:03,762
Hey.

231
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:08,167
Where the hell are you going,
motherfucker?

232
00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:24,418
Come on, little guy.

233
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,011
Last stop, shitbag.

234
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,527
Don't taste so good.

235
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:28,953
- Double-crossing sleazebag.
- Listen. No, no, no.

236
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,122
You don't fucking understand.
I wasn't trying to screw you.

237
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,892
- Shut up. They'll hear you.
- Jesus.

238
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,630
- God.
- Jesus.

239
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,234
All right, listen.
Listen, I... I...

240
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,869
Listen, would you
stop fucking hitting me?

241
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,073
I'm not fucking with you, OK? I just
didn't know how to tell you this before.

242
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:52,545
- I do not have enough cars.
- Be quiet! Shh!

243
00:26:52,546 --> 00:26:54,013
I don't have enough cars
for everyone, OK?

244
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:56,115
But, listen, I'm telling you,
if we stay...

245
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,517
Be quiet! Shut up.

246
00:26:57,518 --> 00:27:01,088
Listen. Listen. No, no, no. We
can do this, OK? - Shh!

247
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,590
If we stick together. All we
gotta do is stick together, OK?

248
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:05,259
Fuck your boss.
I can't stand that bitch.

249
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,628
But you, you and me,
if we stick together,

250
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:10,064
if we stick together...

251
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,937
...together...
Together!

252
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:18,641
Oh, no! Somebody!

253
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:54,713
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Ohh!

254
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:12,231
Hurry up and open the safe, pipehead,
and let's get the fuck out of here.

255
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:32,921
Oh, God. Oh, God.

256
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,758
OK.

257
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,766
Oh, yeah.

258
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,178
You will remember.

259
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:59,883
Visualize.

260
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:03,654
OK, OK.

261
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,889
Visualize.

262
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,793
OK.

263
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:56,243
Let's go.

264
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:32,882
Ow! My leg!

265
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:36,855
Ow! Ow!

266
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:56,976
- What is this thing?
- This is my house. And you're trespassing.

267
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:03,849
- Meth lab.
- We're buried. We're safe down here.

268
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,985
Safe, my ass.

269
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,562
Let's get the hell out of here.

270
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:32,146
Come on, let's go!

271
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:09,453
Goddamn it.

272
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:12,223
Come on,
let's get the hell out of here!

273
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:15,893
What the fuck are you doing?

274
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,261
I'm glad that still works.

275
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:18,530
Get out of there.

276
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:20,266
Just a sec. Ahh!

277
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:25,937
Help!

278
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:40,354
Come on!

279
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:55,670
Don't let me die!

280
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,142
Help! Help!

281
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,369
Fuck you!

282
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:02,009
Hey.

283
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:07,613
Wait a minute. Wait!

284
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:11,250
- Wait.
- Wait for us.

285
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:15,090
Hey. Wait. Hey.

286
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:20,160
- Wait a minute, lady!
- No!

287
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:22,597
Hey!

288
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,793
Fuck.

289
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:59,234
Be gone, foul beasts.
Begone.

290
00:35:59,235 --> 00:36:03,305
Back, I say. Back, demon.

291
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:05,474
Back.

292
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:06,709
Get back.

293
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,778
Back. Back.

294
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:11,248
Back.

295
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:18,288
Begone.

296
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:22,192
A-ha! Ha!

297
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:25,430
I did it again.

298
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,608
Come out, wee one.

299
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:38,543
Don't be afraid.

300
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:42,380
- Who are you?
- Stand back and be amazed.

301
00:36:43,716 --> 00:36:48,655
Yes, I am he. The Prophet.

302
00:36:54,394 --> 00:36:57,364
I got the gift, faggots. Ha-ha.

303
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,933
I control the monsters.

304
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:03,737
I wish them to leave
and they leave.

305
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:08,942
You must go underground
through the sewers.

306
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:10,378
The way to the big city.

307
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:12,313
You want us to take these
fucking storm drains

308
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,481
all the way
back to the big city?

309
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,716
Don't talk to
the Prophet that way.

310
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:17,852
Bitch, I will fuck you up.

311
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,754
Hey, hey, hey, dipshit.

312
00:37:19,755 --> 00:37:24,793
Listen, this guy
just saved our asses, OK?

313
00:37:24,794 --> 00:37:26,895
If he says take the storm drain,

314
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,665
we better sure as shit
take the storm drain.

315
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:34,469
Be cool. Let's play
this thing out.

316
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,940
Come, we must act quickly.

317
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:39,577
I'll bring up the rear.

318
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:50,754
What the fuck was that, old man?

319
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,958
Shut the fuck up,
you dimwitted cunt.

320
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:56,393
We can slow down.

321
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:59,028
I feel the monsters' presence
dissipating.

322
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:01,997
You saved our ass, Moses.

323
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:05,369
We're much obliged.

324
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:09,440
I can't see nothing down here.

325
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,482
You OK, sweetie?

326
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:01,596
We're not alone.

327
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,419
You hear that?

328
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:37,535
- No, I hear it too.
- Hold up.

329
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,173
What?

330
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:45,176
It's your head.
Coming from your head.

331
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:46,477
Get off me. Get off me.

332
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:51,450
Ringing like a fucking tea kettle.
You're gonna give us away.

333
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,185
I have it turned up so
I can hear better.

334
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:57,189
Is that better?

335
00:40:57,557 --> 00:41:02,127
Holy fucking shit.

336
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:03,062
Oh, shit.

337
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:08,034
- They're tracking us.
- Language, please.

338
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:28,789
Oh, boy.

339
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,059
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:43,706
Watch it.

341
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:49,545
- Which way do we go?
- I don't know.

342
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:52,249
Ask Jesus back there.

343
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:56,954
Hold on.
I gotta feel this one.

344
00:41:58,956 --> 00:42:01,559
We're clear.

345
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:05,796
- Come on, let's go.
- Get out of my way.

346
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:08,165
- What?
- Get out of my way.

347
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:24,883
Slide under. Go.

348
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:26,786
I got it.

349
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:43,037
This is heavy.

350
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:48,042
Wait, wait, wait.

351
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:51,579
It's the Puker!

352
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,217
Blood makes it feel good.

353
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:23,013
Goddamn it! Help her!

354
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:39,730
Help her, motherfucker!

355
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,879
No!

356
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,948
Those motherfuckers are dead!

357
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:28,916
Oh, yeah!

358
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,819
Who are you?

359
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:37,694
A few days ago,
I was my parents' son.

360
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:42,665
Two days ago,
I was just another victim.

361
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:46,336
Yesterday, I was born again.

362
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,174
And today...

363
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:55,913
...I'm a wasteland warrior.

364
00:45:00,452 --> 00:45:05,923
How can I die when I'm a
registered lethal weapon?

365
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:13,198
Badass motherfucker. Ha!
Karate.

366
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,269
Way to go, Merlin.

367
00:45:21,107 --> 00:45:25,044
- My gift only works on monsters.
- Sure it does.

368
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:27,947
Well, maybe if you hadn't
have had me turn down my ears,

369
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:29,716
I could have at least
heard them.

370
00:45:29,717 --> 00:45:31,818
I've been tracking you guys
for a little while.

371
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:36,124
I had to make sure
you weren't infected.

372
00:45:41,162 --> 00:45:42,763
I'm sorry for your loss.

373
00:45:42,764 --> 00:45:45,199
She looked to be
quite the fighter.

374
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,468
Save your sorry
for someone else, macho.

375
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:52,207
We're looking for the right way to go.
Will you help us?

376
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,410
Well, there's too many of us
to run topside.

377
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:59,014
They're picking off survivors
left and right.

378
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:09,425
It's not for that.
I've been using it to see.

379
00:46:09,426 --> 00:46:13,263
Baking soda, peroxide and pop.

380
00:46:18,136 --> 00:46:21,872
That manhole up there,
we ought to close it.

381
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:26,309
- We don't want nobody coming down here.
- Good thinking.

382
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,882
- Yeah.
- I got it, Pops.

383
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,594
You must be a military man.

384
00:47:13,595 --> 00:47:16,030
Oh, yeah. Marines?

385
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:16,398
Yup.

386
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:21,971
Intuition like that only comes
from battle experience.

387
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:28,477
Fuck! Ahh!

388
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:46,163
Get up. Lift him up.

389
00:48:02,248 --> 00:48:04,349
Back, demon.

390
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,486
Foul beast, I command you.

391
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,993
Back. Back, I say.

392
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:16,930
Back. Back.

393
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:39,655
Let's go, man.

394
00:48:39,656 --> 00:48:43,292
We'll catch up
with your little friends.

395
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:09,619
The doc will put your arm back.

396
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,187
It's useless. Forget it.

397
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:13,391
Wait. Wait.

398
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,734
Easy, easy, easy.

399
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:30,509
Easy, easy.

400
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,621
In the backpack,

401
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:44,557
the bottles.

402
00:49:44,558 --> 00:49:47,193
Grab another bottle.
We can't go in the dark.

403
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:48,194
Yeah?

404
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:49,428
Wait.

405
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:51,199
Hold this.

406
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:53,200
Hold it.

407
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,670
Hold your goddamn hand out.

408
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,014
Hurry up.

409
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:08,751
Throw it.

410
00:50:11,754 --> 00:50:15,492
We got to find
a way out of here...

411
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:18,628
...fast.

412
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:32,042
Dumbshit!

413
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:34,779
You threw him to the beast.

414
00:50:50,095 --> 00:50:55,101
We're getting closer to rejoining
your friends, my little one.

415
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:13,220
What was that?

416
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:18,660
I don't reckon
we're alone here, partner.

417
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:22,629
You in any shape to fight, son?

418
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,466
I just got my arm bitten off.

419
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:28,268
Yeah, well,
you better walk it off.

420
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:33,109
One of them suckers
are in here with us right now.

421
00:51:47,157 --> 00:51:51,327
Motherfucker, die!

422
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,902
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

423
00:51:58,903 --> 00:52:02,405
Stay with me!
Stay with me, sonny boy!

424
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:03,406
Stay with me!

425
00:52:08,312 --> 00:52:10,749
I'm not gonna make it.

426
00:52:14,253 --> 00:52:17,388
You gotta keep fighting, son.

427
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:22,428
I'm with you.

428
00:53:55,862 --> 00:53:57,931
Ow, that really hurt.

429
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,643
Ow!

430
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:28,431
Piece of shit.

431
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,746
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

432
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,848
Oh, fuck!

433
00:54:49,988 --> 00:54:53,356
Take it easy. Come on,
take it easy. You're OK.

434
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:55,393
Yeah, speak for yourself.

435
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:57,661
Shit.

436
00:54:57,662 --> 00:54:58,929
We gotta stop that bleeding.

437
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,932
It's too fucking dark
in here. I can't see.

438
00:55:01,933 --> 00:55:05,070
Lean over, lean over.
I got an idea.

439
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:12,611
You're a smart hombre.

440
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:17,616
This is going to sting
just a little bit.

441
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:20,920
Mother of Mary. God.

442
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:24,123
I got a bullet from
a hunting trip here, son.

443
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:27,027
You're not doing
what I think you're doing.

444
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:29,929
Well, we gotta close
that wound, son.

445
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,433
What?

446
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:42,142
We gotta... Somehow we gotta
pour it in deep here.

447
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:45,513
Real deep.

448
00:55:50,652 --> 00:55:51,786
That's a lot, dude.

449
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:54,756
Hey, listen, this is
battlefield surgery, son.

450
00:55:54,757 --> 00:55:55,691
It's very delicate.

451
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:59,461
I mean, you're the fucking
patient, I'm the goddamn doctor.

452
00:55:59,462 --> 00:56:02,064
Just let me do my fucking thing,
will you?

453
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:05,067
One more, that's all.

454
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:09,138
All right, now, I need a match.

455
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:11,008
I got one, I got one.

456
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:14,644
- Did you learn this in the marines?
- No.

457
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:16,947
- Rambo III.
- What?

458
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:23,154
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck!

459
00:56:23,155 --> 00:56:25,589
Whoa, what the fuck?

460
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,427
What the fuck?

461
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:29,726
Greg, he's not a baby.

462
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:38,068
He's not the baby, Greg.

463
00:57:59,658 --> 00:58:02,528
Greg, stop it.

464
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,016
We gotta keep moving, son.

465
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,290
I look like a goddamn
Foosball player.

466
00:59:07,865 --> 00:59:11,768
I know it looks
bad right now, son.

467
00:59:11,769 --> 00:59:14,638
Yeah, it looks
real bad, all right?

468
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,008
Why don't you just
chew off my dick?

469
00:59:18,009 --> 00:59:20,913
We'll call it a day.

470
00:59:26,685 --> 00:59:31,055
Look, you keep fighting
until the end.

471
00:59:31,056 --> 00:59:34,995
You suck it up and you fight.

472
00:59:52,913 --> 00:59:55,215
Stay with me, fuckers.

473
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,720
Who knows what the fuck
is out there.

474
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:08,429
I like your skin.

475
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:12,000
So soft. So colorful.

476
01:00:12,001 --> 01:00:14,102
- Get back!
- I like it.

477
01:00:14,103 --> 01:00:17,372
- Get fucking back!
- Can I touch it?

478
01:00:17,373 --> 01:00:20,742
I will fucking break
your fucking cunt head!

479
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:24,081
- I wanna touch it.
- Get back!

480
01:00:30,954 --> 01:00:33,956
There's your power.

481
01:00:33,957 --> 01:00:37,362
Where's your power, lady?

482
01:00:43,134 --> 01:00:47,404
- You hear that?
- What?

483
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:48,306
What are you doing?

484
01:00:48,307 --> 01:00:53,344
We go in hard, we go in fast,
we'll kill them all.

485
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:57,415
What? How?
I don't have any arms.

486
01:00:57,416 --> 01:01:00,752
You only need legs
to kick ass, baby boy.

487
01:01:00,753 --> 01:01:04,924
- Kill them fucking baboons.
- Shit.

488
01:01:09,129 --> 01:01:13,265
That's what you got me for!

489
01:01:24,078 --> 01:01:26,180
Yeah!

490
01:02:02,987 --> 01:02:07,492
That's how you
gut a bitch, bitch.

491
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:19,471
Back, demon.
Back, I say.

492
01:02:19,472 --> 01:02:21,841
That's right, demon.

493
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:03,886
Ahh!

494
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:35,019
I said jump high, baby boy.

495
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,655
Now!

496
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:48,334
Goddamn freaks!

497
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:54,406
You shithead. Come on.

498
01:03:54,407 --> 01:03:57,010
Let's get out of here.

499
01:03:58,144 --> 01:04:00,680
Come on.
They're coming. This way.

500
01:04:00,681 --> 01:04:05,351
Check your ass,
baby boy. They're coming.

501
01:04:05,352 --> 01:04:09,990
Go to the ladder. The ladder.

502
01:04:10,991 --> 01:04:12,259
Come on.

503
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,298
Come on,
get up the goddamn ladder.

504
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,167
All right.

505
01:04:20,168 --> 01:04:21,368
Fucking shit.

506
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:24,539
What do we do?
What the fuck do we do?

507
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,342
Come on, come on,
come on. On my back.

508
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:31,380
Let's go, jump on. Get up there.

509
01:04:38,255 --> 01:04:40,057
Come on, get up.

510
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,372
You guys wait here.

511
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:01,145
I'm fucked.

512
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,016
You can make it.

513
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:07,152
You can.

514
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:15,528
Get up there.

515
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,565
Give me your hand.

516
01:05:19,566 --> 01:05:23,703
Give me your hand.
Come on, you can make it.

517
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:36,082
Help. Help me, woman.

518
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,450
Help me.

519
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:41,156
Up. Up. Up!

520
01:05:47,162 --> 01:05:48,295
Give me your hand.

521
01:05:48,296 --> 01:05:51,033
Come on, give me your hand.

522
01:06:33,846 --> 01:06:36,849
Oh, my God.

523
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:17,593
Dead end.

524
01:07:18,293 --> 01:07:20,863
What the fuck do we do now?

525
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:25,634
Open it.

526
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:43,921
Oh, shit.

527
01:07:53,331 --> 01:07:53,932
I got this.

528
01:07:53,933 --> 01:07:56,567
I'm about to dazzle
the shit out of you.

529
01:07:56,568 --> 01:08:00,705
Back, demon. Back, I say.

530
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:03,408
That's right, demon.
Back. Back.

531
01:08:05,645 --> 01:08:08,547
- Get back, demon.
- Oh, shit.

532
01:08:08,548 --> 01:08:11,683
Back, demon.

533
01:08:11,684 --> 01:08:14,387
Back.

534
01:08:14,388 --> 01:08:15,821
Feel my power. Back.

535
01:08:15,822 --> 01:08:21,327
Dumb shit. It's your hearing aid
that's keeping him back, not you.

536
01:08:21,328 --> 01:08:22,963
What?

537
01:08:23,597 --> 01:08:25,733
Oh, shit!

538
01:08:27,235 --> 01:08:30,672
Lift it. Lift it.

539
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:57,233
- I'm stuck.
- The pipe is stuck.

540
01:08:57,234 --> 01:09:00,670
Pull it.

541
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:11,282
The pipe, pull it through.

542
01:09:23,595 --> 01:09:26,732
Slasher?

543
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:33,605
Oh, no.

544
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:40,046
No!

545
01:10:35,406 --> 01:10:36,807
That's it.

546
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:09,075
Hit that mother!
Hit that mother!

547
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,498
Fucking dirt bike.

548
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,957
- Oh!
- Whoa!

549
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:36,635
I'm already dead.

550
01:12:36,636 --> 01:12:38,472
You won't get far.

551
01:12:38,473 --> 01:12:41,509
I'll take him away
as far as I can.

552
01:12:52,654 --> 01:12:54,690
Thank you.

553
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:39,703
Shit.

554
01:13:39,704 --> 01:13:43,008
We're the only ones left.

555
01:13:43,009 --> 01:13:46,011
The world has gone to hell.

556
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:48,313
We have to...

557
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:49,314
We gotta do something.

558
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:50,782
I'll tell you what we gotta do.

559
01:13:50,783 --> 01:13:56,022
We gotta repopulate the Earth,
that's what we gotta do.

560
01:13:56,023 --> 01:14:00,060
We gotta start fucking.
Right now.

561
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:15,200
Goddamn it.
