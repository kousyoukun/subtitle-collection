1
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:44,767
This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 22 7.

2
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,141
I guess this will be
my last will and testament.

3
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,373
This is for Diane.

4
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,413
When this day is over, they're gonna come
and talk to you about this...

5
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,786
...and they're gonna-- They're gonna
tell you what happened, Diane.

6
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,053
But what they tell you
is not really what happened here.

7
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,198
So I hope that you get this.

8
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,995
I was trying to do a good thing.

9
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,781
Police! Get down! Everybody, down!

10
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,086
Down! Get down!

11
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,259
Go, go, go! Come on!

12
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,593
-Clear.
-Police. Get down.

13
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,132
Deal it off.

14
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,135
Agent 1 0-1 0, we're all secure.

15
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,663
All right, we're out of here.

16
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,331
lt's clear.

17
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,671
You smell that?

18
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,051
Couple hours. We gotta move now.
Would you turn that thing off?

19
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,489
All right, who's downstairs
we don't need?

20
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,304
lt's all yours. Good luck.

21
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,310
l hate to do this, Jack, but l need you
to sit on this until uniforms get here.

22
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,817
-All right.
-Just hang until you're relieved.

23
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,478
All right.

24
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,982
Don't touch anything.

25
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,824
Any word on the suspects?

26
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,234
-What do you want me to tell you?
-What did you tell them?

27
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,500
l saw someone out there.

28
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,605
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

29
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,748
-Anything for me?
-Breath mints.

30
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,824
Sergeant Cannova called.
Wants you to write up this wire request.

31
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,427
Said to make sure
you get the right dates on them.

32
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,190
The particulars are on your desk,
and he needs it by tonight.

33
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,227
All right.

34
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,834
All right, well, we can have an officer
come by about 8 a.m. tomorrow.

35
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,747
You gave her two?

36
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,356
Well, you know, we do what we can.

37
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,993
Hey, Jack, l forgot to tell you,
the lieutenant's looking for you.

38
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,138
He wants you to find him right away.

39
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,767
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,639
Well, listen.
All right, well, l'll call you.

41
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,374
Hey, Mosley.

42
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,175
-Mosley.
-Yeah.

43
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,287
Grace tell you to find me?

44
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,425
-Yeah, just a minute ago.
-All right, need a favor.

45
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,220
Get this guy from lockup
and run him to Centre Dtreet.

46
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,126
The DA needs him ADAP. He's gotta be
in front of a grand jury before 1 0.

47
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,894
l signed out.

48
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,797
You signed the sheet?

49
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,502
Well, not technically, no.
But l mean, l'm signed out.

50
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,266
Then consider yourself on overtime.

51
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,741
Captain Gruber called.
We need this thing done.

52
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,073
Don't you got some mutt
that takes care of this?

53
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,978
l got Keenan, but he's still on the Verrazano.
He's behind some overturned truck.

54
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,253
l'm tired. l mean, look, normally,
you know me, l don't say no.

55
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,417
l know you been
working all night, Jack...

56
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,189
...but who's the detective
and who's the lieutenant here?

57
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,629
l mean, Jack, l got nobody else.

58
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,734
lt's a nothing thing.

59
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,360
One hundred and eighteen minutes
to get a little hemorrhoid 1 6 blocks.

60
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,408
l'll let you come in
to work late tomorrow.

61
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,269
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,934
Edward Bunker.

63
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,601
Yeah, that's me, officer.
Eddie Bunker, right here.

64
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,940
Down here, the last cell.

65
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,776
-Come back in an hour.
-What do you mean, come back?

66
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,077
He's supposed to wear a suit
when he leaves.

67
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,551
-And?
-lt's not here yet.

68
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,122
Just get him out here, all right?

69
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,020
They said he'd wear a suit.

70
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:11,095
No, yeah, l'm supposed to get a suit.
lt's a three-piece suit. lt's gray.

71
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,663
lt's got-- Wait. Yeah.

72
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,824
lt's a three-button, it's gray,
it's got cuffs on the pants.

73
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,835
They brought the catalog down.
l picked it out of the catalog.

74
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,973
l'm not supposed
to leave without it. Wait.

75
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,233
l'm not supposed to leave
without that suit.

76
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,072
-You tell it to him.
-No, that's why you brought my shoelaces.

77
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,043
-Come on, come on.
-l'm not supposed to.

78
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,184
-Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right?
-Yeah, you sure?

79
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,683
The old lady goes into the car,
otherwise she dies.

80
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,082
-You think so?
-Yeah, man.

81
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:40,021
That's what-- l don't know. You gotta
figure out the answer for yourself.

82
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,856
Everybody just calm down.
Officer, l'm going to court.

83
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,657
-l'm supposed to have a suit.
-Hey.

84
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,027
Shut up. Here's your property.

85
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,465
-lt's not a good sign.
-Hands behind your back.

86
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,797
-Hold on, l'm trying--
-Hands behind your back.

87
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,204
l don't even have my--
All my prop-- Wait one minute.

88
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,336
lt's not right.
They promised me the suit.

89
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,640
l picked it out of the catalog--
Wait, my book.

90
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,909
l can't leave without my book.
My book is very important to me.

91
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,115
Why are we rushing like this?
lt's not a good sign.

92
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,313
-Hey.
-What's the damn answer?

93
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,857
-Hey!
-Shut up.

94
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,494
-l hate police.
-Half a tank.

95
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,295
You could have had
a little more patience.

96
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,837
This suit don't mean nothing to you.
You probably got a bunch of suits.

97
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,703
But it's a whole different thing to me.

98
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,016
These cars don't ever change, huh?

99
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,249
Traditional cruisers.

100
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,396
And the same retarded hump
in the middle.

101
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,861
Smell the same way,
like Lysol and vomit.

102
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,169
l hope nobody vomited back here.
They probably did.

103
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,577
Hey, man, let me ask you something.

104
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,081
l'm trying to figure this out.

105
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,284
You driving along
in your hurricane, right?

106
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,822
There's three people at the bus stop.

107
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,018
Yeah, one is an old lady.
Dhe's sick, she about to die.

108
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,790
The second one is your best friend.

109
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,093
He saved your life, right?

110
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,635
And the third is the girl of your dreams.

111
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,796
right, but check it out...

112
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,267
...you only got space in the car
for one person.

113
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,480
right? Who you take?

114
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,845
lt's a riddle that's supposed to tell
what type of person you are...

115
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,610
...like where you at in your life.

116
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,347
lt's a hypothetical question, man, damn.

117
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,855
lt's just a hypothetical--

118
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,654
Well, good. Fine, good.
l guess that's my answer.

119
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,599
Why don't you get
on the loudspeaker?

120
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,640
Put the Hawaii Five-O light on
or something.

121
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,938
Use your police power.
Put on a little siren.

122
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,910
Make room, make a hole.

123
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,949
lsn't that the saying,
''Make a hole, make a hole''?

124
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,243
Go on, make a hole.

125
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:31,092
Digns. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs.
All over, man.

126
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,758
l used to not even see
nothing like that, man.

127
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:38,370
And then l start seeing them.
And l start looking for them.

128
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,968
And everything just start falling in place.

129
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,209
l'm gonna be all right,
where l'm supposed to be.

130
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,409
l ain't got my suit,
but once they get my testimony...

131
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,949
...they drop my charges, l'm free.

132
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,552
lt's making sense to me.

133
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,885
l believe in that.

134
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,717
Being in the right place.

135
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,724
Being where you supposed to be.
You believe in that?

136
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,886
l believe life's too long
and guys like you make it even longer.

137
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,200
Life's too long?

138
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,232
Damn.

139
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,336
That's some cold shit, man. l ain't never
heard nobody say no shit like that.

140
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,640
Usually you hear about people
trying to make their life longer, you know?

141
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,375
Trying to stay alive a little longer.
You sound a little...

142
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,849
...depressed or something, you all right?

143
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,314
You stopping?

144
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,086
This ain't the courthouse, man.
What you doing?

145
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,321
Yo.

146
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,891
Yo, why you stopping?

147
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,401
You gonna rush me out to court,
and now you stopping? What are you--?

148
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,732
Hey. Hey, man.

149
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,708
Hey, man. Listen, man, l got an important
appointment after my court date, man.

150
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,644
That shit ain't funny, man.
Come on, man. lt's not a game, man.

151
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,374
Yo.

152
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,243
Dome bullshit, man.

153
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,218
Hey. Hey!

154
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,951
No, man. lt ain't Miller Time, man.

155
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,195
The weather will be clear early morning,
but the rest of the day....

156
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,269
Dam. Hey, Angela.

157
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,840
So we are looking at a hot, humid day.

158
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,272
Looks like temperature
might reach 1 OO degrees...

159
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,344
...so don't forget
to pack your sunscreen.

160
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,208
Add a pack of these, will you?

161
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,908
l know this dude smelled funny.
l got the wrong dude, man.

162
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,051
1 7.50. What?

163
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,521
Hey, don't open it. Come over here.

164
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,390
What time is it, man?

165
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,324
lt's 8:1 1 .

166
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,796
That's a good sign. That's a good sign.

00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,766

168
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,035
-Want change?
-No, you keep the change.

169
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,700
Keep the change.
All right, you have a good day.

170
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,177
-l don't want the peanuts.
-Bye.

171
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,775
No, man. Can't do nothing for you,
understand?

172
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,511
Hey, you better give me that change.
l'm gonna need that.

173
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,245
You see my situation right here?

174
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,787
No, no, no! No, no, no!

175
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,091
Hey!

176
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,006

00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,998
-Come on.
-Help me. Help me.

178
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:46,851
-My book. Why did you stop?
-Go, left, go. Left.

179
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,886
Move. Move. Move.

180
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,717

182
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,390
Dhit.

183
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,523
Hey!

184
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,762
Just get out of here, now!
Go on. Go!

185
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,935
Come on, let's go.
That way, let's go. Go, go.

186
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,579

Let's go. Go.

-Dominic, get people out of here, right now.
-Jesus, Jackie. What's going on?

189
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,729
-Everybody. You too.
-All right, okay.

190
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,536

Come on, keep going. Come on.
Come on, move it.

193
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:54,018
Yeah, this is Detective Jack Mosley,
shield number 227.

194
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,451
l am 1 0-1 3, at-- Hold on a minute.

195
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,616
-Dominic, what's the address here?

196
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,694
1 33 Mulberry.

00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,456
Mulberry Dtreet.

198
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,533
All right.

199
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,973
ls they coming?

200
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,581
l don't know why you stopped, man.

201
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,886
l don't know why
you would do that, man.

202
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,854
They said you were nobody.

203
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,758
-l ain't nobody.
-Shut up.

204
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,900
You a wino. You need to stop drinking,
that's what you need.

205
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,230
Shut up.

206
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,714
Jack?

207
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,583
-Frank.
-Hey.

208
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,615
You all right?

209
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,347
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

210
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,323
We were on Mott when the call went out.
Heard it was you.

211
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,594
Got here as soon as we could.

212
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,734
Oh, hi.

213
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,439
-Hey.
-You all right?

214
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,075
-Yeah, l'm all right.
-You having fun?

215
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,202
-No.
-No? Oh, well.

216
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,544
Gotta have fun.

217
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,253
-What's up, Jack?
-Hey, man. Hi.

218
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,555
You did a really great, great job, man.

219
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,923
You got yourself a bad guy.

220
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,458
Been a while, huh? Yeah.

221
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:53,799
We got the second shooter
half a block from here, so it's done.

222
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,441
-Dure you're okay?
-Yeah.

223
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,068
l'm just getting my wind. l was running.

224
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,616
Why don't you let us take it from here.

225
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,081
Oh, yeah.

226
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,814
We'll get the kid where he belongs,
and you don't have to worry about a thing.

227
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,215
-We'll get you home.
-Yes, please.

228
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,953
Please, please, officer.
That's a very good idea...

229
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,064
...because, honestly, l don't think
this dude is doing too good.

230
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,460
l told him not to stop.

231
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,124
l asked him not to stop.
He just had to stop.

232
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,999
That's when everything happened.
Dude came to the window.

233
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,663
l have a very important
appointment aft--

234
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,275
Jack.

235
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,642
Hey, Dhue.

236
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,345
Come on. Here.

237
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,047
Why don't you take this. Come on.

238
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,819
We'll get you out of here.
Got a car waiting. All right?

239
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,427
Get some sleep.

240
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,423
Jack?

241
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,864
The kid was gonna testify against Jerry.

242
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,032
He saw Jerry doing some business.

243
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:39,071
Now, we both know that Jerry has never
been a standup guy like you and me.

244
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:45,072
He'll roll over, they indict him.
We can't have that.

245
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,845
No. lt's gonna hurt a lot of us.

246
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,222
Come on.

247
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,732
Dee, this whole thing caught us--
lt caught us completely unaware.

248
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,807
lt was supposed to be
Teach's nephew driving him.

249
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,506
But he got stuck out there in traffic,
who knows where...

250
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,675
...so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.

251
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,915
You know, just the wrong time
and the wrong place for you today.

252
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:33,694
All right. Now, you know that l would never
put you in a position like this, right?

253
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,890
You know that, huh?

254
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,094
And l never figured
you'd cap one of those guys.

255
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,836
-That's what l get for hiring drug addicts.
-Grab the gun.

256
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,905
Grab the gun. There you go.

257
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,408
Come on. Frank?

258
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,647
-Here we go.
-All right, here we go. Jack.

259
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,120
Dqueeze the trigger.

260
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,059
All right. Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

261
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,600
l figure it like this.

262
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,635
You.... You pop the guys
trying to spring the kid.

263
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,572
The kid, well, he gets your gun.

264
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,370
And he takes you hostage.

265
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,983
Do we came in and saved the day.

266
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,449
He died, you lived.

267
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,915
Now, this could be a good thing
for you, Jack.

268
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,490
Get you back where you belong.

269
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,299
-Are you still with...?
-Dtand up.

270
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,873
-You still with what's-her-name?
-Come on, stand up.

271
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,334
-What are you waiting for?
-What's her name?

272
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,625
Caroline.

273
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,496
lt's Caroline.

274
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,695
This changes everything, Jack.

275
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,531
Over here.

276
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,108
Come on, Frank.

277
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,657
Kid, get up. Come on.

278
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,595
Dhit. Man, shit.

279
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,663
All right, Jack, it's 8:25.

280
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,571
-You stay there.
-Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 1 0.

281
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,443
All right? The kid gets there
one minute past, all this...

282
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,482
...it doesn't matter.

283
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,422
And all you gotta do
is look the other way.

284
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,526
All right? We still got options here.

285
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,991
Okay?

286
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,390
We just want the kid.

287
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,063
Jack, Jack, Jack,
just let me help you.

288
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,763
All right?

289
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,564
Back up.

290
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,833
Jack, once you go out that door...

291
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,977
...l can't help you.

292
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,276
Please just back up, Frank.
Just back up.

293
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,962
He shot a cop.

294
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,833
What the hell did you see?
What did you see?

295
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,772
That cop back there.

296
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,571
l seen him around my way...

297
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,772
...holding a gun in this
little Puerto rican kid's mouth.

298
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,746
Come on. Let's go.

299
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,012
He said he'd kill his mother
if he testified.

300
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,115
What you doing that for?
We need that.

301
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,590
The shell in that gun was over 20 years old.
Lucky it went off at all.

302
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,821
-They didn't tell you Dhue was a cop?
-No, they didn't tell me.

303
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,090
They showed me a picture, that was it.

304
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,327
Well, congratulations, because you're about
to testify against one of New York's worst.

305
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,472
-What?
-Fellas, look, the clock's ticking.

306
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,767
He's gotta be at the courthouse by 1 0.
We know where he's going.

307
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,309
Mulvey, you're coming with me.

308
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,939
-Know where you're going?
-Take the north side.

309
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,741
-You got it, let's go.
-Come on.

310
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,817
-Captain.
-Where are we, Frank?

311
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,785
Well, we're putting descriptions out
over precinct channels.

312
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:56,792
No names, or that one's a cop.
lt'll help to have some eyes.

313
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,858
-How long can you sit on this?
-He shot a cop.

314
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,324
You're the precinct captain, Dan.
How long?

315
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,562
l don't know.
Hour, maybe a little more.

316
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,799
-Who's on this with you?
-My guys.

317
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:13,172
Ortiz and Maldonado from the 66.
Touhey and Kaller from the 1 1 1 .

318
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,370
A couple others
you don't wanna know about.

319
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,012
The guy was your partner for 20 years.

320
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,519
What the hell happened in there?

321
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,953
-ls he drunk?
-l don't know.

322
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,586
l don't know. We woke him up.

323
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,390
Hopefully he'll do what he always does,
and we can go back to work.

324
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,430
lf he doesn't?

325
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,438
We gotta quash this thing
before he gets his legs back.

326
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,233
These are his streets.

327
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:52,211
This could get ugly for all of us
if that kid talks.

328
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,716
-He can't talk.
-He won't talk.

329
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,688
Look, l appreciate
what you did for me back there...

330
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,518
...but l'm starting to think
you're not the dude for this.

331
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,320
l mean, you're out of breath,
you're hung-over.

332
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,759
Your leg is gonna give out on you
any second, man.

333
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,230
l got someplace l need to be at 1 2,
you understand?

334
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,301
l need to be finished at court by 1 0...

335
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,869
...or l'm not gonna get
where l'm supposed to get.

336
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,906
-You understand what l'm saying?
-All right, l understand.

337
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,511
-You're not listening to what l'm saying.
-Wait, come here. Come here.

338
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,706
Come on.

339
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,151
Hung-over.

340
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,119
A bad leg.

341
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,087
No gun.

342
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,457
-Bobby?
-Yeah?

343
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,464
-You thinking what I'm thinking?
-l'm already there.

344
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,957
Oh, God.

345
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,628
Come on, let's go.

346
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,498
Listen, just stay put right here.
l'll be right back.

347
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,004
Come on, man, don't take long.
We gotta go.

348
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,104
Hurry up.

349
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,050
-Hey, man, where your bathroom?
-What?

350
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,083
Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at?

351
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,448
Down at the end of the hall.

352
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,289
Yeah.

353
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,419
That's what you look like
when you smile, huh?

354
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,528
You was probably drinking then too.

355
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,337
There's the lady.

356
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,131
redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.

357
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,573
Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping
to get high or nothing like that.

358
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,610
Man, we gotta go.

359
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,717
Make sure you lift the seat up
before you go.

360
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,885
lt's up already.

361
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,888
Maybe you left it like that, huh?

362
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,295
l'm coming.

363
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,683
Hey, Jack.

364
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,319
Jack Mosley.

365
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,491
Why did you do that?

366
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,555
Do what?

367
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,001
Dhoot that cop.

368
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,295
Cops...

369
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,130
...they don't shoot other cops.

370
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,476
Especially over nobody like me.

371
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,184
lt's a long way to go for a stranger,
you know.

372
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,454
Thank you.

373
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,463
l never had nobody....

374
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,465
Hell, man, you know.

375
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,231
l don't rock with the police,
you know what l'm saying?

376
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,940
-Finger off the trigger.
-They never been my friend.

377
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,838
-Then here you come.
-On the ground.

378
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,911
lt's kind of bugging me out, you know.

379
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,747
You on some vigilante business.

380
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,384
Let's go.

381
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,179
-Jack--
-Put your arms around the pole.

382
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,947
l don't know what to think anymore.

383
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,423
-Here. Cuff yourself.
-What are you doing, Jack?

384
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,586
Yeah, it's a little strange.

385
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,232
You know? By any definition, this here.

386
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,163
All right, kid. Good.

387
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,893
Okay.

388
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,766
Okay, okay, okay.

389
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,870
Okay.

390
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,408
Okay.

391
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,176
You should have done
what you always do, Jack.

392
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,884
-Where's your phone?
-lt's on the left-hand side.

393
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,751
They know l'm here.
lf l don't answer it....

394
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,362
-Jack?
-Let's go, kid. Come on.

395
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,877
-Bob.
-Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank.

396
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,172
All right, I'm impressed, Jack.

397
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,476
Did you shoot him too?

398
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,120
Dend someone to check on Bobby.

399
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,021
Jack, you're not up to this.

400
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,092
All right? It's gonna end bad for you.

401
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,359
You lost the kid, didn't you?

402
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,207
He bailed on you. Well, you know what?

403
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,536
That is the best thing
that could have happened.

404
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,041
So why don't you go home.

405
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,440
Forget about what happened.

406
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,138
We'll take it from here.
Are you looking for him?

407
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,045
And you can't find him.

408
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,311
We're gonna find him, all right?

409
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,082
We're gonna find him.

410
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,985
All right, Jack, now you can hang up.

411
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,727
Where are you, kid?

412
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,724
All right. Now, let's see
which way he went.

413
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,494
Did he go up? Did he go down?

414
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,104
ln or out, Jackie.
Which way did he go?

415
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,841
Let's see if he went down.

416
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,105
-Excuse me, sir, do you mind swiping?
-Get a job, man.

417
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,010
Ma'am, would you mind swiping me in?

418
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,175
Ma'am? Ma'am, would you mind

452
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,710
Where, where, where?

453
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,038
Dhit. Where the hell is he?

454

...on Detective Torres' cell phone.
Area code (91 7 ) 935....

458
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:04,062
That cop back at the apartment,
he said you should do what you always do.

459
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,897
What did he--?
What did he mean by that?

460
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,872
You're not doing
what you always do, huh?

461

l appreciate it. You're the right guy.

465
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,810
-Okay?
-Okay.

466
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,480
-This is Comtech, over.
-Yeah, go, this is Nugent.

467
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,752
GPD indicates they're on Bowery.

468
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,953
Repeat, Bowery,
moving south towards Pell.

469
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,621
Speed indicates they're on foot.

470
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,892
Are you hearing this, boys?
He's in Chinatown.

471
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,065
Let's move in.

472
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,476
-What's the deal with that book?
-lt's my business plans.

473
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,412
l'm moving to Deattle.
My sister's already living out there.

474
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,712
l'm gonna open up a bakery.
But it's only, like, a specialty bakery.

475
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,789
Birthday cakes for little kids.
There's a lot of money in that.

476
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,790
l'm gonna send you
a big birthday cake on your birthday--

477
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,428
-l hate birthday cakes.
-You hate birthday cakes?

478
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,393
First thing that doesn't go your way...

479
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,329
...you're gonna be slipping into
Carol's Clip and Curl...

480
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,492
...and stealing all her hair-care products.

481
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,195
Because you're a thief.
And that's what you are, Eddie.

482
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,809
-You're always gonna be a thief.
-People can change, Jack.

483
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,968
-Days change, seasons change. Not people.
-Yes, you do--

484
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,343
-People don't change, Eddie.
-Yes, you do. l'll get you that cake.

485
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,177
You know what it's gonna say on top?

486
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,253
''Jack Mosley, ha-ha-ha, eat this.'' Make you
eat your words, lick your fingers too.

487
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,083
Dubject's moving west on Pell.

488
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,854
Dubject now moving south on Doyers.
Dtill moving south on Doyers.

489
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,592
Bobby, you take Doyer, we got Pell.
And, Kaller, you close up Bowery.

490
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,167
-Copy that.
-Let's squeeze him.

491
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,271
-Copy that, on my way.
-Why don't you pull up. Pull up.

492
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,207
-Dorry.
-Who is that? You can't go in here.

493
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,783
Oh, sorry.

494
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:58,433
Look, man, l gotta be down there.
All right, you understand?

495
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,711
l gotta be down there that way, and
there's streets and shit in between there.

496
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,475
You got some sort of plan?
Dome sort of police plan or something?

497
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,449
l see your limp acting up.
You ought to get that checked out.

498
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,249
l have a buddy of mine
walking around with a limp just like that.

499
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,688
He don't wanna go
to the doctor, though, right?

500
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,455
Finally he go,
they say it's a fracture, right?

501
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,463
And now it's infected.
They gotta cut it off at the knee.

502
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,426
Wasn't so bad, though.
He had no more pain.

503
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,436
He ended up moving to Jersey,
working for the PATH...

504
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,006
...being a motorman.
Got a pension and shit now.

505
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,736
l guess everything happens for a reason,
you know what l mean?

506
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,312
You're a sunny little shit,
l'll give you that much.

507
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,455
Get in here! Get in that door!

508
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,951
Jack!

509
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:53,328
-Pull me in! Help me in!
-Come on, come on, come on.

510
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,589
Lock the door.

511
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,037
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Hold up.

512
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,369
Come on.

513
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,067
-You all right?
-Yeah.

514
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,454
Jack, what are we doing?
Where are we going?

515
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,001
-Come on.
-Where we going, Jack?

516
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,894
Out of the way.

517
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,505
Over here.

518
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:14,507
Jack? How we even know that Centre Dtreet
Courthouse is in this direction, Jack?

519
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,305
Jack? We gotta know--

520
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,182
Down! Head down!

521
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,507
Go!

522
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,513
Come on!

523
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,469
Kaller!

524
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,907
Push it.

525
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,831
You all right, Jack?

526
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,206
l was aiming for the kid,
if that makes you feel better.

527
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,316
Well, you missed!

528
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,416
That kid is gonna get you killed.

529
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,658
He worth that?

530
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,059
Well, l got all day.

531
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,564
How about you, you got all day?

532
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,076
-Jack, you still there?
-Yeah.

533
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,779
Dtill here.

534
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,251
Well, this is awkward.

535
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,716
When l started this day...

536
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:13,192
...l never figured on trading
9 mils with my friend.

537
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:20,165
l think we stopped being friends
right around 8:25, in that bar.

538
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,495
No.

539
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:28,277
No, that's not gonna erase
20 years together.

540
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,877
We're still friends.

541
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,383
Look...

542
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,719
...a lot l'd take back, but l can't.

543
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:44,693
Well, so you move forward.
Next day, next case.

544
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,956
-Lines were crossed.
-What lines?

545
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:53,365
-You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank.
-What lines? There are no lines!

546
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,264
There's getting it done
and not getting it done, period!

547
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,535
You put the bad guys away
no matter what it takes.

548
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,236
Now, you're gonna ruin the lives...

549
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,908
...of six cops.

550
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,679
Good cops.

551
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,649
Good men.

552
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,751
Are you ready to sacrifice
their lives for that kid?

553
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,731
Hey, Frank.

554
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,897
-Frank.
-Yeah?

555
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,401
This is not about me
ruining anybody's life.

556
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,835
Okay? This is about you.

557
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,670
You hear me?

558
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,269
Yeah.

559
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,275
You look at that kid's jacket?

560
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,444
l did.

561
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:45,019
-Armed robbery, assault, beats old women--
-l never had no armed robbery!

562
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,317
Beats old women over the heads,
steals their Docial Decurity checks.

563
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,484
-One time, l used--
-Shutup. Shutup.

564
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,527
Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.

565
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:58,896
No, Jack, listen to him.
No, that kid, he's sharp.

566
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,331
Yeah, he's playing you.

567
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,601
He's sharper than you are.

568
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,435
He's telling you stories, right?

569
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,444
He wants to be a good citizen.

570
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,010
Go to church.

571
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,642
Buy his mother a house.

572
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,687
But he has spent
more than half his life in prison.

573
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:26,958
Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell
for weapons possession.

574
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,929
-He's always gonna do what he has done.
-l wasn't....

575
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,536
He is a career criminal.
That's who you're protecting.

576
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,875
-You all right?
-Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side.

577
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,873
He's got my gun too.

578
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,337
Now, if you can't see
how wrong this is...

579
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,506
...l promise you
l will speak from my heart...

580
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,019
...when l give the eulogy at your funeral.

581
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,883
Do...

582
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,819
...do you believe the kid?

583
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,029
Or do you believe your ex-partner?

584
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,496
Frank, we're right
on the other side of the door.

585
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,435
Because...

586
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,936
...if you believe the kid...

587
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,777
...you got a choice to make.

588
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,124
Do you go through your ex-partner?

589
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,858
Or do you choose door number two...

590
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:38,599
...and go back to where you came,
with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand?

591
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,244
You're not gonna get very far.
And what if your ex-partner is right, Jack?

592
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:55,142
What if he is right, and you're wasting
your whole miserable life?

593
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,567
-lt's Frank.
-You all right?

594
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,402
Yeah. They're in the elevator.
Deal the building.

595
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,975
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, get on that.

596
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,145
Everybody out! Police!

597
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:29,514
Everybody out! Police!
Move, move! Police!

598
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,656
-Frank, where are you?
-Bobby, l'm coming up!

599
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,953
All right. Come on, come on.
Upstairs. Deal the stairwell.

600
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,460
-All right.
-Find the back stairs. Check the roof.

601
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,189
-Come on, Mal! This way.
-Got you.

602
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,732
-Maldonado, seal it up.
-Got you.

603
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,817
Hello? Hello? Hello?

604
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:11,349
-No, nothing.
-No answer. He's not there. Come on.

605
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,870
l never open door.

606
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,270
Please. Please, help.

607
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,975
Come on.

608
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,250
Jack, Jack, Jack. Thank you.

609
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,822
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

610
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:44,450
-You saw that, right? You heard him, right?
-Yeah. He never opens the door.

611
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,806
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

612
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,704
-Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
-Thank you.

613
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,040
-You heard him, right, Jack?
-Not now, Eddie.

614
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,376
-Keep your voice down.
-He said he never opens the door.

615
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,041
You know what that mean, right?

616
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,579
Not right now.
There's the signs everywhere.

617
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:17,693
-Yeah, ADA MacDonald, please.
-May I tell her who's calling?

618
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,295
Yeah, tell her it's the guy
that's got her witness.

619
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,832
You're driving a car
during a hurricane.

620
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,532
Like:

621
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,734
A hurricane.

622
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,972
And there's three people at a bus stop.

623
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,616
-A old woman.
-Yeah.

624
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,776
A friend, like my friend here.

625
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:47,156
Him. He save your life, your friend.

626
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,424
lt's Detective Mosley for you.

627
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,754
-Mosley?
-Yeah?

628
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,726
Where are you?
Where's my witness?

629
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,660
l'm about seven blocks from you.

630
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,164
But there's about a ton of cops
between me and you.

631
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,064
And they all want this kid dead.

632
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,728
Not to mention that
you got a leak in your office.

633
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,000
-Domebody's talking to these cops.
-Dhit.

634
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,838
What did you think was gonna happen
when you pinched Dhue?

635
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:11,480
You thought they'd just lay down
and go away quietly?

636
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,242
We thought if we went to the grand jury,
Dhue would fold.

637
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,646
He bent but didn't break.

638
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,311
We were gonna throw it away until
we ran into Edward Bunker last night.

639
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:23,954
Jury's tenure ends at 1 0. Without that kid,
they'll vote no bill and it all goes away.

640
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,357
He's an eyewitness.
He makes this work.

641
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,260
Where are you? l'll send my squad.
richard, pen.

642
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,781
What room?

643
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:58,389
-Do, what, are they coming?
-Yeah, they're coming.

644
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:03,995
Good. Because l gotta be somewhere, man.
l got something to do.

645
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,398
l gotta be someplace by noon.
l gotta go get something.

646
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,505
lt's real important.

647
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,232
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah.

648
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,508
Ortiz, l'm coming in the building.

649
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,738
Frank?

650
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:24,981
-Touhey and Kaller are taken care of.
-Good. Find Bobby. He's on the back stairs.

651
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,885
Eddie, come here, put this on.
Here, come on, put that on.

652
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,516
But it's a big, hot, wool shirt.
lt's hot. lt's summer.

653
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,323
-You're dressed like a criminal.
-Oh, you want me to--?

654
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,558
You want me to change my--?
l get it. But why can't l put that on?

655
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,326
-What about this?
-What about that?

656
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,768
-What's wrong with this? lt's just a pattern.
-He don't even wear that.

657
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,270
Just put the-- Here.

658
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,200
Never mind. What about this?

659
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,540
ls this all right? Mass-transit blue?

660
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,520
When l was locked up,
they had me work in the kitchen.

661
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,121
Do one day a little dude
walk up to me and say:

662
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,258
''Hey, you think
you could bake me a cake?''

663
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,189
l said, ''Yeah, l'll bake you a cake.''

664
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,421
l ain't tell him l ain't never
baked a cake, you know.

665
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,121
But l ain't got shit else to do.

666
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:13,235
Do, you know, l read the instructions...

667
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,167
...l bake him a cake, you know,
for his daughter's birthday.

668
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,068
She'd come up there to visit him.

669
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,234
You know, it say,
''Happy Birthday, Angel,'' right?

670
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,576
He go crazy.
He can't get enough, you know.

671
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,276
He said, ''Eddie, you done hooked me up.
Man, you the man.''

672
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,944
And l started doing that.
lt was good. l had a skill.

673
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,283
People look at me different.
They would start--

674
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,551
-You missed a button.
-Did l?

675
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,819
Your buttons are all crooked.

676
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,361
-Come on. Come on, man.
-All right.

677
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,860
Nugent.

678
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,467
You're a prince.

679
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:54,305
-The word is 5E, boys, 5E.
-Got it.

680
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,839
Then l start doing my research,
doing my due diligence.

681
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:04,112
l found out, you know, it's good money
in birthday cakes for kids, you know.

682
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:09,721
That type of thing, like Tweety Bird
or Bugs Bunny or something like that.

683
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,952
Or Yu-Gi-Oh!.
You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh!?

684
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:17,022
-Yu-Gi-Oh!.
-Yu-Gi-Oh!. Kids love that, man.

685
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,936
You don't know Yu-Gi-Oh!?
You gotta get out more. Yu-Gi-Oh! hot.

686
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,336
Know what l'm saying?

687
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:35,015
l'm gonna make money, Jack.
Open up my bakery.

688
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:39,178
You gonna eat your words about me, Jack.
How do l look? Do l look all right?

689
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,655
-All right.
-Freeze! Police!

690
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,158
-Police! Police!
-Shutup!

691
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,852
-Oh, my God!
-Shutup!

692
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,324
Frank, they gave us
the wrong apartment.

693
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,028
Put it down.

694
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,374
Put it down.

695
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:05,861
Can't get lucky all the time.

696
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:08,127
You can be smart every day, though.

697
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:14,026
-All right, give me the gun.
-Hold on.

698
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:16,069
What are you doing?

699
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:23,577
This place is crawling with cops, Eddie.

700
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:26,511
Hey, look at me.

701
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,378
Eddie, what are you doing?

702
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:34,156
How does it feel?

703
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:38,994
How does it feel?

704
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:41,487
You're a baker, right?

705
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:45,662
Eddie, listen to him.

706
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:47,960
Pull that trigger,
you go to jail for life.

707
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,338
Frank, we're on our way down.

708
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,074
Frank, do you read me?

709
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:59,942
-You can't stop me, you understand?
-Time to go.

710
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:03,052
-Time to go.
-You can't stop me.

711
00:54:05,255 --> 00:54:07,450
You gave him a loaded weapon?

712
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:13,358
-Frank.
-Bobby, get these things off me.

713
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,124
-Did he take your gun?
-They went south. Get out of here.

714
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:20,599
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece.
Give me a piece! Get over here.

715
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:27,407
Make a hole, make a hole.
Come on, make a hole.

716
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,186
Dpeak to me.
Come on, somebody, speak to me.

717
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:47,963
Turn.

718
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:57,970
-Excuse me!
-Open up!

719
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:01,341
-Excuse me!
-Open up!

720
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:04,204
Keep moving. Go.
Go, go, go.

721
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:07,811
Oh, shit.

722
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,119
On the bus! Let's go.

723
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:20,359
-Just keep driving.
-What are you doing?

724
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,988
-l'm a cop. Lock the back door.
-He's got a gun!

725
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:28,198
No stops.
Tell them to hang on to something, Eddie!

726
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:32,467
Hang on! Don't worry, this man,
he's a police officer.

727
00:55:32,642 --> 00:55:34,667
-Everything is gonna be fine.
-Hang on!

728
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:36,676
Everybody just hang on. Don't worry!

729
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:47,281
right, right, right! Go right!

730
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:54,525
-What are you doing?
-Dtop this thing!

731
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:08,337
Get down!

732
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,040
Get away from the bus!
Away from the bus!

733
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,540
Dtay down! Dtay down!

734
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:50,185
Heads down!

735
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:55,650
-Where the hell are you?
-Construction site at Baxter.

736
00:56:55,825 --> 00:56:57,053
He has hostages.

737
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:02,793
Let me go.

738
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:12,136
Listen!

739
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:15,536
Everybody, stand up.
They're not gonna shoot you.

740
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:18,112
Dtand up in front of the windows.

741
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,715
They won't shoot you.
You, stay down. Dtay down.

742
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:28,483
Fill in the blanks. Fill in the spots.

743
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:30,785
Dcoot over, scoot over! That's it.

744
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,896
-All right, get Gruber down here.
-Okay.

745
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:41,059
Hey!

746
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:43,596
All right, seal off that end.

747
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:59,752
-lt's a busload.
-Jesus, this shit just gets deeper.

748
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:01,584
-Bobby?
-Gruber's on his way.

749
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:05,117
All right. We gotta get
our stories straight, all right?

750
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:06,922
We're getting our stories straight?

751
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:14,599
Yeah, suit up.

752
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:28,816
Thought we could handle this quickly
and quietly, commissioner.

753
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:31,613
A guy shoots a cop,
takes a grand-jury witness hostage...

754
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:33,449
...and we're supposed to make nice?

755
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:37,787
Commissioner, look, sir, this is--
Watch your back, sir.

756
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:39,826
This is my fault, all right?

757
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:43,329
l used to work with Mosley,
so l asked the captain to let me handle it.

758
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,992
l felt that l could bring him in.
l just didn't realize how far gone he was.

759
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,731
-Dtay on Tac 2, boys.
-Wait for command, here we go.

760
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:53,909
That's it, cover them up.

761
00:58:56,346 --> 00:59:00,009
Good, okay. Great job. Thank you.

762
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:10,121
-Commissioner, sir. Captain.
-Hi, Mike.

763
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:13,262
-What do we got?
-Cop. Twenty plus, flipped.

764
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,955
-Duicidal?
-Been to the farm twice the last four years.

765
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:18,100
-Twice?
-Twice. Nothing like this, though.

766
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:21,294
-What do you know, detective?
-Like the captain said, he flipped.

767
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,872
After he nailed Dhue, he started
spouting crap about making headlines.

768
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,271
There's no way
that you're getting this guy out.

You know, it's important
that we're clear with each other, Jack.

ESU and HNT are in place.

The block is sealed, Jack.

l could do that.

824
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:15,566

-Yeah.

And, yeah, every day

That's gonna be the motto for my shop:

''Every day's a birthday,'' you know.

...a court stenographer
and somebody from TV.

841
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:16,795
Somebody that I would recognize.

842
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:19,628
I want them to come on the bus
and record sworn testimony.

843
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:24,034
When l get what l want,
l'll let everybody out. Dafely.

844
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:29,042
-That's a tall order. lt'll take some time--
-Just do it. l'm not in the mood, okay?

845

01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:34,206
...or I'm gonna shoot
these passengers one at a time...

847
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:36,852
-...and throw them out the door.
-Jack, be cool, okay?

848
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,989
Let's not do anything rash.
This thing can end without bloodshed.

849
01:04:40,156 --> 01:04:42,124
-Okay? We can work this--
-Fifteen minutes.

850
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:44,987
Jack? Jack?

851
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:49,961
He's gone.

852
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:53,426
All right, everybody on your feet.

853
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:57,873
-Jack, what are you doing?
-Gotta get these people off this bus.

854
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:01,306
But you just made your call.
You called the DA. They said they'd come.

855
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:03,775
-Everybody's coming.
-Nobody's coming, okay?

856
01:05:03,946 --> 01:05:05,504
What do you mean,
nobody's coming?

857
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:08,912
They're gonna breach this bus
in less than five minutes.

858
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:12,213
-They're gonna kill me, kill you--
-Jack, what about testifying?

859
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:14,686
We're right here. We can go.
We can end this.

860
01:05:14,857 --> 01:05:17,291
-We can testify.
-Nobody's testifying.

861
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:20,387
lt's all over, Eddie.

862
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:22,758
We lose, kid.

863
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:37,541
-Hey, ray.
-Frank.

864
01:05:37,713 --> 01:05:39,305
You...?

865
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,280
You guys going in?

866
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:44,886
The commissioner hasn't given us
the green light yet.

867
01:05:45,054 --> 01:05:51,050
Well, l don't need to remind you
that he shot two of us.

868
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,030
Enough said.

869
01:05:55,498 --> 01:05:58,399
We got maybe 40 civilians on that bus.
Get them out.

870
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:00,661
l don't want anybody hurt,
including our guys.

871
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:03,931
Nobody's gonna get hurt, commissioner.
These guys know what to do.

872
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:13,672
-We have movement.
-Let's move in.

873
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,683
-Hold your fire. Repeat, hold your fire.
-Move in to the bus. Let's go.

874
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:21,452
Hey. What--?

875
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:24,415
Bob.

876
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:28,490
When you get outside--

877
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:30,529
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

878
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,362
They'll take you to a holding area.
lt'll be hectic.

879
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:36,437
-But everybody's out there--
-Listen to me, listen to me.

880
01:06:36,606 --> 01:06:39,166
Once you get outside that perimeter,
you just get lost.

881
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:42,334
-What if they--?
-Keep moving. You just keep moving.

882
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:43,843
Come here. You look great.

883
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,776
Hey, gray suit.

884
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,440
Got you a gray suit.

885
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:51,815
All right? Hands in the air, folks.
Don't look back.

886
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,831
Hands in the air, you'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

887
01:07:15,044 --> 01:07:16,568
Next. Dorry.

888
01:07:26,355 --> 01:07:28,220
Come on, come on, let's go!

889
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:30,222
-What is he doing?
-How should l know?

01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:32,486
-l'll let you know when l know.
-Don't you--

891
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:35,028
l'll let you know when l know.
Out of my face!

892
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:47,506
Kaller, give me a hand with them!

893
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:54,013
Bobby? right there. right here.

894
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:57,246
-That's him. That's him.
-Hey, man!

895
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:00,481
-lt's not him.
-Let him go.

896
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:02,715
-The dude, he changed. lt's not me.
-What?

897
01:08:02,892 --> 01:08:05,554
-He's in a suit, a gray suit.
-Duit, gray suit.

898
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:29,144
-We count 31 .
-That leaves eight people on the bus.

899
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:30,979
No, l was the last one off the bus.

900
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:34,054
The only person left on that bus
is the guy with the gun.

901
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:36,955
-Then go, do it!
-Let's go, let's go.

902
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:40,357
-Get your people out there. Let's go.
-Come on, let's go.

903
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,291
Mosley is still on the bus.
That kid is here somewhere. We checked--

904
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:46,264
Bobby, l don't care what you checked.

905
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:48,995
Check it again, now. Go.
You guys, that way.

906
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:07,778
This is Detective Jack Mosley.

907
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:21,361

913
01:10:27,002 --> 01:10:29,266
Get on your goddamn radio.

-Get away from the bus!

921
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:51,719
Hold your fire.

922
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:56,596
Jack. Jack, it's me. Jack Mosley!

923
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,133
lt's me, Eddie, Jack.

924
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:03,370
Chuck Berry.

925
01:11:03,706 --> 01:11:05,196
Chuck Berry.

926
01:11:05,674 --> 01:11:09,201
Chuck Berry,
he got locked up for armed robbery.

927
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:11,642
He changed. He changed.

928
01:11:13,382 --> 01:11:16,909
Barry White, he stole 300 tires.

929
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:22,217
Can you picture big Barry White
stealing 300 tires? He changed.

930
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:24,757
You said-- You said people don't change.

931
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:27,727
-People change.
-Eddie.

932
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:30,830
-What?
-You're killing me.

933
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,831
Team three, breach the bus.
repeat, team three, breach the bus.

934
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:37,472
Entrance team moving in.

935
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:53,077
Get out of the way!

936
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:56,517
Head down!
Cover your ears and your eyes!

937
01:12:02,097 --> 01:12:03,325
-Hold fire.
-Go, go!

938
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:05,791
-Go, go, go!
-Hold your fire!

939
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:06,992
This is a nightmare.

940
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,217
Hold fire!

941
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,549
-Let's go! Move, move, move!
-Dtay down!

942
01:12:58,721 --> 01:13:00,188
-Move up! Move up!
-Come here.

943
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:03,086
Team two, status?

944
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:06,353
Go ahead! Take it! Go!

945
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:39,223
The bus is empty.

946
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:41,090
They went through the bus doors!

947
01:13:41,263 --> 01:13:44,892
They're in the goddamn building!
Deal it off!

948
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,435
-All clear. The bus is empty.
-They've entered the building.

949
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:52,365
Deal the building, start a search.

950
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:55,009
remember, heads up.
He just shot two cops. Be careful.

951
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:59,246
Jack, l gotta tell you something.

952
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:01,815
Hey, man. Jack, listen to me, man.

953
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:04,043
Jack, l wanna tell you something.

954
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:07,916
Hold on, hold on, wait.
l gotta tell you something. lt's important.

955
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:10,925
Dhit. Get up, go.

956
01:14:13,128 --> 01:14:15,028
Oh, shit.

957
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:18,598
Hey, sir. l'm a cop, all right?
l'm on the job.

958
01:14:18,767 --> 01:14:20,792
Look, l need that phone for a minute.

959
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,562
Look what you did to my suit, man.

960
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:25,733
l told you you was gonna get me shot.

961
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,175
lt's me. l need your help.

962
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:32,707
All this started because my friend
Maurice came by my house.

963
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:37,941
Two days ago,
Maurice came by my house.

964
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,519
He all excited.

965
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:42,282
He got a shoebox.

966
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:43,755
He had a gun.

967
01:14:43,926 --> 01:14:46,486
He talking about,
''Hold this for me for a little while.''

968
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:50,428
l'm like, ''l'm on parole.''
He like, ''Me too.''

969
01:14:50,599 --> 01:14:54,535
Next day, somebody shot him.

970
01:14:55,838 --> 01:14:58,363
Thirty-two thousand dollars
in that shoebox.

971
01:15:00,476 --> 01:15:03,206
-That's a sign, huh?
-Yeah.

972
01:15:03,379 --> 01:15:05,609
lt's a very big sign.

973
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:08,306
Easy, easy, easy.

974
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:16,623
You know how much it gonna take me
to open the bakery?

975
01:15:19,028 --> 01:15:21,553
Thirty-one thousand dollars.

976
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:26,463
Jack, l got so nervous
l ran out the house.

977
01:15:26,635 --> 01:15:31,163
l went to Port Authority
and l put the money in a locker.

978
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:36,506
l get back to my house...

979
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:39,011
...my parole officer's there...

980
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:40,808
...in my house.

981
01:15:40,983 --> 01:15:43,816
He got Maurice's gun in his hand.

982
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:47,251
He looking at me like, ''That's it, Eddie.''

983
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:49,489
And he's talking about 1 5 years, man.

984
01:15:50,059 --> 01:15:52,027
l got so sick.

985
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:55,755
Then the DA came to my cell...

986
01:15:57,232 --> 01:16:00,258
...and he showed me
the picture of that cop.

987
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,601
Then l met you.

988
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:09,042
Jack, they clean them lockers out
every 24 hours.

989
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:12,504
l had a little schedule going, man.

990
01:16:13,882 --> 01:16:16,282
Court at 1 0:00...

991
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:19,583
...Port Authority at 1 2.

992
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,746
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.

993
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:24,525
You ain't gonna die on me, are you?

994
01:16:26,695 --> 01:16:29,357
l don't know, l never died before.

995
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:31,829
lt's not gonna happen today.

996
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,400
Hey. Thank you for coming.

997
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:48,414
-What's going on?
-Look. Dhot here. l think it went in and out.

998
01:16:48,784 --> 01:16:50,615
Yeah, let's get him in.

999
01:16:52,855 --> 01:16:54,288
l know you.

1000
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:56,321
-Come on.
-l was at your house.

1001
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,585
-You were at my apartment?
-Had to get my gun.

1002
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:00,626
Bigmouth.

1003
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:04,563
lt was very nice, very clean.

1004
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:08,102
The police grilled me
for an hour at the hospital.

1005
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,498
What'd you say to them?

1006
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:12,071
That you're a self-medicating,
depressed individual.

1007
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:14,402
And you don't care
about anything or anyone.

1008
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:19,070
Oh, she's honest, straightforward.
That's sexy. l like that.

1009
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:30,181
What'd you do this time, Jack?

1010
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,123
He saved my life a couple times.

1011
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:39,298
Hey, he's a good dude.
You gotta give him another chance.

1012
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:42,403
l don't know what he did,
but you gotta give him another chance.

1013
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:45,005
He gotta have somebody to talk to.

1014
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:47,699
l'm not gonna be around.

1015
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:53,206
-Eddie, this is my sister, Diane.
-What?

1016
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:55,942
She's your sister?

1017
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:58,349
Oh, man.

1018
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,217
l just started having a little hope for you.
Your family don't even like you.

1019
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:05,053
l got a sister too.

1020
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:08,858
But she live in Deattle.

1021
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:11,465
l was supposed to go out there
and start my bakery.

1022
01:18:11,633 --> 01:18:14,158
l was supposed to go out there today
to see her.

1023
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:16,327
Dee her on the bus.

1024
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,300
l can stop the bleeding...

1025
01:18:18,473 --> 01:18:20,964
...but he's gotta get stitched up,
get to a hospital.

1026
01:18:21,476 --> 01:18:23,569
We gotta be at the courthouse
in less than 20.

1027
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,240
You're gonna have to do it.

1028
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:32,481
You're gonna be fine, Eddie.
lt's not as bad as it looks.

1029
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:36,519
What happened to your hand?

1030
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,251
l gotta ask you one more favor.

1031
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:44,689
Just a little favor.

1032
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:53,871
Hey, is today really your birthday?

1033
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,703
No.

1034
01:18:55,878 --> 01:19:00,474
No, l just said that because the little girl,
she was so scared.

1035
01:19:01,183 --> 01:19:03,378
She was cute, man.

1036
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:06,220
When's your birthday?

1037
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,590
-l don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

1038
01:19:13,562 --> 01:19:16,258
No, for real, l don't know.

1039
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:20,367
l'm not-- l came up in foster care.
Had a lot of birthdays.

1040
01:19:20,535 --> 01:19:25,370
But didn't you say--? You got a sister, right?
That you're going to see?

1041
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:28,532
Yeah, l just found out about her
a couple months ago.

1042
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,769
-Never met your sister?
-No.

1043
01:19:32,347 --> 01:19:35,180
That's why l'm going out to Deattle
to meet her.

1044
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:37,582
l'm looking forward.

1045
01:19:37,753 --> 01:19:40,551
Maybe she turns out
to look like Angelina Jolie.

1046
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:43,987
Dhit, if she do,
l hope she ain't my sister.

1047
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:50,661
Hey, man, what you want
on your cake, man?

1048
01:19:50,832 --> 01:19:52,993
You never told me.

1049
01:19:54,136 --> 01:19:57,003
-l don't want no cake, Eddie.
-Damn it, Jack, come on, man--

1050
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:59,766
l can't think of anything
that has happened in my life...

1051
01:19:59,942 --> 01:20:03,002
-...that l would want written on a cake.
-Nothing?

1052
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:07,081
l'm not a good guy, Eddie.

1053
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,414
l'm not a good guy.

1054
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,091
Yeah, me neither.

1055
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:35,938
-Diane.
-Frank.

1056
01:20:36,111 --> 01:20:37,908
Give me the keys.

1057
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,913
-Dtay in the car.
-Little out of your sector, aren't you?

1058
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,710
Daving lives knows no bounds.

1059
01:20:42,884 --> 01:20:45,375
-You should know that, Frank.
-You look good.

1060
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:47,784
You look a little desperate.
Doesn't suit you.

1061
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:49,423
Open the door.

1062
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:51,821
Open the door. Open the door.

1063
01:20:53,261 --> 01:20:55,729
Sorry, Jack, this is as close
as l can get you.

1064
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:04,464
Like l said, you're looking good.

1065
01:21:09,144 --> 01:21:10,702
Thanks, kid.

1066
01:21:11,813 --> 01:21:13,178
All right, come on, let's go.

1067
01:21:13,348 --> 01:21:15,816
No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.

1068
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:17,383
Why is that? Hold on for what?

1069
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:19,452
This is as far as you go too.

1070
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:21,748
-Come on, man. l don't--
-Listen to me, Eddie.

1071
01:21:21,923 --> 01:21:24,357
-What?
-Listen.

1072
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:28,457
Those guys you were gonna
testify against...

1073
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,689
-...those cops?
-Yeah?

1074
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,566
l was one of them.

1075
01:21:42,044 --> 01:21:44,444
You were gonna testify against me too.

1076
01:21:47,082 --> 01:21:49,175
l did what they did.

1077
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:51,819
We did some bad things.

1078
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:56,185
l did another bad thing when l used you.

1079
01:21:57,426 --> 01:22:01,624
l was gonna let you do
what l should have done.

1080
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:04,823
What l should have had the courage
to do six years ago.

1081
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:11,637
l'm sorry.

1082
01:22:16,778 --> 01:22:21,010
You know, if you didn't
come to get me today...

1083
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,484
...l'd be dead right now.

1084
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:26,450
-right.
-So....

1085
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:30,517
l was supposed to meet you.

1086
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:33,356
That was the sign.

1087
01:22:33,762 --> 01:22:35,992
You saved my life, kid.

1088
01:22:40,902 --> 01:22:43,427
Take care of yourself, kid.

1089
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,568
Thank you.

1090
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:50,272
Make cakes, Eddie the baker.

1091
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:01,786
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys
to your best friend.

1092
01:23:01,957 --> 01:23:04,653
You let him take the old lady
to the hospital.

1093
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:09,695
You stay at the bus stop with the girl
because she's the girl of your dreams, right?

1094
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:12,265
So everything's gonna be okay.

1095
01:23:13,168 --> 01:23:15,136
-right?
-Yeah.

1096
01:23:16,404 --> 01:23:18,634
Have fun in Deattle. Day hi to your sister.

1097
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:20,399
Yeah.

1098
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:26,136
Yeah.

1099
01:23:27,449 --> 01:23:30,247
Get him to the Port Authority.
Make sure he gets on that bus.

1100
01:23:30,418 --> 01:23:31,646
-Carl, thanks.
-No problem.

1101
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,219
All right.

1102
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,455
Hell of a morning, huh?

1103
01:24:57,539 --> 01:24:58,801
Where's the wit?

1104
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:02,473
You're looking at him.

1105
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:08,413
l let the kid go, Frank.

1106
01:25:09,784 --> 01:25:13,743
-You're not gonna get to him now.
-Bullshit.

1107
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:16,719
Wouldn't do that.

1108
01:25:26,468 --> 01:25:28,095
So...

1109
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:31,929
...what do you think
you're gonna tell them?

1110
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:35,334
Are you gonna tell them everything?

1111
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,172
Are you gonna tell them about you too?

1112
01:25:39,748 --> 01:25:41,909
You think that's gonna
make you feel better?

1113
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:44,046
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

1114
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:45,948
Then why?

1115
01:25:47,222 --> 01:25:49,247
Look, Jack, you and me...

1116
01:25:49,424 --> 01:25:54,418
...we did our business in a certain way.

1117
01:25:56,631 --> 01:26:00,158
You never complained
when we cleared the tough cases.

1118
01:26:00,335 --> 01:26:04,101
lt didn't bother you
doing any of that until....

1119
01:26:05,473 --> 01:26:08,203
Listen to me, all right? You listen.

1120
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:11,277
Okay, Jack? really listen.

1121
01:26:11,446 --> 01:26:14,347
Whatever you think
that you are gonna do up there...

1122
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,047
...it is never gonna happen.

1123
01:26:18,019 --> 01:26:20,579
You are not gonna make it.

1124
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:24,658
ls that what you're thinking, Frank?

1125
01:26:25,193 --> 01:26:29,357
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

1126
01:26:31,032 --> 01:26:33,626
Like the Ling family, huh?

1127
01:26:33,802 --> 01:26:35,030
Like they never knew.

1128
01:26:35,203 --> 01:26:37,797
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1129
01:26:37,972 --> 01:26:40,497
All right, so l stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

1130
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:44,008
-He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
-So what?

1131
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:47,376
Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...

1132
01:26:47,549 --> 01:26:50,712
...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, ''Good job.''

1133
01:26:50,885 --> 01:26:53,615
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

1134
01:26:53,788 --> 01:26:57,349
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1135
01:26:57,525 --> 01:27:00,460
-He was gonna take down our case.
-He was an innocent man.

1136
01:27:00,628 --> 01:27:03,995
-He was gonna take down our case.
-He was somebody's husband.

1137
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:06,929
-He was gonna take down our case.
-He was somebody's father.

1138
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:09,900
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

1139
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,404
-He wanted to tell the truth.
-Fuck the truth!

1140
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:25,685
right.

1141
01:27:44,739 --> 01:27:47,435
l'm not gonna need this anymore.

1142
01:28:32,068 --> 01:28:34,036
Bobby? He's on his way up.

1143
01:28:34,904 --> 01:28:35,893
Take him out.

1144
01:29:09,339 --> 01:29:12,137
Mosley's in the building!
Get the ADA. Freeze!

1145
01:29:12,308 --> 01:29:14,242
-Hands in the air!
-Don't shoot.

1146
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:16,571
-Don't move! Down on your knees.
-l'm not armed.

1147
01:29:16,746 --> 01:29:19,476
-Down on your knees! Now!
-Don't shoot, l'm not armed.

1148
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:23,278
Lower your weapon. Just call
ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.

1149
01:29:23,453 --> 01:29:25,785
-Hands up.
-Get ADA MacDonald here right now!

1150
01:29:25,955 --> 01:29:28,253
-Don't shoot. Don't shoot me.
-Get your hands up!

1151
01:29:28,424 --> 01:29:30,187
Just get ADA MacDonald for me.

1152
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:33,158
-Jack, come on!
-l won't argue with you. Get down.

1153
01:29:33,329 --> 01:29:35,126
Mosley! Mosley!

1154
01:29:35,298 --> 01:29:36,560
Hands up!

1155
01:29:36,733 --> 01:29:38,997
Where's my witness?
Where's Edward Bunker?

1156
01:29:39,602 --> 01:29:41,467
He didn't make it.

1157
01:29:42,305 --> 01:29:43,829
l'm gonna take his place.

1158
01:29:49,445 --> 01:29:52,380
-Please lower your weapons.
-Hold your fire and stand down.

1159
01:29:52,548 --> 01:29:54,175
Back off.

1160
01:29:56,352 --> 01:29:58,479
l have information...

1161
01:29:58,654 --> 01:30:01,885
...regarding your ongoing
witness-tampering investigation.

1162
01:30:02,759 --> 01:30:05,523
Dates, cases that include extortion...

1163
01:30:06,095 --> 01:30:09,121
...manslaughter and possible homicide...

1164
01:30:09,932 --> 01:30:12,799
...involving members
of the 1 4th Precinct.

1165
01:30:13,903 --> 01:30:17,361
These charges include
Captain Dan Gruber...

1166
01:30:17,707 --> 01:30:19,868
...detectives Jerry Dhue...

1167
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:22,544
...Edward Maldonado...

1168
01:30:23,312 --> 01:30:25,542
...Bob Torres...

1169
01:30:25,715 --> 01:30:27,615
...Jim Mulvey...

1170
01:30:28,918 --> 01:30:30,579
...myself...

1171
01:30:31,654 --> 01:30:33,383
...and Detective Frank Nugent.

1172
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,090
What's this about, Mosley?
What do you want?

1173
01:30:40,863 --> 01:30:42,888
l want Edward Bunker's record expunged.

1174
01:30:43,099 --> 01:30:46,330
-Done. What else?
-Nothing else.

1175
01:30:46,502 --> 01:30:48,265
You can substantiate all this, Mosley?

1176
01:30:49,872 --> 01:30:51,339
Yeah.

1177
01:30:52,341 --> 01:30:53,433
Gun!

1178
01:30:59,682 --> 01:31:02,207
Hold your fire. l fired that shot.

1179
01:31:08,024 --> 01:31:11,687
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

1180
01:31:13,796 --> 01:31:15,423
Like the Ling family, huh?

1181
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:18,594
Like they never knew.

1182
01:31:18,768 --> 01:31:21,362
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1183
01:31:21,537 --> 01:31:23,971
All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

1184
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:27,166
-He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
-So what?

1185
01:31:27,343 --> 01:31:29,436
-So what?
-So how about he was innocent?

1186
01:31:29,612 --> 01:31:32,046
-Innocent?
-How about he didn't deserve to die?

1187
01:31:32,215 --> 01:31:35,707
Look, if it hadn't happened
the way that it did, if he hadn't died...

1188
01:31:35,885 --> 01:31:38,820
...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, ""Good job. ""

1189
01:31:38,988 --> 01:31:41,786
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

1190
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:45,519
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1191
01:31:45,695 --> 01:31:48,357
-He was gonna take down our case.
-He was an innocent man.

1192
01:31:48,531 --> 01:31:51,762
-He was gonna take down our case.
-He was somebody's husband.

1193
01:31:51,934 --> 01:31:54,698
-He was gonna take down our case.
-He was somebody's father.

1194
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:57,669
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

1195
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,832
-He wanted to tell the truth.
-Fuck the truth!

1196
01:32:04,547 --> 01:32:06,708
Let's get you to the jury.

1197
01:32:21,797 --> 01:32:22,821
-Thanks a lot.
-Thanks.

1198
01:32:22,999 --> 01:32:24,261
Okay.

1199
01:32:41,183 --> 01:32:43,549
-Hey, happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, Jack.

1200
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:45,812
Welcome back, Jack.

1201
01:32:45,988 --> 01:32:48,513
-Are you kidding me?
-Two years in the pen is enough.

1202
01:32:48,691 --> 01:32:50,625
Thanks for that memory. Thank you.

1203
01:32:50,793 --> 01:32:52,624
-Happy birthday, Jack.
-Happy birthday.

1204
01:32:52,795 --> 01:32:55,161
-Happy birthday. Blow them out.
-Welcome home.

1205
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:57,891
l hate birthdays, you know that, right?

1206
01:32:59,835 --> 01:33:02,497
-Sorry, sorry.
-Happy birthday.

1207
01:33:12,481 --> 01:33:14,278
This came with it.

1208
01:33:25,861 --> 01:33:27,852
Dear Jack Mosley:

1209
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:32,626
I hope you're doing well and everything
worked out like it was supposed to.

1210
01:33:32,802 --> 01:33:34,827
I'm doing great.

1211
01:33:35,004 --> 01:33:36,995
Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.

1212
01:33:37,173 --> 01:33:41,542
I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air
before I got here. It's a trip.

1213
01:33:41,711 --> 01:33:45,169
Sometimes I can't believe it.
It's the best feeling I've had in my life.

1214
01:33:45,848 --> 01:33:47,748
I'm busting my ass,
but I'm happy, though.

1215
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,711
The bakery is now open. Three cheers.

1216
01:33:55,524 --> 01:33:58,220
I put my name first
because I'm doing all the hard work.

1217
01:33:58,394 --> 01:34:00,453
These ovens are hot, man.

1218
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:02,996
Hope you like the cake.
What did I tell you?

1219
01:34:03,165 --> 01:34:07,499
-That's Eddie.
-If you're ever in town, you got a friend.

1220
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:10,696
Thank you for doing the right thing,
Jack Mosley. God bless you.

1221
01:34:11,207 --> 01:34:14,938
Keep in touch. Peace.

1222
01:34:15,111 --> 01:34:17,341
-That's great.
-Go on, take one more. Look.

1223
01:34:17,513 --> 01:34:21,916
You know how this guy--?
l was talking, take one more.

1224
01:34:23,552 --> 01:34:25,782
Happy birthday, Jack.

1225
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,611
