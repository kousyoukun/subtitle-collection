1
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:43,235
This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.

2
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:46,470
I guess this will be
my last will and testament.

3
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:48,611
This is for Diane.

4
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:53,445
When this day is over, they're gonna come
and talk to you about this...

5
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:57,639
...and they're gonna... They're gonna
tell you what happened, Diane.

6
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:00,772
But what they tell you
is not really what happened here.

7
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,788
So I hope that you get this.

8
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:09,347
I was trying to do a good thing.

9
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,282
Police! Get down! Everybody, down!

10
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,493
Down! Get down!

11
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:34,536
Go, go, go! Come on!

12
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,774
- Clear.
- Police. Get down.

13
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,250
Seal it off.

14
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:41,130
Agent 10-10, we're all secure.

15
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:43,554
All right, we're out of here.

16
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,154
It's clear.

17
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:48,357
You smell that?

18
00:01:57,197 --> 00:02:00,230
Couple hours. We gotta move now.
Would you turn that thing off?

19
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:02,568
All right, who's downstairs
we don't need?

20
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,572
It's all yours. Good luck.

21
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,373
I hate to do this, Jack, but I need you
to sit on this until uniforms get here.

22
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,777
- All right.
- Just hang until you're relieved.

23
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,370
All right.

24
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,771
Don't touch anything.

25
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:40,712
Any word on the suspects?

26
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,654
- What do you want me to tell you?
- What did you tell them?

27
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,828
I saw someone out there.

28
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,846
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

29
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:05,574
- Anything for me?
- Breath mints.

30
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,483
Sergeant Cannova called.
Wants you to write up this wire request.

31
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,979
Said to make sure
you get the right dates on them.

32
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,588
The particulars are on your desk,
and he needs it by tonight.

33
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,501
All right.

34
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,878
All right, well, we can have an officer
come by about 8 a.m. Tomorrow.

35
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,303
You gave her two?

36
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,478
Well, you know, we do what we can.

37
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:51,843
Hey, Jack, I forgot to tell you,
the lieutenant's looking for you.

38
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:53,900
He wants you to find him right away.

39
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:56,421
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,176
Well, listen.
All right, well, I'll call you.

41
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,676
Hey, Mosley.

42
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,362
- Mosley.
- Yeah.

43
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,387
Grace tell you to find me?

44
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:13,356
- Yeah, just a minute ago.
- All right, need a favor.

45
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:16,036
Get this guy from lockup
and run him to Centre Street.

46
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:19,783
The DA needs him ASAP. He's gotta be
in front of a grand jury before 10.

47
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:22,437
I signed out.

48
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,262
You signed the sheet?

49
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,815
Well, not technically, no.
But I mean, I'm signed out.

50
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,507
Then consider yourself on overtime.

51
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,881
Captain Gruber called.
We need this thing done.

52
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,117
Don't you got some mutt
that takes care of this?

53
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,862
I got Keenan, but he's still on the Verrazano.
He's behind some overturned truck.

54
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,798
I'm tired. I mean, look, normally,
you know me, I don't say no.

55
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,874
I know you been
working all night, Jack...

56
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:50,532
...but who's the detective
and who's the lieutenant here?

57
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:52,872
I mean, Jack, I got nobody else.

58
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,891
It's a nothing thing.

59
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:58,369
One hundred and eighteen minutes
to get a little hemorrhoid 16 blocks.

60
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,210
I'll let you come in
to work late tomorrow.

61
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,995
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:34,403
Edward Bunker.

63
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:36,961
Yeah, that's me, officer.
Eddie Bunker, right here.

64
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,245
Down here, the last cell.

65
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,965
- Come back in an hour.
- What do you mean, come back?

66
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,172
He's supposed to wear a suit
when he leaves.

67
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,545
- And?
- It's not here yet.

68
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:48,010
Just get him out here, all right?

69
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,831
They said he'd wear a suit.

70
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:53,739
No, yeah, I'm supposed to get a suit.
It's a three-piece suit. It's gray.

71
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,242
It's got... Wait. Yeah.

72
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:58,274
It's a three-button, it's gray,
it's got cuffs on the pants.

73
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:01,162
They brought the catalog down.
I picked it out of the catalog.

74
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,212
I'm not supposed
to leave without it. Wait.

75
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,380
I'm not supposed to leave
without that suit.

76
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:09,061
- You tell it to him.
- No, that's why you brought my shoelaces.

77
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,952
- Come on, come on.
- I'm not supposed to.

78
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:13,964
- Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right?
- Yeah, you sure?

79
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:16,361
The old lady goes into the car,
otherwise she dies.

80
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:17,702
- You think so?
- Yeah, man.

81
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:21,480
That's what... I don't know. You gotta
figure out the answer for yourself.

82
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:25,158
Everybody just calm down.
Officer, I'm going to court.

83
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:26,885
- I'm supposed to have a suit.
- Hey.

84
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,158
Shut up. Here's your property.

85
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,496
- It's not a good sign.
- Hands behind your back.

86
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,733
- Hold on, I'm trying...
- Hands behind your back.

87
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,959
I don't even have my...
All my prop... Wait one minute.

88
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,963
It's not right.
They promised me the suit.

89
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,172
I picked it out of the catalog...
Wait, my book.

90
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,308
I can't leave without my book.
My book is very important to me.

91
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:49,382
Why are we rushing like this?
It's not a good sign.

92
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,490
- Hey.
- What's the damn answer?

93
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:53,930
- Hey!
- Shut up.

94
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:57,418
- I hate police.
- Half a tank.

95
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:03,940
You could have had
a little more patience.

96
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,337
This suit don't mean nothing to you.
You probably got a bunch of suits.

97
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,086
But it's a whole different thing to me.

98
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:23,813
These cars don't ever change, huh?

99
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,913
Traditional cruisers.

100
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:29,931
And the same retarded hump
in the middle.

101
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,213
Smell the same way,
like Lysol and vomit.

102
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,345
I hope nobody vomited back here.
They probably did.

103
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:48,327
Hey, man, let me ask you something.

104
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,687
I'm trying to figure this out.

105
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:54,759
You driving along
in your hurricane, right?

106
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:57,193
There's three people at the bus stop.

107
00:08:57,356 --> 00:09:00,258
Yeah, one is an old lady.
She's sick, she about to die.

108
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,876
The second one is your best friend.

109
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,084
He saved your life, right?

110
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:09,481
And the third is the girl of your dreams.

111
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:11,554
Right, but check it out...

112
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:15,842
...you only got space in the car
for one person.

113
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,923
Right? Who you take?

114
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:22,150
It's a riddle that's supposed to tell
what type of person you are...

115
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:23,843
...like where you at in your life.

116
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,468
It's a hypothetical question, man, damn.

117
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:28,873
It's just a hypothetical...

118
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,516
Well, good. Fine, good.
I guess that's my answer.

119
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,013
Why don't you get
on the loudspeaker?

120
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,930
Put the Hawaii Five-0 light on
or something.

121
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:49,092
Use your police power.
Put on a little siren.

122
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,984
Make room, make a hole.

123
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,898
Isn't that the saying,
"Make a hole, make a hole"?

124
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:57,057
Go on, make a hole.

125
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:05,544
Signs. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs.
All over, man.

126
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,101
I used to not even see
nothing like that, man.

127
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:12,524
And then I start seeing them.
And I start looking for them.

128
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:15,015
And everything just start falling in place.

129
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,042
I'm gonna be all right,
where I'm supposed to be.

130
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:24,070
I ain't got my suit,
but once they get my testimony...

131
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:26,506
...they drop my charges, I'm free.

132
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,043
It's making sense to me.

133
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:30,280
I believe in that.

134
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:32,037
Being in the right place.

135
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:34,921
Being where you supposed to be.
You believe in that?

136
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,954
I believe life's too long
and guys like you make it even longer.

137
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:42,091
Life's too long?

138
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:44,999
Damn.

139
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:49,894
That's some cold shit, man. I ain't never
heard nobody say no shit like that.

140
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:54,021
Usually you hear about people
trying to make their life longer, you know?

141
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:57,603
Trying to stay alive a little longer.
You sound a little...

142
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,976
...depressed or something, you all right?

143
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,217
You stopping?

144
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,876
This ain't the courthouse, man.
What you doing?

145
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,978
Yo.

146
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,443
Yo, why you stopping?

147
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:16,809
You gonna rush me out to court,
and now you stopping? What are you...?

148
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:19,045
Hey. Hey, man.

149
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:23,817
Hey, man. Listen, man, I got an important
appointment after my court date, man.

150
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:27,592
That shit ain't funny, man.
Come on, man. It's not a game, man.

151
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,251
Yo.

152
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:32,002
Some bullshit, man.

153
00:11:32,716 --> 00:11:35,814
Hey. Hey!

154
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,395
No, man. It ain't Miller Time, man.

155
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:47,301
The weather will be clear early morning,
but the rest of the day...

156
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,290
Sam. Hey, Angela.

157
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:52,715
So we are looking at a hot, humid day.

158
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:55,047
Looks like temperature
might reach 100 degrees...

159
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:57,034
...so don't forget
to pack your sunscreen.

160
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:58,822
Add a pack of these, will you?

161
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:02,370
I know this dude smelled funny.
I got the wrong dude, man.

162
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,384
17.50. What?

163
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,712
Hey, don't open it. Come over here.

164
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,464
What time is it, man?

165
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,319
It's 8:11.

166
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,566
That's a good sign. That's a good sign.

167
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,456
I'm on my way. I'm gonna get there.

168
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:25,509
- Want change?
- No, you keep the change.

169
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:28,065
Keep the change.
All right, you have a good day.

170
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:30,440
- I don't want the peanuts.
- Bye.

171
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:32,932
No, man. Can't do nothing for you,
understand?

172
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,515
Hey, you better give me that change.
I'm gonna need that.

173
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:38,178
You see my situation right here?

174
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:39,657
No, no, no! No, no, no!

175
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:16,392
Hey!

176
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:59,467
How am I supposed to get out?

177
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,337
- Come on.
- Help me. Help me.

178
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:10,827
- My book. Why did you stop?
- Go, left, go. Left.

179
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:13,738
Move. Move. Move.

180
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,453
Wait. Freeze!

181
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,792
In here. Come on.

182
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:24,770
Shit.

183
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:26,816
Hey!

184
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:29,922
Just get out of here, now!
Go on. Go!

185
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,924
Come on, let's go.
That way, let's go. Go, go.

186
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,173
Ready? Here.

187
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,114
Let's go. Go.

188
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,372
- Dominic, get people out of here, right now.
- Jesus, Jackie. What's going on?

189
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,744
- Everybody. You too.
- All right, okay.

190
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,395
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

191
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,910
Hey, yo.

192
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,798
Come on, keep going. Come on.
Come on, move it.

193
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:15,243
Yeah, this is Detective Jack Mosley,
shield number 227.

194
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:18,535
I am 10-13, at... Hold on a minute.

195
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,530
- Dominic, what's the address here?
- 133 Mulberry.

196
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,522
133 Mulberry.

197
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:28,130
Mulberry Street.

198
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,081
All right.

199
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,094
Is they coming?

200
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,390
I don't know why you stopped, man.

201
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:51,560
I don't know why
you would do that, man.

202
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,365
They said you were nobody.

203
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,150
- I ain't nobody.
- Shut up.

204
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:01,164
You a wino. You need to stop drinking,
that's what you need.

205
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:04,357
Shut up.

206
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:16,330
Jack?

207
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:20,040
- Frank.
- Hey.

208
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:21,989
You all right?

209
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,609
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

210
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,422
We were on Mott when the call went out.
Heard it was you.

211
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:30,600
Got here as soon as we could.

212
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,489
Oh, hi.

213
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,083
- Hey.
- You all right?

214
00:16:39,244 --> 00:16:41,611
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- You having fun?

215
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,610
- No.
- No? Oh, well.

216
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,856
Gotta have fun.

217
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:54,249
- What's up, Jack?
- Hey, man. Hi.

218
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:59,334
You did a really great, great job, man.

219
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,605
You got yourself a bad guy.

220
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:04,995
Been a while, huh? Yeah.

221
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:10,118
We got the second shooter
half a block from here, so it's done.

222
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,569
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

223
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:18,048
I'm just getting my wind. I was running.

224
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,491
Why don't you let us take it from here.

225
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,856
Oh, yeah.

226
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,395
We'll get the kid where he belongs,
and you don't have to worry about a thing.

227
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,697
- We'll get you home.
- Yes, please.

228
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:32,323
Please, please, officer.
That's a very good idea...

229
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:35,307
...because, honestly, I don't think
this dude is doing too good.

230
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:36,646
I told him not to stop.

231
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:39,200
I asked him not to stop.
He just had to stop.

232
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,958
That's when everything happened.
Dude came to the window.

233
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:44,513
I have a very important
appointment aft...

234
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:46,059
Jack.

235
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:48,329
Hey, Shue.

236
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:58,593
Come on. Here.

237
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:00,225
Why don't you take this. Come on.

238
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,884
We'll get you out of here.
Got a car waiting. All right?

239
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,426
Get some sleep.

240
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,217
Jack?

241
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:42,248
The kid was gonna testify against Jerry.

242
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:46,245
He saw Jerry doing some business.

243
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:51,078
Now, we both know that Jerry has never
been a standup guy like you and me.

244
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:56,833
He'll roll over, they indict him.
We can't have that.

245
00:18:57,004 --> 00:19:00,451
No. It's gonna hurt a lot of us.

246
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,649
Come on.

247
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:18,565
See, this whole thing caught us...
It caught us completely unaware.

248
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:24,391
It was supposed to be
Teach's nephew driving him.

249
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:27,938
But he got stuck out there in traffic,
who knows where...

250
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,977
...so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.

251
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,962
You know, just the wrong time
and the wrong place for you today.

252
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:43,463
All right. Now, you know that I would never
put you in a position like this, right?

253
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,569
You know that, huh?

254
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,642
And I never figured
you'd cap one of those guys.

255
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,231
- That's what I get for hiring drug addicts.
- Grab the gun.

256
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:58,051
Grab the gun. There you go.

257
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,452
Come on. Frank?

258
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:04,517
- Here we go.
- All right, here we go. Jack.

259
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,889
Squeeze the trigger.

260
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:14,503
All right. Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

261
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,817
I figure it like this.

262
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,645
You... You pop the guys
trying to spring the kid.

263
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:27,462
The kid, well, he gets your gun.

264
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:30,145
And he takes you hostage.

265
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:33,610
So we came in and saved the day.

266
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,975
He died, you lived.

267
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,259
Now, this could be a good thing
for you, Jack.

268
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,646
Get you back where you belong.

269
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,012
- Are you still with...?
- Stand up.

270
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:57,481
- You still with what's-her-name?
- Come on, stand up.

271
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:00,800
- What are you waiting for?
- What's her name?

272
00:21:16,684 --> 00:21:18,342
Caroline.

273
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:21,095
It's Caroline.

274
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,122
This changes everything, Jack.

275
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:29,760
Over here.

276
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:36,068
Come on, Frank.

277
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:44,267
Kid, get up. Come on.

278
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,880
Shit. Man, shit.

279
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:59,617
All right, Jack, it's 8:25.

280
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:04,324
- You stay there.
- Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10.

281
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:08,038
All right? The kid gets there
one minute past, all this...

282
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:12,870
...it doesn't matter.

283
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:16,649
And all you gotta do
is look the other way.

284
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,667
All right? We still got options here.

285
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:20,072
Okay?

286
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:21,413
We just want the kid.

287
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:26,854
Jack, Jack, Jack,
just let me help you.

288
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:28,484
All right?

289
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:30,212
Back up.

290
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:36,224
Jack, once you go out that door...

291
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,280
...I can't help you.

292
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:41,444
Please just back up, Frank.
Just back up.

293
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,242
He shot a cop.

294
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,995
What the hell did you see?
What did you see?

295
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,855
That cop back there.

296
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,580
I seen him around my way...

297
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:11,650
...holding a gun in this
little Puerto Rican kid's mouth.

298
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,543
Come on. Let's go.

299
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,675
He said he'd kill his mother
if he testified.

300
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:19,651
What you doing that for?
We need that.

301
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,984
The shell in that gun was over 20 years old.
Lucky it went off at all.

302
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:26,082
- They didn't tell you Shue was a cop?
- No, they didn't tell me.

303
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,258
They showed me a picture, that was it.

304
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:32,322
Well, congratulations, because you're about
to testify against one of New York's worst.

305
00:23:32,492 --> 00:23:34,379
- What?
- Fellas, look, the clock's ticking.

306
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,539
He's gotta be at the courthouse by 10.
We know where he's going.

307
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,977
Mulvey, you're coming with me.

308
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,499
- Know where you're going?
- Take the north side.

309
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,227
- You got it, let's go.
- Come on.

310
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:48,136
- Captain.
- Where are we, Frank?

311
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,983
Well, we're putting descriptions out
over precinct channels.

312
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:55,785
No names, or that one's a cop.
It'll help to have some eyes.

313
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,725
- How long can you sit on this?
- He shot a cop.

314
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,049
You're the precinct captain, Dan.
How long?

315
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,155
I don't know.
Hour, maybe a little more.

316
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,300
- Who's on this with you?
- My guys.

317
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:11,494
Ortiz and Maldonado from the 66.
Touhey and Kaller from the 111.

318
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,602
A couple others
you don't wanna know about.

319
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:19,972
The guy was your partner for 20 years.

320
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,376
What the hell happened in there?

321
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,710
- Is he drunk?
- I don't know.

322
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,235
I don't know. We woke him up.

323
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,884
Hopefully he'll do what he always does,
and we can go back to work.

324
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,840
If he doesn't?

325
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:39,561
We gotta quash this thing
before he gets his legs back.

326
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,242
These are his streets.

327
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:48,934
This could get ugly for all of us
if that kid talks.

328
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,336
- He can't talk.
- He won't talk.

329
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,186
Look, I appreciate
what you did for me back there...

330
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:56,901
...but I'm starting to think
you're not the dude for this.

331
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,588
I mean, you're out of breath,
you're hung-over.

332
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:01,927
Your leg is gonna give out on you
any second, man.

333
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:05,256
I got someplace I need to be at 12,
you understand?

334
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,242
I need to be finished at court by 10...

335
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:09,705
...or I'm not gonna get
where I'm supposed to get.

336
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:12,617
- You understand what I'm saying?
- All right, I understand.

337
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:16,075
- You're not listening to what I'm saying.
- Wait, come here. Come here.

338
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,016
Come on.

339
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,320
Hung-over.

340
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,207
A bad leg.

341
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:29,095
No gun.

342
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:34,245
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

343
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:37,128
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm already there.

344
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:02,536
Oh, God.

345
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:07,975
Come on, let's go.

346
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:12,646
Listen, just stay put right here.
I'll be right back.

347
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:17,926
Come on, man, don't take long.
We gotta go.

348
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:21,858
Hurry up.

349
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,642
- Hey, man, where your bathroom?
- What?

350
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:27,592
Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at?

351
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,860
Down at the end of the hall.

352
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,626
Yeah.

353
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:36,546
That's what you look like
when you smile, huh?

354
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:39,527
You was probably drinking then too.

355
00:26:43,211 --> 00:26:45,098
There's the lady.

356
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:48,737
Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.

357
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,038
Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping
to get high or nothing like that.

358
00:26:52,203 --> 00:26:53,992
Man, we gotta go.

359
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,889
Make sure you lift the seat up
before you go.

360
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:03,846
It's up already.

361
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,644
Maybe you left it like that, huh?

362
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:49,314
I'm coming.

363
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:05,990
Hey, Jack.

364
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:08,518
Jack Mosley.

365
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:13,478
Why did you do that?

366
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:16,416
Do what?

367
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,762
Shoot that cop.

368
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,921
Cops...

369
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:23,681
...they don't shoot other cops.

370
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,808
Especially over nobody like me.

371
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:42,914
It's a long way to go for a stranger,
you know.

372
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,050
Thank you.

373
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:48,935
I never had nobody...

374
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,855
Hell, man, you know.

375
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,467
I don't rock with the police,
you know what I'm saying?

376
00:28:54,764 --> 00:28:57,065
- Finger off the trigger.
- They never been my friend.

377
00:28:57,227 --> 00:28:58,885
- Then here you come.
- On the ground.

378
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:00,874
It's kind of bugging me out, you know.

379
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:04,552
You on some vigilante business.

380
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:06,122
Let's go.

381
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,762
- Jack...
- Put your arms around the pole.

382
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:11,458
I don't know what to think anymore.

383
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:14,791
- Here. Cuff yourself.
- What are you doing, Jack?

384
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,825
Yeah, it's a little strange.

385
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:20,362
You know? By any definition, this here.

386
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:22,214
All right, kid. Good.

387
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:23,873
Okay.

388
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:27,588
Okay, okay, okay.

389
00:29:27,947 --> 00:29:29,605
Okay.

390
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:32,040
Okay.

391
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:35,653
You should have done
what you always do, Jack.

392
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:40,168
- Where's your phone?
- It's on the left-hand side.

393
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,877
They know I'm here.
If I don't answer it...

394
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,258
- Jack?
- Let's go, kid. Come on.

395
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:06,056
- Bob.
- Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank.

396
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:08,257
All right, I'm impressed, Jack.

397
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:09,507
Did you shoot him too?

398
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,961
Send someone to check on Bobby.

399
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,579
Jack, you're not up to this.

400
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,566
All right? It's gonna end bad for you.

401
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:28,576
You lost the kid, didn't you?

402
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,266
He bailed on you. Well, you know what?

403
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:34,500
That is the best thing
that could have happened.

404
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,943
So why don't you go home.

405
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:37,285
Forget about what happened.

406
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:39,872
We'll take it from here.
Are you looking for him?

407
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:41,701
And you can't find him.

408
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,874
We're gonna find him, all right?

409
00:30:44,395 --> 00:30:45,573
We're gonna find him.

410
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:48,357
All right, Jack, now you can hang up.

411
00:30:52,075 --> 00:30:53,864
Where are you, kid?

412
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:56,738
All right. Now, let's see
which way he went.

413
00:30:56,907 --> 00:30:59,395
Did he go up? Did he go down?

414
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:01,898
In or out, Jackie.
Which way did he go?

415
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:06,441
Let's see if he went down.

416
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,530
- Excuse me, sir, do you mind swiping?
- Get a job, man.

417
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:12,357
Ma'am, would you mind swiping me in?

418
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,392
Ma'am? Ma'am, would you mind
swiping me in, please, ma'am?

419
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:18,498
I have a very important
appointment I have to...

420
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:23,971
Excuse me, ma'am, would you mind...?
Somebody mind swiping me in?

421
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:27,237
I'm trying to get
to an important appointment.

422
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,956
Somebody help me. Somebody help me.

423
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:32,228
Somebody help me.

424
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:34,089
Hey.

425
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,320
Come here.

426
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:40,937
- Come on. Go.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

427
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:56,864
Eddie!

428
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,409
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

429
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:00,327
- Why are you running?
- What do you want?

430
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,662
It's too much, man.
I'm doing the rest on my own.

431
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:05,063
I'm doing what I said.
I'm getting out of here.

432
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:08,293
- Lf I can find you, they can find you!
- I'm doing what I said.

433
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:11,365
Eddie, listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

434
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:14,280
- I'm your only friend down here.
- No, you're not my friend.

435
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:17,542
- I can do this...
- Friend? You don't even know me!

436
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:19,976
And get me where?
You gonna get me shot.

437
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:23,715
Ever since I've been with you, people been
trying to shoot me. People you know!

438
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:27,014
Look, man, I got someplace I need to be.
I got something I need to do.

439
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,765
Unless you gonna shoot me or arrest me,
I'm going, Jack.

440
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:32,931
- I can't let you leave.
- Thank you, Jack Mosley. I'm going.

441
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,466
- You can't leave.
- Yes, I can. Thank you, Jack Mosley.

442
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:37,282
Stop. Don't do that. Stop.

443
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:39,752
Ladies and gentlemen...!
You're not going. Come here.

444
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:41,802
Eddie!

445
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:45,095
Okay, okay.
Okay, we gotta go.

446
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:47,648
- Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

447
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:52,100
Move! Move!

448
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,626
- Here, come on.
- What are you doing?

449
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:05,316
Taxi! Hey!

450
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,271
Taxi!

451
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:13,607
It's Kaller. He just missed them
at the Canal Street station.

452
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:15,785
Where, where, where?

453
00:33:16,075 --> 00:33:18,977
Shit. Where the hell is he?

454
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:21,256
Goddamn it.

455
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,524
We're gonna find you.

456
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:26,179
Yeah, this is Detective Nugent.
I need a triangulation...

457
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:30,208
...on Detective Torres' cell phone.
Area code (917) 935...

458
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:38,181
That cop back at the apartment,
he said you should do what you always do.

459
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:40,900
What did he...?
What did he mean by that?

460
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:45,671
You're not doing
what you always do, huh?

461
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:48,518
Jack Mosley, I get it. I see the signs.

462
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:51,879
I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I was wrong. You're the right guy.

463
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:55,109
I could have got another guy,
did something different, but I got you.

464
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:56,966
I appreciate it. You're the right guy.

465
00:33:57,131 --> 00:33:58,079
- Okay?
- Okay.

466
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:00,640
- This is Comtech, over.
- Yeah, go, this is Nugent.

467
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,778
GPS indicates they're on Bowery.

468
00:34:03,947 --> 00:34:05,889
Repeat, Bowery,
moving south towards Pell.

469
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,488
Speed indicates they're on foot.

470
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,666
Are you hearing this, boys?
He's in Chinatown.

471
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:11,750
Let's move in.

472
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:22,694
- What's the deal with that book?
- It's my business plans.

473
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,510
I'm moving to Seattle.
My sister's already living out there.

474
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:28,674
I'm gonna open up a bakery.
But it's only, like, a specialty bakery.

475
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:31,625
Birthday cakes for little kids.
There's a lot of money in that.

476
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:34,503
I'm gonna send you
a big birthday cake on your birthday...

477
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,033
- I hate birthday cakes.
- You hate birthday cakes?

478
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:38,918
First thing that doesn't go your way...

479
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,734
...you're gonna be slipping into
Carol's Clip and Curl...

480
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:43,808
...and stealing all her hair-care products.

481
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:46,400
Because you're a thief.
And that's what you are, Eddie.

482
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:49,866
- You're always gonna be a thief.
- People can change, Jack.

483
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:52,896
- Days change, seasons change. Not people.
- Yes, you do...

484
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:56,133
- People don't change, Eddie.
- Yes, you do. I'll get you that cake.

485
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:57,892
You know what it's gonna say on top?

486
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:01,801
"Jack Mosley, ha-ha-ha, eat this." Make you
eat your words, lick your fingers too.

487
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:03,556
Subject's moving west on Pell.

488
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:10,049
Subject now moving south on Doyers.
Still moving south on Doyers.

489
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:13,634
Bobby, you take Doyer, we got Pell.
And, Kaller, you close up Bowery.

490
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:15,145
- Copy that.
- Let's squeeze him.

491
00:35:15,307 --> 00:35:18,122
- Copy that, on my way.
- Why don't you pull up. Pull up.

492
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,217
- Sorry.
- Who is that? You can't go in here.

493
00:36:01,387 --> 00:36:02,728
Oh, sorry.

494
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:25,410
Look, man, I gotta be down there.
All right, you understand?

495
00:36:25,803 --> 00:36:29,512
I gotta be down there that way, and
there's streets and shit in between there.

496
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:33,122
You got some sort of plan?
Some sort of police plan or something?

497
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,975
I see your limp acting up.
You ought to get that checked out.

498
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:39,619
I have a buddy of mine
walking around with a limp just like that.

499
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:41,958
He don't wanna go
to the doctor, though, right?

500
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:45,571
Finally he go,
they say it's a fracture, right?

501
00:36:45,738 --> 00:36:48,455
And now it's infected.
They gotta cut it off at the knee.

502
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:51,297
Wasrt so bad, though.
He had no more pain.

503
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:54,184
He ended up moving to Jersey,
working for the PATH...

504
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,649
...being a motorman.
Got a pension and shit now.

505
00:36:56,811 --> 00:37:00,226
I guess everything happens for a reason,
you know what I mean?

506
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:02,696
You're a sunny little shit,
I'll give you that much.

507
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:10,506
Get in here! Get in that door!

508
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:12,899
Jack!

509
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:18,056
- Pull me in! Help me in!
- Come on, come on, come on.

510
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:19,266
Lock the door.

511
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,409
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hold up.

512
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:29,604
Come on.

513
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:00,963
- You all right?
- Yeah.

514
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,556
Jack, what are we doing?
Where are we going?

515
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:26,794
- Come on.
- Where we going, Jack?

516
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,568
Out of the way.

517
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,113
Over here.

518
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:35,910
Jack? How we even know that Centre Street
Courthouse is in this direction, Jack?

519
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:37,634
Jack? We gotta know...

520
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,394
Down! Head down!

521
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:42,623
Go!

522
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:47,424
Come on!

523
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:01,768
Kaller!

524
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:05,065
Push it.

525
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:36,640
You all right, Jack?

526
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:43,713
I was aiming for the kid,
if that makes you feel better.

527
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,737
Well, you missed!

528
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:52,546
That kid is gonna get you killed.

529
00:39:53,867 --> 00:39:55,655
He won'th that?

530
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:03,712
Well, I got all day.

531
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,074
How about you, you got all day?

532
00:40:10,122 --> 00:40:13,319
- Jack, you still there?
- Yeah.

533
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,952
Still here.

534
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:19,241
Well, this is awkward.

535
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:26,400
When I started this day...

536
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,734
...I never figured on trading
9 mils with my friend.

537
00:40:30,922 --> 00:40:36,421
I think we stopped being friends
right around 8:25, in that bar.

538
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,656
No.

539
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:44,201
No, that's not gonna erase
20 years together.

540
00:40:44,426 --> 00:40:45,735
We're still friends.

541
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:51,975
Look...

542
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,174
...a lot I'd take back, but I can't.

543
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:59,945
Well, so you move forward.
Next day, next case.

544
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:03,074
- Lines were crossed.
- What lines?

545
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:08,261
- You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank.
- What lines? There are no lines!

546
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:11,042
There's getting it done
and not getting it done, period!

547
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:15,138
You put the bad guys away
no matter what it takes.

548
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,728
Now, you're gonna ruin the lives...

549
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:20,291
...of six cops.

550
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:22,948
Good cops.

551
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,837
Good men.

552
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:32,608
Are you ready to sacrifice
their lives for that kid?

553
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:35,465
Hey, Frank.

554
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,543
- Frank.
- Yeah?

555
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:40,903
This is not about me
ruining anybody's life.

556
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,238
Okay? This is about you.

557
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,956
You hear me?

558
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:48,449
Yeah.

559
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,332
You look at that kid's jacket?

560
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,371
I did.

561
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,800
- Armed robbery, assault, beats old women...
- I never had no armed robbery!

562
00:41:57,963 --> 00:42:00,962
Beats old women over the heads,
steals their Social Security checks.

563
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,000
- One time, I used...
- Shut up. Shut up.

564
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,959
Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.

565
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:11,108
No, Jack, listen to him.
No, that kid, he's sharp.

566
00:42:11,274 --> 00:42:12,484
Yeah, he's playing you.

567
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:16,579
He's sharper than you are.

568
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,297
He's telling you stories, right?

569
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:22,183
He wants to be a good citizen.

570
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:24,644
Go to church.

571
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:27,168
Buy his mother a house.

572
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:31,048
But he has spent
more than half his life in prison.

573
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:38,021
Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell
for weapons possession.

574
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:40,870
- He's always gonna do what he has done.
- I wasrt...

575
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:44,329
He is a career criminal.
That's who you're protecting.

576
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:49,450
- You all right?
- Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side.

577
00:42:50,122 --> 00:42:51,366
He's got my gun too.

578
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:53,729
Now, if you can't see
how wrong this is...

579
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:56,768
...I promise you
I will speak from my heart...

580
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,137
...when I give the eulogy at your funeral.

581
00:43:01,258 --> 00:43:02,884
So...

582
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:05,700
...do you believe the kid?

583
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:10,696
Or do you believe your ex-partner?

584
00:43:15,402 --> 00:43:17,857
Frank, we're right
on the other side of the door.

585
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,717
Because...

586
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:23,075
...if you believe the kid...

587
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,717
...you got a choice to make.

588
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,640
Do you go through your ex-partner?

589
00:43:39,498 --> 00:43:41,221
Or do you choose door number two...

590
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:46,727
...and go back to where you came,
with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand?

591
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:58,854
You're not gonna get very far.
And what if your ex-partner is right, Jack?

592
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:02,593
What if he is right, and you're wasting
your whole miserable life?

593
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:23,140
- It's Frank.
- You all right?

594
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:25,859
Yeah. They're in the elevator.
Seal the building.

595
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:28,327
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, get on that.

596
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,408
Everybody out! Police!

597
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:35,557
Everybody out! Police!
Move, move! Police!

598
00:44:36,682 --> 00:44:39,529
- Frank, where are you?
- Bobby, I'm coming up!

599
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,650
All right. Come on, come on.
Upstairs. Seal the stairwell.

600
00:44:43,818 --> 00:44:46,055
- All right.
- Find the back stairs. Check the roof.

601
00:44:46,218 --> 00:44:47,713
- Come on, Mal! This way.
- Got you.

602
00:44:47,882 --> 00:44:50,152
- Maldonado, seal it up.
- Got you.

603
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:08,455
Hello? Hello? Hello?

604
00:45:12,362 --> 00:45:15,678
- No, nothing.
- No answer. He's not there. Come on.

605
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:25,768
I never open door.

606
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,029
Please. Please, help.

607
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:32,582
Come on.

608
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,600
Jack, Jack, Jack. Thank you.

609
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,985
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

610
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:47,423
- You saw that, right? You heard him, right?
- Yeah. He never opens the door.

611
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:59,273
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

612
00:45:59,914 --> 00:46:02,053
- Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

613
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:05,252
- You heard him, right, Jack?
- Not now, Eddie.

614
00:46:05,418 --> 00:46:08,451
- Keep your voice down.
- He said he never opens the door.

615
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:11,007
You know what that mean, right?

616
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,359
Not right now.
There's the signs everywhere.

617
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,305
- Yeah, ADA MacDonald, please.
- May I tell her who's calling?

618
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:21,800
Yeah, tell her it's the guy
that's got her witness.

619
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:31,906
You're driving a car
during a hurricane.

620
00:46:32,074 --> 00:46:33,536
Like:

621
00:46:33,706 --> 00:46:35,648
A hurricane.

622
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:38,753
And there's three people at a bus stop.

623
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:41,289
- A old woman.
- Yeah.

624
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,319
A friend, like my friend here.

625
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:47,561
Him. He save your life, your friend.

626
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:50,695
It's Detective Mosley for you.

627
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:51,971
- Mosley?
- Yeah?

628
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:53,862
Where are you?
Where's my witness?

629
00:46:54,026 --> 00:46:55,717
I'm about seven blocks from you.

630
00:46:55,882 --> 00:46:58,118
But there's about a ton of cops
between me and you.

631
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,940
And they all want this kid dead.

632
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:02,495
Not to mention that
you got a leak in your office.

633
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,633
- Somebody's talking to these cops.
- Shit.

634
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:08,355
What did you think was gonna happen
when you pinched Shue?

635
00:47:08,522 --> 00:47:10,889
You thought they'd just lay down
and go away quietly?

636
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,538
We thought if we went to the grand jury,
Shue would fold.

637
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:14,884
He bent but didn't break.

638
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,399
We were gonna throw it away until
we ran into Edward Bunker last night.

639
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:22,852
Jury's tenure ends at 10. Without that kid,
they'll vote no bill and it all goes away.

640
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:25,156
He's an eyewitness.
He makes this work.

641
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:27,940
Where are you? I'll send my squad.
Richard, pen.

642
00:47:45,418 --> 00:47:46,662
What room?

643
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,876
- So, what, are they coming?
- Yeah, they're coming.

644
00:47:56,234 --> 00:48:01,253
Good. Because I gotta be somewhere, man.
I got something to do.

645
00:48:01,418 --> 00:48:04,516
I gotta be someplace by noon.
I gotta go get something.

646
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,537
It's real important.

647
00:48:07,146 --> 00:48:08,193
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

648
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:11,335
Ortiz, I'm coming in the building.

649
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:14,433
Frank?

650
00:48:17,386 --> 00:48:21,379
- Touhey and Kaller are taken care of.
- Good. Find Bobby. He's on the back stairs.

651
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:24,164
Eddie, come here, put this on.
Here, come on, put that on.

652
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,646
But it's a big, hot, wool shirt.
It's hot. It's summer.

653
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:30,338
- You're dressed like a criminal.
- Oh, you want me to...?

654
00:48:30,506 --> 00:48:33,441
You want me to change my...?
I get it. But why can't I put that on?

655
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,137
- What about this?
- What about that?

656
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:38,438
- What's wrong with this? It's just a pattern.
- He don't even wear that.

657
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:39,878
Just put the... Here.

658
00:48:40,202 --> 00:48:41,729
Never mind. What about this?

659
00:48:41,898 --> 00:48:45,891
Is this all right? Mass-transit blue?

660
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,585
When I was locked up,
they had me work in the kitchen.

661
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:55,080
So one day a little dude
walk up to me and say:

662
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:57,129
"Hey, you think
you could bake me a cake?"

663
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,981
I said, "Yeah, I'll bake you a cake."

664
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:02,081
I ain't tell him I ain't never
baked a cake, you know.

665
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,711
But I ain't got shit else to do.

666
00:49:03,882 --> 00:49:07,657
So, you know, I read the instructions...

667
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:10,469
...I bake him a cake, you know,
for his daughter's birthday.

668
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:12,292
She'd come up there to visit him.

669
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:16,287
You know, it say,
"Happy Birthday, Angel," right?

670
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,492
He go crazy.
He can't get enough, you know.

671
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:23,041
He said, "Eddie, you done hooked me up.
Man, you the man."

672
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,599
And I started doing that.
It was good. I had a skill.

673
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,843
People look at me different.
They would start...

674
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,018
- You missed a button.
- Did I?

675
00:49:30,185 --> 00:49:32,193
Your buttons are all crooked.

676
00:49:32,362 --> 00:49:34,631
- Come on. Come on, man.
- All right.

677
00:49:35,402 --> 00:49:37,027
Nugent.

678
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,446
You're a prince.

679
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:47,044
- The word is 5E, boys, 5E.
- Got it.

680
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,352
Then I start doing my research,
doing my due diligence.

681
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:56,450
I found out, you know, it's good money
in birthday cakes for kids, you know.

682
00:49:56,778 --> 00:50:01,829
That type of thing, like Tweety Bird
or Bugs Bunny or something like that.

683
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:03,969
Or Yu-Gi-Oh!
You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh!?

684
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:08,831
- Yu-Gi-Oh!
- Yu-Gi-Oh! Kids love that, man.

685
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:16,421
You don't know Yu-Gi-Oh!?
You gotta get out more. Yu-Gi-Oh! Hot.

686
00:50:16,586 --> 00:50:17,763
Know what I'm saying?

687
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,087
I'm gonna make money, Jack.
Open up my bakery.

688
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,079
You gonna eat your words about me, Jack.
How do I look? Do I look all right?

689
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,414
- All right.
- Freeze! Police!

690
00:50:33,578 --> 00:50:35,814
- Police! Police!
- Shut up!

691
00:50:35,978 --> 00:50:37,439
- Oh, my God!
- Shut up!

692
00:50:38,762 --> 00:50:40,769
Frank, they gave us
the wrong apartment.

693
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:46,239
Put it down.

694
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:49,448
Put it down.

695
00:50:54,295 --> 00:50:55,669
Can't get lucky all the time.

696
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:57,843
You can be smart every day, though.

697
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:03,500
- All right, give me the gun.
- Hold on.

698
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:05,459
What are you doing?

699
00:51:10,871 --> 00:51:12,660
This place is crawling with cops, Eddie.

700
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:15,474
Hey, look at me.

701
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:20,141
Eddie, what are you doing?

702
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:22,806
How does it feel?

703
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:27,445
How does it feel?

704
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:29,836
You're a baker, right?

705
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:33,840
Eddie, listen to him.

706
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:36,044
Pull that trigger,
you go to jail for life.

707
00:51:36,983 --> 00:51:38,325
Frank, we're on our way down.

708
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,908
Frank, do you read me?

709
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:47,535
- You can't stop me, you understand?
- Time to go.

710
00:51:47,703 --> 00:51:50,518
- Time to go.
- You can't stop me.

711
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:54,736
You gave him a loaded weapon?

712
00:51:58,678 --> 00:52:00,402
- Frank.
- Bobby, get these things off me.

713
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:03,055
- Did he take your gun?
- They went south. Get out of here.

714
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:07,346
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece.
Give me a piece! Get over here.

715
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,875
Make a hole, make a hole.
Come on, make a hole.

716
00:52:26,422 --> 00:52:29,008
Speak to me.
Come on, somebody, speak to me.

717
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,589
Turn.

718
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:43,186
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

719
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,419
- Excuse me!
- Open up!

720
00:52:47,223 --> 00:52:49,165
Keep moving. Go.
Go, go, go.

721
00:52:51,447 --> 00:52:52,624
Oh, shit.

722
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:57,715
On the bus! Let's go.

723
00:53:02,935 --> 00:53:04,658
- Just keep driving.
- What are you doing?

724
00:53:04,822 --> 00:53:08,139
- I'm a cop. Lock the back door.
- He's got a gun!

725
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:12,176
No stops.
Tell them to hang on to something, Eddie!

726
00:53:12,342 --> 00:53:16,270
Hang on! Don't worry, this man,
he's a police officer.

727
00:53:16,438 --> 00:53:18,380
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- Hang on!

728
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:20,307
Everybody just hang on. Don't worry!

729
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:30,478
Right, right, right! Go right!

730
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:37,425
- What are you doing?
- Stop this thing!

731
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:50,671
Get down!

732
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,158
Get away from the bus!
Away from the bus!

733
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:23,473
Stay down! Stay down!

734
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:30,805
Heads down!

735
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:36,046
- Where the hell are you?
- Construction site at Baxter.

736
00:54:36,214 --> 00:54:37,392
He has hostages.

737
00:54:41,686 --> 00:54:42,897
Let me go.

738
00:54:50,647 --> 00:54:51,857
Listen!

739
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:55,118
Everybody, stand up.
They're not gonna shoot you.

740
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:57,588
Stand up in front of the windows.

741
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,085
They won't shoot you.
You, stay down. Stay down.

742
00:55:05,047 --> 00:55:07,534
Fill in the blanks. Fill in the spots.

743
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:09,742
Scoot over, scoot over! That's it.

744
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:12,726
- All right, get Gruber down here.
- Okay.

745
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:19,595
Hey!

746
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:22,028
All right, seal off that end.

747
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:37,523
- It's a busload.
- Jesus, this shit just gets deeper.

748
00:55:37,687 --> 00:55:39,280
- Bobby?
- Gruber's on his way.

749
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:42,668
All right. We gotta get
our stories straight, all right?

750
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,399
We're getting our stories straight?

751
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:51,762
Yeah, suit up.

752
00:56:02,614 --> 00:56:05,396
Thought we could handle this quickly
and quietly, commissioner.

753
00:56:05,558 --> 00:56:08,079
A guy shoots a cop,
takes a grand-jury witness hostage...

754
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:09,839
...and we're supposed to make nice?

755
00:56:10,006 --> 00:56:14,000
Commissioner, look, sir, this is...
Watch your back, sir.

756
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,955
This is my fault, all right?

757
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:19,315
I used to work with Mosley,
so I asked the captain to let me handle it.

758
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:22,828
I felt that I could bring him in.
I just didn't realize how far gone he was.

759
00:56:22,998 --> 00:56:26,414
- Stay on Tac 2, boys.
- Wait for command, here we go.

760
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,461
That's it, cover them up.

761
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,312
Good, okay. Great job. Thank you.

762
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:45,009
- Commissioner, sir. Captain.
- Hi, Mike.

763
00:56:45,174 --> 00:56:48,022
- What do we got?
- Cop. Twenty plus, flipped.

764
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:50,604
- Suicidal?
- Been to the farm twice the last four years.

765
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:52,662
- Twice?
- Twice. Nothing like this, though.

766
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:55,725
- What do you know, detective?
- Like the captain said, he flipped.

767
00:56:55,894 --> 00:56:59,156
After he nailed Shue, he started
spouting crap about making headlines.

768
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:01,457
There's no way
that you're getting this guy out.

769
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:05,844
Please fall back behind the barricades.
On the sidewalk.

770
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:07,948
Smart cop.

771
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:12,084
Okay. You're all gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

772
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:14,996
- Please, just move to the back of the bus.
- Jack?

773
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:17,460
Just move to the back of the bus,
please, right now.

774
00:57:17,623 --> 00:57:20,405
It's okay. You're gonna get off the bus.
I am a police officer.

775
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:24,112
Jack, it's Mike Sheehan from HNT.

776
00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:28,020
We worked that barricade deal
on the concourse a few years ago.

777
00:57:29,399 --> 00:57:32,268
I'm gonna put this thing down, okay?

778
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:38,483
- I'm sorry.
- Jack!

779
00:57:38,647 --> 00:57:41,134
I'm sorry that I got you
in this situation.

780
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:43,157
You know the drill, no weapons.

781
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,907
Listen, you're on the job.

782
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:48,432
- Just keep your head down.
- You know the deal.

783
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,020
I'm just gonna step in here,
nice and easy...

784
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:55,119
...and hand you this phone
so we can talk, okay?

785
00:57:55,286 --> 00:58:00,469
Make sure we got no injuries in there.
Jack, just open the door, okay?

786
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,692
- I need to...
- Just throw it, Mike!

787
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:05,139
- Okay, you got it.
- Throw it!

788
00:58:05,302 --> 00:58:09,361
Here you go. Jack...

789
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:16,621
Jack, can you hear me?

790
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:19,157
How many people you got in there, Jack?

791
00:58:20,214 --> 00:58:22,451
Count how many people are here.

792
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:26,220
Everybody put your hands up, please.

793
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:30,636
N. Y.P.D., we got a situation here.
We need you people back on the sidewalk.

794
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:34,548
- Stay behind the barricade.
- Twenty-six, 28. Okay, thank you.

795
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:37,230
That's everybody?
Please, don't cry, don't cry.

796
00:58:37,398 --> 00:58:42,450
Everything's gonna be all right, just relax.
Stay calm, okay? Thank you.

797
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:44,589
- What is it?
- Thirty-one. Thirty-one.

798
00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:51,635
Okay, we have about
40 people on the bus.

799
00:58:52,023 --> 00:58:54,063
Okay, that's good.

800
00:58:54,422 --> 00:58:57,237
You know, it's important
that we're clear with each other, Jack.

801
00:58:57,654 --> 00:59:00,621
ESU and HNT are in place.

802
00:59:02,775 --> 00:59:06,070
The block is sealed, Jack.
It's a frozen zone.

803
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:10,898
So let's work this out
so everybody can go home, all right?

804
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:14,576
That's all we wanna do.
Just end it, nice and easy.

805
00:59:15,702 --> 00:59:17,109
Jack?

806
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:20,020
Jack? This is as far as you go, buddy.

807
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:21,291
Keep talk...

808
00:59:39,382 --> 00:59:42,164
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

809
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:44,846
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

810
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,803
How are you?

811
00:59:46,966 --> 00:59:51,952
My name's Eddie. Hi, how you doing?
Everybody's okay?

812
00:59:55,862 --> 00:59:57,269
What's your name?

813
00:59:57,622 --> 00:59:59,989
- Christina.
- Christina.

814
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:04,818
That's a pretty name.
How old are you, Christina?

815
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:08,756
- Seven.
- Seven years old.

816
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:14,198
And my strawberry recipe...
I know I got one. Let me see.

817
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:17,780
Where's my strawberry recipe? Let's see.

818
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:21,901
Angel-food-cake recipe right here.

819
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:26,196
Here we go, strawberry fan.

820
01:00:26,902 --> 01:00:28,910
See right here on the top?

821
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:30,962
I can put a fan on the top.

822
01:00:31,607 --> 01:00:35,316
You know, like a Chinese fan?

823
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,710
I could do that.

824
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,401
Whers your birthday?

825
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:44,466
- September 22nd.
- Oh, so that's soon.

826
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:49,202
Gonna be 8 years old, huh?
That's gonna be a good day for you.

827
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:50,988
Whers your birthday?

828
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,642
Today, actually.

829
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:58,260
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday to you.

830
01:01:02,422 --> 01:01:05,739
And, yeah, every day
is somebody's birthday, you know.

831
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:08,944
That's gonna be the motto for my shop:

832
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,084
"Every day's a birthday," you know.

833
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:15,029
I didn't know my birthday
was gonna turn out like this, but...

834
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:19,794
Yeah, I'm glad to be, you know,
here, alive, you know.

835
01:01:22,102 --> 01:01:23,924
- Right here, Jack.
- Yeah, Sheehan.

836
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:25,683
Commissioner, sir.

837
01:01:25,846 --> 01:01:27,569
- Sheehan?
- Right here.

838
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:30,156
All right. This is what I want.

839
01:01:30,326 --> 01:01:33,424
I want you to get me
Assistant District Attorney MacDonald...

840
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:37,235
...a court stenographer
and somebody from TV.

841
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:39,122
Somebody that I would recognize.

842
01:01:39,286 --> 01:01:41,839
I want them to come on the bus
and record sworn testimony.

843
01:01:42,006 --> 01:01:46,065
When I get what I want,
I'll let everybody out. Safely.

844
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:50,867
- That's a tall order. It'll take some time...
- Just do it. I'm not in the mood, okay?

845
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,234
Get these people here in 15 minutes...

846
01:01:53,398 --> 01:01:55,820
...or I'm gonna shoot
these passengers one at a time...

847
01:01:55,991 --> 01:01:58,357
...and throw them out the door.
- Jack, be cool, okay?

848
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:01,366
Let's not do anything rash.
This thing can end without bloodshed.

849
01:02:01,526 --> 01:02:03,414
- Okay? We can work this...
- Fifteen minutes.

850
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:06,159
Jack? Jack?

851
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:10,930
He's gone.

852
01:02:12,726 --> 01:02:14,253
All right, everybody on your feet.

853
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,517
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Gotta get these people off this bus.

854
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:21,810
But you just made your call.
You called the DA. They said they'd come.

855
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:24,178
- Everybody's coming.
- Nobody's coming, okay?

856
01:02:24,342 --> 01:02:25,836
What do you mean,
nobody's coming?

857
01:02:26,006 --> 01:02:29,104
They're gonna breach this bus
in less than five minutes.

858
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:32,270
- They're gonna kill me, kill you...
- Jack, what about testifying?

859
01:02:32,438 --> 01:02:34,642
We're right here. We can go.
We can end this.

860
01:02:34,806 --> 01:02:37,140
- We can testify.
- Nobody's testifying.

861
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:40,109
It's all over, Eddie.

862
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:42,383
We lose, kid.

863
01:02:53,942 --> 01:02:56,561
- Hey, Ray.
- Frank.

864
01:02:56,726 --> 01:02:58,252
You...?

865
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:01,106
You guys going in?

866
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:03,605
The commissioner hasn't given us
the green light yet.

867
01:03:03,766 --> 01:03:09,516
Well, I don't need to remind you
that he shot two of us.

868
01:03:11,479 --> 01:03:13,333
Enough said.

869
01:03:13,782 --> 01:03:16,564
We got maybe 40 civilians on that bus.
Get them out.

870
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:18,734
I don't want anybody hurt,
including our guys.

871
01:03:18,902 --> 01:03:21,870
Nobody's gonna get hurt, commissioner.
These guys know what to do.

872
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:31,212
- We have movement.
- Let's move in.

873
01:03:31,382 --> 01:03:34,099
- Hold your fire. Repeat, hold your fire.
- Move in to the bus. Let's go.

874
01:03:36,982 --> 01:03:38,673
Hey. What...?

875
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,515
Bob.

876
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,423
When you get outside...

877
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,378
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

878
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:50,095
They'll take you to a holding area.
It'll be hectic.

879
01:03:50,262 --> 01:03:53,044
- But everybody's out there...
- Listen to me, listen to me.

880
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:55,662
Once you get outside that perimeter,
you just get lost.

881
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,700
- What if they...?
- Keep moving. You just keep moving.

882
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,147
Come here. You look great.

883
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,001
Hey, gray suit.

884
01:04:03,094 --> 01:04:04,556
Got you a gray suit.

885
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:07,792
All right? Hands in the air, folks.
Don't look back.

886
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:18,357
Hands in the air, you'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

887
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,532
Next. Sorry.

888
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,706
Come on, come on, let's go!

889
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,626
- What is he doing?
- How should I know?

890
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,798
- I'll let you know when I know.
- Don't you...

891
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,235
I'll let you know when I know.
Out of my face!

892
01:04:58,998 --> 01:05:01,202
Kaller, give me a hand with them!

893
01:05:05,174 --> 01:05:07,443
Bobby? Right there. Right here.

894
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:10,543
- That's him. That's him.
- Hey, man!

895
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:13,646
- It's not him.
- Let him go.

896
01:05:13,814 --> 01:05:15,788
- The dude, he changed. It's not me.
- What?

897
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:18,511
- He's in a suit, a gray suit.
- Suit, gray suit.

898
01:05:38,582 --> 01:05:41,135
- We count 31.
- That leaves eight people on the bus.

899
01:05:41,302 --> 01:05:42,895
No, I was the last one off the bus.

900
01:05:43,062 --> 01:05:45,844
The only person left on that bus
is the guy with the gun.

901
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,626
- Then go, do it!
- Let's go, let's go.

902
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,889
- Get your people out there. Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

903
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:55,661
Mosley is still on the bus.
That kid is here somewhere. We checked...

904
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,554
Bobby, I don't care what you checked.

905
01:05:57,718 --> 01:06:00,173
Check it again, now. Go.
You guys, that way.

906
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:18,186
This is Detective Jack Mosley.
Shield number 227.

907
01:06:28,758 --> 01:06:31,213
I guess this will be
my last will and testament.

908
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,016
Don't shoot!

909
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,715
Hold your fire!

910
01:07:25,878 --> 01:07:27,602
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

911
01:07:27,766 --> 01:07:29,871
- Who is that?
- Hold your fire!

912
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,620
- Hold your fire!
- Is it that wit from the 32?

913
01:07:34,165 --> 01:07:36,337
Get on your goddamn radio.
Find out who that is.

914
01:07:36,502 --> 01:07:38,192
Guns down, hold your fire!

915
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:40,848
Don't shoot!

916
01:07:41,014 --> 01:07:42,869
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

917
01:07:44,885 --> 01:07:46,096
Don't shoot!

918
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,952
Don't shoot!

919
01:07:51,286 --> 01:07:54,548
- Do not move! Step away from the bus!
- Don't shoot, hold your fire!

920
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,619
- Do not shoot!
- Get away from the bus!

921
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:57,870
Hold your fire.

922
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:02,547
Jack. Jack, it's me. Jack Mosley!

923
01:08:03,158 --> 01:08:04,980
It's me, Eddie, Jack.

924
01:08:07,702 --> 01:08:09,044
Chuck Berry.

925
01:08:09,366 --> 01:08:10,795
Chuck Berry.

926
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,636
Chuck Berry,
he got locked up for armed robbery.

927
01:08:14,806 --> 01:08:16,977
He changed. He changed.

928
01:08:18,646 --> 01:08:22,028
Barry White, he stole 300 tires.

929
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:27,119
Can you picture big Barry White
stealing 300 tires? He changed.

930
01:08:27,286 --> 01:08:29,555
You said... You said people don't change.

931
01:08:30,101 --> 01:08:32,403
- People change.
- Eddie.

932
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,379
- What?
- You're killing me.

933
01:08:35,638 --> 01:08:39,216
Team three, breach the bus.
Repeat, team three, breach the bus.

934
01:08:39,382 --> 01:08:41,749
Entrance team moving in.

935
01:08:54,326 --> 01:08:56,715
Get out of the way!

936
01:08:57,526 --> 01:09:00,014
Head down!
Cover your ears and your eyes!

937
01:09:05,365 --> 01:09:06,543
- Hold fire.
- Go, go!

938
01:09:06,933 --> 01:09:08,908
- Go, go, go!
- Hold your fire!

939
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,060
This is a nightmare.

940
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,538
Hold fire!

941
01:09:57,782 --> 01:09:59,505
- Let's go! Move, move, move!
- Stay down!

942
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:01,077
- Move up! Move up!
- Come here.

943
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:03,856
Team two, status?

944
01:10:04,022 --> 01:10:06,989
Go ahead! Take it! Go!

945
01:10:36,342 --> 01:10:38,513
The bus is empty.

946
01:10:38,678 --> 01:10:40,303
They went through the bus doors!

947
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:43,950
They're in the goddamn building!
Seal it off!

948
01:10:44,598 --> 01:10:47,348
- All clear. The bus is empty.
- They've entered the building.

949
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,117
Seal the building, start a search.

950
01:10:51,285 --> 01:10:53,652
Remember, heads up.
He just shot two cops. Be careful.

951
01:10:55,894 --> 01:10:57,716
Jack, I gotta tell you something.

952
01:10:57,878 --> 01:11:00,180
Hey, man. Jack, listen to me, man.

953
01:11:00,342 --> 01:11:02,316
Jack, I wanna tell you something.

954
01:11:02,485 --> 01:11:06,031
Hold on, hold on, wait.
I gotta tell you something. It's important.

955
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,916
Shit. Get up, go.

956
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:12,851
Oh, shit.

957
01:11:13,973 --> 01:11:16,275
Hey, sir. I'm a cop, all right?
I'm on the job.

958
01:11:16,437 --> 01:11:18,379
Look, I need that phone for a minute.

959
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:20,077
Look what you did to my suit, man.

960
01:11:20,598 --> 01:11:23,118
I told you you was gonna get me shot.

961
01:11:24,086 --> 01:11:25,460
It's me. I need your help.

962
01:11:25,878 --> 01:11:29,806
All this started because my friend
Maurice came by my house.

963
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:34,826
Two days ago,
Maurice came by my house.

964
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:36,339
He all excited.

965
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,989
He got a shoebox.

966
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:40,402
He had a gun.

967
01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:43,021
He talking about,
"Hold this for me for a little while."

968
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:46,801
I'm like, "I'm on parole."
He like, "Me too."

969
01:11:46,965 --> 01:11:50,740
Next day, somebody shot him.

970
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:54,411
Thirty-two thousand dollars
in that shoebox.

971
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:59,056
- That's a sign, huh?
- Yeah.

972
01:11:59,222 --> 01:12:01,361
It's a very big sign.

973
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,947
Easy, easy, easy.

974
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:11,923
You know how much it gonna take me
to open the bakery?

975
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,652
Thirty-one thousand dollars.

976
01:12:16,821 --> 01:12:21,360
Jack, I got so nervous
I ran out the house.

977
01:12:21,525 --> 01:12:25,868
I went to Port Authority
and I put the money in a locker.

978
01:12:29,782 --> 01:12:30,992
I get back to my house...

979
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:33,394
...my parole officer's there...

980
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,118
...in my house.

981
01:12:35,286 --> 01:12:38,003
He got Maurice's gun in his hand.

982
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:41,297
He looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie."

983
01:12:41,621 --> 01:12:43,443
And he's talking about 15 years, man.

984
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:45,877
I got so sick.

985
01:12:46,037 --> 01:12:49,453
Then the DA came to my cell...

986
01:12:50,869 --> 01:12:53,771
...and he showed me
the picture of that cop.

987
01:12:55,221 --> 01:12:56,977
Then I met you.

988
01:12:57,493 --> 01:13:02,195
Jack, they clean them lockers out
every 24 hours.

989
01:13:03,574 --> 01:13:05,516
I had a little schedule going, man.

990
01:13:06,837 --> 01:13:09,139
Court at 10:00...

991
01:13:10,133 --> 01:13:12,305
...Port Authority at 12.

992
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,379
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.

993
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:17,044
You ain't gonna die on me, are you?

994
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,678
I don't know, I never died before.

995
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:24,049
It's not gonna happen today.

996
01:13:33,717 --> 01:13:35,146
Hey. Thank you for coming.

997
01:13:35,318 --> 01:13:39,955
- What's going on?
- Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.

998
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:42,066
Yeah, let's get him in.

999
01:13:44,214 --> 01:13:45,588
I know you.

1000
01:13:45,749 --> 01:13:47,538
- Come on.
- I was at your house.

1001
01:13:47,702 --> 01:13:49,709
- You were at my apartment?
- Had to get my gun.

1002
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:51,667
Bigmouth.

1003
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:55,442
It was very nice, very clean.

1004
01:13:56,469 --> 01:13:58,836
The police grilled me
for an hour at the hospital.

1005
01:13:58,997 --> 01:14:00,175
What'd you say to them?

1006
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:02,643
That you're a self-medicating,
depressed individual.

1007
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:04,878
And you don't care
about anything or anyone.

1008
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:09,355
Oh, she's honest, straightforward.
That's sexy. I like that.

1009
01:14:18,549 --> 01:14:20,011
What'd you do this time, Jack?

1010
01:14:20,182 --> 01:14:22,832
He saved my life a couple times.

1011
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:28,754
Hey, he's a good dude.
You gotta give him another chance.

1012
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:31,732
I don't know what he did,
but you gotta give him another chance.

1013
01:14:31,893 --> 01:14:34,228
He gotta have somebody to talk to.

1014
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:36,811
I'm not gonna be around.

1015
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:42,093
- Eddie, this is my sister, Diane.
- What?

1016
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:44,717
She's your sister?

1017
01:14:45,269 --> 01:14:47,025
Oh, man.

1018
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:50,735
I just started having a little hope for you.
Your family don't even like you.

1019
01:14:50,902 --> 01:14:53,455
I got a sister too.

1020
01:14:54,486 --> 01:14:57,104
But she live in Seattle.

1021
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,604
I was supposed to go out there
and start my bakery.

1022
01:14:59,765 --> 01:15:02,187
I was supposed to go out there today
to see her.

1023
01:15:02,357 --> 01:15:04,267
See her on the bus.

1024
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:06,159
I can stop the bleeding...

1025
01:15:06,325 --> 01:15:08,714
...but he's gotta get stitched up,
get to a hospital.

1026
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:11,212
We gotta be at the courthouse
in less than 20.

1027
01:15:11,701 --> 01:15:13,774
You're gonna have to do it.

1028
01:15:17,174 --> 01:15:19,759
You're gonna be fine, Eddie.
It's not as bad as it looks.

1029
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:23,632
What happened to your hand?

1030
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:27,211
I gotta ask you one more favor.

1031
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:31,467
Just a little favor.

1032
01:15:38,069 --> 01:15:40,273
Hey, is today really your birthday?

1033
01:15:40,437 --> 01:15:42,030
No.

1034
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:46,606
No, I just said that because the little girl,
she was so scared.

1035
01:15:47,285 --> 01:15:49,391
She was cute, man.

1036
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:52,116
Whers your birthday?

1037
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:57,266
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

1038
01:15:59,157 --> 01:16:01,743
No, for real, I don't know.

1039
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:05,684
I'm not... I came up in foster care.
Had a lot of birthdays.

1040
01:16:05,845 --> 01:16:10,482
But didn't you say...? You got a sister, right?
That you're going to see?

1041
01:16:10,645 --> 01:16:13,514
Yeah, I just found out about her
a couple months ago.

1042
01:16:13,685 --> 01:16:15,660
- Never met your sister?
- No.

1043
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,890
That's why I'm going out to Seattle
to meet her.

1044
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,194
I'm looking forward.

1045
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:25,041
Maybe she turns out
to look like Angelina Jolie.

1046
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:28,336
Shit, if she do,
I hope she ain't my sister.

1047
01:16:32,533 --> 01:16:34,737
Hey, man, what you want
on your cake, man?

1048
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:36,973
You never told me.
I gotta send you one, man.

1049
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,819
- I don't want no cake, Eddie.
- Damn it, Jack, come on, man...

1050
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:43,469
I can't think of anything
that has happened in my life...

1051
01:16:43,638 --> 01:16:46,572
...that I would want written on a cake.
- Nothing?

1052
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:50,484
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.

1053
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,517
I'm not a good guy.

1054
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:02,961
Yeah, me neither.

1055
01:17:16,982 --> 01:17:18,159
- Diane.
- Frank.

1056
01:17:18,325 --> 01:17:20,049
Give me the keys.

1057
01:17:20,214 --> 01:17:22,931
- Stay in the car.
- Little out of your sector, aren't you?

1058
01:17:23,094 --> 01:17:24,654
Saving lives knows no bounds.

1059
01:17:24,821 --> 01:17:27,210
- You should know that, Frank.
- You look good.

1060
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:29,520
You look a little desperate.
Doesrt suit you.

1061
01:17:29,685 --> 01:17:31,092
Open the door.

1062
01:17:31,253 --> 01:17:33,392
Open the door. Open the door.

1063
01:17:34,773 --> 01:17:37,140
Sorry, Jack, this is as close
as I can get you.

1064
01:17:43,477 --> 01:17:45,517
Like I said, you're looking good.

1065
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:51,499
Thanks, kid.

1066
01:17:52,565 --> 01:17:53,874
All right, come on, let's go.

1067
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:56,404
No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.

1068
01:17:56,565 --> 01:17:57,907
Why is that? Hold on for what?

1069
01:17:58,069 --> 01:17:59,891
This is as far as you go too.

1070
01:18:00,053 --> 01:18:02,093
- Come on, man. I don't...
- Listen to me, Eddie.

1071
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,595
- What?
- Listen.

1072
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:08,527
Those guys you were gonna
testify against...

1073
01:18:08,693 --> 01:18:10,668
...those cops?
- Yeah?

1074
01:18:12,085 --> 01:18:13,427
I was one of them.

1075
01:18:21,558 --> 01:18:23,859
You were gonna testify against me too.

1076
01:18:26,389 --> 01:18:28,397
I did what they did.

1077
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:30,932
We did some bad things.

1078
01:18:32,053 --> 01:18:35,119
I did another bad thing when I used you.

1079
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:40,336
I was gonna let you do
what I should have done.

1080
01:18:40,502 --> 01:18:43,404
What I should have had the courage
to do six years ago.

1081
01:18:48,629 --> 01:18:49,938
I'm sorry.

1082
01:18:54,869 --> 01:18:58,928
You know, if you didn't
come to get me today...

1083
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:02,259
...l'd be dead right now.

1084
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:04,145
- Right.
- So...

1085
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:08,045
I was supposed to meet you.

1086
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:10,768
That was the sign.

1087
01:19:11,157 --> 01:19:13,296
You saved my life, kid.

1088
01:19:18,005 --> 01:19:20,426
Take care of yourself, kid.

1089
01:19:22,261 --> 01:19:23,439
Thank you.

1090
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:26,991
Make cakes, Eddie the baker.

1091
01:19:34,389 --> 01:19:38,033
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys
to your best friend.

1092
01:19:38,197 --> 01:19:40,783
You let him take the old lady
to the hospital.

1093
01:19:40,949 --> 01:19:45,618
You stay at the bus stop with the girl
because she's the girl of your dreams, right?

1094
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,083
So everything's gonna be okay.

1095
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:50,837
- Right?
- Yeah.

1096
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,191
Have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister.

1097
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:55,884
Yeah.

1098
01:19:59,957 --> 01:20:01,386
Yeah.

1099
01:20:02,645 --> 01:20:05,329
Get him to the Port Authority.
Make sure he gets on that bus.

1100
01:20:05,493 --> 01:20:06,670
- Carl, thanks.
- No problem.

1101
01:20:06,837 --> 01:20:08,179
All right.

1102
01:21:17,781 --> 01:21:19,374
Hell of a morning, huh?

1103
01:21:29,045 --> 01:21:30,255
Where's the wit?

1104
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:33,777
You're looking at him.

1105
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,474
I let the kid go, Frank.

1106
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:44,585
- You're not gonna get to him now.
- Bullshit.

1107
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:47,440
Wouldrt do that.

1108
01:21:56,789 --> 01:21:58,350
So...

1109
01:22:00,117 --> 01:22:02,027
...what do you think
you're gonna tell them?

1110
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:05,292
Are you gonna tell them everything?

1111
01:22:05,461 --> 01:22:08,014
Are you gonna tell them about you too?

1112
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:11,598
You think that's gonna
make you feel better?

1113
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:13,647
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

1114
01:22:13,813 --> 01:22:15,471
Then why?

1115
01:22:16,693 --> 01:22:18,635
Look, Jack, you and me...

1116
01:22:18,805 --> 01:22:23,594
...we did our business in a certain way.

1117
01:22:25,717 --> 01:22:29,099
You never complained
when we cleared the tough cases.

1118
01:22:29,269 --> 01:22:32,881
It didn't bother you
doing any of that until...

1119
01:22:34,197 --> 01:22:36,815
Listen to me, all right? You listen.

1120
01:22:36,981 --> 01:22:39,763
Okay, Jack? Really listen.

1121
01:22:39,925 --> 01:22:42,707
Whatever you think
that you are gonna do up there...

1122
01:22:43,573 --> 01:22:45,296
...it is never gonna happen.

1123
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:48,684
You are not gonna make it.

1124
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:52,596
Is that what you're thinking, Frank?

1125
01:22:53,109 --> 01:22:57,102
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

1126
01:22:58,709 --> 01:23:01,196
Like the Ling family, huh?

1127
01:23:01,365 --> 01:23:02,543
Like they never knew.

1128
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:05,197
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1129
01:23:05,364 --> 01:23:07,786
All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

1130
01:23:07,957 --> 01:23:11,153
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?

1131
01:23:11,317 --> 01:23:14,383
Look, if it hadrt happened
the way that it did, if he hadrt died...

1132
01:23:14,549 --> 01:23:17,583
...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job."

1133
01:23:17,748 --> 01:23:20,367
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

1134
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:23,948
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1135
01:23:24,117 --> 01:23:26,931
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.

1136
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:30,322
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.

1137
01:23:30,485 --> 01:23:33,135
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.

1138
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:35,985
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

1139
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:39,345
- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!

1140
01:23:49,749 --> 01:23:51,123
Right.

1141
01:24:09,397 --> 01:24:11,982
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

1142
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:56,674
Bobby? He's on his way up.

1143
01:24:57,507 --> 01:24:58,455
Take him out.

1144
01:25:30,531 --> 01:25:33,215
Mosley's in the building!
Get the ADA. Freeze!

1145
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:35,234
- Hands in the air!
- Don't shoot.

1146
01:25:35,395 --> 01:25:37,467
- Don't move! Down on your knees.
- I'm not armed.

1147
01:25:37,635 --> 01:25:40,253
- Down on your knees! Now!
- Don't shoot, I'm not armed.

1148
01:25:40,419 --> 01:25:43,899
Lower your weapon. Just call
ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.

1149
01:25:44,067 --> 01:25:46,304
- Hands up.
- Get ADA MacDonald here right now!

1150
01:25:46,467 --> 01:25:48,671
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot me.
- Get your hands up!

1151
01:25:48,835 --> 01:25:50,525
Just get ADA MacDonald for me.

1152
01:25:50,691 --> 01:25:53,375
- Jack, come on!
- I won't argue with you. Get down.

1153
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:55,262
Mosley! Mosley!

1154
01:25:55,427 --> 01:25:56,637
Hands up!

1155
01:25:56,803 --> 01:25:58,975
Where's my witness?
Where's Edward Bunker?

1156
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:01,343
He didn't make it.

1157
01:26:02,147 --> 01:26:03,609
I'm gonna take his place.

1158
01:26:08,995 --> 01:26:11,809
- Please lower your weapons.
- Hold your fire and stand down.

1159
01:26:11,971 --> 01:26:13,531
Back off.

1160
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:17,659
I have information...

1161
01:26:17,826 --> 01:26:20,925
...regarding your ongoing
witness-tampering investigation.

1162
01:26:21,763 --> 01:26:24,414
Dates, cases that include extortion...

1163
01:26:24,963 --> 01:26:27,865
...manslaughter and possible homicide...

1164
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:31,392
...involving members
of the 14th Precinct.

1165
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:35,767
These charges include
Captain Dan Gruber...

1166
01:26:36,099 --> 01:26:38,172
...detectives Jerry Shue...

1167
01:26:38,851 --> 01:26:40,738
...Edward Maldonado...

1168
01:26:41,474 --> 01:26:43,613
...Bob Torres...

1169
01:26:43,779 --> 01:26:45,601
...Jim Mulvey...

1170
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:48,444
...myself...

1171
01:26:49,475 --> 01:26:51,133
...and Detective Frank Nugent.

1172
01:26:54,947 --> 01:26:57,565
What's this about, Mosley?
What do you want?

1173
01:26:58,307 --> 01:27:00,249
I want Edward Bunker's record expunged.

1174
01:27:00,451 --> 01:27:03,550
- Done. What else?
- Nothing else.

1175
01:27:03,715 --> 01:27:05,405
You can substantiate all this, Mosley?

1176
01:27:06,947 --> 01:27:08,353
Yeah.

1177
01:27:09,314 --> 01:27:10,362
Gun!

1178
01:27:16,355 --> 01:27:18,776
Hold your fire. I fired that shot.

1179
01:27:24,355 --> 01:27:27,868
You're gonna shoot me down here?
Nobody knows?

1180
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:31,451
Like the Ling family, huh?

1181
01:27:32,387 --> 01:27:34,492
Like they never knew.

1182
01:27:34,659 --> 01:27:37,147
He was a stupid old man
who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1183
01:27:37,315 --> 01:27:39,649
All right, so I stuck a gun
in some guy's mouth.

1184
01:27:39,811 --> 01:27:42,713
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what?
- So what?

1185
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,890
- So what?
- So how about he was innocent?

1186
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:47,393
- Innocent?
- How about he didn't deserve to die?

1187
01:27:47,555 --> 01:27:50,904
Look, if it hadrt happened
the way that it did, if he hadrt died...

1188
01:27:51,075 --> 01:27:53,890
...you would've been patting me
on the back, saying, "Good job."

1189
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:56,734
Collateral damage,
it is a fact of life in this business.

1190
01:27:56,899 --> 01:28:00,314
He took his last breaths while you were
wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1191
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:03,036
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was an innocent man.

1192
01:28:03,203 --> 01:28:06,302
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's husband.

1193
01:28:06,467 --> 01:28:09,117
- He was gonna take down our case.
- He was somebody's father.

1194
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:11,967
He was gonna take down our case!
What were we supposed to do?

1195
01:28:12,131 --> 01:28:15,000
- He wanted to tell the truth.
- Fuck the truth!

1196
01:28:18,563 --> 01:28:20,635
Let's get you to the jury.

1197
01:28:35,106 --> 01:28:36,088
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

1198
01:28:36,259 --> 01:28:37,469
Okay.

1199
01:28:53,698 --> 01:28:55,967
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Jack.

1200
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,138
Welcome back, Jack.

1201
01:28:58,306 --> 01:29:00,728
- Are you kidding me?
- Two years in the pen is enough.

1202
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:02,754
Thanks for that memory. Thank you.

1203
01:29:02,915 --> 01:29:04,671
- Happy birthday, Jack.
- Happy birthday.

1204
01:29:04,835 --> 01:29:07,104
- Happy birthday. Blow them out.
- Welcome home.

1205
01:29:07,267 --> 01:29:09,722
I hate birthdays, you know that, right?

1206
01:29:11,586 --> 01:29:14,139
- Sorry, sorry.
- Happy birthday.

1207
01:29:23,714 --> 01:29:25,438
This came with it.

1208
01:29:36,546 --> 01:29:38,456
Dear Jack Mosley:

1209
01:29:38,626 --> 01:29:43,034
I hope you're doing well and everything
worked out like it was supposed to.

1210
01:29:43,203 --> 01:29:45,145
I'm doing great.

1211
01:29:45,315 --> 01:29:47,224
Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.

1212
01:29:47,395 --> 01:29:51,585
I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air
before I got here. It's a trip.

1213
01:29:51,747 --> 01:29:55,063
Sometimes I can't believe it.
It's the best feeling I've had in my life.

1214
01:29:55,715 --> 01:29:57,537
I'm busting my ass,
but I'm happy, though.

1215
01:30:00,867 --> 01:30:03,256
The bakery is now open. Three cheers.

1216
01:30:04,994 --> 01:30:07,580
I put my name first
because I'm doing all the hard work.

1217
01:30:07,747 --> 01:30:09,721
These ovens are hot, man.

1218
01:30:09,891 --> 01:30:12,160
Hope you like the cake.
What did I tell you?

1219
01:30:12,322 --> 01:30:16,479
- That's Eddie.
- Lf you're ever in town, you got a friend.

1220
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:19,545
Thank you for doing the right thing,
Jack Mosley. God bless you.

1221
01:30:20,035 --> 01:30:23,613
Keep in touch. Peace.

1222
01:30:23,779 --> 01:30:25,918
- That's great.
- Go on, take one more. Look.

1223
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:30,305
You know how this guy...?
I was talking, take one more.

1224
01:30:31,874 --> 01:30:34,013
Happy birthday, Jack.

1225
01:37:29,122 --> 01:37:31,031
