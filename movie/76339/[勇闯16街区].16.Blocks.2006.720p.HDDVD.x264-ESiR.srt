8
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,453
但是他们所说得，并不是真正发生的事实
But what they tell you is not really what happened here.

9
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:08,598
所以，我希望你可以听到这些话
So I hope that you get this.

Couple hours. We gotta move now. Would you turn that thing off?

22

...but who's the detective and who's the lieutenant here?

60
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:10,029
我是想说，杰克，我没有别人可以做这件事了
I mean, Jack, I got nobody else.

61
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,134
这不是什么大不了的事情

他要穿好西装才能走
He's supposed to wear a suit when he leaves.

70
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,951
- 然后？ - 西装还没有送到
- And? - It's not here yet.

71
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,522
现在就把他给我弄出来，好不好？
Just get him out here, all right?

72
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:09,420
他们说，他一定要穿西装
They said he'd wear a suit.

73

不，对，我应该穿西装 是三件式的，灰色的

They brought the catalog down. I picked it out of the catalog.

77

我不穿西装，不能走的，等等

- 你自己跟他说 - 你不能让他这样做的
- You tell it to him. - No, that's why you brought my shoelaces.

- Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right? - Yeah, you sure?

一定要让老妇人上车，不然她就死定了
The old lady goes into the car, otherwise she dies.

83
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,482

84
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:42,421
你再想想看呢？
That's what... I don't know. You gotta figure out the answer for yourself.

85
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:46,256
两位警官，你们听我说，我要去上法庭
Everybody just calm down. Officer, I'm going to court.

86
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,057
- 我需要一套西装才能上庭 - 喂
- I'm supposed to have a suit. - Hey.

87

给我闭嘴，这是你的东西
Shut up. Here's your property.

88
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,865
- 这不是个好兆头. - 把手放在你的背后
- It's not a good sign. - Hands behind your back.

89
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,197
- 等等，我还要... - 手放到后面来
- Hold on, I'm trying... - Hands behind your back.

90
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:59,604
我还没有我的... 所有我的东西... 就等一分钟
I don't even have my... All my prop... Wait one minute.

91
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,736
这样不对 他们答应给我一件西装的
It's not right. They promised me the suit.

92
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:05,040
我从目录里面挑出来了一件的 等等，我的书
I picked it out of the catalog... Wait, my book.

93
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:08,309
这本书可不能掉了，对我来说，他很重要
I can't leave without my book. My book is very important to me.

94
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:11,515
你这么着急干什么？这不是个好兆头
Why are we rushing like this? It's not a good sign.

95
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:13,713
- 喂 - 到底是怎么个结果？
- Hey. - What's the damn answer?

96
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,257
- 喂！ - 闭嘴！
- Hey! - Shut up.

97
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,894
- 我讨厌警察 - 汽油还有一半
- I hate police. - Half a tank.

98
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:26,695
你就不能再等一会？
You could have had a little more patience.

99
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,237
这套西装可以对你来说没什么 你大概有一堆西装
This suit don't mean nothing to you. You probably got a bunch of suits.

100
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:33,103
但是对我却非同小可
But it's a whole different thing to me.

101
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,416
警车怎么都是这种样式？
These cars don't ever change, huh?

102
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:50,649
总是这一种车型
Traditional cruisers.

103
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:53,796
座位设计不合理
And the same retarded hump in the middle.

104
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:58,261
味道也总是那么难闻
Smell the same way, like Lysol and vomit.

105
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:02,569
这种味道让人呕吐 估计有人已经吐过
I hope nobody vomited back here. They probably did.

106
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,977
喂，老兄，问你个问题
Hey, man, let me ask you something.

107
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:16,481
我在想一个问题
I'm trying to figure this out.

108
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,684
你正在路上开车，突然刮起了龙卷风
You driving along in your hurricane, right?

109
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,222
有三个人在路边
There's three people at the bus stop.

110
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:25,418
一个是老奶奶，她病了，就快死了
Yeah, one is an old lady. She's sick, she about to die.

111
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,190
第二个是你最好的朋友
The second one is your best friend.

112
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,493
他救过你的命
He saved your life, right?

113
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:35,035
第三个是你的梦中情人
And the third is the girl of your dreams.

114
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:37,196
然后，是这样的...
Right, but check it out...

115
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,667
你的车只能再坐下一个人
...you only got space in the car for one person.

116
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:44,880
就这样，你会让谁上车？
Right? Who you take?

117
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:48,245
这可以说是一个性格测试
It's a riddle that's supposed to tell what type of person you are...

118
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,010
可以看出你是怎样一个人
...like where you at in your life.

119
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,747
你用不着这么严肃吧，老兄，只是一个假设
It's a hypothetical question, man, damn.

120
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,255
只是个假设而已
It's just a hypothetical...

121
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:59,054
好吧，好吧 我猜我知道你的答案了
Well, good. Fine, good. I guess that's my answer.

122
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:09,999
你为什么不开扩音警笛？
Why don't you get on the loudspeaker?

123
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:13,040
或者把警灯打开？
Put the Hawaii Five-0 light on or something.

124
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,338
显示一下你们警察的权威 按一按警笛
Use your police power. Put on a little siren.

125
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:18,310
让前面的车子都让开
Make room, make a hole.

126
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:21,349
你们警察不是最喜欢说，“闪开，闪开”？
Isn't that the saying, "Make a hole, make a hole"?

127
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:24,643
让他们靠边啊！
Go on, make a hole.

128
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:33,492
征兆，到处都是，都是征兆，征兆啊 处处都是
Signs. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs. All over, man.

129
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:36,158
我以前注意不到它们的
I used to not even see nothing like that, man.

130
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:40,770
后来我慢慢能够看到一些
And then I start seeing them. And I start looking for them.

131
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:43,368
到最后我发现一切是注定的
And everything just start falling in place.

132
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,609
我会没事的，直觉告诉我
I'm gonna be all right, where I'm supposed to be.

133
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:52,809
虽然没拿到我的西装 但一旦作证完毕
I ain't got my suit, but once they get my testimony...

134
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,349
他们就会撤消对我的指控，我就自由了
...they drop my charges, I'm free.

135
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,952
我觉得这是合理的
It's making sense to me.

136
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:59,285
我相信一定会那样的
I believe in that.

137
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,117
这是我的命
Being in the right place.

138
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,124
你相信命运么？
Being where you supposed to be. You believe in that?

139
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:07,286
我相信人生太漫长 而且有你这种人，让我更受煎熬
I believe life's too long and guys like you make it even longer.

140
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,600
太漫长？
Life's too long?

141
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,632
你不是说真的吧
Damn.

142
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,736
我从来没听人说过这样的话
That's some cold shit, man. I ain't never heard nobody say no shit like that.

143
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,040
人们总是想活得长点，你说对吧？
Usually you hear about people trying to make their life longer, you know?

144
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:27,775
而且他们用尽一切办法活得久一些 你看上去有点...
Trying to stay alive a little longer. You sound a little...

145
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:30,249
有点悲观，你还好吗？
...depressed or something, you all right?

146
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,714
你为什么停下了？
You stopping?

147
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,486
这里不是法院，老兄 你在干什么？
This ain't the courthouse, man. What you doing?

148
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:41,721
喂
Yo.

149
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,291
喂，你为什么停车？
Yo, why you stopping?

150
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:47,801
你应该送我去法院 你干嘛？
You gonna rush me out to court, and now you stopping? What are you...?

151
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,132
嗨，嗨，老兄
Hey. Hey, man.

152
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:55,108
嗨，老兄，听我说， 我上庭之后还有一个重要的约会
Hey, man. Listen, man, I got an important appointment after my court date, man.

153
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:59,044
不要和我开玩笑 拜托，老兄，这可不是做游戏
That shit ain't funny, man. Come on, man. It's not a game, man.

154
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:00,774
喂
Yo.

155
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,643
该死的
Some bullshit, man.

156
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:07,618
喂，喂！
Hey. Hey!

157
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,351
哦，不，你可太不负责了
No, man. It ain't Miller Time, man.

158
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:19,595
上午天气很晴朗 但是下午...
The weather will be clear early morning, but the rest of the day...

159
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,669
山姆，安吉娜，你们好！
Sam. Hey, Angela.

160
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:25,240
总的来说，今天会是闷热而潮湿的一天
So we are looking at a hot, humid day.

161
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,672
气温可能会攀升到100度
Looks like temperature might reach 100 degrees...

162
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:29,744
所以出门的时候，别忘了带你的防晒油
...so don't forget to pack your sunscreen.

163
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,608
给我个袋子装起来，好吗？
Add a pack of these, will you?

164
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,308
我就觉得这个老兄奇奇怪怪 真是倒霉
I know this dude smelled funny. I got the wrong dude, man.

165
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,451
17块5
17.50. What?

166
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:41,921
嗨，先别开，来，拿过来
Hey, don't open it. Come over here.

167
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,790
都几点了
What time is it, man?

168
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:46,724
8:11了
It's 8:11.

169
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,196
还好，还好
That's a good sign. That's a good sign.

170
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,166
我都上路了，我一定会准时到法院的
I'm on my way. I'm gonna get there.

171
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,435
- 要找零？ - 不，不用找了
- Want change? - No, you keep the change.

172
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:02,100
不用找了 好的，一切顺利
Keep the change. All right, you have a good day.

173
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,577
- 我不要花生 - 拜拜
- I don't want the peanuts. - Bye.

174
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:07,175
不，老兄，我什么也帮不了你，明白？
No, man. Can't do nothing for you, understand?

175
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,911
嗨，你还是把那找钱给我吧 我可能需要点零钞
Hey, you better give me that change. I'm gonna need that.

176
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,645
你自己看看吧？
You see my situation right here?

177
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:14,187
不，不，不！
No, no, no! No, no, no!

178
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:52,491
嗨！
Hey!

179
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:37,406
我怎么出去啊？
How am I supposed to get out?

180
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,398
- 快点 - 帮帮我，帮帮我
- Come on. - Help me. Help me.

181
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:49,251
- 我的书！告诉你别停下的！ - 左边，快跑
- My book. Why did you stop? - Go, left, go. Left.

182
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,286
快，快，快！
Move. Move. Move.

183
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,117
等等，停下！
Wait. Freeze!

184
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,556
到里面去，快点
In here. Come on.

185
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:03,790
该死的
Shit.

186
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:05,923
喂！
Hey!

187
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:09,162
快点给我滚开，走开！
Just get out of here, now! Go on. Go!

188
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:13,335
来，我们走 那边，快，快
Come on, let's go. That way, let's go. Go, go.

189
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:22,979
这边
Ready? Here.

190
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:30,216
快点走
Let's go. Go.

191
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:34,656
- 多米尼克，让你的人现在就出去 - 老天呢，杰克，怎么回事？
- Dominic, get people out of here, right now. - Jesus, Jackie. What's going on?

192
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:37,129
- 所有人，包括你，都给我出去 - 好的好的
- Everybody. You too. - All right, okay.

193
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:40,936
- 我们走 - 来，快点走
- Let's go. - Come on, come on, come on.

194
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:44,601
Hey, yo.

195
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:50,741
快点，别停下，快点出去
Come on, keep going. Come on. Come on, move it.

196
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:56,418
喂，我是杰克.莫斯里探员 编号227
Yeah, this is Detective Jack Mosley, shield number 227.

197
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:59,851
这里有紧急情况，地址是...等等
I am 10-13, at... Hold on a minute.

198
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:04,016
- 多米尼克,这里地址是什么？ - 毛布里大街133号
- Dominic, what's the address here? - 133 Mulberry.

199
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:06,094
毛布里大街133号
133 Mulberry.

200
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:09,856
毛布里大街
Mulberry Street.

201
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:12,933
好
All right.

202
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:23,373
他们什么时候能到?
Is they coming?

203
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,981
我真是不明白，你为什么刚刚要停车?
I don't know why you stopped, man.

204
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:34,286
我真是搞不懂
I don't know why you would do that, man.

205
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:38,254
他们说你是个小毛贼
They said you were nobody.

206
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:41,158
- 显然不是这样的 - 闭嘴
- I ain't nobody. - Shut up.

207
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:44,300
你这酒鬼，你不能再喝了，知道么?
You a wino. You need to stop drinking, that's what you need.

208
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,630
给我闭嘴
Shut up.

209
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,114
杰克？
Jack?

210
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:03,983
- 弗兰克 - 嗨
- Frank. - Hey.

211
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,015
你还好吗？
You all right?

212
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,747
嗯
- Yeah. - Yeah?

213
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:12,723
我们在无线电上听到你的呼救
We were on Mott when the call went out. Heard it was you.

214
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:14,994
我们就尽快过来了
Got here as soon as we could.

215
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,134
哦，你好
Oh, hi.

216
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:23,839
- 嗨 - 你还好吗？
- Hey. - You all right?

217
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,475
- 嗯，我还行 - 好玩吗？
- Yeah, I'm all right. - You having fun?

218
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:29,602
- 不 - 不？那好吧
- No. - No? Oh, well.

219
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,944
应该挺刺激的
Gotta have fun.

220
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:39,653
- 怎么了，杰克？ - 嘿，老弟，嗨
- What's up, Jack? - Hey, man. Hi.

221
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:44,955
你做得很好，很不错，老兄
You did a really great, great job, man.

222
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,323
你干掉了第一个杀手
You got yourself a bad guy.

223
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:50,858
有一阵子没这样了，是吧？
Been a while, huh? Yeah.

224
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:56,199
我们在一个街区之外，抓到了第二个枪手 所以，一切都结束了
We got the second shooter half a block from here, so it's done.

225
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:00,841
- 你肯定你没事？ - 我没事
- Sure you're okay? - Yeah.

226
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,468
我一路跑过来，只是有点累
I'm just getting my wind. I was running.

227
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:07,016
接下来的事情，让我们来处理吧
Why don't you let us take it from here.

228
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:09,481
你们应该这样做
Oh, yeah.

229
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:14,214
我们知道怎么处理这小子的事情 你什么也不用担心
We'll get the kid where he belongs, and you don't have to worry about a thing.

230
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,615
- 你回家吧 - 对，拜托你们了
- We'll get you home. - Yes, please.

231
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:19,353
求你了，求你了，长官 这个主意太好了
Please, please, officer. That's a very good idea...

232
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,464
因为，老实说，我真的觉得这老兄不行
...because, honestly, I don't think this dude is doing too good.

233
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:23,860
我跟他说了，别停车
I told him not to stop.

234
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,524
我给他说不要停车，可是他不听
I asked him not to stop. He just had to stop.

235
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:29,399
然后那个人就走到我车窗边
That's when everything happened. Dude came to the window.

236
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:32,063
我上庭之后还有一个很重要的约会呢
I have a very important appointment aft...

237
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:33,675
杰克
Jack.

238
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:36,042
舒，你好
Hey, Shue.

239
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,745
来，给你
Come on. Here.

240
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:48,447
拿着这个，来
Why don't you take this. Come on.

241
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,219
我们送你回家，门口有辆车
We'll get you out of here. Got a car waiting. All right?

242
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,827
回家好好睡一觉
Get some sleep.

243
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:57,823
杰克？
Jack?

244
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:32,264
这小子要指证杰瑞
The kid was gonna testify against Jerry.

245
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,432
他看到了杰瑞的一些事情
He saw Jerry doing some business.

246
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:41,471
我们都知道，杰瑞不会像你我一样那么靠得住
Now, we both know that Jerry has never been a standup guy like you and me.

247
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:47,472
他什么都会说出来 我们不能让那样的事情发生
He'll roll over, they indict him. We can't have that.

248
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,245
那样会牵涉到我们中的很多人
No. It's gonna hurt a lot of us.

249
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,622
过来
Come on.

250
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:10,132
其实本来不该由你来送他去法庭的
See, this whole thing caught us... It caught us completely unaware.

251
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:16,207
本来是由Teach的外甥来开车送他
It was supposed to be Teach's nephew driving him.

252
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,906
但是他因为塞车，没赶上
But he got stuck out there in traffic, who knows where...

253
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,075
结果你上司就让你去了
...so then your lieutenant, he pegged you.

254
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:29,315
今天发生的一切 都只是因为错误的时间，错误的地点
You know, just the wrong time and the wrong place for you today.

255
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:36,094
仅此一次，下不为例 你也知道我从来没有这样为难过你，对吧？
All right. Now, you know that I would never put you in a position like this, right?

256
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:38,290
你可以理解，对吧？
You know that, huh?

257
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:41,494
我也没想到他们会失手
And I never figured you'd cap one of those guys.

258
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:45,236
- 他妈的一群瘾君子 - 拿住枪
- That's what I get for hiring drug addicts. - Grab the gun.

259
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:51,305
就是那样
Grab the gun. There you go.

260
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:53,808
就这样，弗兰克
Come on. Frank?

261
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:58,047
- 好了 - 好了，动手吧，杰克
- Here we go. - All right, here we go. Jack.

262
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:00,520
扳扳机
Squeeze the trigger.

263
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,459
好了，放开枪，快松手
All right. Let go of the gun. Let go of the gun.

264
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:14,000
我帮你想好了一个借口
I figure it like this.

265
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:19,035
你干掉了那几个杀手后
You... You pop the guys trying to spring the kid.

266
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,972
这小子趁你不注意抢了你的枪
The kid, well, he gets your gun.

267
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,770
然后还把你当人质
And he takes you hostage.

268
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:28,383
然后我们出现，搞定一切
So we came in and saved the day.

269
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:30,849
他死了，你没有
He died, you lived.

270
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:35,315
我觉得这样不错，杰克
Now, this could be a good thing for you, Jack.

271
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,890
对大家都好交代
Get you back where you belong.

272
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:50,699
- 你还跟那个谁在一起吗？ - 给我站起来
- Are you still with...? - Stand up.

273
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:53,273
- 她叫什么来的？ - 站起来
- You still with what's-her-name? - Come on, stand up.

274
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,734
- 快啊 - 她叫什么名字？
- What are you waiting for? - What's her name?

275
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:15,025
凯罗琳
Caroline.

276
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,896
她叫凯罗琳
It's Caroline.

277
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:22,095
这下一切都不一样了，杰克
This changes everything, Jack.

278
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:26,931
站到那边去
Over here.

279
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,508
快点，弗兰克
Come on, Frank.

280
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:42,057
小子，起来，快点
Kid, get up. Come on.

281
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:49,995
天哪
Shit. Man, shit.

282
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,063
杰克，已经8:25了
All right, Jack, it's 8:25.

283
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,971
- 你给我站住别动 - 你听我说，陪审团最多等到10点
- You stay there. - Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10.

284
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:06,843
这小子只要迟到一分钟，这一切...
All right? The kid gets there one minute past, all this...

285
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:11,882
你做的一切就白做了
...it doesn't matter.

286
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,822
你再仔细想想
And all you gotta do is look the other way.

287
00:23:15,992 --> 00:23:17,926
好吗？一切都还好商量
All right? We still got options here.

288
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,391
好吗？
Okay?

289
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:20,790
我们只要那个小子
We just want the kid.

290
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:26,463
杰克啊杰克，我可是在帮你
Jack, Jack, Jack, just let me help you.

291
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:28,163
好不好？
All right?

292
00:23:28,337 --> 00:23:29,964
你给我退后
Back up.

293
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:36,233
杰克，一旦你走出那扇门...
Jack, once you go out that door...

294
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,377
我就帮不了你了
...I can't help you.

295
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:41,676
麻烦你退后，弗兰克 退后
Please just back up, Frank. Just back up.

296
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:03,362
他对警察开枪
He shot a cop.

297
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:06,233
你到底看到了些什么？ 看到了什么？
What the hell did you see? What did you see?

298
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,172
刚才那个警察
That cop back there.

299
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:09,971
我有次碰巧看到他...
I seen him around my way...

300
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:13,172
他把枪塞到那个可怜的波多黎各人的嘴里
...holding a gun in this little Puerto Rican kid's mouth.

301
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:15,146
快点，我们快点离开这里
Come on. Let's go.

302
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:18,412
他说，如果他出庭指证，就会杀了他的母亲
He said he'd kill his mother if he testified.

303
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:21,515
你那是干吗？我们需要那支枪
What you doing that for? We need that.

304
00:24:21,691 --> 00:24:24,990
那支枪已经有20年历史了 刚刚是我们运气，它居然还管用
The shell in that gun was over 20 years old. Lucky it went off at all.

305
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:28,221
- 他们没有告诉你舒是个警察？ - 不，他们没有告诉过我
- They didn't tell you Shue was a cop? - No, they didn't tell me.

306
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:30,490
他们只是给我看他的一张照片
They showed me a picture, that was it.

307
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,727
这下好，恭喜你 因为你和纽约最阴暗的一面开战了
Well, congratulations, because you're about to testify against one of New York's worst.

308
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:36,872
- 什么？ - 兄弟们，时间在一秒秒过去
- What? - Fellas, look, the clock's ticking.

309
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,167
他们必须在十点之前到达法院 我们知道他们的目的地
He's gotta be at the courthouse by 10. We know where he's going.

310
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:42,709
毛利，你跟我来
Mulvey, you're coming with me.

311
00:24:43,212 --> 00:24:45,339
- 知道你们该干什么了么？ - 我负责北边
- Know where you're going? - Take the north side.

312
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,141
- 明白了，我们走 - 快点
- You got it, let's go. - Come on.

313
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,217
- 上尉 - 怎么样了，弗兰克？
- Captain. - Where are we, Frank?

314
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:54,185
我们还没有让别区的人知道这件事情 只有本辖区的人知道大致情况
Well, we're putting descriptions out over precinct channels.

315
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:59,192
没有指明姓名，或者说其中一个是警察
No names, or that one's a cop. It'll help to have some eyes.

316
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:02,258
- 这件事，你能瞒多久？ - 他可开枪射击了一个警察！
- How long can you sit on this? - He shot a cop.

317
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:05,724
你是这个辖区的老大啊，丹 多久？
You're the precinct captain, Dan. How long?

318
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:08,962
我不知道，一小时，可能更短些
I don't know. Hour, maybe a little more.

319
00:25:09,572 --> 00:25:11,199
- 都是什么人和你一起处理这件事？ - 都是我们的人
- Who's on this with you? - My guys.

320
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:15,572
66分队的奥蒂斯跟马多纳多 111分队的图西和凯乐
Ortiz and Maldonado from the 66. Touhey and Kaller from the 111.

321
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:17,770
还有一些你也没兴趣知道
A couple others you don't wanna know about.

322
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:24,412
那个人做了你搭档20年了
The guy was your partner for 20 years.

323
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:26,919
他很清楚我们的做事方法 他到底是怎么了？
What the hell happened in there?

324
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:29,353
- 他是不是喝醉了？ - 我不知道
- Is he drunk? - I don't know.

325
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:31,986
我真的不知道
I don't know. We woke him up.

326
00:25:32,662 --> 00:25:35,790
希望他别多管闲事 这样我们大家都可以相安无事
Hopefully he'll do what he always does, and we can go back to work.

327
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:37,830
如果他不呢？
If he doesn't?

328
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:44,838
那我们要先下手为强，主动出击
We gotta quash this thing before he gets his legs back.

329
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,633
这里是他的地盘
These are his streets.

330
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:54,611
如果那小子开口，我们就惨了
This could get ugly for all of us if that kid talks.

331
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:57,116
- 他不能说 - 他不会说的
- He can't talk. - He won't talk.

332
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,088
你看，我很感激前面你为我做的一切
Look, I appreciate what you did for me back there...

333
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:02,918
但是我在想，你可能不适合送我去法院
...but I'm starting to think you're not the dude for this.

334
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,720
我是说，你上气不接下气，还喝醉了
I mean, you're out of breath, you're hung-over.

335
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:08,159
你说不定什么时候就倒下去了，老兄
Your leg is gonna give out on you any second, man.

336
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:11,630
我十二点一定要赴那个约，你明白吗？
I got someplace I need to be at 12, you understand?

337
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:13,701
所以十点前，我一定要结束法院的事情
I need to be finished at court by 10...

338
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,269
不然我就肯定会失约
...or I'm not gonna get where I'm supposed to get.

339
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:19,306
- 你明白我在说什么吗？ - 好了，我明白了
- You understand what I'm saying? - All right, I understand.

340
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:22,911
- 你根本没听我在说什么 - 等等，这边，这边走
- You're not listening to what I'm saying. - Wait, come here. Come here.

341
00:26:27,616 --> 00:26:29,106
快点
Come on.

342
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,551
醉酒
Hung-over.

343
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,519
腿受伤了
A bad leg.

344
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,487
没枪
No gun.

345
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:41,857
- 波比？ - 在
- Bobby? - Yeah?

346
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:44,864
- 你知道我在怀疑哪个地方了么？ - 我知道了
- You thinking what I'm thinking? - I'm already there.

347
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,357
天哪
Oh, God.

348
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:17,028
快点，我们进去
Come on, let's go.

349
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:21,898
听着，你在这里站着别动 我很快回来
Listen, just stay put right here. I'll be right back.

350
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:27,404
快点，别太久了，我们必须马上走
Come on, man, don't take long. We gotta go.

351
00:27:29,912 --> 00:27:31,504
抓紧点
Hurry up.

352
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:35,450
- 你洗手间在哪里？ - 什么？
- Hey, man, where your bathroom? - What?

353
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:37,483
洗手间在哪里？
Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at?

354
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,848
走廊尽头
Down at the end of the hall.

355
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:41,689
好的
Yeah.

356
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:46,819
你笑起来原来是这样
That's what you look like when you smile, huh?

357
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,928
可能也是喝醉了
You was probably drinking then too.

358
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,737
终于看到个女人
There's the lady.

359
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,531
红头发，很可爱，很不错
Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.

360
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:02,973
老兄，快点，别停下来
Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping to get high or nothing like that.

361
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:05,010
我们得快点离开这里
Man, we gotta go.

362
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:10,117
记住把厕板提起来
Make sure you lift the seat up before you go.

363
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,285
已经提起来了
It's up already.

364
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:20,288
你已经提起来了啊
Maybe you left it like that, huh?

365
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,695
我要来了
I'm coming.

366
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:20,083
嗨，杰克
Hey, Jack.

367
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:22,719
杰克.莫斯里
Jack Mosley.

368
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:27,891
你为什么那样做？
Why did you do that?

369
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:30,955
做什么？
Do what?

370
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,401
对那个警察开枪
Shoot that cop.

371
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:36,695
警察
Cops...

372
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,530
应该不会对自己人开火
...they don't shoot other cops.

373
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:43,876
尤其不会为了我这种小毛贼
Especially over nobody like me.

374
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:58,584
而且你并不认识我，你能这样做真是不容易
It's a long way to go for a stranger, you know.

375
00:30:00,262 --> 00:30:01,854
谢谢你
Thank you.

376
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:04,863
从来没有一个人...
I never had nobody...

377
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,865
该死的，你知道的
Hell, man, you know.

378
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:10,631
我从来就不喜欢警察 你知道我的意思么？
I don't rock with the police, you know what I'm saying?

379
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,340
- 放开扳机 - 他们从来不是我的朋友
- Finger off the trigger. - They never been my friend.

380
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,238
- 然后你出现了 - 把枪扔到地上
- Then here you come. - On the ground.

381
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:17,311
可是你和其他人不同
It's kind of bugging me out, you know.

382
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,147
你不像其他的警察
You on some vigilante business.

383
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:22,784
这边走
Let's go.

384
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,579
- 杰克 - 两手抱住这柱子
- Jack... - Put your arms around the pole.

385
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:28,347
我都有点怀疑自己了
I don't know what to think anymore.

386
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:31,823
- 用这个，给自己铐上 - 你在干什么，杰克？
- Here. Cuff yourself. - What are you doing, Jack?

387
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:34,986
是啊，这是有些奇怪
Yeah, it's a little strange.

388
00:30:35,164 --> 00:30:37,632
你知道么？这一切都让我有点不解
You know? By any definition, this here.

389
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,563
够了，小子，做得好
All right, kid. Good.

390
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:41,293
好的
Okay.

391
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:45,166
好了，好了，好了
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,270
好了
Okay.

393
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:49,808
好了
Okay.

394
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:53,576
你不该这样做的，杰克， 你应该像你以前那样
You should have done what you always do, Jack.

395
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:58,284
- 你手机呢？ - 在左边口袋里
- Where's your phone? - It's on the left-hand side.

396
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:02,151
他们知道我来了这里 如果我不接的话
They know I'm here. If I don't answer it...

397
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,762
- 杰克？ - 我们走，小子，快点
- Jack? - Let's go, kid. Come on.

398
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:25,277
- 鲍勃 - 鲍勃现在不方便讲电话，弗兰克
- Bob. - Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank.

399
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:27,572
好了，杰克，你很让我吃惊
All right, I'm impressed, Jack.

400
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,876
你也对他开枪了么？
Did you shoot him too?

401
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,520
派人去救波比
Send someone to check on Bobby.

402
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:40,421
杰克，你不会成功的
Jack, you're not up to this.

403
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,492
知道吗？你不会有好结果的
All right? It's gonna end bad for you.

404
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:48,759
那小子跑了，对吧？
You lost the kid, didn't you?

405
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,607
他把你甩了？好吧，你知道吗...
He bailed on you. Well, you know what?

406
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,936
这是最理想的情况了
That is the best thing that could have happened.

407
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,441
我建议你回家
So why don't you go home.

408
00:31:56,612 --> 00:31:57,840
忘掉所有的一切
Forget about what happened.

409
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,538
剩下的我们来处理
We'll take it from here. Are you looking for him?

410
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:02,445
你一个人是找不到他的
And you can't find him.

411
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:04,711
我们会找到他，知道吗？
We're gonna find him, all right?

412
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:06,482
我们会找到他

413
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:09,385
好了，杰克，现在你可以挂电话了
All right, Jack, now you can hang up.

414
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:15,127
你小子跑哪里去了？
Where are you, kid?

415
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:18,124
好吧，现在，我们好好想想他会跑到哪里去
All right. Now, let's see which way he went.

416
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,894
他是要坐巴士，还是要搭地铁？
Did he go up? Did he go down?

417
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,504
在街上还是藏在哪里？他逃去哪里了？
In or out, Jackie. Which way did he go?

418
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:28,241
我们来看看他是不是去了地铁站
Let's see if he went down.

419
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:32,505
- 麻烦，先生，你能帮我刷一下卡吗？ - 去找个工作，兄弟
- Excuse me, sir, do you mind swiping? - Get a job, man.

455
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:43,110

461
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:06,462
刚刚在你家的那个警察 他说你应该像你以前那样做
That cop back at the apartment, he said you should do what you always do.

462
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:09,297
他这样说是什么意思？
What did he...? What did he mean by that?

463
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:14,272
你没有像你以前那样做，对吗？
You're not doing what you always do, huh?

464
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:17,241
杰克.莫斯里，我知道了 我预感到了
Jack Mosley, I get it. I see the signs.

I'm where I'm supposed to be. I was wrong. You're the right guy.

477
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:59,112
我要开一个糕点店，不是一般的那种
I'm gonna open up a bakery. But it's only, like, a specialty bakery.

478
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:02,189
我的店只为小朋友做生日蛋糕 这样的店收入不错
Birthday cakes for little kids. There's a lot of money in that.

479
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:05,190

481
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:09,793
首先这不是你
First thing that doesn't go your way...

482
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:12,729
你会做的事情是偷偷闯入别人的理发店
...you're gonna be slipping into Carol's Clip and Curl...

483
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,892
然后偷走所有护发产品
...and stealing all her hair-care products.

484
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,595
因为你只会是一个小偷，爱迪
Because you're a thief. And that's what you are, Eddie.

- People don't change, Eddie. - Yes, you do. I'll get you that cake.

488
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:29,577
你知道蛋糕上会写什么吗？
You know what it's gonna say on top?

489

- Copy that, on my way. - Why don't you pull up. Pull up.

495
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:35,607
- 对不起 - 你们是谁？你们不能进去
- Sorry. - Who is that? You can't go in here.

496
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,183
噢，对不起
Oh, sorry.

497
00:37:56,772 --> 00:38:00,833
听着，老兄，我们的方向是那边 你明白吗？
Look, man, I gotta be down there. All right, you understand?

498
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:05,111
我们应该下去，然后朝那个方向
I gotta be down there that way, and there's streets and shit in between there.

499
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,875
你有什么计划吗？你不是警察么？
You got some sort of plan? Some sort of police plan or something?

500
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:11,849
我看你跛得越来越严重了 你应该去检查一下
I see your limp acting up. You ought to get that checked out.

501
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,649
我有个朋友 也像你这样跛着脚走路
I have a buddy of mine walking around with a limp just like that.

502
00:38:15,824 --> 00:38:18,088
但他不愿意看医生
He don't wanna go to the doctor, though, right?

503
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,855
最后他不得不去看了 他们说这是骨折
Finally he go, they say it's a fracture, right?

504
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,863
而且整条腿被感染了 膝盖以下都得被截掉
And now it's infected. They gotta cut it off at the knee.

505
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,826
这样也好，他不用那么痛苦了
Wasrt so bad, though. He had no more pain.

506
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:30,836
最后他去了新泽西州，找了一个工作
He ended up moving to Jersey, working for the PATH...

507
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:33,406
做火车司机，现在都他妈开始领养老金了
...being a motorman. Got a pension and shit now.

508
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:37,136
我认为每件事情都有它发生的原因 你懂我的意思吗？
I guess everything happens for a reason, you know what I mean?

509
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,712
你是个充满幻想的人 这就是我对你的评价
You're a sunny little shit, I'll give you that much.

510
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:47,855
进去！快进那扇门！
Get in here! Get in that door!

511
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,351
杰克！
Jack!

512
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:55,728
- 拉我进去！ - 快！
- Pull me in! Help me in! - Come on, come on, come on.

513
00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:56,989
把门锁了
Lock the door.

514
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:04,437
- 慢点，慢点 - 撑住
- Wait, wait, wait. - Hold up.

515
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:07,769
快点
Come on.

516
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,467
- 你没事吧？ - 嗯
- You all right? - Yeah.

517
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:59,854
杰克，我们在做什么？我们要去哪里？
Jack, what are we doing? Where are we going?

518
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:07,401
- 快点 - 我们要去哪里，杰克？
- Come on. - Where we going, Jack?

519
00:40:08,804 --> 00:40:10,294
让开
Out of the way.

520
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:11,905
过来这里
Over here.

521
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:16,907
杰克，这个是朝中心大街法院的方向？
Jack? How we even know that Centre Street Courthouse is in this direction, Jack?

522
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:18,705
杰克，确定是这个方向？
Jack? We gotta know...

523
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:21,582
趴下！头趴下！
Down! Head down!

524
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:23,907
走！
Go!

525
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:28,913
快点！
Come on!

526
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,869
凯乐！
Kaller!

527
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:47,307
推开它！
Push it.

528
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:20,231
你还好吧，杰克？
You all right, Jack?

529
00:41:25,046 --> 00:41:27,606
我瞄准的是那个小子，不是你
I was aiming for the kid, if that makes you feel better.

530
00:41:27,782 --> 00:41:29,716
那你没射中！
Well, you missed!

531
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:36,816
那小子会拖累死你的
That kid is gonna get you killed.

532
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:40,058
你觉得这样值得么？
He won'th that?

533
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:48,459
我可以一直这样和你拖延下去
Well, I got all day.

534
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:51,964
你呢，你有时间拖么？
How about you, you got all day?

535
00:41:55,143 --> 00:41:58,476
- 杰克，你还在吗？ - 嗯
- Jack, you still there? - Yeah.

536
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,179
还在
Still here.

537
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:04,651
这有点棘手了
Well, this is awkward.

538
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,116
今天早上我开始上班的时候
When I started this day...

539
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:15,592
没有想到今天会和你开枪对射
...I never figured on trading 9 mils with my friend.

540
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:22,565
我想在8:25，那个酒吧里 我们就已经不是朋友了
I think we stopped being friends right around 8:25, in that bar.

541
00:42:23,405 --> 00:42:24,895
不
No.

542
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,677
那不能抹杀掉我们一起工作的20年
No, that's not gonna erase 20 years together.

543
00:42:30,912 --> 00:42:32,277
我们仍然是朋友
We're still friends.

544
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:38,783
听着
Look...

545
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:42,119
我也后悔过许多以前做的事情 可是这些都不能挽回
...a lot I'd take back, but I can't.

546
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:47,093
所以你只能向前看 新的一天，新的工作
Well, so you move forward. Next day, next case.

547
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:50,356
- 但是不能违背了原则 - 什么原则？
- Lines were crossed. - What lines?

548
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:55,765
- 你听到了么，不能违背原则 - 什么原则？根本就没有原则！
- You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank. - What lines? There are no lines!

549
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:58,664
只有完成任务和完不成任务，就这样！
There's getting it done and not getting it done, period!

550
00:42:59,374 --> 00:43:02,935
有时也许我们的方法很过分 但是我们也是在除暴安良
You put the bad guys away no matter what it takes.

551
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:05,636
现在，你将牺牲...
Now, you're gonna ruin the lives...

552
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:08,308
6个警察的生命
...of six cops.

553
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:11,079
他们都是好警察
Good cops.

554
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:13,049
善良的人
Good men.

555
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:21,151
为了那个小子而牺牲掉他们，值得么？
Are you ready to sacrifice their lives for that kid?

556
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:24,131
弗兰克
Hey, Frank.

557
00:43:24,432 --> 00:43:26,297
- 弗兰克 - 嗯？
- Frank. - Yeah?

558
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:29,801
我没有想要牺牲任何人的生命
This is not about me ruining anybody's life.

559
00:43:29,971 --> 00:43:32,235
懂么？而是因为你
Okay? This is about you.

560
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,070
听到我说什么吗？
You hear me?

561
00:43:36,077 --> 00:43:37,669
嗯
Yeah.

562
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:40,675
你看过那个小子纪录了么？
You look at that kid's jacket?

563
00:43:42,217 --> 00:43:43,844
我看过
I did.

564
00:43:44,052 --> 00:43:47,419
- 持械抢劫，侵犯他人，殴打老年妇女... - 我从来没有持械抢劫过！
- Armed robbery, assault, beats old women... - I never had no armed robbery!

565
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:50,717
为了抢去社保金，他殴打一位老年妇女
Beats old women over the heads, steals their Social Security checks.

566
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:53,884
- 只有一次，我曾经... - 闭嘴
- One time, I used... - Shut up. Shut up.

567
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:55,927
噢，不，不要叫他闭嘴
Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up.

568
00:43:56,097 --> 00:44:01,296
不，杰克，让他讲 那个小子，他很聪明
No, Jack, listen to him. No, that kid, he's sharp.

569
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:02,731
其实他在耍你
Yeah, he's playing you.

570
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:07,001
他比你聪明
He's sharper than you are.

571
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:09,835
他在唬弄你，知道吗？
He's telling you stories, right?

572
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:12,844
他肯定对你说他要做一个好公民
He wants to be a good citizen.

573
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:15,410
要上教堂
Go to church.

574
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:18,042
要为她母亲买房子
Buy his mother a house.

575
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:22,087
但实际上他一生大部分的时间都在监狱里
But he has spent more than half his life in prison.

576
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:29,358
两个小时前 他还因为非法持械被捕
Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell for weapons possession.

577
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:32,329
- 他不会改变了 - 我没有...
- He's always gonna do what he has done. - I wasrt...

578
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,936
他是一个职业罪犯，而你却在保护他
He is a career criminal. That's who you're protecting.

579
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,275
- 你还好么？ - 嗯，弗兰克在另外一边对付他
- You all right? - Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side.

580
00:44:41,976 --> 00:44:43,273
我的枪也被他抢了
He's got my gun too.

581
00:44:43,678 --> 00:44:45,737
如果到现在，你都还执迷不悟的话...
Now, if you can't see how wrong this is...

582
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:48,906
我只能这样说
...I promise you I will speak from my heart...

583
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:52,419
我会在你的葬礼上为你念悼词
...when I give the eulogy at your funeral.

584
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:55,283
所以
So...

585
00:44:56,524 --> 00:44:58,219
你相信那小子？
...do you believe the kid?

586
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:03,429
还是相信你的前拍档？
Or do you believe your ex-partner?

587
00:45:08,336 --> 00:45:10,896
弗兰克，我们就在门的另一边
Frank, we're right on the other side of the door.

588
00:45:11,072 --> 00:45:12,835
因为...
Because...

589
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:16,336
如果你相信他的话...
...if you believe the kid...

590
00:45:18,947 --> 00:45:21,177
你必须做出选择
...you got a choice to make.

591
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:31,524
你要重新和你的搭档一起工作？
Do you go through your ex-partner?

592
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:35,258
或者你选择另一条路
Or do you choose door number two...

593
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:40,999
拖着你那条跛腿和受伤的手 继续和我们作对
...and go back to where you came, with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand?

594
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,644
你不会成功的 而且万一我说的是正确的呢，杰克？
You're not gonna get very far. And what if your ex-partner is right, Jack?

595
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:57,542
如果我是正确的 那你做的这一切又是为了什么呢?
What if he is right, and you're wasting your whole miserable life?

596
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:18,967
- 我是弗兰克 - 你没事吧？
- It's Frank. - You all right?

597
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,802
我没事，他们在电梯里 封锁整幢大楼
Yeah. They're in the elevator. Seal the building.

598
00:46:22,544 --> 00:46:24,375
跟上，波比 快点，我们上去
Come on, Bobby. Come on, get on that.

599
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,545
警察，所有人出去！
Everybody out! Police!

600
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:31,914
所有人出去！警察！ 快点，警察！
Everybody out! Police! Move, move! Police!

601
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:36,056
- 弗兰克，你在哪里？ - 波比，我上来了！
- Frank, where are you? - Bobby, I'm coming up!

602
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:40,353
好，快点 上楼，盯住楼梯间
All right. Come on, come on. Upstairs. Seal the stairwell.

603
00:46:40,528 --> 00:46:42,860
- 好 - 你去逃生梯看看，检查一下屋顶
- All right. - Find the back stairs. Check the roof.

604
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:44,589
- 快点！从这里走 - 收到
- Come on, Mal! This way. - Got you.

605
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:47,132
- 马多纳多， 守在这里 - 收到
- Maldonado, seal it up. - Got you.

606
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,217
喂？喂？有人吗？
Hello? Hello? Hello?

607
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:13,749
- 没人 - 没有人回答，没人在，我们走
- No, nothing. - No answer. He's not there. Come on.

608
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:24,270
我从不开门
I never open door.

609
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:27,670
请，请帮帮我
Please. Please, help.

610
00:47:30,078 --> 00:47:31,375
走吧
Come on.

611
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,650
杰克，杰克，谢谢你
Jack, Jack, Jack. Thank you.

612
00:47:39,754 --> 00:47:42,222
- 谢谢，太谢谢了 - 太谢谢你了
- Thank you. Thank you very much. - Thank you very much.

613
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,850
- 你听到他刚才所说的了，对吗？ - 恩，他说他从不开门
- You saw that, right? You heard him, right? - Yeah. He never opens the door.

614
00:47:56,237 --> 00:47:59,206
太谢谢你了，先生，谢谢你
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

615
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:02,104
- 谢谢你，太谢谢你了，先生 - 谢谢你
- Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. - Thank you.

616
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:05,440
- 你听到他说的他从不开门的，对吧？ - 知道了，爱迪
- You heard him, right, Jack? - Not now, Eddie.

617
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:08,776
- 小声点 - 他说他从不开门
- Keep your voice down. - He said he never opens the door.

618
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,441
你知道这意味着什么，对吗？
You know what that mean, right?

619
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:15,979
希望这不是坏的兆头
Not right now. There's the signs everywhere.

620
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:20,093
- 喂，请让副检察官马克当娜听电话 - 请问是谁打来的
- Yeah, ADA MacDonald, please. - May I tell her who's calling?

621
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:22,695
嗯，告诉她我是负责护送她的证人的
Yeah, tell her it's the guy that's got her witness.

622
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:33,232
你在飓风中开车
You're driving a car during a hurricane.

623
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:34,932
就是这个
Like:

624
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:37,134
飓风
A hurricane.

625
00:48:37,312 --> 00:48:40,372
路边站有三个人
And there's three people at a bus stop.

626
00:48:40,548 --> 00:48:43,016
- 一个老妇人 - 嗯
- A old woman. - Yeah.

627
00:48:43,184 --> 00:48:46,176
另外一个是你的朋友，就像我俩
A friend, like my friend here.

628
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:49,556
你的这位朋友曾经救了你一命
Him. He save your life, your friend.

629
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:52,824
莫斯里探员打来的电话
It's Detective Mosley for you.

630
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:54,154
- 莫斯里？ - 喂？
- Mosley? - Yeah?

631
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:56,126
你在哪里？我的证人在哪里？
Where are you? Where's my witness?

632
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:58,060
我大约离你有七个街区
I'm about seven blocks from you.

633
00:48:58,232 --> 00:49:00,564
但满街都是警察
But there's about a ton of cops between me and you.

634
00:49:00,735 --> 00:49:02,464
他们每个人都想想要这小子的命
And they all want this kid dead.

635
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:05,128
况且还有你办公室里面的一个奸细
Not to mention that you got a leak in your office.

636
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:08,400
- 不断地向这些警察走漏风声 - 该死
- Somebody's talking to these cops. - Shit.

637
00:49:08,576 --> 00:49:11,238
你当初起诉舒警官的时候 你就应该考虑到这些
What did you think was gonna happen when you pinched Shue?

638
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:13,880
你以为他们就束手就擒了？
You thought they'd just lay down and go away quietly?

639
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:16,642
我以为如果我们求助于大陪审团 舒会说出实情
We thought if we went to the grand jury, Shue would fold.

640
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:18,046
但他只是表面上妥协了
He bent but didn't break.

641
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:21,711
如果不是昨天晚上，我们发现了爱德华本克 我们已经放弃了
We were gonna throw it away until we ran into Edward Bunker last night.

642
00:49:22,156 --> 00:49:26,354
陪审团最晚能待到10点，没有那小子 他们不会立案
Jury's tenure ends at 10. Without that kid, they'll vote no bill and it all goes away.

643
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,757
他是目击证人 是整个案子的关键
He's an eyewitness. He makes this work.

644
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,660
你在哪里？我派我的人过来 理查得，给我一支笔
Where are you? I'll send my squad. Richard, pen.

645
00:49:49,884 --> 00:49:51,181
那个房间？
What room?

646
00:49:56,591 --> 00:50:00,789
- 怎么样，他们来吗？ - 嗯，他们要来
- So, what, are they coming? - Yeah, they're coming.

647
00:50:01,162 --> 00:50:06,395
太好了，庭审结束后我还有一个约会
Good. Because I gotta be somewhere, man. I got something to do.

648
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:09,798
我得在中午之前到那里 我一定不能失约的
I gotta be someplace by noon. I gotta go get something.

649
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:11,905
因为这是个很重要的约会
It's real important.

650
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,632
天哪
- Oh, shit. - Yeah.

651
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:16,908
奥蒂斯，我进来了
Ortiz, I'm coming in the building.

652
00:50:18,546 --> 00:50:20,138
弗兰克？
Frank?

653
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:27,381
- 图西和凯乐没事了 - 很好，去找波比，他在逃生梯那里
- Touhey and Kaller are taken care of. - Good. Find Bobby. He's on the back stairs.

654
00:50:27,555 --> 00:50:30,285
爱迪，过来，穿上这个 快点，穿上它
Eddie, come here, put this on. Here, come on, put that on.

655
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:33,916
这是羊毛衬衫 太热了，现在是夏天
But it's a big, hot, wool shirt. It's hot. It's summer.

656
00:50:34,095 --> 00:50:36,723
- 你穿的是囚衣 - 哦，你想让我换衣服？
- You're dressed like a criminal. - Oh, you want me to...?

657
00:50:36,898 --> 00:50:39,958
我明白了，但我想试试那件
You want me to change my...? I get it. But why can't I put that on?

658
00:50:40,134 --> 00:50:41,726
- 这件怎么样？ - 那件怎么了？
- What about this? - What about that?

659
00:50:41,903 --> 00:50:45,168
- 这件哪里不好了？你不喜欢它的样式？ - 这件太古怪了
- What's wrong with this? It's just a pattern. - He don't even wear that.

660
00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:46,670
让你不要穿这件，别说了
Just put the... Here.

661
00:50:47,008 --> 00:50:48,600
好吧，那这件怎么样？
Never mind. What about this?

662
00:50:48,776 --> 00:50:52,940
这件还行吧？普通的蓝色？
Is this all right? Mass-transit blue?

663
00:50:57,452 --> 00:50:59,920
我以前蹲监狱的时候 我曾在厨房工作
When I was locked up, they had me work in the kitchen.

664
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:02,521
有一天一个人过来跟我说
So one day a little dude walk up to me and say:

665
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,658
"嗨，你能帮我做一个蛋糕吗，我女儿生日"
"Hey, you think you could bake me a cake?"

666
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,589
我说，"好，可以啊"
I said, "Yeah, I'll bake you a cake."

667
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:09,821
你知道吗，那之前我从没做过蛋糕
I ain't tell him I ain't never baked a cake, you know.

668
00:51:09,997 --> 00:51:11,521
我想反正我也没事情
But I ain't got shit else to do.

669
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:15,635
所以，我就照着食谱
So, you know, I read the instructions...

670
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:18,567
给他做了一个蛋糕
...I bake him a cake, you know, for his daughter's birthday.

671
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:20,468
后来她女儿来探望他，他把这个蛋糕给她
She'd come up there to visit him.

672
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:24,634
蛋糕上写着，"生日快乐，天使"
You know, it say, "Happy Birthday, Angel," right?

673
00:51:25,246 --> 00:51:27,976
你不知道他有多感激我
He go crazy. He can't get enough, you know.

674
00:51:28,149 --> 00:51:31,676
他说，"爱迪，你太棒了！"
He said, "Eddie, you done hooked me up. Man, you the man."

675
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:34,344
从那以后我就一发不可收拾
And I started doing that. It was good. I had a skill.

676
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:36,683
人们开始尊重我，他们开始...
People look at me different. They would start...

677
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:38,951
- 你少扣了一个扣子 - 是吗？
- You missed a button. - Did I?

678
00:51:39,126 --> 00:51:41,219
你的扣子全扣歪了
Your buttons are all crooked.

679
00:51:41,395 --> 00:51:43,761
- 快点，伙计 - 好的
- Come on. Come on, man. - All right.

680
00:51:44,565 --> 00:51:46,260
纽金
Nugent.

681
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:50,867
真有你的
You're a prince.

682
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:56,705
- 房间是5E，伙计们，5E. - 收到
- The word is 5E, boys, 5E. - Got it.

683
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:02,239
然后我开始钻研做蛋糕的技巧
Then I start doing my research, doing my due diligence.

684
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:06,512
而且开一个专门做生日蛋糕的店 能赚不少钱
I found out, you know, it's good money in birthday cakes for kids, you know.

685
00:52:06,854 --> 00:52:12,121
你可以把蛋糕做成各种动物的形状
That type of thing, like Tweety Bird or Bugs Bunny or something like that.

686
00:52:12,293 --> 00:52:14,352
还有卡通人物雨果！ 你听过么？
Or Yu-Gi-Oh! You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh!?

687
00:52:15,463 --> 00:52:19,422
- 雨果！ - 雨果！小孩子们都喜欢那个
- Yu-Gi-Oh! - Yu-Gi-Oh! Kids love that, man.

688
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:27,336
你不知道雨果！？ 你不知道他有多受欢迎
You don't know Yu-Gi-Oh!? You gotta get out more. Yu-Gi-Oh! Hot.

689
00:52:27,508 --> 00:52:28,736
听到了么？
Know what I'm saying?

690
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:37,415
我会赚大钱的，杰克 经营我自己的糕点店
I'm gonna make money, Jack. Open up my bakery.

691
00:52:37,585 --> 00:52:41,578
你会收回你之前对我说的话，杰克 我看上去怎么样？还不错吧？
You gonna eat your words about me, Jack. How do I look? Do I look all right?

692
00:52:41,756 --> 00:52:45,055
- 好 - 不许动！警察！
- All right. - Freeze! Police!

693
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:47,558
- 警察！警察！ - 闭嘴！
- Police! Police! - Shut up!

694
00:52:47,728 --> 00:52:49,252
- 噢，天哪！ - 闭嘴
- Oh, my God! - Shut up!

695
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:52,724
弗兰克，不是这个房间
Frank, they gave us the wrong apartment.

696
00:52:56,904 --> 00:52:58,428
放下枪
Put it down.

697
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,774
快放下
Put it down.

698
00:53:06,828 --> 00:53:08,261
你不会每次都那么走运的
Can't get lucky all the time.

699
00:53:08,696 --> 00:53:10,527
但你干嘛不聪明点呢？
You can be smart every day, though.

700
00:53:13,434 --> 00:53:16,426
- 好了，把枪给我 - 等等
- All right, give me the gun. - Hold on.

701
00:53:16,604 --> 00:53:18,469
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

702
00:53:24,112 --> 00:53:25,977
这里全都是警察，爱迪
This place is crawling with cops, Eddie.

703
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:28,911
嗨，看着我
Hey, look at me.

704
00:53:30,718 --> 00:53:33,778
爱迪，你要干什么？
Eddie, what are you doing?

705
00:53:34,088 --> 00:53:36,556
这种感觉如何？
How does it feel?

706
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,394
感觉如何啊？
How does it feel?

707
00:53:41,896 --> 00:53:43,887
你还要开糕点店对吧？
You're a baker, right?

708
00:53:44,899 --> 00:53:48,062
爱迪，你听我说
Eddie, listen to him.

709
00:53:48,369 --> 00:53:50,360
你开了枪，这辈子你都会坐牢
Pull that trigger, you go to jail for life.

710
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:52,738
弗兰克，我们下来了
Frank, we're on our way down.

711
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:56,474
弗兰克，你能听见么？
Frank, do you read me?

712
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:02,342
- 你们阻止不了我 - 我们该走了
- You can't stop me, you understand? - Time to go.

713
00:54:02,517 --> 00:54:05,452
- 走吧 - 你们阻止不了我
- Time to go. - You can't stop me.

714
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:09,850
你居然给他了一把枪
You gave him a loaded weapon?

715
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:15,758
- 弗兰克. - 波比，快把手铐解开
- Frank. - Bobby, get these things off me.

716
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,524
- 他们拿你枪了么？ - 他们朝南走了，快追他们
- Did he take your gun? - They went south. Get out of here.

717
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:22,999
奥蒂斯， 给我一把枪 快给我一把枪
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece. Give me a piece! Get over here.

718
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:29,807
让开，让开，快让开
Make a hole, make a hole. Come on, make a hole.

719
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,586
有人么？有人在么？
Speak to me. Come on, somebody, speak to me.

720
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:50,363
走这边
Turn.

721
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:00,370
- 对不起 - 开门！
- Excuse me! - Open up!

722
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,741
- 对不起 - 开门！
- Excuse me! - Open up!

723
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,604
开车，快
Keep moving. Go. Go, go, go.

724
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:10,211
天哪
Oh, shit.

725
00:55:13,221 --> 00:55:15,519
他们在公共汽车上，我们快追
On the bus! Let's go.

726
00:55:20,962 --> 00:55:22,759
- 一直开，别停车， - 你干嘛？
- Just keep driving. - What are you doing?

727
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,388
- 我是警察，把后门锁上 - 他有枪！
- I'm a cop. Lock the back door. - He's got a gun!

728
00:55:27,902 --> 00:55:30,598
别停下 告诉他们抓紧了，爱迪!
No stops. Tell them to hang on to something, Eddie!

729
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:34,867
别担心，他是警察
Hang on! Don't worry, this man, he's a police officer.

730
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:37,067
- 别担心，一切都会好的 - 抓紧了
- Everything is gonna be fine. - Hang on!

731
00:55:37,245 --> 00:55:39,076
大家抓紧了，别慌张
Everybody just hang on. Don't worry!

732
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:49,681
右，右，向右转
Right, right, right! Go right!

733
00:55:54,695 --> 00:55:56,925
- 你们在干什么？ - 快把车停下！
- What are you doing? - Stop this thing!

734
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,737
趴下！
Get down!

735
00:56:37,471 --> 00:56:40,440
到一边去！离公共汽车远点
Get away from the bus! Away from the bus!

736
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:44,940
大家趴下，别动
Stay down! Stay down!

737
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:52,585
把头低下！
Heads down!

738
00:56:55,456 --> 00:56:58,050
- 你们在哪里？ - 巴可士街的建筑工地
- Where the hell are you? - Construction site at Baxter.

739
00:56:58,225 --> 00:56:59,453
他劫持有人质
He has hostages.

740
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:05,193
放了我吧
Let me go.

741
00:57:13,274 --> 00:57:14,536
大家听着
Listen!

742
00:57:14,842 --> 00:57:17,936
大家都站起来，他们不会向你们开枪的
Everybody, stand up. They're not gonna shoot you.

743
00:57:18,112 --> 00:57:20,512
站在玻璃前面
Stand up in front of the windows.

744
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:23,115
他们不会对你们开枪的 你，蹲下，别站起来
They won't shoot you. You, stay down. Stay down.

745
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:30,883
全部站在窗子那里去，别留下缝隙
Fill in the blanks. Fill in the spots.

746
00:57:31,058 --> 00:57:33,185
快点，快点，好的，就是这样
Scoot over, scoot over! That's it.

747
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:36,296
- 好吧，通知古博上尉 - 好的
- All right, get Gruber down here. - Okay.

748
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:43,459
喂！
Hey!

749
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:45,996
把那个出口封锁了
All right, seal off that end.

750
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:02,152
- 公共汽车上全是人 - 天哪，这下越搞越大了
- It's a busload. - Jesus, this shit just gets deeper.

751
00:58:02,323 --> 00:58:03,984
- 波比? - 古博马上就到
- Bobby? - Gruber's on his way.

752
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:07,517
好吧，我们要口径一致
All right. We gotta get our stories straight, all right?

753
00:58:07,695 --> 00:58:09,322
口径一致，知道了么？
We're getting our stories straight?

754
00:58:15,236 --> 00:58:16,999
把防弹背心穿上
Yeah, suit up.

755
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:31,216
局长，这件事何必劳您大驾？
Thought we could handle this quickly and quietly, commissioner.

756
00:58:31,385 --> 00:58:34,013
这个人朝警察开枪，还把一个大陪审团的证人劫为人质
A guy shoots a cop, takes a grand-jury witness hostage...

757
00:58:34,188 --> 00:58:35,849
我们不能对他客气了
...and we're supposed to make nice?

758
00:58:36,023 --> 00:58:40,187
局长，这...当心车门
Commissioner, look, sir, this is... Watch your back, sir.

759
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:42,226
这完全是我的错
This is my fault, all right?

760
00:58:42,396 --> 00:58:45,729
我和莫斯里原来是拍档， 所以我让警长把这这个案子交给我
I used to work with Mosley, so I asked the captain to let me handle it.

761
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,392
我认为我可以捉住他， 但我没想到他会这样
I felt that I could bring him in. I just didn't realize how far gone he was.

762
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:53,131
- 随时待命，弟兄们 - 随时待命，好的
- Stay on Tac 2, boys. - Wait for command, here we go.

763
00:58:54,842 --> 00:58:56,309
好的，把窗子蒙上
That's it, cover them up.

764
00:58:58,746 --> 00:59:02,409
非常好，谢谢你们
Good, okay. Great job. Thank you.

他们从前门逃跑了！

955
01:14:01,815 --> 01:14:04,215
喂，杰克，听我说

振作点，我们走

959
01:14:15,528 --> 01:14:17,428
妈的
Oh, shit.

960
01:14:18,598 --> 01:14:20,998
对不起，这位先生，我是一个警察 我在执行任务
Hey, sir. I'm a cop, all right? I'm on the job.

961
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:23,192
我借你的电话用下
Look, I need that phone for a minute.

962
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:24,962
看看你把我的西装弄成这样了
Look what you did to my suit, man.

963
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:28,133
我就知道你会让我中弹的
I told you you was gonna get me shot.

964
01:14:29,142 --> 01:14:30,575
是我，我需要你的帮助
It's me. I need your help.

965
01:14:31,011 --> 01:14:35,107
一切都是因为我朋友毛里斯
All this started because my friend Maurice came by my house.

966
01:14:36,883 --> 01:14:40,341
两天前他到我家来
Two days ago, Maurice came by my house.

967
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,919
他那时很慌张
He all excited.

968
01:14:42,088 --> 01:14:44,682
他手里拿着一个鞋盒
He got a shoebox.

969
01:14:44,858 --> 01:14:46,155
他有把枪
He had a gun.

970
01:14:46,326 --> 01:14:48,886
他对我说，“你帮我保管一阵子”
He talking about, "Hold this for me for a little while."

971
01:14:49,062 --> 01:14:52,828
我对他说，“我还在缓刑期内呢” 他说，“我也是”
I'm like, "I'm on parole." He like, "Me too."

972
01:14:52,999 --> 01:14:56,935
过了一天，他被杀了
Next day, somebody shot him.

973
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:00,763
鞋盒里面有三万两千块钱
Thirty-two thousand dollars in that shoebox.

974
01:15:02,876 --> 01:15:05,606
- 那是个凶兆，对吧 - 是的
- That's a sign, huh? - Yeah.

975
01:15:05,779 --> 01:15:08,009
那真是个凶兆
It's a very big sign.

976
01:15:08,181 --> 01:15:10,706
当心
Easy, easy, easy.

977
01:15:14,654 --> 01:15:19,023
你知道开个糕点店需要多少钱么？

978
01:15:21,428 --> 01:15:23,953
三万一千块钱
Thirty-one thousand dollars.

979
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:28,863
杰克，当时我不知道怎么办 我就冲出房外
Jack, I got so nervous I ran out the house.

980
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:33,563
把这些钱藏在了汽车站的储物柜里
I went to Port Authority and I put the money in a locker.

981
01:15:37,644 --> 01:15:38,906
当我回家的时候
I get back to my house...

982
01:15:39,079 --> 01:15:41,411
我的缓刑辅导员在那里
...my parole officer's there...

983
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:43,208
就在我家里
...in my house.

984
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:46,216
他发现了毛里斯留下的枪
He got Maurice's gun in his hand.

985
01:15:46,386 --> 01:15:49,651
他看着我，很失望的样子
He looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie."

986
01:15:49,989 --> 01:15:51,889
他说这至少得判15年
And he's talking about 15 years, man.

987
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:54,427
我吓呆了
I got so sick.

988
01:15:54,594 --> 01:15:58,155
后来检察官给我打来电话
Then the DA came to my cell...

989
01:15:59,632 --> 01:16:02,658
他给我看了那个警察的照片
...and he showed me the picture of that cop.

990
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,001
然后就是你
Then I met you.

991
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:11,442
杰克， 每天他们都要清理那些储物柜
Jack, they clean them lockers out every 24 hours.

992
01:16:12,879 --> 01:16:14,904
我的时间还挺紧的
I had a little schedule going, man.

993
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:18,682
10点钟上法庭作证

994
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:21,983
12点赶到汽车站
...Port Authority at 12.

995
01:16:22,155 --> 01:16:24,146
喂，看着我，清醒点
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.

996
01:16:24,991 --> 01:16:26,925
你不会在我面前死去，对么？
You ain't gonna die on me, are you?

997
01:16:29,095 --> 01:16:31,757
我怎么知道，我从来没有经历过死亡
I don't know, I never died before.

998
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:34,229
你今天不会死的
It's not gonna happen today.

999
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:45,800
谢谢你来这里
Hey. Thank you for coming.

- What's going on? - Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.

1001

1005

你的房间很漂亮，很干净
It was very nice, very clean.

1007
01:17:08,034 --> 01:17:10,502
警察在医院盘问了我一个小时
The police grilled me for an hour at the hospital.

1008
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:11,898
你对他们说了什么？
What'd you say to them?

1009
01:17:12,071 --> 01:17:14,471
我说你是个抑郁症患者
That you're a self-medicating, depressed individual.

1010
01:17:14,641 --> 01:17:16,802
我说你什么都能干得出来
And you don't care about anything or anyone.

1011
01:17:16,976 --> 01:17:21,470
她好坦率 这样很性感，我喜欢这样
Oh, she's honest, straightforward. That's sexy. I like that.

1012
01:17:31,057 --> 01:17:32,581
这次你又准备怎么做，杰克？
What'd you do this time, Jack?

1013
01:17:32,759 --> 01:17:35,523
他几次都救了我的命
He saved my life a couple times.

1014
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:41,698
他是个好人 你应该再给他一次机会
Hey, he's a good dude. You gotta give him another chance.

1015
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:44,803
我不知道他以前做了什么， 但是你应该再给他一次机会
I don't know what he did, but you gotta give him another chance.

1016
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:47,405
他需要一个谈话的人
He gotta have somebody to talk to.

1017
01:17:47,574 --> 01:17:50,099
我可不能一直陪他
I'm not gonna be around.

1018
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:55,606
- 爱迪，这是我妹妹，戴安. - 什么？
- Eddie, this is my sister, Diane. - What?

1019
01:17:56,249 --> 01:17:58,342
她是你妹妹？
She's your sister?

1020
01:17:58,918 --> 01:18:00,749
原来如此
Oh, man.

1021
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,617
我才开始对你有了好感 可是你的家人都不喜欢你
I just started having a little hope for you. Your family don't even like you.

1022
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:07,453
我也有一个妹妹
I got a sister too.

1023
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:11,258
但是她在西雅图
But she live in Seattle.

1024
01:18:11,431 --> 01:18:13,865
我本来打算去那里开我的糕点店的
I was supposed to go out there and start my bakery.

1025
01:18:14,033 --> 01:18:16,558
我本来今天就该出发的
I was supposed to go out there today to see her.

1026
01:18:16,736 --> 01:18:18,727
她说到汽车站来接我的
See her on the bus.

1027
01:18:19,472 --> 01:18:20,700
我现在把血止住了
I can stop the bleeding...

1028
01:18:20,873 --> 01:18:23,364
但是我们必须到医院去 把伤口给他缝上
...but he's gotta get stitched up, get to a hospital.

1029
01:18:23,876 --> 01:18:25,969
我们需要在20分钟内到法庭上去
We gotta be at the courthouse in less than 20.

1030
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:28,640
你必须得帮助我
You're gonna have to do it.

1031
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:34,881
一切都会好的，爱迪. 这不像看上去的那么糟糕
You're gonna be fine, Eddie. It's not as bad as it looks.

1032
01:18:37,156 --> 01:18:38,919
你的手怎么了？
What happened to your hand?

1033
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,651
看来你还得帮我个忙
I gotta ask you one more favor.

1034
01:18:44,564 --> 01:18:47,089
很小的忙
Just a little favor.

1035
01:18:53,973 --> 01:18:56,271
喂，今天真的是你的生日？
Hey, is today really your birthday?

1036
01:18:56,442 --> 01:18:58,103
不是
No.

1037
01:18:58,278 --> 01:19:02,874
我说今天是我的生日 因为我不想小女孩那么害怕
No, I just said that because the little girl, she was so scared.

1038
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:05,778
她很可爱
She was cute, man.

1039
01:19:06,686 --> 01:19:08,620
你生日是多久？
Whers your birthday?

1040
01:19:11,157 --> 01:19:13,990
- 我不知道 - 你不知道是什么意思？
- I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know?

1041
01:19:15,962 --> 01:19:18,658
真的，我不知道
No, for real, I don't know.

1042
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:22,767
我是在孤儿院长大的 那里太多的生日了
I'm not... I came up in foster care. Had a lot of birthdays.

1043
01:19:22,935 --> 01:19:27,770
但是你说有一个妹妹？你今天要去见的
But didn't you say...? You got a sister, right? That you're going to see?

1044
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,932
是啊，我几个月前才发现
Yeah, I just found out about her a couple months ago.

1045
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:33,169
- 你见过她么？ - 没有
- Never met your sister? - No.

1046
01:19:34,747 --> 01:19:37,580
那也是我去西雅图的原因，我想见她
That's why I'm going out to Seattle to meet her.

1047
01:19:38,685 --> 01:19:39,982
我很期待
I'm looking forward.

1048
01:19:40,153 --> 01:19:42,951
说不定她长得像安吉丽娜.朱丽呢
Maybe she turns out to look like Angelina Jolie.

1049
01:19:43,122 --> 01:19:46,387
我可不希望她只是我妹妹
Shit, if she do, I hope she ain't my sister.

1050
01:19:50,763 --> 01:19:53,061
你想要蛋糕上写什么字？
Hey, man, what you want on your cake, man?

1051
01:19:53,232 --> 01:19:55,393
我会给你做一个蛋糕的
You never told me. I gotta send you one, man.

1052
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:59,403
- 我不需要什么蛋糕，爱迪. - 别这么不给面子，老兄
- I don't want no cake, Eddie. - Damn it, Jack, come on, man...

1053
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:02,166
我想不起...
I can't think of anything that has happened in my life...

1054
01:20:02,342 --> 01:20:05,402
- 有什么我想写在蛋糕上面的 - 一句话都没有？
...that I would want written on a cake. - Nothing?

1055
01:20:07,547 --> 01:20:09,481
我不是一个好人，爱迪.
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.

1056
01:20:14,687 --> 01:20:16,814
我不是一个好人
I'm not a good guy.

1057
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,491
好吧，那我也不是
Yeah, me neither.

1058
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:38,338
- 戴安 - 弗兰克
- Diane. - Frank.

1059
01:20:38,511 --> 01:20:40,308
把钥匙给我
Give me the keys.

1060
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,313
- 呆在车里别出来 - 这里可不是你的辖区，不是么？
- Stay in the car. - Little out of your sector, aren't you?

1061
01:20:43,483 --> 01:20:45,110
救命可不分什么辖区
Saving lives knows no bounds.

1062
01:20:45,284 --> 01:20:47,775
- 这你应该很清楚， 弗兰克. - 你看上去气色不错嘛
- You should know that, Frank. - You look good.

1063
01:20:47,954 --> 01:20:50,184
你看上去有点绝望 这可不像你
You look a little desperate. Doesrt suit you.

1064
01:20:50,356 --> 01:20:51,823
把门打开
Open the door.

1065
01:20:51,991 --> 01:20:54,221
快把门打开
Open the door. Open the door.

1066
01:20:55,661 --> 01:20:58,129
对不起，杰克，我就只能送你到这里了
Sorry, Jack, this is as close as I can get you.

1067
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:06,864
好吧，算你走运
Like I said, you're looking good.

1068
01:21:11,544 --> 01:21:13,102
谢谢了，兄弟
Thanks, kid.

1069
01:21:14,213 --> 01:21:15,578
好吧，我们去法庭上
All right, come on, let's go.

1070
01:21:15,748 --> 01:21:18,216
不，等下
No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.

1071
01:21:18,384 --> 01:21:19,783
为什么？还等什么？
Why is that? Hold on for what?

1072
01:21:19,952 --> 01:21:21,852
你就到这里为止了
This is as far as you go too.

1073
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:24,148
- 什么意思？ - 听我说，爱迪
- Come on, man. I don't... - Listen to me, Eddie.

1074
01:21:24,323 --> 01:21:26,757
- 怎么了？ - 听着
- What? - Listen.

1075
01:21:28,161 --> 01:21:30,857
你要去指证的这些人
Those guys you were gonna testify against...

1076
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:33,089
- 这些警察 - 嗯？
...those cops? - Yeah?

1077
01:21:34,567 --> 01:21:35,966
我就是其中一个
I was one of them.

1078
01:21:44,444 --> 01:21:46,844
也就是说，你要去指证我
You were gonna testify against me too.

1079
01:21:49,482 --> 01:21:51,575
他们做的，我都做了
I did what they did.

1080
01:21:51,751 --> 01:21:54,219
我知道那很坏
We did some bad things.

1081
01:21:55,388 --> 01:21:58,585
我利用了你
I did another bad thing when I used you.

1082
01:21:59,826 --> 01:22:04,024
其实根本不需要你来指证我们
I was gonna let you do what I should have done.

1083
01:22:04,197 --> 01:22:07,223
我若干年前就应该自首了
What I should have had the courage to do six years ago.

1084
01:22:12,672 --> 01:22:14,037
对不起
I'm sorry.

1085
01:22:19,178 --> 01:22:23,410
你知道，要是今天不是你的话
You know, if you didn't come to get me today...

1086
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,884
我现在已经死了
...l'd be dead right now.

1087
01:22:27,053 --> 01:22:28,850
- 恩 - 所以...
- Right. - So...

1088
01:22:30,323 --> 01:22:32,917
今天我们见面
I was supposed to meet you.

1089
01:22:33,526 --> 01:22:35,756
是命中注定
That was the sign.

1090
01:22:36,162 --> 01:22:38,392
你救了我一命
You saved my life, kid.

1091
01:22:43,302 --> 01:22:45,827
保重了
Take care of yourself, kid.

1092
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,968
谢谢你
Thank you.

1093
01:22:49,509 --> 01:22:52,672
你可以做糕点了，爱迪师傅
Make cakes, Eddie the baker.

1094
01:23:00,386 --> 01:23:04,186
哦对了，你把车钥匙交给你的朋友
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys to your best friend.

1095
01:23:04,357 --> 01:23:07,053
你让他带老妇人去医院
You let him take the old lady to the hospital.

1096
01:23:07,226 --> 01:23:12,095
你在车站等那个梦中的女孩，对么？
You stay at the bus stop with the girl because she's the girl of your dreams, right?

1097
01:23:12,265 --> 01:23:14,665
所以一切都会好的
So everything's gonna be okay.

1098
01:23:15,568 --> 01:23:17,536
- 对吧？ - 嗯
- Right? - Yeah.

1099
01:23:18,804 --> 01:23:21,034
西雅图生活愉快！向你妹妹问好
Have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister.

1100
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:22,799
好的
Yeah.

1101
01:23:27,046 --> 01:23:28,536
好吧
Yeah.

1102
01:23:29,849 --> 01:23:32,647
你载他去汽车站 保证他赶上那班车
Get him to the Port Authority. Make sure he gets on that bus.

1103
01:23:32,818 --> 01:23:34,046
- 卡尔，多谢了 - 不用
- Carl, thanks. - No problem.

1104
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,619
好的
All right.

1105
01:24:48,194 --> 01:24:49,855
真是糟糕的一个早上，对吧？
Hell of a morning, huh?

1106
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:01,201
那小子呢？
Where's the wit?

1107
01:25:03,542 --> 01:25:04,873
他不在了
You're looking at him.

1108
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:10,813
我放他走了，弗兰克
I let the kid go, Frank.

1109
01:25:12,184 --> 01:25:16,143
- 你抓不住他了 - 去你的
- You're not gonna get to him now. - Bullshit.

1110
01:25:17,857 --> 01:25:19,119
你干什么？
Wouldrt do that.

1111
01:25:28,868 --> 01:25:30,495
那...
So...

1112
01:25:32,338 --> 01:25:34,329
你要在法庭上怎么说？
...what do you think you're gonna tell them?

1113
01:25:35,641 --> 01:25:37,734
你要把所有的事情都说出来么？
Are you gonna tell them everything?

1114
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:40,572
你要给他们说你也是一员么？
Are you gonna tell them about you too?

1115
01:25:42,148 --> 01:25:44,309
你觉得那样你良心就好受点了？
You think that's gonna make you feel better?

1116
01:25:44,717 --> 01:25:46,446
我怎么都不会好受点
Nothing's gonna make me feel better.

1117
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:48,348
那你这是为什么？
Then why?

1118
01:25:49,622 --> 01:25:51,647
你听我说，杰克，你和我...
Look, Jack, you and me...

1119
01:25:51,824 --> 01:25:56,818
我们一直就是这样做事的
...we did our business in a certain way.

1120
01:25:59,031 --> 01:26:02,558
即使是那些很棘手的案子， 我们也心照不宣
You never complained when we cleared the tough cases.

1121
01:26:02,735 --> 01:26:06,501
你以前什么都无所谓，直到...
It didn't bother you doing any of that until...

1122
01:26:07,873 --> 01:26:10,603
听我说，好么？听我说
Listen to me, all right? You listen.

1123
01:26:10,776 --> 01:26:13,677
杰克，你听好了
Okay, Jack? Really listen.

1124
01:26:13,846 --> 01:26:16,747
你如果想在法庭上揭露真相
Whatever you think that you are gonna do up there...

1125
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:19,447
我不会让那发生的
...it is never gonna happen.

1126
01:26:20,419 --> 01:26:22,979
你不会成功的
You are not gonna make it.

1127
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:27,058
你这样想么，弗兰克？
Is that what you're thinking, Frank?

1128
01:26:27,593 --> 01:26:31,757
你要在这里杀了我？ 你以为没人会知道？
You're gonna shoot me down here? Nobody knows?

1129
01:26:33,432 --> 01:26:36,026
就像你杀掉林家一样？
Like the Ling family, huh?

1130
01:26:36,202 --> 01:26:37,430
你以为别人看不出来？
Like they never knew.

1131
01:26:37,603 --> 01:26:40,197
他是个傻老头 他自己管不住自己的嘴巴
He was a stupid old man who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1132
01:26:40,372 --> 01:26:42,897
好吧，是我把枪指到他嘴里
All right, so I stuck a gun in some guy's mouth.

1133
01:26:43,075 --> 01:26:46,408
- 然后他心脏病发作了死了，又怎样? - 又怎样？
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what? - So what?

1134
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:49,776
你听着，如果他没有心脏病发，他没有死...
Look, if it hadrt happened the way that it did, if he hadrt died...

1135
01:26:49,949 --> 01:26:53,112
你当初就不会拍着我背说，“做得好”
...you would've been patting me on the back, saying, "Good job."

1136
01:26:53,285 --> 01:26:56,015
我们这一行，误伤总是会发生的
Collateral damage, it is a fact of life in this business.

1137
01:26:56,188 --> 01:26:59,749
你在房间里清理指纹的时候，他还活着
He took his last breaths while you were wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1138
01:26:59,925 --> 01:27:02,860
- 他不死我们就会完蛋 - 他是无辜的
- He was gonna take down our case. - He was an innocent man.

1139
01:27:03,028 --> 01:27:06,395
- 他不死我们就会完蛋 - 他是一个丈夫
- He was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's husband.

1140
01:27:06,565 --> 01:27:09,329
- 他不死我们就会完蛋 - 他是一位父亲
- He was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's father.

1141
01:27:09,502 --> 01:27:12,300
他不死我们就会完蛋！ 我们不得不那样做！
He was gonna take down our case! What were we supposed to do?

1142
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:15,804
- 他只是想把真相说出来 - 去他妈的真相
- He wanted to tell the truth. - Fuck the truth!

1143
01:27:26,652 --> 01:27:28,085
好吧
Right.

1144
01:27:47,139 --> 01:27:49,835
我再也不需要这个了
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

1145
01:28:34,468 --> 01:28:36,436
波比？他上来了
Bobby? He's on his way up.

1146
01:28:37,304 --> 01:28:38,293
干掉他
Take him out.

1147
01:29:11,739 --> 01:29:14,537
莫斯里在这里！快通知副检察官 别动！
Mosley's in the building! Get the ADA. Freeze!

1148
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:16,642
- 举起手来！ - 别开枪
- Hands in the air! - Don't shoot.

1149
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,971
- 别动！跪下！ - 我没有武器
- Don't move! Down on your knees. - I'm not armed.

1150
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:21,876
- 跪下！马上！ - 别开枪，我没有武器
- Down on your knees! Now! - Don't shoot, I'm not armed.

1151
01:29:22,049 --> 01:29:25,678
别用枪指着我 请通知副检察官马克当娜
Lower your weapon. Just call ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.

1152
01:29:25,853 --> 01:29:28,185
- 手举起来 - 让副检察官马克当娜到这里来，马上！

- Jack, come on! - I won't argue with you. Get down.

1156
01:29:35,729 --> 01:29:37,526
莫斯里! 莫斯里!
Mosley! Mosley!

1157
01:29:37,698 --> 01:29:38,960
手举起来！
Hands up!

1158
01:29:39,133 --> 01:29:41,397
我的证人呢？ 爱德华.本克在哪里去了？
Where's my witness? Where's Edward Bunker?

1159
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,867
他不能来了
He didn't make it.

1160
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:46,229
我代替他作证
I'm gonna take his place.

1161
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:54,780
- 请不要把枪对着我 - 你们把枪放下
- Please lower your weapons. - Hold your fire and stand down.

1162
01:29:54,948 --> 01:29:56,575
你们让开
Back off.

1163
01:29:58,752 --> 01:30:00,879
我有证据...

01:30:01,054 --> 01:30:04,285
证明有人想杀害你目前这个案子的证人
...regarding your ongoing witness-tampering investigation.

1165
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:07,923
我还要提供证据 有关很多刑讯逼供的案件
Dates, cases that include extortion...

1166
01:30:08,495 --> 01:30:11,521
伤害甚至谋杀证人
...manslaughter and possible homicide...

1167
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:15,199
这些案件涉及到14辖区的警察
...involving members of the 14th Precinct.

1168
01:30:16,303 --> 01:30:19,761
涉案人员包括丹.古博上尉
These charges include Captain Dan Gruber...

1169
01:30:20,107 --> 01:30:22,268

1173
01:30:31,318 --> 01:30:32,979

1174
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:35,783
还有法兰克.纽金探员
...and Detective Frank Nugent.

1175
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,490
你说这些是为了什么，莫斯里？ 你想要做什么？
What's this about, Mosley? What do you want?

1176
01:30:43,263 --> 01:30:45,288
我要还爱德华.本克一个清白
I want Edward Bunker's record expunged.

1177
01:30:45,499 --> 01:30:48,730
- 可以，还有其他要求么？ - 没有了
- Done. What else? - Nothing else.

1178
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,665
你可以证明你说的一切么，莫斯里？
You can substantiate all this, Mosley?

1179
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:53,739
是的
Yeah.

1180
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:55,833
枪！
Gun!

1181
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:04,607
别开枪，是我开的那枪
Hold your fire. I fired that shot.

1182
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:14,087
你要在这里杀了我？ 你以为没人会知道？
You're gonna shoot me down here? Nobody knows?

1183
01:31:16,196 --> 01:31:17,823
就像你杀掉林家一样？
Like the Ling family, huh?

1184
01:31:18,799 --> 01:31:20,994
你以为别人看不出来？
Like they never knew.

1185
01:31:21,168 --> 01:31:23,762
他是个傻老头 他自己管不住自己的嘴巴
He was a stupid old man who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.

1186
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,371
好吧，是我把枪指到他嘴里
All right, so I stuck a gun in some guy's mouth.

1187
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:29,566
- 然后他心脏病发作了死了，又怎样？ - 又怎样？
- He had a heart attack, he died. So what? - So what?

1188
01:31:29,743 --> 01:31:31,836
- 又怎样？ - 你可知道他是一个无辜的人？
- So what? - So how about he was innocent?

1189
01:31:32,012 --> 01:31:34,446
- 无辜？ - 他不该成为牺牲品
- Innocent? - How about he didn't deserve to die?

1190
01:31:34,615 --> 01:31:38,107
你听着，如果他没有心脏病发，他没有死...
Look, if it hadrt happened the way that it did, if he hadrt died...

1191
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:41,220
你当初就不会拍着我背说，“做得好”
...you would've been patting me on the back, saying, "Good job."

1192
01:31:41,388 --> 01:31:44,186
我们这一行，误伤总是会发生的
Collateral damage, it is a fact of life in this business.

1193
01:31:44,358 --> 01:31:47,919
你在房间里清理指纹的时候，他还活着
He took his last breaths while you were wiping the fingerprints off the room.

1194
01:31:48,095 --> 01:31:50,757
- 他不死我们就会完蛋 - 他是无辜的
- He was gonna take down our case. - He was an innocent man.

1195
01:31:50,931 --> 01:31:54,162
- 他不死我们就会完蛋 - 他是一个丈夫
- He was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's husband.

1196
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:57,098
- 他不死我们就会完蛋 - 他是一位父亲
- He was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's father.

1197
01:31:57,271 --> 01:32:00,069
他不死我们就会完蛋！ 我们不得不那样做！
He was gonna take down our case! What were we supposed to do?

1198
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,232
- 他只是想把真相说出来 - 去他妈的真相
- He wanted to tell the truth. - Fuck the truth!

1199
01:32:06,947 --> 01:32:09,108
我们带你到法庭上去
Let's get you to the jury.

1200
01:32:24,197 --> 01:32:25,221
- 谢谢 - 谢谢
- Thanks a lot. - Thanks.

1201
01:32:25,399 --> 01:32:26,661

欢迎回来，杰克
Welcome back, Jack.

1204
01:32:48,388 --> 01:32:50,913
- 你什么意思？ - 你在监狱里呆了两年，终于回来了
- Are you kidding me? - Two years in the pen is enough.

1205
01:32:51,091 --> 01:32:53,025
那可不是一段好的回忆
Thanks for that memory. Thank you.

1206
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:55,024
- 生日快乐，杰克 - 生日快乐

1207
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:57,561

- Happy birthday. Blow them out. - Welcome home.

1208
01:32:57,731 --> 01:33:00,291
我讨厌生日，你们都知道的，对吧？
I hate birthdays, you know that, right?

1209
01:33:02,235 --> 01:33:04,897
- 对不起 - 生日快乐
- Sorry, sorry. - Happy birthday.

1210
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,678
这里还有一封信
This came with it.

1211
01:33:28,261 --> 01:33:30,252

1213
01:33:35,202 --> 01:33:37,227
我很好
I'm doing great.

1214
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:39,395
西雅图同纽约不太一样，但是我很喜欢这里
Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.

1215
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:43,942
我从来没有呼吸过这么新鲜的空气 这就像一次旅游
I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air before I got here. It's a trip.

1216
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:47,569
有时我不敢相信，我现在的生活会是如此的美好
Sometimes I can't believe it. It's the best feeling I've had in my life.

1217
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,148
虽然现在生活很忙碌，但是我很开心
I'm busting my ass, but I'm happy, though.

1218
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,111
我的糕点店也开张了，哈哈
The bakery is now open. Three cheers.

1219
01:33:57,924 --> 01:34:00,620
我的糕点店叫做“爱迪和杰克的糕点店” 我把我的名字放前面，因为主要是我在打理它
I put my name first because I'm doing all the hard work.

1220
01:34:00,794 --> 01:34:02,853
烤箱很烫的，兄弟
These ovens are hot, man.

1221
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:05,396
希望你喜欢这个蛋糕 我说过会给你做个蛋糕的
Hope you like the cake. What did I tell you?

1222
01:34:05,565 --> 01:34:09,899
- 那是爱迪 - 如果你什么时候到这里来了，随时找我好了
- That's Eddie. - Lf you're ever in town, you got a friend.

1223
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:13,096
谢谢你为我做的一切，上帝保佑你，杰克.莫斯里
