1
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:52,298
In the last century
before the birth...

2
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:55,050
of the new faith
called Christianity...

3
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:58,012
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of Rome...

4
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,389
and bring about a new society...

5
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:05,227
the Roman republic stood at the very
centre of the civilized world.

6
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:07,938
"Of all things fairest,"
sang the poet...

7
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:12,610
"first among cities and
home of the gods is golden Rome."

8
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,446
Yet even at the zenith
of her pride and power...

9
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,824
the Republic lay fatally stricken
with a disease called...

10
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:21,118
human slavery.

11
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:23,704
The age of the dictator
was at hand...

12
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:27,791
waiting in the shadows
for the event to bring it forth.

13
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,960
In that same century...

14
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:32,755
in the conquered
Greek province of Thrace...

15
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:36,133
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master's wealth...

16
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:40,596
by giving birth to a son
whom she named Spartacus.

17
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,057
A proud, rebellious son...

18
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,185
who was sold to living death
in the mines of Libya...

19
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,230
before his thirteenth birthday.

20
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:52,149
There, under whip
and chain and sun...

21
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,903
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood...

22
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,364
dreaming the death of slavery...

23
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:01,951
2,000 years
before it finally would die.

24
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:48,247
Back to work!

25
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,882
Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

26
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,259
Come on, get up!

27
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:03,762
My ankle, my ankle!

28
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,848
My ankle!

29
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:18,360
Spartacus again?
This time he dies.

30
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,573
Back to work, all ofyou!

31
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:45,513
- Welcome, Lentulus Batiatus.
- Welcome, indeed, my dear captain.

32
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:53,437
Eleven miles
through the disastrous heat...

33
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:57,441
and the cost
of hiring an escort-- ruinous.

34
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:01,612
Even so, I warrant you have nothing
fit to sell me, have you, Captain?

35
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:05,407
I've wasted my time and my money.
Tell me the truth.

36
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,618
I think we have a few
you might be interested in.

37
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:12,498
What, these? Carrion!
The buzzards are late.

38
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:15,251
This one here's not bad.
He's a Gaul.

39
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:18,003
I don't like Gauls. Hairy.

40
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:23,509
-Can he come down from there unassisted?
-Come down, you!

41
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,428
Come down!

42
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,601
Be good enough
to show me the teeth.

43
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,688
- Open your mouth!
- Thank you.

44
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:41,402
Yes. As the teeth go,
so go the bones.

45
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:44,989
This mouth is
really impermissible.

46
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:48,951
- The fellow's made of chalk.
- We have others. Many others!

47
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:57,835
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

48
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,338
Who's that?

49
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:05,092
This one's a Thracian.
I'm making an example of him.

50
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:08,137
- How?
- Starve him to death.

51
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,431
It's the only thing impresses slaves.

52
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,600
What a pity.

53
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:20,232
He reacts. Good muscle tone.
Can I see his teeth?

54
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:23,277
Open your mouth, Spartacus!

55
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,905
You smell like a rhinoceros.

56
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,995
Captain, you asked him to open
his mouth. He doesn't obey you?

57
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:35,164
His teeth are
the best thing about him.

58
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,750
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

59
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,336
Hamstrung? How marvellous!
I wish I'd been here.

60
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:43,172
I'll take him.
Let's look at some of the others.

61
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,723
Come along!

62
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:58,831
In spite of sickness and death,
we will profit 11 ,000 sesterces!

63
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:01,125
Including your commission,
of course.

64
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,587
No, sir.
Without my commission.

65
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,466
Marcellus, there they are.

66
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,011
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

67
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:14,763
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

68
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:21,562
Slaves...

69
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:25,858
you have arrived at the gladiatorial
school of Lentulus Batiatus.

70
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:30,029
Here you will be trained by experts
to fight in pairs to the death.

71
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:32,990
Obviously, you won't be required
to fight to the death here.

72
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,159
That will only be
after you've been sold...

73
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,328
and then for ladies
and gentlemen of quality...

74
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,955
those who appreciate
a fine kill.

75
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,710
A gladiator's like a stallion:
He must be pampered.

76
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:47,004
You'll be oiled, bathed...

77
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:51,133
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

78
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:55,971
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself!

79
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:58,140
You'll be given
your ceremonial caudas.

80
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:00,309
Marcellus, please. There.

81
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,687
Be proud of them.

82
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:07,441
On certain special occasions,
those of you who please me...

83
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:11,153
will even be given
the companionship of a young lady.

84
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,907
Approximately half our graduates...

85
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,952
live for five, ten-- ten years.

86
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:21,330
Some of them
even attain freedom...

87
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,290
and become trainers themselves.

88
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:25,334
Marcellus.

89
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:30,047
I congratulate you.
And may fortune smile on most of you.

90
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:38,180
Marcellus, watch the second
from the right.

91
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:40,808
He's a Thracian. They were going
to kill him for hamstringing a guard.

92
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:45,354
- We'll break him of that.
- Don't overdo it. He has quality.

93
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,279
Next.

94
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,453
Next.

95
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,421
I like you.

96
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,757
I want you
to be my friend.

97
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:17,261
I want to be your friend.

98
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,640
All I ask is that
you get along with me.

99
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,978
What's your name, slave?

100
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,730
Spartacus.

101
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,609
I feel you don't like me.

102
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,284
Give him your sword.

103
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:45,331
Take it!

104
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:55,132
I have a feeling
you want to kill me.

105
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,345
This is the only chance
you'll ever get.

106
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:01,305
Kill me!

107
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:04,975
Don't be afraid, slave.

108
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,269
You have that sword.

109
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:10,147
I only have
this piece of wood!

110
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,568
Are you going
to disobey me?

111
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:21,408
Take his sword.

112
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,787
You're not as stupid
as I thought.

113
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,331
You might even be intelligent.

114
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,792
That's dangerous for slaves.

115
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,961
You just remember...

116
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:35,589
from now on, everything you do,
I'll be watching.

117
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,957
You did the right thing.

118
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,378
Every once in a while, Marcellus likes
to kill a man as an example.

119
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,215
I think he's picked you.
Better watch him.

120
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:24,555
- How long have you been here?
- Six months.

121
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,724
I wish he'd pick me.

122
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:30,060
I want one chance at that pig
before they carry me out!

123
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,563
Quiet!
No talking down there.

124
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,485
You'll get us all in trouble,
just like in the mines.

125
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:46,160
What's your name?

126
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:48,579
You don't want
to know my name.

127
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,290
I don't want
to know your name.

128
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,084
Just a friendly question.

129
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:56,629
Gladiators don't make friends.

130
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:59,381
If we're ever matched
in the arena together...

131
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:01,550
I'll have to kill you.

132
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:32,081
Helena...

133
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:35,501
with Galino.

134
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,340
Patricia...

135
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:44,927
Crixus.

136
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:49,098
Priscilla...

137
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,227
David.

138
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:58,816
Claudia...

139
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,569
Pharox.

140
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,908
Varinia...

141
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:11,829
- Dionysius.
- No, no. Spartacus.

142
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:16,458
Spartacus.

143
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,131
Felicia--

144
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:33,369
I've never had a woman.

145
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,730
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.

146
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,941
- Go away.
- What will she think of you?

147
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:06,110
Indeed, what will I think of you?

148
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:08,320
Go away.

149
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:12,783
Come, come. Be generous.
We must learn to share our pleasures.

150
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:16,954
I'm not an animal!

151
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:20,207
You're not trying to escape,
by any chance?

152
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:23,002
Direct your courage
to the girl, Spartacus.

153
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:27,840
I'm not an animal!

154
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:37,057
- I'm not an animal.
- Neither am I.

155
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:15,554
What's your name?

156
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,767
Varinia.

157
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,355
You'll have to take her
out of here, Marcellus.

158
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:26,524
You may not be
an animal, Spartacus...

159
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:29,151
but this sorry show
gives me very little hope...

160
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:32,154
that you'll ever be a man.

161
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:19,470
First rule:

162
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,597
You get an instant kill
on the red.

163
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,266
Here. Here.

164
00:25:25,518 --> 00:25:27,603
Always remember:
Go for the red first...

165
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:30,648
because if you don't,
your opponent will.

166
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,983
In the blue,
you get a cripple.

167
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:35,861
Here, here...

168
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:37,863
here and here.

169
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:41,158
Second rule:

170
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:43,702
Go for the cripple
before the slow kill.

171
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:45,871
Here's a slow kill
on the yellow.

172
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:49,834
Here, here...

173
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,669
and here.

174
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,379
Remember...

175
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:56,882
A slow kill may have enough left
in him to kill you before he dies.

176
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:59,051
With a cripple,
you know you've got him...

177
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:00,970
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

178
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:04,098
The rest is all right
for a public spectacle in Rome...

179
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:07,518
but here at Capua we expect
more than simple butchery...

180
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,687
and we get it.

181
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:14,942
Spartacus, why are you looking
at that girl?

182
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,028
Varinia! Stand still.

183
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:27,121
Since all he can do
is look at girls...

184
00:26:27,204 --> 00:26:30,249
all right, slave,
go ahead and look.

185
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,587
I said look!

186
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:18,255
No. No, this one
goes to the Spaniard.

187
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,015
Have a good night's rest,
Spartacus.

188
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:36,982
In there.

189
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,154
Woman!

190
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,322
I've warned you
about this kind of thing.

191
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,663
All right, bring them in.

192
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:55,561
No talking!
Move along there.

193
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,668
Did they hurt you?

194
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:08,926
No.

195
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:53,012
That's a kill.

196
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:55,306
One, two...

197
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:58,309
three, four, five.

198
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:02,730
One, two, three, four.

199
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,080
We have visitors.
Tremendous visitors!

200
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:04,416
Two simply enormous Roman lords
on the hill.

201
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,627
How easily impressed
you are, Ramon.

202
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,796
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

203
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,006
Tell them to wait for me
when they arrive.

204
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,301
-Master, you don't understand!
-How enormous do these Roman lords get?

205
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:17,388
One of them is
Marcus Licinius Crassus.

206
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:19,473
What? Wait a minute.

207
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:22,977
Crassus here? Varinia,
my red toga with the acorns.

208
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,896
And some chairs in the atrium.
Second-best wine.

209
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,899
No, the best,
but small goblets.

210
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:31,068
Gracchus! You know
how Crassus loathes him.

211
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:35,030
Take him away.

212
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:38,617
- I can't lift it.
- Use your imagination! Cover him.

213
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:41,203
Tell Marcellus
to get the men ready.

214
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:43,622
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show of some sort.

215
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:45,833
Forgive me, Gracchus.

216
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:13,068
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

217
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:15,029
most noble radiance...

218
00:33:15,112 --> 00:33:17,448
first general of the Republic...

219
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:20,242
father and defender of Rome...

220
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:23,871
honour my house.
Bless it with your presence.

221
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:37,551
Wine! Sweetmeats! Can't you see
that Their Honours are exhausted?

222
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,224
Have the goodness to sit.

223
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:50,523
Is anything wrong,
Your Nobility?

224
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:53,484
No.

225
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:56,612
Welcome
to the Lady Claudia Maria...

226
00:33:56,695 --> 00:34:00,449
former wife
of Lucius Caius Marius...

227
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:04,662
whose recent execution
touched us all so deeply.

228
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:06,747
Honour to the Lady Helena...

229
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:09,458
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus...

230
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:13,170
whose fame shall live on forever
in the person of his son...

231
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:18,425
your brother,
Marcus Publius Glabrus...

232
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:20,636
hero of the Eastern Wars.

233
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,013
How very much he knows.

234
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:25,474
Allow me to bring you
up to date.

235
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:29,311
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

236
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:32,148
A mating of eagles,
Your Sanctity!

237
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:34,483
Fan His Magnitude.
He sweats.

238
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:37,945
My young friends desire
a private showing of two pairs.

239
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:40,197
Two pairs. Oh, yes.

240
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:43,200
I think I have something
that would please them.

241
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:47,329
- Two pairs to the death.
- To the death, Your Ladyship?

242
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:52,209
Surely you don't think we came
all the way to Capua for gymnastics?

243
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:55,254
But I beg Your Honours.

244
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:59,091
Here in Capua we train
the finest gladiators in all Italy.

245
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:01,260
We can give you a display
of swordsmanship...

246
00:35:01,343 --> 00:35:04,013
which is better than anything
you can see in Rome at any cost.

247
00:35:04,096 --> 00:35:06,932
When they're sold, their new masters
may do with them as they wish...

248
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:10,394
but here, no, we never fight them
to the death.

249
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:12,938
Crassus.

250
00:35:13,022 --> 00:35:15,107
Today is an exception.

251
00:35:15,191 --> 00:35:19,236
But the ill feeling it would spread
through the whole school.

252
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,448
And then the cost. The cost!

253
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:24,617
Name your price.

254
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:29,371
25,000 sesterces.

255
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,208
Arrange it.

256
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,877
Are you serious, sir?

257
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:38,005
Arrange it immediately.

258
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,218
Of course, we shall want
to choose them ourselves.

259
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:45,513
You do have a certain variety,
don't you?

260
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:47,515
Yes. Inexhaustible.

261
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:58,317
Spartacus, there's going to be
a fight to the death.

262
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,152
- To the death?
- How do you know?

263
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:02,571
I heard Marcellus
tell one of his guards.

264
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:04,782
- Who fights?
- I don't know.

265
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:09,870
To the death.

266
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:14,708
What if they matched
you and me?

267
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:17,711
They won't.

268
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:20,047
What if they did?

269
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,216
Would you fight?

270
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:26,637
I'd have to. So would you.

271
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:29,682
Would you try to kill me?

272
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,435
Yes, I'd kill.

273
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:35,688
I'd try to save--

274
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,774
I'd try to stay alive
and so would you.

275
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:41,694
All gladiators
up to the training area.

276
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:44,363
Some visitors
want to admire you.

277
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:51,203
Form a line
right here in front of me.

278
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:55,541
Would Your Excellencies care
to make your selection now?

279
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,211
Claudia.

280
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:10,306
They're magnificent.

281
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:12,474
For you, Lady Helena...

282
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:15,603
may I suggest Praxus?

283
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:18,522
A veritable tiger.

284
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:22,026
I don't like him.

285
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:30,201
- I prefer that one.
- Which one?

286
00:37:31,368 --> 00:37:33,245
David?

287
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:36,790
Crixus, yes.

288
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:39,793
Marcellus, Crixus
for the short sword.

289
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:46,509
Have you ever seen such a pair
of shoulders? Dionysius!

290
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:52,473
I admit he's small, but he's very
compact and extremely strong.

291
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:54,433
In fact, he looks--

292
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:58,312
He looks smaller here
than he does in the actual arena.

293
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,066
Optical.

294
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:05,861
- Give me that one.
- Galino.

295
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:07,988
Yes, yes. Galino.

296
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:12,243
You have a shrewd eye, Your Pulchritude,
if I may permit myself the--

297
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:18,958
Practically every man in this school
is an expert with a Thracian sword...

298
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:22,169
but the trident is something
very rare these days.

299
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:24,505
May I suggest...

300
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:27,550
the Ethiopian?

301
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:32,304
There are very few Ethiopians
in the country.

302
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:36,308
Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

303
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:44,608
I'll take him.

304
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:48,195
Draba? Oh, no.
For you I want only the best--

305
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:51,198
I want the most beautiful.

306
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:53,367
I'll take the big black one.

307
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,870
Very good.

308
00:38:58,164 --> 00:39:00,291
Only one man
in the entire school...

309
00:39:00,374 --> 00:39:05,588
stands a chance with the Thracian knife
against the trident.

310
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:07,715
There.

311
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:10,467
- Over there, Lady Helena.
- He's impertinent!

312
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:15,931
- I'll take him.
- Impertinent, and a coward to boot.

313
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,058
Have him flogged!

314
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:22,021
Over there, Lady Helena.
The beast of Libya.

315
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:25,566
I prefer the coward.

316
00:39:28,819 --> 00:39:31,530
If both men are down
and refuse to continue to fight...

317
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:33,741
your trainer will slit their throats
like chickens.

318
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:37,369
- We want no tricks.
- Tricks? At the school of Batiatus?

319
00:39:37,453 --> 00:39:41,457
You heard the instruction, Marcellus?
Remember it.

320
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,877
I feel so sorry for the poor things
in all this heat.

321
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,546
Don't put them
in those suffocating tunics.

322
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,216
Let them wear just enough
for modesty.

323
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:53,719
Whatever they wear, Lady,
they'll bless your name.

324
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:57,097
Back, the rest ofyou!

325
00:39:57,181 --> 00:40:00,226
- Our choosing has bored you?
- No.

326
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:02,436
Most exciting. I tingle.

327
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,605
Do let's get out of the sun.

328
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:08,442
May I conduct Your Magnificences
to the gallery now?

329
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,873
An eavesdropper.
Oh, the god!

330
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:28,087
How far from Rome must I go
to avoid that cunning face?

331
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,423
Crassus, don't talk about Gracchus.
He's so hateful.

332
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:34,009
For Gracchus, hatred of the patrician
class is a profession...

333
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:36,178
and not such a bad one, either.

334
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:38,514
How else can one become
master of the mob...

335
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:40,933
and first senator of Rome?

336
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:43,644
Crassus, it's so boring.

337
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:51,110
I believe that girl smells
of perfume.

338
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:54,947
Whatever it is,
she smells most delectable.

339
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,617
You can't keep slaves from stealing
these days unless you chain them.

340
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:01,787
When a slave's as pretty as she is,
she doesn't have to steal.

341
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:04,165
An arrangement is made.

342
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:06,959
If her ankles are good...

343
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:10,129
you could be sure
an arrangement was made!

344
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:16,010
- Master!
- Good heavens, a catastrophe!

345
00:41:16,093 --> 00:41:18,345
- I've been anointed!
- You trollop!

346
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:22,057
- I believe you did that on purpose.
- It was an accident. Come here, girl.

347
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:29,398
Don't be frightened.

348
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:32,526
- What country are you from?
- Britannia.

349
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,046
How long have you been
a slave?

350
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:40,850
Since I was thirteen.

351
00:41:41,994 --> 00:41:44,371
You have a certain education.

352
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:47,583
My first master had me tutored
for his children.

353
00:41:53,756 --> 00:41:57,635
I like her. She has spirit.

354
00:41:57,718 --> 00:42:00,513
- I'll buy her.
- Buy her, Your Magnificence?

355
00:42:00,596 --> 00:42:03,015
I have spent
quite a lot of money on her.

356
00:42:03,098 --> 00:42:05,434
Yes, I've no doubt of it.
Two thousand sesterces.

357
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:07,812
Two thou--
She'll be waiting at your litter.

358
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:10,356
No, I don't want her feet
spoilt by walking.

359
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,110
Send her to Rome with your steward
the next time he has to go there.

360
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:17,279
He leaves tomorrow
and the girl with him.

361
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:21,534
More wine.
And thank your gods!

362
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:24,161
You provoke me, Crassus.
I shan't be nice to you any more!

363
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:27,373
- Why distress me so much?
- You're horribly rich.

364
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:29,500
Yet you're the only one
of my brother's friends...

365
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:32,753
who hasn't given him
a wedding present.

366
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:39,301
I was saving it
for a more suitable moment.

367
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:42,471
Here. Give it to him, child.

368
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:44,487
What is it?

369
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:48,269
As from this moment, your husband
is commander of the garrison of Rome.

370
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,939
Wonderful!

371
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:57,278
I don't know how I shall
ever be able to repay you.

372
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:59,488
Time will solve that mystery.

373
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,910
- The garrison of Rome.
- Yes.

374
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:08,873
The only power in Rome strong enough
to checkmate Gracchus and his senate.

375
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:11,041
You are clever!

376
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:25,063
Open up.

377
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:48,003
Through that door.

378
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,478
But you will have
to watch him, Claudia.

379
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:07,064
Father almost disinherited him
because of slave girls.

380
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:10,818
The marriage contract
absolutely forbids a harem.

381
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:14,029
What about your litter bearers?

382
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:16,323
After all, every one of them
is under 20...

383
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:18,534
and taller than they should be.

384
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:21,161
She sets rather a high standard
for you, does she?

385
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,956
Your pleasure, Your Highness.

386
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:29,962
To you, my dear, shall go the honour
of starting this poetic drama.

387
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,300
Open up!

388
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:43,350
First pair:
Crixus and Galino!

389
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:04,872
Those who are about to die
salute you.

390
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,847
Crixus.

391
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:56,525
Next pair!

392
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:21,341
Those who are about to die,
salute you.

393
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,731
Your Thracian's doing well.

394
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:21,318
How were you able to get my appointment
without Gracchus knowing?

395
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:25,280
I fought fire with oil.
I purchased the senate behind his back.

396
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:27,825
I still think
the trident's going to win.

397
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,664
- Why doesn't he kill him?
- Kill him.

398
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,335
What's the matter now?

399
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:06,256
- Kill him!
- Kill him, you imbecile!

400
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:56,604
He'll hang there till he rots.

401
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:33,284
Take a last look, Spartacus.

402
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:35,328
She's going to Rome.
She's been sold.

403
00:53:38,497 --> 00:53:40,624
She's been sold?

404
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:45,338
No talking
in the kitchen, slave.

405
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:43,062
There's trouble in the mess hall.
They killed Marcellus and maybe others.

406
00:54:43,145 --> 00:54:45,231
Call out the guard!

407
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:47,525
Move, move!

408
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,321
On second thoughts,
I'll deliver the girl personally.

409
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:55,574
Ride to Capua. Call out the garrison.
I don't trust this lot.

410
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:58,244
- I hold you responsible.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:56,672
Around Capua,
they ravaged the countryside...

412
00:57:56,756 --> 00:57:59,133
forcing other slaves to join them.

413
00:57:59,216 --> 00:58:02,762
Looting, robbing,
burning everything...

414
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:08,601
while they make their camp
in the escarpments of Vesuvius.

415
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:12,063
Each day swells their numbers.

416
00:58:12,146 --> 00:58:15,191
The situation presently lies
in the hands...

417
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:17,360
of this august body.

418
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:22,573
Where's the mighty Crassus?

419
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:25,826
- Out of the city.
- At least you're here.

420
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,288
No need to fear for Rome
as long as Glabrus is with us.

421
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:34,210
Let me add: Over 100 estates
have been burned...

422
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:37,254
among them, gentlemen,
my own...

423
00:58:37,338 --> 00:58:41,884
burned to the ground
and three million sesterces lost.

424
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:46,472
I propose the immediate recall
of Pompey and his legions from Spain.

425
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:50,434
- I could bring them in with 500 men!
- Don't make a fool of yourself.

426
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:54,647
Why call back the legions...

427
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,274
when the garrison of Rome
has nothing to do...

428
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,320
but to defend us
from sausage makers?

429
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,531
Let's send Glabrus
against these scoundrels!

430
00:59:03,614 --> 00:59:05,700
Give 'em a taste of Roman steel.

431
00:59:09,578 --> 00:59:12,748
I protest.
I most strongly protest.

432
00:59:12,832 --> 00:59:14,917
There are more slaves
in Rome than Romans.

433
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:19,588
With the garrison absent,
what's to prevent them from rising too?

434
00:59:19,672 --> 00:59:22,925
I did not say
the whole garrison.

435
00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:25,553
Six cohorts will
more than do the job.

436
00:59:25,636 --> 00:59:29,265
The rest can stay in Rome
to save you from your housemaids.

437
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:33,644
Will you accept
such a charge, Glabrus?

438
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:41,527
I accept the charge
of the senate...

439
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,280
if the senate truly charges me.

440
00:59:45,156 --> 00:59:48,367
The garrison of Rome
stands ready.

441
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:55,833
Slave hunting's a dirty business.

442
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:58,085
It takes a brave commander
to consent to it.

443
00:59:58,169 --> 01:00:00,254
I propose we turn
the city out tomorrow...

444
01:00:00,338 --> 01:00:03,132
in tribute to Glabrus
as he marches through.

445
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:07,928
And...

446
01:00:08,012 --> 01:00:11,223
for temporary command
of the garrison during his absence...

447
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,894
I propose Caius Julius Caesar.

448
01:00:30,284 --> 01:00:34,163
You don't look very happy
over the new job.

449
01:00:34,246 --> 01:00:36,999
It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.

450
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:39,460
Maybe.

451
01:00:39,543 --> 01:00:41,629
At least it gives me a chance...

452
01:00:41,712 --> 01:00:44,340
to separate Glabrus
from Crassus for a while.

453
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:49,345
You know, this republic of ours
is something like a rich widow.

454
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,639
Most Romans love her
as their mother.

455
01:00:51,722 --> 01:00:55,643
But Crassus dreams of marrying
the old girl, to put it politely.

456
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,980
Hail Glabrus!
Hail Glabrus!

457
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:08,614
- God be with you, Glabrus.
- And with you too.

458
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:17,999
I hope he returns
to such applause.

459
01:01:18,082 --> 01:01:20,710
One fat one, Fimbria!

460
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,843
No, keep the change.
Give it to your wife.

461
01:01:28,926 --> 01:01:32,930
- May the gods adore you.
- Only through your prayers.

462
01:01:33,014 --> 01:01:37,393
Let's make an old-fashioned sacrifice
for Glabrus' success.

463
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:39,520
I thought you had reservations
about the gods.

464
01:01:39,603 --> 01:01:41,897
Privately I believe in none of them.
Neither do you.

465
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:44,066
Publicly I believe in them all.

466
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,485
Greetings, Marcus Clodius Flavius!

467
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,975
Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?

468
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:20,353
- He awaits you in the atrium, sir.
- Excellent.

469
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,523
What have we here?

470
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,901
A gift from the governor
of Sicily, sir.

471
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,876
Antoninus.

472
01:02:43,959 --> 01:02:46,921
Sicilian, age 26.

473
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:49,423
Singer of songs.

474
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:52,009
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

475
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:54,470
For the children of my master...

476
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:56,722
whom I also taught
the classics.

477
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:59,100
Classics, indeed.

478
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:04,188
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

479
01:03:05,606 --> 01:03:07,692
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.

480
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,819
All of you, come with me.

481
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:27,003
Are you on guard duty?

482
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:32,300
My dear Crassus,
congratulate me.

483
01:03:32,383 --> 01:03:36,012
Or better still,
let us congratulate each other.

484
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,639
I congratulate us.

485
01:03:38,723 --> 01:03:41,142
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts
of the garrison...

486
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:43,311
against the slaves on Vesuvius.

487
01:03:43,394 --> 01:03:45,771
The whole city
is turning out to see us off.

488
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,441
Great merciful
bloodstained gods!

489
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:51,277
Your pardon.

490
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,156
I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

491
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:58,075
Did Gracchus have something
to do with this brilliant affair?

492
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:01,662
Yes, he even proposed it.
Rather decently, too.

493
01:04:01,746 --> 01:04:04,498
And you? Do you think I made you
commander of the garrison...

494
01:04:04,582 --> 01:04:08,002
to control some rock patch
on Vesuvius?

495
01:04:08,085 --> 01:04:10,171
It was to control
the streets of Rome!

496
01:04:10,254 --> 01:04:14,133
I only take six cohorts.
The rest of the garrison remains.

497
01:04:14,216 --> 01:04:16,636
- Under whose command?
- Under Caesar's.

498
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,472
Excellent, excellent!

499
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:22,016
Finding Gracchus in control
of the mob and the senate...

500
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:25,728
you felt compelled to hand over
the garrison to him also.

501
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:28,898
I see.

502
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:32,610
I'll refuse. I'll withdraw
from the expedition.

503
01:04:32,693 --> 01:04:34,779
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician...

504
01:04:34,862 --> 01:04:37,490
is that occasionally
you're obliged to act like one.

505
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,742
You pledged the senate to go,
and go you must.

506
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:42,119
If Gracchus should decide
to move against you--

507
01:04:42,203 --> 01:04:44,372
He won't!
Has no need to.

508
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:48,209
He has, with your assistance,
immobilized me altogether.

509
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:52,046
Your legions are still in camp
outside the city walls?

510
01:04:53,506 --> 01:04:55,591
My legions?

511
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:58,219
Do you truly believe I'd order
my legions to enter Rome?

512
01:04:58,302 --> 01:05:00,930
I only point out that
you can if you have to.

513
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:03,474
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law...

514
01:05:03,557 --> 01:05:06,769
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

515
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:10,690
- Sulla did.
- Sulla? To the infamy of his name!

516
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:13,359
To the utter damnation
of his line!

517
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:16,654
No, my young friend.

518
01:05:17,822 --> 01:05:21,826
One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

519
01:05:21,909 --> 01:05:26,497
I shall restore all the traditions
that made her great.

520
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,417
It follows, then, that I cannot come
to power or even defend myself...

521
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,587
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of them all.

522
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:37,425
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

523
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:41,262
I shall not violate Rome...

524
01:05:41,345 --> 01:05:43,597
at the moment
of possessing her.

525
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:48,185
Go.

526
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,731
Prepare your troops
at once.

527
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:56,152
March out of Rome tonight,
but the city tribute is impossible.

528
01:05:56,235 --> 01:06:00,281
We've already been made to look a fool.
Let's not add the trappings of a clown.

529
01:06:00,364 --> 01:06:04,452
Leave by unfrequented streets,
without fanfare, without even a drum!

530
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:07,997
Sneak out.

531
01:06:09,415 --> 01:06:11,542
As you wish.

532
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:13,961
And for heaven's sake,
my young friend...

533
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:17,465
try and see to it that you don't have
to sneak back again.

534
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:20,343
Farewell.

535
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,906
Come on, fat boy!

536
01:09:31,659 --> 01:09:33,744
Noble Romans...

537
01:09:33,828 --> 01:09:36,163
fighting each other
like animals!

538
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,583
Your new masters,
betting to see who'll die first.

539
01:09:43,087 --> 01:09:45,172
Drop your swords.

540
01:09:51,846 --> 01:09:55,558
I want to see their blood
right over here where Draba died!

541
01:09:57,768 --> 01:10:00,021
When I fight matched pairs,
they fight to the death.

542
01:10:02,356 --> 01:10:04,984
I made myself a promise, Crixus.

543
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:07,153
I swore that
if I ever got out of this place...

544
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:10,698
I'd die before I'd watch
two men fight to the death again.

545
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,370
Draba made that promise too.

546
01:10:17,705 --> 01:10:19,790
He kept it.

547
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,917
So will I.

548
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:28,090
Go on. Get out!

549
01:10:31,344 --> 01:10:33,429
What are we, Crixus?

550
01:10:33,512 --> 01:10:36,098
What are we becoming?
Romans?

551
01:10:36,182 --> 01:10:38,809
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?

552
01:10:38,893 --> 01:10:41,479
We look for wine
when we should be hunting bread.

553
01:10:41,562 --> 01:10:44,482
When you've got wine,
you don't need bread!

554
01:10:45,858 --> 01:10:48,736
You can't just be a gang
of drunken raiders.

555
01:10:48,819 --> 01:10:52,657
- What else can we be?
- Gladiators!

556
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,076
An army of gladiators.

557
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:57,370
There's never been
an army like that.

558
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,247
One gladiator's worth
any two Roman soldiers that ever lived.

559
01:11:00,331 --> 01:11:02,667
We beat the Roman guards,
but a Roman army's a different thing.

560
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,835
They fight different
than we do too.

561
01:11:04,919 --> 01:11:08,839
We can beat anything they send
against us if we really want to.

562
01:11:08,923 --> 01:11:11,717
- It takes a big army for that.
- We'll have a big army.

563
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:13,844
Once we're on the march...

564
01:11:13,928 --> 01:11:16,138
we'll free every slave
in every town and village.

565
01:11:16,222 --> 01:11:18,307
Can anybody get
a bigger army than that?

566
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:20,309
Once we cross the Alps,
we're safe!

567
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:23,771
Nobody can cross the Alps. Every pass
is defended by its own legion.

568
01:11:23,854 --> 01:11:26,774
There's only one way
to get out of this country.

569
01:11:27,274 --> 01:11:28,943
The sea.

570
01:11:29,026 --> 01:11:31,821
What good is the sea
if you have no ships?

571
01:11:31,904 --> 01:11:34,532
The Cilician pirates have ships.

572
01:11:34,615 --> 01:11:37,076
They're at war with Rome.

573
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,287
Every Roman galley that sails
out of Brundusium pays tribute to them.

574
01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:42,456
They've got the biggest fleet
in the world.

575
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:45,710
I was a galley slave with them. They'll
take you anywhere for enough gold.

576
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:47,670
We haven't got enough gold.

577
01:11:47,753 --> 01:11:50,131
Take every Roman we capture
and warm his back a little.

578
01:11:50,214 --> 01:11:53,801
- We'll have gold, all right.
- Spartacus is right!

579
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:58,180
Let's hire these pirates
and march straight to Brundusium!

580
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:48,022
Come join us.
All ofyou, come join us.

581
01:13:05,831 --> 01:13:08,084
Come on and join us!

582
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,236
Back to Vesuvius!

583
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,675
Varinia.

584
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,975
I thought
I'd never see you again.

585
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:22,325
Everything's so different.

586
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:30,499
The last time I saw you...

587
01:14:31,584 --> 01:14:35,296
you were waiting
in the arena to--

588
01:14:42,595 --> 01:14:44,805
I thought
you were in Rome.

589
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,562
How'd you escape?

590
01:14:54,315 --> 01:14:56,317
I jumped out of the cart...

591
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,527
and Batiatus was so fat--

592
01:15:09,497 --> 01:15:12,249
I flew out of the cart...

593
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,003
and Batiatus was so fat...

594
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:18,214
that he couldn't catch me.

595
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:21,175
He couldn't catch up with me.

596
01:15:21,926 --> 01:15:23,970
Do you realize...

597
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:27,098
nobody can ever sell you again?

598
01:15:27,181 --> 01:15:29,266
Nobody can sell you.

599
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:31,602
- Or give you away.
- Or give you away.

600
01:15:31,686 --> 01:15:33,854
Nobody can ever make you
stay with anybody.

601
01:15:33,938 --> 01:15:36,857
Nobody can make you
stay with anybody.

602
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,196
I love you, Spartacus.

603
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,661
I love you.

604
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:54,375
I still can't believe it.

605
01:15:56,335 --> 01:16:00,423
Forbid me ever to leave you.

606
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:08,389
I do forbid you.

607
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,892
I forbid you.

608
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:45,301
It was funny at the time.
I wish he'd heard it.

609
01:16:45,384 --> 01:16:47,678
How good you are to me,
if I may say so.

610
01:16:47,762 --> 01:16:50,306
- You may.
- Thank you.

611
01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:52,475
Don't just eye those birds.
Eat them.

612
01:16:52,558 --> 01:16:55,519
There's no need to be
on your best behaviour here.

613
01:16:55,603 --> 01:16:58,189
May I remind you...

614
01:16:58,272 --> 01:17:00,358
you've been very good to me
in the past?

615
01:17:00,441 --> 01:17:02,526
I've been good to you?

616
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:08,532
Yes. You've sold me slaves
at an extremely reasonable price.

617
01:17:08,616 --> 01:17:12,662
And you arranged private gladiatorial
jousts at cost, or practically.

618
01:17:12,745 --> 01:17:15,081
On the whole, you are both
ethical in business matters...

619
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:19,126
and certainly farsighted socially.

620
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,545
Zenobia's put on a little weight
since I last saw her.

621
01:17:21,629 --> 01:17:24,715
- Yes, hasn't she? I like it.
- So do I.

622
01:17:25,883 --> 01:17:28,219
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

623
01:17:28,302 --> 01:17:32,056
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

624
01:17:32,139 --> 01:17:36,519
Have you noticed the nastiest
of tyrants are invariably thin?

625
01:17:37,937 --> 01:17:42,233
In spite of your vices, you are
the most generous Roman of our time.

626
01:17:42,316 --> 01:17:44,360
Vices?

627
01:17:45,695 --> 01:17:47,571
The ladies.

628
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:53,202
Ladies!
Since when are they a vice?

629
01:17:53,285 --> 01:17:57,123
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

630
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,625
I hope I pronounced that word--

631
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:02,712
It's well-known that even your groom
and your butler are women.

632
01:18:02,795 --> 01:18:05,548
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.

633
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:09,010
I keep these women
out of my respect for Roman morality.

634
01:18:09,093 --> 01:18:11,971
That morality, which has made
Rome strong enough to steal...

635
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:14,223
two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners...

636
01:18:14,307 --> 01:18:17,435
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

637
01:18:17,518 --> 01:18:19,603
I happen to like women.

638
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:22,064
I have a promiscuous nature...

639
01:18:22,148 --> 01:18:24,650
and, unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow...

640
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:26,944
which I know my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

641
01:18:27,028 --> 01:18:30,573
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

642
01:18:30,656 --> 01:18:32,783
Exactly.

643
01:18:32,867 --> 01:18:36,996
It must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity.

644
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:42,460
It is.

645
01:18:42,543 --> 01:18:46,839
Now, let's mix business with pleasure.
How may I help you?

646
01:18:48,716 --> 01:18:51,677
Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate...

647
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,804
but there's one man I can't think of
without fuming.

648
01:18:53,888 --> 01:18:55,765
- Who's that?
- Crassus.

649
01:18:55,848 --> 01:18:59,685
- You've grown ambitious in your hatred.
- Do you blame me?

650
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:02,271
There I was, better than
a millionaire in the morning...

651
01:19:02,355 --> 01:19:04,482
and a penniless refugee
by nightfall...

652
01:19:04,565 --> 01:19:06,817
with nothing but these rags
and my poor flesh to call my own.

653
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:10,196
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua...

654
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:13,616
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs!

655
01:19:13,699 --> 01:19:17,870
These two daughters of Venus
had to taunt the gladiators...

656
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:21,040
force them to fight to the death,
and before I knew what had happened...

657
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:24,377
revolution on my hands!

658
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,545
What revenge have you in mind?

659
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,383
I sold Crassus this woman,
Varinia.

660
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:34,303
- Whom?
- Varinia. May the gods give her wings.

661
01:19:34,387 --> 01:19:37,473
There was no contract,
but she was clearly his slave...

662
01:19:37,556 --> 01:19:39,725
as soon as
the deal was made.

663
01:19:39,809 --> 01:19:42,186
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

664
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:46,482
And Crassus--
no mention of money, no!

665
01:19:46,565 --> 01:19:48,734
You never offered me
this woman. Why not?

666
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:52,655
Well, she's not remotely
your type, Gracchus.

667
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:56,117
- She is very thin and--
- Look around you.

668
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,286
You'll see women of all sizes.

669
01:20:00,705 --> 01:20:03,416
Five hundred sesterces
deposit on Varinia.

670
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:06,127
Since he hasn't paid,
this gives me first call over Crassus...

671
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,337
when she's caught and auctioned.

672
01:20:08,421 --> 01:20:11,257
May the gods adore you!

673
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,384
Why would you buy a woman
you've never even seen?

674
01:20:13,467 --> 01:20:15,553
To annoy Crassus, of course,
and to help you.

675
01:20:23,602 --> 01:20:25,730
Fetch a stool, Antoninus.

676
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:33,946
In here with it.

677
01:20:40,494 --> 01:20:42,371
That will do.

678
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:51,047
Do you steal, Antoninus?

679
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:53,049
No, master.

680
01:20:53,507 --> 01:20:55,593
Do you lie?

681
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,095
Not if I can avoid it.

682
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:02,808
Have you ever
dishonoured the gods?

683
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,769
No, master.

684
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:10,399
Do you refrain from these vices
out of respect for the moral virtues?

685
01:21:10,483 --> 01:21:12,360
Yes, master.

686
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:18,532
Do you eat oysters?

687
01:21:18,616 --> 01:21:20,701
When I have them, master.

688
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,496
Do you eat snails?

689
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,957
No, master.

690
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:29,835
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral...

691
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:32,546
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

692
01:21:34,382 --> 01:21:36,592
No, master.

693
01:21:36,676 --> 01:21:38,761
Of course not.

694
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,392
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

695
01:21:44,475 --> 01:21:46,352
Yes, master.

696
01:21:47,186 --> 01:21:50,272
And taste is not
the same as appetite...

697
01:21:50,356 --> 01:21:53,943
and therefore not a question
of morals, is it?

698
01:21:59,407 --> 01:22:02,159
It could be argued so, master.

699
01:22:04,996 --> 01:22:08,124
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.

700
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:26,475
My taste includes...

701
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:30,271
both snails and oysters.

702
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:41,324
Antoninus, look.

703
01:22:42,283 --> 01:22:44,368
Across the river.

704
01:22:45,244 --> 01:22:47,496
There is something
you must see.

705
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:55,046
There, boy, is Rome!

706
01:22:56,172 --> 01:22:58,758
The might, the majesty...

707
01:22:59,634 --> 01:23:01,886
the terror of Rome.

708
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:08,476
There is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus.

709
01:23:09,644 --> 01:23:11,812
No man can withstand Rome.

710
01:23:12,855 --> 01:23:15,149
No nation can withstand her.

711
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:18,736
How much less...

712
01:23:19,278 --> 01:23:21,197
a boy!

713
01:23:28,037 --> 01:23:30,706
There's only one way to deal
with Rome, Antoninus.

714
01:23:31,999 --> 01:23:34,126
You must serve her.

715
01:23:35,419 --> 01:23:38,547
You must abase yourself
before her.

716
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:43,010
You must grovel at her feet.

717
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:46,764
You must...

718
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,517
love her.

719
01:23:53,187 --> 01:23:55,272
Isn't that so, Antoninus?

720
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:40,920
- Take your time!
- How are they coming?

721
01:25:41,003 --> 01:25:44,423
Good. Give me another thousand like them
and we can march on Rome.

722
01:25:44,507 --> 01:25:46,592
Come on, once again.

723
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:04,151
Here on Vesuvius,
we're safe from attack...

724
01:26:04,235 --> 01:26:06,821
while we organize ourselves
into an army.

725
01:26:06,904 --> 01:26:09,699
It may take six months.
It may take a year. We don't know.

726
01:26:09,782 --> 01:26:13,160
Once we're strong, we're gonna fight
our way south to the sea.

727
01:26:13,244 --> 01:26:16,247
We're going to arrange for ships
with the Cilician pirates.

728
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:19,458
Then the sea will be a road
back home for all of us.

729
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,919
If you agree, you may join us.

730
01:26:22,003 --> 01:26:25,923
If you don't agree, go back
before your escape is discovered.

731
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,302
Too many women.

732
01:26:29,385 --> 01:26:31,470
What's wrong with women?

733
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:33,764
Where would you be now,
you lout...

734
01:26:33,848 --> 01:26:36,142
if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell...

735
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:38,311
to get you
into this accursed world?

736
01:26:38,394 --> 01:26:41,480
I can handle a knife
in the dark as well as anyone.

737
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,816
I can cast spells
and brew poisons.

738
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:47,486
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters in my time.

739
01:26:48,654 --> 01:26:51,532
- You lout! I want to see Spartacus.
- All right, grandmother.

740
01:26:51,615 --> 01:26:54,327
I'm Spartacus. Stay with us.

741
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:57,204
We'll need a million Roman shrouds
before we're through.

742
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,418
Where do you people come from?

743
01:27:02,501 --> 01:27:05,296
Most of us come
from the estate of Lillius.

744
01:27:05,379 --> 01:27:08,716
- What kind ofwork did you do there?
- Sixteen years a carpenter and mason.

745
01:27:08,799 --> 01:27:11,594
Good. We can use carpenters.

746
01:27:13,387 --> 01:27:15,848
- What kind of work did you do?
- I was a chief steward.

747
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:19,602
You'll help with the food supplies.
You'll report to the man Patullus.

748
01:27:19,685 --> 01:27:21,771
What kind of work did you do?

749
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,690
Singer of songs.

750
01:27:25,775 --> 01:27:29,945
Singer of songs?
But what work did you do?

751
01:27:30,029 --> 01:27:32,907
That's my work.
I also juggle.

752
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:35,576
Juggle. What else do you do?

753
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,954
I can do feats of magic.

754
01:27:38,037 --> 01:27:40,414
Magic?

755
01:27:40,498 --> 01:27:42,959
Maybe he can make
the Romans disappear.

756
01:29:10,463 --> 01:29:15,176
I'll need one volunteer,
man or woman. How about you?

757
01:29:16,093 --> 01:29:18,346
Here we have a likely subject.

758
01:29:19,805 --> 01:29:22,975
You'll notice there is
nothing in my hand, true?

759
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:25,144
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

760
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:27,355
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three!

761
01:29:27,438 --> 01:29:29,523
I make a bowl.

762
01:29:29,607 --> 01:29:32,401
My hand is upside down,
and I ask you to blow at it.

763
01:29:32,485 --> 01:29:34,654
No, not hard enough. Hard!

764
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:37,657
Thank you.

765
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:46,791
Would you like to try?

766
01:29:50,169 --> 01:29:52,755
Hit it against the rock, gently.

767
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:04,141
Poet, I haven't had
an egg in days.

768
01:30:04,225 --> 01:30:06,394
You haven't?

769
01:30:09,355 --> 01:30:11,607
- Here.
- Thank you.

770
01:30:11,691 --> 01:30:13,776
I'm not going
to let mine get away.

771
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:37,341
- Sing us a song.
- Sing us a song, Antoninus.

772
01:30:38,175 --> 01:30:40,303
Sing, Antoninus.

773
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:46,183
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky...

774
01:30:48,352 --> 01:30:50,980
when the wind dies away
on the mountain...

775
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:56,736
when the song
of the meadowlark turns still...

776
01:30:59,363 --> 01:31:02,491
when the field locust clicks
no more in the field...

777
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:08,205
and the sea foam sleeps
like a maiden at rest...

778
01:31:08,289 --> 01:31:12,168
and twilight touches the shape
of the wandering earth...

779
01:31:12,251 --> 01:31:15,004
I turn home.

780
01:31:15,087 --> 01:31:18,382
Through blue shadows
and purple woods...

781
01:31:18,466 --> 01:31:20,343
I turn home.

782
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:24,180
I turn to the place
that I was born...

783
01:31:24,263 --> 01:31:28,225
to the mother who bore me
and the father who taught me...

784
01:31:28,309 --> 01:31:30,853
long ago, long ago...

785
01:31:30,936 --> 01:31:33,147
long ago.

786
01:31:34,273 --> 01:31:38,694
Alone am I now, lost and alone,
in a far, wide, wandering world.

787
01:31:40,446 --> 01:31:43,699
Yet still when
the blazing sun hangs low...

788
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:49,205
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps...

789
01:31:50,498 --> 01:31:53,376
and twilight touches
the wandering earth...

790
01:31:55,211 --> 01:31:57,463
I turn home.

791
01:32:02,843 --> 01:32:04,971
Where'd you learn that song?

792
01:32:05,596 --> 01:32:08,099
My father taught it to me.

793
01:32:08,808 --> 01:32:11,185
I was wrong about you, poet.

794
01:32:11,268 --> 01:32:13,396
You won't learn to kill.
You'll teach us songs.

795
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:15,690
I came here to fight.

796
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:20,277
Anyone can learn to fight.

797
01:32:20,361 --> 01:32:22,446
I joined to fight!

798
01:32:25,908 --> 01:32:28,995
- What's your name?
- Antoninus.

799
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:37,295
There's a time for fighting,
and there's a time for singing.

800
01:32:37,378 --> 01:32:39,797
Now you teach us to sing.

801
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,966
Sing, Antoninus.

802
01:32:48,556 --> 01:32:52,518
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky--

803
01:32:53,519 --> 01:32:55,604
You like him, don't you?

804
01:32:59,942 --> 01:33:02,028
Who wants to fight?

805
01:33:04,613 --> 01:33:07,074
An animal can learn to fight.

806
01:33:10,286 --> 01:33:13,080
But to sing beautiful things...

807
01:33:14,165 --> 01:33:16,292
and make people believe them--

808
01:33:26,552 --> 01:33:28,638
What are you thinking about?

809
01:33:36,145 --> 01:33:38,230
I'm free.

810
01:33:39,815 --> 01:33:41,901
And what do I know?

811
01:33:42,443 --> 01:33:44,445
I don't even know
how to read.

812
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:49,492
You know things
that can't be taught.

813
01:33:52,244 --> 01:33:54,330
I know nothing.

814
01:33:54,705 --> 01:33:56,749
Nothing!

815
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,253
And I want to know.

816
01:34:01,671 --> 01:34:03,547
I want to--

817
01:34:05,383 --> 01:34:07,468
I want to know.

818
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,638
Know what?

819
01:34:14,266 --> 01:34:15,935
Everything.

820
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:22,775
Why a star falls
and a bird doesn't.

821
01:34:22,858 --> 01:34:25,569
Where the sun goes at night.

822
01:34:25,653 --> 01:34:28,114
Why the moon changes shape.

823
01:34:32,743 --> 01:34:35,329
I want to know
where the wind comes from.

824
01:34:42,503 --> 01:34:45,923
The wind begins in a cave.

825
01:34:46,007 --> 01:34:50,761
Far to the north,
a young god sleeps in that cave.

826
01:34:50,845 --> 01:34:53,139
He dreams of a girl...

827
01:34:53,222 --> 01:34:55,766
and he sighs...

828
01:34:55,850 --> 01:34:59,812
and the night wind
stirs with his breath.

829
01:35:08,112 --> 01:35:10,865
I want to know all about you.

830
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,162
Every line...

831
01:35:16,996 --> 01:35:19,081
every curve.

832
01:35:22,335 --> 01:35:25,129
I want to know
every part of you.

833
01:35:27,798 --> 01:35:30,051
Every beat of your heart.

834
01:35:55,618 --> 01:35:58,454
Go on about the city
of Metapontum.

835
01:35:58,537 --> 01:36:00,831
What garrisons
will we find there?

836
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:05,419
There are two legions in the garrison.
Some have been sent south--

837
01:36:05,503 --> 01:36:07,588
Set the litter down there.

838
01:36:24,021 --> 01:36:27,608
Where is this slave general?

839
01:36:31,445 --> 01:36:33,823
Dionysius, get the litter bearers
out of the rain.

840
01:36:33,906 --> 01:36:36,534
Give them food, bread,
and their freedom.

841
01:36:38,077 --> 01:36:40,371
- All right, follow me.
- We'll pay you for them.

842
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:44,333
We have no slaves
in this camp.

843
01:36:49,297 --> 01:36:51,716
Tigranes Levantus at your service.

844
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,385
My credentials.

845
01:36:59,056 --> 01:37:00,933
Come in.

846
01:37:03,519 --> 01:37:06,105
"To the general of the Italian slaves
called Spartacus...

847
01:37:06,188 --> 01:37:09,442
from Ibar M'hali, Cilician governor
of the island of Delos."

848
01:37:09,525 --> 01:37:11,569
- Sit down.
- "Greetings.

849
01:37:11,652 --> 01:37:14,196
Word has been received that you wish
to embark your armies...

850
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:18,451
on the Cilician ships
from the Italian port of Brundusium.

851
01:37:18,534 --> 01:37:21,621
- Receive now my agent, Tigranes--"
- Levantus.

852
01:37:21,704 --> 01:37:24,040
"who bargains in my name.

853
01:37:24,123 --> 01:37:28,085
May Isis and Serapis bring victory
to your cause. The governor of Delos."

854
01:37:28,169 --> 01:37:31,547
- Who are Isis and Serapis?
- Gods of the east.

855
01:37:31,631 --> 01:37:34,592
Why should they want us to win?

856
01:37:35,968 --> 01:37:38,179
Because they favour Cilicia...

857
01:37:38,262 --> 01:37:40,348
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

858
01:37:45,102 --> 01:37:47,563
Would you like some wine?

859
01:37:47,647 --> 01:37:50,733
I drink only after the bargain
has been concluded...

860
01:37:50,816 --> 01:37:52,777
never before.

861
01:38:00,242 --> 01:38:02,787
How many ships
do these Cilicians have?

862
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:05,122
Five hundred at least.

863
01:38:05,206 --> 01:38:07,333
But no deal is too small,
I assure you.

864
01:38:07,416 --> 01:38:09,627
We'll need them all.

865
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:12,588
- All?
- What is the price?

866
01:38:13,714 --> 01:38:18,469
Price is 100,000 sesterces
per ship.

867
01:38:19,387 --> 01:38:22,139
For 500 ships that would be...

868
01:38:23,224 --> 01:38:25,810
50 million sesterces.

869
01:38:27,103 --> 01:38:31,482
- You have such a sum?
- We will have.

870
01:38:35,069 --> 01:38:37,154
See for yourself.

871
01:38:40,241 --> 01:38:42,868
- Beautiful.
- When will the ships be ready?

872
01:38:42,952 --> 01:38:47,039
Beautiful.
I love to see such beauty.

873
01:38:47,123 --> 01:38:49,250
When will the ships be ready?

874
01:38:50,126 --> 01:38:52,211
My friend...

875
01:38:52,295 --> 01:38:54,922
when will you be ready?

876
01:38:55,006 --> 01:38:57,425
How long will it take you...

877
01:38:59,176 --> 01:39:01,262
to cross one-third
the length of Italy...

878
01:39:01,345 --> 01:39:03,889
fighting a major battle
in every town?

879
01:39:03,973 --> 01:39:06,434
One year? Two years?

880
01:39:06,517 --> 01:39:08,602
If we're not in Brundusium
seven months from now...

881
01:39:08,686 --> 01:39:11,147
we'll never be there.

882
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,276
What if we assemble the ships...

883
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:20,698
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them?

884
01:39:20,781 --> 01:39:24,327
We'll give you a chest of treasure now,
the rest when we get to Brundusium.

885
01:39:25,202 --> 01:39:27,496
- This one?
- Yes.

886
01:39:28,831 --> 01:39:32,251
Done! Seven months from now,
the ships will be assembled.

887
01:39:34,545 --> 01:39:37,381
Arrange to have the chest loaded.

888
01:39:37,465 --> 01:39:41,302
Now, with your permission, I should
like to have the wine you offered me.

889
01:39:41,385 --> 01:39:43,429
- Will you join me?
- I will.

890
01:39:43,512 --> 01:39:45,473
Excellent workmanship.

891
01:39:45,556 --> 01:39:47,933
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

892
01:39:48,017 --> 01:39:51,062
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

893
01:39:51,145 --> 01:39:53,356
I'm the son
and grandson of slaves.

894
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:57,401
I knew that
when I saw you couldn't read.

895
01:39:57,485 --> 01:40:01,364
Of course, it pleases Roman vanity
to think that you are noble.

896
01:40:01,447 --> 01:40:04,075
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves...

897
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:06,285
especially a man like Crassus.

898
01:40:08,112 --> 01:40:12,950
- You know him?
- I entertained him one afternoon.

899
01:40:13,033 --> 01:40:15,411
- You?
- In the arena.

900
01:40:18,372 --> 01:40:20,457
Excellent wine.

901
01:40:23,669 --> 01:40:26,714
- May I ask you something?
- You can ask.

902
01:40:26,797 --> 01:40:30,301
Surely you know
you're going to lose, don't you?

903
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,637
You have no chance.

904
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:36,307
At this very moment, six cohorts
of the garrison of Rome...

905
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:38,601
are approaching this position.

906
01:40:41,353 --> 01:40:44,356
What are you going to do?

907
01:40:48,569 --> 01:40:51,030
We'll decide that
when they get here.

908
01:40:55,493 --> 01:40:57,661
Let me put it differently.

909
01:40:57,745 --> 01:41:01,040
If you looked
into a magic crystal...

910
01:41:01,123 --> 01:41:05,336
and you saw your army destroyed
and yourself dead...

911
01:41:05,419 --> 01:41:08,130
if you saw that in the future...

912
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:10,257
as I'm sure
you're seeing it now...

913
01:41:10,341 --> 01:41:12,384
would you continue to fight?

914
01:41:13,802 --> 01:41:16,180
- Yes.
- Knowing that you must lose?

915
01:41:18,265 --> 01:41:21,143
Knowing we can.

916
01:41:21,227 --> 01:41:24,396
All men lose when they die
and all men die.

917
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,024
But a slave and a free man
lose different things.

918
01:41:27,107 --> 01:41:28,984
They both lose life.

919
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:32,905
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

920
01:41:33,989 --> 01:41:36,575
A slave loses his pain.

921
01:41:37,827 --> 01:41:40,830
Death is the only freedom
a slave knows.

922
01:41:40,913 --> 01:41:42,998
That's why he's not afraid of it.

923
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:46,418
That's why we'll win.

924
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:18,090
Spartacus,
that pirate was right.

925
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:22,886
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

926
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:26,348
- How many are there?
- About six cohorts.

927
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:29,559
- Where?
- At the mouth of the valley...

928
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,728
against the cliffs.

929
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:37,150
- Strong camp?
- They have no stockade.

930
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:41,863
No stockade? Are you sure?

931
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:45,951
- I'm very sure.
- This campaign is great sport for them.

932
01:42:46,034 --> 01:42:48,120
The Romans are having a picnic.

933
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:52,082
- Did they see you?
- No! We were hidden.

934
01:42:54,876 --> 01:42:57,295
Maybe we ought to join
this Roman picnic.

935
01:42:57,379 --> 01:42:59,506
Form your men.

936
01:43:05,178 --> 01:43:07,055
Six cohorts.

937
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:10,767
A lot of arms and weapons...

938
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:12,936
to build our army with.

939
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:43,175
Crixus always wanted
to march on Rome.

940
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:46,053
Now he doesn't have to.

941
01:43:46,845 --> 01:43:48,930
Rome's come to us.

942
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:57,666
Half this way!
The rest over there.

943
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:21,732
Stand up, the way
a noble Roman should!

944
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,900
That's Roman pride for you!

945
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:32,492
That's better.

946
01:45:32,826 --> 01:45:34,703
What's your name?

947
01:45:36,204 --> 01:45:38,749
Marcus Glabrus.

948
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:43,503
Commander of the garrison
of Rome!

949
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:44,838
Commander?

950
01:45:44,921 --> 01:45:48,967
He was commanding it on his belly
when we found him, playing dead!

951
01:45:52,554 --> 01:45:55,766
You disappoint me,
Marcus Glabrus.

952
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,934
Playing dead.

953
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:01,229
You afraid to die?

954
01:46:02,814 --> 01:46:04,983
It's easy to die.

955
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:07,444
Haven't you seen
enough gladiators in the arena...

956
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:09,613
to see how easy it is to die?

957
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:12,074
Of course you have.

958
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:16,787
What are you going
to do to me?

959
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,955
I don't know.

960
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:24,336
- What should we do with him?
- Let's have a matched pair, him and me.

961
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,799
I'll not fight like a gladiator!

962
01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:36,473
You keep staring at this.

963
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:38,642
Do you recognize this baton?

964
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:43,355
- Yes!
- You should! It was in your tent.

965
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,984
The symbol of the senate.

966
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:50,529
All the power of Rome!

967
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,116
That's the power of Rome!

968
01:46:57,828 --> 01:47:00,288
Take that back to your senate.

969
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:04,376
Tell them you and that broken stick is
all that's left of the garrison of Rome!

970
01:47:04,459 --> 01:47:07,254
Tell them we want nothing
from Rome.

971
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:10,007
Nothing except our freedom!

972
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:13,010
All we want is to get out
of this damn country!

973
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:15,178
We're marching south
to the sea.

974
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:17,723
And we'll smash every army
they send against us.

975
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:20,225
Put him on a horse!

976
01:50:19,821 --> 01:50:23,658
Their leader said
their hatred of Rome was such...

977
01:50:23,741 --> 01:50:26,911
that all they wished
was to escape from her rule.

978
01:50:26,995 --> 01:50:31,040
If unopposed, he promised
a peaceful march to the sea.

979
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:34,544
If opposed, he threatens
to ravage the countryside...

980
01:50:34,627 --> 01:50:36,921
and destroy every legion
sent against him.

981
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:39,048
And once they get to the sea?

982
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:43,136
They plan to take ship with Cilician
pirates and return to their homes.

983
01:50:43,219 --> 01:50:45,847
From which port do they
propose to embark?

984
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:47,932
I don't know.

985
01:50:48,016 --> 01:50:50,768
But city garrisons
can't stand up to them.

986
01:50:50,852 --> 01:50:53,605
If they are to be intercepted,
it's work for the legions!

987
01:50:53,688 --> 01:50:57,609
What sort of a man is
this leader of the slaves?

988
01:50:57,692 --> 01:50:59,694
I don't know.

989
01:50:59,777 --> 01:51:01,988
I think they called him
Spartacus.

990
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:07,410
Is that name familiar to you?

991
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:12,665
Yes, it does seem to be.

992
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:14,626
I can't place it.

993
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:16,836
After he talked to you,
what happened then?

994
01:51:18,463 --> 01:51:21,716
I was tied to a horse
and lashed out of camp.

995
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:26,804
How many ofyour company
escaped?

996
01:51:26,888 --> 01:51:29,140
Fourteen have reported
thus far.

997
01:51:29,224 --> 01:51:32,143
I myself was taken prisoner
in my own command tent.

998
01:51:32,227 --> 01:51:36,481
The camp was thoroughly infiltrated
before an alarm could be sounded.

999
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:42,111
Did you surround your camp
with moat and stockade?

1000
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:50,537
No.

1001
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:56,709
We arrived after sunset.
Sentries were posted every ten paces.

1002
01:51:56,793 --> 01:52:00,255
There was no reason to expect
an attack by night.

1003
01:52:00,338 --> 01:52:03,633
Then again, well, they--

1004
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:07,595
Continue.

1005
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:12,308
They were only slaves.

1006
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:16,729
I see.

1007
01:52:19,732 --> 01:52:23,987
I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus
has disgraced the arms of Rome.

1008
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,866
Let the punishment
of the senate be pronounced.

1009
01:52:32,954 --> 01:52:36,249
If we punished every commander
who made a fool of himself...

1010
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:39,377
we wouldn't have anyone left
above the rank of centurion.

1011
01:52:41,045 --> 01:52:43,840
But this is a case
of criminal carelessness!

1012
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:47,260
Six cohorts have been slaughtered.

1013
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:49,804
Crassus sponsored this young man.

1014
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:52,015
Let him pronounce sentence.

1015
01:52:55,476 --> 01:52:57,562
The punishment is well-known!

1016
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,525
Let Publius Marcus Glabrus
be denied...

1017
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,736
fire, water,
food and shelter...

1018
01:53:04,819 --> 01:53:08,156
for a distance of 400 miles
in all directions from the city of Rome.

1019
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:15,371
One thing more.

1020
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:19,417
Glabrus is my friend, and I will not
dissociate myself from his disgrace.

1021
01:53:19,501 --> 01:53:22,629
I now lay down the command
of my legions...

1022
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:24,714
and retire to private life.

1023
01:53:37,393 --> 01:53:39,270
Good-bye, Crassus.

1024
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:44,901
This is no time for a man of honour
to withdraw from public affairs!

1025
01:53:44,984 --> 01:53:47,987
- Shame, shame!
- Sit down.

1026
01:53:48,696 --> 01:53:52,158
This sort of heroic
public behaviour is nothing new!

1027
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:54,828
I've seen it before-- we all have--
and I know the meaning of it!

1028
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:59,290
- Crassus acted on a point of honour!
- Patrician honour!

1029
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,459
No matter how noble
this looks from the outside...

1030
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:03,628
I don't like the colour of it.

1031
01:54:03,711 --> 01:54:05,797
Crassus is
the only man in Rome...

1032
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:09,884
who hasn't yielded to
republican corruption, and never will!

1033
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:14,013
I'll take some republican corruption
along with some republican freedom...

1034
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:15,974
but I won't take...

1035
01:54:16,057 --> 01:54:20,562
the dictatorship of Crassus
and no freedom at all!

1036
01:54:22,772 --> 01:54:25,108
That's what he's out for...

1037
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:27,277
and that's why he'll be back.

1038
01:58:18,383 --> 01:58:21,511
To the mother that bore me...

1039
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:25,056
to the father that taught me...

1040
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:29,269
to the god--

1041
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:35,316
To the blue woods
and the purple shadows, I--

1042
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,862
To blue shadows
and purple woods.

1043
01:58:38,945 --> 01:58:42,782
- Spartacus, you frightened me!
- I'm sorry.

1044
01:58:44,993 --> 01:58:47,745
- How long have you been there?
- A little while.

1045
01:58:48,788 --> 01:58:50,874
Why didn't you say something?

1046
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:53,084
You seemed so happy.
I didn't want to bother you.

1047
01:58:53,168 --> 01:58:55,295
I am happy.

1048
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:59,465
Spartacus, I've been trying to remember
the song that Antoninus sang.

1049
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:01,926
Is it blue shadows
and purple woods?

1050
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:05,054
Or is it purple woods
and blue shadows, or what is it?

1051
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:07,390
I want to make love
to my wife!

1052
01:59:09,893 --> 01:59:11,936
Spartacus, put me down. I'm--

1053
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:13,938
I don't care.

1054
01:59:14,022 --> 01:59:16,774
- You've got, you've--
- Yes?

1055
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:20,111
- You have to be gentle with me.
- Why?

1056
01:59:20,195 --> 01:59:22,071
Why, darling?

1057
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:25,450
I'm going to have a baby.
Now put me down.

1058
01:59:27,994 --> 01:59:29,662
What?

1059
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:34,417
A baby.

1060
01:59:38,087 --> 01:59:40,173
A baby? When?

1061
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,260
In the spring.

1062
01:59:46,804 --> 01:59:51,476
- How? I mean, how do you know?
- I know.

1063
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:54,729
A baby in the spring.

1064
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:59,526
- I'm gonna have a son.
- But it might be a daughter.

1065
01:59:59,609 --> 02:00:01,820
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did.

1066
02:00:01,903 --> 02:00:04,447
You're cold.
Here, get underneath this.

1067
02:00:05,448 --> 02:00:07,534
- Did I hurt you?
- No, you didn't.

1068
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:10,620
- I didn't mean to be so rough.
- Why don't you kiss me?

1069
02:00:10,703 --> 02:00:13,498
This is the first time
I was ever going to have a baby.

1070
02:00:19,045 --> 02:00:21,297
A baby.

1071
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:24,634
I'm just the same
as I ever was, Spartacus.

1072
02:00:34,686 --> 02:00:36,771
I won't break.

1073
02:01:06,009 --> 02:01:10,430
These sla ves have already cost us
a thousandmillion sesterces.

1074
02:01:10,513 --> 02:01:13,433
If now they want to relieve us
of their unwelcome presence...

1075
02:01:13,516 --> 02:01:15,602
in the name of all the gods,
let them go!

1076
02:01:15,685 --> 02:01:19,063
Impossible! They've already infected
half of Italy with this uprising.

1077
02:01:19,147 --> 02:01:20,899
If we permit them
to escape now...

1078
02:01:20,982 --> 02:01:23,568
this condition will spread
throughout the entire empire.

1079
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:33,453
The Republic...

1080
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:36,789
is still weak
from 20 years of civil strife.

1081
02:01:36,873 --> 02:01:39,792
We're engaged in two wars:

1082
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:43,296
one in Spain
and the other in Asia.

1083
02:01:43,379 --> 02:01:47,383
Pirates have cut off
our Egyptian grain supply...

1084
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:52,222
and Spartacus raids the commerce
of all south Italy.

1085
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:57,101
Half the precincts of Rome
are without bread!

1086
02:01:57,185 --> 02:01:59,979
The city is close to panic.

1087
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:04,317
There are two things
we must do immediately!

1088
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:08,196
Confirm Caesar as permanent
commander of the garrison...

1089
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:14,410
and assign two legions...

1090
02:02:14,494 --> 02:02:19,833
to intercept and destroy Spartacus
at the city of Metapontum!

1091
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:28,401
If we could only have had
Batiatus in the other pot!

1092
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:32,030
- Now you're talking!
- Varinia, wonderful meal.

1093
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:36,659
A small piece of land
with a few goats on it.

1094
02:03:38,286 --> 02:03:40,371
The best wine in the world.

1095
02:03:40,455 --> 02:03:44,959
For wine you've got to go to Aquitania.
The sweetest grapes on earth.

1096
02:03:45,043 --> 02:03:48,296
Come to Lidya for wine.
That's the best.

1097
02:03:48,379 --> 02:03:52,425
The best wine comes from Greece.
Everybody knows that. Even the Romans!

1098
02:03:52,509 --> 02:03:55,178
No, Lidya!

1099
02:03:56,012 --> 02:03:58,765
You're all wrong!

1100
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:01,184
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

1101
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:03,144
I agree with you.

1102
02:04:24,958 --> 02:04:26,835
Gentlemen.

1103
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:30,463
- Are there reports on Metapontum?
- Heralds are crying the news now.

1104
02:04:30,547 --> 02:04:33,800
We lost 1 9,000 men,
including Commodius and his officers.

1105
02:04:33,883 --> 02:04:36,135
Nineteen thousand?

1106
02:04:38,263 --> 02:04:40,473
Have you estates in Metapontum?

1107
02:04:40,557 --> 02:04:43,768
No. A son with Commodius.

1108
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:46,980
With your permission, good day.

1109
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:52,902
We take five years
to train a legion.

1110
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:57,240
How can this Spartacus
train an army in seven months?

1111
02:04:57,323 --> 02:05:00,743
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

1112
02:05:00,827 --> 02:05:03,788
- We should have an investigation.
- By all means, an investigation.

1113
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:08,126
-Where is Spartacus now?
-He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.

1114
02:05:08,209 --> 02:05:10,962
I need a few moments
of the commander's time.

1115
02:05:11,045 --> 02:05:13,131
Will you excuse us?

1116
02:05:18,052 --> 02:05:23,016
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

1117
02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:25,685
Not a very splendid house either.

1118
02:05:25,768 --> 02:05:28,521
And you feasted 1 1 ,000 plebeians
in the field of Mars.

1119
02:05:28,605 --> 02:05:30,857
It scarcely could've
been called a feast.

1120
02:05:31,941 --> 02:05:33,985
For 200 years, your family
and mine have been members...

1121
02:05:34,068 --> 02:05:37,280
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party.

1122
02:05:37,363 --> 02:05:40,366
Servants and rulers of Rome.

1123
02:05:40,450 --> 02:05:42,869
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

1124
02:05:42,952 --> 02:05:46,039
I've left no one,
least of all Rome.

1125
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:49,918
But this much I've learned
from Gracchus: Rome is the mob.

1126
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:52,128
No!

1127
02:05:52,212 --> 02:05:55,840
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

1128
02:05:55,924 --> 02:05:58,009
I had no idea
you'd grown religious.

1129
02:05:58,676 --> 02:06:00,637
That doesn't matter.

1130
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:03,181
If there were no gods at all,
I'd revere them.

1131
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:06,559
If there were no Rome,
I'd dream of her...

1132
02:06:06,643 --> 02:06:08,728
as I want you to do.

1133
02:06:10,146 --> 02:06:12,565
I want you to come back
to your own kind.

1134
02:06:13,191 --> 02:06:15,151
I beg you to.

1135
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:18,071
Is it me you want
or is it the garrison?

1136
02:06:19,531 --> 02:06:22,742
Both. Tell me frankly.

1137
02:06:22,826 --> 02:06:25,662
If you were I, would you
take the field against Spartacus?

1138
02:06:25,745 --> 02:06:27,872
- Of course.
- Why?

1139
02:06:27,956 --> 02:06:30,750
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

1140
02:06:30,834 --> 02:06:32,502
Caesar!

1141
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:34,212
Which Rome?

1142
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:36,089
Theirs...

1143
02:06:36,172 --> 02:06:38,091
or ours?

1144
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:43,513
You know Gracchus
is my friend.

1145
02:06:45,306 --> 02:06:47,392
I won't betray him.

1146
02:06:48,893 --> 02:06:50,770
Caesar.

1147
02:06:54,232 --> 02:06:56,943
Which is worse: to betray a friend
or to betray Rome herself?

1148
02:06:57,026 --> 02:06:59,237
My dear Crassus,
I face no such choice.

1149
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:02,240
You will,
sooner than you think.

1150
02:07:03,867 --> 02:07:06,661
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you all day.

1151
02:07:06,744 --> 02:07:08,621
Your new master.

1152
02:07:11,749 --> 02:07:14,627
The senate's been in session all day
over this business of Spartacus.

1153
02:07:14,711 --> 02:07:18,506
We've got eight legions to march
against him and no one to lead them.

1154
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:20,717
The minute you offer
the generals command...

1155
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:23,052
they start wheezing
like winded mules.

1156
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:25,555
I've seen such epidemics before,
haven't you?

1157
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:27,974
- How's your health?
- Excellent, as you know.

1158
02:07:28,057 --> 02:07:30,643
I take it the senate's now offering
command of the legions to me.

1159
02:07:30,727 --> 02:07:33,146
- You've been expecting it.
- I have.

1160
02:07:33,229 --> 02:07:35,523
But have you thought how costly
my services might be?

1161
02:07:35,607 --> 02:07:37,984
We buy everything else
these days.

1162
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:41,446
No reason why we shouldn't be charged
for patriotism. What's your fee?

1163
02:07:43,615 --> 02:07:48,328
My election as first consul,
command of all the legions of Italy...

1164
02:07:48,411 --> 02:07:50,997
and the abolition of senatorial
authority over the courts.

1165
02:07:51,915 --> 02:07:54,000
Dictatorship.

1166
02:07:54,918 --> 02:07:56,544
Order.

1167
02:07:58,338 --> 02:08:00,673
- Advise me if my terms are acceptable.
- I can tell you now.

1168
02:08:00,757 --> 02:08:03,218
- They're unacceptable.
- Yes, I know.

1169
02:08:03,301 --> 02:08:06,721
For the present perhaps, but times
change, and so does the senate.

1170
02:08:06,804 --> 02:08:08,890
When that day comes,
I shall be ready.

1171
02:08:08,973 --> 02:08:11,226
- Convey my respects to your wife.
- With pleasure.

1172
02:08:14,062 --> 02:08:16,147
He's right, you know.

1173
02:08:16,231 --> 02:08:18,858
If something isn't done about Spartacus,
the senate will change.

1174
02:08:18,942 --> 02:08:21,611
And Crassus will move in
and save Rome from the slave army...

1175
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:23,696
by assuming dictatorship.

1176
02:08:26,324 --> 02:08:29,410
But that, like everything else,
depends on which way Spartacus jumps.

1177
02:08:29,494 --> 02:08:31,663
Just now, he's trying
to get out of Italy.

1178
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:34,290
If he succeeds,
the crisis is over...

1179
02:08:34,374 --> 02:08:37,418
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

1180
02:08:37,502 --> 02:08:40,839
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

1181
02:08:40,922 --> 02:08:42,215
You've done what?

1182
02:08:42,298 --> 02:08:45,510
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

1183
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,679
I've assured them
that we won't interfere...

1184
02:08:47,762 --> 02:08:50,682
if they transport Spartacus
and his slaves out of Italy.

1185
02:08:53,059 --> 02:08:57,480
So now we deal with pirates.
We bargain with criminals!

1186
02:08:57,564 --> 02:09:02,110
Don't you be so stiff-necked about it.
Politics is a practical profession.

1187
02:09:02,193 --> 02:09:06,489
If a criminal has what you want,
you do business with him.

1188
02:09:42,859 --> 02:09:45,570
How far are we from Brundusium?

1189
02:09:45,653 --> 02:09:48,198
About 20 miles.

1190
02:09:48,281 --> 02:09:52,202
Our army will have to camp here tonight.
They're still about six hours behind us.

1191
02:09:52,285 --> 02:09:56,414
Patullus, ride ahead to Brundusium.
Bring Tigranes here.

1192
02:09:56,498 --> 02:09:59,375
Marco, report back to Spartacus.

1193
02:09:59,459 --> 02:10:02,378
Tell him we camp tonight
by the sea!

1194
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,966
If all goes well, my estimate is
we can load 1 50 ships a day.

1195
02:10:48,049 --> 02:10:50,844
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

1196
02:10:50,927 --> 02:10:54,931
- That oughta keep him busy.
- Saves me finding someplace to sleep.

1197
02:10:55,014 --> 02:10:57,100
Crixus, keep giving me reports
on Pompey.

1198
02:10:57,183 --> 02:10:59,269
There won't be any surprises.

1199
02:10:59,352 --> 02:11:02,355
I still want patrols of
the back country until we board ship.

1200
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:04,315
I'll get them together now.

1201
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:07,527
Spartacus, the harbour district
in Brundusium has food warehouses...

1202
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:10,238
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

1203
02:11:10,321 --> 02:11:12,240
The countryside's filled with cattle.

1204
02:11:12,323 --> 02:11:14,409
And we've more than enough salt
to preserve them.

1205
02:11:14,492 --> 02:11:16,369
I'll handle it.

1206
02:11:16,452 --> 02:11:19,956
Find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

1207
02:11:20,039 --> 02:11:21,916
Tigranes Levantus.

1208
02:11:24,878 --> 02:11:27,005
- My dear general.
- Welcome, Tigranes!

1209
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:30,508
No, no. You needn't look
for litter bearers to emancipate.

1210
02:11:30,592 --> 02:11:32,468
I rode a horse.

1211
02:11:32,552 --> 02:11:36,222
Your gods Isis and Serapis
must've been good to us.

1212
02:11:36,306 --> 02:11:40,226
The balance of the 50 million sesterces
we owe you.

1213
02:11:41,186 --> 02:11:43,271
General...

1214
02:11:43,354 --> 02:11:46,983
I bear a heavy burden
of evil tidings.

1215
02:11:49,194 --> 02:11:51,070
What is it?

1216
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:56,284
Pompey and his army
has landed in Italy.

1217
02:11:56,367 --> 02:11:59,287
At the border of Rhegium
three days ago.

1218
02:11:59,370 --> 02:12:01,623
We get complete reports
on their movements.

1219
02:12:01,706 --> 02:12:03,666
But do you also know...

1220
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:06,044
that a Roman fleet carrying
Lucullus and his army...

1221
02:12:06,127 --> 02:12:08,213
arrives tomorrow at Brundusium?

1222
02:12:10,882 --> 02:12:14,052
- Lucullus here?
- You have no ships.

1223
02:12:17,847 --> 02:12:19,974
I saw them in the harbour.

1224
02:12:21,559 --> 02:12:25,647
The Cilician fleet,
out of strategic necessity...

1225
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:28,191
has been obliged to withdraw.

1226
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:32,821
- Withdraw?
- There are no ships at all?

1227
02:12:40,912 --> 02:12:45,291
Cilician pirates can destroy
any Roman fleet that ever sailed.

1228
02:12:45,375 --> 02:12:47,460
If they run away now,
it's not because they're afraid!

1229
02:12:47,544 --> 02:12:49,629
You better give me
a better reason.

1230
02:12:49,712 --> 02:12:51,840
I'm as desolated
as you are, General.

1231
02:12:51,923 --> 02:12:54,008
Stand up. Up!

1232
02:12:55,343 --> 02:12:57,220
On your toes.

1233
02:13:00,723 --> 02:13:04,853
- You'll cut the skin.
- Why did the Cilicians run away?

1234
02:13:04,936 --> 02:13:07,105
They were paid.

1235
02:13:07,188 --> 02:13:09,274
And who paid them?

1236
02:13:09,357 --> 02:13:11,234
Who?

1237
02:13:11,317 --> 02:13:13,194
Crassus.

1238
02:13:18,992 --> 02:13:21,286
Crassus won't fight us himself.

1239
02:13:21,369 --> 02:13:24,664
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

1240
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:28,084
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

1241
02:13:28,168 --> 02:13:30,879
I don't know. How can I answer
when there is no answer?

1242
02:13:30,962 --> 02:13:33,339
I've been betrayed,
just as you have!

1243
02:13:33,423 --> 02:13:36,342
There is an answer.

1244
02:13:36,426 --> 02:13:38,845
There must be an answer
to everything.

1245
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:42,974
We're five miles
from Brundusium.

1246
02:13:44,559 --> 02:13:47,228
Here's Rhegium.

1247
02:13:47,312 --> 02:13:50,231
Pompey's march must have
brought him to about here.

1248
02:13:50,315 --> 02:13:53,485
He's four days away,
maybe more.

1249
02:13:54,819 --> 02:13:58,114
Lucullus lands
at Brundusium tomorrow.

1250
02:13:58,198 --> 02:14:00,366
If we engage Lucullus...

1251
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:03,661
Pompey will have enough time
to march against our rear.

1252
02:14:04,996 --> 02:14:09,042
If we turn west
to meet Pompey...

1253
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:11,836
Lucullus will march
against our rear.

1254
02:14:13,087 --> 02:14:17,592
The only other army
in all of Italy is here!

1255
02:14:17,675 --> 02:14:19,302
Rome.

1256
02:14:20,011 --> 02:14:22,138
Yes, of course!

1257
02:14:22,222 --> 02:14:24,807
Crassus is inviting us
to march on Rome...

1258
02:14:24,891 --> 02:14:27,018
so he can take the field
against us.

1259
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:29,854
You mean Crassus wants us
to march on Rome?

1260
02:14:29,938 --> 02:14:32,524
He's forcing us to. He knows
I won't let myself be trapped...

1261
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:35,652
between two armies
with my back to the sea.

1262
02:14:35,735 --> 02:14:38,321
He knows my only other choice
is Rome.

1263
02:14:39,989 --> 02:14:42,617
Somewhere on the way,
we meet.

1264
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:45,912
If he beats us,
he becomes the saviour of Rome...

1265
02:14:45,995 --> 02:14:48,081
and there's his final victory
over the senate.

1266
02:14:48,164 --> 02:14:53,336
General, allow me
to redeem myself in your eyes.

1267
02:14:53,419 --> 02:14:55,338
For a very small commission...

1268
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:59,926
I can arrange for you, your family
and your leaders, of course...

1269
02:15:00,009 --> 02:15:03,096
to be smuggled out of Italy and
transported to an eastern country...

1270
02:15:03,179 --> 02:15:05,932
where men of substance like you
are welcome and appreciated.

1271
02:15:06,015 --> 02:15:08,643
You can live there like kings
for the rest of your lives.

1272
02:15:08,726 --> 02:15:10,812
What do you think, General?

1273
02:15:11,563 --> 02:15:13,648
Go away.

1274
02:15:13,731 --> 02:15:16,151
Go away?

1275
02:15:29,372 --> 02:15:31,958
Tell the trumpeters
to sound assembly.

1276
02:15:40,049 --> 02:15:44,179
Tonight a Roman army lands
in the harbour of Brundusium.

1277
02:15:45,305 --> 02:15:48,224
Another army is approaching
us from the west.

1278
02:15:48,308 --> 02:15:51,311
Between them,
they hope to trap us here...

1279
02:15:51,394 --> 02:15:53,480
against the sea.

1280
02:15:53,563 --> 02:15:57,192
The Cilician pirates have betrayed us.
We have no ships.

1281
02:15:57,275 --> 02:16:00,153
"By order of the senate...

1282
02:16:00,236 --> 02:16:03,865
be it known that we have
this day elected...

1283
02:16:03,948 --> 02:16:06,701
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1284
02:16:06,784 --> 02:16:09,662
first consul of the Republic...

1285
02:16:09,746 --> 02:16:14,250
and commander in chief
of the armies of Rome."

1286
02:16:14,334 --> 02:16:17,587
Hail Crassus!

1287
02:16:17,670 --> 02:16:21,716
Rome will not allow us
to escape from Italy.

1288
02:16:22,967 --> 02:16:26,471
We have no choice
but to march against Rome herself...

1289
02:16:26,554 --> 02:16:30,808
and end this war the only way
it could have ended:

1290
02:16:30,892 --> 02:16:34,562
by freeing every slave in Italy.

1291
02:16:34,646 --> 02:16:37,190
I promise you...

1292
02:16:37,273 --> 02:16:39,609
a new Rome...

1293
02:16:39,692 --> 02:16:41,736
a new Italy
and a new empire.

1294
02:16:42,904 --> 02:16:45,448
I promise the destruction
of the slave army...

1295
02:16:46,449 --> 02:16:49,202
and the restoration of order...

1296
02:16:49,285 --> 02:16:51,371
throughout all our territories.

1297
02:16:51,454 --> 02:16:55,708
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers...

1298
02:16:55,792 --> 02:16:59,170
facing a long march
and a hard fight...

1299
02:16:59,254 --> 02:17:02,632
than to be the richest citizen
of Rome...

1300
02:17:02,715 --> 02:17:05,677
fat with food
he didn't work for...

1301
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,887
and surrounded by slaves.

1302
02:17:07,971 --> 02:17:11,474
I promise the living body
of Spartacus...

1303
02:17:11,558 --> 02:17:14,936
for whatever punishment
you may deem fit.

1304
02:17:15,019 --> 02:17:18,398
That or his head.

1305
02:17:19,315 --> 02:17:23,820
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

1306
02:17:23,903 --> 02:17:26,573
This I have sworn...

1307
02:17:26,656 --> 02:17:29,242
in the temple
that guards their bones.

1308
02:17:30,952 --> 02:17:33,288
Hail Crassus!

1309
02:17:33,371 --> 02:17:36,749
We've travelled
a long ways together.

1310
02:17:36,833 --> 02:17:41,546
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

1311
02:17:41,629 --> 02:17:46,217
Now, instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea...

1312
02:17:46,301 --> 02:17:49,304
we must fight again.

1313
02:17:49,387 --> 02:17:52,223
Maybe there's no peace
in this world...

1314
02:17:52,307 --> 02:17:55,602
for us or for anyone else.
I don't know.

1315
02:17:56,686 --> 02:17:58,771
But I do know...

1316
02:17:58,855 --> 02:18:01,149
that as long as we live...

1317
02:18:01,232 --> 02:18:04,652
we must stay true to ourselves.

1318
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:10,700
I do know that we're brothers,
and I know that we're free.

1319
02:18:17,707 --> 02:18:19,792
We march tonight!

1320
02:19:53,678 --> 02:19:56,431
Hail Crassus!

1321
02:19:56,514 --> 02:19:58,600
Greetings to you, Crassus.

1322
02:19:58,683 --> 02:20:01,019
Caius. Gentlemen.

1323
02:20:02,187 --> 02:20:04,272
Have your dispositions
been made?

1324
02:20:04,355 --> 02:20:08,818
Each maniple knows its position in line,
sir, and exactly what's expected.

1325
02:20:08,902 --> 02:20:12,780
Every legion commander
has been given his battle orders.

1326
02:20:12,864 --> 02:20:15,575
Excellent. All positions
will now be changed.

1327
02:20:15,658 --> 02:20:17,577
Changed?

1328
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:20,747
Spartacus takes too keen
an interest in our plans, I fear.

1329
02:20:22,207 --> 02:20:25,502
New battle orders
will be issued in a short while.

1330
02:20:28,213 --> 02:20:32,050
Spartacus has every reason to believe
that he has outdistanced...

1331
02:20:32,133 --> 02:20:35,845
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and of Lucullus.

1332
02:20:35,929 --> 02:20:39,098
However, there are passes
through the Apennine Mountains...

1333
02:20:39,182 --> 02:20:41,476
unknown to any map.

1334
02:20:42,977 --> 02:20:47,232
It may fortify
your courage to know...

1335
02:20:47,315 --> 02:20:51,528
that Pompey is at this moment encamped
some 20 miles to the west of us...

1336
02:20:51,611 --> 02:20:54,405
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south...

1337
02:20:54,489 --> 02:20:56,574
by forced night march.

1338
02:20:56,658 --> 02:21:00,829
Sir, allow us to pledge you the most
glorious victory ofyour career.

1339
02:21:02,914 --> 02:21:04,999
I'm not after glory!

1340
02:21:05,917 --> 02:21:08,002
I'm after Spartacus.

1341
02:21:09,045 --> 02:21:11,464
And, gentlemen,
I mean to have him.

1342
02:21:12,966 --> 02:21:17,303
However, this campaign
is not alone to kill Spartacus.

1343
02:21:17,387 --> 02:21:20,473
It is to kill
the legend of Spartacus.

1344
02:21:22,350 --> 02:21:24,435
You may go, gentlemen.

1345
02:21:24,519 --> 02:21:26,396
Hail Crassus.

1346
02:21:29,149 --> 02:21:31,276
Lentulus Batiatus
awaits Your Excellency.

1347
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:33,611
- Who?
- The lanista, sir.

1348
02:21:35,113 --> 02:21:37,240
Admit him.

1349
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:42,036
Most Blessed Highness,
as soon as I received your message...

1350
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:44,122
I hurried into your
distinguished presence.

1351
02:21:44,205 --> 02:21:46,958
I'm glad you were able
to spare the time. Sit down.

1352
02:21:48,209 --> 02:21:50,086
How gracious.

1353
02:21:50,879 --> 02:21:53,965
I understand--
I'm informed--

1354
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:56,509
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

1355
02:21:56,593 --> 02:21:58,678
Yes! In fact...

1356
02:21:58,761 --> 02:22:01,389
if it isn't too subversive
to say so...

1357
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:04,726
I made him
what he is today.

1358
02:22:04,809 --> 02:22:07,145
You're to be congratulated
indeed.

1359
02:22:07,228 --> 02:22:11,316
I, too, as it happens, since you're
so admirably qualified to give me...

1360
02:22:11,399 --> 02:22:13,860
what up to now
I've not been able to obtain:

1361
02:22:13,943 --> 02:22:16,154
a physical description
of Spartacus.

1362
02:22:16,237 --> 02:22:17,322
Yes.

1363
02:22:17,906 --> 02:22:20,074
But you saw him.

1364
02:22:21,784 --> 02:22:23,912
- What?
- In the ring.

1365
02:22:25,246 --> 02:22:27,248
When?

1366
02:22:27,332 --> 02:22:31,044
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

1367
02:22:32,587 --> 02:22:34,839
What?

1368
02:22:34,923 --> 02:22:37,258
I trust they're both
in good health.

1369
02:22:37,342 --> 02:22:40,595
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the Negro.

1370
02:22:40,678 --> 02:22:43,723
- I remember the Negro.
- You had good cause to, if I remember--

1371
02:22:43,806 --> 02:22:46,017
If I may say so, Your Excellency.

1372
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:48,478
A brilliant dagger thrust.
Difficult angle.

1373
02:22:48,561 --> 02:22:50,647
- Spartacus was the opponent?
- Yes.

1374
02:22:53,608 --> 02:22:55,985
What did he look like?

1375
02:22:56,069 --> 02:22:58,780
That's a matter of some
importance to Your Highness?

1376
02:22:58,863 --> 02:23:03,451
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

1377
02:23:03,535 --> 02:23:05,620
We're both Roman patriots, sir.

1378
02:23:05,703 --> 02:23:08,122
You're a great one.
I, of course, smaller.

1379
02:23:08,206 --> 02:23:10,750
But we both believe
in Roman fair play.

1380
02:23:10,834 --> 02:23:12,877
If you want
something from me...

1381
02:23:12,961 --> 02:23:16,005
I would be lacking
in respect for my own conscience...

1382
02:23:16,089 --> 02:23:18,174
if I did not say
that I wish something from you.

1383
02:23:18,258 --> 02:23:20,385
Name your price.

1384
02:23:20,468 --> 02:23:22,679
If-- no--

1385
02:23:22,762 --> 02:23:25,390
when you win
your victory tomorrow...

1386
02:23:25,473 --> 02:23:28,184
presumably the survivors
will be auctioned off...

1387
02:23:28,268 --> 02:23:31,604
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

1388
02:23:32,981 --> 02:23:35,817
Could not the agent
for that sale be he...

1389
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:40,113
who shares this tiny moment
of history with Your Honour?

1390
02:23:41,698 --> 02:23:45,660
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

1391
02:23:46,452 --> 02:23:49,372
In return, you will remain here with us
until after the battle...

1392
02:23:49,455 --> 02:23:51,624
and aid me
in identifying Spartacus.

1393
02:23:51,708 --> 02:23:53,585
After the battle?

1394
02:23:53,668 --> 02:23:56,379
You misunderstand me.
I'm a civilian.

1395
02:23:56,462 --> 02:23:59,841
I'm even more of a civilian
than most civilians.

1396
02:24:00,592 --> 02:24:02,677
If you wish to remain so...

1397
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:06,055
I should strongly advise you
to stay here and be our guest.

1398
02:24:06,139 --> 02:24:07,557
Guard!

1399
02:24:13,188 --> 02:24:17,984
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1400
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:21,237
what if it is Spartacus
who crosses the battlefield...

1401
02:24:21,321 --> 02:24:23,239
looking for you?

1402
02:24:25,366 --> 02:24:28,244
In such circumstances,
I have no doubt...

1403
02:24:28,328 --> 02:24:30,580
you will be helping him.

1404
02:24:30,663 --> 02:24:33,458
This fellow remains with us
until after the battle.

1405
02:24:33,541 --> 02:24:37,712
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.

1406
02:26:10,722 --> 02:26:13,308
Mommy? Mommy?

1407
02:26:16,144 --> 02:26:18,730
When do we go home?

1408
02:26:23,193 --> 02:26:25,278
Go to sleep, dear.

1409
02:26:58,686 --> 02:27:00,980
No pains yet?

1410
02:27:01,064 --> 02:27:03,733
He's a bad child, though.
He hits me with his fist.

1411
02:27:03,817 --> 02:27:06,110
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?

1412
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:09,155
Can you feel it?

1413
02:27:10,448 --> 02:27:12,367
No, I don't.

1414
02:27:12,450 --> 02:27:14,869
I hope he waits
till we get to Rome.

1415
02:27:18,373 --> 02:27:20,250
Rome!

1416
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:24,087
They've never beaten us yet.

1417
02:27:26,798 --> 02:27:29,092
No.

1418
02:27:30,677 --> 02:27:33,596
But no matter how many times
we beat them...

1419
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,600
they still seem to have
another army to send against us.

1420
02:27:37,684 --> 02:27:39,602
And another.

1421
02:27:42,063 --> 02:27:45,817
Varinia, it just seems
like we've started something...

1422
02:27:46,693 --> 02:27:48,695
that has no ending!

1423
02:27:48,778 --> 02:27:52,323
If it ended tomorrow,
it would be worth it.

1424
02:27:59,581 --> 02:28:03,793
Varinia, don't make me weak.

1425
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:07,380
You're strong enough
to be weak.

1426
02:28:12,218 --> 02:28:14,512
I love you more than my life.

1427
02:28:16,764 --> 02:28:20,685
Yet, sometimes, even with you here
sleeping beside me...

1428
02:28:22,604 --> 02:28:24,689
I feel so alone.

1429
02:28:26,316 --> 02:28:29,652
I imagine a god for slaves...

1430
02:28:29,736 --> 02:28:32,447
and I pray.

1431
02:28:32,530 --> 02:28:34,616
What do you pray for?

1432
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:39,245
I pray for a son
who'll be born free.

1433
02:28:40,914 --> 02:28:43,208
I pray for the same thing.

1434
02:28:48,213 --> 02:28:50,298
Take care of my son, Varinia.

1435
02:28:51,925 --> 02:28:54,010
If he never knows me...

1436
02:28:54,093 --> 02:28:57,764
tell him who I was
and what we dreamed of.

1437
02:28:57,847 --> 02:29:01,267
Tell him the truth. There will be
plenty of others to tell him lies.

1438
02:29:01,351 --> 02:29:03,436
I can't live without you,
Spartacus!

1439
02:29:16,491 --> 02:29:19,410
For you and me
there can be no farewells.

1440
02:29:23,915 --> 02:29:26,709
As long as one of us lives...

1441
02:29:26,793 --> 02:29:28,878
we all live.

1442
02:29:29,838 --> 02:29:32,799
I felt it! Did you feel it?

1443
02:29:32,882 --> 02:29:35,802
- Yes, I did.
- That was so strong. Does it hurt you?

1444
02:29:36,886 --> 02:29:38,972
That was so strong.

1445
02:36:01,013 --> 02:36:03,516
Lucullus and Pompey.

1446
02:39:42,026 --> 02:39:44,070
Have we a count of prisoners?

1447
02:39:44,153 --> 02:39:46,823
We haven't made
the final count, sir.

1448
02:39:46,906 --> 02:39:49,992
I bring a message
from your master...

1449
02:39:50,076 --> 02:39:53,454
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1450
02:39:53,538 --> 02:39:55,998
commander of Italy.

1451
02:39:56,082 --> 02:39:59,919
By command of
His Most Merciful Excellency...

1452
02:40:00,002 --> 02:40:02,588
your lives are to be spared.

1453
02:40:05,758 --> 02:40:07,677
Slaves you were...

1454
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:09,846
and slaves you remain.

1455
02:40:09,929 --> 02:40:13,349
But the terrible penalty
of crucifixion...

1456
02:40:13,432 --> 02:40:15,518
has been set aside...

1457
02:40:15,601 --> 02:40:19,897
on the single condition
that you identify the body...

1458
02:40:19,981 --> 02:40:24,777
or the living person
of the slave called Spartacus.

1459
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:40,001
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

1460
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:28,007
Forgive me for being one of the last
to congratulate you, Your Nobility.

1461
02:41:28,090 --> 02:41:30,927
There's an ugly rumour
going round the camp...

1462
02:41:31,010 --> 02:41:33,721
that the prisoners
are to be crucified.

1463
02:41:34,472 --> 02:41:36,349
That is true.

1464
02:41:37,767 --> 02:41:39,852
Perhaps this is the moment
to remind Your Highness...

1465
02:41:39,936 --> 02:41:43,481
that yesterday you promised me I could
be the agent in their auctioning.

1466
02:41:43,564 --> 02:41:47,318
Last night you promised
Spartacus to me! Where is he?

1467
02:41:47,401 --> 02:41:49,487
In return, I promised you
the sale of the survivors...

1468
02:41:49,570 --> 02:41:51,781
and there will be none!

1469
02:42:16,889 --> 02:42:19,308
- It's Varinia.
- Yes, I remember.

1470
02:42:19,392 --> 02:42:21,727
You're the woman of Spartacus?

1471
02:42:21,811 --> 02:42:23,980
I'm his wife.

1472
02:42:24,063 --> 02:42:26,149
And this is his child?

1473
02:42:27,525 --> 02:42:28,776
Yes.

1474
02:42:29,318 --> 02:42:31,195
Where is Spartacus?

1475
02:42:35,408 --> 02:42:37,076
Dead.

1476
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:39,745
Did you see him killed?

1477
02:42:44,542 --> 02:42:45,877
Yes.

1478
02:42:47,670 --> 02:42:51,299
You're lying. Where is he?

1479
02:42:56,053 --> 02:42:58,347
At least here is someone
worth selling, Your Enormity.

1480
02:42:58,431 --> 02:43:01,309
I'll even take the child
as an investment.

1481
02:43:02,685 --> 02:43:05,188
- How many women have been taken?
- Under forty, sir.

1482
02:43:05,271 --> 02:43:08,357
Most of those who weren't killed have
run to the hills with their children.

1483
02:43:08,441 --> 02:43:10,735
You may sell all the others,
but not this woman.

1484
02:43:10,818 --> 02:43:12,862
But you haven't seen
the others, Your Magnitude.

1485
02:43:12,945 --> 02:43:15,865
They're of surpassing ugliness!
A genius wouldn't be able to sell them!

1486
02:43:15,948 --> 02:43:18,868
Flog that scoundrel out of camp.

1487
02:43:18,951 --> 02:43:22,413
This woman and her child
are to be conveyed to my house in Rome.

1488
02:43:36,636 --> 02:43:38,763
- Halt them!
- Halt!

1489
02:43:43,434 --> 02:43:44,727
Antoninus?

1490
02:44:02,411 --> 02:44:03,454
Tribune!

1491
02:44:10,002 --> 02:44:13,339
Slaves are to be crucified
along the roadside...

1492
02:44:13,422 --> 02:44:17,593
the whole distance between here
and the gates of Rome.

1493
02:44:20,721 --> 02:44:22,807
Hold this man till the end.

1494
02:44:26,185 --> 02:44:28,062
And that man too.

1495
02:44:35,045 --> 02:44:37,130
- March on.
- March on!

1496
02:45:30,976 --> 02:45:33,687
I've more stripes on my back
than a zebra!

1497
02:45:33,770 --> 02:45:36,606
Every time I touch my wounds...

1498
02:45:37,315 --> 02:45:40,193
they sing like larks.

1499
02:45:40,277 --> 02:45:42,404
But in spite of that,
I think I've found something...

1500
02:45:42,487 --> 02:45:45,240
- I never had before with all my wealth.
- What is that?

1501
02:45:46,449 --> 02:45:49,369
Don't laugh at me,
but I believe it to be dignity.

1502
02:45:49,452 --> 02:45:52,038
In Rome,
dignity shortens life...

1503
02:45:52,122 --> 02:45:54,583
even more surely than disease.

1504
02:45:54,666 --> 02:45:57,127
The gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise.

1505
02:45:57,752 --> 02:45:59,796
You think so?

1506
02:45:59,880 --> 02:46:04,301
Anyone who believes I'll turn informer
for nothing is a fool.

1507
02:46:04,384 --> 02:46:06,970
I bore the whip
without complaint.

1508
02:46:07,053 --> 02:46:10,974
Yes, indeed, that sounds
like a bad attack of dignity.

1509
02:46:11,057 --> 02:46:13,435
I hope, however,
this will not deflect you...

1510
02:46:13,518 --> 02:46:15,854
from the revenge
you were going to take on Crassus.

1511
02:46:15,937 --> 02:46:18,648
No, on the contrary.
It only strengthens my resolve.

1512
02:46:18,732 --> 02:46:21,485
I'm glad to learn that.

1513
02:46:23,695 --> 02:46:27,282
This woman Varinia is in his house.
All Rome knows about it.

1514
02:46:27,365 --> 02:46:29,451
Malicious tongues even say...

1515
02:46:29,534 --> 02:46:32,704
that he's in love
for the first time in his life.

1516
02:46:36,625 --> 02:46:39,377
I noticed a strange look in his eye
when he first saw her.

1517
02:46:39,461 --> 02:46:41,796
It would take a great woman...

1518
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:45,008
to make Crassus
fall out of love with himself.

1519
02:46:45,091 --> 02:46:47,177
I'll be honest with you,
Gracchus.

1520
02:46:47,260 --> 02:46:50,430
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

1521
02:46:50,514 --> 02:46:54,476
Dignity and honesty in one afternoon!
I hardly recognize you.

1522
02:46:55,268 --> 02:46:57,979
- But she is an impossible woman.
- Beautiful?

1523
02:46:58,063 --> 02:47:00,398
Beautiful? Well, beautiful.

1524
02:47:00,482 --> 02:47:03,151
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

1525
02:47:03,235 --> 02:47:05,320
- Proud?
- Proud, proud.

1526
02:47:05,403 --> 02:47:08,156
You'd feel that she would surrender
to the right man...

1527
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:10,534
which is irritating.

1528
02:47:11,326 --> 02:47:15,413
I like Crassus.
Let's save him from his agony.

1529
02:47:15,497 --> 02:47:17,582
Let's steal this woman.

1530
02:47:18,750 --> 02:47:21,169
Steal the woman? Why?

1531
02:47:21,253 --> 02:47:23,547
I can no longer hurt Crassus
in the senate...

1532
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:27,342
but I can hurt him where
he'll feel it most: in his pride.

1533
02:47:27,425 --> 02:47:29,636
Attack our enemy from within.

1534
02:47:29,719 --> 02:47:31,596
The scheme is excellent...

1535
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:34,766
but I hope you're not suggesting
that I steal the woman!

1536
02:47:34,850 --> 02:47:37,018
Yes.

1537
02:47:37,102 --> 02:47:40,230
Buy some horses
and a cart with a canopy.

1538
02:47:40,313 --> 02:47:42,399
Bring her here by nightfall.

1539
02:47:44,359 --> 02:47:48,113
Add courage
to your newfound virtues.

1540
02:47:50,157 --> 02:47:53,577
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

1541
02:47:56,329 --> 02:47:58,456
Half a million?

1542
02:48:02,377 --> 02:48:07,299
Crassus does seem to dwindle
in the mind, but--

1543
02:48:07,382 --> 02:48:10,343
Let's reduce him still further.
A round million!

1544
02:48:11,553 --> 02:48:13,638
A million.

1545
02:48:13,722 --> 02:48:15,932
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

1546
02:48:17,017 --> 02:48:19,144
With a lesser sum, I have.

1547
02:48:25,484 --> 02:48:27,319
Forgive the intrusion.

1548
02:48:27,402 --> 02:48:30,071
You know I'm not in the habit
of coming into your house uninvited.

1549
02:48:30,155 --> 02:48:32,240
You've always been welcome here...

1550
02:48:32,324 --> 02:48:34,409
as a pupil.

1551
02:48:38,330 --> 02:48:40,999
- You're not alone.
- No.

1552
02:48:42,792 --> 02:48:45,712
This time you've come to teach.

1553
02:48:47,339 --> 02:48:49,424
You've joined Crassus?

1554
02:48:50,425 --> 02:48:52,761
- Am I arrested?
- No.

1555
02:48:52,844 --> 02:48:55,597
But I must ask you to come with me
to the senate immediately.

1556
02:48:57,891 --> 02:49:00,352
What I do,
I do not for myself...

1557
02:49:01,269 --> 02:49:03,522
but for Rome.

1558
02:49:03,605 --> 02:49:06,358
Poor helpless Rome!

1559
02:49:06,441 --> 02:49:10,695
Let's go and hear more
about Rome from Crassus!

1560
02:49:15,742 --> 02:49:18,078
Did you truly believe
500 years of Rome...

1561
02:49:18,161 --> 02:49:21,957
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

1562
02:49:25,377 --> 02:49:29,381
Already the bodies
of 6,000 crucified slaves...

1563
02:49:29,464 --> 02:49:31,800
line the Appian Way.

1564
02:49:31,883 --> 02:49:34,803
Tomorrow the last of their companions
will fight to the death...

1565
02:49:34,886 --> 02:49:38,932
in the temple of my fathers
as a sacrifice to them.

1566
02:49:39,015 --> 02:49:42,727
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble...

1567
02:49:42,811 --> 02:49:47,983
if they falter one instant
in loyalty to the new order of affairs.

1568
02:49:48,066 --> 02:49:51,111
The enemies of the state
are known.

1569
02:49:51,194 --> 02:49:55,240
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

1570
02:49:55,323 --> 02:49:59,870
In every city and province, lists
of the disloyal have been compiled.

1571
02:49:59,953 --> 02:50:04,666
Tomorrow they will learn
the cost of their terrible folly...

1572
02:50:05,417 --> 02:50:07,127
their treason.

1573
02:50:08,587 --> 02:50:10,589
Where does my name appear...

1574
02:50:10,672 --> 02:50:13,967
on the list of disloyal enemies
of the state?

1575
02:50:14,050 --> 02:50:15,802
First.

1576
02:50:17,804 --> 02:50:21,433
Yet upon you I have
no desire for vengeance.

1577
02:50:22,267 --> 02:50:24,728
Your property
shall not be touched.

1578
02:50:24,811 --> 02:50:28,398
You will retain the rank
and title of Roman senator.

1579
02:50:28,482 --> 02:50:30,567
A house...

1580
02:50:30,650 --> 02:50:34,905
a farmhouse in Picenum
has been provided for your exile.

1581
02:50:34,988 --> 02:50:37,073
You may take your women
with you.

1582
02:50:39,117 --> 02:50:43,121
Why am I to be left
so conspicuously alive?

1583
02:50:43,205 --> 02:50:46,917
Your followers are
deluded enough to trust you.

1584
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,045
I intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for their own good...

1585
02:50:50,128 --> 02:50:53,507
their peaceful
and profitable future.

1586
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:56,384
From time to time thereafter,
I may find it useful...

1587
02:50:56,468 --> 02:50:59,596
to bring you back to Rome
to continue your duty to her...

1588
02:50:59,679 --> 02:51:02,557
to calm the envious spirit...

1589
02:51:02,641 --> 02:51:04,810
and the troubled mind.

1590
02:51:04,893 --> 02:51:10,232
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order...

1591
02:51:10,315 --> 02:51:12,567
and trust the gods!

1592
02:51:16,822 --> 02:51:18,782
You may go.

1593
02:51:29,584 --> 02:51:31,461
Halt!

1594
02:52:17,382 --> 02:52:20,510
Now, why hide
behind that stola?

1595
02:52:25,557 --> 02:52:27,601
That's better.

1596
02:52:27,684 --> 02:52:31,062
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

1597
02:52:31,146 --> 02:52:35,692
You, above all people, should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly.

1598
02:52:35,775 --> 02:52:37,652
Come here.

1599
02:52:51,833 --> 02:52:53,919
This belonged to a queen...

1600
02:52:55,420 --> 02:52:57,506
the queen of Persia.

1601
02:52:58,173 --> 02:53:00,258
It's heavy.

1602
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:04,095
In time you will wear it
lightly enough.

1603
02:53:17,567 --> 02:53:19,444
Sit down.

1604
02:53:22,531 --> 02:53:25,784
Will you have
some squab and honey?

1605
02:53:27,244 --> 02:53:28,703
No.

1606
02:53:28,787 --> 02:53:30,872
You'll enjoy it.

1607
02:53:32,123 --> 02:53:34,209
And a piece of melon?

1608
02:53:38,463 --> 02:53:40,549
And some wine, of course.

1609
02:53:42,467 --> 02:53:44,135
Eat.

1610
02:53:49,724 --> 02:53:51,768
I did not command you to eat.

1611
02:53:51,852 --> 02:53:53,937
I invited you.

1612
02:53:55,438 --> 02:53:57,858
You find the richness
of your surroundings...

1613
02:53:57,941 --> 02:54:00,026
makes conversation difficult?

1614
02:54:02,821 --> 02:54:04,906
Why am I here?

1615
02:54:08,201 --> 02:54:10,620
Good question.

1616
02:54:10,704 --> 02:54:13,498
A woman's question.

1617
02:54:13,582 --> 02:54:17,210
I wish the answer could be
as good and straightforward.

1618
02:54:21,298 --> 02:54:24,801
- The infant-- it thrives?
- He thrives.

1619
02:54:24,885 --> 02:54:27,137
I purchased a wet nurse
for him yesterday.

1620
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:29,473
I hope milk agrees with him.

1621
02:54:32,476 --> 02:54:34,853
I sent her away.

1622
02:54:34,936 --> 02:54:37,689
I prefer to nurse
the child myself.

1623
02:54:38,899 --> 02:54:40,984
I'm not sure I approve.

1624
02:54:42,194 --> 02:54:45,113
It ties you to the old life.

1625
02:54:45,197 --> 02:54:48,783
I want you to begin
to look forward to the new.

1626
02:54:51,077 --> 02:54:53,914
I don't care
about my new life here.

1627
02:54:53,997 --> 02:54:56,875
You care about the life
of your child, don't you?

1628
02:54:58,585 --> 02:55:01,630
Why do you threaten me
with my baby?

1629
02:55:01,713 --> 02:55:04,341
I belong to you.
You can take me anytime you wish.

1630
02:55:04,925 --> 02:55:07,636
But I don't want to take you.

1631
02:55:08,595 --> 02:55:10,889
I want you to give.

1632
02:55:12,474 --> 02:55:14,559
I want your love, Varinia.

1633
02:55:18,772 --> 02:55:21,191
You think by threatening
to kill my child...

1634
02:55:21,274 --> 02:55:23,318
you'll make me love you?

1635
02:55:23,401 --> 02:55:26,738
I did not threaten
to kill your child.

1636
02:55:33,745 --> 02:55:36,832
I'm sorry, Varinia.

1637
02:55:43,129 --> 02:55:45,423
One shouldn't grieve forever.

1638
02:55:46,466 --> 02:55:48,552
I'm not grieving.

1639
02:55:48,635 --> 02:55:50,720
I'm remembering.

1640
02:55:50,804 --> 02:55:53,056
Do I interfere
with your memories?

1641
02:55:54,266 --> 02:55:56,351
No.

1642
02:55:58,478 --> 02:56:00,605
You tread the ridge
between truth and insult...

1643
02:56:00,689 --> 02:56:02,774
with the skill
of a mountain goat!

1644
02:56:07,112 --> 02:56:10,198
What do you remember
when you think about Spartacus?

1645
02:56:12,909 --> 02:56:15,162
It doesn't distress you
to talk about him?

1646
02:56:15,245 --> 02:56:16,288
No.

1647
02:56:18,373 --> 02:56:20,292
Well, then...

1648
02:56:21,918 --> 02:56:24,671
what sort of a man was he...

1649
02:56:25,338 --> 02:56:27,007
really?

1650
02:56:31,303 --> 02:56:34,222
He was a man
who began all alone...

1651
02:56:34,306 --> 02:56:36,725
like an animal.

1652
02:56:36,808 --> 02:56:38,894
Yet on the day he died...

1653
02:56:38,977 --> 02:56:42,481
thousands and thousands
would gladly have died in his place.

1654
02:56:44,149 --> 02:56:46,776
What was he?
Was he a god?

1655
02:56:48,361 --> 02:56:50,447
He wasn't a god.

1656
02:56:51,114 --> 02:56:53,325
He was a simple man.

1657
02:56:53,408 --> 02:56:55,327
A slave.

1658
02:56:57,913 --> 02:56:59,789
I loved him.

1659
02:57:00,832 --> 02:57:03,251
He was an outlaw!
A murderer!

1660
02:57:03,335 --> 02:57:07,172
An enemy to everything fine
and decent that Rome ever built!

1661
02:57:08,632 --> 02:57:10,759
Damn you! You tell me.

1662
02:57:10,842 --> 02:57:13,178
- Why did you love him?
- I can't tell you.

1663
02:57:14,346 --> 02:57:16,807
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

1664
02:57:18,725 --> 02:57:21,603
But I want to understand.

1665
02:57:22,354 --> 02:57:26,525
Don't you see?
I must understand.

1666
02:57:35,075 --> 02:57:37,494
You're afraid of him,
aren't you?

1667
02:57:41,665 --> 02:57:43,959
That's why you want his wife...

1668
02:57:44,042 --> 02:57:48,004
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

1669
02:57:50,048 --> 02:57:53,885
When you're so afraid,
nothing can help.

1670
02:57:53,969 --> 02:57:55,846
Nothing.

1671
02:58:03,728 --> 02:58:05,397
We shall see.

1672
02:58:30,672 --> 02:58:32,924
Could we have won,
Spartacus?

1673
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:37,262
Could we ever have won?

1674
02:58:41,725 --> 02:58:44,478
Just by fighting them,
we won something.

1675
02:58:47,898 --> 02:58:51,234
When just one man says,
"No, I won't"...

1676
02:58:51,318 --> 02:58:53,445
Rome begins to fear.

1677
02:58:58,450 --> 02:59:01,077
And we were tens of thousands
who said no.

1678
02:59:02,329 --> 02:59:05,123
That was the wonder of it.

1679
02:59:05,207 --> 02:59:08,793
To have seen slaves
lift their heads from the dust...

1680
02:59:10,962 --> 02:59:13,757
to see them rise
from their knees...

1681
02:59:14,466 --> 02:59:16,551
stand tall...

1682
02:59:18,637 --> 02:59:20,764
with a song on their lips...

1683
02:59:22,474 --> 02:59:24,351
to hear them...

1684
02:59:25,352 --> 02:59:28,980
storm through the mountains
shouting...

1685
02:59:31,316 --> 02:59:34,110
to hear them sing
along the plains.

1686
02:59:37,656 --> 02:59:39,950
And now they're dead.

1687
02:59:42,494 --> 02:59:44,162
Dead.

1688
02:59:50,502 --> 02:59:52,170
Varinia...

1689
02:59:55,549 --> 02:59:57,217
dead.

1690
03:00:01,138 --> 03:00:03,223
And the baby.

1691
03:00:15,986 --> 03:00:17,654
All of them.

1692
03:00:28,665 --> 03:00:31,168
Are you afraid to die,
Spartacus?

1693
03:00:34,129 --> 03:00:36,423
No more than I was
to be born.

1694
03:00:47,976 --> 03:00:50,061
Are you afraid?

1695
03:00:52,898 --> 03:00:54,983
Yes.

1696
03:01:07,078 --> 03:01:09,039
Hail Counsel!

1697
03:01:09,122 --> 03:01:11,708
Guards, fall in.

1698
03:01:11,791 --> 03:01:14,753
- Where are the gladiators?
- Over there, sir.

1699
03:01:39,194 --> 03:01:43,448
Antoninus, the night passes slowly,
doesn't it?

1700
03:02:01,800 --> 03:02:03,718
You are he...

1701
03:02:04,594 --> 03:02:06,263
aren't you?

1702
03:02:09,307 --> 03:02:13,603
Gladiator,
I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

1703
03:02:16,731 --> 03:02:21,486
You must answer
when I speak to you.

1704
03:02:44,217 --> 03:02:45,886
Centurion!

1705
03:02:48,763 --> 03:02:52,517
Let them fight now.
Unchain them.

1706
03:02:52,601 --> 03:02:54,936
The entire city's been told
they'll fight tomorrow...

1707
03:02:55,020 --> 03:02:57,022
in the temple ofyour ancestors.

1708
03:02:57,105 --> 03:03:00,400
They will fight now, for me.
Here!

1709
03:03:00,484 --> 03:03:02,277
And to the death.

1710
03:03:02,360 --> 03:03:04,362
And the victor shall be crucified.

1711
03:03:04,446 --> 03:03:08,783
We will test this myth
of slave brotherhood.

1712
03:03:08,867 --> 03:03:10,243
Unchain them!

1713
03:03:17,918 --> 03:03:19,836
Form a circle.

1714
03:03:36,144 --> 03:03:38,230
Don't give them
the pleasure of a contest.

1715
03:03:38,313 --> 03:03:40,398
Lower your guard.
I'll kill you on the first rush.

1716
03:03:40,482 --> 03:03:43,652
- I won't let them crucify you!
- It's my last order. Obey it!

1717
03:03:43,735 --> 03:03:45,612
Let them begin.

1718
03:04:22,274 --> 03:04:24,526
I won't let them crucify you.

1719
03:04:35,245 --> 03:04:37,747
Do you realize how long it takes
to die on the cross?

1720
03:04:37,831 --> 03:04:39,541
I don't care!

1721
03:04:56,433 --> 03:04:58,560
Forgive me, Antoninus.

1722
03:05:08,820 --> 03:05:13,033
I love you, Spartacus,
as I loved my own father.

1723
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:15,869
I love you...

1724
03:05:15,952 --> 03:05:18,538
like my son
that I'll never see.

1725
03:05:22,876 --> 03:05:24,961
Go to sleep.

1726
03:05:58,787 --> 03:06:00,914
Here's your victory.

1727
03:06:02,916 --> 03:06:05,001
He'll come back.

1728
03:06:05,085 --> 03:06:07,712
He'll come back
and he'll be millions!

1729
03:06:12,592 --> 03:06:15,720
I wonder what Spartacus
would say...

1730
03:06:15,804 --> 03:06:19,432
if he knew that the woman,
Varinia, and her child...

1731
03:06:20,267 --> 03:06:22,686
are slaves in my household?

1732
03:06:35,532 --> 03:06:37,284
Yes.

1733
03:06:45,208 --> 03:06:47,085
Crucify him!

1734
03:07:06,104 --> 03:07:08,732
I want no grave for him.
No marker.

1735
03:07:08,815 --> 03:07:12,319
His body's to be burnt
and his ashes scattered in secret.

1736
03:07:22,162 --> 03:07:24,539
Did you fear him, Crassus?

1737
03:07:24,623 --> 03:07:26,708
Not when I fought him.

1738
03:07:26,791 --> 03:07:28,793
I knew he could be beaten.

1739
03:07:28,877 --> 03:07:32,756
But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

1740
03:07:32,839 --> 03:07:35,842
- Me?
- Yes, my dear Caesar.

1741
03:07:35,926 --> 03:07:37,594
You!

1742
03:07:38,762 --> 03:07:41,848
I don't see the letter here
to the leader of the senate.

1743
03:07:43,391 --> 03:07:46,228
Julia, I don't like
the sound of weeping.

1744
03:07:46,311 --> 03:07:48,939
This is a happy house.
Please stop it.

1745
03:07:50,065 --> 03:07:53,193
There you are. Go away, Julia!
Where have you been all this time?

1746
03:07:53,276 --> 03:07:55,695
The city is full of Crassus' legions.
We've been hiding.

1747
03:07:55,779 --> 03:07:58,365
I don't know Rome
as well as I know Capua.

1748
03:07:58,448 --> 03:08:00,700
They're arresting everyone!

1749
03:08:10,126 --> 03:08:12,128
So this is the woman...

1750
03:08:12,212 --> 03:08:14,464
it took Crassus'
eight Roman legions to conquer!

1751
03:08:14,548 --> 03:08:17,884
I wish I had time to make
your acquaintance, my dear.

1752
03:08:17,968 --> 03:08:21,555
Unfortunately, we all have
to make journeys...

1753
03:08:21,638 --> 03:08:23,723
to different destinations.

1754
03:08:23,807 --> 03:08:27,394
- Where are we going?
- You're going to Aquitania.

1755
03:08:27,477 --> 03:08:30,147
The governor's one
of my innumerable cousins.

1756
03:08:30,230 --> 03:08:32,482
Here's a senatorial pass.
It's valid in all the known world.

1757
03:08:32,566 --> 03:08:34,651
Why do I have to go
to Aquitania?

1758
03:08:34,734 --> 03:08:36,820
'Cause I ask you to.

1759
03:08:36,903 --> 03:08:39,322
It's very good of you, Gracchus,
but I'd rather--

1760
03:08:39,406 --> 03:08:43,326
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.

1761
03:08:43,410 --> 03:08:45,787
Two million?

1762
03:08:45,871 --> 03:08:48,874
Here. Articles of Freedom
for the woman.

1763
03:08:49,958 --> 03:08:52,294
And here's a smaller document
that I've prepared...

1764
03:08:52,377 --> 03:08:55,755
for the child
befitting its size.

1765
03:09:01,136 --> 03:09:03,013
Where are you going?

1766
03:09:05,432 --> 03:09:07,309
To Picenum.

1767
03:09:07,392 --> 03:09:10,395
Picenum?
That's the dreariest town in Italy.

1768
03:09:10,479 --> 03:09:12,355
Will you please leave me?

1769
03:09:13,899 --> 03:09:15,775
Come with us.

1770
03:09:15,859 --> 03:09:18,111
See to it that I don't misuse
the money.

1771
03:09:18,195 --> 03:09:20,322
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a senator.

1772
03:09:20,405 --> 03:09:23,992
Will you please go
before the soldiers come here?

1773
03:09:31,416 --> 03:09:35,003
This would really make
Crassus jealous.

1774
03:09:36,296 --> 03:09:38,381
Go and make
my joy complete.

1775
03:09:38,465 --> 03:09:41,593
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.

1776
03:09:52,270 --> 03:09:54,356
Prettier.

1777
03:10:13,166 --> 03:10:14,835
Halt!

1778
03:10:19,673 --> 03:10:21,675
Identify yourselves, please.

1779
03:10:23,260 --> 03:10:26,596
- Lentulus Batiatus.
- Climb down and identify yourselves.

1780
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:29,558
- I object to that tone.
- I've got my orders.

1781
03:10:29,641 --> 03:10:32,060
Come down
and identify yourselves, please.

1782
03:10:40,110 --> 03:10:43,655
As I told you, I'm Lentulus Batiatus,
the lanista from Capua.

1783
03:10:43,738 --> 03:10:47,826
This--
my sister-in-law.

1784
03:10:51,037 --> 03:10:52,956
Lady, please.

1785
03:10:53,915 --> 03:10:56,626
She's travelling...

1786
03:10:56,710 --> 03:11:00,755
with her child to Aquitania
on a senatorial pass.

1787
03:11:00,839 --> 03:11:04,259
- Take a look through his baggage.
- Not a word, please.

1788
03:11:10,223 --> 03:11:12,142
What did you say?

1789
03:11:55,101 --> 03:11:58,313
- Tell the lady no loitering's allowed.
- Instantly.

1790
03:11:58,396 --> 03:12:00,732
Move on!

1791
03:12:04,611 --> 03:12:06,696
This is your son.

1792
03:12:08,323 --> 03:12:10,450
He's free, Spartacus!

1793
03:12:11,117 --> 03:12:12,994
Free!

1794
03:12:15,121 --> 03:12:17,082
He's free.

1795
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:24,506
He'll remember you, Spartacus.

1796
03:12:25,507 --> 03:12:27,592
Because I'll tell him.

1797
03:12:28,635 --> 03:12:32,013
I'll tell him who his father was
and what he dreamed of!

1798
03:12:35,267 --> 03:12:38,770
Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.

1799
03:12:39,938 --> 03:12:42,023
My love, my life.

1800
03:12:44,609 --> 03:12:47,320
Please die. Die.

1801
03:12:47,404 --> 03:12:50,782
Please, please die, my love.

1802
03:12:50,866 --> 03:12:53,076
Oh, God!
Why can't you die?

1803
03:12:53,160 --> 03:12:55,120
Come on.

1804
03:13:11,219 --> 03:13:14,222
Good-bye, my love, my life.

1805
03:13:14,306 --> 03:13:15,932
Good-bye, good-bye.
