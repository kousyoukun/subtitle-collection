1
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,542
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

2
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:10,654
MY NAME IS JACK POTTER.

3
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:14,462
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE, A P.I., A DICK.

4
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,365
THIS IS MY TOWN, THE CITY OF ANGELS,

5
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:22,108
THE LAND OF SUNSHINE, THE LAND OF MAKE-BELIEVE,

6
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:26,204
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S TOUGH KNOWING WHAT'S REAL

7
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:28,508
AND WHAT'S FAKE.

8
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,348
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS THE TRUTH.

9
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,163
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED.

10
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,275
IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

11
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,834
OH, RYAN.

12
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:47,258
OH, THANK GOD. HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

13
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,818
WELL, FLANAGAN MESSED UP.

14
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,626
THE POSTMARK FROM THE LETTER YOU SUPPOSEDLY SENT

15
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:55,385
IS FROM A BUSINESS, AND HERE I AM.

16
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,657
OH! OH, I'M SO GLAD.

17
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,800
I THOUGHT I'D BE HERE FOREVER.

18
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,247
SORRY, RYAN.

19
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:16,663
IT AMAZES ME HOW YOU CAN BE SMART YET SO STUPID,

20
00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:19,606
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

21
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,622
SO, IT WAS YOU.

22
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,702
YOU KILLED MICHAEL.

23
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:25,430
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS.

24
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,374
HEY!

25
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,196
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THREE THINGS I LEARNED AS A P.I.

26
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,596
NEVER TRUST A DAME,

27
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:39,668
ALWAYS GET IT ON TAPE

28
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:41,364
AND ALWAYS BRING BACKUP.

29
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,251
SHE'S ALL YOURS, FELLAS!

30
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,812
BUT-- OOH!

31
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,539
GET THE TRAMP OUT OF HERE!

32
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:51,571
TOO BAD SHE WAS ROTTEN, HUH, RYAN?

33
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:54,418
COULD'VE HAD A NICE LIFE TOGETHER.

34
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,818
YEAH...

35
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,706
IT'S TOO BAD.

36
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,752
HOW COULD SHE DO THIS TO ME?

37
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:09,809
HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO US?

38
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
THANK YOU!

39
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:19,184
I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TO THE WORLD PREMIERE

40
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,103
OF SHOOTING IN THE DARK,

41
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:24,815
MY DEBUT AS WRITER, DIRECTOR, PRODUCER AND STAR.

42
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,758
THANK YOU.

43
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,647
OKAY, LET'S GO.

44
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:32,750
HOLLYWOOD'S THE LAND OF ILLUSION,

45
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:35,214
AND FOR A LOT OF THESE BOZOS,

46
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:37,294
IT'S THE LAND OF DELUSION.

47
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:39,469
HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

48
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:41,805
HE-HEY, FELLAS! JOHNNY, WHAT'S UP?

49
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,373
HEY, FRANKIE. I'LL CATCH YOU GUYS IN A BIT.

50
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,853
HE-HEY! GUYS! LET ME BUY YOU A DRINK.

51
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:53,036
HEY! HEY!

52
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,700
OH, SWEETIE.

53
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:58,187
IT WAS REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

54
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:00,523
THANKS A LOT FOR COMING, YOU GUYS.

55
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:03,626
WELL, ERNIE, ANY OF THE PEOPLE YOU BROUGHT LIKED MY WORK?

56
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,546
I MEAN, COME ON, MAN.

57
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,011
THEY HAD TO BE SOME OF THE BEST STUFF I'VE EVER DONE.

58
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,890
WELL, I KNOW YOU GAVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT, MARTY.

59
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:13,642
I JUST WANTED TO COME DOWN HERE AND TELL YOU MYSELF.

60
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,857
IT SUCKED.

61
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,017
I MEAN IT REALLY SUCKED.

62
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,833
BUT HEY, DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

63
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:24,616
DON'T BEAT MYSELF UP?

64
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:28,104
ERNIE, I SUNK EVERY LAST DIME I HAD INTO THIS THING.

65
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,312
I EVEN SOLD MY CAR, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

66
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:33,031
YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW, I KNOW. LOOK, I'VE GOT TO GO.

67
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:34,823
HOLD IT!

68
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:37,159
ERNIE, HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO?

69
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:39,463
WELL, I'M GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE,

70
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:41,543
AND YOU'RE GOING TO START LOOKING FOR NEW REPRESENTATION.

71
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:42,694
OKAY?

72
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:43,846
HOLD IT!

73
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,670
HEY.

74
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:46,726
ERNIE, LOOK AT ME.

75
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,229
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

76
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:49,990
I'M CASTABLE. I'M EXTREMELY CASTABLE.

77
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,237
I MEAN IT. LET GO OF ME.

78
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:52,389
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.

79
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,021
REALLY?

80
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,788
THE FIGHT IS OVER, ALL RIGHT?

81
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,932
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOVE THIS POOL CUE UP YOUR FLABBY ASS?

82
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:06,436
OH, NO PROBLEM. I'M GONE.

83
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,459
LOSE MY NUMBER.

84
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,170
OH, SWEETIE, YOUR NOSE.

85
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:16,451
OH, SIT DOWN.

86
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:19,938
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BEAK.

87
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,754
SEE, YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME FRAGMENTED CARTILAGE

88
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:24,769
JAMMED UP THAT FRONTAL LOBE.

89
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,722
WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR YOUR GRAMP STATUS.

90
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:27,778
OW!

91
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,089
ALL RIGHT.

92
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,361
NOW, I CAN STRAIGHTEN OUT THAT SEPTUM

93
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:32,800
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR GOOD LOOKS.

94
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,328
OH, HIS LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON IT.

95
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,321
YOU A PIMP?

96
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:38,304
NO.

97
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:40,032
I'M AN ACTOR.

98
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:41,120
HMM.

99
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,208
THIS IS GOING TO HURT?

100
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,871
NO, IT'S JUST A MINOR ADJUSTMENT.

101
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:45,343
HERE WE GO.

102
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:51,934
CHRIST!

103
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,599
JESUS, THAT HURT!

104
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,422
WELL, YOU SEE, ALL PAIN IS NOT BAD.

105
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:57,662
SOMETIMES THAT'S HOW WE LEARN.

106
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,134
SEE YOU AROUND, KID.

107
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:04,829
OH, SWEETIE. OW!

108
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,940
WHO WAS THAT?

109
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,309
JACK POTTER. HE'S BEEN A REGULAR HERE FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

110
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,644
HE'S A PRIVATE EYE.

111
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:13,212
NO SHIT?

112
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,556
WHAT, YOU MEAN THE REAL THING?

113
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:17,372
THE REAL DEAL.

114
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:20,763
I DEAL IN THE TRUTH.

115
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,811
SOMETIMES THE TRUTH HURTS BAD.

116
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,603
WHEN YOU GET UP AT NIGHT TO TAKE A LEAK

117
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,098
AND CRACK YOUR TOE ON THE EDGE OF THE FRIGGING BED.

118
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,075
JESUS, THAT HURTS.

119
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:32,026
I KEEP AN OFFICE ON HOLLYWOOD AND VINE,

120
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:35,258
A SEEDY PART OF TOWN BUT 10 OR 20 YEARS AGO

121
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,137
WAS A SEEDY PART OF TOWN.

122
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,665
THE ONLY THING ANYBODY EVER DISCOVERED HERE

123
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:43,385
IS THE HOOKER THEY JUST PAID HAS A PENIS.

124
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,616
POTTER, MORRIS AND MANN.

125
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,304
BUT I WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCOVERED BY THE KID.

126
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:57,048
HIS NAME IS MARTY MACKENZIE,

127
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,543
ANOTHER ACTOR WITH EMPTY POCKETS

128
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:03,095
AND A HEAD FILLED WITH DREAMS OF STARDOM.

129
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,262
HE WROTE HIS OWN PLAY, A DETECTIVE STORY,

130
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,302
BUT MARTY DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE.

131
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,150
THAT'S WHAT SET INTO MY DOOR.

132
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:15,925
COME IN!

133
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,557
HOLLYWOOD AND 603 BROADWAY...

134
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,221
SUSPECT IS A WHITE HERMAPHRODITE

135
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:20,885
DRESSED IN A BLACK HOCKEY JERSEY

136
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,292
WITH MATCHING PLEATED SKIRT, OVER.

137
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:24,596
UH, HEY. POTTER?

138
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:27,764
YOU REMEMBER ME, THE BLOODY NOSE FROM LAST NIGHT?

139
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:30,836
THE NAME IS MR. POTTER OR JACK.

140
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,787
I'M POTTER TO THOSE I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME

141
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,595
OR WHO CAN WHIP MY ASS. NOW, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

142
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:40,147
UM, MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME OUT.

143
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:42,163
THAT'S MY JOB, HELPING OUT PEOPLE FOR A PRICE, OF COURSE.

144
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,858
SO, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

145
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,201
YOUR OLD LADY FUCKING SOMEBODY ELSE?

146
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,274
NO.

147
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:52,465
I'M DOING RESEARCH FOR MY NEW DETECTIVE PLAY.

148
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:54,800
TEACH ME HOW A REAL P.I. WORKS, MR. POTTER.

149
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,528
PLEASE, I--

150
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,280
YOU KNOW, I'D MAKE A GREAT DETECTIVE, AND YOU KNOW WHY?

151
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,648
BECAUSE I JUST PLAYED ONE IN THIS REALLY COOL PLAY,

152
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,280
AND I TORE IT UP.

153
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,423
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP, SO YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

154
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,376
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARTNERS?

155
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,327
DO THEY NEED ANY HELP?

156
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,951
I WORK ALONE.

157
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:14,158
WELL, CAN I AT LEAST FILL OUT AN APPLICATION?

158
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,982
UH, YEAH.

159
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,318
HERE'S AN APPLICATION.

160
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,229
PUT YOUR NAME AND NUMBER DOWN THERE,

161
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,053
AND IF I NEED YOU, I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

162
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,941
YOU WON'T REGRET HIRING ME.

163
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:33,037
HERE'S MY NAME AND MY NUMBER ON THERE, AND PLEASE.

164
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:34,892
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING, GIVE ME A CALL.

165
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:37,196
SEE YOU AROUND.

166
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,652
YEAH.

167
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:43,755
OH, THE... YOUR PEN.

168
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:55,434
MARTY DIDN'T KNOW DICK ABOUT BEING A DICK.

169
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,930
THE CRITICS MURDERED HIS PLAY,

170
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:01,193
HIS AGENT GAVE HIM THE OLD FIVE-KNUCKLE NOSE JOB,

171
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,953
THEN HIS GIRLFRIEND DUMPED HIM FOR HER GIRLFRIEND.

172
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,745
MARTY WAS ON A ROLL...

173
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:06,569
EVICTED.

174
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,712
DOWNHILL.

175
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,103
ANYTHING ELSE, SPORT?

176
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:22,055
UH, A LITTLE WATER?

177
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,103
NO, THANKS.

178
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:26,054
OH, HERE HE IS. HEY, JACK.

179
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,934
HI, NICK.

180
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,878
MR. POTTER!

181
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,613
LOOK, MR. POTTER...

182
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:40,357
MR. POTTER, I--

183
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,277
I GOT NOBODY.

184
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:46,052
I HAVE NO MONEY, NO PLACE TO GO,

185
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,772
NOWHERE.

186
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:50,404
LOOK, I'LL DO ANYTHING.

187
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:52,771
I'LL SCRUB YOUR FLOORS, I'LL MOP YOUR CEILINGS,

188
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:54,595
I'LL CLEAN YOUR TOILET,

189
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:58,211
I'LL EVEN KISS YOUR ASS, IF YOU PLEASE

190
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:02,114
JUST LET ME SLEEP ON THAT UGLY GREEN COUCH OF YOURS,

191
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:05,346
AND I'LL WORK FOR FREE.

192
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:09,762
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

193
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,265
A DRINK.

194
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,160
THAT TASTES LIKE PEPSI.

195
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:27,968
IT IS PEPSI.

196
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,215
ULCERS.

197
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,814
SO, I TOSSED THE KID A BREAK.

198
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:41,630
I GAVE HIM A TW0-WEEK TEST DRIVE TO SEE IF HE COULD CUT IT,

199
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:45,213
AND DON'T CALL ME SOFTIE. THE VIAGRA FIXED THAT.

200
00:12:46,621 --> 00:12:48,990
SHIT.

201
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,389
JESUS CHRIST.

202
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,821
THIS PEN ALMOST TOOK MY FINGER OFF.

203
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:55,420
NOT A PEN.

204
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:58,332
FROM THE GODFATHER. IT COMES IN HANDY

205
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:01,468
WHEN SOME MUGGER WANTS YOUR AUTOGRAPH.

206
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,835
NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO QUIT PLAYING WITH MY SHIT.

207
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,811
SORRY. I WAS JUST WRITING A NOTE THAT I WAS GOING OUT FOR A BURGER.

208
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:13,018
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU ONE?

209
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,578
NO. I'VE GOT TO GO OVER TO THE NUTHOUSE IN PASADENA,

210
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,042
SERVE A PAPER ON ONE OF THE WOO-WOOS OVER THERE.

211
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:20,825
I'LL BE GONE FOR AN HOUR OR TWO.

212
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:23,225
UH, HEY, JACK.

213
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:24,825
CAN I GO WITH YOU?

214
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:26,585
WHAT FOR?

215
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,657
YOU NEVER LET ME DO ANY REAL DETECTIVE WORK.

216
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:31,577
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A REAL DETECTIVE.

217
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:34,232
COME ON, POTTER. LET ME GO.

218
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:35,512
I SWEAR I WILL NOT GET IN THE WAY.

219
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:37,624
IT'S MR. POTTER OR JACK.

220
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:40,120
RIGHT. SORRY.

221
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,880
WELL, CAN I GO?

222
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:44,727
MARTY, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU THIS.

223
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,223
IT'S NOT WORKING OUT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE.

224
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:54,262
LEAVE? BUT, BUT JACK, I--

225
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:55,862
I'VE BEEN WORKING REAL HARD. I'VE BEEN MOPPING AND--

226
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:59,349
YOU'VE BEEN DOING FINE. IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

227
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,229
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY DESPERATE, BURNT OUT

228
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:04,917
END-OF-THE-LINE CHARACTER IN TOWN.

229
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,772
I HAVEN'T HAD A CASE FOR WEEKS.

230
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,988
I THINK MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BUY THAT BAIT AND TACKLE SHOP

231
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,539
OUT IN THE FLORIDA KEYS AND...

232
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:17,427
SEMI-RETIRE.

233
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:20,723
BUT--

234
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,579
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CASES AT ALL?

235
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:29,138
LISTEN, THERE IS THIS CASE.

236
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,770
THE GUY'S WIFE, A REAL SLUT.

237
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,041
SHE'S SCREWING AROUND WITH SOME LOCAL STUD UP IN THIS

238
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,657
HALF-ASSED LITTLE TOWN UP IN OREGON CALLED BEAVER RIDGE.

239
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,417
HE WANTS ME TO GO UP THERE AND GET THE GOODS ON HER,

240
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:39,985
SO HE CAN DIVORCE HER CHEATING ASS.

241
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:42,801
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE CASE

242
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:45,584
BECAUSE I'M SICK OF DEALING WITH ADULTEROUS SWINE.

243
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,504
BUT JACK--

244
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:49,039
LET ME DO IT.

245
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,032
OH, YEAH--

246
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:51,248
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

247
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,464
LOOK, YOU CAN STAY HOME,

248
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,319
PLAY POOL AND DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU DO.

249
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,727
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

250
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,999
SO, TEACH ME. I'M A QUICK LEARNER.

251
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:07,277
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A SURVEILLANCE VAN

252
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,838
THAT WAS TOP OF THE LINE WHEN I BOUGHT IT, AND I LOVE IT.

253
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,461
I CALL IT THE GOOD OLD BOY.

254
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:14,509
NOW, A DETECTIVE THAT'S UP TO HIS SNUFF,

255
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,357
HE HAS THE PROPER TOOLS, AND HE'S GOT THE PROPER DRESS.

256
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:18,829
NOW, THESE EARRINGS-- OW!

257
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,108
THAT'S GOT TO COME OUT OF THERE.

258
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,324
I'LL DO IT!

259
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:23,691
WELL, TAKE IT OUT!

260
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,635
IF YOU'RE PIERCED ANYWHERE ELSE, THAT'S GOT TO GO, TOO.

261
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,243
HEY, BITCHIN' SLIT BACK.

262
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:39,818
AH. DON'T FOOL WITH MY SHIT.

263
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,378
NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THREE THINGS.

264
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,842
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A CAMERA, TAPE RECORDER AND A SHOTGUN MIKE.

265
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:46,281
WELL, JACK, WHAT ABOUT A GUN?

266
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:47,593
NO.

267
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,585
FOR PROTECTION?

268
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:49,801
NO!

269
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,592
HEY, THIS IS COOL.

270
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,577
OKAY LEAVE MY SHIT ALONE! PUT THAT BACK UP THERE.

271
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:58,216
YEAH, YOU DO NEED SOMETHING.

272
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:01,031
HERE, MACE.

273
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,439
IN CASE YOU RUN ACROSS

274
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:06,119
ANY GIANT KILLER BEAVERS IN BEAVER RIDGE.

275
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:07,783
NOW, WHEN YOU GET UP THERE,

276
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:09,255
YOU CHECK IN WITH THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT,

277
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:11,111
SO THAT THEY WON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE SOME

278
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:14,822
OUT OF TOWN DOPE DEALER WHEN THEY CATCH YOU SNOOPING AROUND.

279
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,510
SO, LET'S GET OUT ON THE FIELD

280
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,518
AND ACQUIRE SOME SKILLS.

281
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,397
I TOOK MARTY TO A STAKEOUT

282
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,084
AT A MAKE OUT MOTEL IN MAUI,

283
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,805
DUMPED WITH TEFLON SHEETS AND A TWO-CONDOM MINIMUM.

284
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,148
FIRST THING YOU DO IS, YOU TAKE YOURSELF A PICTURE

285
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,099
OF THE TWO OF THEM GOING INSIDE.

286
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:37,796
TAKE A PICTURE OF THEM, JUST FOR PRACTICE.

287
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:38,819
NOW, BEFORE THEY GET INSIDE--

288
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:42,499
THAT'S ENOUGH. ONE PICTURE IS ENOUGH.

289
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,475
ALL RIGHT.

290
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:48,003
NOW, WE'VE GOT THE TAPE RECORDER GOING.

291
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:49,442
OKAY.

292
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,202
MAYBE YOU'LL HEAR THEM SAYING EACH OTHER'S NAMES.

293
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,825
THERE, NOW SEE...

294
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:58,721
OH, YEAH.

295
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:01,793
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

296
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:03,745
IT MAKES ME GO HARD.

297
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,248
LOOKS LIKE THAT'S HER HUSBAND.

298
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,495
SOMEONE BROKE THE CARDINAL RULE.

299
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,671
"YOU MUST NEVER TELL THE CLIENT

300
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:14,559
WHERE THE STAKEOUT IS GOING TO BE."

301
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:15,840
CALM DOWN!

302
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:17,183
COME ON!

303
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,679
GET OUT OF MY FACE! MY WIFE'S IN THERE!

304
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,726
COME ON, HONEY!

305
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,871
THAT'S WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN.

306
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,790
JESUS.

307
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:32,541
HEY, THOSE ARE MY TITS! I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THOSE!

308
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,493
YOU STILL WANT TO BE A PRIVATE EYE?

309
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:35,965
OH, YEAH.

310
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,468
JACK, I'M READY.

311
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:40,476
ALL RIGHT.

312
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:45,276
HERE ARE THE KEYS TO MY CHERRY CHEVELLE.

313
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:46,844
WOW.

314
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,732
JUST A MINUTE.

315
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:53,371
DON'T YOU SCRATCH THAT PAINT, KID.

316
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:56,795
THE NEXT MORNING, I POINTED MARTY NORTH WITH FINGERS CROSSED.

317
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,002
WITH ONLY A DAY OF TRAINING UNDER HIS BELT,

318
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,146
I WAS WORRIED.

319
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:03,962
I LOVED THAT CAR.

320
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:08,825
♪♪

321
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:22,360
THE KID WASN'T PLAY-ACTING ANYMORE.

322
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,311
HE WAS WORKING A REAL CASE,

323
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:28,375
THE CASE OF INFIDELITY, LUST, FOOLING AROUND.

324
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,222
YOU KNOW, HUMPING.

325
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,253
AS MARTY DROVE NORTH, THE WEATHER WENT SOUTH.

326
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,333
FROM 'FRISCO TO OREGON,

327
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:47,637
THE SKY WAS WETTER THAN A FAT STRIPPER'S THONG.

328
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:00,787
I'M STARVING.

329
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,099
IS THERE A CANDY MACHINE AROUND HERE OR SOMETHING?

330
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:04,307
UH-HUH.

331
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:06,675
OH, HEY. THERE YOU ARE.

332
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:08,658
ATTA GIRL. HI.

333
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:21,073
JESUS.

334
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,392
ISN'T THAT THING DANGEROUS?

335
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,664
ONLY IF HE BITES YOU.

336
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:39,919
AFTER A LONG NIGHT ON A SHORT MATTRESS,

337
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:42,223
MARTY WAS UP WITH THE BIRDS, HEADING INTO TOWN.

338
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:48,462
BEAVER RIDGE-- SMALL TOWN, USA.

339
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,500
NORMAN ROCKWELL CAN EAT ME.

340
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:05,836
PEOPLE ARE FREAKS, DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE,

341
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:09,803
AND BEAVER RIDGE IS NO EXCEPTION.

342
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:12,652
THE GUIDEBOOK SAYS THE NAME BEAVER RIDGE

343
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:14,443
COMES FROM THE INDIANS,

344
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:16,907
BUT THE LOCAL LUMBERJACKS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY.

345
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,794
SOMETHING ABOUT A POORLY RUN GIRL'S SCHOOL

346
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:21,578
THAT USED TO BE UP IN THE HILL.

347
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,617
GOOD MORNING.

348
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,889
AH, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

349
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:37,001
UH, I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOUR SHERIFF WAS IN.

350
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,976
SHERIFF!

351
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:41,640
SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU, BY GOD!

352
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:44,104
HOLD YOUR DAMN HORSES, CHARLIE!

353
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:49,896
THANK YOU.

354
00:20:58,183 --> 00:21:00,038
YOU THE ONE HERE TO SEE ME?

355
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,118
YES, SIR.

356
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,742
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

357
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:06,757
UH, I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN WITH YOU

358
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:08,165
AND LET YOU KNOW I'M IN TOWN.

359
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:10,437
MY NAME'S MARTY MACKENZIE.

360
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,965
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE FROM LOS ANGELES,

361
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:14,853
AND I'M JUST HERE, WORKING ON A CASE.

362
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:17,029
NOTHING-- NOTHING SERIOUS,

363
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,884
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'D JUST LIKE YOUR COOPERATION,

364
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,292
IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS, YOU KNOW.

365
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:22,724
WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE NO PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

366
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:24,675
WHAT YOU INVESTIGATING, BOY?

367
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,787
UH, WELL, IT'S JUST AN ADULTERY CASE.

368
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,579
I, I REALLY CAN'T TELL YOU MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

369
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,242
DON'T YOU THINK FOLKS' PRIVATE BUSINESS

370
00:21:34,274 --> 00:21:35,938
IS THEIR OWN PRIVATE BUSINESS?

371
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,466
WELL, SIR, IT'S JUST MY JOB.

372
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,385
WHAT'S YOUR JOB? SNEAKING AROUND, PEEKING AROUND,

373
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:42,305
SEEING WHO'S DIDDLING WHO? THAT AIN'T NO JOB.

374
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:43,841
THAT'S A PERVERSION, BOY.

375
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:48,512
WELL, I SHOULD ONLY BE IN TOWN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

376
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:49,857
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

377
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,712
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE TOWN RIGHT NOW.

378
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,880
YOU AIN'T GOT NO BUSINESS HERE. SEE, FOLKS AROUND HERE,

379
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:58,271
WE DON'T LIKE NO ONE, EXCEPT FOR OURSELVES.

380
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:05,215
WELL, SHERIFF, I CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL I DO MY JOB. IT'S...

381
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:11,838
EXCUSE ME.

382
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,110
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD MAYBE

383
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,574
KEEP MY PRESENCE HERE, YOU KNOW, QUIET.

384
00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:18,493
OH, WE AIN'T GOING TO TELL ANYBODY.

385
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:23,580
WELL, THANKS.

386
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:28,828
IT HAD BEEN A HALF AN HOUR SINCE MARTY ATE BREAKFAST,

387
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,155
SO HE WENT FOR A BITE AT BUD'S, A GREASY SPOON

388
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:34,460
WHERE THE LOCALS GATHERED TO CHEW THE FAT.

389
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:52,185
WHEN IN ROME, DO LIKE THE ROMANS;

390
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:54,713
BUT MARTY WASN'T IN ROME.

391
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:56,889
ROME'S IN ITALY.

392
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,872
PSST.

393
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,240
YOU'RE THAT POLICEMAN FROM DOWN SOUTH, AIN'T YOU?

394
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,519
NO, NO, NO. I'M JUST A TOURIST.

395
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:14,071
NO. I HEARD YOU'RE HERE, INVESTIGATING.

396
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:17,174
NO, NO.

397
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:18,838
YOU KNOW, THAT IS SOME BEAUTIFUL WEATHER

398
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:20,182
YOU'RE HAVING OUT THERE, HUH?

399
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,830
HI. UM, CAN I JUST GET

400
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,581
A CUP OF COFFEE AND THREE DOUGHNUTS?

401
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,949
ANYTHING FOR A GOVERNMENT MAN.

402
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:31,125
I'M, I'M NOT A GOVERNMENT...

403
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,908
THE PORCUPINES IS TOO BIG AROUND HERE.

404
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,835
REALLY?

405
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:48,883
THAT'S INTERESTING.

406
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:51,507
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOME TOP SECRET INFORMATION,

407
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,587
BUT IT'S TOP SECRET.

408
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:56,146
SO, IF IT GOES ANY FURTHER,

409
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,714
YOU'RE A GODDAMN LIAR.

410
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,866
OKAY.

411
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:07,217
THERE AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE NO NUCLEAR TESTING AROUND HERE,

412
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:08,881
BUT THEY DO IT ANYHOW.

413
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:12,689
THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING.

414
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,448
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE,

415
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,360
BUT IT'S TOP, TOP SECRET.

416
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:19,440
ME AND MY OLD MAN, WE SEEN A TWO-HEADED MULE THE OTHER DAY,

417
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:22,575
RIGHT UP ON THAT RIDGE, SOUTH OF TOWN.

418
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:26,894
JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW, BEING A GOVERNMENT SPY AND ALL.

419
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:31,631
THANK YOU.

420
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:37,678
WITH A BELLY FULL OF DOUGHNUTS,

421
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,845
HE TRACKED DOWN DIANE'S HOUSE AND SETTLED IN.

422
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:43,309
THE OLD WAITING GAME:

423
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,549
SECOND WORST PART OF THE GIG.

424
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,372
THE WORST IS WHEN YOU GET YOUR BUTT CHEEKS RIPPED OFF

425
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,357
BY PIT BULL WITH TOURETTE'S.

426
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,052
THAT REALLY SUCKS.

427
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,875
OKAY, DIANE.

428
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,795
TAKE ME TO YOUR LOVE NEST.

429
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:23,657
FROM A SAFE DISTANCE, HE TAILED DIANE WITH HIS HEADLIGHTS OFF,

430
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,720
WHICH IS A GOOD WAY TO HIT A DEER, BUST UP MY GRILL WORK.

431
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:30,184
KNUCKLEHEAD.

432
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,372
OH, IF JACK COULD SEE ME NOW.

433
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:10,627
WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS KIND OF FUN

434
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:13,347
SINCE WE GOT MARRIED. IT'S LIKE WE'RE KIDS AGAIN!

435
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:14,723
MARRIED?

436
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:17,442
IT'S SO ROMANTIC.

437
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,618
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME REAL LOVING?

438
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,898
OOH, OOH! DEEPER, DEEPER!

439
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:30,177
UNTIE THE KNOT AND GIVE ME MORE ROPE.

440
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,745
HERE COMES MORE ROPE, BABY.

441
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:34,528
OH! I SAID MORE ROPE!

442
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,888
THAT'S ALL THE ROPE I HAVE, DIANE.

443
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,887
IT WAS ALL TOO EASY, EXCEPT FOR ONE LITTLE DETAIL.

444
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,223
WHILE DIANE WAS GETTING LAID--

445
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:46,143
OH, GOD. HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!

446
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:49,215
SOMEONE ELSE WAS GETTING FUCKED.

447
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:59,838
OH, DEEPER, DEEPER.

448
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,461
OH, YES. YES.

449
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,501
PLEASE, DON'T! DON'T!

450
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:08,316
UH!

451
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,843
THE KID'S NERVES HELD,

452
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,051
ALTHOUGH HE DID WASTE HALF A ROLL OF FILM

453
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:27,291
TAKING PICTURES OF HIS MICROPHONE.

454
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,570
GET HOME. BYE.

455
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,076
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE, BOY?

456
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:26,355
YOU DO THIS?

457
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,796
NO.

458
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:29,843
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

459
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,115
I'M WORKING ON MY CASE.

460
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:34,867
YOU MEAN THAT ADULTERY THING?

461
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,755
YEAH.

462
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:38,034
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

463
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,243
I'M THE DAMN SHERIFF OF THIS TOWN.

464
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:42,258
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK I'M DOING HERE?

465
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,730
I'M INVESTIGATING!

466
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:46,546
SHERIFF, I THINK THAT I HEARD SOMEONE BEING MURDERED OUT HERE.

467
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:48,978
I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

468
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,961
I AIN'T GOT TIME TO DEAL WITH WHAT YOU THINK YOU HEARD.

469
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:52,465
NOW, I'LL TAKE YOUR STATEMENT IN THE MORNING.

470
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,065
NOW, GET!

471
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:55,760
OKAY. SURE. HEY, I UNDERSTAND.

472
00:28:55,793 --> 00:28:58,512
I'M IN THE INVESTIGATING BUSINESS MYSELF.

473
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:11,343
SON OF A BITCH.

474
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,071
MORE ROPE.

475
00:29:13,102 --> 00:29:14,766
OH, HERE COMES MORE ROPE, BABY.

476
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,190
OH. I SAID MORE ROPE!

477
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:19,886
THAT'S ALL THE ROPE I HAVE, DIANE.

478
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:24,813
OH, DEEPER, DEEPER. DEEPER.

479
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,277
OH, YEAH. YEAH.

480
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,581
OH, MORE! DEEPER!

481
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,596
OKAY. HERE IT COMES.

482
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:46,026
SHIT.

483
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:47,915
THE TAPE RAN OUT.

484
00:29:54,218 --> 00:29:56,585
YEAH, HOLD ON!

485
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:01,993
YOU ON DRUGS, BOY?

486
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:04,105
WHAT?

487
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,921
I SAID, YOU ON DRUGS?

488
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,896
NO. SHERIFF, NO. I, I JUST--

489
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:11,912
I WAS UP MOST OF THE NIGHT.

490
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,504
I COMPLETED MY INVESTIGATION

491
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:16,584
ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, DOWN AT THE GRAVEL PIT.

492
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:19,239
SOMEBODY WAS KILLED, ALL RIGHT, BUT IT WASN'T MURDER.

493
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:21,447
SEEMS THE FOREMAN AT THAT PLACE

494
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:24,103
HAD A LITTLE GRUDGE AGAINST THE OWNER, MR. PALM.

495
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,246
TRIED TO BLOW THE PLACE UP BUT KILLED HIMSELF INSTEAD.

496
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,318
AIN'T NOTHING LEFT OF HIM BUT LITTLE BITTY PIECES NOW.

497
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,166
NOW, YOU GOT YOUR BUSINESS DONE.

498
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,437
I'D LIKE YOU TO GET THE HELL OUT OF MY TOWN.

499
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:37,606
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY, BOY.

500
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:42,757
LET'S GET SOME FRIES.

501
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:51,107
WHILE MARTY WAS GETTING HIS WAKEUP CALL,

502
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,123
I WAS OUT MAKING A CALL OF MY OWN

503
00:30:53,156 --> 00:30:55,043
ON A REAL ESTATE BROKER.

504
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:57,763
HAD A LEAD ON A NICE SPOT ON THE BEACH IN FLORIDA.

505
00:30:57,795 --> 00:31:01,858
THOUGHT I COULD HAVE IT FOR A SONG AND $410,000.

506
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,746
POTTER, I MEAN JACK, HEY, IT'S ME, MARTY.

507
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:10,018
I GOT THE DIRT ON DIANE,

508
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:11,617
BUT THE GUY SHE'S DOING IS HER HUSBAND.

509
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,977
SHE'S NOT A SLUT, JUST KINKY.

510
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,737
OH, AND JACK,

511
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:20,000
I STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING BIG, REALLY BIG.

512
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,952
LOOK, I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE BEING MURDERED.

513
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:23,520
KID, YOUR PIZZA'S READY!

514
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:25,088
LOOK, GOTTA GO, JACK.

515
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,616
I WONDER WHAT THAT LITTLE PECKER IS UP TO.

516
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:02,268
JACK!

517
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,876
JACK, ARE YOU OKAY?

518
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:10,907
JESUS, YOU SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME!

519
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:19,642
JACK, CAN YOU TALK YET?

520
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,441
JACK.

521
00:32:26,297 --> 00:32:28,089
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYWAY?

522
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:30,713
I DROVE UP TO SEE YOU.

523
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:32,856
I SAW YOU IN MY CAR, FOLLOWED IT

524
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,768
AND GOT MACED BY A SHITHEAD.

525
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,911
YEAH, THE STUFF REALLY WORKS.

526
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:39,575
NO KIDDING.

527
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:49,974
WELL, HERE.

528
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,991
I MADE YOU THIS.

529
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:54,102
I THINK IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

530
00:32:58,198 --> 00:33:02,325
JACK, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT.

531
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,853
THE WEIRDEST THING HAPPENED.

532
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:07,285
WHILE I WAS UP THERE RECORDING THEM

533
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:10,100
GOING AT IT LIKE JACKRABBITS,

534
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:12,372
JACK, I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE BEING MURDERED.

535
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:14,995
YOU GET THAT ON TAPE, THE MURDER?

536
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:17,683
DAMN IT, I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO ASK ME THAT.

537
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:20,211
NO, NO. THE TAPE RAN OUT, BUT LISTEN, JACK, I'M TELLING YOU--

538
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:21,875
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK HAPPENED.

539
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:24,467
YOU FELL ASLEEP OUT THERE AND THEN HAD A BAD DREAM,

540
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,218
AND YOU WOKE UP, AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR TEDDY BEAR,

541
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,618
AND IT WAS COLD AND SCARY AND DARK,

542
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,209
AND YOU WERE GOING TO PIDDLE IN YOUR PANTS.

543
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:33,970
JACK, I KNOW WHAT I HEARD.

544
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:36,369
LOOK, I HAD MY EARPHONES ON, OKAY,

545
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:37,841
AND I'M POINTING THE SHOTGUN MIKE LIKE THIS,

546
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:39,985
AND I HEARD SOMEONE SAY, "OH, MY GOD--"

547
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,200
I'LL TAKE HIM OUT FIRST, THEN THE GUY IN THE BACK.

548
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:42,832
SHIT!

549
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:44,785
AH!

550
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:51,248
JACK! YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN NOW?

551
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,719
SHUT UP!

552
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,438
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

553
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,613
WELL, WE'LL LOOK INTO IT...

554
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:12,109
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

555
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:13,997
I MEAN, IT COULD'VE BEEN JUST ABOUT ANYBODY.

556
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,533
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, TOMMY?

557
00:34:15,564 --> 00:34:17,453
JUST ABOUT ANYBODY.

558
00:34:17,484 --> 00:34:19,404
YOU SEE, FOLKS AROUND HERE

559
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:21,260
LIKE TO MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

560
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,668
THEY DON'T LIKE STRANGERS COMING AROUND

561
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,492
MINDING THEIR BUSINESS FOR THEM.

562
00:34:24,524 --> 00:34:27,116
DOES MAKE THEM ALL EXCITABLE

563
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:29,292
TO TAKE THE LAW IN THEIR OWN HANDS.

564
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:30,795
SPEAKING OF THAT,

565
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,619
AIN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OF HERE BY NOW, TENDERFOOT?

566
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:34,506
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO BE LEAVING THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,

567
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,074
SHERIFF OWENS. YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

568
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,675
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

569
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:38,922
YEAH.

570
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,546
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. COME ON, TOMMY.

571
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,857
THAT'S IT? WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET UP AND LEAVE?

572
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:57,128
YEAH. CRAZY, ISN'T IT?

573
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,624
ONE HOUR IN TOWN, AND I'VE BEEN MACED,

574
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:01,672
SHOT AT AND HARASSED BY THE LOCAL POLICE,

575
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:05,223
AND HERE I AM, ALREADY WANTING TO LEAVE.

576
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:07,431
HEY, YOU GO FIGURE IT.

577
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,095
JACK, COME ON.

578
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:11,558
AREN'T YOU THE LEAST BIT CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON?

579
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,942
MARTY, YOU ACCIDENTALLY STEPPED INTO A BIG PILE OF SHIT.

580
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:18,565
NOW, WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU LIFT UP YOUR LEG,

581
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:20,997
AND YOU SCRAPE THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE, AND YOU WALK ON.

582
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:22,821
YOU DON'T HANG AROUND HERE JUST HOPPING UP AND DOWN

583
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,541
ON THAT SHIT BECAUSE YOU FIND IT FUCKING CURIOUS.

584
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,237
THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT'S CURIOUS

585
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:29,605
IS WHERE'S YOUR NEXT PAY CHECK COMING FROM, CAPISCE?

586
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:32,484
YEAH, JACK. I CAPISCE.

587
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:34,979
YOU GOT SHOT AT, AND NOW YOU'RE SCARED.

588
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:40,259
LOOK, KID.

589
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:44,003
YOU KNOW WHAT A BULLET CAN DO TO A HUMAN BODY?

590
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:46,435
YEAH, JACK. I SAW TERMINATOR.

591
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:49,538
YOU'RE SO FUCKING IGNORANT, IT'S PATHETIC.

592
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:51,586
THOSE WERE ANDROIDS.

593
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:54,242
YOU KNOW WHAT'S PATHETIC, JACK? YOU'RE PATHETIC.

594
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:55,745
OH, YEAH?

595
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,665
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SO COOL WHEN I FIRST MET YOU.

596
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,169
YOU KNOW THAT?

597
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,321
I GUESS IT WAS ALL JUST AN ACT, HUH?

598
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:04,960
DICK TRACY HERE, TALKING TO ME ABOUT PUTTING ON AN ACT.

599
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,656
JACK, WHERE'S THE FIRE IN YOUR BELLY

600
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:08,544
I GOT FIRE IN MY BELLY.

601
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:11,392
THAT'S WHY I TAKE THESE.

602
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,192
YOU KNOW WHAT?

603
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,303
WHATEVER.

604
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:20,063
I'M GOING TO TAKE A SHOWER.

605
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:24,798
PECKER.

606
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,934
HAVE NO FIRE IN MY BELLY.

607
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:35,325
SOON YOU FORGET WHAT THE REAL STUFF TASTES LIKE.

608
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,308
HELLO.

609
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,996
MARTY'S UNAVAILABLE.

610
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:47,419
JACK POTTER. I'M HIS BOSS.

611
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:50,939
MR. POND, UH-HUH? UH-HUH.

612
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:54,619
THE POND GRAVEL COMPANY--

613
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,603
YOU GIVE US A BIG ROCK,

614
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:58,938
WE'LL GIVE YOU LOTS OF LITTLE ROCKS.

615
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,370
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS PLACE BEFORE I GOT A HOLD OF IT.

616
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:03,641
IT WAS A WILDERNESS, NOTHING BUT TREES

617
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:06,106
AND DEERS AND RABBITS.

618
00:37:06,138 --> 00:37:08,026
NOW, LOOK AT IT.

619
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:09,625
QUITE A TRANSFORMATION, MR. POND.

620
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:12,249
YEAH. ONE DAY, IT WILL ALL BE CINDERS.

621
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,881
COME ON, SWEETHEART. LET'S MOVE THIS BUGGY.

622
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:15,289
OH, I GOT IT.

623
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,233
YEAH, TRANSFORMATION. THAT'S THE WORD FOR IT.

624
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:20,216
NOW SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO TAKE IT ALL AWAY FROM ME.

625
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:22,552
ANY IDEA WHO THAT MIGHT BE?

626
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,440
WELL, HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

627
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,583
THAT'S WHAT I'M HIRING YOU BOYS FOR.

628
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:29,175
WHEN THE SHERIFF FIRST TOLD ME ABOUT YOU, I THOUGHT, YEAH.

629
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:31,671
SO, WHY DID YOU HIRE US?

630
00:37:31,703 --> 00:37:34,166
WHEN SHERIFF OWENS TOLD ME YOU WERE NO GOOD,

631
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:37,046
I KNEW YOU WERE RIGHT FOR THE JOB.

632
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:40,182
ANYTHING TO PISS OFF OWENS.

633
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:42,645
WELL, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING, MR. POND.

634
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:43,925
COULD YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE MAN WHO WAS KILLED,

635
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:46,645
WHAT'S HIS NAME, DANNY HARKNESS?

636
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:50,517
YEAH, DANNY HARKNESS, UNGRATEFUL LITTLE NO ACCOUNT TURD.

637
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:53,684
GIVE HIM A JOB, AND HE'LL STILL SUCK A TIT.

638
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:57,043
OH, NOW, HE WASN'T ONE OF THE BEAVER RIDGE HARKNESSES.

639
00:37:57,076 --> 00:37:59,059
NO, HE'D COME FROM THAT DEGENERATE BUNCH OF HARKNESSES,

640
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:01,139
LIVED UP IN TRUSSBERG.

641
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:03,379
THEY'RE INTO IN-BREEDING, WIFE-SWAPPING AND DEVIL WORSHIP.

642
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:05,299
EVERYBODY IN BEAVER RIDGE THINKS THEY'RE REALLY WEIRD.

643
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,818
WELL, IF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE THINK THEY'RE WEIRD,

644
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,546
THAT PLACE MUST BE UP THE CHARTS.

645
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:14,802
SORRY.

646
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,818
IF DANNY HARKNESS WAS TRYING TO DRIVE YOU OUT OF BUSINESS,

647
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,433
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF HIS ACCOMPLICES DOUBLE-CROSSED HIM.

648
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,448
YEAH, THE SHERIFF.

649
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:24,209
YEAH, WELL, I WOULDN'T PUT ANYTHING PAST ALTON OWENS;

650
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:26,192
BUT THEN, I WOULDN'T PUT ANYTHING PAST ANYBODY

651
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:29,072
IN THIS GODFORSAKEN SHIT HOLE OF A TOWN.

652
00:38:29,104 --> 00:38:31,792
I MADE THIS TOWN.

653
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:34,512
NOW, THEY TURN ON ME LIKE A PACK OF BLOODTHIRSTY WOLVES.

654
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:38,735
I TOOK CARE OF THEIR PROBLEMS,

655
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:41,423
TREATED THEM LIKE THEY WERE MY OWN CHILDREN.

656
00:38:41,455 --> 00:38:44,623
HEY, TANNER! GOD DAMN IT!

657
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,214
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND, I SEE YOU DRINKING SOMETHING!

658
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:49,102
NOW, YOU DRINK ON YOUR OWN GODDAMN TIME!

659
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:50,702
YOU HEAR ME? YOU HUMP BACK ON THAT RIG,

660
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:52,910
AND YOU START MOVING SOME DIRT! YOU HEAR ME?

661
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:55,085
GOD DAMN IT, TANNER! YOU HEAR ME?

662
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:56,557
BASTARD.

663
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:59,085
UH, MR. POND-- WHAT?

664
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,837
WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF YOUR COMPANY?

665
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:04,652
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO HORACE JUNIOR ABOUT THAT.

666
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:11,403
OW!

667
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:14,923
NOW, JACK, MARTY, DON'T YOU BE CALLING ME MR. TUTT.

668
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:17,579
I MIGHT BE PRESIDENT OF THE BANK,

669
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:19,946
BUT EVERYBODY STILL JUST CALLS ME HORACE JUNIOR.

670
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:24,650
IT'S TO DISTINGUISH ME FROM DADDY.

671
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:27,498
CINDY CALLED, TOLD ME TO HELP YOU BOYS OUT ANY WAY I CAN,

672
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:29,674
SO SHOOT.

673
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:33,417
WELL, FIRST, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE

674
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:35,113
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT MR. POND'S FINANCES.

675
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:44,168
WELL, I'LL CLEAR THAT UP FOR YOU, JACK.

676
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:47,912
MANY YEARS AGO, THREE FRIENDS FROM BEAVER RIDGE

677
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:51,751
WENT AWAY TO FIGHT IN KOREA.

678
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:54,375
THAT'S DADDY,

679
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:57,094
CHUCK DAVIES IN THE MIDDLE, THAT'S CINDY'S DADDY,

680
00:39:57,126 --> 00:40:00,006
LIONEL POND.

681
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:02,150
CAME BACK HEROES AND IN ONE PIECE,

682
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:04,934
AND DADDY, HE STARTED OUT HERE AT THE BANK AS A TELLER.

683
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:06,981
HE WORKED HIS WAY UP TO BE PRESIDENT.

684
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:09,861
NOW, POOR CINDY'S DADDY CHUCK,

685
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:12,421
WELL, CHUCK HAD A FONDNESS FOR THE BOTTLE.

686
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,501
HE NEVER DID AMOUNT TO VERY MUCH, AND SO

687
00:40:14,532 --> 00:40:18,212
DADDY AND LIONEL JUST KIND OF HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HIM TILL

688
00:40:18,244 --> 00:40:21,412
HE FINALLY GOT DRUNK ONE NIGHT AND DROVE HIMSELF OVER A CLIFF.

689
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:23,523
ANYWAY.

690
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:26,243
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE, HORACE.

691
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:29,058
HOW IS LIONEL'S COMPANY DOING? HE IN HOCK?

692
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:31,171
AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE IS TO US.

693
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:33,795
PUTTING ASIDE THE FACT THAT LIONEL'S BEEN

694
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:36,418
LIKE A SECOND DADDY TO ME, THE LAST THING

695
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,753
THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF BEAVER RIDGE WANTS TO DO

696
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:40,418
IS FORECLOSE ON THAT MORTGAGE.

697
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,113
NOBODY WOULD BE FOOL ENOUGH TO BUY IT.

698
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:43,969
CAN'T TURN IT INTO CONDOS

699
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:45,889
'CAUSE WHO WANTS TO LIVE IN A GIANT SANDBOX?

700
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:50,017
OH, IF IT ISN'T MY DARLING WIFE DARLENE.

701
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,648
DARLENE, COME HERE.

702
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:55,104
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO MEET JACK, MARTY.

703
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:56,639
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

704
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,351
HONEY, ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING?

705
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,919
HAH!

706
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:24,573
DARLENE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT EDGY LATELY,

707
00:41:24,605 --> 00:41:27,740
AND SHE SAW ON THAT OPRAH PROGRAM, WHERE THEY SAID

708
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:29,820
YOU OUGHT TO VENT OUT ALL YOUR ANGER.

709
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:31,451
HORSE SHIT.

710
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:35,419
EXCUSE ME.

711
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,211
YEAH, SHEILA. I TOLD YOU TO HOLD ALL MY CALL--

712
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:40,667
SURE.

713
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,106
MARTY.

714
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:43,994
IT'S FOR YOU.

715
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:50,490
HELLO?

716
00:41:52,602 --> 00:41:54,969
CINDY.

717
00:41:56,377 --> 00:41:58,169
YEAH.

718
00:41:58,201 --> 00:42:01,080
SO, AFTER THAT, I MOVED TO HOLLYWOOD.

719
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:04,216
OH, MARTY. YOU'VE LED SUCH AN INTERESTING LIFE.

720
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:06,520
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE THROUGH WITH ACTING?

721
00:42:06,552 --> 00:42:08,599
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

722
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:10,935
I MEAN, THIS PRIVATE EYE THING WAS JUST AN INTERN DEAL,

723
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:14,679
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M STARTING TO GET INTO IT.

724
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:17,751
I WISH I COULD FIND SOMETHING TO GET INTO.

725
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:20,150
WORKING AS A SECRETARY AT A GRAVEL PIT

726
00:42:20,182 --> 00:42:22,902
ISN'T EXACTLY MY IDEA OF CAREER FULFILLMENT.

727
00:42:24,118 --> 00:42:27,862
SO, QUIT. I MEAN, LEAVE, MOVE.

728
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:30,037
OH, THAT'S SO EASY TO SAY, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW

729
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,501
WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING RAISED IN A SMALL TOWN

730
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:35,572
AND NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ELSE.

731
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:39,412
BESIDES, MR. POND DID SO MUCH FOR MY DAD,

732
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:42,131
AND HE REALLY NEEDS ME.

733
00:42:42,164 --> 00:42:46,195
CINDY, THE WORLD IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO POTENTIALLY NEED YOU.

734
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,803
YOU THINK SO?

735
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:53,106
OH, YEAH.

736
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:55,826
MORE WINE?

737
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,386
YEAH. SURE.

738
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:05,458
I GUESS I MUST REALLY SEEM BORING TO YOU,

739
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,409
AFTER ALL THE GLAMOROUS WOMEN YOU'VE MET IN HOLLYWOOD.

740
00:43:12,113 --> 00:43:15,824
CINDY, I FIND YOU SO MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF BORING,

741
00:43:15,856 --> 00:43:18,896
THAT I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS.

742
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:22,927
I'M SERIOUS. YOU ARE THE FIRST WOMAN I'VE MET

743
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:26,894
SINCE I BROKE UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND THAT I REALLY LIKE.

744
00:43:30,222 --> 00:43:32,974
MORE WINE?

745
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:34,862
OH.

746
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:43,052
THAT WAS THE BEST MEATLOAF I HAVE EVER HAD.

747
00:43:43,085 --> 00:43:45,869
IT WAS GREAT.

748
00:43:45,901 --> 00:43:47,564
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.

749
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:00,971
NO. MARTY, I HARDLY KNOW YOU.

750
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:04,811
WHAT BETTER WAY TO GET TO KNOW ME?

751
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,650
I'M JUST AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL.

752
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:12,009
WELL, OLD-FASHIONED GIRLS DRIVE ME CRAZY.

753
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,017
OH, MARTY, PLEASE.

754
00:44:21,065 --> 00:44:22,537
PLEASE.

755
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:39,142
MARTY, YOU'RE SO AROUSED.

756
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:56,453
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO ASK.

757
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,340
THANKS.

758
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:04,291
SO, HOW'D IT GO WITH THE SHERIFF?

759
00:45:04,324 --> 00:45:08,355
HE STAYED IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME, SNORING AND BELCHING.

760
00:45:08,387 --> 00:45:11,395
NOT A SHITLOAD OF BUSINESS.

761
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:14,019
YOU KNOW, I'M PROUD OF YOU, JACK.

762
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,291
FOR WHAT?

763
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:18,531
FOR TAKING THIS CASE, YOU KNOW?

764
00:45:18,562 --> 00:45:20,994
YOU SAID YOU WERE DONE WITH THE DETECTIVE BUSINESS.

765
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:23,553
I TOOK THE CASE STRICTLY FOR THE PAY CHECK.

766
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:24,930
YEAH?

767
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:26,529
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

768
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:29,345
I THINK YOU TOOK IT BECAUSE YOU'RE INTRIGUED BY IT.

769
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:31,297
AND ALSO, YOU LIKE HAVING ME AS YOUR PARTNER.

770
00:45:32,544 --> 00:45:36,256
I THINK THE MACE IS AFFECTING YOUR BRAIN.

771
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:46,463
"IF IT AIN'T BIG, IT AIN'T BUD'S."

772
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:49,471
SO, JACK, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

773
00:45:49,503 --> 00:45:51,359
WELL...

774
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,574
I KNOW WHO KILLED DANNY HARKNESS.

775
00:45:56,606 --> 00:45:58,205
WHO?

776
00:45:58,238 --> 00:46:00,925
CAN'T TELL YOU THAT NOW. I'M BEING WATCHED.

777
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,229
WHO'S WATCHING YOU?

778
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,661
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT EITHER.

779
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:07,452
WHY NOT?

780
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:09,564
IT'S TOP, TOP SECRET.

781
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:11,581
WHEN CAN YOU TELL US?

782
00:46:11,612 --> 00:46:13,820
GIVE ME A RIDE HOME TO TRUSSBERG,

783
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,804
AND I'LL TELL YOU IN THE CAR.

784
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,491
I SEEN THE TWO-HEADED MULE AGAIN TODAY.

785
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:30,074
WE'RE HEADED OUT TO A TOWN FULL OF DEVIL WORSHIPERS

786
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:33,434
ON A TIP FROM A DAME WHO SEES TWO-HEADED MULES.

787
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:35,354
JACK, IN THE DETECTIVE BUSINESS,

788
00:46:35,385 --> 00:46:37,434
YOU CANNOT LEAVE ANY STONE UNTURNED.

789
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:39,129
WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED.

790
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:40,345
NO!

791
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:41,753
ARE YOU SURE?

792
00:46:41,785 --> 00:46:43,609
WE'RE SURE. BELIEVE ME.

793
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,104
THEY'D HAVE TAKEN A SHOT AT US BY NOW,

794
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,440
SO, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT DANNY HARKNESS?

795
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,320
I KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT DANNY HARKNESS.

796
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,848
HE WAS MY RELATIVE IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS.

797
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,184
HE WAS MY FIRST COUSIN, MY EX-BROTHER-IN-LAW

798
00:46:56,215 --> 00:46:58,103
AND MY NEPHEW ONCE REMOVED.

799
00:46:58,135 --> 00:47:00,311
SO, TELL US, WHO KILLED HIM?

800
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:02,231
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS INFORMATION.

801
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:04,598
THIS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN YOU KNOW.

802
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,614
WHO WAS IT?

803
00:47:06,646 --> 00:47:09,558
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WASHINGTON.

804
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:12,725
MY GOD! WHAT, THE GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED?

805
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:15,317
NO. GEORGE WASHINGTON.

806
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:18,901
THAT'S RIGHT, THE KID WHO COULDN'T TELL A LIE.

807
00:47:18,932 --> 00:47:21,428
SHOCKED? SO WAS I.

808
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,380
HE'S LIVING RIGHT UP ON THAT OLD MINE ON THE HILL,

809
00:47:23,412 --> 00:47:27,188
HIM AND ELVIS AND M.L. KING AND JFK,

810
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,524
AND JOHN LENNON AND HARRY TRUMAN.

811
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,043
THEY'VE GOT A CULT GOING ON UP THERE, THE BLUE OYSTER CULT.

812
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:34,579
I SEEN ELVIS SNEAKING INTO A STORE YESTERDAY.

813
00:47:34,611 --> 00:47:36,499
HE DIDN'T THINK I SEEN HIM, BUT I DID.

814
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:38,675
HE WAS BUYING TWO POUNDS OF JAWBREAKERS,

815
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:41,042
SOME FAT BACK AND A GALLON OF ROCKY ROAD.

816
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:45,042
LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS AROUND HERE.

817
00:47:45,074 --> 00:47:47,570
NOTHING'S LIKE IT SEEMS.

818
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:49,873
EVERYTHING'S CAMOUFLAGE.

819
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:00,848
WE DROVE ON TO TRUSSBERG,

820
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,080
WHERE THE ONLY GENE THE LOCALS DON'T SHARE IS HYGIENE.

821
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,735
OKAY. THERE WE ARE.

822
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:12,367
IF I GET ANY MORE LEADS--

823
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:13,679
DON'T CALL US.

824
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,407
YOU BOYS HUNGRY?

825
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,679
I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY.

826
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,973
ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU HAD THREE OF THOSE MUTANT DOUGHNUTS.

827
00:48:21,006 --> 00:48:23,278
JACK, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I NEED SOME PROTEIN.

828
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:28,301
BESIDES, THEY MAKE SOME GREAT BARBECUE IN THESE SMALL TOWNS.

829
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:33,772
COME ON, JACK. FREE FOOD.

830
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,498
MARTY, JACK--

831
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:53,098
THESE ARE MY COUSINS NED, CHRISTIE AND TINY.

832
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,010
HEY. SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO FOR A LIVING?

833
00:48:59,945 --> 00:49:02,505
I'M A STRIPPER. YOU WANT SOME MEAT?

834
00:49:04,264 --> 00:49:06,057
JACK, YOU WANT SOME MEAT?

835
00:49:06,088 --> 00:49:08,041
NO.

836
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:09,544
WHAT KIND OF MEAT IS IT?

837
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:12,232
IT'S GOOD MEAT.

838
00:49:12,264 --> 00:49:14,248
COME ON. I'LL FIX YOU A PLATE.

839
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:24,807
HEY.

840
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:27,174
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

841
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:29,478
ME?

842
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,174
I'M A SINGER.

843
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:34,310
NO SHIT!

844
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,973
WHAT KIND?

845
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:43,653
LOUNGE.

846
00:49:43,684 --> 00:49:45,700
LOUNGE!

847
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,012
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. WHY, LOUNGE!

848
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,180
STUMPY, HE'S A SINGER!

849
00:49:50,212 --> 00:49:51,428
DON'T CALL ME STUMPY.

850
00:49:51,459 --> 00:49:53,443
I LOVE LOUNGE!

851
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:55,939
NOW, THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN OR BEEF OR PORK,

852
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:58,467
OR THINGS PEOPLE USUALLY BARBECUE.

853
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:01,410
IT'S THE TOWN'S SPECIALTY.

854
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:17,216
I'M A SONGWRITER! I WROTE THIS,

855
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:19,521
AND I RECORDED IT WITH A BUDDY DOWN IN BAKERSFIELD.

856
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:23,168
HE USED TO HAVE A STUDIO, BUT HE'S DEAD NOW.

857
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,240
YEAH, SOMEBODY KILLED HIM FOR BEING SELFISH.

858
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:30,240
LOOK, THE SONG'S CALLED "LAST TRAIN TO TRUSSBERG."

859
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,967
YOU THINK YOU COULD HELP ME GET IT PUBLISHED?

860
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:34,015
I MEAN, HEY, LOOK, YOU CAN SING IT.

861
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:35,743
HELL, YOU CAN EVEN RECORD IT!

862
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:38,783
HEY, HEY, HEY, I'VE GOT WORDS. LISTEN.

870
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:56,540
YOU KNOW, GIVE IT A COWBOY FEEL. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

871
00:50:56,572 --> 00:50:59,803
WELL, I DON'T SING OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS. I'M A LONER.

00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:02,364
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

873

IS THERE A PLACE AROUND HERE A GUY CAN TAKE A PEE IN?

YOU THINK YOU'RE ONE BIG SHOT SINGER, DON'T YOU?

00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:16,826
THAT'S TWO-LANE REDWOOD HIGHWAY. I WROTE THAT, HUH?

878
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:20,889
TWO-LANE REDWOOD HIGHWAY!

879
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,769
YOU'RE SELFISH, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

880
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:26,841
LOOK, I'M GOING TO SING THE DAMN SONG,

881
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:31,960
BUT ONLY ON ONE CONDITION THAT YOU SIGN OVER THE RIGHTS.

882
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:35,768
I'M GOING TO WRITE MY ADDRESS DOWN ON A PIECE OF--

883
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,432
WELL, I'LL WRITE IT DOWN ON YOUR HAND.

884
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:39,223
DO IT.

885
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:41,528
AND THEN YOU SEND ME THE PAPERS.

886
00:51:51,702 --> 00:51:54,517
UH, MARTY, TIME TO GO.

887
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,926
COME ON. THANK YOU.

888
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:57,557
SEE YOU LATER.

889
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,902
JACK, I THINK THESE PEOPLE--

890
00:51:58,933 --> 00:52:00,053
SHUT UP AND KEEP MOVING.

891
00:52:00,085 --> 00:52:01,013
I THINK THEY'RE CANNIBALS.

892
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:03,605
SHUT UP AND KEEP MOVING.

893
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:05,588
COME ON. STICK A LEG, WHILE YOU STILL HAVE ONE.

894
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:06,964
JACK--

895
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:09,396
HURRY IT UP!

896
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:11,636
START THE CAR AND GET OUT OF HERE.

897
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:13,171
JACK, THAT MEAT HAD A SHOE ON IT.

898
00:52:13,204 --> 00:52:14,675
I SAID START THE CAR!

899
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:17,300
HEY, BIG SHOT SINGER!

900
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:18,707
OH, MY GOD. GET DOWN!

901
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:19,987
WATCH OUT!

902
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:22,035
WHAT THE HELL?

903
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:23,826
DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE NOW?

904
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:26,002
I'M GOING!

905
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:28,114
GO!

906
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:30,162
STOP THE CAR!

907
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:35,377
COME ON!

908
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:53,935
COME ON, HURRY UP!

909
00:52:56,847 --> 00:52:59,823
DAMN IT, WE'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY. THE HIGHWAY IS BACK THERE!

910
00:52:59,854 --> 00:53:02,094
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THESE NUT CASES.

911
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:04,302
COME ON!

912
00:53:07,246 --> 00:53:08,845
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS CAR?

913
00:53:08,878 --> 00:53:10,317
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE IT?

914
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:11,821
BASTARDS!

915
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:19,884
OH...

916
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:22,700
HOLD ON, JACK!

917
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:24,651
WATCH OUT!

918
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,635
THAT TIME, DID YOU SEE WHAT IT DID?

919
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,363
SELFISH.

920
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:39,018
OUCH! SHIT!

921
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,650
WOO!

922
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:42,537
ALL RIGHT, JACK!

923
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,913
I THINK WE LOST THEM.

924
00:53:43,945 --> 00:53:44,905
YEAH.

925
00:53:44,937 --> 00:53:47,497
WOO!

926
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:53,000
HOLY SHIT!

927
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:54,920
THEY'VE GOT ARTILLERY!

928
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:57,352
HILLBILLIES WITH HOWITZERS!

929
00:53:57,383 --> 00:53:59,048
AND HELICOPTERS!

930
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:06,215
YOU ARE ON A UNITED STATES NAVAL INSTALLATION.

931
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,751
NAVAL INSTALLATION?

932
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:09,574
YOU ARE IN A RESTRICTED AREA.

933
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:11,271
OH, FUCK!

934
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:13,574
SHIT!

935
00:54:17,126 --> 00:54:21,253
15 YEARS OF WAX JOBS, OIL CHANGES,

936
00:54:21,285 --> 00:54:23,877
LITTLE SCENTED PINE TREES.

937
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,444
JACK! ARE YOU OKAY?

938
00:54:33,476 --> 00:54:34,756
STOP! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

939
00:54:34,788 --> 00:54:36,516
FREEZE! DON'T MOVE!

940
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:40,419
ARE WE IN TROUBLE?

941
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:41,667
WHAT?

942
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:44,387
ARE WE IN TROUBLE?

943
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:46,883
DO NOT MOVE, AND YOU WILL NOT BE HURT.

944
00:54:50,178 --> 00:54:53,794
FROM THE HALLS OF MONTEZUMA TO THE SHORES OF TRIPOLI,

945
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:58,689
I WANTED TO PUT MY TRIPLE-E SHOE UP MARTY'S ASS.

946
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:02,464
MY CHEVELLE WAS FLATTER THAN AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHEERLEADER.

947
00:55:02,497 --> 00:55:05,920
WELL, AT LEAST I STILL HAVE MY VAN, THE GOOD OLD BOY.

948
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:10,464
THANKS A LOT.

949
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:18,655
BOY, THAT'S SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?

950
00:55:18,687 --> 00:55:21,535
A WEAPONS TESTING PLACE, RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

951
00:55:21,566 --> 00:55:24,190
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THOSE GUYS WERE PRETTY COOL, DIDN'T YOU?

952
00:55:24,223 --> 00:55:26,750
OH, YEAH, SURE DID.

953
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:29,437
TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THAT 6½-HOUR INTERROGATION,

954
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,189
I STARTED TO THINK OF THEM AS OLD FRIENDS.

955
00:55:36,189 --> 00:55:37,980
BOY, THAT SERGEANT SURE HAD COLD HANDS

956
00:55:38,013 --> 00:55:39,900
DURING THAT CAVITY SEARCH, DIDN'T SHE?

957
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:42,396
WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT A SHE.

958
00:55:44,156 --> 00:55:45,755
SO, WHO ARE OUR SUSPECTS?

959
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:47,356
THE WAY I SEE IT, THERE'S THREE: THE SHERIFF--

960
00:55:47,388 --> 00:55:48,476
DEFINITELY.

961
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:49,659
THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANK--

962
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:51,259
WHAT, HORACE JUNIOR?

963
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:53,179
WELL, IF THE GRAVEL PIT GOES UNDER, WHO GETS IT? THE BANK.

964
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:55,962
BUT HORACE JUNIOR SAID THAT THING WAS WORTHLESS TO THEM.

965
00:55:55,995 --> 00:55:58,842
WELL, MAYBE HE'S THE BAD GUY, AND HE'S NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH.

966
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,890
MURDERERS DO THAT KIND OF THING, YOU KNOW?

967
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,242
OKAY, WELL, WHO'S THE THIRD?

968
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:07,002
YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND.

969
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:09,561
CINDY? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

970
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:10,873
WELL, COME ON. YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME

971
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:12,505
THAT YOU BUY HER SUSIE CREAM CHEESE ACT?

972
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,233
NOBODY COULD BE THAT WHOLESOME.

973
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:15,641
JACK, SHE'S THE ONE WHO TOLD POND ABOUT US.

974
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,464
NO, IT WAS OWENS.

975
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:20,312
LOOK, I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT ANY OF THE WHYS OF THIS THING,

976
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:22,935
BUT WHEN I DO, MAYBE I'LL FIGURE OUT THE WHOS.

977
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:24,952
AND ABOUT YOUR CAR, JACK, I'M SORRY.

978
00:56:24,983 --> 00:56:27,735
IT WAS MY CHEVELLE THAT WENT OVER THAT CLIFF.

979
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:30,647
TONIGHT, DAMN THE ULCERS AND FULL SPEED AHEAD.

980
00:56:31,894 --> 00:56:33,910
DO YOU WANT ANOTHER SNORT?

981
00:56:33,943 --> 00:56:36,374
AH, SURE.

982
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:38,262
I MEAN, SURE.

983
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:40,694
YOU KNOW, I LOVED THAT CAR.

984
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:44,085
YEAH, IT HAD GREAT LINES, JACK.

985
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:45,941
YEAH, I WAS THE SMOOTHEST. PECKER.

986
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:54,708
YOU KNOW, JACK--

987
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,460
SOMETHING STILL KIND OF CONFUSES ME.

988
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:01,172
NOW, WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED BY THAT?

989
00:57:01,203 --> 00:57:03,059
DIANE--

990
00:57:03,091 --> 00:57:06,931
YOU KNOW, THE WOMAN THAT YOU HAD ME COME UP HERE TO SPY ON.

991
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:10,322
I MEAN, WHAT GIVES WITH HER?

992
00:57:12,146 --> 00:57:14,866
MARTY, I SET YOU UP, AND I'M SORRY.

993
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,914
JACK, WHAT-- YOU SET ME UP FOR--

994
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:18,865
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

995
00:57:18,898 --> 00:57:21,361
I'M TALKING ABOUT DIANE.

996
00:57:21,393 --> 00:57:23,633
YOU DON'T THINK I'D GIVE YOU A REAL CASE TO TRAIN YOU?

997
00:57:23,664 --> 00:57:26,256
I'M NOT THAT FUCKING CRAZY.

998
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,145
SHE'S MY PARTNER'S WIFE.

999
00:57:31,439 --> 00:57:33,456
SHE CAME TO MY OFFICE ONE NIGHT.

1000
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:35,312
WE SORT OF--

1001
00:57:35,343 --> 00:57:38,095
WE FELL INTO EACH OTHER'S ARMS.

1002
00:57:38,127 --> 00:57:40,015
WE STARTED TO GET IT ON, AND WE KNEW RIGHT AWAY,

1003
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:41,711
BOTH OF US, THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO END THERE.

1004
00:57:44,463 --> 00:57:47,470
BUT MORRIS FOUND OUT.

1005
00:57:47,503 --> 00:57:50,670
AND HE JUST DIED OF A BROKEN HEART.

1006
00:57:50,702 --> 00:57:52,973
HE COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

1007
00:57:53,006 --> 00:57:56,013
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE THEN,

1008
00:57:56,045 --> 00:57:59,213
BUT I--

1009
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:01,804
I THINK ABOUT HER ALL THE TIME.

1010
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:05,644
WOW.

1011
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:07,948
HUH.

1012
00:58:10,924 --> 00:58:13,516
CINDY, I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN THE WOODS SINCE I WAS A KID.

1013
00:58:13,547 --> 00:58:15,467
NOW, WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

1014
00:58:15,499 --> 00:58:17,963
I HAVE A SPECIAL SPOT.

1015
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:21,962
YEAH, I'LL BET YOU DO.

1016
00:58:37,224 --> 00:58:38,665
I DON'T GET IT.

1017
00:58:38,696 --> 00:58:40,712
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? GET WHAT?

1018
00:58:40,744 --> 00:58:44,360
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD KILL FOR A DUMP LIKE THIS.

1019
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:45,927
I DO.

1020
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:48,231
I KNOW.

1021
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:51,911
THIS HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR COUSINS, DOES IT?

1022
00:58:51,943 --> 00:58:53,702
BECAUSE OF THIS.

1023
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,485
SO, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT HERE?

1024
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:10,405
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1025
00:59:10,437 --> 00:59:12,005
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

1026
00:59:12,036 --> 00:59:13,668
IT'S RIGHT OFF THE HIGHWAY,

1027
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,172
BUT IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

1028
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:18,084
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

1029
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:21,891
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

1030
00:59:21,924 --> 00:59:23,619
IT'S SO ROMANTIC.

1031
00:59:30,403 --> 00:59:32,194
SHIT!

1032
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:34,498
GOD!

1033
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,674
IT'S JUST A LITTLE INSECT.

1034
00:59:38,626 --> 00:59:40,673
PROBABLY MORE AFRAID OF YOU THAN YOU ARE OF IT.

1035
00:59:44,993 --> 00:59:47,296
I DON'T THINK SO.

1036
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:50,272
YOU KNOW, MARTY, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT

1037
00:59:50,304 --> 00:59:53,248
YOU AND JACK ARE SUSPICIOUS OF HORACE JUNIOR.

1038
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,031
HE'S ONE OF THE SWEETEST MEN I KNOW.

1039
00:59:56,064 --> 00:59:58,336
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S ALL JUST AN ACT.

1040
01:00:00,095 --> 01:00:02,719
NOT EVERYBODY'S FROM HOLLYWOOD, MARTY.

1041
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,574
SOME PEOPLE ARE EXACTLY WHAT THEY SEEM.

1042
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,596
JESUS!

1043
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:36,475
CINDY! STAY BACK!

1044
01:00:41,435 --> 01:00:43,322
OH, MY GOD.

1045
01:00:43,355 --> 01:00:44,986
MARTY, ARE YOU OKAY?

1046
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:46,874
YEAH.

1047
01:00:49,882 --> 01:00:51,609
SO, THAT'S IT?

1048
01:00:51,642 --> 01:00:53,657
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A JOB?

1049
01:00:53,689 --> 01:00:57,368
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

1050
01:00:57,401 --> 01:00:59,609
THIS ISN'T OUR CASE. THIS IS SHERIFF OWENS'.

1051
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,688
I MEAN, LET HIM GET HIS BALLS BLOWN OFF.

1052
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,248
WELL, AREN'T YOU INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING ON UP HERE?

1053
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,864
I MEAN, WHERE'S THE OLD FIRE IN THE BELLY,

1054
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:11,704
OR DOESN'T ANYTHING HAVE ANY VALUE TO YOU ANYMORE?

1055
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:13,271
YOU KNOW, THE HELL WITH YOU, JACK. I MEAN,

1056
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:16,535
YEAH, I MAY BE A SCREW UP, BUT YOU'RE NO PRIZE YOURSELF.

1057
01:01:16,566 --> 01:01:18,871
I MEAN, BROKEN DOWN DETECTIVE,

1058
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:20,854
AND YOU'RE SPYING ON A WOMAN YOU'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED TO.

1059
01:01:26,454 --> 01:01:28,118
GET OUT OF HERE.

1060
01:01:33,013 --> 01:01:34,677
JACK...

1061
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,436
SORRY, JACK.

1062
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,835
MARTY STRUCK A NERVE,

1063
01:01:46,868 --> 01:01:49,459
AND I HATED HIM FOR IT.

1064
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:54,387
HE WAS RIGHT. I HAD NO BUSINESS SPYING ON DIANE,

1065
01:01:54,418 --> 01:01:56,786
BUT MAYBE I COULD CATCH A KILLER.

1066
01:01:59,122 --> 01:02:02,066
THAT WOULD BE A NICE CAPPER TO MY CRAPPY CAREER.

1067
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:06,993
BALL AND WRECKERS, PLEASE.

1068
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:09,393
UH, MIKE MINER IN THE SAYERS OFFICE.

1069
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:14,320
MIKE? JACK POTTER HERE.

1070
01:02:14,353 --> 01:02:17,903
I'M FINE. UH, I'M UP IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS, BUDDY.

1071
01:02:17,936 --> 01:02:19,823
I'D LIKE YOU TO DO A FAVOR FOR ME.

1072
01:02:34,765 --> 01:02:37,197
MARTY!

1073
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,213
JACK TOLD ME YOU'D LEFT.

1074
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:41,261
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

1075
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:42,413
I HAD TO SEE YOU.

1076
01:02:42,445 --> 01:02:44,301
COME IN.

1077
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:19,880
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED HOW LONG IT'S BEEN

1078
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:21,897
SINCE I'VE BEEN WITH A GUY.

1079
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:25,288
I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY SPECIAL, MARTY.

1080
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,296
CINDY, I LEFT. I DESERTED YOU.

1081
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:29,991
BUT YOU CAME BACK.

1082
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:35,623
YEAH. YOU KNOW, I GUESS I KIND OF SURPRISED MYSELF.

1083
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:43,110
CINDY, I SAID SOME REAL TERRIBLE THINGS TO JACK.

1084
01:03:43,142 --> 01:03:46,917
I THINK HE MUST REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

1085
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:50,086
DID HE MENTION WHY HE WAS GOING TO PORTLAND?

1086
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,973
NO. HE JUST SAID IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CASE

1087
01:03:52,006 --> 01:03:53,573
AND THAT HE'D BE BACK LATE TONIGHT.

1088
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:04,580
CINDY, CAN I BORROW YOUR JEEP?

1089
01:04:21,794 --> 01:04:23,874
WHOEVER THE HELL YOU ARE,

1090
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:26,497
GET YOUR GODDAMN HANDS UP AND COME ON OUT HERE.

1091
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:31,776
GODDAMN IT. YOU AGAIN?

1092
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:35,168
THAT'S RIGHT, SHERIFF, ME...

1093
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:36,513
AND AS WE SPEAK,

1094
01:04:36,544 --> 01:04:39,168
MY PARTNER JACK POTTER'S ON HIS WAY TO GET THE FBI

1095
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:41,279
TO ARREST YOU FOR THE MURDER OF DANNY HARKNESS.

1096
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:43,072
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MURDERED DANNY HARKNESS?

1097
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:47,295
WHAT ARE YOU DIGGING THERE, SHERIFF, A GRAVE?

1098
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:49,951
THAT AIN'T EXACTLY A BAD IDEA.

1099
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,285
I WAS DIGGING SOMETHING UP, NOT BURYING IT.

1100
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,525
COME HERE.

1101
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:19,515
NOW, THIS HERE'S A PETER RING.

1102
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:22,683
YOU PUT THAT SUCKER ON, YOU CAN GO ALL NIGHT LONG.

1103
01:05:25,115 --> 01:05:28,251
WHAT I GOT OVER HERE IS ONE OF THEM VIBRATING DILDOS.

1104
01:05:28,282 --> 01:05:31,514
YOU CAN JUST PLUG IT RIGHT INTO A CIGARETTE LIGHTER.

1105
01:05:31,546 --> 01:05:33,242
IT MAKES IT EASY FOR LOVING ON THE RUN,

1106
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:35,289
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

1107
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:38,009
YOU GOT YOUR DOUBLE-HEADED DILDO. MAKES FOR SOME VARIETY.

1108
01:05:39,737 --> 01:05:42,552
NOW THIS LITTLE BUDDY OVER HERE, THIS IS THE BUTT PLUG.

1109
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:44,761
YOU GOT NO IDEA WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS LITTLE SUCKER.

1110
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:46,808
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE, SHERIFF.

1111
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:48,696
SEX PARAPHERNALIA?

1112
01:05:50,264 --> 01:05:54,551
WHAT, ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE MEETING A WOMAN OUT HERE?

1113
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,175
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

1114
01:05:57,207 --> 01:06:00,342
IS I'M A DIRTY, LYING, CHEATING, ADULTEROUS SON OF A BITCH

1115
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:04,119
WITH A BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND TWO KIDS,

1116
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,382
AND A BOX OF SEX TOYS BURIED OUT HERE IN THE GROUND.

1117
01:06:09,302 --> 01:06:10,709
I'M A DIRTY BIRDIE BOY.

1118
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:14,549
WAS THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING HERE THE OTHER NIGHT,

1119
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:16,117
WHEN EVERYTHING BLEW UP?

1120
01:06:16,149 --> 01:06:19,061
YEAH, AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN SHOW UP THAT NIGHT.

1121
01:06:19,092 --> 01:06:21,333
ALMOST GOT KILLED.

1122
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:23,028
HELL, SHE'S EVEN LATE TONIGHT.

1123
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:24,724
NOW, I'VE GOT TWO WOMEN DRIVING ME CRAZY, INSTEAD OF ONE.

1124
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,315
IT'S JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME, RIGHT?

1125
01:06:31,348 --> 01:06:34,386
OH, YEAH. NO, DEFINITELY. YEAH.

1126
01:06:35,507 --> 01:06:37,395
GO FOR IT.

1127
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,058
A COUPLE OF PECKERS WITH A BOX OF DILDOS.

1128
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:45,394
MARTY'S HUNCH HAD CRAPPED OUT

1129
01:06:45,426 --> 01:06:47,922
WORSE THAN A TOURIST IN TIJUANA,

1130
01:06:47,953 --> 01:06:51,665
BUT THERE WAS ONE MORE SEX TOY WAITING FOR MARTY...

1131
01:06:51,697 --> 01:06:53,488
A COLD COCK.

1132
01:07:08,175 --> 01:07:10,127
HORACE JUNIOR?

1133
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,111
WELL, HI THERE, MARTY.

1134
01:07:15,662 --> 01:07:17,774
WHERE AM I?

1135
01:07:17,806 --> 01:07:20,621
YOU'RE ON A CONVEYOR BELT

1136
01:07:20,654 --> 01:07:22,893
AT THE POND GRAVEL AND ASPHALT COMPANY'S ROCK CRUSHING MACHINE.

1137
01:07:22,926 --> 01:07:25,133
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE SNOOPING AROUND WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T BE

1138
01:07:25,165 --> 01:07:28,365
AND ACCIDENTALLY GET CRUSHED TO DEATH.

1139
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:32,173
CURIOSITY KILLED THE HOTSHOT BIG CITY PRIVATE EYE.

1140
01:07:32,204 --> 01:07:34,860
YOU KILLED DANNY HARKNESS? WHY?

1141
01:07:34,892 --> 01:07:37,068
GREED.

1142
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,563
PURE GREED MADE ME DO IT.

1143
01:07:39,596 --> 01:07:41,995
THE LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.

1144
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:44,299
A LOT OF FUN, TOO.

1145
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:47,819
MONEY? HORACE, THIS IS A WORTHLESS HOLE IN THE GROUND.

1146
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:54,986
SHIT.

1147
01:07:55,017 --> 01:07:56,970
YEAH.

1148
01:07:57,001 --> 01:07:58,665
ALL RIGHT.

1149
01:07:58,698 --> 01:08:00,649
NOW, THIS MUST BE THE THROTTLE.

1150
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:02,057
LET'S SEE. I CAN SPEED IT UP.

1151
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:03,497
HORACE!

1152
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:04,872
OR I CAN SLOW IT DOWN.

1153
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:06,505
HORACE!

1154
01:08:06,536 --> 01:08:07,912
OH, YEAH!

1155
01:08:07,945 --> 01:08:09,320
GET ME OUT OF HERE, HORACE.

1156
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:10,568
FASTER...

1157
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,264
SLOWER.

1158
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:14,023
FASTER, SLOWER.

1159
01:08:16,455 --> 01:08:18,375
GOD DAMN IT!

1160
01:08:18,407 --> 01:08:20,359
I LOVE THIS.

1161
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:22,375
REVERSE...

1162
01:08:23,847 --> 01:08:24,903
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

1163
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,751
OH, MAN, THIS IS JUST LIKE WHEN I'M AT A SALAD PLACE.

1164
01:08:27,782 --> 01:08:29,862
WELL, WHERE'S THE HERO SUPPOSED TO SAVE ME?

1165
01:08:29,894 --> 01:08:31,718
UH-UH.

1166
01:08:31,749 --> 01:08:32,934
HUH?

1167
01:08:32,965 --> 01:08:35,270
NOT IN MY MOVIE.

1168
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:36,773
HORACE, DON'T DO IT. HELP ME!

1169
01:08:36,805 --> 01:08:38,277
HORACE JUNIOR, STOP THAT BELT

1170
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:39,973
AND GET YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!

1171
01:08:40,005 --> 01:08:41,348
HELP!

1172
01:08:41,381 --> 01:08:42,468
JACK, HURRY UP!

1173
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:43,940
I SAID STOP THAT BELT!

1174
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:45,125
HORACE!

1175
01:08:47,684 --> 01:08:48,804
JACK!

1176
01:08:48,836 --> 01:08:50,052
JACK!

1177
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:56,515
JACK! COME ON!

1178
01:08:58,691 --> 01:09:00,450
JACK!

1179
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:02,946
HORACE, DROP THE GUN!

1180
01:09:05,922 --> 01:09:07,777
JACK! HELP!

1181
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,089
JACK!

1182
01:09:09,122 --> 01:09:10,113
JACK, HURRY UP!

1183
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:13,537
HELP ME!

1184
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:14,497
DAMN.

1185
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:16,000
HURRY UP!

1186
01:09:17,537 --> 01:09:19,585
SHIT. FASTER!

1187
01:09:23,232 --> 01:09:24,768
JACK, HELP!

1188
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:28,416
JACK!

1189
01:09:41,726 --> 01:09:42,974
MARTY.

1190
01:09:43,006 --> 01:09:44,670
JACK?

1191
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:50,685
WANT A MINT?

1192
01:09:50,717 --> 01:09:54,908
NO. I WANT YOU TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

1193
01:09:56,157 --> 01:09:59,612
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITHOUT HORACE JUNIOR?

1194
01:09:59,644 --> 01:10:02,204
NOW, DARLENE, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS OLD HORACE JUNIOR

1195
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:04,700
WASN'T A VERY NICE FELLA.

1196
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:08,955
I KNOW THAT, ALTON, BUT HE HAD SO MUCH MONEY.

1197
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:11,386
WELL, HE MUST HAVE LEFT YOU SOMETHING.

1198
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:14,586
NO, NOT A SINGLE DIME.

1199
01:10:14,618 --> 01:10:17,882
ALTON, I JUST TALKED TO MY LAWYER.

1200
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:22,745
HORACE JUNIOR SPENT IT ALL ON WOMEN IN LAS VEGAS.

1201
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:25,657
OH, NOW, COME ON. WELL, AT LEAST YOU'VE STILL GOT

1202
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,729
YOUR JOB BACK AT THE NAVAL BASE, AND I THINK YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1203
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,392
YEAH.

1204
01:10:30,424 --> 01:10:31,929
COULD YOU DO ME A LITTLE FAVOR NOW?

1205
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,848
I NEED YOU TO WAIT IN THE OTHER ROOM.

1206
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:34,904
WE'VE STILL GOT SOME MORE QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU.

1207
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:37,176
OKAY.

1208
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,680
AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE, OLD TOMMY WILL TAKE YOU HOME DIRECTLY, ALL RIGHT?

1209
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:42,551
ALL RIGHT. THANKS, ALTON. I'LL BE OKAY.

1210
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,111
SHE WON'T BE LONELY LONG.

1211
01:10:45,143 --> 01:10:48,758
OLD DARLENE LIKE SAILORS.

1212
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:52,118
JESUS, ISN'T ANYBODY IN THIS TOWN FAITHFUL?

1213
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:58,454
YEAH, SOME OF US STILL ARE.

1214
01:10:58,485 --> 01:11:01,173
SO, WHAT IS THIS RUTILE STUFF ANYWAY?

1215
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:04,116
IT'S WHAT THEY MAKE TITANIUM OUT OF.

1216
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:07,412
IT'S A LIGHTWEIGHT, HIGHLY HEAT-RESISTANT METAL.

1217
01:11:07,445 --> 01:11:09,812
THEY USE IT IN THE SPACE SHUTTLE, FOR ONE THING.

1218
01:11:09,844 --> 01:11:11,732
AND IT'S WORTH SOMETHING?

1219
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:13,267
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. THAT OLD BUZZARD OUT THERE

1220
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,795
AT THE GRAVEL PIT IS A VERY RICH MAN.

1221
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,763
HEY, JACK. YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE?

1222
01:11:19,795 --> 01:11:21,650
NO WAY.

1223
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:27,346
MARTY!

1224
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:30,993
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1225
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:32,817
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HORACE TRIED TO DO TO YOU.

1226
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,641
WHERE'S LIONEL?

1227
01:11:34,674 --> 01:11:36,081
I THINK ALL THE EXCITEMENT'S BEEN A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR HIM,

1228
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:38,064
SO HE ASKED NOT TO SEE YOU TODAY,

1229
01:11:38,097 --> 01:11:40,048
BUT HE WANTED ME TO GIVE YOU THIS MONEY.

1230
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:42,449
I'LL TAKE THAT.

1231
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,464
MR. POND WAS SO HAPPY WITH THE JOB YOU DID,

1232
01:11:44,496 --> 01:11:46,896
HE'S GIVING YOU A BONUS, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE

1233
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:50,607
THAT MR. POND IS RICH. IT'S HIS LIFELONG DREAM...

1234
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,527
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

1235
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:07,406
I'LL GO BACK TO THE VAN, SLIP INTO MY BAGGY TROUSERS.

1236
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,268
WITH AN ENVELOPE FULL OF CASH,

1237
01:12:16,301 --> 01:12:19,308
IT WAS TIME TO DASH BACK TO L.A. AND CALL THOSE BROKERS.

1238
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,836
I HAD BAIT AND TACKLE ON MY MIND,

1239
01:12:21,867 --> 01:12:25,132
BUT MY GUT SAID MARTY'S THE ONE WHO WAS HOOKED.

1240
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:29,675
SO, YOU'RE IN LOVE?

1241
01:12:29,707 --> 01:12:32,203
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

1242
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,226
THANKS A LOT FOR SAVING MY BUTT LAST NIGHT.

1243
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:40,074
YOU'RE LUCKY CINDY CALLED ME.

1244
01:12:42,185 --> 01:12:43,497
HOLD IT, JACK.

1245
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,065
I DIDN'T TELL CINDY I WAS GOING TO THE GRAVEL PIT.

1246
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:50,216
ALL I TOLD HER WAS THAT I WAS GOING TO TAIL SHERIFF OWENS.

1247
01:12:50,249 --> 01:12:53,737
SHE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE GOING TO THE GRAVEL PIT.

1248
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:56,360
UNLESS...

1249
01:12:56,392 --> 01:12:58,312
UNLESS WHAT?

1250
01:12:58,343 --> 01:13:00,296
SHUT UP.

1251
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:02,087
JACK, WHAT?

1252
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,839
SHUT UP. I'M THINKING.

1253
01:13:13,926 --> 01:13:16,646
JACK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1254
01:13:18,821 --> 01:13:20,966
YOU GOT THAT REPORT ON MR. DENNIS IN PISS AND CHOW?

1255
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:22,629
IT'S BY THE PHONE.

1256
01:13:22,661 --> 01:13:24,325
GODDAMN MORNING'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

1257
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:27,269
SHIT.

1258
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,524
YOU TWO.

1259
01:13:31,556 --> 01:13:33,380
DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU SO SOON.

1260
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:35,364
UH, SHERIFF, I GOT ONE MORE QUESTION TO ASK YOU.

1261
01:13:35,396 --> 01:13:38,883
THAT WOMAN YOU'VE BEEN MEETING OUT AT THE GRAVEL PIT?

1262
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,547
WHAT ABOUT HER?

1263
01:13:40,579 --> 01:13:43,874
IS HER NAME CINDY DAVIES?

1264
01:13:43,907 --> 01:13:45,346
JACK, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING--

1265
01:13:45,378 --> 01:13:47,235
SHUT UP, MARTY.

1266
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:52,034
YOU DON'T TELL ME, SHERIFF,

1267
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:53,858
I MIGHT HAVE TO ASK YOUR WIFE A FEW QUESTIONS.

1268
01:13:55,362 --> 01:13:57,761
YOU SONS OF BITCHES.

1269
01:13:57,793 --> 01:14:00,545
YES.

1270
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:02,145
NOW GET OUT.

1271
01:14:05,633 --> 01:14:08,384
COME ON, MARTY.

1272
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:11,520
SORRY, KID.

1273
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:13,631
COME ON, JACK. IF CINDY'S IN CAHOOTS WITH HORACE JUNIOR,

1274
01:14:13,664 --> 01:14:16,159
SHE TELLS HIM WE'RE I'LL BE AND LEAVES A MESSAGE FOR YOU

1275
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,567
TO DO WHAT, COME OUT AND SAVE ME?

1276
01:14:17,599 --> 01:14:18,974
I MEAN, THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE STUPID.

1277
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,087
I WAS BEING SET UP, TOO.

1278
01:14:21,118 --> 01:14:23,742
HORACE JUNIOR WAS SUPPOSED TO KILL THE BOTH OF US.

1279
01:14:23,774 --> 01:14:26,653
BUT JACK, THERE'S ONE THING YOU'RE FORGETTING ABOUT.

1280
01:14:26,686 --> 01:14:27,934
WHAT?

1281
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:30,590
WHY WOULD CINDY TRY TO ASSASSINATE HERSELF

1282
01:14:30,622 --> 01:14:32,413
WITH A HAND GRENADE?

1283
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:37,116
NOW, WHO DRANK MY DAMN PEPSI?

1284
01:14:37,149 --> 01:14:39,677
DIDN'T YOUR MOM EVER TEACH YOU TO KNOCK?

1285
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,461
LOVE OF PETE. WHEN ARE THE TWO OF YOU GONNA LEAVE MY TOWN?

1286
01:14:42,492 --> 01:14:44,124
SHERIFF, GRAB A SEAT.

1287
01:14:44,156 --> 01:14:45,820
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU.

1288
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:48,699
JACK?

1289
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:51,067
UH, YES, SHERIFF.

1290
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,459
TWO DAYS AGO, MARTY AND CINDY DAVIES WERE HAVING A PICNIC,

1291
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,370
AND SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL THE TWO OF THEM.

1292
01:14:57,403 --> 01:15:00,762
NOW, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CINDY DAVIES IS THAT SHE WAS BONING YOU.

1293
01:15:00,794 --> 01:15:02,554
WAIT A SECOND. YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY ANYTHING.

1294
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:04,474
SHERIFF.

1295
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:06,425
SHE WAS ALSO HUMPING MARTY.

1296
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:09,881
HOLD ON, JACK. IT WAS A LITTLE MORE THAN JUST HUMPING.

1297
01:15:09,913 --> 01:15:13,721
AND PRESUMABLY SHE WAS DOING THE NASTY WITH HORACE JUNIOR.

1298
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,952
MISS DARLENE, YOU UNDERSTAND YOU COULD ALSO

1299
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:23,255
HAVE KILLED MY PARTNER WITH THAT GRENADE?

1300
01:15:23,287 --> 01:15:25,335
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

1301
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:27,063
SIR, YOU'D BETTER APOLOGIZE RIGHT AWAY.

1302
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:34,039
LOOK AT HER. NOW, WHY WHERE WOULD THIS ANGEL FIND A GRENADE?

1303
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,958
OH, WELL, HOW ABOUT FROM ONE OF THE SAILORS SHE WAS SCREWING

1304
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,654
AT THE NAVAL WEAPONS TESTING CENTER?

1305
01:15:37,685 --> 01:15:40,598
RIGHT, MARTY. YOU TELL 'EM.

1306
01:15:40,629 --> 01:15:42,678
DARLENE.

1307
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:44,629
YOU SAID I WAS YOUR ONE AND ONLY.

1308
01:15:44,661 --> 01:15:46,293
I--

1309
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:49,397
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT TO GO OFF.

1310
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:52,148
SHERIFF, GRAB YOUR GUN. YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

1311
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:54,772
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

1312
01:15:59,891 --> 01:16:01,780
JACK, GIVE ME A GUN.

1313
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:03,763
WHAT?

1314
01:16:03,795 --> 01:16:06,355
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

1315
01:16:06,386 --> 01:16:07,731
I'M SURE THE SHERIFF WON'T MIND, RIGHT?

1316
01:16:07,762 --> 01:16:09,299
HELL, THAT BITCH IS CRAZY. YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA GUN,

1317
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:10,802
GIVE IT TO HIM. HE'S GOING TO NEED IT.

1318
01:16:14,962 --> 01:16:16,818
BE CAREFUL.

1319
01:16:21,297 --> 01:16:23,601
IT ALL MADE SENSE.

1320
01:16:23,633 --> 01:16:26,000
SUSIE CREAM CHEESE WAS THE BIG CHEESE.

1321
01:16:26,032 --> 01:16:30,736
CINDY DAVIES, THE KILLER BEAVER OF BEAVER RIDGE.

1322
01:16:30,768 --> 01:16:33,200
TAKE ME BACK, DAMN IT. I'M GETTING COLD.

1323
01:16:33,232 --> 01:16:35,472
NOW CALM DOWN, LIONEL. YOU NEED THE FRESH AIR.

1324
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:40,303
WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1325
01:16:40,335 --> 01:16:41,935
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1326
01:16:44,174 --> 01:16:46,222
I HOPE YOU ROT IN HELL.

1327
01:16:46,254 --> 01:16:47,662
HOLY SHIT!

1328
01:16:47,694 --> 01:16:49,998
CINDY'S GETTING AWAY! GET HER!

1329
01:16:52,877 --> 01:16:54,637
GET BACK!

1330
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:57,293
AH! AAH!

1331
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:00,525
HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BASTARDS BEEN?

1332
01:17:00,556 --> 01:17:03,468
THAT GIRL'S TRYING TO KILL ME, NOW SHE'S GETTING AWAY!

1333
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,100
I DON'T PAY YOU GUYS TO STAND AROUND WITH YOUR BUMS--

1334
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:06,955
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

1335
01:17:08,044 --> 01:17:09,835
OH, FUCK!

1336
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:13,227
YOU EVER HEAR OF AN EMERGENCY BREAK-IT DILDO?

1337
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:14,603
JACK--

1338
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:15,787
SHUT UP AND THINK ABOUT--

1339
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:17,547
NO!

1340
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:35,048
I GUESS I DIDN'T PUT IT IN PARK.

1341
01:17:35,081 --> 01:17:36,712
NO KIDDING.

1342
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:46,823
CINDY'S HEADED UP TO THE HILLS.

1343
01:17:46,856 --> 01:17:48,424
TOMMY, GRAB ONE OF THOSE PICKUP TRUCKS.

1344
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:49,575
TAKE MR. POND BACK TO TOWN.

1345
01:17:49,607 --> 01:17:51,431
GET HER! GO AND GET HER!

1346
01:17:51,462 --> 01:17:54,183
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. COME ON, MR. POND.

1347
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,981
WITH LIGHTS FLASHING, SIRENS WAILING

1348
01:18:03,014 --> 01:18:05,989
AND MY KIDNEYS THROBBING, THE CHASE GOES ON.

1349
01:18:17,828 --> 01:18:19,972
I'LL TELL IT RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT TO STOP HER.

1350
01:18:20,004 --> 01:18:23,236
IF SHE GETS TO THE OLD TRUSSBERG MINE, WE'LL NEVER FIND HER.

1351
01:18:23,267 --> 01:18:25,635
THERE'S OVER 150 MILES OF TUNNELS THERE.

1352
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,043
HOLD ON!

1353
01:18:27,075 --> 01:18:29,635
CINDY DROVE LIKE MARTY,

1354
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,778
WHICH WAS ONE MORE REASON SHE HAD TO BE STOPPED.

1355
01:19:04,255 --> 01:19:05,534
COME ON, SHERIFF. LET'S GO!

1356
01:19:05,567 --> 01:19:07,102
WE SHOULDN'T GO IN THERE.

1357
01:19:07,135 --> 01:19:09,854
YOU SNEEZE OR EVEN CUT A FART, THIS PLACE WILL COME DOWN.

1358
01:19:09,886 --> 01:19:11,870
I'M TOO OLD TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SHIT.

1359
01:19:11,902 --> 01:19:13,598
DAMN CITY PECKERS.

1360
01:19:15,901 --> 01:19:17,373
LOOK OUT!

1361
01:19:17,405 --> 01:19:18,621
CINDY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

1362
01:19:21,596 --> 01:19:23,260
HOLD ON THERE, GIRL!

1363
01:19:26,268 --> 01:19:27,452
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

1364
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:47,738
BET SHE ENTERS THE SILVER MINE.

1365
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:49,433
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO IN THERE?

1366
01:19:51,226 --> 01:19:52,921
SHIT.

1367
01:20:06,424 --> 01:20:08,375
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT.

1368
01:20:08,408 --> 01:20:10,136
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND HER.

1369
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:12,247
THIS IS AS FAR AS I'M GOING TO GO.

1370
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:15,350
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS WHAT YOU SAY TO MY WIFE, YOU HEAR?

1371
01:20:15,383 --> 01:20:19,062
I'M GOING BACK. IF SHE COMES OUT, I'LL GET HER.

1372
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:20,854
NOW, IF THE TWO OF YOU HAD ANY SENSE AT ALL,

1373
01:20:20,886 --> 01:20:23,125
YOU'D FOLLOW ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

1374
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:26,517
SHERIFF, GIVE ME THE BIGGER FLASHLIGHT.

1375
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:28,437
WHATEVER.

1376
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:35,285
WELL, WHICH TUNNEL DO YOU WANT, MARTY?

1377
01:20:35,316 --> 01:20:36,628
WELL, CAN'T WE GO TOGETHER?

1378
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:39,988
NO, NO. SHE COULD GET BEHIND US. I DON'T WANT THAT.

1379
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:44,659
WELL, SHE COULD BE IN EITHER OF THESE TUNNELS, JACK.

1380
01:20:44,692 --> 01:20:47,059
THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEARCHING THEM, MARTY.

1381
01:20:47,091 --> 01:20:48,691
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

1382
01:21:16,912 --> 01:21:18,767
JACK!

1383
01:21:21,231 --> 01:21:23,663
I DIDN'T APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DID ON HORACE JUNIOR.

1384
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:26,255
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1385
01:21:26,286 --> 01:21:27,950
I'M SURE YOU MISS HIM.

1386
01:21:30,767 --> 01:21:32,942
YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE, JACK.

1387
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,662
I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

1388
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:48,204
AH!

1389
01:21:55,308 --> 01:21:56,940
CINDY!

1390
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:58,635
CINDY, STOP!

1391
01:22:01,802 --> 01:22:03,562
CINDY!

1392
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,562
HEY!

1393
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:19,401
DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT!

1394
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:34,439
CINDY!

1395
01:22:49,637 --> 01:22:51,589
SORRY, MARTY.

1396
01:22:51,621 --> 01:22:54,277
IT AMAZES ME HOW YOU CAN BE SO SMART YET SO STUPID,

1397
01:22:54,309 --> 01:22:56,197
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

1398
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:57,861
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1399
01:22:57,892 --> 01:22:59,396
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE.

1400
01:22:59,429 --> 01:23:02,116
GET OVER IT.

1401
01:23:12,771 --> 01:23:15,106
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THREE THINGS I'VE LEARNED AS A P.I.

1402
01:23:15,139 --> 01:23:17,794
NEVER TRUST A WOMAN, GET IT ALL ON TAPE

1403
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,810
AND ALWAYS BRING BACKUP.

1404
01:23:19,842 --> 01:23:22,466
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BACKUP.

1405
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:25,921
RIGHT. LET'S GO.

1406
01:23:25,954 --> 01:23:27,361
GOOD WORK, KID.

1407
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:29,025
WHERE'S JACK?

1408
01:23:29,057 --> 01:23:30,977
NOW, YOU JUST SETTLE DOWN THERE, CINDY. SETTLE DOWN.

1409
01:23:31,009 --> 01:23:32,769
SHERIFF, WHERE'S JACK?

1410
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,297
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE RUMBLE?

1411
01:23:35,328 --> 01:23:37,920
THERE WAS A CAVE-IN.

1412
01:23:37,952 --> 01:23:40,575
LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR PARTNER, BUT HE'S A GONER.

1413
01:23:40,608 --> 01:23:42,528
SHIT.

1414
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,223
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?

1415
01:23:45,823 --> 01:23:48,607
HE'S MY PARTNER.

1416
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:49,631
IT'S SUICIDE TO GO BACK IN THERE!

1417
01:23:51,263 --> 01:23:54,366
JACK! JACK!

1418
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:56,190
YOU JUST BEHAVE YOURSELF, SILKY BUTT.

1419
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:03,933
JACK!

1420
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:06,717
JACK?

1421
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:08,156
MARTY.

1422
01:24:08,189 --> 01:24:10,365
JACK!

1423
01:24:10,396 --> 01:24:11,516
MARTY...

1424
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:12,988
HOLD ON, JACK.

1425
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,132
MARTY...

1426
01:24:15,164 --> 01:24:17,020
HOLD ON.

1427
01:24:18,427 --> 01:24:19,804
JACK, HOLD ON.

1428
01:24:19,835 --> 01:24:21,147
MARTY.

1429
01:24:24,763 --> 01:24:26,779
JACK.

1430
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:29,434
JACK...

1431
01:24:29,466 --> 01:24:30,810
JACK, ARE YOU OKAY?

1432
01:24:30,842 --> 01:24:33,146
DO I LOOK OKAY? DON'T I LOOK JUST GREAT?

1433
01:24:33,178 --> 01:24:34,650
OKAY.

1434
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:41,881
UH...

1435
01:24:41,913 --> 01:24:45,721
UH, JACK...

1436
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:50,872
UH, JACK, YOU SEEM TO BE TRAPPED NEAR A BIG SNAKE NEST.

1437
01:24:50,904 --> 01:24:52,823
YEAH, I KNOW.

1438
01:24:54,391 --> 01:24:57,303
JACK, I'M AFRAID OF SNAKES.

1439
01:24:57,335 --> 01:25:00,311
LISTEN TO ME, YOU LITTLE SON OF A BITCH.

1440
01:25:00,342 --> 01:25:03,511
YOU GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME HERE, AND I'LL TELL YOU,

1441
01:25:03,542 --> 01:25:07,702
MY GHOST WILL HAUNT YOU TILL THE END OF ETERNITY!

1442
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:09,845
UH... OKAY.

1443
01:25:09,878 --> 01:25:11,286
GET ME OUT!

1444
01:25:11,317 --> 01:25:13,462
OKAY.

1445
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,845
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!

1446
01:25:21,876 --> 01:25:23,732
UGH!

1447
01:25:26,068 --> 01:25:28,052
OKAY.

1448
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:29,395
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

1449
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:30,996
I AM!

1450
01:25:48,305 --> 01:25:49,969
HURRY UP. HURRY UP!

1451
01:25:51,633 --> 01:25:53,297
THAT WAY, JACK! HURRY UP!

1452
01:25:57,328 --> 01:25:59,536
THIS WAY! QUICK!

1453
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:01,584
DO IT! QUICK! HURRY UP!

1454
01:26:18,446 --> 01:26:20,109
AH.

1455
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,445
YOU WANT A MINT?

1456
01:26:26,477 --> 01:26:28,333
YEAH.

1457
01:26:38,988 --> 01:26:43,691
I WAS PROUD OF MARTY, PROUD TO CALL HIM A DICK.

1458
01:26:43,723 --> 01:26:46,219
CINDY WAS ON HER WAY TO THE SLAMMER,

1459
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:48,747
WHERE SHE'LL BE VERY POPULAR.

1460
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:51,690
OUR WORK HERE WAS DONE. MY WORK WAS DONE FOR GOOD.

1461
01:26:51,723 --> 01:26:53,354
HELLO, SHERIFF.

1462
01:26:53,386 --> 01:26:55,178
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1463
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,650
YOU LOVE ME IN HANDCUFFS, DON'T YOU, ALTON?

1464
01:26:56,681 --> 01:26:59,593
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH. COME ON.

1465
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:02,217
NOW, HERE'S THE ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1466
01:27:02,249 --> 01:27:04,905
WHY WOULD SO MANY PEOPLE GO TO SO MUCH TROUBLE

1467
01:27:04,937 --> 01:27:06,696
TO GET HOLD OF A WORTHLESS HOLE IN THE GROUND?

1468
01:27:06,729 --> 01:27:08,360
YEAH.

1469
01:27:08,393 --> 01:27:09,865
NO ONE'S TOLD YOU?

1470
01:27:09,896 --> 01:27:11,784
TOLD ME WHAT?

1471
01:27:11,816 --> 01:27:13,896
HEY, YOU'RE RICH, LIONEL.

1472
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:16,391
RICH?

1473
01:27:16,424 --> 01:27:19,207
YOU'VE GOT A VALUABLE MINERAL ON YOUR PROPERTY CALLED RUTILE.

1474
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:22,055
WHY--

1475
01:27:22,087 --> 01:27:23,655
YOU HEAR THAT? I'M RICH.

1476
01:27:23,687 --> 01:27:25,063
OH.

1477
01:27:25,094 --> 01:27:26,983
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE FILTHY RICH.

1478
01:27:27,014 --> 01:27:29,094
YOU HEAR THAT?

1479
01:27:29,126 --> 01:27:30,822
I'M RICH!

1480
01:27:32,357 --> 01:27:37,029
OH, I'VE BEEN A ROTTEN S.O.B. IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

1481
01:27:37,061 --> 01:27:39,973
I WANT TO SAY ONE THING TO YOU ALL.

1482
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:44,196
YOU ARE WITHOUT DOUBT THE ROTTENEST BUNCH

1483
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:48,708
OF MISCREANT FREAKS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!

1484
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:52,323
I'M FINALLY GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS CRUMMY SHIT HOLE OF A TOWN

1485
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:54,947
AND HAVE ME SOME FUN!

1486
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:58,051
'CAUSE I'M RICH! YOU HEAR?

1487
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,619
YOU HEAR THAT?

1488
01:28:02,178 --> 01:28:04,322
SHIT.

1489
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:08,770
HE'S DOWN!

1490
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:13,057
IS HE BREATHING?

1491
01:28:13,089 --> 01:28:17,024
HEY. HEY.

1492
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:22,880
MR. POND MAY BE RICH, BUT HE'S ALSO DEAD.

1493
01:28:22,912 --> 01:28:26,719
DAMN, HE SURE IS.

1494
01:28:26,752 --> 01:28:28,447
COME ON, FOLKS.

1495
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:31,199
LET'S GET HIM OUT OF THE SUN BEFORE HE STARTS TO DRAW FLIES.

1496
01:28:31,231 --> 01:28:32,287
WHO'S GOING TO GET HIS MONEY?

1497
01:28:32,318 --> 01:28:33,727
NEXT OF KIN!

1498
01:28:33,759 --> 01:28:34,783
WELL, I'M HIS COUSIN.

1499
01:28:34,815 --> 01:28:36,318
SO AM I!

1500
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:37,342
HELL, WE'RE ALL HIS COUSINS!

1501
01:28:37,374 --> 01:28:39,934
WHILE POND'S CARCASS WAS HAULED AWAY,

1502
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:43,198
MARTY AND I HAULED ASS OUT BACK TO L.A. AND A NEW BEGINNING.

1503
01:28:43,229 --> 01:28:46,206
FOR ME, THAT MEANT A ONE-WAY TICKET TO THE FLORIDA KEYS.

1504
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:49,853
FOR MARTY, THE KEYS TO MY OFFICE.

1505
01:28:49,885 --> 01:28:53,021
I CAST HIM AS MY REPLACEMENT.

1506
01:28:53,053 --> 01:28:54,556
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, MARTY,

1507
01:28:54,589 --> 01:28:57,212
I FORGIVE YOU FOR TRASHING MY CHERRY CHEVELLE

1508
01:28:57,244 --> 01:28:59,580
AND MY TRIPPED UP VAN.

1509
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:01,883
AH, WELL, THAT'S REALLY BIG OF YOU, JACK

1510
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,355
IS THAT YOUR UPTIGHT, REPRESSED WAY OF THANKING ME

1511
01:29:03,387 --> 01:29:05,019
FOR SAVING YOUR LIFE?

1512
01:29:05,052 --> 01:29:08,123
HEY, COME ON. KID, I SAVED YOUR LIFE, TOO, REMEMBER?

1513
01:29:08,155 --> 01:29:10,203
WELL, YEAH, BUT I WAS IN A HELL OF A LOT MORE DANGER

1514
01:29:10,235 --> 01:29:12,059
WHEN I SAVED YOUR LIFE THAN WHEN YOU SAVED MINE.

1515
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:15,034
OH, SHIT. I WAS IN MORE DANGER.

1516
01:29:15,066 --> 01:29:17,754
JACK, YOU GAVE ME A GUN WITH NO BULLETS. THAT'S BULLSHIT.

1517
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:19,738
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO HURT YOURSELF.

1518
01:29:19,769 --> 01:29:22,361
HURT MYSELF?

1519
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:31,000
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1520
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,728
NOTHING.

1521
01:29:40,599 --> 01:29:42,807
SO THAT'S MY STORY, AND I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU

1522
01:29:42,839 --> 01:29:45,591
THAT I'VE BEEN AN ALL-STATE CUSTOMER FOR 37 YEARS.

1523
01:29:45,622 --> 01:29:48,310
PLEASE REMIT A CHECK TO REPLACE MY CHEVELLE AND VAN

1524
01:29:48,343 --> 01:29:51,222
TO JACK POTTER, CARE OF POTTER'S RODS AND WORMS,

1525
01:29:51,254 --> 01:29:54,421
KEY LARGO, FLA, AND DON'T BOTHER CALLING.

1526
01:29:54,454 --> 01:29:56,214
THERE IS NO PHONE.
