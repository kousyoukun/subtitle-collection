2
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:01,602
Michael?

3
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,533
What are you doing? lt's after 12.

4
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,531
Couldn't sleep, Pops.

5
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,253
Neither can we,
with the noise you're making.

6
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,847
Let's go inside.

7
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:15,772
Just one more shot?

8
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:19,002
All right.

9
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,448
Just one.

10
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:26,089
Good. Shoot it again.

11
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:32,612
Getting pretty good. Shoot till you miss.

12
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:36,485
You think if l can get good enough,
l can go to college?

13
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,091
lf you get good enough,
you can do anything you want.

14
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:45,243
l want to play at North Carolina.

15
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,209
That's a real fine school.

16
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,443
You can get a good education.

17
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,042
l want to play on a championship team.

18
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:57,083
Then l want to play in the NBA.

19
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,049
All right, let's slow down, son.

20
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:04,443
Shouldn't you get some sleep first?

21
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:06,331
Once l've done all that...

22
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,768
...l want to play baseball, like you.

23
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,163
Baseball. Yeah, now, that's a sport.

24
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,166
When you've done that...

25
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:15,448
...l suppose you're going to fly?

26
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,292
At this time...

27
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:46,568
...l've reached the pinnacle of my
basketball career and must retire.

28
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:50,248
The one good thing is that my
father had the opportunity...

29
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:52,608
...to see me play my last game.

30
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:53,967
That means a lot.

31
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,691
What'll you do now?

32
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:59,163
l've never really told anybody this,
except for one person.

33
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:02,487
l'm going to play professional baseball.

34
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,325
What are you going to play?

35
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,927
l don't know. As a kid, l was a pitcher.

36
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:10,085
l think outfield,
because it'll be hard for me to pitch.

37
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:03,009
Let's get out of here. This stinks.

38
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,090
Don't bring me again.

39
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:06,732
Don't bring me again.

40
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,451
Are you listening?

41
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:12,925
Did you hear him? Did you hear him?
That little brat is right.

42
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,482
l told you, if l've told you once...

43
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:19,692
...l told you a thousand, thousand,
thousand, thousand times!

44
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,889
We need new attractions!

45
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,049
New ones!

46
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:24,849
Get it?

47
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,525
Big, shiny new things.

48
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:27,842
Absolutely, sir.

49
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,491
Look at me and listen:

50
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,288
The customer is always right!

51
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,169
Right!

52
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,483
The customer is always right!

53
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:36,802
Exactly!

54
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:38,732
Always!

55
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:40,962
Right!

56
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:44,489
Okay, we need something.
We need something...

57
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,682
...nutty!

58
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:49,932
Something wacky.

59
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:50,923
Wacky!

60
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,447
We need something, something....

61
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:55,046
Looney? Oops!

62
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,646
Looney. Thank you!

63
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:57,922
Looney?

64
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:07,967
Yes! Looney!

65
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:10,292
Now you're talking!

66
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,489
Looney! Looney! That's it!

67
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:15,042
That's the word l was looking for!

68
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,408
Get the Looney Tunes.

69
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:18,892
Bring them here.

70
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:20,526
Sir, just noticing...

71
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,125
...they're from Earth.
What if they can't come?

72
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:27,849
What did you say?
What if they can't come?

73
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,248
Make them.

74
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:31,243
Cool.

75
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,766
Make them!

76
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:34,890
We're gonna get them!

77
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,005
Strike!

78
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:50,926
Looks good in that uniform.

79
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,243
Looks great. Can't teach that.

80
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,562
Can't teach it.

81
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:57,531
Thanks for autographing
that basketball for my kid.

82
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,126
l'm happy to do it.

83
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,567
Let's go!

84
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,164
Curve ball. Don't swing.

85
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,569
Don't...swing.

86
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:17,528
Ball!

87
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,962
Fastball, outside corner. Swing.

88
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:30,372
Strike!

89
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:32,207
That was your pitch.

90
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,772
l know, l missed it.

91
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,123
l'll get you another one.

92
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:40,442
Podolak!

93
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:41,842
Come here.

94
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:44,447
-l'm sorry, l didn't mean to--
-Come here!

95
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,208
Make sure that nobody bothers Michael.

96
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,488
l want him to be the happiest player.

97
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,368
Slider. Don't swing.

98
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,407
Strike three!

99
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:01,972
l told you not to!

100
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:03,049
l couldn't help it.

101
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,249
l know. Nice talking to you!

102
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:14,690
We're not worried.

103
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,052
Good cut.

104
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,443
That was a good-looking strikeout.

105
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:28,242
You look good when you strike out.
When l do, it looks nasty.

106
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:30,643
At least you look good. Good-looking.

107
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,371
Hi, Mr. Jordan.

108
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:36,646
l'm Stan Podolak.

109
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:41,367
Oh, jeez.

110
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,288
You okay?

111
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:48,404
That was a nasty fall.

112
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,408
l'm Stan Podolak, Mr. Jordan,
the Baron's new publicist.

113
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:57,330
l'm here to make your life easier.
Can l drive you somewhere?

114
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:01,042
You want me to pick up your laundry,
baby-sit your kids?

115
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,773
l am here to personally guarantee...

116
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:06,493
...that no one will ever bother you.

117
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:16,887
What was that?

118
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:22,848
Hang on!

119
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,402
-Hanging on!
-Hanging on!

120
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,485
Are we there yet?

121
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:37,606
-Bombastic!
-Cool.

122
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:51,972
You irascible bunny!
Come back here, you screwy rodent!

123
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:56,446
l'll be with you in a second, folks,
after l finish with nature boy here.

124
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,764
All right, you pesky rabbit.

125
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,566
l've got you now!

126
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:10,646
One small step for moi....

127
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,403
One giant leap for Moron Mountain!

128
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,488
And one whopper headache for Elmer Fudd.

129
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,889
Diminutive, ain't they?

130
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,613
We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.

131
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,769
-Have you seen him?
-Where is he?

132
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,002
ls he around?

133
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,644
Bugs Bunny, Bugs Bunny.

134
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,885
Say, does he have great big long ears?

135
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,447
Like this?

136
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,365
Does he hop around...

137
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,727
...like this?

138
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:50,850
Does he say, ''What's up, doc?'' like this:

139
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:54,921
What's up, doc?

140
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,049
Nope! Never heard of him.

141
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:03,404
You know,
maybe there is no intelligent life...

142
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,563
...out in the universe after all.

143
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:12,133
Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune.

144
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,488
What do you think we are? Stupid?

145
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:16,564
Don't move a muscle.

146
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:20,605
Okay, bunny, gather up your Tune pals.

147
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:24,403
-We're taking you for a ride.
-Move it.

148
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:27,451
Totally. All right.
So, like, where are we going?

149
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,052
Are we there yet?

150
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,763
-Sorry it took so long.
-Don't worry about it.

151
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,083
That exit on 65 wasn't clearly marked.

152
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:40,244
-Hold up, right here.
-Here?

153
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,242
Thanks, Sherm.

154
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,608
-Appreciate it.
-lt's Stan, Mike.

155
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,288
You can call me Sherm if you want.

156
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:55,685
l follow your career and l think you're
the greatest athlete that's ever lived.

157
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:57,762
How do l get out?

158
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,411
The door doesn't work.

159
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:01,851
lt's a classic.

160
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:05,210
lt's a classic, but it's got
a few peccadillos. Hold on.

161
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:06,647
A few?

162
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,565
lt's smoking too.

163
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,452
Thanks for the ride.

164
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:16,726
This is nice. This is a nice house.

165
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:18,929
Beautiful. What is that, Colonial?

166
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,332
lt's a nice house.

167
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:22,643
lf you need help with the house....

168
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,451
l'm fine, thanks.

169
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,843
You gave me a ride. Thanks.

170
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,527
l'll drive tomorrow, so l don't need a ride.

171
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,766
But thanks, though.

172
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,252
Too conspicuous?

173
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,249
Yeah.

174
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,127
Thanks, though.

175
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,170
-Tomorrow!
-See you tomorrow.

176
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,250
Come on! No, not today!

177
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,129
Get off me! Your breath!

178
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:58,490
Mr. Jordan, are you okay?
Get off of him, Charles!

179
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:00,609
Bad dog! Git!

180
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:04,129
Pooch, stop it!
Get off of him before l cook you!

181
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,170
Come on, come on, baby.

182
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,562
Get out!

183
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:17,847
Good game.

184
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,612
Hey, Jeff, you okay?

185
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:29,531
-How was your game?
-l don't want to talk about it.

186
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,361
How are you?

187
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,325
You're covered with drool!

188
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:42,687
That's your dog.

189
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,611
What's wrong with Jeff?

190
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,770
He lost 32 points in his average.

191
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:47,842
ls that all?

192
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,652
So that puts him at .685 or something.

193
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:52,212
He's batting what?

194
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:55,568
Smells good in here. What you cooking?

195
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:56,768
Chicken.

196
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:58,447
Chicken and what?

197
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,568
Collard greens.

198
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,848
Good. l need a good meal tonight.

199
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,926
ls everything okay?

200
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:09,369
l stunk up the place.
Hope baseball was a good idea.

201
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,286
It was another career
day for Michael Jordan.

202
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,605
What're you watching?

203
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,612
He had 3 strikeouts.

204
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:20,207
ls this the only thing on TV?
What's up with this?

205
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,285
His batting average is .214,
which is his weight.

206
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:26,323
Get this guy a tennis racquet!

207
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,724
Did everyone get mad at you?

208
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,565
No. Worse.

209
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,086
They were nice about it.

210
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:35,731
I know golf is your sport.

211
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,405
But not here.

212
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:41,088
You should open your stance.
lt might make you more aggressive.

213
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:44,282
You think so? l'll remember that.

214
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,409
Watching this hurt me more than you.

215
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:49,849
Why are you watching this stuff?
lt's bad for you.

216
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:56,769
There.

217
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,482
Road Runner.

218
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,689
Stop this cartoon!

219
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:14,122
We've got an emergency Cartoon
Character Union Meeting to go to.

220
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,961
Hey, wait for me! Hold your horses!

221
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,685
Where'd they go?

222
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:36,401
Stop the music!

223
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,285
Top duck coming through!

224
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:42,287
Jeez! lt's getting so a guy can't
even get himself wet around here!

225
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:44,569
What's the big emergency?

226
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:48,529
These little guys would like to
make an announcement. Here.

227
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:53,208
You...

228
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,562
...all of you...

229
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,769
...are now our prisoners!

230
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:02,523
Oh, we're in big trouble now.

231
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:07,010
We are taking you to our
theme park in outer space.

232
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:08,202
No fooling.

233
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:09,886
You'll be our slaves.

234
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:13,323
And placed on display for the
amusement of our customers.

235
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:16,202
Oh, fear clutches my breast.

236
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,964
We ain't a-going...

237
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:21,806
...nowheres!

238
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:29,688
Not so fast, doc.

239
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:33,011
You just can't turn us into slaves.
That would be bad.

240
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,323
You must let us defend ourselves.

241
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,842
Oh, yeah? Who says?

242
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:39,726
Just a sec.

243
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,729
Read.

244
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:43,008
What's this?

245
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:46,369
''Give them a chance
to defend themselves.''

246
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,207
Do we have to?

247
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:49,647
lt's a rule.

248
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,769
Okay. lt is in the rule book.

249
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:53,167
Una momento!

250
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,005
We must confer.

251
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:02,603
All right, troops. lt is for us to
choose a battlefield that affords us--

252
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:04,722
l got it.

253
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,128
Yes, Private Porkster?

254
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,802
How about we challenge them to a...

255
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,647
...spelling bee?

256
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,848
Say...

257
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:15,766
...we could have a bowling tournament.

258
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,164
Suffering succotash!

259
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:20,045
What's wrong with you?

260
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:21,805
Let's get a ladder...

261
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,129
...wait till the old lady's gone...

262
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,761
...and grab that little bird!

263
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:30,362
Whoa! Take a deep breath, Sly!

264
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:33,247
Okay, let's analyze the competition.

265
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,768
Now what are we looking at here?

266
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,892
We got a small race of invading aliens....

267
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,601
Small arms! Short legs!

268
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:44,926
Not very fast.

269
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,452
Tiny little guys.

270
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,683
Can't jump high.

271
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,567
We challenge you to a basketball game.

272
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,124
Basketball it is!

273
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:01,807
Basketball!

274
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:04,641
What is basketball?

275
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,052
-What's that?
-Beats me.

276
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,407
We didn't have that in school.

277
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:08,369
Lights!

278
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,011
Pardon me! Sorry.

279
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,206
Down in front!

280
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:17,083
An exhilarating team sport currently
growing rapidly in popularity...

281
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,005
...is basketball.

282
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:23,570
Unlike football and baseball,
only 5 men can play on a team.

283
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:27,772
It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle
game that requires quick wits...

284
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:30,763
...and even faster reflexes.

285
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,488
Here's how it's done professionally.

286
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,201
The National Basketball Association...

287
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,246
...featuring the best players in the world.

288
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,643
The best players in the world!

289
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:42,563
The best!

290
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:03,883
Excuse me. Oh, so sorry.

291
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:05,122
Excuse me.

292
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:07,932
Get off my nose!

293
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,004
Quiet, they're looking!

294
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,844
lt's basketball!

295
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:14,129
Where?

296
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,726
Whoa! Now what?

297
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:22,404
-She's looking.
-Close it up.

298
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,721
Tightly.

299
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,646
You poked me again.

300
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,288
Sweetheart?

301
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:30,364
l thought you'd get better seats.

302
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:34,844
-This is the best l could get.
-This guy's doing something weird.

303
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:37,851
Just let me watch the game.
Barkley is killing us.

304
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,445
Someone's killing someone!

305
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:42,171
No. Seriously?

306
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:43,601
A killer!

307
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:44,928
Let me see!

308
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,525
There! That's the killer!

309
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,561
He's big.

310
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,167
He's good.

311
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,325
He's mine!

312
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:56,688
Go get him!

313
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:11,562
Come on! Get back on defense!

314
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,803
Let's go! Get back on d!

315
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,366
What are you doing?

316
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,050
Time out! Call time out!

317
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:32,923
What's wrong with you?

318
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:34,288
Let him in.

319
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:35,442
Open up!

320
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:36,768
Open!

321
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:38,767
He did it.

322
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:42,171
l got it! l got his talent!

323
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:43,329
Super.

324
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:46,291
-Sit down, Chuck.
-Man, l'm fine! l am fine!

325
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:47,966
l played you too much.

326
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:50,009
-l'm not tired!
-Get the doctor.

327
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:01,165
You all right?

328
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,322
You sure?

329
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:05,326
Come on, we're okay.

330
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:07,005
Come on, let's go.

331
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:14,763
Come on, Patrick. Showtime!

332
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:19,051
What's wrong with him?

333
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:29,362
In a shocking development, 5 NBA
players were put on the disabled list...

334
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:33,492
...in the last 24 hours, all suffering
from the same mysterious ailment...

335
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:36,213
...that affects the player's coordination.

336
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,409
l'll be home in a few days.

337
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,852
Put your mom on.

338
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:44,326
How you doing?

339
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:47,088
Watching TV?

340
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,011
What's going on?

341
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:54,641
-You gonna be all right?
-I'm ready, Coach.

342
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:59,403
Looks like l retired just in time.

343
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:02,048
l must go.

344
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,693
l'll call you later. Love you, bye.

345
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:06,842
lt's open!

346
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:08,526
lt's game time!

347
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:10,251
Lace up your Nikes.

348
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:13,610
Grab your Gatorade and we'll
get a Big Mac on the way.

349
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:16,048
Now we go to the Los Angeles Forum...

350
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:19,091
...where the Lakers are
refusing to take the court.

351
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,247
Get dressed.

352
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:25,962
We got a game in 5 minutes!
We're talking a huge fine.

353
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,089
We can't go in the locker room.

354
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:31,489
You heard what happened to
Barkley and Ewing. There's germs.

355
00:24:31,573 --> 00:24:34,610
Cedric, that was in New York,
3,000 miles away.

356
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,412
Bacteria travels faster
than the speed of light.

357
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:39,768
Like ''lnvasion of the Body Snatchers.''

358
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:41,562
All right.

359
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:42,802
Dress in the hallway.

360
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:52,483
Okay, okay, which one of you
maroons has ever played basketball?

361
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:54,127
l have, Coach.

362
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:57,644
And there's an important question
l must ask you.

363
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,569
What do you think?
l'm partial to purple and gold.

364
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:07,570
lt's better with my coloring.

365
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:10,605
Nice outfit, Daffy.

366
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:15,009
The little aliens say it's
their turn to use the court.

367
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:18,444
Sure, let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out.

368
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:21,491
Too bad you can't practice
getting taller, boys.

369
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,287
Hey, little pig!

370
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,489
l wet myself.

371
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:12,807
Time to play a little basketball.

372
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:20,171
These little pipsqueaks just
turned into superstars!

373
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,483
They're monsters!

374
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:24,804
Suffering succotash!

375
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:27,009
They're ''monstars''!

376
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:30,041
Bye-bye.

377
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,284
l think we might need some help.

378
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:39,164
175 yards.

379
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:42,241
Okay, little fella. You my friend?

380
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:43,848
Or my enemy?

381
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:46,482
You are my friend. You are my ally.

382
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:49,727
You are my associate,
my personal assistant.

383
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:52,812
You are my weapon. You are leaving.

384
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:57,247
-Great shot.
-Nice shot.

385
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,164
You can stop posing now.

386
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:07,609
Good try.

387
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:08,921
Not bad.

388
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:10,884
-Something for you to shoot at.
-Hit it good.

389
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,326
Do my best.

390
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:15,168
Good shot.

391
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:16,728
l know.

392
00:27:17,693 --> 00:27:19,285
l must ask you something.

393
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:22,968
The NBA must face reality.
What's happening is serious.

394
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:25,767
They're going to need
new players with talent.

395
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:29,528
Skilled guys who never really
thought about a professional career.

396
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,812
Think l got a shot?

397
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:36,132
Come on, really?

398
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,402
Don't kid.

399
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,206
lt's a man's game.

400
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:42,163
-You can't play.
-What if l tried hard?

401
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:43,686
Keep it down.

402
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:46,091
lt's because l'm white.

403
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:48,323
No. Larry's white. So what?

404
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:51,053
Larry's not white. Larry's clear.

405
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,450
Get inside his ball!

406
00:27:58,013 --> 00:27:59,844
You clowns can't beat that.

407
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,765
-My best shot ever.
-You haven't played long.

408
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:03,127
A Hall-of-Fame shot.

409
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:05,443
-Nice shot, Mr. Bird.
-Larry, please.

410
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:06,807
Nice shot, Mr. Larry.

411
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,769
Nice shot.

412
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,172
You can do this.

413
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:12,008
Don't be nervous, you can do this.

414
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:14,892
You feel the NBA has to face reality,
don't you?

415
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:18,130
Look for some players where
they never looked before.

416
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:21,444
Just look at the ball.
Visualize where you want it to go.

417
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:23,921
Be the ball.

418
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,486
Get off the tee.

419
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:26,768
Can't jump.

420
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:30,242
Go on.

421
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:31,808
Close to the pin?

422
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,121
For dinner?

423
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:35,568
-Sounds good.
-l'll go close to the pin.

424
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,561
l'll have some.

425
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,168
Not bad.

426
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:42,842
Good shot.

427
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:44,328
Get down.

428
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:47,205
Look at that spin.

429
00:28:58,413 --> 00:28:59,402
Come on!

430
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:03,161
lt is alive!

431
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:09,769
My first hole in one.

432
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:14,565
Never seen one of these.

433
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,607
Nothing but the bottom of the cup.

434
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,446
-That's his ball too.
-Yeah, it's my ball.

435
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:23,410
Wait, let me get a picture!

436
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:24,972
You must smile.

437
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:27,886
Reach in for the ball and then smile, okay?

438
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:29,407
ls this good?

439
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:31,245
Just take the picture!

440
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,485
What kind of camera is that?

441
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,370
Don't point it at me.

442
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,763
-l didn't do anything!
-Where'd he go?

443
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:10,569
Look out for that first step,
doc, it's a real lulu.

444
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,248
Bugs Bunny?

445
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,403
You expected the Easter Bunny?

446
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,172
You're not real.

447
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:19,843
Not real? lf l weren't real, could l do this?

448
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:25,812
ls that Michael?

449
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:27,406
lt's Michael!

450
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:28,972
lt's Air Jordan.

451
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:31,686
Basketball!

452
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,286
l thought l saw....

453
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:36,808
l did. l did see Michael Jordan.

454
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:38,806
Pardon me, Mr. Jordan.

455
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:40,645
Can l have your auto--

456
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,045
Your John Hancock, please?

457
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,044
Let the doctor take a look.

458
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:48,847
A little high.

459
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,161
Going down!

460
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:00,970
So, what do you say we go for a little spin?

461
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,052
Let's see what we got inside here.

462
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:10,687
Say, ''Ahh.''

463
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:14,563
All right. He's okay!

464
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:17,766
What's going on here?

465
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,844
l thought you'd never ask.

466
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:24,166
These aliens from outer space want to
make us slaves in their theme park.

467
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:28,008
They're little. So we challenged
them to a basketball game.

468
00:31:28,173 --> 00:31:29,811
Then, they ain't so little!

469
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:32,566
They're huge! We need to beat these guys.

470
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,411
They're talking about slavery!

471
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:38,202
They'll make us do stand-up,
the same jokes every night!

472
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:41,689
We'll be locked up like wild animals,
trotted out to perform...

473
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:45,732
...for a bunch of bug-eyed, fat-headed,
humor-challenged aliens!

474
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:48,168
What l'm trying to say is...

475
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,722
...we need your help!

476
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:53,125
l'm a baseball player now.

477
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:56,091
Right. And l'm a Shakespearean actor.

478
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,282
Mike?

479
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:03,683
Michael? lt's Stan.

480
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:05,047
Stan Podolak.

481
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:07,683
l need you to come out now, okay?

482
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,923
You got a baseball game tomorrow.

483
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:12,766
And I'd look pretty stupid
ifyou don't show up.

484
00:32:13,853 --> 00:32:16,447
Think he's all right? l hate to leave him.

485
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:20,492
He's fine. l think he just had to
get away from that Stan character.

486
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,245
He's pathetic, isn't he?

487
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:26,892
l'll give us both twos. We weren't in
any kind of emotional state to putt.

488
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:28,532
l think that's fair.

489
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:33,052
lf Mike is gone, the NBA is
going to need some new people.

490
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,606
There's room at the top.

491
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:37,765
An exciting guy
who could even perform at half-time.

492
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:39,248
You know David Stern?

493
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,322
A phone call from you....

494
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:42,086
l want to help...

495
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,370
...but l haven't played in a long time.
My timing's off.

496
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,681
We'll fix it.

497
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:48,804
Look at our facility.

498
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:50,725
We got hoops.

499
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:52,965
We got weights.

500
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,328
We've got balls.

501
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,966
You sure do. This place is a mess.

502
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,931
You're worried about a mess?

503
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:04,369
There's nothing here a little
spit shine wouldn't fix.

504
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:06,447
Spit shine!

505
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:26,131
Lemony-fresh.

506
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:27,812
You guys are nuts.

507
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:30,885
Correction: We're Looney Tunes.

508
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:35,524
And as such are the exclusive property
and trademark of Warner Bros. lnc.

509
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:45,881
l'm here!

510
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:48,487
Me too!

511
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:51,252
That hurt.

512
00:33:53,453 --> 00:33:54,886
Who are they?

513
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:58,443
Remember the tiny aliens l told you about?

514
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:04,089
You've heard of the Dream Team?
We're the Mean Team, wussieman!

515
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:06,205
Wussieman.

516
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:07,965
We're the Monstars.

517
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,486
M-o-n-....

518
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:11,485
Let's see what you got...

519
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:12,608
...chump!

520
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:15,084
l don't play basketball anymore.

521
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:17,562
''l don't play basketball anymore.''

522
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:20,843
Maybe you're chicken.

523
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:24,601
l say, l resemble that remark.

524
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:26,411
You calling me chicken?

525
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:28,162
Come here.

526
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:33,485
Here you go. Take him!

527
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:35,326
Watch the footwork.

528
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:36,926
Can you believe it?

529
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,044
Get out of the way!

530
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:45,248
Everybody.

531
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:48,042
Look at your hero now.

532
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:53,684
You guys are making a mistake.

533
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:56,453
You're all washed up, baldy!

534
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,202
Baldy?

535
00:34:58,373 --> 00:34:59,806
He is not washed up!

536
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:01,963
-Michael's the greatest!
-Shut up!

537
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:08,044
My poor little cranium.

538
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:09,248
You okay?

539
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:11,165
Yeah, are you okay?

540
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:12,689
Whoops!

541
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:15,241
You're not scared of them...

542
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:16,768
...are you?

543
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:27,324
Let's play some basketball.

544
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:49,528
You're...!

545
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:51,731
You're Charles Barkley.

546
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,931
Girls! Come on over! Hurry up! Hurry!

547
00:35:56,093 --> 00:35:58,323
Look! lt's Charles Barkley!

548
00:35:58,493 --> 00:35:59,608
Can l play?

549
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:26,645
You're not Charles Barkley.

550
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,803
Just a wanna-be who looks like him.

551
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,725
Sorry.

552
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:32,008
Break out.

553
00:36:32,253 --> 00:36:34,721
You shouldn't even be here! Be gone!

554
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,043
Wanna-be! Be gone!

555
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:39,206
Just a few more tests.

556
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:43,286
Electrolyte levels,
glucose, CBCs, RBCs, etc.

557
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:46,003
And we've scheduled a stress test...

558
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:49,768
...and neurological battery
to include EEG and....

559
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:51,924
And this girl...

560
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,202
...five feet nothing, blocked my shot.

561
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,763
When did you first have this dream?

562
00:36:58,013 --> 00:37:00,481
lt wasn't a dream! lt really happened!

563
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:05,126
lt climbed up my back...

564
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,805
...and into my brain.

565
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,965
Are there other areas...

566
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:10,885
...besides basketball...

567
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:12,964
...where you find yourself...

568
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,525
...unable to perform?

569
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:19,129
No!

570
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:20,408
Just asking.

571
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:27,605
l've been MRl'd, EKG'd,
x-rayed, laser beamed....

572
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,684
l'll never swear again.

573
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:31,844
l'll never get another technical.

574
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,446
l'll never trash-talk.

575
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:36,411
l've got other skills.
l could go work on the farm.

576
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:37,209
Really?

577
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:40,649
Or maybe l could go back to
the jungle and be a missionary.

578
00:37:40,813 --> 00:37:43,691
What are you saying?
That l'm trying to disobey my mama?

579
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:45,525
You said that, not me.

580
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:46,808
l love her.

581
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,884
Still can't find anything wrong!

582
00:37:49,053 --> 00:37:50,566
Maybe nothing's wrong!

583
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,883
Maybe it's just in our head.

584
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,362
We're fine. lt's psychosomatic.

585
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,444
Or has to do with the moon.

586
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,444
l'll never date Madonna again.

587
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:07,126
What are you doing?

588
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,766
l'm fixing a divot.

589
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:13,924
He's fixing a divot!

590
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:45,453
Has anyone here ever played basketball?

591
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:47,048
l have.

592
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:49,925
l'd like to try out.

593
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:53,763
Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.

594
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:55,446
Lola?

595
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,602
Hello!

596
00:38:57,773 --> 00:39:00,082
My name's Bugs.

597
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:02,963
You want to play one-on-one, doll?

598
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:04,168
''Doll''?

599
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,805
On the court, Bugs.

600
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:11,364
She's hot!

601
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:15,047
Ready?

602
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:18,886
l got it! l got it!

603
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,924
That girl's got some skills.

604
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:30,726
Don't ever call me...

605
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:32,246
...''doll.''

606
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:34,647
Check!

607
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,884
Nice playing with you.

608
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:41,047
Very smooth.

609
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,602
She's obviously nuts about me.

610
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:44,842
Obviously.

611
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:46,088
Mais oui.

612
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:47,606
Where's the ball?

613
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:50,645
Let's do some drills.

614
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:58,003
Can anyone lend me some sneakers?

615
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,246
Sneakers?

616
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:04,569
Sorry.

617
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,213
Someone must get my gear
from my house.

618
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:08,647
Your house?

619
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:10,724
ln 3-D land?

620
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:12,406
Whatever you do...

621
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:15,043
...remember my North Carolina shorts.

622
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:17,522
Your shorts? From college?

623
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,765
l wore them under my Chicago Bulls
uniform every game.

624
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,642
l washed them after every game!

625
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,407
l did!

626
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:30,642
The view back here stinks.

627
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,410
We're in front of his house.

628
00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:36,245
l knew that!

629
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,646
Let's go in this way.

630
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,202
l say, let's go in that way!

631
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:44,323
He just never learns!

632
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:48,245
Let me see.

633
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,643
l must be very, very...

634
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,326
...close.

635
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,608
Mother!

636
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,567
Nice digs.

637
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:08,252
Well, well. l wonder who that could be.

638
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:13,533
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

639
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,724
Everyone's sleeping!

640
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:18,008
l knew that.

641
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:21,529
Come on, we must find
Michael's basketball stuff.

642
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:24,884
Nope. Nothing in here.

643
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:26,888
Nope.

644
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:29,123
But a very nice dinette set.

645
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:30,887
Not here.

646
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,446
Let's look upstairs.

647
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,603
Yes, Oh, Fearless Leader.

648
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:38,721
So, he needs his special underwear.

649
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:42,443
Sorry.

650
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:44,529
You think she's got enough toys?

651
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:47,531
Speaking of toys,
you know all those mugs and...

652
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:50,082
...lunch boxes with our pictures on them?

653
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:52,644
You ever see any money from it?

654
00:41:53,693 --> 00:41:55,331
-Not a cent.
-Me neither.

655
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:56,967
lt's a shame.

656
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,693
We need a new agent.
We're getting screwed.

657
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,846
We've found the trophy room.

658
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:03,844
Spread out and search the place.

659
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:05,525
Yes, sahib.

660
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:06,728
Oh, brother.

661
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:08,963
Here l am, in the peak of my form...

662
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:12,409
...playing second banana to
some sort of harebrain....

663
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,485
This could be useful.

664
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:17,485
lf this were a union job....

665
00:42:17,573 --> 00:42:19,325
That's very nice.

666
00:42:20,133 --> 00:42:22,283
-l could use this.
-One of his shoes.

667
00:42:27,093 --> 00:42:28,685
Where is the other shoe?

668
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:32,249
Where are you?

669
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:33,888
Eureka!

670
00:42:35,093 --> 00:42:36,890
Come to Papa.

671
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:43,011
What a fuzz-foot. You are so clumsy.

672
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,168
Catch.

673
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,443
Thanks.

674
00:42:50,013 --> 00:42:51,651
Time to go.

675
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:53,843
Did we get everything?

676
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,085
The shorts!

677
00:42:56,733 --> 00:42:58,007
ln there?

678
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:00,570
Okay, l'll check.

679
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:06,803
l found the shorts.

680
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:12,844
The pain!

681
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:14,886
l'm right behind you.

682
00:43:14,973 --> 00:43:16,611
That's not reassuring.

683
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:17,802
Nice puppy.

684
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,088
Want a bone?

685
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:21,167
No dice.

686
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,085
How about a nice ham?

687
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,845
Can't we talk this over?

688
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:26,765
Down, Beethoven.

689
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:28,685
The kids are here.

690
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:32,007
Give it.

691
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:36,769
Here.

692
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:38,492
Thanks, kid.

693
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:41,691
Bad dog!

694
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:46,445
That is the last time l'm ever
working with dogs or children.

695
00:43:47,573 --> 00:43:48,892
Where you going?

696
00:43:49,053 --> 00:43:53,365
You see, the Looney Tunes have a
big basketball game coming up and...

697
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:55,643
-...your dad's playing.
-All right!

698
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,368
Yeah! But don't tell anybody!

699
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:15,367
l see aliens.

700
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,813
Little aliens from outer space.

701
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:22,486
They forced their way inside your bodies.

702
00:44:22,653 --> 00:44:25,372
They need your talent to win a...

703
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:27,888
...basketball game against...

704
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:29,646
...Bugs Bunny.

705
00:44:30,173 --> 00:44:32,562
l also see Michael Jordan...

706
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:36,050
...being sucked down a golf hole...

707
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:37,806
...by furry creatures.

708
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:39,565
That's it. We're going.

709
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:40,881
We're leaving.

710
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:42,446
Let's try acupuncture.

711
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:43,727
Good idea.

712
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:46,842
This is it! This is it!

713
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:49,043
l don't know where you are...

714
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:53,485
...but you obviously enjoy being
there more than being with me!

715
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:56,611
You better hope this Jordan
character still can play.

716
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:58,924
You and me both, brother.

717
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:01,653
Listen, how is this for a new team name:

718
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:03,452
The Ducks.

719
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:04,609
Please!

720
00:45:04,693 --> 00:45:08,208
What kind of Mickey Mouse
organization would name a team that?

721
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:11,087
So sue me. lt's just a suggestion.

722
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:16,806
You're doing it!

723
00:45:16,973 --> 00:45:18,406
You're becoming mighty!

724
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:19,448
Go!

725
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:21,126
No pain, no gain.

726
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:27,767
Guys?

727
00:45:29,373 --> 00:45:32,445
Look who's finally ready to play!

728
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,884
Let's see if l remember how.

729
00:46:14,213 --> 00:46:16,124
ls it really you?

730
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:20,048
Thank God you're all right!

731
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:22,363
l was so worried!

732
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:24,848
Come on, Stan. Don't hug me, please.

733
00:46:25,053 --> 00:46:25,769
Sorry.

734
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:29,084
-Why are you here?
-l must take you back for practice.

735
00:46:29,213 --> 00:46:32,410
l can't. l'm helping my friends
in their basketball game.

736
00:46:37,013 --> 00:46:39,163
Your friends are cartoon characters.

737
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:41,847
Yeah. So?

738
00:46:42,653 --> 00:46:44,006
lt doesn't bother me.

739
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,766
Let me help? Let me help! l can help!

740
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:48,366
What can you do?

741
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:50,770
l may not be tall, but...

742
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:52,328
...l'm slow.

743
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:53,846
And large.

744
00:46:54,053 --> 00:46:55,168
And a dork!

745
00:46:55,253 --> 00:46:57,209
l'll do anything! Anything!

746
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:58,368
Anything?

747
00:46:58,453 --> 00:46:59,488
Anything.

748
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:03,283
Come here. Come here for a second.

749
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,366
Sit right here.

750
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:07,406
No problem.

751
00:47:07,573 --> 00:47:10,133
All right! All right, let's go, team!

752
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:14,132
lf someone gets injured,
we could see a lot of minutes.

753
00:47:14,213 --> 00:47:16,408
l'm a cheerleader.

754
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,361
Mr. Commissioner, the place is sealed off.

755
00:47:40,173 --> 00:47:41,447
Quiet!

756
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:44,492
Listen. After meeting with team owners...

757
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,213
...l decided that until we can guarantee...

758
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:49,523
...the health of our players...

759
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:53,049
...there will be no more
basketball this season.

760
00:48:30,613 --> 00:48:32,683
Just get out of my way.

761
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:40,323
Ready?

762
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:42,528
Let's go!

763
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:49,884
Are these the best seats?

764
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:51,088
Like them!

765
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:54,771
Can see everything from here! Very good!

766
00:49:01,493 --> 00:49:02,926
Ready to go?

767
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:04,486
Yeah, sure.

768
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:05,608
Riot!

769
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:10,491
Ladies and gentlemen...

770
00:49:10,893 --> 00:49:13,612
...the starting lineup for...

771
00:49:13,773 --> 00:49:15,843
...the Tune Squad!

772
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:19,203
Standing 2 foot 4...

773
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,251
...The Wonder From Down Under...

774
00:49:22,413 --> 00:49:24,244
...the Tazmanian Devil!

775
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:31,048
At small forward...

776
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:34,330
...standing a scintillating 3 foot 2...

777
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:36,645
...The Heartthrob of the Hoops...

778
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:37,927
...Lola Bunny!

779
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:44,726
At power forward...

780
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:48,249
...The Quackster of the Courts: Daffy Duck!

781
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:50,005
Thank you! Thank you!

782
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:54,406
Very funny.

783
00:49:54,573 --> 00:49:56,723
Let's all laugh at the duck.

784
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,804
And at point guard...

785
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:02,807
...standing 3 foot 3,

786
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,442
...co-captain of the Tune Squad...

787
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:07,569
...The Doctor of Delight:

788
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:09,685
Bugs Bunny!

789
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:11,605
Thank you! Thank you!

790
00:50:13,853 --> 00:50:15,525
And now...

791
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:18,412
...the player-coach of the Tune Squad...

792
00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:22,090
...at 6 foot 6, from North Carolina...

793
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,403
...His Royal Airness:

794
00:50:24,653 --> 00:50:26,291
Michael Jordan!

795
00:50:31,453 --> 00:50:32,568
Who?

796
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,166
ls he a Looney Tune?

797
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,088
Perhaps.

798
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:40,409
Ready?

799
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:42,006

800
00:50:42,093 --> 00:50:44,323
They'll wish they never were born!

801
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:46,802
Guys, let's just go out and have fun.

802
00:50:47,293 --> 00:50:49,853
The challengers for the Ultimate Game...

803
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:53,293
...all the way from Moron Mountain:

804
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:56,044
The Monstars!

805
00:51:02,613 --> 00:51:05,491
Go Monstars! Go Monstars!
Go Monstars!

806
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:15,562
What are you looking at?

807
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,491
Cool shoes.

808
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:29,403
Ready?

809
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,447
l got it! l got the ball!

810
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:48,651
Way to go!
Did you see the moves on that one?

811
00:51:49,813 --> 00:51:52,611
Come on. Show me something!

812
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:57,568
The duck!

813
00:52:04,653 --> 00:52:05,972
Oh, my!

814
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:08,209
She was wide open.

815
00:52:17,773 --> 00:52:19,525
Watch the screen!

816
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:20,842
Watch out!

817
00:52:21,813 --> 00:52:22,928
Get him!

818
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:29,724
How did he do that?

819
00:52:30,453 --> 00:52:32,364
Nice shot, Mr. J.

820
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:33,966
Let's play defense.

821
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:37,086
Way to go!

822
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,447
Air J!

823
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:41,808

825
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:43,888

Feed me!

827
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,401
-Bad old putty tat!
-l'll take that.

828
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:54,091
Don't try this at home!

829
00:52:56,213 --> 00:52:58,124
''l wish l was in the land of--''

830
00:52:58,293 --> 00:52:59,885
Going somewhere?

831
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:01,645
May l remind you, sir...

832
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:04,885
...that physical violence is
patently against the rules!

833
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:09,692
Did you order Original Recipe
or Extra Crispy?

834
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:14,288
Let's go.

835
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:15,169
Me?

836
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17,085
l'm ready. l can do this.

837
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:18,686
You picked the mouse?

838
00:53:18,773 --> 00:53:21,731
l love basketball. l always have. Do you?

839
00:53:21,893 --> 00:53:23,246
l bet you're good.

840
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:25,643
l'm small, but l try hard to be good.

841
00:53:25,813 --> 00:53:27,485
l always try hard.

842
00:53:27,653 --> 00:53:29,564
My mom says, ''Try your best--''

843
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:34,445
Try to get by me, doll.

844
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:36,127
''Doll''?

845
00:53:41,173 --> 00:53:42,845
Don't ever call me...

846
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:44,048
...''doll.''

847
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,532
Nice shot.

848
00:53:47,013 --> 00:53:49,971
There's the defense boy. l got you.

849
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:51,408
91 1 !

850
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:54,446
Pie? Pork chop?

851
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:56,046
Sorbet, perhaps?

852
00:54:11,733 --> 00:54:13,086
Half-time.

853
00:54:15,093 --> 00:54:16,526
Holy Putty Tat!

854
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,328
We're better than them.

855
00:54:20,653 --> 00:54:22,291
We got them.

856
00:54:22,453 --> 00:54:24,523
Moron Mountain, here we come.

857
00:54:24,853 --> 00:54:26,684
We're going to be slaves.

858
00:54:26,853 --> 00:54:29,128
There's a whole other half to play.

859
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:44,845
lt's the boss.

860
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,041
Hello, Mr. Swackhammer!

861
00:54:48,213 --> 00:54:49,248
All right.

862
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:53,089
Not bad for the first half.
But we must keep this up.

863
00:54:53,253 --> 00:54:54,368
No problem.

864
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:56,763
We stole talent from the NBA players!

865
00:54:57,173 --> 00:54:58,925
From the NBA!

866
00:55:00,373 --> 00:55:01,488
Shut up!

867
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,244
l smell something.

868
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:08,685
We've been playing hard.

869
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:11,083
Not you, you idiot!

870
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:14,845
lt's coming from over here.

871
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:16,722
That locker.

872
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:20,688
Look!

873
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:23,563
lt's the chubby boy!

874
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:25,932
lt smells like a...

875
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:27,726
...spy!

876
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,490
You guys need a publicist?
l can make you big.

877
00:55:34,053 --> 00:55:36,283
-l know we're down.
-Let's hear the story.

878
00:55:36,373 --> 00:55:37,965
l've been here before.

879
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:39,885
We can still win this.

880
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:42,248
lt's not over. We must come together.

881
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,210
We must believe in ourselves.

882
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:46,012
That'll help us.

883
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:52,124
Looks like Stan had a close
encounter with a bug-zapper.

884
00:55:53,013 --> 00:55:54,685
The Monstars!

885
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:56,047
The Monstars!

886
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:01,087
That must hurt.

887
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:03,807
The Monstars!

888
00:56:04,773 --> 00:56:05,888
The Monstars...

889
00:56:05,973 --> 00:56:08,771
...stole the talent from the NBA players.

890
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:14,442
So that's what happened to them.

891
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:17,891
l think we should qui-- qui-- forfeit.

892
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:22,685
Listen, l didn't get dragged down
here to lose to ugly Monstars.

893
00:56:22,853 --> 00:56:25,925
l ain't going out like that.
We're letting them push us!

894
00:56:27,013 --> 00:56:30,688
We must fight back!
We must get right in their faces!

895
00:56:31,893 --> 00:56:32,769
Well?

896
00:56:34,213 --> 00:56:35,805
Are you with me or not?

897
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:43,243
Finished? Great speech and all.

898
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:47,088
You had them riveted.
But didn't you forget something?

899
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:50,043
Your secret stuff!

900
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:00,525
Nice deltoids!

901
00:57:00,693 --> 00:57:01,808
Play along.

902
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:05,006
Stop hogging it.

903
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:06,492
We're teammates!

904
00:57:07,053 --> 00:57:08,805
Secret stuff?

905
00:57:09,013 --> 00:57:12,847
Secret stuff? You wouldn't
hold out on us, would you?

906
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:13,809
No.

907
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:17,966
l didn't think you needed it.
You're so tough. You're competitive.

908
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:20,931
We're also chicken. We need it bad.

909
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:25,011
-l'd like some of that.
-Could l have a sip, please?

910
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:28,210
This goes against everything
l learned in health class.

911
00:57:28,933 --> 00:57:30,127
Do you want to win?

912
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,646
Bottoms up.

913
00:57:33,413 --> 00:57:34,368
Yummy.

914
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:37,730
How about we go out
and kick some alien butt?

915
00:57:37,893 --> 00:57:39,406
How about it? Ready?

916
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:00,687
Open!

917
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:03,487
Coming through!

918
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,686
Special delivery!

919
00:58:20,973 --> 00:58:22,884
Nice kaboom.

920
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:40,690
Let's teach them a lesson.

921
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:47,202
Nice butt!

922
00:58:55,653 --> 00:58:56,927
Going up!

923
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:00,767
Slammy!

924
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:06,288
Hello! A little surprise for you, my friends.

925
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,208
2 points.

926
00:59:21,773 --> 00:59:23,525
This will be good.

927
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:36,927
Okay, birdie!

928
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:55,006
Time out!

929
00:59:59,373 --> 01:00:02,171
Shut up, get away from me. Powwow!

930
01:00:02,453 --> 01:00:05,490
We're right back in this game.
Let's play tough defense.

931
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:07,606
Why didn't you get him?

932
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:09,763
He's a baseball player.

933
01:00:09,933 --> 01:00:11,002
A baseball player.

934
01:00:11,093 --> 01:00:13,448
Looks like a basketball player to me.

935
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:15,251
Me too.

936
01:00:15,413 --> 01:00:17,688
He's the one l want for Moron Mountain.

937
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:22,404
Are you talking to me?

938
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:25,805
Yeah, l am. You want a piece of me?
Come and get it!

939
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:31,165
What do you have in mind?

940
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,169
What about we raise the stakes?

941
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,812
lnteresting.

942
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:41,085
lf we win, you give the NBA
players their talent back.

943
01:00:41,173 --> 01:00:42,845
But what if we win?

944
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:45,482
lf you win?

945
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:47,643
You get me.

946
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:48,802
Good deal.

947
01:00:48,973 --> 01:00:51,089
Doc, you think that's a good idea?

948
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:56,488
You'll be our star attraction.

949
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:00,332
You'll sign autographs all day long.

950
01:01:01,573 --> 01:01:04,167
And play one-on-one with
the paying customers.

951
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:08,002
And lose.

952
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:12,931
Do we have a deal?

953
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:17,489
Deal.

954
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:26,363
l don't think you should do this.

955
01:01:26,533 --> 01:01:28,205
l have faith in my team.

956
01:01:30,133 --> 01:01:31,088
Crush them!

957
01:01:32,933 --> 01:01:34,730
Defeating time, boys.

958
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:42,801
Good-bye!

959
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:51,366
Fore!

960
01:01:56,773 --> 01:01:59,765
But, Mommy,
l don't want to go to school today.

961
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:04,602
l want to stay home
and bake cookies with you.

962
01:02:07,653 --> 01:02:08,688
l'm open!

963
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:10,328
Heads up!

964
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:11,648
Belly flop!

965
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:16,008
Oh, my!

966
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:20,764
ls this your man?

967
01:02:21,453 --> 01:02:22,488
You okay?

968
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:25,123
Me? Oh, yeah. l'm fine.

969
01:02:25,293 --> 01:02:27,045
Are you okay?

970
01:02:28,493 --> 01:02:29,369
Thank you.

971
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:31,205
lt was nothing.

972
01:02:31,653 --> 01:02:35,328
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

973
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,088
Time out.

974
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:47,052
l could have been a contender!

975
01:02:47,213 --> 01:02:49,124
The Monstars! The Monstars!

976
01:02:49,293 --> 01:02:51,204
l could have had a V-8!

977
01:03:08,653 --> 01:03:10,371
We need a fifth player.

978
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:14,851
You got any more secret stuff?
l think it's starting to wear off.

979
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:17,129
lt didn't wear off. lt was water.

980
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,285
You guys had the ''special stuff''
inside you all along.

981
01:03:20,613 --> 01:03:23,047
Yeah, l knew that. But you got any more?

982
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:26,206
Can l have some?

983
01:03:27,973 --> 01:03:29,565
-Stan?
-Me?

984
01:03:30,893 --> 01:03:32,087
You're center.

985
01:03:32,613 --> 01:03:34,126
Just guard the big guy.

986
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:36,488
Guard him? l'll smother him!

987
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:40,612
l'll be all over him like a cheap suit!
l'll be on him like stink on rice!

988
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:42,092
He's going down!

989
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:49,529
Over here!

990
01:03:49,613 --> 01:03:50,682
Over here!

991
01:03:50,853 --> 01:03:51,888
l'm open!

992
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:04,648
Nice shot!

993
01:04:04,973 --> 01:04:07,043
Big man, ain't he?

994
01:04:12,613 --> 01:04:14,331
Let's get him out of here!

995
01:04:36,613 --> 01:04:38,092
Oh, my!

996
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:46,132
How'd he do that?

997
01:04:46,213 --> 01:04:47,566
Anyone can do that.

998
01:04:47,653 --> 01:04:48,802
Even you.

999
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:50,287
Watch this.

1000
01:04:51,413 --> 01:04:54,291
No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land.

1001
01:04:57,653 --> 01:05:00,850
10 seconds to go?
Thanks for telling me, doc.

1002
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:03,811
l hate to be the bearer of bad news,
Your Airness...

1003
01:05:03,893 --> 01:05:08,523
...but if you don't find a fifth player,
your team will forfeit the game.

1004
01:05:08,973 --> 01:05:09,689
Forfeit?

1005
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:11,411
Precisely, Sir Altitude.

1006
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:13,564
No way. We'll find someone.

1007
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:21,847
l didn't know Dan Ackroyd
was in this picture!

1008
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:26,607
Perhaps l could be of some assistance?

1009
01:05:27,573 --> 01:05:29,325
That's our fifth guy.

1010
01:05:29,813 --> 01:05:32,373
Now you get to live your dream. Let's go.

1011
01:05:33,773 --> 01:05:36,526
-We need to score 2 points.
-Here's how l see it.

1012
01:05:38,093 --> 01:05:40,732
You kick it to the girl
bunny down in the post.

1013
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:42,292
You dish it to Bugs.

1014
01:05:42,573 --> 01:05:45,610
You swing it to Mike. You go to the hole.

1015
01:05:45,773 --> 01:05:47,764
-And dominate!
-We're on defense!

1016
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:50,807
l don't play defense.

1017
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:51,609
Typical.

1018
01:05:51,693 --> 01:05:53,809
You must listen to Mike on this.

1019
01:05:53,973 --> 01:05:57,602
Someone steal the ball,
get it to me and l'll score.

1020
01:05:58,373 --> 01:06:00,091
Don't lose that confidence!

1021
01:06:00,493 --> 01:06:02,563
Paws and wings in here! Okay!

1022
01:06:08,613 --> 01:06:10,205
This is why l was born.

1023
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,046
l thrive on pressure.

1024
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:13,807
Excuse me, sorry.

1025
01:06:13,893 --> 01:06:16,043
Easy on the trousers, Daf.

1026
01:06:16,213 --> 01:06:19,967
Pardon me. Mr. Murray,
something's really been bugging me.

1027
01:06:20,133 --> 01:06:22,124
Just how did you get here?

1028
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:26,610
Producer's a friend of mine.
Had a teamster drop me off.

1029
01:06:28,213 --> 01:06:29,646
That's how it goes.

1030
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:32,044
You see this chunky fellow?

1031
01:06:38,053 --> 01:06:39,327
That's good!

1032
01:06:39,493 --> 01:06:40,972
Let's do it!

1033
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:42,368
Play fair.

1034
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:46,011
Don't choke now. Come on.

1035
01:06:46,213 --> 01:06:48,363
lt's gut-check time!

1036
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:53,246
This must be mine.

1037
01:06:55,573 --> 01:06:57,882
l'm going this way! l'm going left!

1038
01:06:58,373 --> 01:07:00,045
Never trust an Earthling!

1039
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:06,447
Get the girl!

1040
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:08,608
Come on!

1041
01:07:08,773 --> 01:07:09,967
l'm open!

1042
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,970
-That's mine!
-Not today!

1043
01:07:14,773 --> 01:07:16,445
Bring it on, dude.

1044
01:07:19,413 --> 01:07:20,562
You're mine!

1045
01:07:29,053 --> 01:07:30,088
l'm open!

1046
01:07:32,773 --> 01:07:33,888
Never mind.

1047
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:09,487
The Tunes win!

1048
01:08:14,693 --> 01:08:15,808
Nice pass.

1049
01:08:15,973 --> 01:08:17,964
Great stretch at the basket too.

1050
01:08:18,213 --> 01:08:21,171
You really got some skills.
You could play in the NBA.

1051
01:08:22,293 --> 01:08:25,012
Thanks, Mike.
l'll probably quote you on that.

1052
01:08:25,173 --> 01:08:28,210
But l'm going to take this opportunity
to retire from the game.

1053
01:08:28,293 --> 01:08:29,009
Come on.

1054
01:08:29,093 --> 01:08:32,608
No,
l'm going to retire right now and that's it.

1055
01:08:32,773 --> 01:08:35,003
l'm going to go out undefeated.

1056
01:08:35,173 --> 01:08:36,447
That's how it will be.

1057
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:39,001
-You go celebrate.
-Come with us.

1058
01:08:39,173 --> 01:08:43,803
l'd like to, but l have to ice down my
knees now. They're starting to go.

1059
01:08:43,973 --> 01:08:44,928
Good-bye.

1060
01:08:45,013 --> 01:08:46,048
See you.

1061
01:08:47,813 --> 01:08:48,609
You sure?

1062
01:08:48,693 --> 01:08:51,002
Yes. Definitely sure. Definitely.

1063
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:53,805
-Losers!
-Sorry.

1064
01:08:53,973 --> 01:08:55,565
-Choke artists!
-Sorry again.

1065
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:58,213
Wait till l get you back
on Moron Mountain.

1066
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:02,922
The party's over! Get in the spaceship.

1067
01:09:03,093 --> 01:09:04,606
Why do you take that?

1068
01:09:04,693 --> 01:09:07,002
Because he's bigger.

1069
01:09:07,173 --> 01:09:08,447
He's bigger?

1070
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:09,887
Than we used...

1071
01:09:10,053 --> 01:09:11,088
...to be.

1072
01:09:12,613 --> 01:09:14,012
What're you doing?

1073
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:17,172
-Wait! What are you doing? Wait!
-Come here.

1074
01:09:32,373 --> 01:09:34,364
Had it in you all the time.

1075
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:38,967
One thing. Pass me the ball, Bugs.

1076
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,203
Give my friends their talent back.

1077
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:43,564
Do we have to?

1078
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:46,201
lt's part of the deal. Touch the ball.

1079
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:51,447
Fair is fair.

1080
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:52,966
Touch it.

1081
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:01,405
That was so much fun.

1082
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:02,688
l feel so...

1083
01:10:02,773 --> 01:10:04,126
...insignificant.

1084
01:10:04,293 --> 01:10:05,885
My clothes don't fit.

1085
01:10:06,053 --> 01:10:07,168
What a trip!

1086
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,448
l'm up for another!

1087
01:10:08,533 --> 01:10:10,922
Can we ask you a favor, Mr. Bunny?

1088
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:13,164
We don't want to go back.

1089
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,403
-We hate it there.
-lt stinks.

1090
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:19,402
l was thinking, could we stay here?

1091
01:10:19,573 --> 01:10:21,165
Please!

1092
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:22,368
Oh, brother.

1093
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:25,172
l don't know if you guys
are looney enough.

1094
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:26,561
Looney enough?

1095
01:10:33,493 --> 01:10:35,290
Do you know what time it is?

1096
01:10:35,373 --> 01:10:38,570
Seven-fift-- Seven-fift--
Quarter past seven.

1097
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:41,008
You have a baseball game in 5 minutes!

1098
01:10:41,293 --> 01:10:43,204
Okay. Take this.

1099
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,208
ls it safe?

1100
01:10:45,293 --> 01:10:46,931
Yeah, put it in my bag.

1101
01:10:47,733 --> 01:10:49,007
Let's go.

1102
01:10:49,373 --> 01:10:51,284
l enjoyed playing with you.

1103
01:10:51,453 --> 01:10:53,091
You've got a lot of....

1104
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:57,843
Whatever it is, you got a lot of it.

1105
01:11:00,653 --> 01:11:01,688
Got to go.

1106
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:05,687
Stay out of trouble.

1107
01:11:05,773 --> 01:11:07,525
You know l will.

1108
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,446
Come here!

1109
01:11:16,413 --> 01:11:18,244
The delay is killing us.

1110
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:19,768
Where's Michael?

1111
01:11:19,853 --> 01:11:21,411
Where is Michael?

1112
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,643
He's not back from his other game.

1113
01:11:23,733 --> 01:11:24,802
What game?

1114
01:11:25,973 --> 01:11:27,326
What other game?

1115
01:12:00,253 --> 01:12:02,244
Ladies and gentlemen...

1116
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:06,486
...Michael Jordan!

1117
01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:24,648
Guys...

1118
01:12:24,813 --> 01:12:26,087
...we suck!

1119
01:12:26,973 --> 01:12:29,043
My grandmother plays better.

1120
01:12:29,213 --> 01:12:32,728
You guys are still tall.
l'm nothing now. Just a short guy.

1121
01:12:32,893 --> 01:12:33,769
You're right.

1122
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:36,003
That's the only thing you got right.

1123
01:12:39,453 --> 01:12:40,647
-Who's that?
-Who is it?

1124
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:41,688
l don't know.

1125
01:12:41,773 --> 01:12:43,365
You've been getting beaten.

1126
01:12:43,453 --> 01:12:44,488
lt's Mike.

1127
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:46,086
-What's up?
-Why're you here?

1128
01:12:46,173 --> 01:12:47,606
Don't be embarrassed.

1129
01:12:47,693 --> 01:12:49,046
Just face it.

1130
01:12:49,773 --> 01:12:50,808
You stink.

1131
01:12:50,893 --> 01:12:52,246
Lighten up.

1132
01:12:52,653 --> 01:12:53,608
l know.

1133
01:12:53,773 --> 01:12:56,571
You want your games back.
What games you had.

1134
01:12:56,733 --> 01:12:58,405
lt's hard enough as it is.

1135
01:12:58,493 --> 01:12:59,812
Give us a break.

1136
01:13:00,253 --> 01:13:01,925
l'm going to regret this.

1137
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:04,566
Give me the ball.

1138
01:13:10,813 --> 01:13:12,405
lt's like ''Star Trek.''

1139
01:13:13,773 --> 01:13:14,728
Touch it.

1140
01:13:14,813 --> 01:13:16,485
No way, Jose.

1141
01:13:16,813 --> 01:13:19,850
You want your talent back? Just touch it.

1142
01:13:21,053 --> 01:13:22,645
-l don't know.
-Don't touch it.

1143
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:27,204
You'll walk around with a bad game
for the rest of your career. Touch it.

1144
01:13:28,493 --> 01:13:29,767
Careful, Pat.

1145
01:13:31,933 --> 01:13:33,764
We've tried everything else.

1146
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:45,368
Come on.

1147
01:13:45,773 --> 01:13:46,808
Touch it.

1148
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:48,247
The rest of you.

1149
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,607
Just touch it.

1150
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:57,363
-What was that?
-l liked that.

1151
01:13:58,013 --> 01:13:59,526
l caught it!

1152
01:14:00,253 --> 01:14:02,209
Look at Mugsey handle the rock!

1153
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:03,891
l can handle it again!

1154
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,925
That's the old Mugs l know.

1155
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:07,685
Yeah, get height now!

1156
01:14:08,613 --> 01:14:10,569
lt gave me my powers back!

1157
01:14:11,053 --> 01:14:13,044
Let me show you something.

1158
01:14:14,173 --> 01:14:15,925
The Round-Mound is back!

1159
01:14:16,093 --> 01:14:17,651
Want to see something?

1160
01:14:19,693 --> 01:14:21,524
That felt good!

1161
01:14:23,813 --> 01:14:26,088
-l got it.
-You got it. Yeah, baby.

1162
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,089
Stay.

1163
01:14:28,253 --> 01:14:30,084
Play some 3-on-3 with us?

1164
01:14:30,813 --> 01:14:32,087
l don't think so.

1165
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:34,164
You going to work on your swing?

1166
01:14:34,253 --> 01:14:38,087
Leave the baseball player alone.
He doesn't play basketball now.

1167
01:14:38,253 --> 01:14:40,403
He probably doesn't have it anymore.

1168
01:14:41,213 --> 01:14:44,569
Do you hear them?
They don't think you can play the game.

1169
01:14:48,373 --> 01:14:50,204
There's one way to find out.

1170
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:57,012
The Chicago Bulls is
proud to welcome back...

1171
01:14:58,533 --> 01:15:00,444
