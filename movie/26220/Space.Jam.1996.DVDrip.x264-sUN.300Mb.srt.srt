300MB UNITED TEAM - sunmenghao

1
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:01,202
Michael?

2
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:07,133
What are you doing? lt's after 12.

3
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:09,131
Couldn't sleep, Pops.

4
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,853
Neither can we,
with the noise you're making.

5
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,447
Let's go inside.

6
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,372
Just one more shot?

7
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:18,602
All right.

8
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,048
Just one.

9
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:25,689
Good. Shoot it again.

10
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:32,212
Getting pretty good. Shoot till you miss.

11
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:36,085
You think if l can get good enough,
l can go to college?

12
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:41,691
lf you get good enough,
you can do anything you want.

13
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,843
l want to play at North Carolina.

14
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,809
That's a real fine school.

15
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:51,043
You can get a good education.

16
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:53,642
l want to play on a championship team.

17
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:56,683
Then l want to play in the NBA.

18
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,649
All right, let's slow down, son.

19
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:04,043
Shouldn't you get some sleep first?

20
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:05,931
Once l've done all that...

21
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,368
...l want to play baseball, like you.

22
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,763
Baseball. Yeah, now, that's a sport.

23
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,766
When you've done that...

24
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:15,048
...l suppose you're going to fly?

25
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,892
At this time...

26
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:46,168
...l've reached the pinnacle of my
basketball career and must retire.

27
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,848
The one good thing is that my
father had the opportunity...

28
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:52,208
...to see me play my last game.

29
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:53,567
That means a lot.

30
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,291
What'll you do now?

31
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:58,763
l've never really told anybody this,
except for one person.

32
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:02,087
l'm going to play professional baseball.

33
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:03,925
What are you going to play?

34
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:06,527
l don't know. As a kid, l was a pitcher.

35
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,685
l think outfield,
because it'll be hard for me to pitch.

36
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,609
Let's get out of here. This stinks.

37
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,690
Don't bring me again.

38
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:06,332
Don't bring me again.

39
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,051
Are you listening?

40
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:12,525
Did you hear him? Did you hear him?
That little brat is right.

41
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,082
l told you, if l've told you once...

42
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:19,292
...l told you a thousand, thousand,
thousand, thousand times!

43
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,489
We need new attractions!

44
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:23,649
New ones!

45
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:24,449
Get it?

46
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,125
Big, shiny new things.

47
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:27,442
Absolutely, sir.

48
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,091
Look at me and listen:

49
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,888
The customer is always right!

50
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:32,769
Right!

51
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,083
The customer is always right!

52
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,402
Exactly!

53
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:38,332
Always!

54
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:40,562
Right!

55
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,089
Okay, we need something.
We need something...

56
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,282
...nutty!

57
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,532
Something wacky.

58
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:50,523
Wacky!

59
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,047
We need something, something....

60
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:54,646
Looney? Oops!

61
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:56,246
Looney. Thank you!

62
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:57,522
Looney?

63
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:07,567
Yes! Looney!

64
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:09,892
Now you're talking!

65
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:12,089
Looney! Looney! That's it!

66
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,642
That's the word l was looking for!

67
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:17,008
Get the Looney Tunes.

68
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,492
Bring them here.

69
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:20,126
Sir, just noticing...

70
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,725
...they're from Earth.
What if they can't come?

71
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:27,449
What did you say?
What if they can't come?

72
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:29,848
Make them.

73
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:30,843
Cool.

74
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,366
Make them!

75
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:34,490
We're gonna get them!

76
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:46,605
Strike!

77
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:50,526
Looks good in that uniform.

78
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,843
Looks great. Can't teach that.

79
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,162
Can't teach it.

80
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:57,131
Thanks for autographing
that basketball for my kid.

81
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,726
l'm happy to do it.

82
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:00,167
Let's go!

83
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,764
Curve ball. Don't swing.

84
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,169
Don't...swing.

85
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,128
Ball!

86
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:23,562
Fastball, outside corner. Swing.

87
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:29,972
Strike!

88
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:31,807
That was your pitch.

89
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:33,372
l know, l missed it.

90
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,723
l'll get you another one.

91
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:40,042
Podolak!

92
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:41,442
Come here.

93
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:44,047
-l'm sorry, l didn't mean to--
-Come here!

94
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,808
Make sure that nobody bothers Michael.

95
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,088
l want him to be the happiest player.

96
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:53,968
Slider. Don't swing.

97
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,007
Strike three!

98
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,572
l told you not to!

99
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:02,649
l couldn't help it.

100
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,849
l know. Nice talking to you!

101
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,290
We're not worried.

102
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,652
Good cut.

103
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:24,043
That was a good-looking strikeout.

104
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:27,842
You look good when you strike out.
When l do, it looks nasty.

105
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:30,243
At least you look good. Good-looking.

106
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:32,971
Hi, Mr. Jordan.

107
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,246
l'm Stan Podolak.

108
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:40,967
Oh, jeez.

109
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,888
You okay?

110
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:48,004
That was a nasty fall.

111
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,008
l'm Stan Podolak, Mr. Jordan,
the Baron's new publicist.

112
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:56,930
l'm here to make your life easier.
Can l drive you somewhere?

113
00:10:57,013 --> 00:11:00,642
You want me to pick up your laundry,
baby-sit your kids?

114
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,373
l am here to personally guarantee...

115
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,093
...that no one will ever bother you.

116
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:16,487
What was that?

117
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:22,448
Hang on!

118
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:25,002
-Hanging on!
-Hanging on!

119
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:27,085
Are we there yet?

120
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:37,206
-Bombastic!
-Cool.

121
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:51,572
You irascible bunny!
Come back here, you screwy rodent!

122
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:56,046
l'll be with you in a second, folks,
after l finish with nature boy here.

123
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,364
All right, you pesky rabbit.

124
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,166
l've got you now!

125
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:10,246
One small step for moi....

126
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,003
One giant leap for Moron Mountain!

127
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,088
And one whopper headache for Elmer Fudd.

128
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:24,489
Diminutive, ain't they?

129
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,213
We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.

130
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,369
-Have you seen him?
-Where is he?

131
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:30,602
ls he around?

132
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,244
Bugs Bunny, Bugs Bunny.

133
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:37,485
Say, does he have great big long ears?

134
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,047
Like this?

135
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:41,965
Does he hop around...

136
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,327
...like this?

137
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:50,450
Does he say, ''What's up, doc?'' like this:

138
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:54,521
What's up, doc?

139
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,649
Nope! Never heard of him.

140
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,004
You know,
maybe there is no intelligent life...

141
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,163
...out in the universe after all.

142
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:11,733
Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune.

143
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:14,088
What do you think we are? Stupid?

144
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,164
Don't move a muscle.

145
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:20,205
Okay, bunny, gather up your Tune pals.

146
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,003
-We're taking you for a ride.
-Move it.

147
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:27,051
Totally. All right.
So, like, where are we going?

148
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:32,652
Are we there yet?

149
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,363
-Sorry it took so long.
-Don't worry about it.

150
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,683
That exit on 65 wasn't clearly marked.

151
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:39,844
-Hold up, right here.
-Here?

152
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:45,842
Thanks, Sherm.

153
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,208
-Appreciate it.
-lt's Stan, Mike.

154
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,888
You can call me Sherm if you want.

155
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:55,285
l follow your career and l think you're
the greatest athlete that's ever lived.

156
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,362
How do l get out?

157
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,011
The door doesn't work.

158
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,451
lt's a classic.

159
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:04,810
lt's a classic, but it's got
a few peccadillos. Hold on.

160
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,247
A few?

161
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,165
lt's smoking too.

162
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:12,052
Thanks for the ride.

163
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:16,326
This is nice. This is a nice house.

164
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,529
Beautiful. What is that, Colonial?

165
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:19,932
lt's a nice house.

166
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:22,243
lf you need help with the house....

167
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,051
l'm fine, thanks.

168
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:26,443
You gave me a ride. Thanks.

169
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:29,127
l'll drive tomorrow, so l don't need a ride.

170
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,366
But thanks, though.

171
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:32,852
Too conspicuous?

172
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:34,849
Yeah.

173
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,727
Thanks, though.

174
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,770
-Tomorrow!
-See you tomorrow.

175
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,850
Come on! No, not today!

176
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,729
Get off me! Your breath!

177
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,090
Mr. Jordan, are you okay?
Get off of him, Charles!

178
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:00,209
Bad dog! Git!

179
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:03,729
Pooch, stop it!
Get off of him before l cook you!

180
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,770
Come on, come on, baby.

181
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:13,162
Get out!

182
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:17,447
Good game.

183
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,212
Hey, Jeff, you okay?

184
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:29,131
-How was your game?
-l don't want to talk about it.

185
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:36,961
How are you?

186
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:40,925
You're covered with drool!

187
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,287
That's your dog.

188
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,211
What's wrong with Jeff?

189
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,370
He lost 32 points in his average.

190
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,442
ls that all?

191
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,252
So that puts him at .685 or something.

192
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:51,812
He's batting what?

193
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:55,168
Smells good in here. What you cooking?

194
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:56,368
Chicken.

195
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:58,047
Chicken and what?

196
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,168
Collard greens.

197
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,448
Good. l need a good meal tonight.

198
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,526
ls everything okay?

199
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:08,969
l stunk up the place.
Hope baseball was a good idea.

200
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,886
It was another career
day for Michael Jordan.

201
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,205
What're you watching?

202
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,212
He had 3 strikeouts.

203
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,807
ls this the only thing on TV?
What's up with this?

204
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,885
His batting average is .214,
which is his weight.

205
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,923
Get this guy a tennis racquet!

206
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:29,324
Did everyone get mad at you?

207
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:32,165
No. Worse.

208
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,686
They were nice about it.

209
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,331
I know golf is your sport.

210
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,005
But not here.

211
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:40,688
You should open your stance.
lt might make you more aggressive.

212
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:43,882
You think so? l'll remember that.

213
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,009
Watching this hurt me more than you.

214
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:49,449
Why are you watching this stuff?
lt's bad for you.

215
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:56,369
There.

216
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,082
Road Runner.

217
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,289
Stop this cartoon!

218
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:13,722
We've got an emergency Cartoon
Character Union Meeting to go to.

219
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:19,561
Hey, wait for me! Hold your horses!

220
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:28,285
Where'd they go?

221
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:36,001
Stop the music!

222
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:37,885
Top duck coming through!

223
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:41,887
Jeez! lt's getting so a guy can't
even get himself wet around here!

224
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:44,169
What's the big emergency?

225
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:48,129
These little guys would like to
make an announcement. Here.

226
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:52,808
You...

227
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:54,162
...all of you...

228
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,369
...are now our prisoners!

229
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:02,123
Oh, we're in big trouble now.

230
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:06,610
We are taking you to our
theme park in outer space.

231
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,802
No fooling.

232
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:09,486
You'll be our slaves.

233
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:12,923
And placed on display for the
amusement of our customers.

234
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,802
Oh, fear clutches my breast.

235
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:19,564
We ain't a-going...

236
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,406
...nowheres!

237
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:29,288
Not so fast, doc.

238
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,611
You just can't turn us into slaves.
That would be bad.

239
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:34,923
You must let us defend ourselves.

240
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:37,442
Oh, yeah? Who says?

241
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,326
Just a sec.

242
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,329
Read.

243
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:42,608
What's this?

244
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:45,969
''Give them a chance
to defend themselves.''

245
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:47,807
Do we have to?

246
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:49,247
lt's a rule.

247
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,369
Okay. lt is in the rule book.

248
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:52,767
Una momento!

249
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,605
We must confer.

250
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:02,203
All right, troops. lt is for us to
choose a battlefield that affords us--

251
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:04,322
l got it.

252
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,728
Yes, Private Porkster?

253
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,402
How about we challenge them to a...

254
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:11,247
...spelling bee?

255
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,448
Say...

256
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:15,366
...we could have a bowling tournament.

257
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,764
Suffering succotash!

258
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,645
What's wrong with you?

259
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:21,405
Let's get a ladder...

260
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,729
...wait till the old lady's gone...

261
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:26,361
...and grab that little bird!

262
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,962
Whoa! Take a deep breath, Sly!

263
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,847
Okay, let's analyze the competition.

264
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,368
Now what are we looking at here?

265
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:39,492
We got a small race of invading aliens....

266
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,201
Small arms! Short legs!

267
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:44,526
Not very fast.

268
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:46,052
Tiny little guys.

269
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:48,283
Can't jump high.

270
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,167
We challenge you to a basketball game.

271
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,724
Basketball it is!

272
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:01,407
Basketball!

273
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:04,241
What is basketball?

274
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,652
-What's that?
-Beats me.

275
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,007
We didn't have that in school.

276
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:07,969
Lights!

277
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,611
Pardon me! Sorry.

278
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:11,806
Down in front!

279
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:16,683
An exhilarating team sport currently
growing rapidly in popularity...

280
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,605
...is basketball.

281
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:23,170
Unlike football and baseball,
only 5 men can play on a team.

282
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:27,372
It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle
game that requires quick wits...

283
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,363
...and even faster reflexes.

284
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,088
Here's how it's done professionally.

285
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,801
The National Basketball Association...

286
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:38,846
...featuring the best players in the world.

287
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:41,243
The best players in the world!

288
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:42,163
The best!

289
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,483
Excuse me. Oh, so sorry.

290
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:04,722
Excuse me.

291
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:07,532
Get off my nose!

292
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,604
Quiet, they're looking!

293
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,444
lt's basketball!

294
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:13,729
Where?

295
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:15,326
Whoa! Now what?

296
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,004
-She's looking.
-Close it up.

297
00:21:22,093 --> 00:21:23,321
Tightly.

298
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,246
You poked me again.

299
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:27,888
Sweetheart?

300
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,964
l thought you'd get better seats.

301
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:34,444
-This is the best l could get.
-This guy's doing something weird.

302
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:37,451
Just let me watch the game.
Barkley is killing us.

303
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:40,045
Someone's killing someone!

304
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:41,771
No. Seriously?

305
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:43,201
A killer!

306
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:44,528
Let me see!

307
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,125
There! That's the killer!

308
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,161
He's big.

309
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:52,767
He's good.

310
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:54,925
He's mine!

311
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:56,288
Go get him!

312
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:11,162
Come on! Get back on defense!

313
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,403
Let's go! Get back on d!

314
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:19,966
What are you doing?

315
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:29,650
Time out! Call time out!

316
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,523
What's wrong with you?

317
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:33,888
Let him in.

318
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:35,042
Open up!

319
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,368
Open!

320
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:38,367
He did it.

321
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:41,771
l got it! l got his talent!

322
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:42,929
Super.

323
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:45,891
-Sit down, Chuck.
-Man, l'm fine! l am fine!

324
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,566
l played you too much.

325
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:49,609
-l'm not tired!
-Get the doctor.

326
00:22:59,173 --> 00:23:00,765
You all right?

327
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:01,922
You sure?

328
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:04,926
Come on, we're okay.

329
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:06,605
Come on, let's go.

330
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:14,363
Come on, Patrick. Showtime!

331
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:18,651
What's wrong with him?

332
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:28,962
In a shocking development, 5 NBA
players were put on the disabled list...

333
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:33,092
...in the last 24 hours, all suffering
from the same mysterious ailment...

334
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:35,813
...that affects the player's coordination.

335
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:38,009
l'll be home in a few days.

336
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:40,452
Put your mom on.

337
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:43,926
How you doing?

338
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:46,688
Watching TV?

339
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,611
What's going on?

340
00:23:51,773 --> 00:23:54,241
-You gonna be all right?
-I'm ready, Coach.

341
00:23:56,773 --> 00:23:59,003
Looks like l retired just in time.

342
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,648
l must go.

343
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,293
l'll call you later. Love you, bye.

344
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:06,442
lt's open!

345
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:08,126
lt's game time!

346
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:09,851
Lace up your Nikes.

347
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:13,210
Grab your Gatorade and we'll
get a Big Mac on the way.

348
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:15,648
Now we go to the Los Angeles Forum...

349
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:18,691
...where the Lakers are
refusing to take the court.

350
00:24:20,573 --> 00:24:21,847
Get dressed.

351
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:25,562
We got a game in 5 minutes!
We're talking a huge fine.

352
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,689
We can't go in the locker room.

353
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:31,089
You heard what happened to
Barkley and Ewing. There's germs.

354
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:34,210
Cedric, that was in New York,
3,000 miles away.

355
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,012
Bacteria travels faster
than the speed of light.

356
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:39,368
Like ''lnvasion of the Body Snatchers.''

357
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:41,162
All right.

358
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:42,402
Dress in the hallway.

359
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:52,083
Okay, okay, which one of you
maroons has ever played basketball?

360
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:53,727
l have, Coach.

361
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:57,244
And there's an important question
l must ask you.

362
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:05,169
What do you think?
l'm partial to purple and gold.

363
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:07,170
lt's better with my coloring.

364
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,205
Nice outfit, Daffy.

365
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:14,609
The little aliens say it's
their turn to use the court.

366
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:18,044
Sure, let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out.

367
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:21,091
Too bad you can't practice
getting taller, boys.

368
00:25:59,613 --> 00:26:00,887
Hey, little pig!

369
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:07,089
l wet myself.

370
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:12,407
Time to play a little basketball.

371
00:26:16,893 --> 00:26:19,771
These little pipsqueaks just
turned into superstars!

372
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,083
They're monsters!

373
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,404
Suffering succotash!

374
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:26,609
They're ''monstars''!

375
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:29,641
Bye-bye.

376
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,884
l think we might need some help.

377
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:38,764
175 yards.

378
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:41,841
Okay, little fella. You my friend?

379
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,448
Or my enemy?

380
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:46,082
You are my friend. You are my ally.

381
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,327
You are my associate,
my personal assistant.

382
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:52,412
You are my weapon. You are leaving.

383
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:56,847
-Great shot.
-Nice shot.

384
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:03,764
You can stop posing now.

385
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,209
Good try.

386
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,521
Not bad.

387
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:10,484
-Something for you to shoot at.
-Hit it good.

388
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:11,926
Do my best.

389
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:14,768
Good shot.

390
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:16,328
l know.

391
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:18,885
l must ask you something.

392
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:22,568
The NBA must face reality.
What's happening is serious.

393
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,367
They're going to need
new players with talent.

394
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:29,128
Skilled guys who never really
thought about a professional career.

395
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,412
Think l got a shot?

396
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,732
Come on, really?

397
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:37,002
Don't kid.

398
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:38,806
lt's a man's game.

399
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,763
-You can't play.
-What if l tried hard?

400
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,286
Keep it down.

401
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,691
lt's because l'm white.

402
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:47,923
No. Larry's white. So what?

403
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:50,653
Larry's not white. Larry's clear.

404
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:56,050
Get inside his ball!

405
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:59,444
You clowns can't beat that.

406
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:01,365
-My best shot ever.
-You haven't played long.

407
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:02,727
A Hall-of-Fame shot.

408
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:05,043
-Nice shot, Mr. Bird.
-Larry, please.

409
00:28:05,213 --> 00:28:06,407
Nice shot, Mr. Larry.

410
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:07,369
Nice shot.

411
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:08,772
You can do this.

412
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:11,608
Don't be nervous, you can do this.

413
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,492
You feel the NBA has to face reality,
don't you?

414
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,730
Look for some players where
they never looked before.

415
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:21,044
Just look at the ball.
Visualize where you want it to go.

416
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:23,521
Be the ball.

417
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,086
Get off the tee.

418
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:26,368
Can't jump.

419
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,842
Go on.

420
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:31,408
Close to the pin?

421
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,721
For dinner?

422
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:35,168
-Sounds good.
-l'll go close to the pin.

423
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,161
l'll have some.

424
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:40,768
Not bad.

425
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:42,442
Good shot.

426
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:43,928
Get down.

427
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:46,805
Look at that spin.

428
00:28:58,013 --> 00:28:59,002
Come on!

429
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,761
lt is alive!

430
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,369
My first hole in one.

431
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:14,165
Never seen one of these.

432
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:18,207
Nothing but the bottom of the cup.

433
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,046
-That's his ball too.
-Yeah, it's my ball.

434
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:23,010
Wait, let me get a picture!

435
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:24,572
You must smile.

436
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:27,486
Reach in for the ball and then smile, okay?

437
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:29,007
ls this good?

438
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:30,845
Just take the picture!

439
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,085
What kind of camera is that?

440
00:29:42,173 --> 00:29:43,970
Don't point it at me.

441
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:46,363
-l didn't do anything!
-Where'd he go?

442
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:10,169
Look out for that first step,
doc, it's a real lulu.

443
00:30:10,813 --> 00:30:11,848
Bugs Bunny?

444
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:14,003
You expected the Easter Bunny?

445
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,772
You're not real.

446
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:19,443
Not real? lf l weren't real, could l do this?

447
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,412
ls that Michael?

448
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,006
lt's Michael!

449
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,572
lt's Air Jordan.

450
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,286
Basketball!

451
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:32,886
l thought l saw....

452
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:36,408
l did. l did see Michael Jordan.

453
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,406
Pardon me, Mr. Jordan.

454
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:40,245
Can l have your auto--

455
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:42,645
Your John Hancock, please?

456
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,644
Let the doctor take a look.

457
00:30:47,253 --> 00:30:48,447
A little high.

458
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:50,761
Going down!

459
00:30:57,533 --> 00:31:00,570
So, what do you say we go for a little spin?

460
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,652
Let's see what we got inside here.

461
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:10,287
Say, ''Ahh.''

462
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:14,163
All right. He's okay!

463
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:17,366
What's going on here?

464
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:19,444
l thought you'd never ask.

465
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:23,766
These aliens from outer space want to
make us slaves in their theme park.

466
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:27,608
They're little. So we challenged
them to a basketball game.

467
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,411
Then, they ain't so little!

468
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:32,166
They're huge! We need to beat these guys.

469
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,011
They're talking about slavery!

470
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:37,802
They'll make us do stand-up,
the same jokes every night!

471
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:41,289
We'll be locked up like wild animals,
trotted out to perform...

472
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:45,332
...for a bunch of bug-eyed, fat-headed,
humor-challenged aliens!

473
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:47,768
What l'm trying to say is...

474
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:50,322
...we need your help!

475
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:52,725
l'm a baseball player now.

476
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:55,691
Right. And l'm a Shakespearean actor.

477
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:00,882
Mike?

478
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,283
Michael? lt's Stan.

479
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:04,647
Stan Podolak.

480
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:07,283
l need you to come out now, okay?

481
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:09,523
You got a baseball game tomorrow.

482
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:12,366
And I'd look pretty stupid
ifyou don't show up.

483
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:16,047
Think he's all right? l hate to leave him.

484
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:20,092
He's fine. l think he just had to
get away from that Stan character.

485
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:21,845
He's pathetic, isn't he?

486
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:26,492
l'll give us both twos. We weren't in
any kind of emotional state to putt.

487
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,132
l think that's fair.

488
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:32,652
lf Mike is gone, the NBA is
going to need some new people.

489
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:34,206
There's room at the top.

490
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:37,365
An exciting guy
who could even perform at half-time.

491
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:38,848
You know David Stern?

492
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:39,922
A phone call from you....

493
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:41,686
l want to help...

494
00:32:41,853 --> 00:32:44,970
...but l haven't played in a long time.
My timing's off.

495
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:46,281
We'll fix it.

496
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,404
Look at our facility.

497
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:50,325
We got hoops.

498
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,565
We got weights.

499
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:54,928
We've got balls.

500
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,566
You sure do. This place is a mess.

501
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:00,531
You're worried about a mess?

502
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:03,969
There's nothing here a little
spit shine wouldn't fix.

503
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:06,047
Spit shine!

504
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:25,731
Lemony-fresh.

505
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:27,412
You guys are nuts.

506
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:30,485
Correction: We're Looney Tunes.

507
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:35,124
And as such are the exclusive property
and trademark of Warner Bros. lnc.

508
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:45,481
l'm here!

509
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:48,087
Me too!

510
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:50,852
That hurt.

511
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:54,486
Who are they?

512
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:58,043
Remember the tiny aliens l told you about?

513
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:03,689
You've heard of the Dream Team?
We're the Mean Team, wussieman!

514
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:05,805
Wussieman.

515
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:07,565
We're the Monstars.

516
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:09,086
M-o-n-....

517
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:11,085
Let's see what you got...

518
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:12,208
...chump!

519
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:14,684
l don't play basketball anymore.

520
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:17,162
''l don't play basketball anymore.''

521
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,443
Maybe you're chicken.

522
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:24,201
l say, l resemble that remark.

523
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:26,011
You calling me chicken?

524
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:27,762
Come here.

525
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:33,085
Here you go. Take him!

526
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:34,926
Watch the footwork.

527
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:36,526
Can you believe it?

528
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:39,644
Get out of the way!

529
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:44,848
Everybody.

530
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,642
Look at your hero now.

531
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:53,284
You guys are making a mistake.

532
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:56,053
You're all washed up, baldy!

533
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,802
Baldy?

534
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,406
He is not washed up!

535
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:01,563
-Michael's the greatest!
-Shut up!

536
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:07,644
My poor little cranium.

537
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:08,848
You okay?

538
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:10,765
Yeah, are you okay?

539
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:12,289
Whoops!

540
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:14,841
You're not scared of them...

541
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:16,368
...are you?

542
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:26,924
Let's play some basketball.

543
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:49,128
You're...!

544
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,331
You're Charles Barkley.

545
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,531
Girls! Come on over! Hurry up! Hurry!

546
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:57,923
Look! lt's Charles Barkley!

547
00:35:58,093 --> 00:35:59,208
Can l play?

548
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,245
You're not Charles Barkley.

549
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,403
Just a wanna-be who looks like him.

550
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,325
Sorry.

551
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:31,608
Break out.

552
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:34,321
You shouldn't even be here! Be gone!

553
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,643
Wanna-be! Be gone!

554
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:38,806
Just a few more tests.

555
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:42,886
Electrolyte levels,
glucose, CBCs, RBCs, etc.

556
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,603
And we've scheduled a stress test...

557
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:49,368
...and neurological battery
to include EEG and....

558
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:51,524
And this girl...

559
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:54,802
...five feet nothing, blocked my shot.

560
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:57,363
When did you first have this dream?

561
00:36:57,613 --> 00:37:00,081
lt wasn't a dream! lt really happened!

562
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:04,726
lt climbed up my back...

563
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:06,405
...and into my brain.

564
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,565
Are there other areas...

565
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,485
...besides basketball...

566
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:12,564
...where you find yourself...

567
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:15,125
...unable to perform?

568
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:18,729
No!

569
00:37:18,893 --> 00:37:20,008
Just asking.

570
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:27,205
l've been MRl'd, EKG'd,
x-rayed, laser beamed....

571
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:29,284
l'll never swear again.

572
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,444
l'll never get another technical.

573
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:33,046
l'll never trash-talk.

574
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:36,011
l've got other skills.
l could go work on the farm.

575
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:36,809
Really?

576
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:40,249
Or maybe l could go back to
the jungle and be a missionary.

577
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:43,291
What are you saying?
That l'm trying to disobey my mama?

578
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,125
You said that, not me.

579
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:46,408
l love her.

580
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:48,484
Still can't find anything wrong!

581
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:50,166
Maybe nothing's wrong!

582
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,483
Maybe it's just in our head.

583
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:54,962
We're fine. lt's psychosomatic.

584
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:57,044
Or has to do with the moon.

585
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:01,044
l'll never date Madonna again.

586
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:06,726
What are you doing?

587
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:09,366
l'm fixing a divot.

588
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:13,524
He's fixing a divot!

589
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:45,053
Has anyone here ever played basketball?

590
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:46,648
l have.

591
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:49,525
l'd like to try out.

592
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:53,363
Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.

593
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,046
Lola?

594
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,202
Hello!

595
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:59,682
My name's Bugs.

596
00:39:00,413 --> 00:39:02,563
You want to play one-on-one, doll?

597
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:03,768
''Doll''?

598
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:06,405
On the court, Bugs.

599
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,964
She's hot!

600
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:14,647
Ready?

601
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:18,486
l got it! l got it!

602
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,524
That girl's got some skills.

603
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:30,326
Don't ever call me...

604
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,846
...''doll.''

605
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:34,247
Check!

606
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:38,484
Nice playing with you.

607
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:40,647
Very smooth.

608
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:43,202
She's obviously nuts about me.

609
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:44,442
Obviously.

610
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:45,688
Mais oui.

611
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,206
Where's the ball?

612
00:39:48,573 --> 00:39:50,245
Let's do some drills.

613
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:57,603
Can anyone lend me some sneakers?

614
00:39:58,413 --> 00:39:59,846
Sneakers?

615
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,169
Sorry.

616
00:40:04,253 --> 00:40:06,813
Someone must get my gear
from my house.

617
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:08,247
Your house?

618
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:10,324
ln 3-D land?

619
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,006
Whatever you do...

620
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:14,643
...remember my North Carolina shorts.

621
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:17,122
Your shorts? From college?

622
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,365
l wore them under my Chicago Bulls
uniform every game.

623
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:24,242
l washed them after every game!

624
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:26,007
l did!

625
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:30,242
The view back here stinks.

626
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,010
We're in front of his house.

627
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:35,845
l knew that!

628
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,246
Let's go in this way.

629
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,802
l say, let's go in that way!

630
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,923
He just never learns!

631
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:47,845
Let me see.

632
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:50,243
l must be very, very...

633
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,926
...close.

634
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,208
Mother!

635
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,167
Nice digs.

636
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,852
Well, well. l wonder who that could be.

637
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:13,133
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

638
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:16,324
Everyone's sleeping!

639
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:17,608
l knew that.

640
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:21,129
Come on, we must find
Michael's basketball stuff.

641
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,484
Nope. Nothing in here.

642
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:26,488
Nope.

643
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,723
But a very nice dinette set.

644
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:30,487
Not here.

645
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:33,046
Let's look upstairs.

646
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:35,203
Yes, Oh, Fearless Leader.

647
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:38,321
So, he needs his special underwear.

648
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:42,043
Sorry.

649
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:44,129
You think she's got enough toys?

650
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,131
Speaking of toys,
you know all those mugs and...

651
00:41:47,293 --> 00:41:49,682
...lunch boxes with our pictures on them?

652
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:52,244
You ever see any money from it?

653
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,931
-Not a cent.
-Me neither.

654
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:56,567
lt's a shame.

655
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:59,293
We need a new agent.
We're getting screwed.

656
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:01,446
We've found the trophy room.

657
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:03,444
Spread out and search the place.

658
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:05,125
Yes, sahib.

659
00:42:05,293 --> 00:42:06,328
Oh, brother.

660
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:08,563
Here l am, in the peak of my form...

661
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:12,009
...playing second banana to
some sort of harebrain....

662
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,085
This could be useful.

663
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,085
lf this were a union job....

664
00:42:17,173 --> 00:42:18,925
That's very nice.

665
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,883
-l could use this.
-One of his shoes.

666
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:28,285
Where is the other shoe?

667
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:31,849
Where are you?

668
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:33,488
Eureka!

669
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:36,490
Come to Papa.

670
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:42,611
What a fuzz-foot. You are so clumsy.

671
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:44,768
Catch.

672
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,043
Thanks.

673
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:51,251
Time to go.

674
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:53,443
Did we get everything?

675
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:55,685
The shorts!

676
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,607
ln there?

677
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:00,170
Okay, l'll check.

678
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,403
l found the shorts.

679
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:12,444
The pain!

680
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:14,486
l'm right behind you.

681
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:16,211
That's not reassuring.

682
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,402
Nice puppy.

683
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:18,688
Want a bone?

684
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:20,767
No dice.

685
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:22,685
How about a nice ham?

686
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,445
Can't we talk this over?

687
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:26,365
Down, Beethoven.

688
00:43:26,693 --> 00:43:28,285
The kids are here.

689
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:31,607
Give it.

690
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:36,369
Here.

691
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,092
Thanks, kid.

692
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,291
Bad dog!

693
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:46,045
That is the last time l'm ever
working with dogs or children.

694
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:48,492
Where you going?

695
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:52,965
You see, the Looney Tunes have a
big basketball game coming up and...

696
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:55,243
-...your dad's playing.
-All right!

697
00:43:55,693 --> 00:43:57,968
Yeah! But don't tell anybody!

698
00:44:13,773 --> 00:44:14,967
l see aliens.

699
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,413
Little aliens from outer space.

700
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:22,086
They forced their way inside your bodies.

701
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:24,972
They need your talent to win a...

702
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,488
...basketball game against...

703
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,246
...Bugs Bunny.

704
00:44:29,773 --> 00:44:32,162
l also see Michael Jordan...

705
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:35,650
...being sucked down a golf hole...

706
00:44:35,893 --> 00:44:37,406
...by furry creatures.

707
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:39,165
That's it. We're going.

708
00:44:39,253 --> 00:44:40,481
We're leaving.

709
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:42,046
Let's try acupuncture.

710
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,327
Good idea.

711
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:46,442
This is it! This is it!

712
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:48,643
l don't know where you are...

713
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:53,085
...but you obviously enjoy being
there more than being with me!

714
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:56,211
You better hope this Jordan
character still can play.

715
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:58,524
You and me both, brother.

716
00:44:58,693 --> 00:45:01,253
Listen, how is this for a new team name:

717
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,052
The Ducks.

718
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,209
Please!

719
00:45:04,293 --> 00:45:07,808
What kind of Mickey Mouse
organization would name a team that?

720
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,687
So sue me. lt's just a suggestion.

721
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:16,406
You're doing it!

722
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:18,006
You're becoming mighty!

723
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,048
Go!

724
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:20,726
No pain, no gain.

725
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,367
Guys?

726
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:32,045
Look who's finally ready to play!

727
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:40,484
Let's see if l remember how.

728
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,724
ls it really you?

729
00:46:17,453 --> 00:46:19,648
Thank God you're all right!

730
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:21,963
l was so worried!

731
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:24,448
Come on, Stan. Don't hug me, please.

732
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:25,369
Sorry.

733
00:46:25,453 --> 00:46:28,684
-Why are you here?
-l must take you back for practice.

734
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:32,010
l can't. l'm helping my friends
in their basketball game.

735
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:38,763
Your friends are cartoon characters.

736
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:41,447
Yeah. So?

737
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:43,606
lt doesn't bother me.

738
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:46,366
Let me help? Let me help! l can help!

739
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:47,966
What can you do?

740
00:46:48,493 --> 00:46:50,370
l may not be tall, but...

741
00:46:50,893 --> 00:46:51,928
...l'm slow.

742
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:53,446
And large.

743
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:54,768
And a dork!

744
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,809
l'll do anything! Anything!

745
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:57,968
Anything?

746
00:46:58,053 --> 00:46:59,088
Anything.

747
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:02,883
Come here. Come here for a second.

748
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:04,966
Sit right here.

749
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,006
No problem.

750
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:09,733
All right! All right, let's go, team!

751
00:47:11,013 --> 00:47:13,732
lf someone gets injured,
we could see a lot of minutes.

752
00:47:13,813 --> 00:47:16,008
l'm a cheerleader.

753
00:47:33,493 --> 00:47:35,961
Mr. Commissioner, the place is sealed off.

754
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,047
Quiet!

755
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:44,092
Listen. After meeting with team owners...

756
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:46,813
...l decided that until we can guarantee...

757
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:49,123
...the health of our players...

758
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:52,649
...there will be no more
basketball this season.

759
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:32,283
Just get out of my way.

760
00:48:39,013 --> 00:48:39,923
Ready?

761
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:42,128
Let's go!

762
00:48:47,493 --> 00:48:49,484
Are these the best seats?

763
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:50,688
Like them!

764
00:48:51,573 --> 00:48:54,371
Can see everything from here! Very good!

765
00:49:01,093 --> 00:49:02,526
Ready to go?

766
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:04,086
Yeah, sure.

767
00:49:04,253 --> 00:49:05,208
Riot!

768
00:49:07,213 --> 00:49:10,091
Ladies and gentlemen...

769
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:13,212
...the starting lineup for...

770
00:49:13,373 --> 00:49:15,443
...the Tune Squad!

771
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,803
Standing 2 foot 4...

772
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:21,851
...The Wonder From Down Under...

773
00:49:22,013 --> 00:49:23,844
...the Tazmanian Devil!

774
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:30,648
At small forward...

775
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:33,930
...standing a scintillating 3 foot 2...

776
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:36,245
...The Heartthrob of the Hoops...

777
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,527
...Lola Bunny!

778
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:44,326
At power forward...

779
00:49:44,493 --> 00:49:47,849
...The Quackster of the Courts: Daffy Duck!

780
00:49:48,013 --> 00:49:49,605
Thank you! Thank you!

781
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,006
Very funny.

782
00:49:54,173 --> 00:49:56,323
Let's all laugh at the duck.

783
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,404
And at point guard...

784
00:49:58,573 --> 00:50:02,407
...standing 3 foot 3,

785
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,042
...co-captain of the Tune Squad...

786
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:07,169
...The Doctor of Delight:

787
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:09,285
Bugs Bunny!

788
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,205
Thank you! Thank you!

789
00:50:13,453 --> 00:50:15,125
And now...

790
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:18,012
...the player-coach of the Tune Squad...

791
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:21,690
...at 6 foot 6, from North Carolina...

792
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:24,003
...His Royal Airness:

793
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:25,891
Michael Jordan!

794
00:50:31,053 --> 00:50:32,168
Who?

795
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,766
ls he a Looney Tune?

796
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:35,688
Perhaps.

797
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:40,009
Ready?

798
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:41,606

799
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:43,923
They'll wish they never were born!

800
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:46,402
Guys, let's just go out and have fun.

801
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:49,453
The challengers for the Ultimate Game...

802
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,893
...all the way from Moron Mountain:

803
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:55,644
The Monstars!

804
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:05,091
Go Monstars! Go Monstars!
Go Monstars!

805
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:15,162
What are you looking at?

806
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:24,091
Cool shoes.

807
00:51:28,093 --> 00:51:29,003
Ready?

808
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:37,047
l got it! l got the ball!

809
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:48,251
Way to go!
Did you see the moves on that one?

810
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:52,211
Come on. Show me something!

811
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,168
The duck!

812
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:05,572
Oh, my!

813
00:52:05,853 --> 00:52:07,809
She was wide open.

814
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:19,125
Watch the screen!

815
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:20,442
Watch out!

816
00:52:21,413 --> 00:52:22,528
Get him!

817
00:52:27,493 --> 00:52:29,324
How did he do that?

818
00:52:30,053 --> 00:52:31,964
Nice shot, Mr. J.

819
00:52:32,133 --> 00:52:33,566
Let's play defense.

820
00:52:35,173 --> 00:52:36,686
Way to go!

821
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,047
Air J!

822
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:41,408

Feed me!

824
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:43,488

825
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:45,086
Feed me!

826
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:51,001
-Bad old putty tat!
-l'll take that.

827
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:53,691
Don't try this at home!

828
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:57,724
''l wish l was in the land of--''

829
00:52:57,893 --> 00:52:59,485
Going somewhere?

830
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:01,245
May l remind you, sir...

831
00:53:01,413 --> 00:53:04,485
...that physical violence is
patently against the rules!

832
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:09,292
Did you order Original Recipe
or Extra Crispy?

833
00:53:12,853 --> 00:53:13,888
Let's go.

834
00:53:13,973 --> 00:53:14,769
Me?

835
00:53:14,933 --> 00:53:16,685
l'm ready. l can do this.

836
00:53:16,853 --> 00:53:18,286
You picked the mouse?

837
00:53:18,373 --> 00:53:21,331
l love basketball. l always have. Do you?

838
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:22,846
l bet you're good.

839
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:25,243
l'm small, but l try hard to be good.

840
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:27,085
l always try hard.

841
00:53:27,253 --> 00:53:29,164
My mom says, ''Try your best--''

842
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:34,045
Try to get by me, doll.

843
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:35,727
''Doll''?

844
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:42,445
Don't ever call me...

845
00:53:42,613 --> 00:53:43,648
...''doll.''

846
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:45,132
Nice shot.

847
00:53:46,613 --> 00:53:49,571
There's the defense boy. l got you.

848
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:51,008
91 1 !

849
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:54,046
Pie? Pork chop?

850
00:53:54,293 --> 00:53:55,646
Sorbet, perhaps?

851
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,686
Half-time.

852
00:54:14,693 --> 00:54:16,126
Holy Putty Tat!

853
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:19,928
We're better than them.

854
00:54:20,253 --> 00:54:21,891
We got them.

855
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:24,123
Moron Mountain, here we come.

856
00:54:24,453 --> 00:54:26,284
We're going to be slaves.

857
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:28,728
There's a whole other half to play.

858
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,445
lt's the boss.

859
00:54:45,173 --> 00:54:47,641
Hello, Mr. Swackhammer!

860
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:48,848
All right.

861
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:52,689
Not bad for the first half.
But we must keep this up.

862
00:54:52,853 --> 00:54:53,968
No problem.

863
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:56,363
We stole talent from the NBA players!

864
00:54:56,773 --> 00:54:58,525
From the NBA!

865
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:01,088
Shut up!

866
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,844
l smell something.

867
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:08,285
We've been playing hard.

868
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,683
Not you, you idiot!

869
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:14,445
lt's coming from over here.

870
00:55:15,173 --> 00:55:16,322
That locker.

871
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:20,288
Look!

872
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:23,163
lt's the chubby boy!

873
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:25,532
lt smells like a...

874
00:55:25,813 --> 00:55:27,326
...spy!

875
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:33,090
You guys need a publicist?
l can make you big.

876
00:55:33,653 --> 00:55:35,883
-l know we're down.
-Let's hear the story.

877
00:55:35,973 --> 00:55:37,565
l've been here before.

878
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:39,485
We can still win this.

879
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:41,848
lt's not over. We must come together.

880
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:43,810
We must believe in ourselves.

881
00:55:44,293 --> 00:55:45,612
That'll help us.

882
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:51,724
Looks like Stan had a close
encounter with a bug-zapper.

883
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:54,285
The Monstars!

884
00:55:54,453 --> 00:55:55,647
The Monstars!

885
00:55:59,413 --> 00:56:00,687
That must hurt.

886
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:03,407
The Monstars!

887
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:05,488
The Monstars...

888
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:08,371
...stole the talent from the NBA players.

889
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:14,042
So that's what happened to them.

890
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:17,491
l think we should qui-- qui-- forfeit.

891
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:22,285
Listen, l didn't get dragged down
here to lose to ugly Monstars.

892
00:56:22,453 --> 00:56:25,525
l ain't going out like that.
We're letting them push us!

893
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:30,288
We must fight back!
We must get right in their faces!

894
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:32,369
Well?

895
00:56:33,813 --> 00:56:35,405
Are you with me or not?

896
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:42,843
Finished? Great speech and all.

897
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:46,688
You had them riveted.
But didn't you forget something?

898
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:49,643
Your secret stuff!

899
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:00,125
Nice deltoids!

900
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:01,408
Play along.

901
00:57:03,093 --> 00:57:04,606
Stop hogging it.

902
00:57:04,773 --> 00:57:06,092
We're teammates!

903
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:08,405
Secret stuff?

904
00:57:08,613 --> 00:57:12,447
Secret stuff? You wouldn't
hold out on us, would you?

905
00:57:12,613 --> 00:57:13,409
No.

906
00:57:13,493 --> 00:57:17,566
l didn't think you needed it.
You're so tough. You're competitive.

907
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:20,531
We're also chicken. We need it bad.

908
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,611
-l'd like some of that.
-Could l have a sip, please?

909
00:57:24,693 --> 00:57:27,810
This goes against everything
l learned in health class.

910
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:29,727
Do you want to win?

911
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,246
Bottoms up.

912
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:33,968
Yummy.

913
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:37,330
How about we go out
and kick some alien butt?

914
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:39,006
How about it? Ready?

915
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:00,287
Open!

916
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:03,087
Coming through!

917
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:09,286
Special delivery!

918
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:22,484
Nice kaboom.

919
00:58:38,493 --> 00:58:40,290
Let's teach them a lesson.

920
00:58:45,733 --> 00:58:46,802
Nice butt!

921
00:58:55,253 --> 00:58:56,527
Going up!

922
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:00,367
Slammy!

923
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:05,888
Hello! A little surprise for you, my friends.

924
00:59:10,773 --> 00:59:11,808
2 points.

925
00:59:21,373 --> 00:59:23,125
This will be good.

926
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:36,527
Okay, birdie!

927
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,606
Time out!

928
00:59:58,973 --> 01:00:01,771
Shut up, get away from me. Powwow!

929
01:00:02,053 --> 01:00:05,090
We're right back in this game.
Let's play tough defense.

930
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:07,206
Why didn't you get him?

931
01:00:07,293 --> 01:00:09,363
He's a baseball player.

932
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:10,602
A baseball player.

933
01:00:10,693 --> 01:00:13,048
Looks like a basketball player to me.

934
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:14,851
Me too.

935
01:00:15,013 --> 01:00:17,288
He's the one l want for Moron Mountain.

936
01:00:20,093 --> 01:00:22,004
Are you talking to me?

937
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:25,405
Yeah, l am. You want a piece of me?
Come and get it!

938
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:30,765
What do you have in mind?

939
01:00:31,813 --> 01:00:33,769
What about we raise the stakes?

940
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,412
lnteresting.

941
01:00:37,693 --> 01:00:40,685
lf we win, you give the NBA
players their talent back.

942
01:00:40,773 --> 01:00:42,445
But what if we win?

943
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:45,082
lf you win?

944
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,243
You get me.

945
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,402
Good deal.

946
01:00:48,573 --> 01:00:50,689
Doc, you think that's a good idea?

947
01:00:53,813 --> 01:00:56,088
You'll be our star attraction.

948
01:00:57,213 --> 01:00:59,932
You'll sign autographs all day long.

949
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:03,767
And play one-on-one with
the paying customers.

950
01:01:06,453 --> 01:01:07,602
And lose.

951
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:12,531
Do we have a deal?

952
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:17,089
Deal.

953
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:25,963
l don't think you should do this.

954
01:01:26,133 --> 01:01:27,805
l have faith in my team.

955
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:30,688
Crush them!

956
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:34,330
Defeating time, boys.

957
01:01:41,173 --> 01:01:42,401
Good-bye!

958
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:50,966
Fore!

959
01:01:56,373 --> 01:01:59,365
But, Mommy,
l don't want to go to school today.

960
01:02:00,573 --> 01:02:04,202
l want to stay home
and bake cookies with you.

961
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:08,288
l'm open!

962
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:09,928
Heads up!

963
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:11,248
Belly flop!

964
01:02:14,653 --> 01:02:15,608
Oh, my!

965
01:02:18,453 --> 01:02:20,364
ls this your man?

966
01:02:21,053 --> 01:02:22,088
You okay?

967
01:02:22,653 --> 01:02:24,723
Me? Oh, yeah. l'm fine.

968
01:02:24,893 --> 01:02:26,645
Are you okay?

969
01:02:28,093 --> 01:02:28,969
Thank you.

970
01:02:29,053 --> 01:02:30,805
lt was nothing.

971
01:02:31,253 --> 01:02:34,928
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

972
01:02:39,573 --> 01:02:40,688
Time out.

973
01:02:43,933 --> 01:02:46,652
l could have been a contender!

974
01:02:46,813 --> 01:02:48,724
The Monstars! The Monstars!

975
01:02:48,893 --> 01:02:50,804
l could have had a V-8!

976
01:03:08,253 --> 01:03:09,971
We need a fifth player.

977
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:14,451
You got any more secret stuff?
l think it's starting to wear off.

978
01:03:14,613 --> 01:03:16,729
lt didn't wear off. lt was water.

979
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,885
You guys had the ''special stuff''
inside you all along.

980
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,647
Yeah, l knew that. But you got any more?

981
01:03:24,373 --> 01:03:25,806
Can l have some?

982
01:03:27,573 --> 01:03:29,165
-Stan?
-Me?

983
01:03:30,493 --> 01:03:31,687
You're center.

984
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:33,726
Just guard the big guy.

985
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:36,088
Guard him? l'll smother him!

986
01:03:36,253 --> 01:03:40,212
l'll be all over him like a cheap suit!
l'll be on him like stink on rice!

987
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:41,692
He's going down!

988
01:03:48,253 --> 01:03:49,129
Over here!

989
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:50,282
Over here!

990
01:03:50,453 --> 01:03:51,488
l'm open!

991
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:04,248
Nice shot!

992
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:06,643
Big man, ain't he?

993
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:13,931
Let's get him out of here!

994
01:04:36,213 --> 01:04:37,692
Oh, my!

995
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,732
How'd he do that?

996
01:04:45,813 --> 01:04:47,166
Anyone can do that.

997
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:48,402
Even you.

998
01:04:48,613 --> 01:04:49,887
Watch this.

999
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:53,891
No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land.

1000
01:04:57,253 --> 01:05:00,450
10 seconds to go?
Thanks for telling me, doc.

1001
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:03,411
l hate to be the bearer of bad news,
Your Airness...

1002
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:08,123
...but if you don't find a fifth player,
your team will forfeit the game.

1003
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:09,289
Forfeit?

1004
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:11,011
Precisely, Sir Altitude.

1005
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,164
No way. We'll find someone.

1006
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:21,447
l didn't know Dan Ackroyd
was in this picture!

1007
01:05:23,773 --> 01:05:26,207
Perhaps l could be of some assistance?

1008
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,925
That's our fifth guy.

1009
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:31,973
Now you get to live your dream. Let's go.

1010
01:05:33,373 --> 01:05:36,126
-We need to score 2 points.
-Here's how l see it.

1011
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:40,332
You kick it to the girl
bunny down in the post.

1012
01:05:40,413 --> 01:05:41,892
You dish it to Bugs.

1013
01:05:42,173 --> 01:05:45,210
You swing it to Mike. You go to the hole.

1014
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:47,364
-And dominate!
-We're on defense!

1015
01:05:49,213 --> 01:05:50,407
l don't play defense.

1016
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:51,209
Typical.

1017
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:53,409
You must listen to Mike on this.

1018
01:05:53,573 --> 01:05:57,202
Someone steal the ball,
get it to me and l'll score.

1019
01:05:57,973 --> 01:05:59,691
Don't lose that confidence!

1020
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:02,163
Paws and wings in here! Okay!

1021
01:06:08,213 --> 01:06:09,805
This is why l was born.

1022
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,646
l thrive on pressure.

1023
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:13,407
Excuse me, sorry.

1024
01:06:13,493 --> 01:06:15,643
Easy on the trousers, Daf.

1025
01:06:15,813 --> 01:06:19,567
Pardon me. Mr. Murray,
something's really been bugging me.

1026
01:06:19,733 --> 01:06:21,724
Just how did you get here?

1027
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:26,210
Producer's a friend of mine.
Had a teamster drop me off.

1028
01:06:27,813 --> 01:06:29,246
That's how it goes.

1029
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:31,644
You see this chunky fellow?

1030
01:06:37,653 --> 01:06:38,927
That's good!

1031
01:06:39,093 --> 01:06:40,572
Let's do it!

1032
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:41,968
Play fair.

1033
01:06:43,893 --> 01:06:45,611
Don't choke now. Come on.

1034
01:06:45,813 --> 01:06:47,963
lt's gut-check time!

1035
01:06:51,413 --> 01:06:52,846
This must be mine.

1036
01:06:55,173 --> 01:06:57,482
l'm going this way! l'm going left!

1037
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,645
Never trust an Earthling!

1038
01:07:04,773 --> 01:07:06,047
Get the girl!

1039
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:08,208
Come on!

1040
01:07:08,373 --> 01:07:09,567
l'm open!

1041
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,570
-That's mine!
-Not today!

1042
01:07:14,373 --> 01:07:16,045
Bring it on, dude.

1043
01:07:19,013 --> 01:07:20,162
You're mine!

1044
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:29,688
l'm open!

1045
01:07:32,373 --> 01:07:33,488
Never mind.

1046
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:09,087
The Tunes win!

1047
01:08:14,293 --> 01:08:15,408
Nice pass.

1048
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:17,564
Great stretch at the basket too.

1049
01:08:17,813 --> 01:08:20,771
You really got some skills.
You could play in the NBA.

1050
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:24,612
Thanks, Mike.
l'll probably quote you on that.

1051
01:08:24,773 --> 01:08:27,810
But l'm going to take this opportunity
to retire from the game.

1052
01:08:27,893 --> 01:08:28,609
Come on.

1053
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:32,208
No,
l'm going to retire right now and that's it.

1054
01:08:32,373 --> 01:08:34,603
l'm going to go out undefeated.

1055
01:08:34,773 --> 01:08:36,047
That's how it will be.

1056
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:38,601
-You go celebrate.
-Come with us.

1057
01:08:38,773 --> 01:08:43,403
l'd like to, but l have to ice down my
knees now. They're starting to go.

1058
01:08:43,573 --> 01:08:44,528
Good-bye.

1059
01:08:44,613 --> 01:08:45,648
See you.

1060
01:08:47,413 --> 01:08:48,209
You sure?

1061
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:50,602
Yes. Definitely sure. Definitely.

1062
01:08:51,813 --> 01:08:53,405
-Losers!
-Sorry.

1063
01:08:53,573 --> 01:08:55,165
-Choke artists!
-Sorry again.

1064
01:08:55,253 --> 01:08:57,813
Wait till l get you back
on Moron Mountain.

1065
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:02,522
The party's over! Get in the spaceship.

1066
01:09:02,693 --> 01:09:04,206
Why do you take that?

1067
01:09:04,293 --> 01:09:06,602
Because he's bigger.

1068
01:09:06,773 --> 01:09:08,047
He's bigger?

1069
01:09:08,213 --> 01:09:09,487
Than we used...

1070
01:09:09,653 --> 01:09:10,688
...to be.

1071
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:13,612
What're you doing?

1072
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:16,772
-Wait! What are you doing? Wait!
-Come here.

1073
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:33,964
Had it in you all the time.

1074
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:38,567
One thing. Pass me the ball, Bugs.

1075
01:09:38,733 --> 01:09:40,803
Give my friends their talent back.

1076
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:43,164
Do we have to?

1077
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:45,801
lt's part of the deal. Touch the ball.

1078
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,047
Fair is fair.

1079
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:52,566
Touch it.

1080
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:01,005
That was so much fun.

1081
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:02,288
l feel so...

1082
01:10:02,373 --> 01:10:03,726
...insignificant.

1083
01:10:03,893 --> 01:10:05,485
My clothes don't fit.

1084
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:06,768
What a trip!

1085
01:10:06,933 --> 01:10:08,048
l'm up for another!

1086
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:10,522
Can we ask you a favor, Mr. Bunny?

1087
01:10:10,853 --> 01:10:12,764
We don't want to go back.

1088
01:10:12,933 --> 01:10:15,003
-We hate it there.
-lt stinks.

1089
01:10:16,693 --> 01:10:19,002
l was thinking, could we stay here?

1090
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,765
Please!

1091
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:21,968
Oh, brother.

1092
01:10:22,053 --> 01:10:24,772
l don't know if you guys
are looney enough.

1093
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:26,161
Looney enough?

1094
01:10:33,093 --> 01:10:34,890
Do you know what time it is?

1095
01:10:34,973 --> 01:10:38,170
Seven-fift-- Seven-fift--
Quarter past seven.

1096
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,608
You have a baseball game in 5 minutes!

1097
01:10:40,893 --> 01:10:42,804
Okay. Take this.

1098
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:44,808
ls it safe?

1099
01:10:44,893 --> 01:10:46,531
Yeah, put it in my bag.

1100
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,607
Let's go.

1101
01:10:48,973 --> 01:10:50,884
l enjoyed playing with you.

1102
01:10:51,053 --> 01:10:52,691
You've got a lot of....

1103
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,443
Whatever it is, you got a lot of it.

1104
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:01,288
Got to go.

1105
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,287
Stay out of trouble.

1106
01:11:05,373 --> 01:11:07,125
You know l will.

1107
01:11:07,613 --> 01:11:09,046
Come here!

1108
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:17,844
The delay is killing us.

1109
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,368
Where's Michael?

1110
01:11:19,453 --> 01:11:21,011
Where is Michael?

1111
01:11:21,173 --> 01:11:23,243
He's not back from his other game.

1112
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,402
What game?

1113
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:26,926
What other game?

1114
01:11:59,853 --> 01:12:01,844
Ladies and gentlemen...

1115
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,086
...Michael Jordan!

1116
01:12:23,133 --> 01:12:24,248
Guys...

1117
01:12:24,413 --> 01:12:25,687
...we suck!

1118
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:28,643
My grandmother plays better.

1119
01:12:28,813 --> 01:12:32,328
You guys are still tall.
l'm nothing now. Just a short guy.

1120
01:12:32,493 --> 01:12:33,369
You're right.

1121
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:35,603
That's the only thing you got right.

1122
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:40,247
-Who's that?
-Who is it?

1123
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:41,288
l don't know.

1124
01:12:41,373 --> 01:12:42,965
You've been getting beaten.

1125
01:12:43,053 --> 01:12:44,088
lt's Mike.

1126
01:12:44,253 --> 01:12:45,686
-What's up?
-Why're you here?

1127
01:12:45,773 --> 01:12:47,206
Don't be embarrassed.

1128
01:12:47,293 --> 01:12:48,646
Just face it.

1129
01:12:49,373 --> 01:12:50,408
You stink.

1130
01:12:50,493 --> 01:12:51,846
Lighten up.

1131
01:12:52,253 --> 01:12:53,208
l know.

1132
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:56,171
You want your games back.
What games you had.

1133
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:58,005
lt's hard enough as it is.

1134
01:12:58,093 --> 01:12:59,412
Give us a break.

1135
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:01,525
l'm going to regret this.

1136
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:04,166
Give me the ball.

1137
01:13:10,413 --> 01:13:12,005
lt's like ''Star Trek.''

1138
01:13:13,373 --> 01:13:14,328
Touch it.

1139
01:13:14,413 --> 01:13:16,085
No way, Jose.

1140
01:13:16,413 --> 01:13:19,450
You want your talent back? Just touch it.

1141
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:22,245
-l don't know.
-Don't touch it.

1142
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:26,804
You'll walk around with a bad game
for the rest of your career. Touch it.

1143
01:13:28,093 --> 01:13:29,367
Careful, Pat.

1144
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,364
We've tried everything else.

1145
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:44,968
Come on.

1146
01:13:45,373 --> 01:13:46,408
Touch it.

1147
01:13:46,573 --> 01:13:47,847
The rest of you.

1148
01:13:47,933 --> 01:13:49,207
Just touch it.

1149
01:13:54,813 --> 01:13:56,963
-What was that?
-l liked that.

1150
01:13:57,613 --> 01:13:59,126
l caught it!

1151
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:01,809
Look at Mugsey handle the rock!

1152
01:14:01,933 --> 01:14:03,491
l can handle it again!

1153
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,525
That's the old Mugs l know.

1154
01:14:05,693 --> 01:14:07,285
Yeah, get height now!

1155
01:14:08,213 --> 01:14:10,169
lt gave me my powers back!

1156
01:14:10,653 --> 01:14:12,644
Let me show you something.

1157
01:14:13,773 --> 01:14:15,525
The Round-Mound is back!

1158
01:14:15,693 --> 01:14:17,251
Want to see something?

1159
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:21,124
That felt good!

1160
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:25,688
-l got it.
-You got it. Yeah, baby.

1161
01:14:26,813 --> 01:14:27,689
Stay.

1162
01:14:27,853 --> 01:14:29,684
Play some 3-on-3 with us?

1163
01:14:30,413 --> 01:14:31,687
l don't think so.

1164
01:14:31,773 --> 01:14:33,764
You going to work on your swing?

1165
01:14:33,853 --> 01:14:37,687
Leave the baseball player alone.
He doesn't play basketball now.

1166
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:40,003
He probably doesn't have it anymore.

1167
01:14:40,813 --> 01:14:44,169
Do you hear them?
They don't think you can play the game.

1168
01:14:47,973 --> 01:14:49,804
There's one way to find out.

1169
01:14:53,893 --> 01:14:56,612
The Chicago Bulls is
proud to welcome back...

1170
01:14:58,133 --> 01:15:00,044
...Michael Jordan!

1171
01:15:13,253 --> 01:15:14,845
What's the matter?

1172
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,483
Larry could have been me.

1173
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:24,044
Will you get off that kick? lt's over.
lt's done with. You can't play.

1174
01:15:29,493 --> 01:15:31,006
Let's go, Bulls!

1175
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:21,763
Well, that's all, folks!

1176
01:23:21,933 --> 01:23:23,366
That's my line.

1177
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,325
Step aside, Babe. Let a star do this.

1178
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:28,807
That's all--

1179
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:31,328
That's all, folks!

1180
01:23:32,493 --> 01:23:34,051
Can l go home now?
