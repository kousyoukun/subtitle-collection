1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,460
我最讨厌恐怖片
l hate scary movies

2
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:44,420
我得K书，我要交生物作业

00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,006
我不是说过 票是免费的吗？
Baby, did l mention these tickets are free?

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,299
免费的
Free

5
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,301
珊卓布拉克的电影也在上映
Sandra Bullock is playing right down the street

6
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,928
没人要花250元看布拉克
Nobody will pay seven fifty to see some Sandra Bullock shit

7
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,014
除非她裸体
Unless she is naked

8
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:58,350
你却会想看没大牌的
But you will sit through a movie called ''Stab''?

9
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,269
“失声尖叫” 刺激肾上腺素
Adrenaline, Maureen

10
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,856
惊吓可刺激起人类本能
lt is good to be scared. lt is primal. You know what l'm saying

11
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,524
我来告诉你这是什么电影
No, l'm gonna tell you what it is. Okay?

12
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:09,445
就是无聊白人女孩被追杀
lt's a dumb ass white movie about some dumb ass white girls・ ・ ・

13
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,990
一部无聊的白人被追杀的电影
getting their white asses cut the fuck up, okay?

14
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,492
你以为珊卓布拉克是黑人啊？
Yeah, and l suppose Sandra Bullock is miss ethnicity? Right?

15
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,829
恐怖片向来排斥黑人
No, l'm saying that the horror genre is historical for excluding ・ ・ ・

16
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,998
恐怖片向来排斥黑人
the African-American element

17
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,751
你几时拿到黑人电影博士学位
When did you get your PHD in black cinema, sister soldier?

18
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:28,172
我有看“娱乐周刊” 我知道
Listen, l read my ''Entertainment Weekly'', l know my shit

Are you going to have a all-black movie?Black-cast? All-black wardrobe

21
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,555
黑眼珠？黑猫？
Black-eyes peas? Black cats?

22
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,268
嘿，拿着
Hi, here you go・ ・ ・

23
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,477
这是什么？
What's this?

24
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,980
纪念品，片厂送的
''Stab'' souvenirs, studio sent them

25
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,358
白色的耶，谢谢
And it's white, thanks

26
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,915
真有够浪漫
Very romantic

27
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,847
改编自魏盖儿原著 “伍兹镇谋杀案”

28
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,539
她干嘛非得裸体？
So, why does she got to be naked? What does that have to do・ ・ ・

29
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,791
她光溜溜的 关剧情什么事
with the plot of the story her being butt-ass naked

30
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,461
那我倒不知道，我勃起了
Well, l don't know about the plot but l have got a stiffy

31
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,379
自己打手枪吧
You better loosen up that wrist

32
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,317
喂
Hello?

33
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:56,986

不，真的，哪位？

你在等人吗？

00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,498
没有
No

39

看后面，看到你男朋友没？
Look out back Do you see your boyfriend anywhere?

44
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,978
我现在没男朋友
l don't even have a boyfriend right now

45
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:33,105
想要一个吗？
Would you like one?

46
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,484
给我钱，我要买爆米花
Give me some money l need to get some popcorn

47
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,902
你自己有钱
You got money

48
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,739
那是我的钱，我要你的钱
l got ''my'' money l asked for your money

49
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,490
你说好不好？
What do you say?

50
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:51,873
快啊，怎么不说话
Come on. Cat got your tongue?

51
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,836
我还不认识你 就不喜欢你了
You know, l don't even know you and l dislike you already

52
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,309
嘿，卖光了
Hey, we're sold out

53
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:22,988
中的爆米花 一杯小健怡可乐
Hi. Can l have a medium popcorn no butter. And a small diet Pepsi

54
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:23,947

够了，我不回里面去
That's it l am not going back in there

56
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,869
胆小鬼，只是电影嘛
Come on, you chicken shit it's just a movie

57
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,037

Not it's not just a movie lt's a true story

58
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:33,790
这些人几年前 在加州被杀
All these kids got killed a couple of years ago in California

59
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:58,940
好讨厌
You ass!

60
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,400
对不起，我只想吓你
l'm sorry, l had to, baby

61
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,859
你干嘛要吓我
Why are you playing?

62
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,488
别紧张
Would you relax?

63
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,575
我不喜欢被吓 我不喜欢
l don't like being scared l don't like that

64
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:10,869
宝贝，只是电影嘛
Baby, it's just a movie

65
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:14,038
而且恐怖片 是很棒的前戏
Besides scary movies are great foreplay

66
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:15,873
拜托！
Excuse me?

67
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,168
我们去看珊卓布拉克好了
Let's go see Sandra Bullock

68
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:23,464
不，都开演了，留下吧
No, Sandra's started already We can stay

69
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,175
你别这么爱闹就好了
Just stop playing so much

70
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:32,223
好，我要上厕所
Alright l have to go to the bathroom

对不起
Sorry

73
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:50,259
有人吗？
Hello?

74
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,335
不…别那么做
No, no! Don't do that

75
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:17,011
快，快，走啊

76
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,436
宝贝，别闹了
Baby, give it up

77
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,442
回来得正好，她快被杀了
You came back just in time, it looks like she's just about to get it

78
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:32,985
要爆米花吗？
Want some popcorn?

79
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:39,826
换成是我，我会离开那边
lf that was me, l'd be out of there

80
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,001
来了
Here it comes

81
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:59,047
惊声尖叫2

82
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:32,288
喂
Hello

83
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:35,958
喂
Hello

84
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,044
喂，席妮
Hello, Sidney

哪位？
Who this is?

86
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,255
你最喜欢哪部恐怖片？
What's your favorite scary movie?

87
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:43,216
哪位？
Who is this?

88
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,218
你告诉我啊
You tell me

89
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:52,517
科瑞吉利斯，5550176
Cory Gillis, 55501 7 6

90
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,225
妈的
Shit

91
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,477
别气馁，科瑞
hot flash, Cory

92
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,023
你可以找刑事检察官
Call criminal offense prosecutor on the penal code 653M

93
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,193
希望你喜欢“失声尖叫”
Hope you enjoy the movie

94
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,154
又要换号码了？
Time to change numbers again

95
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,991
会熬过去的，周末才上映呢
No, it will die off. lt's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes

96
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:10,785
好
Okay

97
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,914
你知道，朗
You know, Ron

98
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:19,001
被冤枉犯罪一定不好受
lt's not an easy thing to be accused of a crime you didn't commit

99
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,878
尤其是谋杀 这么恐怖的罪
Particularly one as heinous as murder

100
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:24,298
真相大白后 大家怎么对待你
But how do people treat you now that they know the truth about your innocence

101
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:25,966
大半人都不错
Most people are good

102
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:28,469
有些人还是保持距离
There are still some that keep a safe distance

103
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:31,138
我觉得很奇怪 毕竟我一向是个平凡人
which is odd for me 'cause l've always been sort of a people person

104
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:34,308
你被冤枉 现已宣判无罪
You were wrongly accused You were fully exonerated

105
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:37,061
曾经被判有罪的人
That and a nickel gets you a cup of coffee

106
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:38,854
要完全洗刷清白 不太容易
Even that's not true anymore

107
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:42,066
魏盖儿的书，还有电影
Certainly with Gale Weather's book and now the movie・ ・ ・

108
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,193
洗刷了卡顿维瑞的冤情
it sets the record straight for Cotton Weary

109
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:47,529
大家可能会觉得 魏盖儿够意思
One would think Gale has been terrific through all this・ ・ ・

110
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,281
快点，要迟到了
Hey! Move your ass, you're late

111
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:52,785
别忘了固定的聚会
And don't forget about the routine mixer and the Delta Lambda Zeta

112
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:56,246
我看我去不了了
l don't think l'll be able to make it, Hal

113
00:13:56,997 --> 00:14:00,542
什么？ 别想翘头，你答应过
What! Don't even try to bag you promised me

114
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:01,919
随便答应而已
A vague promise at best

115
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:06,215
这是免费啤酒 交朋友的派对
Nobody's asking you to join. lt's a party. Free beer, meet the girls

116
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:07,925
你知道我不太喜欢 宗教聚会
Hallie, you know me and organized religion

117
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:08,884
这是姐妹会
lt's a sorority・ ・ ・

118
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:09,885
那更糟
Worse

119
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:13,430
你不要太孤僻
Look Sid, lower the walls for the next few days

120
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:16,892
孤立自己不太好
This self-induced isolation you got going is not healthy

121
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,227
我没事
l'm fine

122
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,479
是，我知道
l'm fine. Yeah, l know

123
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:23,315
说没事却绷着个脸
l'm fine is stretched tightly across your face

124
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,193
赶快看新闻
Check out the news

125
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:34,075
两名温莎学院的学生
The two Windsor college students were murdered last night・ ・ ・

126
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:36,828
昨晚看“失声尖叫”时遇害
during a sneak preview of the new movie, ''Stab''

127
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,832
警方目前只公布被害人姓名
Police have not released any infor- mation except for the victims names

128
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:43,293
但今晚稍后将举行记者会
But a press conference has been scheduled later today

129
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:48,548
两名被害人皆为大四学生
The victims, Maureen Evens & Phil Stevens were both Windsor seniors

130
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,799
蓝迪在哪儿？
Where's Randy?

131
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:52,093
他早上有电影理论课
He's got film theory this morning

132
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:05,940
席妮
Sidney

133
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,817
你认识被害人吗？
Did you know the victims?

134
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,152
这些命案对你造成威胁吗？
Did you feel threatened by the murders?

135
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:10,445
你想会发生更多命案吗？
Do you think they'll be more murders?

136
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,781
告诉我们有关被害人的事
What can you tell us about the victims, Sid?

137
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:15,950
发表一点意见好吗？
We just need one statement

138
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:20,705
电影剧情造成 戏院谋杀事件
You could say what happened in that theater is a direct result of the movie itself

139
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,998
这样子的说法太假道学了
That is so moral majority

140
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:24,501
现实生活的暴力不能怪娱乐
You can't blame real life violence on entertainment

141
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:28,004
当然可以，你不看新闻吗？
Yes, you can Don't you even watch the news?

142
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,423
拜托，凶手戴电影的鬼面具
Hello? The murderer was wearing a Ghost mask

143
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:33,051
不怪电影怪谁
Just like in the movie lt's directly responsible

144
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:36,137
电影不该为我们的行为负责
No, it's not. Movies are not responsible for our actions

145
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:39,390
但电影是模仿现实的伟大艺术
lt's a classic case of life imitating art, imitating life

146
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:41,809
凶杀案不该模仿，更不是艺术
This is not a hypothetical lt's not about that

147
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:45,146
死者是我的同学 这是现实世界
l had biology with that girl This is reality

148
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:46,773
谢谢，我同意
Thank you, l agree with you

149
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:48,816
我告诉你们什么是现实
Let me tell you about reality Mickey

150
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,818
我亲身经历过，好吗？
l lived through this, okay?

151
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:53,112
现实生活是不能被模仿
Life is life lt doesn't imitate anything

152
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:57,158
少来了，蓝迪
Come on, Randy. With all due respect the killer obviously pattered ・ ・ ・

153
00:15:57,283 --> 00:16:00,119
凶手显然在仿效 杀人狂角色
himself, after two serial killers who have been immortalized on film

154
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:00,995
谢谢
Thank you

155
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:04,081
你是说有人想演出续集？
Are you suggesting that someone is trying to make a real life sequel?

156
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:06,834
谁想那么做？续集都很烂
Stab 2? Who would wanna do that Sequel's suck

157
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:11,964
就字意看，续集就是二等的
Oh, please, please. By definition alone, they're inferior films

158
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:15,259
胡扯，很多续集成绩超越原片
Bullshit generalization. Many sequels have surpassed their originals

159
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:16,719
举例一部
Oh yeah? Name one

160
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:19,347
异形续集就比第一集好很多
''Aliens'' Far better than the first

161
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,140
是啊，你品味真有够差
Yeah there's no accounting for taste

162
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:23,517
谢谢，再举一部
Thank you. Ridley Scott rules Name another

163
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:26,103
异形是经典电影
Aliens is a classic, okay

164
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,855
“离她远点，贱货”
''Get away from her, you Bitch''

165
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:31,400
拜托，正确台词是 “别靠近她，贱货”
l believe the line is ''Stay away from her, you Bitch''This is film class right?

166
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:34,069
好，随便，你懂我意思
Whatever, you know what l mean

167
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:35,446
魔鬼终结者2
Another・ ・ ・T-2

168
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,406
你很爱卡麦隆，是不是
You got a hard on for Cameron

169
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:39,158
爱疯了
A big one

170
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,244
第一集已是老掉牙的历史
Wait a second the first Terminator is historical

171
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:45,247
莎拉康纳
''Sarah Conner'' ''Yes''

172
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,127
好，好，“恐怖屋续集”
Alright, alright ''House 2'' the second story

173
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:54,882
所有的恐怖片都被续集破坏了
The entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels

174
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,385
有了，有了
l got it by the way, l got it

175
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:01,096
教父II
The Godfather Part 2

176
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:09,104
很好，获得金像奖的例外
That's very good An Oscar Winning Exception

177
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,940
好，够了，今天到此为止
Alright, that's enough That will be a wrap

178
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:15,402
下次再继续探讨续集
The sequel discussion to be continued

179
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:21,867
创意先生，你如何使续集成功
So, Mister Originality how would you make it different

180
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:24,286
要让结局大爆冷门
l would let the geek get the girl

181
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,918
三百个人在戏院里，没人去救
Three hundred people watching and nobody did anything

182
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,087
他们以为是宣传，天哪
They thought it was a publicity stunt. For Christ's sake

183
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:35,881
如果是宣传 这点子可精彩极了
And it would have been a good one too

184
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:37,340
蓝迪，事情又开始了
lt's starting again, Randy

185
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,217
不，看电影才会碰到倒霉事
lt's not Shit happens at the movies

186
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:41,178
被抢、变残废、被谋杀
People get robbed, shot maimed, murdered

187
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:44,181
影城现在是很危险的地方
The multiplex is just very dangerous place be these days

188
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,516
你不要每件事都否定它
You're in extreme denial

189
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,102
你也该这样 这跟我们无关
And you should be too This has nothing to do with us

190
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,972
戴面具的人在戏院 
Randy. A guy in a Ghost mask hacked up two people・ ・ ・

191
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:54,024
砍了两个人
in a movie theater telling our life stories

192
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:55,150
只是巧合
Coincidence

193
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:58,945
你不能当做没事发生
You know what happened in Woodsboro Randy. You can't ignore it

194
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,114
我知道 我不再重蹈覆辙
l know Sid. l don't wanna go back there again

195
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:03,867
我们不能假装快乐的生活吗
Can't we just go back to our pseudo-quasi happy existence?

196
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,160
德瑞克，你好
Hello Derek, how you doing?

197

席妮，我到处找你

我听说了，你没去上课
l heard, you weren't in class

199
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:12,167

Yeah, l know. l couldn't take all the ''that's her'' looks

200
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,377
有什么我能做的？
ls there anything l can do?

201

有个办法

203
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,761
是吗？是什么？
Oh yeah, what is it?

204

这满不错的
That was pretty good

去开房间啦
Get a room

206
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:49,787
他们威胁要怎样？ 别开玩笑
They're threatening what? Are you kidding me?

207
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,372
让电影下片太蠢了
lt would be stupid to pull this movie

208
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:55,001
免费宣传 这个周末会大卖
All this free press, they're going to have huge numbers this weekend

我指示你就拍
l point, you shoot

217

你想凶手会再犯案吗？

请问你们有任何 预防措施吗？
Can you tell us of any precautions that you are taking?

250

我们认为这是独立的案件
First of all, we think it's just an isolated incident

251

我们会留意很多可能性
And we will be caring out many possibilities

lt's weird, isn't it? To think this fuss is all because of you

361
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:44,466
在书中第32页，你写到
Page thirty-two

362
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:49,763
“笨手笨脚的杜威副警长”
Deputy Dewey filled the room with his Barney Fifish presence

Page forty-one Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience

367
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,990

Don't you think you're overacting just a little bit?

368
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:13,078

二流作家

371
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,169
别见怪
No offense intended

372
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:23,421
我不是故意的…
Dewey, l never meant to imply・ ・ ・

373
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:26,466
你怎么知道我没经验
How do you know my dimwitted inexperience isn't merely a subtle・ ・ ・

374
00:27:26,716 --> 00:27:29,719
难道你是故意贬低我
form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby・ ・ ・

375
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:33,807
免得观众对我期望太高？
enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?

376
00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:44,359
对不起
l'm sorry

377
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:53,409
除了抱歉我不知道该说什么
l don't know what else to say Except, l'm sorry

l think you're talking your psych- major a little too seriously, Hallie

386
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:42,750
我没事
l'm fine

387
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:46,837
“我没事”变成你的口头禅了
That's beginning to become your theme song. l'm fine

388
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:49,757

Do you girls want a drink?

392
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:02,102
我们自己来
Actually, we'll get it ourselves

l love those guys, are they still together?l haven't seen it in 3 weeks

你不会孤军奋战的
You are not alone, Sid

552
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:48,028
不论你需要什么 我们都会陪你
We're all here for you Alright. Whatever you need

553
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,948
死掉的女孩真可怜
Poor girl

554
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:54,243
我知道，整件事都很疯狂
l know, it's crazy

555
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,037
德瑞克可能会被杀
Derek could have been killed you know

556
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,207
但他没有，他没事了
But he wasn't. He's fine

557
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:05,462
他该知道90年代 不能逞英雄
He just need to realize that the 90's are no time to play hero

558
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,548
他为什么要回到屋里？
Why did he go back into that house anyway?

559
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:16,139
我绕到屋后碰到席妮
l went around to the back of the house, and ran into Sid there

560
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:19,101
她说凶手在里面我就去看
That's when she told me the killer was inside. So l went into see・ ・ ・

561
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,895
你很幸运没伤到神经
You're lucky there is no nerve damage

562
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:25,357
这伤慢慢会恢复
You're going to have to take it easy though

563
00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:28,151
然后你回到屋里
So then you went back inside the house

564
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:29,069
对
Yeah

565
00:42:29,194 --> 00:42:31,696
没打斗，他割伤你就跑了？
No struggling he just cut you and ran away?

566
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:33,865
他没杀了你就算你走运
You're lucky he didn't kill you

567
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,992
对，要杀可容易的很
Yeah, it's awfully convenient

568
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:38,036
你说什么？
Say what?

569
00:42:38,453 --> 00:42:42,749
没事，可惜轻易就让他逃走了
Nothing. lt's just a shame he got away so easily

570
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:44,834
可惜你太晚到
lt's just a shame you got there too late

571
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:46,961
他走了之后才出现
Right after he disappeared

572
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,302
是啊
Yeah, it is

573
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:16,241
有三名被害人
We have three victims

574
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:18,868
莫琳艾文斯，菲而史帝文斯
Maureen Evens, Phil Stevens

575
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:22,955
西西库伯
Cici Cooper

576
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:24,707
西西是真名吗？
ls Cici the girl's real name?

577
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:29,170
不是，是凯西库伯
No, it's Casey. Casey Cooper

578
00:43:31,381 --> 00:43:33,299
跟凯西贝克一样？
As in Casey Becker?

579
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:35,468
你说什么？
Excuse me?

580
00:43:36,052 --> 00:43:38,012
凯西贝克是伍兹镇的被害人
She was a young victim in Woodsboro

581
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:42,391
她男朋友史帝文奥斯也是
As well as her boyfriend Steven Orth

582
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:44,227
跟菲而史帝文斯一样
As in Phil Stevens

583
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:47,313
莫琳艾文斯 莫琳普瑞斯卡
Maureen Evens. Maureen Prescott

584
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,023
那是席妮的母亲
that's Sidney's mother

585
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,776
你想有人 在抄袭伍兹镇案？
Do you think someone's trying to duplicate Woodsboro?

586
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:53,444
看起来像
lt looks like it

587
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:58,949
这案子真的是模仿案
l think you have a copycat on your hands, Chief

588
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:00,951
天哪
Jesus Christ・ ・ ・

589
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:03,037
你要怎么让席妮安全？
What are you doing to keep Sidney safe?

590
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:06,082
我派了最优秀的刑警 保护她
l've got my two best detectives guarding her

591
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,002
这两人非得和你 寸步不离吗？
Do these guys have to follow you around everywhere?

592
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:12,463
我们是连体婴
We're attached at the hip

593
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:15,091
我要怎么才能跟你独处
How l am ever going to get you alone?

594
00:44:17,426 --> 00:44:21,130
老实说 
To be honest, Derek, l think it would be best to・ ・ ・

595
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,142
离我远点对你较好
your interest to stay as far away from me as possible

596
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:31,774
别因为情绪不好就说气话
Hope that was a off the cuff remark that holds no sub-text what so ever

597
00:44:32,441 --> 00:44:36,362
其实我说真的
Actually, l mean it

598
00:44:39,823 --> 00:44:42,993
瞧你，你已经受伤了
Look at you, you already got hurt

599
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:45,329
我不想再看到那种事发生
l don't want to see that happen again

600
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:48,999
我运气没那么背
l'll take my chances

601
00:44:49,124 --> 00:44:53,712
我说真的，这很严重
Derek, l'm serious This is serious

602
00:44:56,507 --> 00:45:02,721
你是担心我安危 还是不信任我
You are concerned with my personal well being. And not with ・ ・ ・

603
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,391
我猜对了吧？
trusting me or anything. Right?

604
00:45:10,937 --> 00:45:12,856
我说了我不想看到你受伤
Like l said, l just don't want to see you get hurt

605
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:17,819
我也不想看你受伤，好吗？
And l don't want to see you get hurt. Okay Sid?

606
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:32,375
保重，魏小姐
Take care, Miss Weathers

607
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:36,254
杜威
Dewey

608
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:37,339
警长
Chief

609
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:44,721
我要去搜集资料 你要来吗？
Hi, l'm headed over to admissions to do some leg work, You game?

610
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:48,808
我可不帮你写书 我来帮席妮
l'm not here to write a book l'm here to help Sid

611
00:45:51,311 --> 00:45:52,437
我也想帮她
l wanna help her too

612
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:57,025
当然也为了帮我自己
And help myself, of course

613
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:03,239
别这样，笑一个，拜托
Come on, Dewey Smile just once, please

614
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:07,243
等我抓到凶手也会笑
l'll smile when l catch the killer

615
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:11,915
盖儿，嗨
Gale, Hi

616
00:46:11,998 --> 00:46:14,959
席妮的父亲没嫌疑了吗？
What about Sidney's father? Has he been ruled out as a suspect?

617
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:17,921
他出国了，这有点可疑
He's out of the country on business that sounds a little fishy.

618
00:46:18,004 --> 00:46:20,423
你做你的调查，这和我无关
l'm not here to do your job Mrs Salt

619
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:23,718
杜威呢，他的出现有点怪
What about this ex-cop Dewey Riley? Kind of strange that he showed up

620
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:24,469
他来做什么？
What's he doing here?

621
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:28,014
杜威是好人 他和其他人不一样
Dewey's a good guy Unlike some of us

622
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:30,683
真的？
Really?

623
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:36,063
我只是觉得事件如果重演
lf the killer is repeating what happened in Woodsboro

624
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:38,983
凶手很可能是伍兹镇的人
lt could be quite possible that killer could be from Woodsboro

625
00:46:43,863 --> 00:46:47,158
你想席妮会让我访问她吗？
Derek, do you think Sid would let me interview her for my documentary

626
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:51,495
她婉拒各大电视和新闻媒体
Didn't she turn down ''Primetime Live'', ''20-20'', and ''Dateline''

627
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:53,205
但可以为了你的纪录片
But for you, yeah

628
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:54,290
别闹了
Drop it

629
00:46:54,373 --> 00:46:56,459
我在想谋杀的事
l've been thinking about his whole murder thing

630
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:58,169
你们查过蓝迪没有？
Have you checked out Randy?

631
00:46:58,252 --> 00:46:58,919
什么？
What!

632
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:01,130
我知道他是无辜受害者
l know he's an innocent victim the first time around

633
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:03,132
但他有点怪，懂我意思吧！
But he's a little off You know what l'm saying?

634
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:05,426
蓝迪不会伤害人
Come on, Randy? The guy is harmless

635
00:47:06,218 --> 00:47:07,887
许多杀人魔也都被这么认为
That's what they said about Damher

636
00:47:08,012 --> 00:47:09,513
小声点
Guys, keep it down, come on

637
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,890
怎么了？席妮
What's up, Sid?

638
00:47:11,057 --> 00:47:13,267
怎么了？
How's it going?

639
00:47:13,893 --> 00:47:15,102
保镖刑警在哪里？
Where's the Secret Service guys?

640

哪个是凯文科斯纳？

右边的是李察警官

646
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,335
德瑞克，你要说什么
Derek, a penny for your thoughts?

647
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:45,382
早上醒来我有个感觉
This morning l woke up with this feeling

648
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:48,844
不知如何面对
l didn't know how to deal with

649
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:56,268
于是我决定藏在心里
And so l just decided to myself l'd hide it to myself

650
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:57,936
他在干嘛？

Though it worries me to say l've never felt this way

l think l love you lsn't that what life is made of

And though it worries me to say it l've never felt this way

我知道情况有点疯狂

那不是兄弟会的大忌吗？

672
00:49:35,992 --> 00:49:37,368
对，万万不可

我看了书…

他们竟让托莉史培林演席妮

686
00:50:24,248 --> 00:50:26,041
至少演你的还有些名气
At least you get David Schwimmer

687
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:30,171
演我的是珍西摩儿的马车夫
l get the guy who drove Jane Seymour's stagecoach in one episode of Doctor Quinn

688
00:50:31,422 --> 00:50:34,758
以下是托莉演出的片段
Let's take a peak at the movie・ ・ ・

689
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:44,059
比利，你吓到我了，你干嘛！
Billy, you scared me what are you doing here?

690
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:47,187
我获释了，我是清白的
They let me go Sid l didn't do it. l'm innocent

691
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:48,856
我知道
l know

692
00:50:50,441 --> 00:50:52,025
你为什么不让我碰你？
Why won't you let me touch you?

693
00:50:53,777 --> 00:50:57,823
我最近碰到太多事
Look, l've been going through a lot lately, Billy

694
00:50:57,948 --> 00:51:01,410
你要勇敢面对它好好活下去
Sid, l think you just need to deal with that and move on

695
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:07,499
我也要接受我妈离开我爸
When my mom left my dad, l accepted it.That's the way the cookie crumbles

696
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:08,500
妈妈总会离开我们
Moms leave

697
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:12,754
她离开镇上，不是埋在地下
Yeah, your mom left town. She's not buried in the cemetery somewhere

698
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,717
我妈死了，再也不会回来
My mom's dead and she's never coming back. Ever

699
00:51:19,386 --> 00:51:20,846
笨
Stupid

700
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:22,889
我最爱看恐怖片
l love scary movies

701
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:23,932
我会等录影带上了再说
l'll wait for the video

702
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:25,475
好，谈正事
Okay, let's get down to business

703
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:27,811
我看马上就有人要怕续集
The way l see it someone's out to make a sequel

704
00:51:27,936 --> 00:51:30,355
我们得搜集更多谋杀电影
You know, cash in on all the murder movie hoopla

705
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,899
所以我们要了解续集电影规则
So it's our job to observe the rules of a sequel

706
00:51:33,025 --> 00:51:35,235
第一，死得更多
Number one the body count is always bigger

707
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:38,280
第二，死得更难看
Number two, the death scenes are always much more elaborate. More・ ・ ・

708
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:43,201
观众会期待更精彩的场面
blood, more gore. Carnage Candy Your core audience just expects it

709
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:44,286
第三
And number three・ ・ ・

710
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:47,205
想让续集卖座就千万别…
lf you want your sequel to become a franchise never, ever・ ・ ・

711
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,749
我只想知道怎么找到凶手
How do we find the killer, Randy? That's what l want to know

712
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:52,127
我们看看嫌犯
Let's look at the suspects

713
00:51:52,252 --> 00:51:55,338
德瑞克，就像她前任男朋友
There's Derek the obvious boyfriend Hello Billy Loomis

714
00:51:55,505 --> 00:51:57,841
他学医，用那点小伤搏取同情
The guy's pre-med and his pity-me service wound

715
00:51:57,966 --> 00:52:01,052
那小伤完全避开了主要血管
conveniently missed every major vein and artery

716
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:02,846
你认为是德瑞克？
So you think it's Derek?

717
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:02,847
Not so fast

718
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:02,847
别太快下断语

719
00:52:04,014 --> 00:52:06,474
假设凶手是有点小聪明
Let's assume the killer or killers have half a brain

720
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:08,768
他就不会去重蹈覆辙
He's not a ''Nick at Night'' re-run type of guy

721
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:11,563
他要另外再找新点子
He wants to break some new ground Right?

722
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:14,691
别管男友，太老套了，还有谁
forget the boyfriend lt's tired. Who else do we got?

723
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,486
米奇，那个昆汀塔伦提诺迷
Mickey The freaky Tarantino film student

724
00:52:20,363 --> 00:52:23,908
如果他是 那我也有嫌疑，再想
But if he is a suspect So am l. So let's move on

725
00:52:24,325 --> 00:52:27,787
等一下，搞不好你正是嫌犯
Let's not move on Maybe you are a suspect

726
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:31,165
我是嫌犯，那你也是
lf l'm a suspect, you're a suspect

727
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,335
有理
You have a point

728
00:52:36,004 --> 00:52:38,715
好，继续
Okay, let's move on

729
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:40,091
海莉
Hallie

730
00:52:40,216 --> 00:52:41,342
席妮的室友？
Sid's roommate?

731
00:52:42,343 --> 00:52:44,262
典型杀人狂是白种男性
Serial killers are typically white males

732
00:52:44,387 --> 00:52:47,890
这样才完美，违反规则
That's why it's perfect. lt's sort of against the rules, but not really

733
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:50,852
黑人小姐是绝佳的杀人狂
Mrs. Voohies was a terrific serial killer

734
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:52,854
总得给黑人小姐一个机会
And there's always room for Candy Man's daughter

735
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:56,733
她甜美，所以危险
She's sweet. She's deadly She's bad for your teeth

736
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:02,530
拜托，这些人是你朋友
Come on, Randy These kids are your friends

737
00:53:03,406 --> 00:53:04,991
你认为谁是凶手
Who do you think is the killer?

738
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,075
魏盖儿怎么样？
How about Gale Weathers?

739
00:53:06,242 --> 00:53:08,244
盖儿，凶手？
Gale, a killer?

740
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:09,912
为什么不？
Why not?

741
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,081
她心眼够坏
She's vicious enough

742
00:53:12,248 --> 00:53:13,875
她只是个机会主意者
She's an opportunist

743
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:16,460
想不到吗？她在筹备下一本书
lsn't it conceivable She's planning her next book

744
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:19,380
记者最会炒新闻了
That's what reporters do Dewey. They stage the news

745
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:23,426
不，盖儿绝不会是凶手
No, Gale's a lot of things but Gale's not a killer

746
00:53:23,551 --> 00:53:25,177
你太迷恋她了
Just because you're sweet on her

747
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:25,886
我没有
l'm not

748
00:53:26,053 --> 00:53:28,180
拜托，我是蓝迪哎
Please, this is me talking, Randy

749
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,725
我是单恋席妮的爱情奴隶耶
The unrequited love slave of Sidney Prescott

750
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,476
我知道什么是执迷不误
l know all about obsession

751
00:53:34,395 --> 00:53:35,479
这很痛苦
and pain

752
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,231
你有爱的伤疤来证明
And you've got your love scar to prove it

753
00:53:37,398 --> 00:53:38,774
你也有
And so do you

754
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:41,902
你怎么会跛脚？ 因为你被刺到背
Man, what is with that limp anyway? 'Cause you were stabbed in the back

755
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:43,237
因为神经被切断
Severed nerve

756
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:45,990
但盖儿绝不是凶手
Look, Gale's no killer

757
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:48,534
好，随便你怎么说
Okay, okay, whatever you say

758
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:52,955
她不是凶手，就是目标
But if she's not a killer she's a target

759
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,542
乔，拍一些背景画面
Joel, let's get some establishing shots

760
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,460
可以谈一下吗？
Gale, can we talk for a second?

761
00:53:58,585 --> 00:53:59,295
什么事？
What is it?

762
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,298
我搞不懂 以你过去的遭遇
Look, l'm a little confused here l mean, with your track record

763
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:05,843
现在又发生凶案 何必在这逗留
Why would you want to be here when the killer strikes again?

764
00:54:05,968 --> 00:54:08,929
我应该在接下工作前 看你的书
l mean granted, l should have read your book. Before l took this job

765
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:11,431
我正在看，哇
But, l'm reading it now, and whoa

766
00:54:11,974 --> 00:54:13,934
才知道前一个摄影师的下场
l read what happened to your last cameraman

767
00:54:14,143 --> 00:54:15,060
他被开膛剖肚
The guy got gutted

768
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,814
我现在要做一般人会做的事
Now me? l would do what any rational human being should do

769
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:20,274
那就是走人
Which is get the fuck out of here

770
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,068
他没被开膛剖肚 那是我编的
First of all, he wasn't gutted l made that up

771
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:24,903
他是喉咙被割断
His throat was slashed

772
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:28,699
反正他已不在人世了
Gale, gutted-slashed the guy ain't in the union no more

773
00:54:28,824 --> 00:54:30,242
这是工作
lt's a job, Joel

774
00:54:30,826 --> 00:54:33,120
所有工作都有一些风险
And like every job there's a few drawbacks

775
00:54:33,245 --> 00:54:36,248
你是专业摄影师就敬业点
You're a professional cameraman You've got to act like one

776
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:39,084
我只想报新闻 不想变成新闻
Yeah, but l want to report the news l don't want to be the news

777
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:42,254
黑人在这种情况下 都活不久
Besides, ''Brothers'' don't last long in situations like this

778
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,297
这是全国电视网
This is national television

779
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,801
这是成名的大好良机
Think about it This is a big chance for you

780
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:50,971
你不想参与 轰动全国的报导？
The story is monumental Don't you want to be a part of that?

781
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:57,310
我需要你，没你我做不到
Come on, l need you l cannot do this without you

782
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:03,275
好，干活吧
Good, come on Let's get some work done

783
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,151
好，准备去被宰吧
Yeah, let's go get killed

784
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,073
我们先前谈过了
We've been through this before

785
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:12,659
你知道我认为 你很有表演潜力
You know what l think of your potential as an actress

786
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:17,747
我知道，只是命案的事
l know it's just that with the murders

787
00:55:17,872 --> 00:55:21,126
那部电影和我的人生都一团乱
And the movie, and my life

788
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:23,253
我知道这对你很困难
l do know how difficult it is for you

789
00:55:25,463 --> 00:55:28,174
我觉得我做不到
Gil, l just don't think l can do it

790
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:32,095
你必须利用艺术来化解忧虑
The battle for the soul is fought in the forum of the art

791
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,180
你是斗士，所以你在这儿
You're a fighter Sid That's why you're here

792
00:55:34,305 --> 00:55:35,890
所以你会主修戏剧
That's why this is your major

793
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:37,392
对，我是斗士
Yeah, l'm a fighter

794
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:38,768
我没听到
l didn't hear that

795
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:40,979
我是斗士
l'm a fighter

796
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:42,355
我不相信你
l don't believe you

797
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:47,068
我不信
l don't

798
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,196
我是斗士
l'm a fighter

799
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:53,241
好
Okay

800
00:55:55,743 --> 00:55:59,163
我知道这样说太LKK了
So at the risk sounding like a college drama teacher

801
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:02,041
但我要利用这种痛苦
if you have pain around this type of material, use it

802
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,001
这是你的角色
This is your role, Sid

803
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:08,548
卡珊德拉是悲剧性 的预言家
Cassandra is one of the great tragic visionaries of literature

804
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:10,841
她全预料到了
She saw it all coming

805
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:15,346
战争，谋杀，疯狂
The wars, the murder, the madness

806
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:19,433
她知道她被诅咒
She knew she was cursed

807
00:56:20,434 --> 00:56:22,979
那是她的宿命，她拥抱它
lt was her fate and she embraced it

808
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:27,358
宿命难逃，但身为艺术家
None of us can avoid our fate But as an artist・ ・ ・

809
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:32,321
你能诚实的面对它，对抗它
you can honestly face it and fight it

810
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:37,409
你真行
You're good

811
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,495
没替角，我一定要说服你
There's no understudy l'm desperate

812
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:45,334
你做得到的
You can do this

813
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:54,093
好，大家集合，第三幕
Okay, everybody gather around third act, one last time

814
00:56:54,259 --> 00:56:55,261
音乐来
Cue the music

815
00:57:09,274 --> 00:57:13,445
看，特洛伊城可怕的恶运
Behold the dreaded fate of Troy

816
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:18,909
曾伫立照亮斯巴达的山坡
That once stood proud and light upon the hills of Sparta

817
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:23,247
如今笼罩在废墟的烟雾中
Now shrouded in the deathly smoke of ruin

818
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:27,417
其王室子女从墙上被抛下
Her royal children picthed from her walls

819
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:32,756
子民从废墟中被驱赶而过
Her people driven through her ruins

820
00:57:32,923 --> 00:57:40,097
卡珊德拉孤独站在残忍宿命中
And now, alone in Fate's cruel isolation stands Cassandra

821
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:44,267
她的王国，家人和朋友
Her kingdom, family and friends

822
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:46,728
被赶到大门口
driven to the gate

823
00:57:49,856 --> 00:57:54,861
我未犯下反神之罪
No crime against God or man have l committed

824
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:58,073
除了说出真相
Save to speak the truth

825
00:57:58,865 --> 00:58:05,163
我心中的可怕预言皆已降临
And each hideous vision born from my mind has come to pass

826
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:08,208
特洛伊沦陷了
Troy has fallen

827
00:58:09,084 --> 00:58:13,296
不是藉我的手或愿望
Not by my hand, or wish

828
00:58:14,255 --> 00:58:16,174
而是如我预见的
But as l foresaw

829
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,473
如今宿命复仇之眼
So now, Fate's vengeful eye・ ・ ・

830
00:58:25,286 --> 00:58:29,832
盯上了...我
is fixed ・ ・ ・on me

831
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:33,794
告诉我们，卡珊德拉
Tell us O Cassandra

832
00:58:34,128 --> 00:58:37,131
生命的甜美如今何在
where has the sweetness of life gone?

833
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:41,052
如何让宿命之手不攻击你
What stays fate's hand from striking now at three?

834
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,460
好，暂停
Alright, hold it

835
00:59:15,502 --> 00:59:16,545
暂停
Hold it

836
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:19,798
大家休息一下
Everyone take five

837
00:59:35,689 --> 00:59:36,774
席妮
Sidney?

838
00:59:50,204 --> 00:59:53,540
你的护花使者来了
Sid. Your escort has arrived

839
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:55,584
德瑞克，你来多久了？
Derek, how long have you been here?

840
00:59:55,709 --> 00:59:58,170
刚到，还好吧？ 怎么回事？
l just got here. ls everything okay what's going on?

841
00:59:58,295 --> 00:59:59,504
米奇呢？
What happened to Mickey?

842
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,797
我们调换，他要剪接
We swapped. He had to edit

843
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:02,632
我来接，怎么了？
You get me instead. What happened?

844
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:04,134
不要…
Derek, don't・ ・ ・

845
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:10,599
我现在需要独处，好吗？
l just l need to be alone right now. Okay?

846
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:16,229
独处不是办法
Being alone is not the answer, Sid

847
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:23,528
我的意思是我需要距离
Yeah, l think it is l need some distance

848
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:29,284
我还能说什么？
Well, do l get a say in this?

849
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:32,370
别说了
No

850
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:41,838
我知道我该体谅你
l guess l'm supposed to be understanding

851
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,632
没错
Yeah

852
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:53,141
没问题
You got it

853
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,361
如果凶手在重演 伍兹镇血案
Alright, let's just assume that the killer is repeating Woodsboro

854
01:01:06,612 --> 01:01:07,322
喂
Yes?

855
01:01:07,947 --> 01:01:09,198
我再打给你
l have to call you back

856
01:01:09,616 --> 01:01:11,576
那他干嘛要攻击席妮
That doesn't explain Sidney's attack

857
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:14,203
她在伍兹镇又没被杀掉
Sidney wasn't killed in Woodsboro

858
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:16,247
她只是逃过一劫
lt wasn't for a lack of trying

859
01:01:16,914 --> 01:01:18,833
凶手想做个了结
The killer is trying to finish what was started

860
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:20,710
席妮有人保护，对吗？
Sid is under protection, right?

861
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:21,919
对
Yeah

862
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:23,546
干嘛？
What?

863
01:01:23,671 --> 01:01:25,756
跟鲍伯说我会打给他
Tell Bob l'll call him back

864
01:01:26,507 --> 01:01:27,884
她几时开始抽烟了？
When did she start smoking?

865
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:29,802
从网路上出现 她的裸照开始
Ever since those nude pictures on the lnternet

866
01:01:29,927 --> 01:01:32,388
那是我的头，玛丹娜的身体
lt was just my head lt was Jennifer Aniston's body

867
01:01:32,513 --> 01:01:33,764
我们一定忘了什么重点
Anyway, you're forgetting something

868
01:01:34,182 --> 01:01:36,517
在伍兹镇有更多被害人
ln Woodsboro, there were more victims before the home stretch

869
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:39,353
泰坦，他是我的摄影师
Tatum, my cameraman, Himbry

870
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:42,898
暂停，我不想听摄影师的事
Time out. See l don't need to be hearing about no dead cameraman

871
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,111
我警告你们，我要闪人了
Now l'm warning you guys, l'm a verb away from vacating these premises

872
01:01:47,361 --> 01:01:49,905
我去买咖啡 甜甜圈和镇定剂
l'm gonna go get me some coffee, donuts, Prozac

873
01:01:50,197 --> 01:01:52,867
看能不能找到一些快乐丸
See if l can find some crack special K, Eggs

874
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:57,371
等你们谈完我再回来
l'll be back when you guys start talking about something little more ''Save By The Bellish'' Alright?

875
01:01:59,707 --> 01:02:01,167
他好像很害怕
He seems a little shaky

876
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:02,460
别担心他
Don't worry about him

877
01:02:02,668 --> 01:02:03,961
我们要找出凶手杀人模式
lf the killer is following a pattern

878
01:02:04,211 --> 01:02:05,796
看谁是下一个受害者
then maybe we can figure out who is next

879
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:09,633
没有模式 我们都被追杀过
That wouldn't follow the pattern we were all involved in Woodsboro

880
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:11,135
我们任何一个 都可能被害
lt could be anyone of us

881
01:02:11,302 --> 01:02:13,095
好，那你想怎样？
Okay so what do you want to do, Bonehead?

882
01:02:13,304 --> 01:02:15,389
等着看下一个是谁吗？ 蠢蛋
You just want to sit here and wait for who drops next?

883
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:18,309
我不知道，电话小姐
l don't know, phonehead

884
01:02:22,354 --> 01:02:23,355
盖儿不在
Gale's not here

885
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:28,318
打搅你们吗？ 你们好像很烦恼
l'm not interrupting anything, am l You three look deep in thought

886
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:34,658
尝过刀子割肉的滋味吗？
Have you ever felt a knife cut through human flesh and scrape the bone beneath?

887
01:02:35,576 --> 01:02:36,577
是他
lt's him

888
01:02:37,703 --> 01:02:38,412
谁？
Who?

889
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:41,331
凶手，他看得到我们
The killer! He can see us

890
01:02:47,337 --> 01:02:48,672
别让他挂电话
Just keep him on the phone

891
01:02:49,214 --> 01:02:50,215
我要跟他说什么？
What do you want me to say?

892
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:53,385
不知道，让他继续讲，走
l don't know. Just keep him talking. Come on, Gale

893
01:02:55,178 --> 01:02:55,846
我们要干嘛？
What are we doing?

894
01:02:55,929 --> 01:02:58,473
找有行动电话的人
Look for somebody with a cell-phone

895
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:00,267
你最喜欢哪部恐怖片？
So, what's your favorite scary movie?

896
01:03:00,392 --> 01:03:01,560
你们绝对找不到我
You'll never find me

897
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:04,187
你怕什么？ 让他们去玩
What do you care let them have their fun

898
01:03:05,439 --> 01:03:08,316
那你要干嘛？
So, what's up?

899
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:10,861
你最喜欢哪部恐怖片？
What's your favorite scary movie?

900
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:14,322
“美国舞娘”吓死人了
Show girls. Absolutely frightening

901
01:03:14,531 --> 01:03:15,615
你呢？
What's yours?

902
01:03:16,742 --> 01:03:17,200
对不起
Sorry・ ・ ・

903
01:03:17,325 --> 01:03:18,201
你要干嘛？
What's your problem?

904
01:03:18,326 --> 01:03:21,621
等等，让我猜，惊魂夜
Wait, let me guess The House on Sorority Row?

905
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:24,624
滴血校舍，溅血校园
Dorm that dripped Blood? Splatter University?

906
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:27,127
结业日，期终考
Graduation Day? Final Exam?

907
01:03:27,544 --> 01:03:28,378
我很接近你吗？
Am l close?

908
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:29,421
比你想像中近
Closer than you think

909
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:35,385
猜错了，你想死吗？
Too slow you Geek Do you want to die?

910
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:36,886
这已经是你最厉害 的招数啦？
ls that the best you can do?

911
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,222
第一集的凶手 都比你有创意
Because Billy and Stu were much more original

912
01:03:41,808 --> 01:03:42,767
你是哪位？
Who's this?

913
01:03:43,226 --> 01:03:45,729
伍兹镇血案的作者魏盖儿
Gale Weathers author of the Woodsboro Murders

914
01:03:45,854 --> 01:03:46,855
谁？
Who?

915
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,693
好，他一定在这附近
Okay, he's got to be around here someplace

916
01:03:52,736 --> 01:03:53,820
他在耍我们
He's just playing with us

917
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,867
白种男性嫌犯 九点种方向
White male suspect nine o'clock

918
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:00,743
我的表或你的表？
My clock or your clock

919
01:04:00,952 --> 01:04:04,372
你的表，绕到后面
Your clock. Go around the back

920
01:04:06,874 --> 01:04:11,546
你来干嘛？ 你绝不会是男主角
Why are you even here Randy? You'll never be the leading man

921
01:04:12,463 --> 01:04:14,424
去你的
Fuck you

922
01:04:14,507 --> 01:04:18,136
你再努力也当不了英雄
No matter how hard you try you'll never be the hero

923
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,805
而且永远无法得到席妮
And you'll never ever get the girl

924
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:23,558
妈的，对不起
Shit! Sorry・ ・ ・

925
01:04:24,267 --> 01:04:26,227
倒霉鬼，死人
Wrong guy, dead boy

926
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,522
是吗？ 想重新再杀人一次吗？
Oh yeah? Let's redirect mister

927
01:04:29,647 --> 01:04:30,690
我很有创意哦
''l'm so original''

928
01:04:39,282 --> 01:04:40,158
搞什么鬼？
What the hell are you doing?

929
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,622
抱歉，对不起
Sorry, Beg your pardon

930
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:48,291
你的创意在哪？
Where's your innovation?

931
01:04:48,457 --> 01:04:51,294
干嘛模仿两个 高中窝囊废
Why copy-cat two High School looser-ass dick heads

932
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:53,921
史都是没种的娘娘腔

而比利鲁米斯，搞什么

Jesus! What a rat-looking homo repressed mama's boy

935
01:05:02,388 --> 01:05:05,641
目标订高点，想当大人物吗？
Why not set your goals higher You want to be one of the big boys?

936
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:09,937
辛普森，高天民，陈进兴
Manson? Bundy? OJ?

937
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:49,268

没看到他
l don't see him

939
01:05:57,317 --> 01:05:58,485
蓝迪
Randy

940
01:06:01,196 --> 01:06:01,822
怎么回事？
What's going on?

941
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:06,201
谁把我的车窗打破了
Who broke my window?

942
01:06:40,819 --> 01:06:42,445
你的电脑不动了吗？
Did your computer just freeze?

943
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:46,825
你有讯息，按ALT一M
You have an instant message that's all. Just hit Alt-M

944
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,286
可是我还没上线
Yeah, but l'm not signed on

945
01:06:49,411 --> 01:06:52,372
所有终端机都有连线
Someone here in the library all the terminals are connected

946
01:07:04,926 --> 01:07:06,344
“你今晚会死”

他在这边

948
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,479
“警察救不了你” 把她带开，可能是病态的玩笑
Get her away from the computer Sid, it's probably just a sick joke

949
01:07:21,526 --> 01:07:22,610
在这边等
Wait right here, okay

950

你还好吗？

可以谈一下吗？

01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:39,627
现在不是时候
This isn't a good time

954
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:41,587
别这样，是你害我坐牢的
Come on Sid, you sent me to prison

955
01:07:41,712 --> 01:07:44,257
坐一年牢 不能给我两分种
lt's been over a year for you you can give me two minutes

956
01:07:44,882 --> 01:07:47,802
我很遗憾 我不知该如何道歉
Cotton, l'm sorry. Everyday l'm sorry. l don't know how to apologize

957
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:51,889

958
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:53,808
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

959
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:56,310
别管魏盖儿，她什么都不懂
First of all, forget Gale Weathers

960
01:07:56,477 --> 01:07:59,438
她不明白你我之间的故事
She doesn't get it. She doesn't see the story between you and me

961
01:07:59,564 --> 01:08:02,858
即使凶手杀了她 她都不知为什么
She wouldn't see the story if it smacked her in the side of the head

962
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:06,195
重点是你知道谁找我吗？
Which brings me to my point Who calls me out of the blue?

963
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,824
黛安索而，够吓人吧
Diane Sawyer. Believe me Sid l was as shocked as you are

964
01:08:10,157 --> 01:08:15,246
我们可以有 整整一小时的节目
lf you and l go on the air together She will give us the entire hour

965
01:08:15,496 --> 01:08:19,250
而且是黄金时段
We are talking Prime Time, Sid You, me and Diane Sawyer

966
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,376
我做不到
Cotton, l can't

967
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:25,464
他们付我们一人一万块
lf this is about money lt's not like we're not getting paid $1 0,000 dollars each

968
01:08:25,631 --> 01:08:28,092
更别提 还有计费的CALL IN
Not to mentioned what l got going on the side with the #900 number

969
01:08:28,175 --> 01:08:31,554
我知道你不喜欢媒体
l know. You don't like the press

970
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:37,101
我很尊重你，可是席妮…
l know that and l respect it But Sidney

971
01:08:37,601 --> 01:08:39,812
这是黛安索而哎
lt's Diane Sawyer. Hello?

972
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:45,150
她很大牌，曝光率会很高
She's a class act. This could be some very, very heavy exposure

973
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,361
对不起
l'm sorry

974
01:08:48,362 --> 01:08:53,325
大家都从电影和书知道真相
Look, between the movie, & the book People know the truth

975
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:56,662
曝光够多了，你还要怎样
Let's get on our lives There's been enough exposure

976
01:08:56,787 --> 01:08:58,247
不能平静地生活吗？
Why would you want anymore?

977
01:08:58,872 --> 01:09:01,792
要怎样？我不知道哎
Why? l don't know, Sidney

978
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,086
我想更出名吧！
Maybe because l fucking deserve a little exposure

979
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:06,838
别这样，是你先毁掉我的名誉
Come on Sidney, you drag my name through the mud

980
01:09:06,922 --> 01:09:09,132
让大家都以为我是变态凶手
Everybody thinks l'm some kind of Psycho killer

981
01:09:09,258 --> 01:09:12,344
我只是要求做个访问
& all l'm asking for is one little fucking Diane Sawyer interview

982
01:09:12,511 --> 01:09:14,513
让我澄清我的罪名
To maybe give my side of the story straight

983
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,101
这不会太不近人情吧？
l don't think l'm being unreasonable in that request. Do you honestly?

984
01:09:21,603 --> 01:09:24,439
抱歉，不行
l'm sorry, Cotton, but no

985
01:09:26,149 --> 01:09:28,193
你抱歉
You are sorry

986
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,239
我敢说你真的很抱歉
l bet you're real sorry, Sidney

987
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:34,574
你到底想怎样？
What's your angle, Sidney?

988
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:37,452
可爱倒霉的 席妮普瑞斯卡
Lovable and fucked up Sidney Prescott

989
01:09:37,577 --> 01:09:39,830
最受欢迎的受害人
Everybody's favorite little victim

990
01:09:41,373 --> 01:09:42,666
你们做什么？
What are you doing?

991
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:46,419
天哪，我不是比利
Jesus! l'm not Billy Loomis

992
01:09:46,586 --> 01:09:48,254
他杀了她，他死了 记得吗？
she killed him, he's dead, remember?

993
01:09:49,631 --> 01:09:52,258
再跟我讲一遍，好吗？
Run it by me one more time Will you?

994
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:54,761
你为什么攻击席妮？
Why did you attack Sidney Prescott

995
01:09:54,844 --> 01:09:58,598
哪有攻击 只是谈得很激烈
There was not attack We were talking, very heatedly

996
01:09:58,807 --> 01:10:03,102
席妮和我 有段复杂的过去
Miss Prescott and l have a very complicated past

997
01:10:04,854 --> 01:10:06,398
和她有口角不算犯罪
l didn't think that was a crime

998
01:10:06,564 --> 01:10:07,774
没有 若有谋杀意图就有罪
No, but homicide is

999
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:10,902
那就收押我
Then book me. Book me

1000
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:14,405
谋杀的事我不懂
Okay? Look l don't know about homicide

1001
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,617
但你们因为 我在图书馆喧哗而抓我
But you defiantly got me for raising my voice in a public library

1002
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:22,413
这是四起命案 讲话当心点
We're dealing with four murders here. You watch your mouth

1003
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:30,129
不该杀蓝迪，应该杀我
lt shouldn't have been Randy lt should have been me

1004
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:34,884
我应该打给他母亲
l should call his mother

1005
01:10:35,259 --> 01:10:37,220
我打过了
Sid, l already made that phone call

1006
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:43,184
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1007
01:10:44,143 --> 01:10:46,938
我没那么脆弱，轻易被击倒
Stop treating me like glass, Dewey l'm not going to break

1008
01:10:47,563 --> 01:10:48,731
有时脆弱一点没关系
lt's okay to break

1009
01:10:50,483 --> 01:10:51,776
我不会让它表现出来
lt's not going to happen

1010
01:10:52,652 --> 01:10:54,779
你最好有充分的不在场理由
You better hope your alibi is air-tight

1011
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:58,658
容我提醒各位我是清白的
Could l please remind everyone here that l'm an innocent man

1012
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:01,786
你们不看2100全民开讲吗？
Don't you watch TV ''Current Edition''

1013
01:11:01,952 --> 01:11:04,789
很犀利的电视节目
That was a very insightful program On which it was made abundantly・ ・ ・

1014
01:11:04,872 --> 01:11:06,624
这节目明白指出过我的清白
clear that l'm an innocent man

1015
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:10,503
除非你们亲眼目睹 我持刀杀人
So until you find me standing over a dead body with a knife in my hand

1016
01:11:10,628 --> 01:11:15,549
否则请给我个公道
l think you better treat me with the rights and privileges accorded to every citizen in this country

1017
01:11:20,763 --> 01:11:23,891
还是你们不了解 什么叫无辜？
ls there some problem with the word innocent

1018
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:26,102
很重要的字，警长？是吧
l don't know lt's a big one, Chief?

1019
01:11:37,446 --> 01:11:38,405
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1020
01:11:38,697 --> 01:11:39,406
我们得放他走
We're going to let him go

1021
01:11:39,531 --> 01:11:40,574
为什么？
Why?

1022
01:11:40,783 --> 01:11:42,326
没证据关他
We don't have anything on him

1023
01:11:46,747 --> 01:11:47,623

戏好看吗？ 警察真可笑
enjoying the show? Cops are funny

1026
01:11:58,175 --> 01:11:59,176
你在做什么？
What do you think you're doing?

1027
01:11:59,343 --> 01:12:03,347
等你访问我十五分种，懂吧
Waiting for my 1 5 minutes of fame You can understand that, can't you?

1028
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:08,894
别做傻事，卡顿
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton

1029
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:12,522
你帮了大忙让我自由
You were so instrumental in my freedom

1030
01:12:13,357 --> 01:12:15,651
你不会是后悔吧
You're not having character doubts now, are you?

1031
01:12:21,907 --> 01:12:23,533
席妮，如果你改变心意…
Sidney, if you change your mind ・ ・ ・

1032
01:12:23,909 --> 01:12:25,243
好了，让开吧！
Come on, take a hike

1033

真遗憾遇到这个怪胎
Sorry about that. What a creep

1034

我们带你到安全的地方

1035
01:12:34,878 --> 01:12:36,630
好，哪里？

不知道，但我会陪着你

1037
01:12:43,512 --> 01:12:44,638

1039
01:12:48,892 --> 01:12:51,520
警方今晚封锁了校园
We've issued a campus lock-in this evening

1040
01:12:51,645 --> 01:12:53,855
天黑后不准有人进出
No one is allowed out after dark. Okay.

1041
01:12:55,774 --> 01:12:57,359
会是谁这么做？
Who's doing this, Dewey?

1042
01:12:58,485 --> 01:12:59,778
除了卡顿还有谁？
lf not Cotton, then who?

1043

不知道，但我会找到他
l don't know, Sid but l'll find him

1044
01:13:09,454 --> 01:13:12,332
有线索吗？ 凶手会找上你吗
Any leads, Gale? Do you think the killer will come after you?

1045
01:13:12,457 --> 01:13:14,417
换你变成新闻主角感觉如何？
How does it feel to be on the other side of the news?

1046
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:17,670
卡顿，你还是嫌犯吗？
Cotton! Are you still a suspect?

1047
01:13:17,837 --> 01:13:19,255
那是天大的误会
lt's all been a huge misunderstanding

1048
01:13:19,339 --> 01:13:20,381
你正式获释了吗？
Cotton have you been officially released?

1049

盖儿，等等 拍张照吧

你还好吗？
How you holding up, Gale? lt must be scary・ ・ ・

1052
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,807
被窥伺的感觉 一定很恐怖吧！

1053
01:13:30,141 --> 01:13:30,850
你做何感想…
How does that make you feel?

1054
01:13:31,142 --> 01:13:34,729
我知道你把我 当做踏脚石
Look, local woman! l know you hold me up as your career template

1055

Let's see, for starters they impounded my van

1061

1065
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:08,596
不，你需要检查脑袋
No, you need to have your head examined

1066
01:14:22,401 --> 01:14:23,694
我觉得很惨
l feel bad, Dewey

1067
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:27,782
我觉得惨透了
l feel really bad

1068
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:33,662
我从不认为我会这么惨！
l never say that because l never feel bad about anything

1069
01:14:34,872 --> 01:14:36,498
但我现在觉得很惨
But l feel bad now

1070
01:14:41,212 --> 01:14:46,759
这是魏盖儿分身 的真情演出吗？
ls this just another brilliant Gale Weathers Performance?

1071
01:14:47,426 --> 01:14:50,721
又没人在拍我 我只是想找凶手
There's no cameras here l just want to find this fucker

等一下
Wait a minute

1078
01:15:33,346 --> 01:15:36,099
若凶手 真的无时不刻的窥伺
lf the killer really is watching and relishing every minute

1079
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,394
那他就会在带子上 对吗？
Then he would be here on these tapes, right?

1080
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,146
在每个犯罪现场
At each crime scene

1081
01:15:41,354 --> 01:15:42,480
值得看一看
lt's worth a look

1082
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:47,611
肯定值得一看
Definitely worth a look

你能撬开吗？
Can you pick it?

1088
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,396
那就是私闯
That would be breaking and entering

1089
01:16:23,563 --> 01:16:24,480
真的
No shit

1090
01:16:25,482 --> 01:16:27,609
这附近一定有录影机
There's got to be a VCR around here somewhere

1091
01:16:28,318 --> 01:16:29,235

What's in there?

1092
01:16:32,113 --> 01:16:33,156
有进展了
Now we're getting somewhere

1093
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:34,198
太好了

从这卷开始
Let's start with this one

1095
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:53,342
抱歉

弄痛你没？
Did l hurt you?

1098
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:00,349
没有
No

1099
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,293
你贪图名利，原谅我直说
You're a money hungry, fame seeking

1100
01:17:27,418 --> 01:17:29,795
也是笔法二流的作家
and forgive me for saying mediocre writer

1101
01:17:30,087 --> 01:17:32,590
而且冷酷无情
who's got a cold storage shed where her heart should be

1102
01:17:32,715 --> 01:17:34,592
别见怪
No offense intended

1103
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,430
你生气的样子很可爱
You're cute when you're angry

1104
01:17:40,306 --> 01:17:43,767
我不是有意的

1105
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,523
杜威，很抱歉
Dewey, l'm sorry

1106
01:17:51,191 --> 01:17:52,902
我从没想过伤害你

1107
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:58,490
真的
Really

01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,348
我得K书，我要交生物作业…

杜威
Dewey

1111
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,107

1112
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,443
那不是我的影片
That's not my footage

1113
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,116
去你的
Fuck you

1114
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:44,327
你再努力也当不了英雄
No matter how hard you try you'll never be the hero

1115
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:47,164
而且永远无法赢得芳心
And you'll never ever get the girl

1116
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,333
找错人了，死猪
Wrong guy, dead boy

1117
01:18:55,338 --> 01:18:56,339
别走开
Stay here

1118
01:18:56,464 --> 01:18:57,591
杜威，不要
Dewey, don't!

1119
01:19:15,442 --> 01:19:16,693
杜威
Dewey

1120
01:19:21,281 --> 01:19:22,657
那边没人
There's no one there

1121
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:22,484
操

她没关系
She's fine

1129
01:23:54,593 --> 01:23:55,844
我是她的心理医师

拜，德瑞克

你，准备受死吧

你把兄弟会的信物送人了

1136
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:09,376
好浪漫

好冷
That's cold

1139
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,572
宝贝，你爱谁？
Who do you love, baby! Sidney

1140
01:25:39,906 --> 01:25:43,409
你是说爱我们兄弟会吗

不，我说爱席妮

别问，别讲

他死了吗？
ls he dead?

怎么离开这里？

从窗子

我是无辜的受害人
l'm an innocent victim

1267

1299
01:41:13,164 --> 01:41:14,624
我跟你说会成功吧

等到法庭审判时 会更惊天动地
Wait till the trial lt's gonna rock

1301
01:41:18,127 --> 01:41:21,464
米奇，不会有审判的

1302
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,598
盖儿

一石二鸟
Two birds. One stone

1304
01:41:47,949 --> 01:41:49,116
米奇是个好孩子
Mickey was a good boy

1305
01:41:49,242 --> 01:41:51,661
他老把罪过推给电影
but my God that old blame the movies motive

1306
01:41:51,828 --> 01:41:53,788
你相信吗？

1307
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:56,457
这可怜的孩子彻底疯了
Poor boy was completely out of his mind

1308
01:41:57,166 --> 01:41:57,917
而你没有？
And you're not?

1309
01:41:58,334 --> 01:42:00,711
不，我很清醒
No. l'm very sane

1310
01:42:00,836 --> 01:42:03,672
我的动机没像米奇那么90年代
My motive isn't as nineties as Mickey

1311
01:42:04,173 --> 01:42:07,218
我是老套的复仇记
Mine is just good old fashioned revenge

1312
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:09,512
你杀了我儿子
You killed my son

1313
01:42:10,388 --> 01:42:14,392
我杀你是再合理不过的事
And now l kill you. And l can't think of anything more rational

1314
01:42:15,434 --> 01:42:17,102
你逃不过制裁的
You're never going to get away with this

1315
01:42:17,228 --> 01:42:18,437
当然会
Of course l will

1316
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,273
一切线索都追溯到米奇身上
Everything is traceable back to Mickey

1317
01:42:21,732 --> 01:42:24,235
包括他用来杀人的警察配枪
lncluding the cop-gun he used to kill everybody

1318
01:42:24,693 --> 01:42:29,532
假设你拿到另一把枪
But let's just suppose you had gotten hold of the other cop's gun

1319
01:42:29,698 --> 01:42:33,327
你追米奇，一场枪战扭打
You chased Mickey and there was a big shoot out. Big scuffle

1320
01:42:33,452 --> 01:42:36,622
你杀了米奇，米奇挂了
And you shot Mickey Killed Mickey dead

1321
01:42:38,749 --> 01:42:42,503
但他先前对你开了一枪
But not before he got off one shot at you

1322
01:42:43,921 --> 01:42:48,217
我都顾到了吗？ 有问题吗
Okay. Have l covered everything? Are there any questions?

1323
01:42:48,342 --> 01:42:49,885
你还问我意见啊！
Any comments? You know what though

1324
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:52,721
反正谁在乎
Who gives a flying fuck anyway

1325
01:42:52,888 --> 01:42:55,682
让他们去追第二个凶手
Let them try and track down the second possible killer

1326
01:42:55,849 --> 01:42:57,643
黛比索特根本不存在
Debbie Salt doesn't exist

1327
01:42:58,143 --> 01:42:59,770
你跟你儿子一样疯
You're as crazy as your son was

1328
01:43:01,146 --> 01:43:02,773
你说什么？
What did you just say?

1329
01:43:04,274 --> 01:43:09,321
那是藐视我儿子的话吗？
Was that a negative disparaging remark about my son? About my Billy!

1330
01:43:09,446 --> 01:43:10,781
不，比利是个好孩子
No, Billy was a good boy

1331
01:43:11,573 --> 01:43:14,284
比利很完美 你教得很好

1332
01:43:14,409 --> 01:43:17,162
少拍我马屁 我手中有枪
lt's not wise to patronize a woman with a gun, Sidney

1333
01:43:17,329 --> 01:43:20,290
蓝迪贬低比利 捅他真爽
Randy spoke poorly of Billy and l got a little knife happy

1334
01:43:21,374 --> 01:43:23,251

1335
01:43:23,877 --> 01:43:26,129
你知道我最恨什么吗？
You know what makes me sick

1336
01:43:27,255 --> 01:43:30,375
我恨人家说 
l'm sick to death of people saying that it's all the parent fault

1337
01:43:30,425 --> 01:43:31,635
都是父母的错
That it all starts with the family

1338
01:43:31,927 --> 01:43:34,888
如果要怪 怎么不怪你妈
Want to blame someone? Why don't you blame your mother?

1339
01:43:35,597 --> 01:43:38,516
偷走我老公 破坏我的家庭
She's the one that stole my husband And broke up my family

1340
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,520
然后你又抢走我儿子
And then you took my son

1341
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:46,608
你不知道当母亲的滋味
You don't know what it is to be a mother

1342
01:43:47,609 --> 01:43:51,446
养育孩子 教他，开导他
To raise a child To teach him! And guide him

1343
01:43:51,613 --> 01:43:52,739
遗弃他

1344
01:43:54,157 --> 01:43:55,575
米奇不是死了吗？

1345
01:46:34,149 --> 01:46:37,778
不准动，可恶

1346
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:39,446
卡顿

好，大家慢下来

你不是黛比索特对吗？
You're not Debbie Salt, are you?

1359
01:47:17,817 --> 01:47:19,569
你不是邮电报的人

1360

没错，但我还是能帮你
No, but l can still help you Cotton

1361

你不需要他 让我杀了她
You don't need her Let me killer her

1362
01:47:28,828 --> 01:47:32,290
她活着你就当不了主角
As long as she's alive, you're never going to be the lead story

1363
01:47:32,373 --> 01:47:34,459
那是你要的，不是吗？

01:47:46,429 --> 01:47:49,140
她害你坐了一年牢
She sent you to prison for a year

1367
01:47:50,183 --> 01:47:52,226
听起来很顺耳吧

1368
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:03,821
卡顿，别听她的
No, Cotton, don't you listen to her

1369
01:48:07,241 --> 01:48:10,244
很难做决定，不是吗？
lt's quite a predicament here isn't it, Sid?

1370
01:48:10,453 --> 01:48:11,370
卡顿
Cotton

1371
01:48:11,495 --> 01:48:12,747
她说得很有理
l mean she makes a good point

1372
01:48:14,165 --> 01:48:18,669
我会考虑，也许你也该考虑
Let me think about this. Maybe you should too. l will bet you that・ ・ ・

1373
01:48:18,836 --> 01:48:21,464
我敢说黛安索而访问 有希望了
Diane Sawyer interview is looking real good right about now

1374
01:48:37,646 --> 01:48:39,064
没问题
Consider it done

1375
01:49:01,879 --> 01:49:04,882
好险
That was intense

1376
01:49:17,102 --> 01:49:18,312
嘿，席妮
Hey, Sidney・ ・ ・

1377
01:49:19,229 --> 01:49:23,191
我绝不会做出伤害你的事
l want you to know that l would never ever do anything to hurt you

1378
01:49:23,608 --> 01:49:24,776
卡顿，枪给我
Cotton, give me the gun

1379
01:49:29,072 --> 01:49:31,742
好，当然，拿去
Yeah. Okay. Sure. Take it

1380
01:49:33,785 --> 01:49:40,250
我们或许应该谈谈事发经过
Sidney, we should probably talk about what exactly happened here Get our stories straight?

1381
01:49:43,462 --> 01:49:44,796
谁来拉我上去
Can somebody get me out of here

1382
01:49:45,505 --> 01:49:47,716
盖儿，你还好吧？
Gale. Are you alright?

1383
01:49:47,841 --> 01:49:49,509
我中枪了，当然不好
l've been shot, of course not

1384
01:49:51,636 --> 01:49:52,554
手给我
Give me your hand, Gale

1385
01:49:52,679 --> 01:49:55,056
天哪，你吓死我了
Jesus Gale, you scared the crap out of me

1386
01:49:55,307 --> 01:49:56,516
下面没人了吧
There isn't anybody else down there is there?

1387
01:49:56,641 --> 01:49:57,475
没有
No

1388
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:00,770
在跌落舞台报导到此为止
So much for reporting from the trenches, huh?

1389
01:50:01,396 --> 01:50:02,272
闭嘴
Shut up, Cotton

1390
01:50:03,523 --> 01:50:04,441
严不严重？
How bad is it?

1391
01:50:05,316 --> 01:50:06,860
子弹从我的肋骨弹开了
Bounced off my rib

1392
01:50:07,318 --> 01:50:09,320
天哪，你的命比猫还长
Jees, Gale you have more lives than a cat

1393
01:50:16,911 --> 01:50:17,871
给我一把枪
Give me one of those?

1394
01:50:20,832 --> 01:50:21,791
她死了吗？
ls she dead?

1395
01:50:22,667 --> 01:50:25,795
不知道，他们常会复活
l don't know. They always come back

1396
01:50:55,324 --> 01:50:56,701
以防万一
Just in case

1397
01:51:06,878 --> 01:51:07,712
差不多了，警长
That about wraps it up, Chief

1398
01:51:07,878 --> 01:51:08,504
好
Okay, Frank

1399
01:51:08,671 --> 01:51:11,340
轻点，断了几根肋骨
Take it easy, you've got a couple broken ribs there

1400
01:51:16,387 --> 01:51:17,555
盖儿，你没事吧
Gale. You alright?

1401
01:51:18,514 --> 01:51:19,348
乔
Joel?

1402
01:51:19,515 --> 01:51:20,891
我回来了
l'm back

1403
01:51:21,392 --> 01:51:23,728
我想我们或许能抢个独家
l was thinking maybe we could get the scoop like in the old days

1404
01:51:25,604 --> 01:51:28,607
魏盖儿在温莎大学报导
You're Gale Weathers at Windsor College

1405
01:51:29,316 --> 01:51:30,734
这边有个人还活着
We have a live one here

1406
01:51:37,741 --> 01:51:38,617
杜威
Dewey

1407
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,540
我不敢相信你活着
l can't believe you are alive

1408
01:51:45,582 --> 01:51:46,417
没事吧
Are you okay?

1409
01:51:46,584 --> 01:51:47,543
盖儿
Gale

1410
01:51:48,252 --> 01:51:49,295
你撑着点
You hang in there

1411
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,599
我跟你去
l'm coming with you

1412
01:52:10,232 --> 01:52:11,108
告诉我们你看到什么
Can you tell us what you saw?

1413
01:52:11,233 --> 01:52:12,150
里面发生了什么事
Can you tell us what happened in there?

1414
01:52:12,276 --> 01:52:14,278
席妮，请谈谈当英雄的感受
Sidney, can you tell us how it feels to be a hero?

1415
01:52:18,782 --> 01:52:19,741
他才是英雄，卡顿
Talk to Cotton

1416
01:52:21,451 --> 01:52:24,580
他才是采访对象，他是英雄
He's the man you want to interview He's the hero

1417
01:52:31,294 --> 01:52:33,588
发生什么事？ 为何你是英雄
What happened in there? Why are you a hero?

1418
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:39,761
请说细节
Details, please

1419
01:52:39,928 --> 01:52:42,514
没人比我更想提供这个故事
Look guys, no one wants to give you this story more than l do

1420
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:46,726
可惜要看时间地点和价码
Unfortunately, there's time and a place. lndeed a price for everything

1421
01:52:46,852 --> 01:52:48,311
随时打给我
So feel free to call me

1422

卡顿，说一点嘛
