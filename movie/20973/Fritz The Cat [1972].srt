1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:12,080
(BINGOWINGZ)

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,440
Hey, yeah. The 1960's?

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,360
Happy times, heavy times.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,600
All right, so you get
your daughter, right?

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,880
She might be Catholic,
Jewish, anything.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,480
So you bring her up
in what they call...

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,360
the bourgeois,
American-type-society family.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,160
Bring them up so they don't
screw until they get married.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,600
You take them to church
on Sunday.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,000
Teach them all you can
about bringing up a family...

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
how you should look and act...

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,800
then you send them to college.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,040
You bust your hump.
No government subsidy.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,280
Nobody's paying nothing.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
You save your money,
or you borrow the money...

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,320
you work overtime,
you send her to college.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,680
You want her
to get an education.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
The first Easter
she comes home on a vacation...

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,360
she says, "Hey, Dad,
I'm living with some guy."

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,440
"You're living with some guy?
What do you mean?"

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,800
"This is the thing now.
Free love."

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,880
We're getting away
from the original point.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,240
What we're trying to find is,
why are these bastards rioting?

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,640
Because they did dope.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,760
Listen, you're going
in the wrong direction.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,320
What of it?

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,920
What happens is, look,
I'm sending you to school...

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,160
I'm breaking my ass to send you
to college, right?

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,760
I expect you're going
to learn something.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,240
Why be a janitor?
Learn something.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,560
To justify my investment in you.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,560
But some of these people
revel in the fact...

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,000
that their kids are leaders,
are rabble-rousers.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,880
This son of a bitch
just started a riot.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,840
These kids think
they're the first generation...

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,640
that ever screwed
before they got married.

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,280
We all did,
but we always had one girl.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,800
She screwed...
that girl you took out.

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,680
It's better off
these kids don't get married...

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,720
because they haven't got
the guts to stick with it.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,560
Hey, you fucking intellectuals

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,280
You think
you're so where it's at

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,600
Before you fill your minds
with any junk

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,960
Better listen to Fritz the Cat

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,600
'Cause writers and poets
and artists

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
It's your duty
to live life to the most

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,440
So fly out, brothers,
and check out the world

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,720
Give me a ride to the coast

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Fritz the Cat

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
He fought many a good man

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
Laid many a good woman

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Live life to the fullest

53
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,320
Cry out for more
until it bleeds

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,560
Help me,
help me help you, mother...

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,160
Love me,
I hate you, love me

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,320
I kill you, love me

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
I love you

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,520
What a mob in the park today.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,440
God, the place
is crawling with phonies.

60
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Yeah, high school punks.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Those creeps are always here
on weekends, man.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,840
Most of them are total jackoffs.

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,960
So many people here
and nobody here.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,120
-Dig that chick, man!
-Over there?

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,040
Man, look at that ass on her!

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
-What a baby carriage.
-So what, man?

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,080
If you hadn't showed up so late,
we'd be all right now.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
Fritz always does it, man.

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,320
Everybody's here with
their guitars already.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,640
Sixteen versions
of "Lemon Tree."

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,040
I just want someplace
where I can sleep.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,560
I mean, I can cook.

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,520
I can sew and do housework
and things like that.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
Get out the guitars.

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,720
Come on, get them out.

76
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,640
And one, two, three.

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,800
Once I had a little girl

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,240
Who was in love with me

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,360
Well, well, baby,
I know, I know

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,560
Oh, mama, mama,
singing it, ho

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,600
Dumb chicks.

83
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,040
-Easily impressed by spades.
-lt's the thing, man.

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
Look, I'm gonna split.

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,160
I'll see you guys later.

86
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,920
Yeah, hang loose, Fritz.

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I've read everything
James Baldwin's written.

88
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,040
He has a true sense of
the problems of black people.

89
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,000
I worked for Head Start
for free last summer.

90
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,840
Black kids
are so much groovier.

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
I went to a couple of
Black Panther meetings.

92
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,080
The time for
non-violent revolution is past.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
More power to the people!

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm taking a course
in African studies at school.

95
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,240
I had no idea you people
were so civilized.

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Do you know
that property values...

97
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,240
actually go up when
a black family moves in?

98
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,040
Freud didn't write
for the black man.

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,440
Why does a great actor
like James Earl Jones...

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
always have to play black men?

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,200
Don't you hate it when people
say "Colored" or "Negro"...

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,760
and not "Black"?
Black is beautiful.

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,360
It's so great that black people
wear their hair natural...

104
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,120
not emulating
the image of beauty...

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,520
white people inflict upon them.

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,920
I had a black girlfriend once
who said that Jewish people...

107
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,080
were the closest
to black people.

108
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,120
I'm Jewish, you know.

109
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,680
I ain't no jive-ass
black nigger, honey.

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,320
Who do you think I am?
Geraldine?

111
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, God!

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,520
Oh, Jesus!

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,760
How awful.

114
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,960
My soul is tormented.

115
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
-Gee.
-Oh, no.

116
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,840
I've been up and down the four
corners of this big old world.

117
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,360
I've seen it all!
I've done it all!

118
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,680
-Gee.
-Wow.

119
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,200
I've fought many a good man,
laid many a good woman.

120
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,920
I've had riches and fame
and adventure.

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,040
Stood face to face with danger
and death countless times.

122
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,320
Are you somebody famous?

123
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,040
I think I saw you
in a movie once.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,880
Try not to interrupt, huh?

125
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,960
I've tasted life
to the fullest...

126
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
and still my soul cries out...

127
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,040
in this hungry, tortured,
wrecked quest, "More!"

128
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,320
-Look at the good side of life.
-Things aren't all bad.

129
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,840
Gee, he's handsome.

130
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,000
You. You can help me.

131
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,240
You must save me.

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,000
By so doing, you, too,
will be saved.

133
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I'd like to, but what can I do?

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,120
Lovely set of eyes there.

135
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,160
Little sweet one
with your heart of gold...

136
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
I know of a place
where we can be alone...

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,840
to join our souls
in sacred truth.

138
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,080
I want to be in on this thing.

139
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
What about my soul,
you fink?

140
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,240
Four in bed...that's a kick
I haven't tried yet.

141
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,760
What?

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Yes. Together
we shall all learn...

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
the real existential essence
of the life force.

144
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
"Existential."
I heard that word once.

145
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,200
-What's it mean?
-"Cool," stupid.

146
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,560
You are a true genius, Fritz.

147
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Wild, this is wild.

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh, honey, I could go...

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,360
I'll get it. God damn it.

150
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,200
What's happening, man?

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,920
Fritz the Cat has become
the stud of the year.

152
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,320
We're having a session here now,
so I don't know.

153
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,680
Anybody using that room?

154
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,400
That's the john,
I mean...

155
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,400
if you're really
strung out, man.

156
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
We'll take it.
This way, group.

157
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Come along, now,
step lively.

158
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,800
Watch your step.

159
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,240
That's a girl.
Rub-a-dub-a-dub.

160
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
OK.

161
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,840
A new world of experience
awaits us, my loves.

162
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
This bathtub
is now transformed...

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
into a space capsule
of truth and love.

164
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,160
Wow! This is wild!

165
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,480
Only in naked closeness
can we all know each other.

166
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,880
Yes! Right!
Very good, Winston, darling.

167
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,880
"Naked closeness," true.
You are a perceptive girl.

168
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,680
Closeness,
we must all get very close...

169
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,760
as close as possible,
as a matter of fact.

170
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,800
That's right.
Let's all get close together.

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
Oh, boy.

172
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,680
Closeness and fulfillment
of our hidden desires...

173
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,440
through which
we reach the truth.

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,080
Fulfillment is important.
Don't you think so, Winston?

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Ooh, yes.
Very important.

176
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
Now I'm getting to the truth,
I think, yes.

177
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,600
It's all very clear now.

178
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,360
OK, Winston.
Here come the truth.

179
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,480
You got the word.
Oh, Fritzy.

180
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
You got such
an existential little body.

181
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,840
Jeez. Wow.

182
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,840
Oh, shit!
Maybe we better go, huh?

183
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,840
No! Not at all!
You get down over here.

184
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,720
And you down like that.
Right under here.

185
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,680
Watch the foot.

186
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,840
Right under here.

187
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,720
Ready, everyone.
Here we go.

188
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,960
Hey, Ralph,
I think this is the place...

189
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,120
we got the report on
with these kids upstairs...

190
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
doing the shit and smoking,
I think.

191
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,600
Tell me what to do.
I never went in before.

192
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,080
Because you're a rookie
and this is your first beat...

193
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,960
you just follow me.
We walk up the steps.

194
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,240
We don't make any noise.

195
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
You follow me slowly, got that?

196
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,080
I do. Like Dick Tracy.

197
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
No, it's like
Terry and the Pirates.

198
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,280
Dick Tracy's old hat.

199
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,840
Now, let's go inside.

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,080
Wait. Could I get
to search the girls?

201
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,480
Yeah.
I've done enough of that.

202
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,400
Here we go.

203
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,560
And watch me,
'cause I'm a natural in action.

204
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,760
Up the steps.

205
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,160
Hey, man.

206
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,720
What the hell's
going on in here?

207
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,680
For Christ's sake,
what do you want?

208
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
For Christ's sake...

209
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,680
Fritz is having his own
private little orgy.

210
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,320
Move over, man.

211
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,920
Will you get out of here?
We're seeking the truth!

212
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
It's my bathtub, man.

213
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't pay attention
to that Fritz.

214
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,840
He got a Jesus complex.

215
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh, I know it.

216
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,320
Have some joy puff,
sweet little bird.

217
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,720
Hello, New York.

218
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
Heard you're having
a hash session here.

219
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,360
Wow, this is where it's at.

220
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,240
Yes, man, come join us.

221
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,320
Good stuff and lots of it, man.

222
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,960
Only close the door.
We're modest.

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,680
Har har har.
The guy's a riot.

224
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,120
Oh, God, I'm there.

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,680
You really there?
How is it?

226
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,800
-lt's...
-How is it?

227
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,840
That's funny.
I'm not there anymore.

228
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,680
Oh, shit.

229
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm a writer.
Let's talk about it.

230
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,760
Ever made it
with an aardvark before?

231
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,280
It's a rare opportunity.
We're scarce.

232
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,480
Really?

233
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,400
I can't tell
if I'm there or not.

234
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,640
How do you tell?

235
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,320
You'll know when you are.

236
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,160
Oh, balls.
lt doesn't work for me.

237
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm a failure
as a pot smoker.

238
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,840
Don't be sad.

239
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,120
Someday you'll make it.
Really.

240
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,480
Shh. I think we're here.

241
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,720
Do you hear anything, Ralph?

242
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,280
It sounds like a bunch
of degenerates in there.

243
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,600
Now, listen, Ralph,
you got the deeper voice.

244
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,520
And I want you to yell,
"Open the fucking door."

245
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,320
Say the word "Fucking" because
that makes you sound tough.

246
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,480
When I say three,
you yell, "Open..."

247
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm even gonna ad-lib.

248
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,040
No ad-libbing, Ralph.

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,880
Let me call them pre-verts.

250
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,920
What's a pre-vert?

251
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,680
A pre-vert is a degenerate,
didn't you know that?

252
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
A pre-vert's a degenerate?

253
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,480
Didn't you have no bringing up?

254
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,280
I got bar-mitzvahed.

255
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,120
You ain't supposed
to laugh, Ralph!

256
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,720
This is a serious job
and we're getting paid for it.

257
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,960
Cut the fucking shit out.

258
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,000
Let's go.

259
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
All right.

260
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,640
Open up in there!
It's the law! Hippie bastards!

261
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,960
Good, Ralph, do it again.

262
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,400
What the fuck's your problem?
Cut it out!

263
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,520
I won't laugh!

264
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Open the door, you pre-verts!

265
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,280
Open up!
Law and order's here!

266
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,600
-Open up!
-All right in there!

267
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,000
Open up! Here we are!

268
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Wow! I can do it!

269
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,400
Oh, baby, do I feel high!

270
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm flying!

271
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,400
What a wonderful, wiggly world!

272
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,120
We're outside,
but we'll get in!

273
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,080
-Law and order's here!
-Open up!

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,440
All right in there!

275
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,560
Your fucking bath party's over!

276
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,040
-Over here!
-The cops!

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
Right in the mouth!
Yeah! I love it!

278
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,400
Take that!

279
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Hey, you!
Get your hands out of my thing!

280
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,600
-Here we are!
-Where the fuck are you?

281
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,880
Over there! ln the head!

282
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,520
Get your hands
off of my dick!

283
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,640
In the head!

284
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,520
I love it! I love it!
Ralph, where are you?

285
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,480
Ralph, help! Gotcha!

286
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Now I gotcha!
Here, take that!

287
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,200
That's my...

288
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Gotcha! ln the heart!
In the head!

289
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,400
Over there!
Watch that thing!

290
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,440
Where's the cat?

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,480
Wow.

292
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,680
Hey, look at
this big fucking gun.

293
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,920
I killed the john!

294
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,760
Kill! Destroy!

295
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,400
Can you give him your glasses?

296
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,680
Because I can't.
I have to look.

297
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,720
-You can't see?
-l'll give them back.

298
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,200
A little bit...

299
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,920
Oh, boy, this is good for me.

300
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
Can you dig it in your eyes?

301
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,000
You're younger than me.
Forty-five, forty-eight.

302
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm sixty-seven.

303
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,840
I wish I knew.
I would give you glasses.

304
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,560
I'd take another pair
from the house.

305
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,160
I didn't think
I would need the glasses.

306
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,600
I'm not so young no more,
remember.

307
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,600
You don't see nothing?

308
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,400
I'm older than you are,
I'll see.

309
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,600
I'll mention that I see.

310
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,920
You're doing fine.

311
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,120
You're doing fine.
You know something?

312
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,760
That you don't have to
look at the book, right?

313
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,480
So say it. Say it.

314
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,440
All right.

315
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,160
All right. Good.

316
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,760
-Good.
-Beautiful.

317
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,160
Thank you, thank you.

318
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,920
Just normal.
You know, nice and quiet.

319
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,480
Now, wait a minute.
Don't rush.

320
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,840
Mother of God,
I'm a fucking fugitive.

321
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,640
This is the place!
I saw him come in here!

322
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,320
Oh, my God, it's a synagogue.

323
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
What kind of a place is this?
A church?

324
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,000
Listen, I can hear them.
Don't sound like English.

325
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
Are they Puerto Ricans?

326
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,520
Ralph,
you're trying my patience.

327
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,080
You go down that aisle,
I'll go down this aisle.

328
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,640
It's about time
you said something bright.

329
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,840
Ralph, please be quiet.
It's my people.

330
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,240
-Excuse me, Rabbi.
-They all got long hair.

331
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,760
-Sorry, Rabbi.
-They all got long clothes.

332
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,520
-Excuse me.
-Must be a hippie church.

333
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,480
Hi, Rabbi.

334
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,040
Did you see him?

335
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
God.

336
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,720
Ralph,
would you please shut up?

337
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
I ain't talking loud.

338
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,200
Excuse me, Rabbi.

339
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,360
Hi, Ma.
Excuse me, Rabbi.

340
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,840
Uncle Ben, how are you?
I'm catching a criminal.

341
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,080
Excuse me, Rabb...
It's you.

342
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,400
Did you find him?

343
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,480
No, he was over there, but...

344
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,400
-But I was just telling you...
-Cut it out!

345
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,800
But I was just...
I ain't talking loud!

346
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,520
What are you doing?

347
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,080
What's going on here?

348
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,440
You saved my life!

349
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,680
We interrupt
the lsraeli-Arab war...

350
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,280
for this special announcement.

351
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,960
The president,
after conferring...

352
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,440
with the lsraeli
prime minister Golda Meir...

353
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,320
has agreed to send more arms
and equipment to lsrael...

354
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,720
based on the return of
New York City and Los Angeles...

355
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,840
to the United States.

356
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,320
Mazel tov! Mazel tov!

357
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,440
Stop, you motherfucking cat!

358
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,120
Stop in the name of the law!

359
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,960
Stop!

360
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,680
Stupid, Ralph,
you're not supposed to dance.

361
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,120
But I didn't want
to break the circle!

362
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,040
-You're not supposed to dance.
-l got musical feet.

363
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
You dumb rookie.
Dumb rookie!

364
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,800
You dumb rookie!

365
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,200
Dumb rookie!

366
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,440
You're not supposed
to dance, Ralph...

367
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
'cause you're not Jewish!

368
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,200
I had a great thing going till
the frigging fuzz showed up.

369
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,440
I wish that skinny broad
didn't turn on the shower, too.

370
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,960
I think I'm getting a cold.

371
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
Hello, men. Everybody studying
for their goddamn exams?

372
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,560
Hey, Buzz, how'd it go
with that Dee-Dee chick?

373
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,320
She's got some bod,
you have to admit.

374
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,560
Charlene isn't bad,
either, though, right?

375
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,080
Like wow!

376
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,400
Hines!
You swine, old buddy pig!

377
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,080
You groove behind Alvina,
get some kicks tonight?

378
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,440
Bastards.
You'd think the goddamn exams...

379
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,920
was the be-all and end-all
of existence...

380
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,360
cosmic life force
or something.

381
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,120
You'd think they were
the frigging fugitives.

382
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Can't even get in
a few decent words to a guy.

383
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Bastards.

384
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,480
What a bore,
they just sit there...

385
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,960
and take bennies
and stay up all night...

386
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,240
with their face stuck
in a bunch of books...

387
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
and their thumb up their ass.

388
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,680
Yes, yes,
I remember the time...

389
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,200
when it was all very inspiring
and enlightening...

390
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,880
all this history and literature
and sociology shit.

391
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,080
You think learning
is a really big thing...

392
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,000
and you become
this big fucking intellectual...

393
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,040
and sit around trying
to out-intellectual...

394
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,160
all the other big
fucking intellectuals.

395
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,800
You spend years and years...

396
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,160
with your nose buried
in these goddamn tomes...

397
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,680
while the world
is passing you by.

398
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,360
All the stuff to see...

399
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,000
and all the kicks...

400
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,120
and all the girls
are out there.

401
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
And me, a writer!

402
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,360
And a poet who should be
having adventures...

403
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,160
and experiencing
all the diversities...

404
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,480
and paradoxes
and ironies of life...

405
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,520
and passing over
all the roads of the world!

406
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,160
And digging all the cities
and towns and rivers...

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,480
and the oceans and...

408
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,520
making all of them chicks.

409
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,080
Oh, God.

410
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,040
As a writer and a poet...

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,720
it is my duty to get out there
and dig the world...

412
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,720
to swim in
the whole frigging scene...

413
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,240
while there is
still time, man.

414
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,360
My farting around days
are over, baby.

415
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,520
From this day on, I shall live
every day as if it was my last.

416
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,800
I must do it!

417
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,600
No more of the dreary,
boring classes...

418
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,600
dismal lectures,
sitting around bullshitting..

419
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,320
with pretentious
fat-ass hippies.

420
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,360
No more of the books...

421
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,600
the spoutings of
a bunch of old farts...

422
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,720
who think they know
the whole goddamn score.

423
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,240
Oh, my God, what have I done?

424
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,640
I set all my notes
and books on fire...

425
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,040
and now I can't study
for my exams.

426
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,200
I'll flunk out,
and my folks will be pissed off.

427
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,520
I'll get a blanket.

428
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,120
The blanket's on fire.

429
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,000
We better call
the fire department.

430
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,600
Bo Diddley buy his baby
a diamond ring

431
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,000
If that diamond ring
don't shine

432
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,360
He gonna take it
to a private eye

433
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,640
If that private eye
can't see

434
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,080
He better not take
that ring from me

435
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,600
Bo Diddley caught him
a nanny goat

436
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,720
To make his pretty baby
a Sunday coat

437
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,080
Bo Diddley caught him
a bear cat

438
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,360
To make his pretty baby
a Sunday hat

439
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
Maybe someday

440
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,040
You will fall in love

441
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,480
As I fell in love with you

442
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,360
Baby

443
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
The one you love

444
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,320
Just keep falling in love
with you

445
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,680
Then when

446
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,680
You all alone

447
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,480
You know it'd be best, baby

448
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,440
You can sing like that.

449
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,760
Little coquette, I love you

450
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,280
Sing, 'cause I want to...
if I get tired, I quit.

451
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
But you don't want to sing.

452
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,040
I want to sing, man.
I'm good.

453
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,560
You sing as good as you want.

454
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
If I get tired, I quit.

455
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,040
I went to school in Oakland...

456
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,920
and I had quite a few white-type
of school kids with me.

457
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,880
I'm forty-nine.

458
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,760
At that time, I had white kids
going to school with me.

459
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,120
I would have peanut butter.

460
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,000
I don't want it...

461
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,520
but I ate so much when
my mother gave it to me.

462
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,200
With apple butter.

463
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,600
I got two cans of it now.

464
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,840
That I don't eat because...

465
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,640
whitey was eating
ham sandwiches...

466
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
and I was eating
peanut butter sandwiches.

467
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,840
Sandwiches!

468
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
I got to get out of this town
for some Southern times.

469
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,560
Let me out of here.
That's right.

470
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
Suck! The bus only cost
$17 to New York.

471
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,440
I say, "l ain't made
$17 in two weeks."

472
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Got air to live.

473
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,560
Riding a ship
coming out of Pearl Harbor.

474
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,360
And all my white friends...

475
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,000
then we drank water
out of the ditches.

476
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,760
If I had a K-ration,
I gave them some of it.

477
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,960
And...

478
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,080
I would ride this bus.

479
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,040
I couldn't sit with my friend
on this bus at Houston, Texas.

480
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,320
I had to ride
at the back end of this bus.

481
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,960
I'm about to get hot now.
As a matter of fact...

482
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,960
you couldn't even go no place
down South riding a bus.

483
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,960
Couldn't even get a soda...

484
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,160
walk in there
and get you a sandwich.

485
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,800
I don't give a damn
about who's racist.

486
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,200
I just want equality.

487
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,760
Be equal with the next guy,
because I'm paying my taxes.

488
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,400
That's a different thing now.

489
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,280
I'm a working man,
and I'm paying my taxes.

490
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,840
The money is what's happening.

491
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,040
See what I mean?

492
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It all counts...
when is what's happening.

493
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,280
I'm talking about...

494
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,320
If you want
to be revolutionary...

495
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,200
you get some bread first,
and then you can talk trash.

496
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,880
Whitey blind us with religion.

497
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,040
If you fight
violence with violence...

498
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,080
like the late Malcolm did,
you'll get some results.

499
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,040
Right.

500
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,520
Because before
this rioting and shit...

501
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,400
you didn't have
no Head Start programs for kids.

502
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,320
You didn't have shit!
Really.

503
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,960
You didn't have
a goddamn thing.

504
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,960
Got you down in Harlem
selling horsemeat.

505
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,520
You know,
if one of them motherfuckers...

506
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,360
down and out selling
horsemeat, they dead.

507
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,120
Another civil war.

508
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,160
Civil war.

509
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,080
And I'm gonna be
standing back...

510
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,440
"Get 'em, baby!"

511
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,400
Hey, man, you in a bag?

512
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,240
Yeah, that's it.
I'm in a bag.

513
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,240
Just don't lose
your coolness, cat...

514
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,120
I mean,
don't lose your coolness.

515
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,000
Easy for you to talk.
You're a crow.

516
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,880
I wish I was a crow.

517
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,520
If I was a crow,
I'd fly away, man.

518
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,480
I'd fly away from
this miserable town for good.

519
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,840
You think being a crow
is a big motherfucking ball?

520
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,800
All you cats the same, man.

521
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,440
You don't know where it is.

522
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,120
There's nobody to tell you
where it's at.

523
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,240
And you come up here,
try to find out where it's at...

524
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,560
but you got to be up here, man,
to find out what's happening.

525
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,000
I know it isn't a ball, man.

526
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,600
I studied the race problems.
I know.

527
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,440
You don't know nothing
about the race problem.

528
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,280
Got to be a crow to know
about the race problem.

529
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,880
You know what I mean?
Do you dig where I'm at?

530
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,960
You know what I'm talking about?

531
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,760
Man, this thing affects me
very deeply, fella.

532
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
As a cat, I have
a considerable guilt complex...

533
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,680
because my kind have always
brought suffering on your kind.

534
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,160
Yes, indeed, my soul
is tortured and tormented...

535
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,240
by this racial crisis.

536
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,840
No shit?

537
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,040
I kid you not, man.

538
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,280
Sometimes I really get
hung up about it.

539
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,880
You know, uptight.

540
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,360
-Strung out.
-ln a bag?

541
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Yeah, in a bag!

542
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,800
I'm gonna buy you a drink, cat.

543
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,720
Just 'cause I think
you got coolness.

544
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Great.
Hey, boy, can I have a drink?

545
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,160
Oh, man!

546
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,320
Hey, Duke!

547
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,800
Hey, Duke!

548
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,640
They's blowing pot like mad
up in Mildred's pad!

549
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,920
I'm on my way, man.

550
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,080
Hey, cat, how would you
like to bug out now?

551
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,920
By God, man!
I'm gonna bug out!

552
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,360
Did he say bug out, baby?

553
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,520
Go ahead, baby, bug out.

554
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,920
Ain't no bug out.

555
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,640
-What kind of shit is that?
-lt's a bug out to him.

556
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,760
-lt's some kind of dance.
-Let's split.

557
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,480
Anybody looking our way?

558
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,520
Some stud
gone and left his keys.

559
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,760
What are you doing?

560
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,520
You stealing that car?

561
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,600
Shove over, Jack!
Let me drive this goddamn thing.

562
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,560
Move it out!

563
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Hey, man,
you cats can't drive.

564
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,920
You don't know nothing
about nothing.

565
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,960
Can't you see that car go by?

566
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,440
Cool it, will you?
I drive like a crow.

567
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,720
-Man, look, slow down!
-l see the light.

568
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,240
Man, you'll get killed up here!

569
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,400
Bullshit, Ralph!
Would you please shut up?

570
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,520
It's bad enough
we got transferred up here...

571
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,880
without you bullshitting
all night.

572
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,720
Now, I gotta cover my beat...

573
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,840
and I'll meet you
back here in an hour.

574
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,480
One hour, Ralph.
And, Ralph...

575
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,960
please, be careful.

576
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,360
Yeah, but Harlem?

577
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,160
Come on, slow the car down!

578
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,160
Look out, man!
I ain't ready to die yet!

579
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,800
Harlem?

580
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
I know what I'm doing.

581
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,960
The only faces...

582
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,520
you can see in a crowd
up here is ours.

583
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,360
The way they look,
all you can see is their eyes.

584
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,760
I don't like it here.

585
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,320
I see the fucking fuzz.

586
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,600
Cool it, just cool it.

587
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,400
Right through the head
I'm gonna get you!

588
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,760
Throw that pig out!

589
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,480
Look out!

590
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,920
Cool it, man, will you?

591
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,080
I know what I'm doing.

592
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,040
Like hell you do.

593
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,560
Duke, you saved my life, man!

594
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,640
Shit!

595
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:21,080
Yesterdays

596
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,280
Yesterdays

597
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,240
Days I knew as happy sweet

598
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,200
Sequestered days

599
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,240
Olden days

600
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,120
Golden days

601
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,280
Days of mad romance

602
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,120
And love

603
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,560
Then gay youth was mine

604
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,600
And truth was mine

605
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,160
Joyous free and flaming life

606
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,640
Them-sooth was mine

607
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,840
Sad am l

608
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,440
Glad am l

609
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,560
For today

610
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,120
I'm dreaming of

611
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,120
Yesterdays

612
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,240
That you, Sonny?

613
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,240
It's me, baby.

614
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,200
-How's the crowd tonight?
-Not bad.

615
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,640
We're pushing enough grass
to make our money.

616
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,800
Just enough.

617
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,720
But it sure ain't like
the good old days in Harlem...

618
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,040
when white money was boss...

619
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,400
and them fine, white cats
came up to Harlem...

620
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,200
spreading it all around
Big Bertha.

621
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,680
Oh, child.

622
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,160
That was before
all those peace marches...

623
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,880
sit-ins, riots, and 'dos.

624
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,960
Ain't nothing wrong
with no peace marches.

625
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,280
It's me, baby.

626
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,240
Who's that joker?

627
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,920
Friend of mine.

628
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,920
Cat, you ever been high on pot?

629
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Are you kidding me, man?
Grass?

630
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,560
Who doesn't, you know?

631
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,920
What do you think,
I'm some kind of a hick?

632
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,400
Let's get that cat going on pot!

633
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,640
Take one.

634
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,920
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.

635
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,640
Nothing wrong, take two.

636
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,960
Come on, be a club member.
That's it!

637
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,440
Take three! Take four!

638
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,960
Five, six, seven!
That's it, baby!

639
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,560
He ain't losing now,
no, indeed.

640
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,440
Joint, Hilly! A joint!

641
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,560
Stay loose!

642
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,280
Fritz, come on, now, stop!

643
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,680
Yo, Fritz!

644
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,360
Fritz, come on, now,
stop it!

645
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,760
No, don't stop! Oh, yeah!

646
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,720
Oh, no, Fritz! Come on!

647
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,920
Hey, toro!

648
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,000
Hully gully cat!

649
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,440
Climb, sugar!

650
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,880
Right there! No, Fritz!
Come on, Fritz!

651
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,800
Aw, man, yeah!

652
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,840
Will you look at that?

653
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,400
You ain't black enough, hon.

654
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,200
That old black magic got me!

655
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,960
Oh, Fritz! That's right!

656
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,600
Right there, honey!

657
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,640
Wow, wow, wow!
Pump that thing!

658
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,280
Suddenly it's all very clear!

659
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,040
I must tell the people
about the revolution!

660
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,880
Revolt! Revolt!

661
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,400
Damn you! What the hell
you jabbering about now?

662
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,560
Revolt!

663
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,280
Revolt! Revolt!

664
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,800
Revolt,
you thick-skulled idiots!

665
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,320
You have carried heavy burdens
for the bosses!

666
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,320
You have sweat your lives away
for the bosses!

667
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,840
The bosses!
They ride around in limousines!

668
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,160
Get the fuck off my car!

669
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,160
Bosses...they're eating
strawberries and cream !

670
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,440
That's funny!
Cats are real boss!

671
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,600
All right,
what's going on here?

672
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,320
Break it up!

673
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,280
Cool it, officer.
He's just blowing hot air.

674
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,720
No one's paying no mind.

675
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,240
Come the revolution,
there'll be no more limousines!

676
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:45,000
Come the revolution,
no more strawberries and cream !

677
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,320
Hey, Ralph, you know how
these dumb kids are.

678
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,520
They don't know what they doing.

679
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,240
Fucking "A" right.

680
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,160
There he is!

681
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,600
He's the one who keeps
the bosses in power!

682
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,840
He's the one
who's holding you down!

683
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,240
-Who, me?
-You!

684
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,400
-Not me. You.
-No, you!

685
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,400
-Me?!
-Not me!

686
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,640
You!

687
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,440
-Fuck you!
-You first!

688
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,000
The spiked Buddha Capitalism !

689
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,360
The iron thumb on the heads
of the proletariat!

690
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,800
They're gonna kill us.

691
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,600
Would you like to see
a picture of my kids?

692
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,440
Come on, man!
You'll get killed up here!

693
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,360
Get them, get them !

694
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,680
Kill them !

695
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,320
We shall overcome!

696
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,400
Group Commander to Formation B.

697
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,240
Don't give them
a chance to scatter.

698
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,880
Attack all congested areas.

699
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,200
I've got to find him.

700
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,800
Where could he be?

701
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,320
This is the alley behind
that place he was standing at.

702
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,160
It gives me the creeps.

703
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,240
Good evening, madam.

704
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,800
Oh, Fritz!
Thank God I found you.

705
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,280
Join me, Winston, my love.

706
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,800
It's not very pretty looking,
but it's cozy as a bitch.

707
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,320
Fritz, come out of there,
will you please?

708
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,480
The hell! With the fuzz
combing the city for me?

709
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,600
Has my picture
appeared on TV yet?

710
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,440
Have they broadcast an alarm?

711
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,480
Offered a reward for information
leading to my arrest?

712
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,320
Don't be so melodramatic.

713
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,800
You and your illusions
of grandeur.

714
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,800
I'm not getting in that filthy,
grimy garbage can with you.

715
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,040
Go fuck yourself.

716
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,440
You're such a child.

717
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,240
Such a self-centered,
egotistical child.

718
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,720
This is disgusting.

719
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,720
If you're gonna talk about
my garbage can that way...

720
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,640
just get the hell out.

721
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,640
Fritz, are you still going
to bug out or not?

722
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,480
Are you kidding, toots?
I got no choice at this point.

723
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,040
Listen to me, will you?

724
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,320
I've got a car and some money.

725
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,160
I can get
all the things we need...

726
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,400
and we can leave right away.

727
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,160
We can go out to the coast.

728
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,280
I'll get a good job
as a private secretary...

729
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,280
and you can work
on your poetry and all.

730
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,120
We can get married and rent
a nice little pad in Frisco...

731
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,320
and dig the scene out there.

732
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,440
It's supposed
to be a great town.

733
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,960
Frisco. Yeah, OK.

734
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,240
She makes men into boys

735
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,160
She makes giants into men

736
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,560
She'll have you feeling guilty

737
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,080
Before you can count to ten

738
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,440
Poor Winston

739
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,240
Sharp mind and a body to match

740
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,400
Poor Winston

741
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,760
Fine fancy karma,
able, too, at that

742
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,640
Who is the girl
in the fiberglass shorts?

743
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,360
Well, it's got to be
Winston Schwartz

744
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,680
You can't outtalk her

745
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,480
'Cause she talks too fast

746
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,240
You can't outthink her,
she's a New York flash

747
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,360
She makes love to you
and tell you you're in love

748
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,040
You make love to her

749
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,680
She says you don't know
how to do it

750
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,280
Poor Winston

751
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,160
at last we're zooming down
that old lonesome highway.

752
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,600
It's wild.

753
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,720
Yeah. Marvelous.

754
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,960
Marvelous, my ass!

755
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,000
It's exalting. Elating.

756
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,600
The cool night wind
blowing past the window. Man!

757
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,960
I'm hungry.
Let's stop someplace.

758
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,120
The hell with stopping.

759
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,080
I just want to feel
those miles flying by.

760
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
I'm hungry!

761
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,080
Let's dig one of those
little greasy truck stops.

762
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,240
I'd like to talk with
those truck drivers, you know?

763
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,120
Hear what they got to say
about life on the road.

764
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,800
I bet they got
wild stories of the road.

765
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,560
Drivers, trucks, hijackers!

766
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,040
Fights! Let's do it.

767
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,520
Here's a good place.

768
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,160
I'll have your deluxe steak
with salad and coffee. Black.

769
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,680
All right.
What would you like, sir?

770
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,560
That was really a fine steak.

771
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,440
You can always depend
upon Howard Johnson's.

772
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,880
Let's get back on the road.

773
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,720
Goddamn.

774
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,760
Fritz! Wake up!

775
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,880
Huh? What?

776
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,880
The car is broken down...

777
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,720
and I can't get
the damned thing...

778
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,000
What? Where are we?

779
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,480
Fuck a duck.

780
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,240
We're out in the middle
of the frigging desert.

781
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,960
Jesus, it's great!

782
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,920
Exactly. You've been
sound asleep for two days.

783
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,680
-What?
-Two days.

784
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,880
You must've been dragged out
after your big binge.

785
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,680
Shit. I guess I was.

786
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,600
All that drinking and
blowing pot and screwing, man.

787
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,160
Man, I get horny
just thinking about it.

788
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,280
Like, wow!

789
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,680
Start thinking about
fixing this car, Fritz...

790
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,600
or we'll be sitting
here forever.

791
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,120
Look, is something
bugging you, pal?

792
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,480
The car won't go!

793
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,720
Well, let's have a look.

794
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,680
I knew that all the time.

795
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,640
The engine's not up here.
It's in the back.

796
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,160
Let's just check it out.

797
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,360
What's wrong?

798
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,320
Let me see, I'll just...

799
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,080
If I move that...no...

800
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,800
What's wrong, Fritz?

801
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,280
It's all very complicated,
Winston.

802
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,800
I couldn't begin
to explain it.

803
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,880
I think the piston rod's
stuck in the drive shaft.

804
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,760
Either that,
or the carburetor is rusted out.

805
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,040
Oh, good God.

806
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,760
Here comes a pickup truck.

807
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,600
Maybe he'll give us a push
to the next gas station.

808
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,840
What's the trouble, buddy?

809
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,440
Our car is busted down.

810
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,960
Could you give us a push
to the next gas station?

811
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,440
Let me look at it.

812
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,400
One thing I'm good at
is fixing things.

813
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,520
Shut up!

814
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,440
Please shut up, chickens!

815
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,040
Shut up!

816
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,600
Please shut up!

817
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,720
I mean, shut up!

818
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,720
One thing I'm good at...

819
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,760
is fixing things.

820
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,720
Dumb chickens.

821
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,840
Let me see now.

822
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,080
Ain't nothing the matter
with this car here.

823
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,560
Buddy, ain't you got
any sense at all?

824
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,080
You just let
your car run out of gas.

825
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,440
I swear, these motherfucking
hippies from New York.

826
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,480
There's a gas station
a couple of miles back.

827
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,960
I'm going this way.

828
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,680
You ought to stop for gas
once in a while, you stupid...

829
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,120
Gotta keep your engine fed.
Wise up, buddy.

830
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,960
Well, how do you like that?

831
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,240
New York hippies
come down here...

832
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,800
and they think they can...
I never, honest and true.

833
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,720
You think a thing
like that happens...

834
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,520
Son of a bitch.

835
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,040
You're so clever.

836
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,800
So clever.

837
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,440
Big mechanical genius.

838
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,520
Here's a bucket, smart guy.
Good luck.

839
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,840
Hey, this is for shit!

840
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,760
You made a big bourgeois deal
out of everything...

841
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,840
and ruined it completely.

842
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,760
I was gonna bug out and be free
from all this bullshit...

843
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,800
and roam around
and dig everything...

844
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,040
and really have a good time.

845
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,080
Your naivete is astounding.

846
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,360
You'd be completely lost
without me, Fritz...

847
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,600
and you know it.

848
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,680
You're a motherfucking bitch.

849
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,000
I see the hard facts of life.

850
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,880
I am realistic,
something you're incapable of.

851
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,640
You'd be better off with
one of those stupid morons...

852
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,520
like Charlene, who you could
sleep with and throw away.

853
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,920
You can't cope
with a mature woman.

854
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,320
You haven't the faintest idea
how lucky you are...

855
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,720
that an intelligent woman...

856
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,320
loves you and wants to
give you something of value...

857
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,400
something that will inflame
your creative potential!

858
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,800
Now, get going and hurry up!

859
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,600
We'll see who gets lost
without whom.

860
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,440
Fritz the Cat

861
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,160
Fritz the Cat

862
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,440
Fritz the Cat

863
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,120
I'm the envy of
each and every guy in town

864
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,600
She looks so sharp,
and the girl does, too

865
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,640
And everybody knows
what I'm gonna do

866
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,440
Gonna take a ride on my bike

867
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,160
Gonna take it
and drive all night

868
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,440
Tell my Chevy to take a hike

869
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,360
Take another ride on my bike

870
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,640
Blue, I'm crazy about you.

871
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,240
Penniless. A regular bum.

872
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,840
A hobo with no money
and no place to go.

873
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,560
Hey, you old scroungy
old alley cat.

874
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,000
Get out of them garbage cans.

875
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,040
You talking to me, Jack?

876
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
What the hell
you doing there, anyway?

877
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,640
Man, here we are on the brink
of the apocalypse...

878
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,520
the eve of destruction,
so to speak...

879
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,440
and I can't think
of anything to do.

880
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,120
Offhand, son,
I'd say you have got a problem.

881
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,320
But at least you're honest.

882
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,840
The revolution
can use a man like you.

883
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,080
Hop on.

884
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,880
-Hello there.
-Hi.

885
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,200
-How are you?
-High.

886
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,040
I'll introduce you to the guys
at the cell meeting.

887
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,720
Blue!
Glad you could make it, man.

888
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,360
Howdy, John. I brought along
an old buddy of mine.

889
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,920
He's a bright lad
but bored with life.

890
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,520
Fritz...

891
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,160
this here is John...

892
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,520
former biker
and small-time hood...

893
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,280
turned fighter for the cause.

894
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,440
That cat was a beautiful head.

895
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,200
Glad to meet you, man.

896
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,680
Another castout
for the bourgeois view.

897
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,560
From the mold
of bankrupt sedentary.

898
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,600
What's the state of
his political consciousness?

899
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,840
Practically nil, I'm afraid.

900
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,720
Our shipment came in today.

901
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,160
Thirty-two survivors.

902
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,520
Go around.

903
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,760
Hey, chief.

904
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,520
Getting ready for a little
action planned for tonight.

905
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,640
We're gonna paralyze
the whole fucking city.

906
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,560
It's going to be great, man.

907
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,800
The shit is really
gonna come down tonight.

908
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,920
We've got everything we need...

909
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,560
for three synchronized
sabotage actions.

910
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,080
The city will be ours.

911
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,840
The machinery
of the establishment...

912
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,360
will be in ruins by morning.

913
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,120
The government will fall
without firing one goddamn shot.

914
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,680
The new mayor will resign...

915
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,840
and we'll move in
and set up a tribunal.

916
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,760
It's curtains.

917
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,600
Blue, honey,
talk to me a minute.

918
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,680
Don't bother me.

919
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,040
I want to talk to you, honey.
Let's go.

920
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,320
Leave me the hell alone.

921
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,200
We'll go and get some chinks.
I'm so hungry.

922
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,240
I ain't hungry.

923
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,440
Don't turn off on me.
Besides...

924
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,440
I don't need that garbage.

925
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,440
Every time you're with
your friends you don't pay...

926
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,160
You son of a bitch!
That hurt me, god damn it!

927
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,880
What do you think I am,
a boxing ball?

928
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,640
A punching bag!

929
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Hit her! Hit her!

930
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,160
You know what you guys are?

931
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,080
You're a bunch of closet fags.

932
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,040
Shut up!

933
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,880
And when I leave this place...

934
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,760
you'll get together
and screw one another.

935
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,920
That's nice.
That is nice.

936
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,760
See, she loves it.

937
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,920
I love it, too.

938
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,280
We've got a lot
of lousy time to kill.

939
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,360
I think I'm gonna ride
that goddamn horse.

940
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,040
Then go on, have a go.
You'll love it.

941
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,280
Let me ride
that goddamn horse.

942
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,600
Get on with it.

943
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,520
You know what you are?

944
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,480
You're a bunch
of fucking Nazi fags!

945
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,640
Guys, that's uncool.
Don't do that.

946
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,680
Listen, you son of a bitch.
You lousy...

947
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,920
Cut it out.
You're hurting her!

948
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,320
You maniacs!
What are you doing to her?

949
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,160
Go ahead and hit me!

950
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:07,200
My God, my God!
I can't take it anymore!

951
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,160
This isn't working out, Blue.
Our relationship stinks.

952
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,240
Come on, Harriet.
Let's go inside. lt's cold.

953
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,240
I have to go to bed by day.

954
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,160
Come on inside, baby.
You'll get hurt out here.

955
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,600
Listen, I tried
to stop them, but l...

956
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,480
Come on, Fritz!

957
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,120
Wait a minute, huh?

958
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,080
John says
this night will mean...

959
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,320
a great leap forward
for America's social evolution.

960
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,520
I dig it.

961
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,320
We're gonna blow up
the power plant.

962
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,560
This will keep you warm.
I gotta go.

963
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,080
Hey, baby.

964
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,320
We all had a good time
and got our rocks off.

965
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,960
Now we must devote ourselves
to the great task before us.

966
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,040
What'd you have
to hit her so hard for?

967
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,320
She loved it.

968
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,520
Me and you have been assigned
to blow up the power plant.

969
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,000
That's all I care about.
The revolution.

970
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,920
You're full of shit!
All you care about...

971
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,560
is a reason to hurt,
to destroy, to blow up.

972
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,600
You don't know what
a real revolution is.

973
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,240
None of you sons of bitches do.

974
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,800
Harriet, well, she's good.

975
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,840
She's real. She loves.

976
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,400
She loves.

977
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,400
And when you get
right down to it...

978
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,000
that's where it's really at.

979
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,880
The love you give is equal
to the love you get.

980
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,440
Well, fuck it.
I ain't doing it.

981
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,360
So long, Fritz.

982
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,280
I ain't planting this bomb
for you schmucks.

983
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,440
Far out.

984
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,840
And though after my skin worms
destroy this body...

985
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,200
yet in my flesh
shall I see God...

986
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,480
whom I shall see
for myself.

987
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,200
You gotta
let us see our Fritz!

988
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,760
Where is he?
What have you done with him?

989
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,520
You can't go in there.

990
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,200
I'm sorry, girls.
He's under house arrest.

991
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,480
Let us see him ! Please!

992
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,600
-No one gets in.
-He's hurt.

993
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,760
Lord Jesus...

994
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,440
and shalt believe
in thine heart...

995
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,080
that God hath raised Him
from the dead.

996
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,960
I reckon he needed her.

997
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,640
He must be through.
Finished.

998
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,680
For with the heart...

999
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,080
man believeth
unto righteousness...

1000
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,320
and with the mouth...

1001
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,320
confession
is made unto salvation.

1002
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,880
He that covereth his sins
shall not prosper...

1003
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,760
but whoso confesseth
and forsaketh them...

1004
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,480
shall have mercy.

1005
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,120
Fritz, we're so sorry, baby.

1006
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,800
He's trying to say something.

1007
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,480
I've been up and down...

1008
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,640
the four corners...

1009
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,120
of this big old world.

1010
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,760
I've...seen it all...

1011
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,160
and I've done it all.

1012
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,800
I've fought many a good man...

1013
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,720
and I've laid many a good woman.

1014
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,560
And...

1015
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,760
if there's one thing
I've learned...

1016
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,720
it's...it's...

1017
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,280
you get over here...

1018
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,360
and you get
down there like that...

1019
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,000
Poor cat.

1020
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,440
He was a...

1021
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,760
he was a tough kid
at that, wasn't he?

1022
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,960
Down the lane

1023
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,720
They're strolling

1024
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,400
Two by two

1025
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,800
Holding hands

1026
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:32,480
They smile like we used to do

1027
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:39,760
Here with their one and only

1028
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,840
I'd forgotten I was lonely

1029
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,320
Oh, how I wish

1030
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,560
That here were there with you

1031
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,320
All the days of sadness

1032
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:04,000
They seem so needless now

1033
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,560
Yes, it's taken me

1034
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,360
This long, long time

1035
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,840
To see

1036
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,920
It's clear

1037
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,160
And my dreams

1038
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:20,840
Keep drifting back to me

1039
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,240
And our strolls

1040
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,960
Beneath these same stars above

1041
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:36,200
And when the leaves

1042
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,760
Are falling

1043
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,800
My heart will be recalling

1044
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,480
You're the only girl

1045
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,360
I ever really loved

1046
01:14:53,160 --> 01:15:11,400
THAT's ALL FOLK's...
