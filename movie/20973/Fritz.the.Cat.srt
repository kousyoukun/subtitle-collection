1
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,292
嘿,是的。1960年代?
Hey, yeah. The 1960's?

2
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,583
快乐时光，沉重时光。
Happy times, heavy times.

3
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,500
-好吧，那你女儿就归你了，对吧?
- All right, so you get your daughter, right?

4
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:35,833
你女儿，她可能是天主教徒。
Your daughter, she might be Catholic.

5
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,542
她可能是犹太人。她可能是任何东西。
She might be Jewish. She might be anything.

6
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:43,375
所以你把她带进所谓的资产阶级美国式家庭，你知道吗?
So you bring her up in what they call the bourgeois, American-type-society family, you know?

7
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,042
你把他们养大，让他们在结婚前不乱搞。
You bring them up so they don't screw until they get married.

8
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,833
你礼拜天带他们去教堂。
You take them to church on Sunday.

9
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,667
那你就尽你所能地教他们。
Then you teach them all you can.

10
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:57,167
你以为你可以教他们如何养家糊口，你应该怎么打扮，怎么做，然后他们送他们去上大学。
What you think you can teach 'em about how to bring up a family, how you should look and act, then they send 'em to college.

11
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,333
你尽了最大努力。
You bust your hump.

12
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,625
没有政府补贴。
No government subsidy.

13
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,083
没人支付。
Nobody's paying nothing.

14
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,625
你要么存钱，要么借钱。
You save your money, or you borrow the money.

15
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,958
你加班。你送她去上大学。
You work overtime. You send her to college.

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,917
你想让她接受教育。
You want her to get an education.

17
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:13,667
第一个复活节她回家度假，她说，“嘿，爸爸，我和一个男人住在一起。”
The first Easter she comes home on a vacation, she says, "Hey, Dad, I'm living with some guy."

18
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:14,833
“你和一个男人住在一起?”
"You're living with some guy?

19
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,625
什么叫你和别人住在一起?”
What do you mean you're living with some guy?"

20
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:19,000
"这就是现在的情况，自由恋爱"
"Well, this is the thing now, free love."

21
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:20,792
-我们正在远离，我们正在远离最初的点。
- We're getting away from, we're getting away from the original point.

22
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,625
我们想知道的是，这些混蛋为什么要暴动?
What we're trying to find is, why are these bastards rioting?

23
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,458
因为他们做毒品。
Because they did dope.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,958
听着，你走错方向了。
Listen, you're going in the wrong direction.

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,792
那又怎样?
What of it?

26
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,667
事情是这样的，我要送你去学校。
What happens is, look, I'm sending you to school.

27
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,250
我拼了命送你去上大学，对吧?
I'm breaking my ass and I'm sendin' you to college, right?

28
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:35,250
我希望你能学到一些东西。
I expect you're going to learn something.

29
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,458
不做清洁工?
Not to be a janitor?

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,167
学点东西证明我对你的投资是正确的。
Learn something to justify my investment in you.

31
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:45,500
但有些人喜欢他们的孩子成为领袖，成为煽动者。
But some of these people revel in the fact that their kids are leaders, are rabble-rousers.

32
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,083
这个混蛋刚刚挑起了一场骚乱。
This son of a bitch just started a riot.

33
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,042
哦，乔，太多了。
Oh, Joe, too much.

34
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:53,667
这些孩子认为他们是第一代在结婚前搞过的人。
These kids think they're the first generation that ever screwed before they got married.

35
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,625
我们都是，但一直只有一个女孩。
We all did, but we always had one girl.

36
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,208
她上了你干掉的那个女孩。
She screwed that girl you took out.

37
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:05,750
这些孩子最好不要结婚，因为如果他们结婚了，他们就没有勇气坚持下去。
It's better off these kids don't get married because, if they get married, they haven't got the guts to stick with it.

But, by so doing, you, too, will be saved.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,250
-我很想，但我能做什么?
- Well, I, I'd like to, but what can I do?

133
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,208
-可爱的眼睛。
- Lovely set of eyes there.

134
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,250
啊，小甜心，你有颗金子般的心。
Ah, little sweet one, with your heart of gold.

135
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:10,250
我知道有个地方可以让我们独处，让我们的灵魂在神圣的真理中相遇。-天啊，你真漂亮。
I know of a place where we can be alone to join our souls in sacred truth. - Gee, you're good lookin'.

136
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,500
-嗨。——嘿!
- Hey. - Hey!

137
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,375
我想参与这件事。
I want to be in on this thing.

138
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,000
-那我的灵魂呢，你个骗子?
- Yeah, what about my soul, you fink?

139
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,000
四个人在床上，我还没试过。
- Four in bed, that's a kink I haven't tried yet.

140
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,417
——什么?——嗯?
- What? - Huh?

141
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:26,667
是的，一起，我们都将学习生命力量的真正存在本质。
Yes, together, we shall all learn of the real existential essence of the life force.

142
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,208
年,“存在”。我曾经听到过这个词。
- Yeas, "existential." I heard that word once.

143
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,208
-什么意思?
- What's it mean?

144
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,833
-意思是"酷，装备"傻瓜,你知道吗?
- It means, like, "Cool, gear". You know, stupid?

145
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,708
-你真是个天才，弗里茨。
- You are a true genius, Fritz.

146
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:53,500
-狂野，这太狂野了。-亲爱的，我也可以去
- Wild, this is wild. - Oh, honey, I could go, too.

147
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,458
——哦,我的天!-我知道。
- Oh, my! - I know that.

148
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:16,167
我知道你知道。你以为我是怎么知道的?
I know you know. How do you think I knew?

149
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,500
-我去拿。该死的!
- I'll get it. God damn it!

150
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,583
-怎么了，伙计?
- What's happening, man?

151
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,708
-嘿，Fritz猫成为年度种马了。
- Hey, Fritz the Cat has become the stud of the year.

152
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,375
我们现在在这里开会，所以我不知道。
We're having a session here now, so I don't know.

153
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,625
——嗯。喂，有人用那个房间吗?
- Hm. Say, anybody using that room?

154
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,667
-那是约翰，我是说，如果你真的喝醉了，伙计。
- That's the john, I mean, if you're really strung out, man.

155
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,625
-我们要了!我们将它!
- We'll take it! We'll take it!

156
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,417
这样,小组。来吧，快点。
This way, group. Come along, now, step lively.

157
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,333
小心你的步骤。
Watch your step.

158
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,458
那是个女孩，咚咚咚咚。
That's a girl, rub-a-dub-a-dub.

159
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,500
一个全新的体验世界在等着我们，亲爱的。
Okay, a new world of experience awaits us, my loves.

160
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:59,000
这个浴缸现在变成了一个真理和爱的太空舱。
This bathtub is now transformed into a space capsule of truth and love.

161
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,250
——哇!这是疯狂的!——是的,是的!
- Wow! This is wild! - Yes, yes!

162
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,292
只有在这样赤裸裸的亲密中，我们才能互相了解。
Only in naked closeness like this, can we all know each other.

163
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,125
——是的!没错!
- Yes! Right!

164
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,625
很好，温斯顿，亲爱的!真正的“裸亲密。”
Very good, Winston, darling! "Naked closeness," true.

165
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:10,500
你是一个有洞察力的女孩。
You are a perceptive girl.

166
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,458
亲密，我们都必须非常亲密。
Closeness, we must all get very close.

167
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,667
事实上，越接近越好。
As close as possible, as a matter of fact.

168
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,625
——是的!——是的。
- Yeah! - Yes.

169
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,708
这是正确的。-太…-让我们靠紧点
That's right. - It's so- - Let's all get close together.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,292
天啊，亲密和满足我们隐藏的欲望通过这些我们可以得到真相。
Ooh, boy, closeness and fulfillment of our hidden desires through which we reach the truth.

171
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,958
实践是很重要的。你不这么认为吗，温斯顿?
Fulfillment is important. Don't you think so, Winston?

172
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,583
哦,是的。
Ooh, yes.

173
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,417
非常重要的。-是的。
Very important. - Yeah.

174
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,208
哦,哇!是的，我想现在我知道真相了。
Oh, wow! Yeah, now I'm getting to the truth, I think, yes.

175
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,292
——哦,是的!——嗯。
- Oh, yes! - Hmm.

176
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,333
现在一切都清楚了。
It's all very clear now.

177
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:44,583
好的,温斯顿。真相来了。
OK, Winston. Here come the truth.

178
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,500
你懂的。
You got the word.

179
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,583
哦,Fritzy。-你有这么一个存在的小身体。
Oh, Fritzy. - You got such an existential little body.

180
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,958
呀,哇!
Jeez, wow!

181
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,667
——哦,狗屎!也许我们该走了?
- Oh, shit! Maybe we better go, huh?

182
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,958
-不不不!一点也不!
- No, no, no! Not at all!

183
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,917
不，我，看这里。你到这里来。
No, I, look here. You get down over here.

184
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,458
你向下，对，像这样向下。
And you down, that's right, down like that.

185
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,292
——我的胳膊!——这是正确的。
- My arm! - That's right.

186
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,792
-就在下面。看脚。
- Right under here. Watch the foot.

187
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,542
不，对，没错。就在这里。
No, right, that's right. Right under here.

188
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,250
好的,准备好了,每个人吗?我们开始吧。
Okay, ready, everyone? Here we go.

189
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,750
-嘿，嘿，嘿，拉尔夫。
- Hey, hey, hey Ralph.

190
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:28,708
我想这就是我们得到报告的地方楼上的孩子们在做这些事，抽烟什么的，我想。
This is, I think this is the place we got the report on where there's these kids upstairs doing this shit and smoking and everything, I think.

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,875
-告诉我该怎么做我以前从没进去过。
- Tell me what to do. I never went in before.

192
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,083
告诉我该怎么做。
Tell me what to do.

193
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,500
-是的，因为你是新手，而这是你的第一次。
- Well, yeah, because you're a rookie and this is your first beat.

194
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,917
你跟着我就行了。你看，我们走上台阶。
You just follow me. You see, we walk up the steps.

195
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,458
我们不制造噪音。比如，我们不制造任何噪音。
We make no noise. Like, we don't make any noise.

196
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,375
你慢慢地跟着我。你明白我的意思吗?
And you follow me slowly. You got that?

197
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,167
是的，就像迪克·特蕾西一样。
I do, just like Dick Tracy.

198
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,917
-不，就像《特里和海盗》。
- No, it's like "Terry and the Pirates".

199
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,250
迪克·特蕾西的旧帽子。现在，我们进去吧。
Dick Tracy's old hat. Now, let's go inside.

200
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,625
——等待。我能搜查那些女孩吗?
- Wait. Could I get to search the girls?

201
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,333
-是的。我已经做得够多了。
- Yeah. I've done enough of that.

202
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,250
我们开始吧。看着我，因为我是天生的行动派。
Here we go. And watch me, 'cause I'm a natural in action.

203
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:02,000
上了台阶。
Up the steps.

204
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:10,792
嘿,男人。
- Hey, man.

205
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,625
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell's going on in here?

206
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,125
-看在上帝的份上，你想要什么?
- For Christ's sake, what do you want?

207
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,625
-看在上帝的份上，弗里茨在搞他自己的小狂欢。
- For Christ's sake, Fritz is having his own private little orgy.

208
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:22,792
行动结束后,男人。
Move over, man.

209
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,750
-你能出去吗?我们在寻找真相!
- Will you get out of here? We're seeking after the truth!

210
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,708
-这是我的浴缸，伙计。
- It's my bathtub, man.

211
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,125
别理那个弗里茨。
Don't pay attention to that Fritz.

212
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,292
他有耶稣情结。
He got a Jesus complex.

213
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,292
-我就知道!
- Oh, I know it!

214
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,000
-尽情享受吧，可爱的小鸟。
- Have some joy puff, sweet little bird.

215
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,917
-你好，纽约。
- Hello, hello, New York.

216
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,083
听说你在这里开大麻聚会。
Heard you're having a hash session here.

217
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,792
-哇，就在这里!
- Wow, this is where it's at!

218
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,083
-好吧，来吧。
- Right, yeah, man, come join us.

219
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,625
有很多好东西，伙计。
Good stuff and lots of it, man.

220
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,125
只要关上门，我们就谦虚。
Only close the door, we're modest.

221
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,125
-哈，哈，哈，这家伙真逗。
- Har har har, the guy's a riot.

222
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,042
-哦,上帝!上帝,我有!
- Oh, God! God, I'm there!

223
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,000
我就在这里!-你真的在那儿?
I'm there! - You're really there?

224
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:22,542
它是如何?-这是，哦，这是-怎么样?
How is it? - It's, oh, it's- - How is it?

225
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,250
——这是有趣的。我已经不在那里了。
- That's funny. I'm not there anymore.

226
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,000
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

227
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,208
-我是个作家。我们来谈谈吧。
- I'm a writer. Let's talk about it.

228
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,250
-以前和食蚁兽做过吗?
- Ever made it with an aardvark before?

229
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,125
这是个难得的机会，你知道吗?我们很少。
It's a rare opportunity, you know? We're scarce.

230
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,167
真的吗?
Really?

231
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,625
-我不知道我是不是在那里。你怎么知道?
- I can't tell if I'm there or not. How do you tell?

232
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,792
-你会知道的
- Oh, you'll know when you are.

233
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,250
——哦,球。它对我不起作用。
- Oh, balls. It doesn't work for me.

234
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,167
我抽大麻是个失败的人。
I'm a failure as a pot smoker.

235
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,083
-别难过。总有一天你会成功的，真的。
- Don't be sad. Someday you'll make it, really.

236
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,625
嘘。我想我们到了。
Shh. I think we're here.

237
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,750
-你听到什么了吗，拉尔夫?
- Do you hear anything, Ralph?

238
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:37,375
-听起来像是一群堕落的人。
- It sounds like a bunch of degenerates in there.

239
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,833
-嘘，嘘，听着，拉尔夫。现在,倾听。
- Shh, shh, now, listen, Ralph. Now, listen.

240
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,667
你的声音更低沉，看到了吗?
You got the deeper voice, you see?

241
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,750
我要你大声喊"快他妈开门"
And I want you to yell, "Open the fucking door."

242
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,083
现在，说"操"这个词
Now, say the word "Fucking"

243
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,792
因为那让你听起来很强硬。
because that makes you sound tough.

244
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,792
我说三，你就喊"打开…"
When I say three, you yell, "Open..."

245
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,208
-我甚至会即兴表演!我要即兴演出!
- I'm even gonna ad-lib! I'm gonna ad-lib!

246
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,917
-不要即兴表演，拉尔夫。没有即兴表演。
- No ad-libbing, Ralph. No ad-libbing.

247
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,875
-我就叫他们变态吧让我称他们为变态者。
- Let me call them preverts. Let me call them preverts.

248
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:58,708
-什么是prevert?
- What's a prevert?

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,875
-堕落者是堕落者。你不知道吗?
- A prevert is a degenerate. Didn't you know that?

250
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,208
-变态就是堕落?
- A prevert's a degenerate?

251
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,042
-你就没有教养吗?
- Didn't you have no bringing up?

252
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,167
-我参加了成人礼。
- I got bar-mitzvahed.

253
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,625
-你不该笑的，拉尔夫!
- You ain't supposed to laugh, Ralph!

254
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,167
这是一份严肃的工作，而且我们还能得到报酬。
This is a serious job and we're getting paid for it.

255
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,208
别他妈废话了。我们走吧!
Cut the fucking shit out. Let's go!

256
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:23,125
——好的。把门打开!
- All right. Open up in there!

257
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,000
这是法律，嬉皮士混蛋!——好!
It's the law, hippie bastards! - Good job!

258

317
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,625
-天啊，我他妈的是个逃犯。

00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,583
-嘿，听着，我能听到他们。

322
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,833
听起来不像英语。

323
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,333
他们是波多黎各人吗?

324
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,083
-拉尔夫，你在考验我的耐心。
- Ralph, you're trying my patience, Ralph.

325
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,958
-你走那条红毯我走这条红毯
- You go down that aisle, I'll go down this aisle.

拉尔夫，请安静。这是我的人。
And Ralph, please be quiet. It's my people.

328

332
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,708

本叔叔，你好吗?我在抓罪犯。
Uncle Ben, how are you? I'm catching a criminal.

338
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,208
对不起，拉布，是你。你找到他了吗?
Excuse me, Rabb, it's you. Did you find him?

339
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:19,333
不，他在那边，但是

344
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,833
你救了我的命!

345
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,042
我们中断以色列-阿拉伯战争是为了这个特别声明。
We interrupt the Israeli-Arab war for this special announcement.

346

-在该死的条子出现之前，我一直很开心。
- I had a great thing going till the frigging fuzz showed up.

359
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,333
我真希望那个瘦女人没把淋浴也打开。
I wish that skinny broad didn't turn on the shower, too.

360
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,375

I think I'm getting a cold. Hello, men.

361
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,792
大家都在忙着准备考试什么的吗?
Everybody all busy studying for their goddamn exams and all?

362
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,417
巴斯，你跟那个小妞怎么样了?
Hey, Buzz, how'd it go with that Dee-Dee chick, huh?

363
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,875
她身材不错，是吧?你得承认。
She's got some bod, huh? You have to admit.

364
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,667
夏琳也不赖，对吧?
Oh, Charlene isn't bad, either, though, right?

365
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:01,333
像,哇!海恩斯!
Like, wow! Hines!

366
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,208
你这头猪，老伙计猪!
You swine, old buddy pig!

367
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,333
你跟在阿尔维娜后面，今晚会很爽吧?
You groove behind Alvina, get some kicks tonight, huh?

368
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:15,917
混蛋，你还以为考试就是存在，宇宙生命力之类的一切。
Bastards, you'd think the goddamn exams was the be-all and end-all of existence, cosmic life force or something.

369
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,833
你会以为他们是该死的逃犯。
You'd think they were the frigging fugitives.

370
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,583
连跟男人说几句好话都不行。
Can't even get in a few decent words to a guy.

371
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:27,583
混蛋!真烦人，他们就坐在那儿拿钱。
Bastards! What a bore, they just sit there and take bennies.

372
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:32,375
然后整晚都把脸埋在一堆书里翘着大拇指。
And stay up all night with their face stuck in a bunch of books and their thumb up their ass.

373
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:40,917
是的，是的，我记得那段时间，所有这些历史，文学和社会学的东西，都很鼓舞人心，很有启发性。
Oh, yes, yes, I remember the time when it was all very inspiring and enlightening, all this history and literature and sociology shit.

374
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:50,167
你认为学习是一件很重要的事情，然后你变成了一个大知识分子，坐在那里试图在智力上超过其他所有的大知识分子。
You think learning is a really big thing and you become this big fucking intellectual and sit around trying to out-intellectual all the other big fucking intellectuals.

375
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:57,417
你年复一年地埋头于这些该死的大部头而世界却与你擦肩而过。
You spend years and years with your nose buried in these goddamn tomes while the world is passing you by.

376
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:05,000
所有的东西，所有的踢，所有的女孩都在那里。
All the stuff to see and all the kicks and all the girls are out there.

377
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,542
而我，一个作家!
And me, a writer!

378
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:16,875
一个诗人应该经历人生的种种变化、矛盾和讽刺，走过世界上所有的道路!
And a poet who should be having adventures and experiencing all the diversities and paradoxes and ironies of life and passing over all the roads of the world!

379
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:27,292
挖遍所有的城市，城镇，河流和海洋，把它们都变成小鸡。
And digging all the cities and towns and rivers and the oceans and making all of them chicks.

380
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:31,583
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

381
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:39,333
作为一个作家和诗人，我有责任走出去，挖掘这个世界，趁着还有时间，在这该死的世界里畅游，伙计。
As a writer and a poet, it is my duty to get out there and dig the world, to swim in the whole frigging scene while there is still time, man.

382
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,500
我放屁的日子结束了，宝贝。
My farting around days are over, baby.

383
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:46,542
从今天起，我要把每一天都当作生命中的最后一天来过。
From this day on, I shall live every day as if it was my last.

384
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,125
是的,是的!我必须这么做!
Yeah, yeah! I must do it!

385
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:56,708
不再有沉闷无聊的课程，不再有沉闷的讲座，不再和自命清高的胖嬉皮士坐在一起扯淡。
No more of the dreary, boring classes, the dismal lectures, the sitting around bullshitting with pretentious fat-ass hippies.

386
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,583
不再有书，不再有一群自以为知道全部内幕的老混蛋的胡言乱语。
No more of the books, the spoutings of a bunch of old farts who think they know the whole goddamn score.

387
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,292
天啊，我做了什么?
Oh, my God, what have I done?

388

我把我所有的笔记、书和其他东西都烧了，现在我不能准备考试了。
I set all my notes and books and stuff on fire and now I can't study for my exams.

389
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:25,000

I'll flunk out and my folks will be pissed off as hell.

390
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,375
我去拿条毯子。

毯子着火了。

418
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:34,042
我买了两罐苹果黄油，现在我不吃了，因为怀蒂在吃火腿三明治，而我在吃花生酱三明治。
With apple butter, I got two cans of it now that I don't eat because Whitey was eating ham sandwiches and I was eating peanut butter sandwiches.

-我现在要热了。

432
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:37,667
事实上，在南方坐公共汽车连个地方都去不了。
As a matter of fact, you couldn't even go no place down South riding a bus.

433
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,333
连杯汽水都拿不到，走进去给你买个三明治。
Couldn't even get a soda, walk in there and get you a sandwich.

那是另一回事。
Well, that's a different thing.

437

我是一个有工作的人，我在纳税。
I'm a working man and I'm paying my taxes.

438
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,708
钱就是一切，明白我的意思吗?
The money is what's happening. See what I mean?

439
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,792
-不，我说的是…-当一切都重要的时候
- No, I'm talkin' about- - When it all counts, that is what's happening.

440
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:14,292
我说的是，如果你想要革新，你可以先吃点面包，然后再说废话。
I'm talking about about as far as, if you want to be revolutionary, you get some bread first, and then you can talk trash.

441
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,000
-白人用宗教来蒙蔽我们。

因为在这次骚乱之前，你们没有儿童学前教育计划。
Because before this rioting and shit, you didn't have no Head Start programs for kids.

445
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,625
你什么都没有!
You didn't have shit!

446
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,125
真的，你什么都没有。

让你在哈莱姆区卖马肉。
Got you down in Harlem selling horse meat.

-伙计，你在袋子里吗?

454
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,500
-别失去你的冷静，猫。
- Well, just don't lose your coolness, cat.

455
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,708
我是说，不要失去你的冷静。

-你说话倒轻松。你是一只乌鸦。
- Easy for you to talk. You're a crow.

457

我希望我是一只乌鸦。
I wish I was a crow.

458

如果我是乌鸦，我会飞走的。
If I was a crow, I'd fly away, man.

459
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,958
我会永远离开这个悲惨的小镇。
I'd fly away from this miserable town for good.

460
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:37,458
-你以为当乌鸦就是个大蛋蛋吗?
- You think being a crow is a big motherfucking ball?

461
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,667
你们这些猫都一样，伙计。
All you cats the same, man.

462

As a cat, I have a considerable guilt complex because my kind have always brought suffering on your kind.

473
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,000

有时候我真的很担心。
Sometimes I really get hung up about it.

479

- It's a bug out to him. - It's some kind of dance.

495
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,208
嘿,听着,男人。

嘿，我的照片上电视了吗?
Hey, has my picture appeared on TV yet?

642
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,000
他们发出警报了吗?
Have they broadcast an alarm?

643
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:44,125
他们有没有悬赏缉拿我的线索?
Have they offered a reward for any information leading to my arrest?

644
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:46,375
-别这么夸张
- Oh, don't be so melodramatic.

645
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,875
你和你的宏伟幻想。
You and your illusions of grandeur.

646
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,833
我才不要和你一起进那个肮脏的垃圾桶。
I'm not getting in that filthy, grimy garbage can with you.

647
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,250
-好吧，去你妈的
- Okay, go fuck yourself.

648
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:55,625
-你真是个孩子。
- Oh, you're such a child.

649
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:59,292
这样一个以自我为中心，自我中心的孩子。
Such a self-centered, egotistical child.

650
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,708
这太恶心了。
Oh, this is disgusting.

651
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,250
听着，如果你想这么说我的垃圾桶，你还是滚吧。
Look, if you're gonna talk about my garbage can that way, you can just get the hell out.

652
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:09,292
听着，弗里茨，你还打算逃跑吗?
Listen, Fritz, are you still going to bug out or not?

653
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,750
你在开玩笑吗，宝贝?
Are you kidding, toots?

654
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,750
我现在别无选择。
I got no choice at this point.

655
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,250
听我说，好吗?
Listen to me, will you?

656
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,958
我有一辆车和一些钱。
I've got a car and some money.

657
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,542
我能买到我们需要的所有东西，我们可以马上离开。
I can get all the things we need and we can leave right away.

658
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,708
我们可以去海边。
We can go out to the coast.

659
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,458
我会找个私人秘书的好工作你可以写诗什么的。
I'll get a good job as a private secretary and you can work on your poetry and all.

660
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:31,292
-哦,好的。-然后，我们可以结婚，在弗里斯科租一个漂亮的小公寓，在那里欣赏风景。
- Oh, okay. - Then, we can get married and rent a nice little pad in Frisco and dig the scene out there.

661
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,167
那应该是个很棒的城市。
It's supposed to be a great town.

662
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,917
弗里斯科,是的。嘿,好吧。

683
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,333
我们终于在那条古老而寂寞的公路上飞驰。
At last we're zooming down that old lonesome highway.

684
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,583
哦,它是野生的!
Oh, it's wild!

685
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:28,958
——是的,太不可思议了。
- Yeah, marvelous.

686
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,625
-太棒了!这是令人激动的,得意的。
- Marvelous, my ass! It's exalting, elating.

687
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:35,333
凉爽的夜风从窗前吹过。哦,男人!
The cool night wind blowing past the window. Oh, man!

688
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,667
——我饿了。我们找个地方停一下吧。
- I'm hungry. Let's stop some place.

689
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:39,708
-见鬼去吧。
- The hell with stopping.

690
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,667
我只想感受时光飞逝。
I just want to feel those miles flying by.

691
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:44,583
我饿了!
I'm hungry!

692
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:54,083
-嘿，我们去找个油腻腻的小卡车站。
- Hey, let's dig one of those little greasy truck stops.

693
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,792
我想和那些卡车司机谈谈，你知道吗?
I'd like to talk with those truck drivers, you know?

694
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,417
听听他们对旅途生活的看法。
Hear what they got to say about life on the road.

695
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:20,000
是啊，我打赌他们有很多关于公路的疯狂故事。
Yeah, I bet they got wild stories of the road.

696
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:25,083
司机，卡车，劫机者，打架!
You know, drivers, trucks, hijackers, fights!

697
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,792
好，好，开始吧!
Yeah, yeah, let's do it!

698
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:27,958
-这是个好地方。
- Here's a good place.

699
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:36,292
我要一份高级牛排，加沙拉和黑咖啡。
I'll have your deluxe steak with salad and coffee, black.

700
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,292
——好的。先生，您想要点什么?
- All right. What would you like, sir?

701
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:44,500
哦，这牛排真好吃。
- Oh, that was really a fine steak.

702
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:48,083
你总是可以信赖霍华德·约翰逊的。
You can always depend upon Howard Johnson's.

703
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:51,125
我们继续上路吧?
Let's get back on the road, huh?

704
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:03,625
——噢,该死的。弗里茨，弗里茨，快醒醒!
- Oh, goddamn. Fritz, Fritz, wake up!

705
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:04,958
——嗯?什么?
- Huh? What?

706
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:10,542
-弗里茨，车坏了，我拿不到那该死的东西-什么?我们在哪里?
- Fritz, the car is broken down and I can't get the damned thing- - What? Where are we?

707
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:11,625
去你妈的。
Oh, fuck a duck.

708
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:14,417
我们在这该死的沙漠中央。
We're out in the middle of the frigging desert.

709
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,208
耶稣,太好了!
Jesus, it's great!

710
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,417
——没错。你已经睡了两天了。
- Exactly. You've been sound asleep for two days.

711
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:20,417
——什么?
- What?

712
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:21,458
——两天。
- Two days.

713
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,125
你一定是在大吃大喝之后被拖出来的。
You really must've been dragged out after your big binge.

714
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:26,500
——大便。我想是的。
- Shit. I guess I was.

715
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:29,542
喝酒，吸大麻，乱搞，伙计。
All that drinking and blowing pot and screwing, man.

716
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:33,542
伙计，我一想就欲火中烧。像,哇!
Hey, man, I get horny just thinking about it. Like, wow!

717
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:38,000
-开始考虑修车吧，弗里茨，否则我们就永远坐在这里了。
- Start thinking about fixing this car, Fritz or we'll be sitting here forever.

718
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:41,375
好吧,是的。有什么事让你心烦吗，伙计?
Okay, yeah. Look, is something bugging you, pal?

719
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:44,417
是啊，车开不动!
Yeah, the car won't go!

720
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:49,250
-好吧，让我们看看。
- Oh, okay, well, let's have a look.

721
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:53,292
好吧，我一直都知道。
Yeah, okay, I knew that all the time.

722
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,250
引擎不在上面。在后面。
The engine's not up here. It's in the back.

723
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:57,625
让我们去看看。
Let's just check it out.

724
00:59:57,917 --> 00:59:59,750
——怎么了?-让我看看，我就。
- What's wrong? - Let me see, I'll just.

725
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:04,167
如果我移动它，不会。-怎么了，弗里茨?
If I move that, no. - What's wrong, Fritz?

726
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,917
-这很复杂，温斯顿。
- Well, it's all very complicated, Winston.

727
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,208
我不知道该怎么解释。
I couldn't begin to explain it.

728
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,042
我想活塞杆卡在传动轴上了。
I think the piston rod's stuck in the drive shaft.

729
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:13,083
要不然就是化油器生锈了。
Either that or the carburetor is rusted out.

730
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:14,375
-天啊
- Oh, good God.

731
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:19,833
-嘿，来了一辆皮卡。
- Hey, here comes a pickup truck.

732
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,250
也许他会把我们推到下一个加油站。
Maybe he'll give us a push to the next gas station.

733
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,667
-怎么了，伙计?
- What's the trouble, buddy?

734
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,500
我们的车坏了。
- Our car is busted down.

735
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,208
你能帮我们推到下一个加油站吗?
Could you give us a push to the next gas station?

736
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:34,750
-让我看看。
- Well, let me look at it.

737
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:37,708
我擅长的一件事就是修东西。
One thing I'm good at is fixing things.

738
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,792
闭嘴!闭嘴，胆小鬼!
Shut up! You shut up, chickens!

739
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:50,875
闭嘴!我说闭嘴的时候，我是说，闭嘴!
Shut up! When I say shut up, I mean, shut up!

740
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,875
我擅长的一件事就是修东西。
One thing I'm good at is fixing things.

741
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:06,375
愚蠢的鸡。
Dumb chickens.

742
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,917
让我看看。
Let me see now.

743
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:13,167
这车没什么问题。
Ain't nothing the matter with this car here.

744
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,625
嘿，伙计，你难道一点都不懂事吗?
Hey, buddy, ain't you got any sense at all?

745
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:19,000
你会让你的车没油的。
You just gonna let your car run out of gas.

746
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:22,000
我发誓，这些该死的纽约嬉皮士。
I swear, these motherfucking hippies in New York.

747
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,000
几英里外有个加油站。
There's a gas station a couple of miles back.

748
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:27,708
我要走这边。
I'm going this way.

749
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,208
你应该偶尔停下来加油，你这个笨蛋。
You ought to stop for gas once in a while, you stupid.

750
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,750
你得保持动力，放聪明点，伙计。
You gotta keep your engine fed. Wise up, buddy.

751
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:38,250
你觉得怎么样?
Well, how do you like that?

752
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:43,125
纽约嬉皮士来到这里，他们认为他们可以，我从来没有，说实话。
New York hippies come down here and they think they can, I never, honest and true.

753
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:46,833
你以为会发生这种事。
You think a thing like that happens.

754
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,042
狗娘养的
- Son of a bitch.

755
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:54,167
-你太聪明了，太聪明了，机械天才。
- You're so clever, so clever, big mechanical genius.

756
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:58,458
这是桶，聪明的家伙。好运！
Here's a bucket, smart guy. Good luck!

757
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,750
-嘿，这是狗屁!
- Hey, this is for shit!

758
01:02:00,042 --> 01:02:03,250
你把一切都变成了资产阶级的大买卖，把一切都毁了。
You made a big bourgeois deal out of everything and ruined it completely.

759
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:12,167
我要离开这里，远离这些乱七八糟的东西到处闲逛，挖掘一切，享受美好时光。
I was gonna bug out and be free from all this bullshit and roam around and dig everything and really have a good time.

760
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,667
-你的天真真令人吃惊。
- Your naivete is astounding.

761
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:18,125
没有我你会完全迷失的，弗里茨，你知道的。
You'd be completely lost without me, Fritz, and you know it.

762
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:19,500
-你他妈的就是个婊子
- You're a motherfucking bitch.

763
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:21,667
-我看到了生活的残酷事实。
- I see the hard facts of life.

764
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:25,958
我很现实，这是你做不到的。
I am realistic, something you're incapable of.

765
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:31,708
你最好找个夏琳那样的白痴，你可以跟她上床，完事后就把她扔了。
You'd be better off with one of those stupid morons like Charlene, who you could just sleep with and throw away when you're done.

766
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,292
你应付不了一个成熟的女人。
You can't cope with a mature woman.

767
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:44,292
你不知道你有多幸运，一个聪明的女人爱你，想给你一些有价值的东西，一些能激发你创造潜能的东西!
You haven't the faintest idea how lucky you are that an intelligent woman loves you and wants to give you something of value, something that will inflame your creative potential!

768
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:46,458
现在，快走吧!

再说了，我不需要那些垃圾。
Besides- - I don't need that garbage.

826
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:44,417
-每次你和朋友在一起的时候你都不注意，你这个狗娘养的!

伙计们,这是粗野的。
Guys, that's uncool.

843
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,458
不要这样做。
Don't do that.

844
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,042
听着，你个狗娘养的，你个讨厌的
Listen, you son of a bitch, you lousy-

845
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:37,833
-嘿，别闹了!你伤害她!
- Hey, cut it out! You're hurting her!

846
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:41,583
你疯子!你要对她做什么?
You maniacs! What are you doing to her?

Come on, Harriet. Let's go inside, huh?

它是凉的。——哦。

进来吧，宝贝。你在这里会受伤的。
Come on inside, baby. You'll get hurt out here.

约翰说今晚将意味着美国社会进步的一大步。
John says this night will mean a great leap forward for America's social evolution.

是啊，明白了。我们要炸掉发电厂。
Yeah, dig it. We're gonna blow up the power plant.

859
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,000
这可以让你暖和。
This will keep you warm.

860
01:09:49,292 --> 01:09:49,917
我要走了。
I gotta go.

861
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,083
——嘿,宝贝。
- Hey, baby.

862
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,708
我们今天都玩得很开心，很开心。
We all had a good time today and got our rocks off.

863
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,375
现在我们必须献身于摆在我们面前的伟大任务。
Now we must devote ourselves to the great task that lays before us.

864
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:34,667
-你为什么打她那么重?
- What'd you have to hit her so hard for?

865
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:36,042
-她很喜欢。

866
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,333
听着，伙计，我和你的任务是炸掉发电厂。
Listen, man, me and you have been assigned to blow up the power plant.

867
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,417
我只关心革命。
That's all I care about, the revolution.

868
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,125
-你胡说八道!
- You're full of shit!

869
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:48,000
你所关心的只是一个伤害，毁灭，爆炸的理由。
All you care about is a reason to hurt, to destroy, to blow up.

870
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,167
你不知道真正的革命是什么。
You don't know what a real revolution is.

871
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:01,958
你们这些狗娘养的都不知道。
None of you sons of bitches do.

872
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:14,375
哈丽特，她很好，我是说。
Harriet, well, she's good, I mean.

873
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:18,417
她是真实的。她喜欢。
She's real. She loves.

874
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:25,167
她喜欢，当你认真对待的时候，我是说，那才是真正的重点。
She loves and when you get right down to it, I mean, that's where it's really at.

875
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:32,708
是的。你付出的爱等于你得到的爱。
Yeah. The love you give is equal to the love you get.

876
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,625
哦,他妈的。我不干了。
Well, fuck it. I ain't doing it.

877
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:37,833
-再见，弗里茨。
- So long, Fritz.

878
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:41,250
-我不会为你们这些笨蛋埋炸弹的。
- I ain't planting this bomb for you schmucks.

879
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:08,917
远了。
Far out.

880
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,458
维尼博士，维尼博士。
Dr. Pooh, Dr. Pooh.

881
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:36,792
我这皮肉灭绝以后，我必在肉体之外得见神，我要亲自见他。
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself.

882
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,708
-弗里茨·弗里茨!你得让我们见见我们的弗里茨!
- Fritz, Fritz! You gotta let us see our Fritz!

883
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,083
-对不起，姑娘们。-他在哪里?
- I'm sorry, girls. - Where is he?

884
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,917
你对他做了什么?
What have you done with him?

885
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,583
-你不能进去你不能。
- You can't go in there. You just can't.

886
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:45,708
对不起,女孩。他被软禁在家。
I'm sorry, girls. He's under house arrest.

887
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,542
-让我们看看他!拜托!
- Let us see him! Please!

888
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:47,667
-不，不，没人能进去。——好吗?
- No, no, no one gets in. - Please?

889
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:54,333
他的受伤。你应当心里相信神已经叫他从死里复活。
He's hurt. - Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead.

890
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:01,708
我想他一定完蛋了，完蛋了。
- I reckon he must be through, finished.

891
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:14,833
-因为人心里相信，就可以称义;口里承认，就可以得救。
- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.

892
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:23,542
遮掩自己罪过的，必不亨通。承认离弃罪过的，必蒙怜恤。
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them, shall have mercy.

893
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,833
弗里茨，我们很抱歉，宝贝。
Fritz, we're so sorry, baby.

894
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,250
嘘!他想说点什么。
