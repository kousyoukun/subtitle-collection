("Oriental Boy" by Mia Kim)

3
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:28,100
* Oriental boy all alone

4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,067
* Runnin' all the
way to your home

5
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:36,000
* Breathing very hard
like a kung fu dragon

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
* Listen to your
heart as you run

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,133
* Go, go, go, go, go

8
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,567
* Oriental boy

9
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,767
* Watch out, go, go, go

10
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:51,633
* Oriental boy, do you dream

11
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:55,567
* Dream what you can do as a man

12
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:59,400
* Flying far away,
all across the ocean

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,333
* Do what you imagine you can

14
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,433
* Go, go, go, go, go

15
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,600
* Oriental boy,
hang on, go go go

16
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,533
* What if there
are dangerous men

17
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,900
* Oh no

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,700
* Maybe there's
a beautiful jewel

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,933
* Uh huh

20
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,633
* You can go and saver
her and be a hero

21
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:38,633
* Look out Western
world, comin' through

22
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,733
* Go, go, go, go, go

23
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:45,900
* Oriental boy,
look out, go go go

24
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,667
* Oriental boy, you can see

25
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:21,467
* Anywhere you are you know

26
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:25,400
* Sing about the heart
of a kung fu dragon

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,333
* Let the people into your soul

28
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,267
* Go, go, go, go, go

29
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:36,267
* Oriental boy, so so, go go go

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,400
* He's gonna make
it, you know he will

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,133
* He's gonna make it on his own

32
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:57,100
* He's gonna make
it, you know he will

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,033
* He's gonna make it on his own

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,167
- Grandfather, Grandfather.
(breathes heavily)

35
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,267
I couldn't get a doctor.

36
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,767
- Son.

37
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,400
- Grandfather, please don't die.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,900
- I must go a way for a while.

39
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:18,267
- I'll make you proud of me.

40
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:20,733
When I grow up, I'll
make lots of money.

41
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,067
- Let me tell you, Grandson,

42
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,933
money is not the most
important thing in life.

43
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,133
The most important thing is

44
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,367
broads. Broads!

45
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,267
Don't you ever forget it.

46
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,000
- If you die, Grandfather,

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,767
there will be nobody
to take care of me.

48
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,633
- Go America.

49
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:46,700
- America?

50
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,533
- Yes.

51
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:52,567
- Long time ago, when I
was a merchant marine.

52
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,433
In New York, I met the most
beautiful lady in the world.

53
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
I fell in love with her.

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,000
When you find her,

55
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,033
she'll take care of you.

56
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,833
- How can I find her?

57
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:15,700
- Here.

58
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,933
Take this.

59
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,167
It'll help you.

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,233
I don't know if
she's still there.

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,533
If you find her,

62
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,300
tell her

63
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,333
I loved her.

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,100
- Yes, I'll...
(dramatic music)

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Grandfather?

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,967
(dramatic music)

67
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,833
- [Pete] Bruce, I like
some more sauce, huh?

68
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,333
- Boss, why do you
keep calling me Bruce?

69
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,567
I'm Joon.

70
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:16,800
Bruce was the champ.

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,267
- I don't care,
champ or no champ,

72
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,933
I'm callin' you Bruce,
and when I call you Bruce,

73
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,067
you are Bruce, you understand?

74
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,433
Besides, you all
look alike anyway.

75
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,667
(laughter)

76
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,900
- [Man] It's true!

77
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,833
- Can he really do that
karate stuff real good?

78
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:30,767
- Bruce?

79
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,267
Nah, he can't even chop a liver.

80
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:35,500
(laughing)
- Oh, God.

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,833
- Mm, hey Bruce, the
sauce is wonderful.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,433
What's your secret, huh?

83
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,267
- Dog meat.

84
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:44,233
(gagging)

85
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,233
It's a joke.

86
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,833
But seriously, folks,

87
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,800
I make the best
spaghetti in the world,

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
with a special flour
from mainland China.

89
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,200
You see, 5,000 years ago,

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,167
Chinese invented the noodle.

91
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,100
And Marco Polo came to China,

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,767
and took it back to Italy,

93
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,567
and it becomes spaghetti.

94
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,267
(laughing)

95
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,433
And I can even
sing Italian song.

96
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,367
- [Man] Oh yeah?

97
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,933
(speaks in Italian)

98
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,867
(sings in Italian)

99
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:22,167
(tense music)

100
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,333
- Rico, how are you, my friend.

101
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,533
- Bonjourno, Capo,
you're looking well.

102
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,500
- I feel good.

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,400
- Come, join me in this feast.

104
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,867
- No, excuse me.

105
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,867
I promised the wife, Nicola,
dinner at home tonight.

106
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,633
- Rico, you brought
me somethin'?

107
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,400
- You're gonna like this.

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,233
It's pure.

109
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:08,600
(dramatic music)

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,833
(shouting and screams)

111
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:22,100
(punches and kicks thud)
(shouting)

112
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,967
(shouting)

113
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,400
(kick thuds)

114
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,300
(punches and kicks thud)

115
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,400
(glass shatters)

116
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,500
- You have the right
to remain silent.

117
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,800
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

118
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,033
in a court of law.

119
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,400
Uh...

120
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
Dammit, what's the next line?

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
- And the right to seek council.

122
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,833
- Oh yeah, thanks.

123
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,067
You have the right
to an attorney.

124
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:10,233
In the event you
cannot afford one, uh,

125
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,133
I'm available.

126
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,533
(drum beats)

127
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,033
- [Monks] Hare Krishna.

128
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,133
Hare Krishna.

129
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,167
Hare, hare.

130
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:26,967
- Many pardon.

131
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,367
But we are lost.

132
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,433
Where's Disney Land?

133
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,333
- Do we look like Mickey Mouse?

134
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,167
- Ah, so.

135
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,800
Ah, Mickey Mouse.

136
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,367
(cameras click)

137
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,300
- Hey, get out of here.

138
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:46,033
(tense music)

139
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,400
- [Monks] Hare Krishna.

140
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,300
Hare, Hare.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,100
Hare Krishna.

142
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,067
Hare, hare.

143
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,267
Hare Krishna.

144
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,033
Hare Krishna.

145
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,767
- Care for a flower, sir.

146
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,233
- Hey, we carry our own flower.

147
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,900
You just pray for us.

148
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,867
(dramatic music)

149
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:11,267
(punches and kicks thud)

150
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,567
(speaks in foreign language)

151
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,433
- I can't stand this anymore.

152
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:31,400
- I'm taking off this one too.

153
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,233
- Me too!

154
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,867
You're under arrest.

155
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,467
You have the right
to remain silent.

156
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,700
- He's out cold.

157
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,867
You better give
him mouth to mouth

158
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,967
and make this bust legal.

159
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,967
(sniffs)

160
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,967
- Thanks, I needed that.

161
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:03,033
- We're losin' the men to
these federal agent busts.

162
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,400
We need the solutions now.

163
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,033
- We can bribe the FBI.

164
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:10,200
- We'll give them
our brand of cigars.

165
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,633
Dynamite.

166
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:14,667
- Let's infest in bulletproof
Gucci loafers. (giggles)

167
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:17,167
- Hey, I got an original idea.

168
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,933
Let's just make them an
offer that they can't refuse.

169
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,967
(groans)

170
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,400
Offer our mother-in-laws, eh?

171
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,667
- Boss, enough.

172
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,467
What do you mean the boss
to think that this is?

173
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,167
Monkey business?

174
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,500
- Maybe there's a
leak in the system.

175
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,000
You can't trust
anybody, can ya, Pete.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,933
- You the one to
know about the leaks.

177
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,567
You got a big mouth.

178
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,033
And don't forget, Big Al,

179
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,300
I'm the one in power here.

180
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,000
- Maybe that's our problem.

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
- You push too far.

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,833
(speaks in Italian)
(phone rings)

183
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,400
That's a call from New York.

184
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
Hello.

185
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,333
- Ciao, Lil Pete.

186
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,933
- [Pete] Ciao, boss,
it's nice of you to call.

187
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,667
- Do you have your men with ya?

188
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:04,033
- Oh, yes, boss, they're
all here. Everybody's here.

189
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,200
- [Boss] Put me on conference.

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,033
- Si.

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
- You boys have embarrassed me.

192
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,467
Opportunities blown.

193
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,300
It's hard to believe.

194
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,067
You guys being defeated

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,433
by a bunch of kung fu clowns.

196
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:24,433
The next time you're on the job,

197
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,767
you think about your family.

198
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,667
One more mistake,

199
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,700
they'll be widows and orphans.

200
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm going to make
sashimi out of you.

201
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,333
(dramatic music)

202
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,400
(chewing)

203
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,633
(tense music)

204
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:03,467
This

205
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,933
is the last fish

206
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,767
that I'm going to eat.

207
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,433
The next meal

208
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:13,467
will be you.

209
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,533
Kapish?

210
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,167
- Yes, Boss, don't worry.

211
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,067
Grazie, ciao.

212
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,500
- [Boss] Ciao, Lil
Pete. Goodbye, boys.

213
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,867
(overlapping dialogue)

214
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,500
- We gotta do something.

215
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,933
Pretty soon, we're
gonna have the feds

216
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,533
fightin' in our own back yard.

217
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,267
(shouting)

218
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,033
- [Gangster] Oh my
God, it's a raid!

219
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:34,967
- Don't shoot!

220
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,767
Hey, guys, it's me, Freddy!

221
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,900
(shouting)

222
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,133
(shouts)

223
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,167
(shouts)

224
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:44,900
(dramatic music)

225
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,200
- What the hell is he doin'?

226
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,467
- Makin' lunch.

227
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,000
- Hi, boss.

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,067
I'm makin' spaghetti for you.

229
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,367
You know the difference between

230
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,200
Italian food and Chinese food?

231
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,333
- No, what?

232
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,333
- $5 per person.

233
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,400
(speaks in Italian)

234
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,467
- Ah Fung?

235
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,033
I went school with him.

236
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,567
His brother name Ah Chu.

237
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,733
(speaks in Italian)

238
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,667
- Ah Maron?

239
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,433
I don't know him.

240
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,933
(funky music)

241
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,267
- Help. Help!

242
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:47,767
- Hey!

243
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:51,767
Break up.

244
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,433
Lady, give that
man his purse back.

245
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:58,100
- It's my purse, he's the thief.

246
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,933
- What you doin'
around here, man?

247
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:03,000
And where you from
and what you want?

248
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,667
- With my right foot, I
can knock out that knife.

249
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:12,300
With my left I can
kick your nose.

250
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,700
With this hand, I can
poke out your eyes.

251
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,567
With this, I can
break your neck.

252
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,467
Take a good look at my face.

253
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm an oriental.

254
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,767
(hisses)

255
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,467
- It's cool, bro.

256
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,467
I don't want to trouble
this time, it's cool.

257
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:35,367
But next time, it's gon' be me

258
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,000
and you.

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,967
- I don't wanna see your
face in this area again.

260
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,467
(tense music)

261
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,067
(country music)

262
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Arrivederci.

263
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:04,733
- How many time I
got to tell you,

264
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,400
arrivederci, she
means goodbye, huh?

265
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,633
- Sometimes

266
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,867
I don't know if I'm
coming or going.

267
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,433
- What do you got in the box?

268
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,633
- Oh, some noodles for Genele.

269
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,567
- (Speaks in Italian) Maria!

270
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,167
Maria.

271
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,500
For Genele, huh.

272
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:23,933
Say, you look a little
pale, how 'bout a beer, huh?

273
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:24,933
- Hey, baby.

274
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,100
Hey, check it out. Woo.

275
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,267
- Hi.

276
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:38,733
- Hello.

277
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,233
Oh, you look so beautiful.

278
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:41,633
Are you from New York.

279
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:44,767
- No, but I am
drinking a Manhattan.

280
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,667
Is that close enough
to New York for ya?

281
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,333
- No, I gotta go there.

282
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,667
You see, my grandfather
had a dying wish.

283
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,200
- And, what was that?

284
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,067
- To stay alive.

285
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,000
He said I must go to New
York, find this woman.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,133
My grandfather loved her.

287
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:02,233
She's gonna take care of
me if she's still there.

288
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,167
- My name's Anita, what's yours?

289
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,500
- They call me Bruce.

290
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,233
- You mean, like Bruce Lee.

291
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,567
- Yeah, who else?

292
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,500
- Then you must know kung fu.

293
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,400
- Oh yeah, I once stepped in it.

294
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,667
(laughs)

295
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,100
- Hey.

296
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,633
If you're lookin' for Mister
Right, I'm right here.

297
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,367
- How 'bout some
Tequila, Sheila?

298
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,200
- To tell you the truth,

299
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm glad that you're
here to protect me.

300
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Those guys scare me.

301
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,500
- I can take those guys
out with one bare hand.

302
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,800
Stick with me, I'll
teach you self defense.

303
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,067
- Okay.

304
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,467
- Hey, eggroll.

305
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,400
We heard what you said.

306
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:48,300
- With my right foot, I
can knock out your face.

307
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,233
With my left, I
can kick your nose.

308
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:55,600
With this, I can
poke your eyes out.

309
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,233
With this I can break your neck.

310
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,500
Take a good look at my face.

311
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,767
I'm an oriental.

312
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:06,167
- I challenge you, sucker.

313
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,367
(bottle clatters)

314
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,700
- I gotta go to john.

315
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,800
Mexican beer.

316
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:14,800
I'll be back.

317
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,067
I'll be back, you guys.

318
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,033
Be prepared, you guys.

319
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,067
(tense music)

320
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:27,000
(pounds on door)

321
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
- Open the door, you creep.

322
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,033
(woman screams)

323
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,733
- Rape, rape!

324
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:33,633
Leave me alone!

325
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:34,567
(pounds on door)

326
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,700
- Come on, buddy, let's go!

327
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
(screams)

328
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,267
- I'm coming right
out, you guys!

329
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,633
(tank shatters)
(water gushes)

330
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,300
(woman screams)

331
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,467
Be prepared, you guys.

332
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,333
(somber music)

333
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,167
Bruce.

334
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,067
If I was half as good as you,

335
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,933
I could've fought
those guys in the bar.

336
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:19,200
And I would be with that girl.

337
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Bruce, you are the best.

338
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:32,600
I gotta eat more Mongolian beef.

339
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,967
(sighs)

340
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,633
(dreamy chimes)

341
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,200
(dramatic music)

342
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,100
(kick thuds)

343
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,133
(kicks thud)

344
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,600
(punches thud)

345
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,167
(shouting)

346
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,967
(punches thud)
(shouting)

347
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,533
(shouts)
(table clatters)

348
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:58,700
(shouts)
(chair clatters)

349
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,633
I'm gonna be just like you.

350
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,167
With hard training
and proper diet,

351
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm gonna be as fast as you are.

352
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,267
And strong as Rocky.

353
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,067
Rocky?

354
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:18,567
(Rocky theme)

355
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,333
Yes.

356
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:33,367
Diet.

357
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,733
Egg foo yung would be better.

358
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,333
(wok sizzles)

359
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,933
- May I help you?

360
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,667
- Yes, I wanna be
like Bruce Lee.

361
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,733
- We will start you
with a white belt.

362
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,600
- Oh, that's good.

363
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,433
- Mikey?

364
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,633
Give him a gi and a white belt.

365
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,733
Alright, everybody stretch.

366
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:22,567
Stretch.

367
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,467
Stretch to your right.

368
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,067
Stretch to your left.

369
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:27,900
Twist.

370
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,633
Stretch.

371
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,100
Come in.

372
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,867
You must have the right
spirit to guide you.

373
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,400
Inner peace.

374
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Control.

375
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,833
Patience.

376
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,767
It's all mental.

377
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,233
- My grandfather was
a mental patient.

378
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,667
My father was a mental patient.

379
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,333
And now it's my turn.

380
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,267
- Let me stress

381
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,033
inner peace.

382
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,667
Control.

383
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,000
And tranquility.

384
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:05,833
(phone rings)

385
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,667
Excuse me.

386
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
Hello, Dojo Studio.

387
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:21,733
What the hell you talking
about you son of a bitch?

388
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:23,633
I'll sue you for
every yen you have,

389
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,800
you stupid damn (shouts
in foreign language)!

390
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:32,200
As I was saying.

391
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,267
You have to have control.

392
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,033
With control comes
concentration.

393
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,900
You see the wall?

394
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,333
You can make a hole
through the wall if

395
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,833
you have concentration.

396
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,467
Try it, you can do it.

397
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,033
- I'm not gonna try it.

398
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:51,333
You try it.

399
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,633
- I'm not gonna try
it, I'm the master.

400
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:57,800
- Let's get Mikey,
he'll try anything.

401
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:03,600
Class, do you
think he can do it?

402
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,367
You see?

403
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,633
They don't think you can do it.

404
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:11,200
And I don't think you
can do it, either.

405
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,933
- You asked for it. (screams)

406
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,867
(loud crash)
(screams)

407
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:16,700
- [Man] What's going on?

408
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,167
What is this?

409
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,200
- Well, hi Master, you're
a little early today.

410
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,300
- [Man] Oh God,
come on, what is it?

411
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,067
- Mikey, Mikey, come
here for a second.

412
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,300
(woman giggles)

413
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,733
- [Man] Hey, what's
going on in here?

414
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,100
What is this, get out of
here, I'm gonna call the cops.

415
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,733
- It's all in the kya.

416
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:37,200
When you kya, you must bring
all energy from your body

417
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,100
into one focused point.

418
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:41,267
Kya!

419
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,200
Now, you try it.

420
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,933
Hmm.

421
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,067
- Kya!

422
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:56,233
(glass shatters)

423
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,533
- You?

424
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,100
- No, Memorex.

425
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,767
- Get out of my place.

426
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:02,000
You are hopeless.

427
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,967
- I must learn to be mental.

428
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,400
- You are mental.

429
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,733
- But I'm paying
you to teach me.

430
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,600
- I'll refund your money.

431
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,267
Change your clothes and get out!

432
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,567
- Whoa, you're very good.

433
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,600
Let me see.

434
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,867
It's natural for me.

435
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:31,633
I do that all the time
when I make a noodle.

436
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,467
See, oh, look at this.

437
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,067
Oh, Master.

438
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,067
Oh, I know how to do this.
- No, no!

439
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,933
(shouting)

440
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:42,033
(vase shatters)

441
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:44,033
- My vase, you broke it!

442
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,133
I will kill you.

443
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,433
- Master, you're out of control.

444
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:55,167
You sucker mother! (screams)

445
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,200
(dramatic music)

446
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,267
Now what?

447
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:04,967
- I wanna return your sticks.

448
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:06,367
- Keep them.

449
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,367
Go home and practice
in your closet.

450
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:55,133
- Are these eggs fresh?

451
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,600
- Hey, this is a stick up, man!

452
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,833
Hands up.

453
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,967
You, hurry up with
the money. Come on.

454
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,233
And don't do
nothin' stupid, huh.

455
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,567
(shouts)
(tense music)

456
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,500
(nunchucks whoosh
through the air)

457
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,667
(shouts)

458
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,400
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

459
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,867
It's not him.

460
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:32,967
He's not the robber.
He's the robber!

461
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:37,867
You should've seen this guy's
fantastic kung fu technique!

462
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,667
Unbelievable.

463
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,267
Like, he's so fast!

464
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,500
And powerful.

465
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,667
I'm tellin' ya, this guy
is Bruce Lee reincarnated.

466
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,900
- You even look like Bruce Lee.

467
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,200
- Well, with the proper
training and diet.

468
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,933
- Can you strike that
karate pose for the cameras

469
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:59,267
with the sticks over
your head, please.

470
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,000
Get that, Sherry.

471
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
(dramatic music)

472
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,033
- A Bruce Lee lookalike

473
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:09,567
put on a dazzling
show of kung fu.

474
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:13,333
An eyewitness said that the
gunman never had a chance

475
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,833
against the martial arts hero.

476
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:20,533
- Ciao boss.

477
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:21,600
I got the good news.

478
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,833
No, I got the great news.

479
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:27,267
You don't have to worry
about any more trouble.

480
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:31,133
I got a guy who's gonna
fix everything from now on.

481
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,800
I got a new delivery man.

482
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,033
They call him Bruce,
master of kung fu.

483
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:41,400
(dramatic music)

484
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,867
- Here comes the
guy in the paper.

485
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,467
This ain't like
the real Bruce Lee.

486
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,500
- Hey, man, I don't care
what the papers say.

487
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,267
You're still Brucey.

488
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,933
What are you lookin' at, Brucey.

489
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,200
You're nothin' but jive, man.

490
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,900
I can kick your ass
any day of the week.

491
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,367
- Kick my ass any day.

492
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:02,767
Well, I'm busy all week.

493
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:03,800
- Yeah, you're a phony, man.

494
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,233
You don't even know kung fu.

495
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,067
Get back.

496
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,600
What do you say to this, fool?

497
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,267
- If you must
fight, fight dirty.

498
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,867
Kick him in the groin.

499
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,533
Hit him with a rock.

500
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,033
Bite off his nose.

501
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,067
But, most of all,
use your brain.

502
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,833
Not fists.

503
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,433
- Oh, you're fantastic.

504
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:38,767
Who taught you that?

505
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:39,900
- Master Cho.

506
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,800
- Oh, we're acquaintances.

507
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,733
I study under Master Cho too.

508
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:46,333
Do you know the
martial art code?

509
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:50,800
It says pupil study under
same master must never fight.

510
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,733
- Yeah?

511
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:52,700
For real, huh?

512
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,533
- Yeah.

513
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,433
And that's too bad,
I can't beat you up.

514
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,500
- [Man With
Nunchucks] What code?

515
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,533
- Well, maybe he's right.

516
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,767
Let's forget about it.

517
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,500
- Yeah, I don't
study for Master Cho.

518
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,300
I study for Master Tung.

519
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,867
- Oh, that's great.

520
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:09,033
Then you two can fight.

521
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:11,267
And I personally
think that Master Cho

522
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,833
is 10 times better
than Master Tung.

523
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,133
- My master's better
than Master Cho.

524
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,100
- Hey, wait a minute, my
master's better then yours.

525
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,600
What are you talkin' about,
Master Tung is a pussy.

526
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,233
(punches thud)

527
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:24,267
- Yeah, yeah!

528
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,167
Hit him in the stomach.

529
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Hit him in the balls.

530
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,867
Hit him in the nose.

531
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,233
- Hey, look.

532
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,500
He's got nunchucks
in his pocket.

533
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,567
- Let's go check him out.

534
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,533
- Hey.

535
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,333
You got a permit to
carry those nunchucks?

536
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,167
- This?

537
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,000
You don't need no
permit for this.

538
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,133
- That's a lethal weapon,
you're under arrest.

539
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,733
- Wait a minute,
wait, wait a minute.

540
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,433
(bell rings)

541
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,433
These are my chopsticks.

542
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:10,967
I'm just a big eater.

543
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,767
Chopstick lickin' good.

544
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:27,500
(dramatic music)

545
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,267
- I sure hope this
is gonna work, boss.

546
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,767
You hope.

547
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,167
It better work of
the Boss of Bosses

548
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,733
is gonna make sashimi out of us.

549
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:50,200
- Hey, you can
count on me, boss.

550
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,367
I'm not gonna let ya down.

551
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,433
- Yeah, remember, Freddy.

552
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,167
You're the only one I can trust.

553
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,467
I cannot trust Big Al anymore.

554
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,900
- [Freddy] Yeah, well, there
have been rumors goin' around.

555
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,367
- What?

556
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:04,933
That Big Al thinks he's gonna
be boss of the West Coast?

557
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,733
That sneaky bastard will
never get my job. Never!

558
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,200
- Listen, boss,
nobody can tear down

559
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,900
a reputation like yours.

560
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,233
You're a good boy, Freddy.

561
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:18,433
You've always been a loyal,
trusted servant of la familia.

562
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:21,200
When you get back from this
job, I'm gonna promote you.

563
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,933
You're gonna be my consigliere.

564
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,233
- Really?

565
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:26,800
Like Robert Duvall?

566
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,933
- You gonna sit in Big Al's seat

567
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,767
at the other end of the table.

568
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,800
- I hope I don't have
to sit on his lap.

569
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,333
- Sit on his lap?

570
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,467
You make a joke?
- Yeah.

571
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:37,700
(laughs)

572
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,567
People say I got
no sense of humor.

573
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,500
Sit on his lap.
(laughs)

574
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,900
You make me laugh!

575
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,167
(laughter)

576
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,800
Hurry up, I don't wanna
miss Hollywood Squares.

577
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,300
- Oh boy, Florence Henderson.

578
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,200
- Florence Henderson.

579
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,000
Remember, no tell
Bruce about anything.

580
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,333
Alright?
- Yeah.

581
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:06,100
Make sure this
place is locked up,

582
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,600
because this stuff is worth
millions of dollars now.

583
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,467
- [Freddy] Yes, sir.

584
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:10,900
- That's it, huh?

585
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,900
(tense music)

586
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:39,167
- Put the barbells down,
I gotta talk to you.

587
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:41,800
- Look at you.

588
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,133
You've been eating
too much pasta.

589
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:48,367
Take that tie off and get down
here and work out with me.

590
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,533
- Carmen, put those
goddamn things down.

591
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,900
I got the plan set up.

592
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,000
- I hope this plan is
better than the last one.

593
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,300
If you wanna be boss
in the West Coast,

594
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,167
killing Pete's dog
isn't gonna do it.

595
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,267
- You know that poison
was meant for Little Pete.

596
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:07,267
How was I supposed to
know the dog likes cigars.

597
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:13,500
- So, what's your
plan this time, Rover.

598
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,867
- You know I love you just
before you get slapped.

599
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,533
(shouts)

600
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:23,267
(punch thuds)
(cries out)

601
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,933
Had enough?

602
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,733
You really know
how to hurt a guy.

603
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:28,067
Thanks, darling.

604
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,333
- Bad news from Africa.

605
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,300
Your brothers and sisters are
being killed for their ivory.

606
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,733
- Shut up and listen to me.

607
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:37,933
If I'm boss on this coast,

608
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,367
you'll be right
there alongside me.

609
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:43,100
You'd like that
power, wouldn't you?

610
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,367
Why'd you have to kick me?

611
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,700
You didn't have to kick me.

612
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,967
- Oh, I'm sorry, poor baby.

613
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:50,667
- Look, the Boss of Bosses

614
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,133
is going to
exterminate Little Pete

615
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,867
if one more job gets busted.

616
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,833
I know Little Pete's plan.

617
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,233
They're settin' up Bruce
as a delivery stooge.

618
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:59,367
You follow Bruce,

619
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:00,933
switch the coke whenever you can

620
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:02,700
before they get
to New York, okay?

621
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,000
Little Pete will be river moss,

622
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,600
and I'll be boss
of the West Coast.

623
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,767
(screams)

624
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:15,067
- You mean we will be
boss on the West Coast.

625
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,800
- That's what I said.

626
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:25,700
- Bruce.

627
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:32,167
You're a hero, I saw
you in the papers.

628
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,000
You're very brave.

629
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,367
Where'd you get your black belt.

630
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,800
- Oh, I got my black
belt in the Orient.

631
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,500
It was easy. Only written test.

632
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,233
- Do you have a girlfriend?

633
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,133
- I'm a sex object.

634
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:47,000
Every time I ask girls
sex, they object.

635
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,667
(laughs)

636
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,533
- Well, could I be
your girlfriend?

637
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:55,200
Listen, I'll give
you this necklace.

638
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,033
Here.

639
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,167
Let's go steady.

640
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay?

641
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,200
Now, as long as you wear this,

642
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,567
I'm not gonna make
love to another man.

643
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,867
- Me neither.

644
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:14,600
(laughs)

645
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,533
(dramatic music)

646
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,900
- [Pete] Bruce, I got
a new job for you.

647
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,233
- [Bruce] A new job?

648
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,100
- I'm givin' you a raise.

649
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,133
From now on, you get
the minimum wage.

650
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:27,433
- What do I gotta do, boss.

651
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:29,500
- Listen and I tell you.

652
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,167
Your spaghetti
recipe, it's famous.

653
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,133
I told all of my friends
all around the country

654
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,200
about your Chinese noodles.

655
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,867
And they're very anxious
to get this special flour.

656
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:43,033
So, I'm a send you to New York.

657
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:43,967
- New York?

658
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,467
More money and
going to New York?

659
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,967
- You got to learn
about America.

660
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:51,133
This is one great country.

661
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,467
- When do I start?

662
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:54,533
- What, you got
ants in your pants?

663
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:55,700
When I say so.

664
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,667
- How long does it take
to fly to New York?

665
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,933
- Wait a minute, not so fast.

666
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:04,100
First, you gotta stop
at different cities.

667
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,967
If you don't deliver the
flour to all of my friends,

668
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,800
you never get to New
York. Understand?

669
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,767
- I finally get
to go to New York.

670
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:15,467
- Freddy, he's
gonna chauffer you.

671
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,733
- Freddy?

672
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:17,733
My chauffer?

673
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,567
Why don't we want to fly?

674
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:21,733
- Fly?

675
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:23,500
When you fly, you see nothing.

676
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,833
But when you drive,

677
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,700
you get to know this
beautiful country.

678
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,867
Start packing.

679
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:30,967
Bruce, where you
get that necklace?

680
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,667
I never seen that on you before.

681
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:33,933
- Oh, this?

682
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:36,000
It was a gift from
my new girlfriend.

683
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,233
- Ah.

684
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:38,167
When you get back
from your trip,

685
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,967
maybe you get married, eh?

686
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,233
- Oh, I love get married.

687
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,067
But I hate to give
up my girlfriend.

688
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,767
- Bruce, tell us
about your girl.

689
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,767
- Oh, she's beautiful.

690
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,167
Sexy legs.

691
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,067
Really big eyes.

692
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:51,333
- Yeah, yeah?

693
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,367
Did you touch any?

694
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:54,733
(stutters)

695
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,633
- Easy, animal.

696
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,500
- [Bruce] She hugged me.
- [Freddy] Yeah?

697
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,667
- [Bruce] And she was moaning.
- [Freddy] Yeah, yeah?

698
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,133
- [Bruce] She tore my shirt off.

699
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:06,000
And scratched my back.
- Yeah?

700
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,700
Kissing my eye.

701
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,767
Kissing my nose.
- Yeah!

702
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:10,933
Breathing in my ear.

703
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:13,533
- [Freddy] So, was she good?

704
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,367
- [Bruce] I'm not sure.

705
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,200
I don't kiss and tell.

706
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,100
- This is serious.

707
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,800
Now, Bruce could lead us to
the head of this drug ring,

708
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,067
and you guys know it.

709
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,567
Now, we've got to
do whatever it takes

710
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,933
to get him to New York.

711
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:28,767
- Breathing in my ear?

712
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:36,900
- Bruce.

713
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,600
Be sure to deliver
all of the flour

714
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,267
and never let it
out of your sight.

715
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:44,433
Otherwise, you never
get to New York.

716
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:45,367
Freddy, he's gonna
keep an eye on you.

717
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:46,900
Right, Freddy?

718
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,600
- There's right, we're not
gonna let you down, boss.

719
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,233
- Oh, I wanna
capture this moment.

720
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,900
Say kimcheese.

721
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,067
- No, no, no. No pictures.

722
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,200
Just remember to never let the
flour out of your sight. Eh?

723
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,567
Alright, your first step is
Los Vegas, so enjoy yourself.

724
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,533
But, don't gamble unless Freddy
shows you how to do it, huh?

725
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,300
- I never gambled before.

726
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,200
I can't even say blackjack.

727
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,100
Goodbye, so long.

728
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,200
- Ciao, ciao.

729
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,100
Freddy, remember, drive
carefully on the road.

730
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,600
We can't afford accidents
or tickets, huh?

731
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,433
Good boy.

732
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,267
(tires squeal)

733
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,433
(screams)

734
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,000
(upbeat music)

735
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,000
- [Freddy] Ya-Ha, Los Vegas!

736
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,400
The town where
everybody's a winner!

737
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,733
Boy, look at these places.

738
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,800
- [Bruce] Where's
the Mustang Ranch?

739
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,333
My grandfather once
had a sweet there.

740
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,033
(laughs)

741
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:11,767
(dramatic music)

742
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,700
- Sy, Hy, listen up.

743
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,800
Boss of Bosses thinks he can
deliver powder in my town

744
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,867
without kickin' in, he's crazy.

745
00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:26,667
I want you should get
Lil Pete's deliveryman

746
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,467
and kill him if you have to.

747
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,267
But bring that powder to me.

748
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:34,367
Here, these are the
guys that you kill.

749
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:35,767
Intercept their cocaine

750
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,700
before it gets to the
Los Vegas connection.

751
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,433
Waste him before
they leave town.

752
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:44,267
- Be a pleasure, boss.

753
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:48,800
- Oh, and would you remind me
to call my mother on Tuesday.

754
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,133
(soft jazz)

755
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,533
- Hi.

756
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:58,367
Hi.

757
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,400
- Ah, thanks.

758
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,967
We heard a lot about you, Bruce.

759
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:09,767
The martial arts and
your special flour here.

760
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,300
- You want me to cook for you?

761
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,033
- No, we got our own
recipe for this flour.

762
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:17,500
Why don't you two
guys sit at the table.

763
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,833
- Oh, thank you.

764
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:26,367
- You guys must be thirsty
after such a long, hot trip.

765
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:28,033
Eh, Mr. Willinger.

766
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:30,300
Bring my friends ice cold beer.

767
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,733
- Do you know anything
about gambling?

768
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:32,633
- Gambling?

769
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,800
I met a woman who
made her husband

770
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,267
a millionaire by gambling.

771
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,533
- Really?

772
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:38,867
- Yeah, but he was
billionaire before.

773
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:40,400
- Hey, that's funny.

774
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I like that.

775
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,000
- I'm gonna teach ya
how to play blackjack.

776
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,767
Now, if you want another card,

777
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,400
you go like this, okay?

778
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,967
If you don't want another card,

779
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,600
then you go like that, alright?

780
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,833
Do what I do, ya got it?

781
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,433
Okay.

782
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:58,233
No, no.

783
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,567
- [Dealer] Cut the cards, sir.

784
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,333
- Just cut the cards.

785
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,233
- Kya!

786
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:08,167
(startled screams)

787
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,900
(Freddy sings)

788
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,967
- Hi there, wanna
have a good time?

789
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:16,200
- Ha ha, listen, baby, this guy,

790
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,300
he's just a wet noodle,
you know what I mean?

791
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,867
But me, I'm a caged tiger.

792
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:23,467
Why don't we go to the
penthouse for your penthouse.

793
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:25,533
- Penthouse. (laughs)

794
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:29,133
I'm always attracted
to men with big bucks.

795
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,000
Let's go, tiger.

796
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,233
The way you were dressed,

797
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,133
I thought you were
just a chauffer.

798
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:35,600
- But, he is a chauffer.

799
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,100
- I ain't no chauffer,
what, are you crazy?

800
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,500
Yeah, but you got great thighs.

801
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,567
(growls)

802
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,433
- Are you having bad luck?

803
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,667
- This machine only
know how to eat.

804
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,467
Must be constipated.

805
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:20,967
- Here.

806
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:23,867
Try this one for good luck.

807
00:42:23,867 --> 00:42:25,900
- You look so beautiful.

808
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,433
You from New York?

809
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:29,833
- No, sweetie, I'm from Ohio.

810
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,833
(machine dings)

811
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:37,667
- Ah!

812
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:43,767
Look at all this money!

813
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:46,033
- You hit the jackpot.

814
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:48,600
- I'm gonna be millionaire!

815
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,500
Thank you, grandfather!

816
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:58,867
Oh, no pocket.

817
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,567
What am I gonna do?

818
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:04,800
I got an idea.

819
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,600
(machine rings)

820
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:20,200
Put it in.

821
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,100
- Okay.

822
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:28,100
- Ah!

823
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:33,367
- How would you like to go
to a party with me, sugar?

824
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:34,367
- Party?

825
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:35,667
I love parties.

826
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,200
Who's party?

827
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,700
- Your party.

828
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,200
- I have no party.

829
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:43,100
- I'll make you a party.

830
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,933
- Oh, that must
be surprise party.

831
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:51,733
(funky music)

832
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,200
- Kya!

833
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,333
(shouting)
(punches thud)

834
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,933
- I'm dying.

835
00:44:07,933 --> 00:44:09,333
Call me a doctor!

836
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,267
- You're not bleeding.

837
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:17,900
Thank God, that knife
never touched you.

838
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,733
- Then call me a banker.

839
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:22,633
(sings in Italian)

840
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:40,800
(shouts)

841
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:46,600
(kick thuds)
(dramatic music)

842
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:53,667
(kicks thud)

843
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:58,433
- Listen to that.

844
00:44:58,433 --> 00:45:00,900
They must be havin' a good time.

845
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,067
- Hey, that's my partner Bruce!

846
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:07,300
Well, sounds like he found
something wild, did he?

847
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,833
- I'm just as wild as
any girl in this town.

848
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,167
(screaming)

849
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:17,533
(kicks and punches thud)

850
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:19,100
- You gotta give me more time!

851
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,200
- Times up.

852
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,967
And now we're in
the bonus round.

853
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:26,267
Listen, why don't
you have your friend

854
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:28,133
give you a few tips.

855
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:30,300
He must be incredible.

856
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,833
In fact, if he
ever has the time,

857
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:35,067
I'll give him a discount.

858
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:39,900
(kicks thud)
(dramatic music)

859
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,233
(screaming)

860
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,833
- What happened?

861
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:09,933
Are you sick or something?

862
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,633
- Okay, that's it!

863
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:12,533
That's it!

864
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:13,467
I've had enough.

865
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:14,367
Enough is enough.

866
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:15,800
It's, aw Jesus.

867
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,933
It's an obsession.

868
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:18,333
No more, no more.

869
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,333
Aw, jeez, two girls?

870
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,000
- No, there are
more girls comin'.

871
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,200
- (screams) I
can't take it, out.

872
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,600
Get out. Get out!

873
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,933
Right now, out.

874
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:30,167
Get outta here.

875
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:33,567
Get outta sight. Get
out, get out, get out.

876
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:35,967
I can't take it.
I can't take it!

877
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:36,833
Get out!

878
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,200
I don't want no more.

879
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,533
Get out of here!

880
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,033
Why, am I glad we're
out of that zoo.

881
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,667
- [Bruce] Did you learn
anything in Vegas?

882
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,100
It's showbiz.

883
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,867
Sammy Davis Junior. (laughs)

884
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:54,033
- [Freddy] Will you
take off those rings.

885
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:55,400
You look ridiculous.

886
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,733
Come on, take 'em
off, take 'em off.

887
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,567
Off, off, off, come on.

888
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,867
(siren wails)

889
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,733
Oh God, the cops.

890
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:11,733
Alright, now don't make trouble.

891
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:14,400
(speaks in Italian)

892
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,633
- [Bruce] Who loves ya, baby?

893
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:19,200
* And now the end is near

894
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,367
- Stop it, will ya just stop it?

895
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:21,400
Will ya just stop it?

896
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,700
- I'm just doing Frank Sinatra.

897
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,167
He did it his way.

898
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,167
* I did it sideways

899
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,467
- Alright, be cool, be cool.

900
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:33,333
You're cool, I'm cool.
You're cool, I'm cool.

901
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,400
God it's hot.

902
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,733
(laughs)

903
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:41,233
- [Cop] Howdy.
- [Freddy] Hi!

904
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,233
- You wanna show me
your driver's license.

905
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:45,833
- If you guys keep
taking it away,

906
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,267
how's he supposed
to show it to you?

907
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:50,833
- Is this car registered?

908
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,000
- No, this car Oldsmobile.

909
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,800
- Wanna show me
your registration.

910
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,700
- Yeah, right,

911
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,500
- You, speeder.

912
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,600
Sign right there.

913
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,567
- Sign.

914
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:07,733
You Libra, put down Libra.

915
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:13,800
- What are you on, drugs?

916
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,133
- No, officer...

917
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,400
- [Cop] You, shut up.

918
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,733
- That's groovy.

919
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,600
- Chinese boy got a funny mouth.

920
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,433
- Mm-Hmm.

921
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,300
- What you got in the bag?

922
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,133
- This?

923
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:30,200
This is famous Chinese flour.

924
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,800
The best recipe making noodles.

925
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,233
You should try some of this.

926
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:38,433
It's from mainland China.

927
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:39,667
Here, taste it.

928
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:49,267
- I hate Chinese food.

929
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:53,700
Half hour later
you hungry again.

930
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,767
- That's a good one, Clyde.

931
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:56,967
(laughs)

932
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,300
- That's a good one.

933
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,800
That's a good one.

934
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,500
- I don't get it.

935
00:49:06,267 --> 00:49:09,100
- Boy, you look like
an illegal alien.

936
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,233
You got yourself a green card?

937
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:12,767
- No, I god blue card.

938
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,567
- Well, I guess that's it.

939
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:16,533
We better be goin',
thank you very much.

940
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:17,833
Have a nice day.

941
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,667
And, as a token
of our friendship.

942
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:24,333
I want you to have this.

943
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,667
- You want us to have this.

944
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,500
- Yeah, and there's plenty
more where it come from.

945
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,033
- No, he doesn't mean that.

946
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:35,833
Tell him you don't
mean that, Bruce.

947
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,267
- I sure mean that.

948
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:38,533
Keep it.

949
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:41,433
- I believe the Chinese
boy offerin' us a bribe.

950
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:42,333
- Kinda looks like it.

951
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,400
- No, no, no.

952
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,867
- [Cop] Get out of the car.

953
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:49,500
Get out of the car now.

954
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,833
(laughs)

955
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:52,133
- You can't bribe us.

956
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,367
- At least not for nickles.

957
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,100
(jazzy music)

958
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,633
- Could you help me?

959
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:05,367
I think I've got a slow
leak in my rear tire.

960
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,267
- I'll be more than glad
to help you out, ma'am.

961
00:50:11,267 --> 00:50:13,267
- Did you say you think
you got a slow leak, ma'am?

962
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:16,000
- Well, I don't know
anything about cars.

963
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,733
But I do know about
practically everything else.

964
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:21,600
- I bet you do.

965
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,267
- Get the hell in the car.

966
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:24,100
- I'm hip.

967
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,933
- Get in the car.

968
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:26,533
- Hip, hip.

969
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:30,700
(punches thud)
(shouting)

970
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,367
- Give them some chloroform
and put them in the patrol car.

971
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:37,533
That should buy some time.

972
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:45,433
(engine bangs)

973
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:57,467
(shouting)

974
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,800
(horn blares)

975
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,867
- [Bruce] Freddy, that Toyota
didn't even stop for me.

976
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:10,533
I was once run over by a Toyota.

977
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,133
Oh, what a feeling.

978
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,833
- [Freddy] Look, we can't
waste much time, you know.

979
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,000
The cops'll be on our
neck any minute now.

980
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
(grunts) That's got it.

981
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,833
(shouting)

982
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,067
(clanging)

983
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:22,000
Oh, Jesus.

984
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,733
- [Bruce] It's an attack.

985
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:23,900
Attack!

986
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,433
Attack!

987
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:28,133
(shouting)

988
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:29,700
- Hey!

989
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,533
Hey!

990
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,200
- Kung fu cowboy?

991
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,433
- Looks like you got yourself

992
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:42,733
in a heap of trouble
there, partner.

993
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,500
Or, did you just marry a cop?

994
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,767
- Excuse me.

995
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:47,033
Do you happen to
know a blacksmith

996
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:49,133
or somebody around
who can get this

997
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:50,733
bracelet off my friend.

998
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,100
- I'll do better
than that for ya.

999
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,733
Hold your arm out
straight there.

1000
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:58,433
(shouts)
(gun fires)

1001
00:51:58,433 --> 00:51:59,267
- Wow.

1002
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,333
- [Cowboy] See ya.
- [Bruce] Happy trails.

1003
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:07,500
(country music)
(cheering)

1004
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,033
- Well, Bruce.

1005
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:20,233
That takes care of
the Houston delivery.

1006
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:24,067
- Another job is over
now, it's a Miller time.

1007
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,267
(overlapping conversations)

1008
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,400
- [Man In Bar] Bonzai, huh?

1009
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,233
Hey.

1010
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,867
(laughs)

1011
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,167
- What's your pleasure?

1012
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,933
Cowboy? (laughs)

1013
00:52:53,933 --> 00:52:55,833
- Sake light.

1014
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:58,300
- Well, we don't
got no sake light.

1015
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,667
All we got is sake
natural. (laughs)

1016
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:04,800
- I come all the
way from California,

1017
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,400
and the only thing you
got is sake natural?

1018
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,133
It ain't bad.

1019
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,267
I'm surprised.

1020
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,767
(rumbling)

1021
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:30,933
(glass shatters)
(shouts)

1022
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,267
- I'm a two-fisted drinker.

1023
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:40,267
I like to drink and
punch people out.

1024
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:42,500
- Oh, I like to
drink and each sushi.

1025
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,333
- Susie?

1026
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:44,567
Susie's my girl.

1027
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:46,200
- Oh, you like sushi
like I like sushi?

1028
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,000
- Yeah, I like Susie.

1029
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,633
- I had sushi last night.

1030
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:53,133
You should eat sushi in the
morning, sushi in the evening,

1031
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:55,033
sushi for suppertime.

1032
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:57,333
Then you wouldn't be so fat.

1033
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:03,033
- What the hell's wrong
with you, China boy?

1034
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,467
What's your name?

1035
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:08,000
Wong or Dong?
(laughs)

1036
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,867
- They call me bruce.

1037
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:10,900
- Bruce?

1038
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,733
No, Bruce.

1039
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:17,300
- Well, I tell you what, Bruce?

1040
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,733
I'm gonna put bruises
all over your body.

1041
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,533
- If you can snatch this
pebble from my hand,

1042
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:30,233
then you are ready.

1043
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:34,533
- Grandfather, there is
big bird over your head.

1044
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:36,900
(laughs)

1045
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,833
- I'm not gonna fall
for that old trick.

1046
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:43,700
(bird caws)

1047
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,800
(laughs)

1048
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:53,800
(country music)

1049
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:09,433
(jazzy music)

1050
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:17,033
(punches thud)
(country music)

1051
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:36,933
(sword whooshes through the air)

1052
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:41,733
(chair clatters)

1053
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:50,700
(shouts)

1054
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,200
(punch thuds)

1055
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,600
(kick thuds)

1056
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:05,500
(punches thud)

1057
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,800
(groaning and shouting)

1058
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,267
(punches thud)

1059
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,500
(screams)

1060
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:31,167
(shouts)
(punch thuds)

1061
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:35,333
- Ooh, punchin' doggies.
(sirens wail)

1062
00:56:39,967 --> 00:56:42,033
(shouts)

1063
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:48,633
- Let's get out of here.

1064
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:56,867
- Holy turd.

1065
00:56:58,467 --> 00:56:59,800
- Anybody drunk?

1066
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,400
I wanna arrest somebody.

1067
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,467
- Hey, guys, let's wait
til they throw up here.

1068
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:05,900
I hate to clean up the jail.

1069
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,700
(gun fires)

1070
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,133
- Well, don't just stand
there, arrest somebody.

1071
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,867
- You guys, shut the hell up.

1072
00:57:14,867 --> 00:57:16,133
- He ain't with us.

1073
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,567
- I thought he was.

1074
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,767
If Stephen hadn't been tryin'
to steal the furniture,

1075
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:20,933
we wouldn't be in here.

1076
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:22,533
- What are you lookin' at?

1077
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:24,733
Haven't you seen a
guy in a jail before?

1078
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,533
You're lucky, these
iron bars in the way.

1079
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:31,033
I'll finish you punks
off another time.

1080
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:33,033
- When I get out of here,

1081
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:36,567
I'm gonna squash
your face. Truth.

1082
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:38,767
- Hey, this food sucks.

1083
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:41,500
- How 'bout some mashed taters?

1084
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,667
- Gee wiz, I've got
a riot on my hands.

1085
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,933
What am I supposed
to do about it?

1086
00:57:46,933 --> 00:57:49,000
- Serve real food, fat face.

1087
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,833
- Now listen, Stephen, I don't
have to take that from you.

1088
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,033
- Oh, I got an idea.

1089
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:55,367
Why don't I make my
famous Chinese noodles?

1090
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:57,633
- Oh, my favorite
dish is moo goo gai.

1091
00:57:57,633 --> 00:58:00,000
- Your favorite dish
is some young guy.

1092
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,467
(laughs)

1093
00:58:01,467 --> 00:58:03,833
- I have a very special
flour right here in my bag.

1094
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,233
- Gee, I don't know.

1095
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:07,100
- [Prisoners] The guard
sucks. The guard sucks.

1096
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,867
The guard sucks.
The guard sucks.

1097
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:11,033
The guard sucks.
The guard sucks.

1098
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:13,367
The guard sucks.
The guard sucks.

1099
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:16,667
The guard sucks.
The guard sucks.

1100
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,967
The guard sucks.
- Stop it!

1101
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:22,067
- I'll let him go in and
cook in the jail's kitchen.

1102
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:23,633
- Alright, alright.

1103
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,000
- You got microwave wok?

1104
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,467
- I don't think
this is a good idea.

1105
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:31,533
- Pretty face, stay out of this.

1106
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:32,933
- Look, you don't understand.

1107
00:58:32,933 --> 00:58:35,533
This is very expensive flour.

1108
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:38,133
We can't afford to waste
it on a bunch of prisoners.

1109
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:39,233
- Don't be selfish.

1110
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:41,733
Guard, take me to the kitchen.

1111
00:58:42,567 --> 00:58:43,633
Let go!

1112
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:44,833
(dramatic music)

1113
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:46,033
(coughs)

1114
00:58:46,033 --> 00:58:47,833
- Look what you did!

1115
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:50,567
The boss is gonna kill me!

1116
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:52,667
(sniffs)

1117
00:58:55,267 --> 00:58:58,633
- The more I inhale, I
wanna be an astronaut.

1118
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:00,300
- Well, the more I inhale

1119
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,900
the more sick and tired
I get of your face.

1120
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,567
All of your faces.

1121
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:07,067
Everybody go home.

1122
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:18,500
Let's go catch us
some real criminals.

1123
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,267
(cheering)

1124
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:22,300
- Now you're talking, yeah!

1125
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,967
- Will you excuse
me for a moment?

1126
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:24,867
- Go ahead.

1127
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:32,000
- Man you have enough on
that arm for a condominium.

1128
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,467
In Florida.

1129
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:34,300
- Hang on.

1130
00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:38,000
You still got that M&M?
- Yeah.

1131
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,267
Let's peel 'em and eat him.

1132
00:59:41,267 --> 00:59:43,300
And then we'll drive to Europe.

1133
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,133
Come on.

1134
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:49,100
* The yellow rose of Texas
(siren wails)

1135
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,100
* Is the only gal for me

1136
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,233
- Where's that special little
geisha, I was in Texas.

1137
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:57,167
- There's one up the
road here, we'll take ya.

1138
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:59,467
- Oh yeah, I gotta
have some sushi.

1139
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:00,867
- Sushi?

1140
01:00:00,867 --> 01:00:05,033
* You know sushi
like I know sushi

1141
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,533
* Sushi in the morning,
sushi in the evening

1142
01:00:08,533 --> 01:00:10,233
* Sushi in the summertime

1143
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:14,400
(screaming)
(tires squeal)

1144
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:18,100
(cheering)

1145
01:00:20,067 --> 01:00:22,400
- [Bruce] Freddy,
where are you going?

1146
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,700
- I'm gonna ride to the bridge
where the west commences.

1147
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,267
I'm gonna find my new horizons.

1148
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:31,433
(cheers)

1149
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,067
Make way for the new
Italian stallion.

1150
01:00:35,067 --> 01:00:38,400
Sylvester Stallone,
each your heart out!

1151
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:40,867
(tires squeal)

1152
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:43,533
(country music)

1153
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,200
There must be a better
way to get in your jeans.

1154
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:54,867
- Chicago is my town.

1155
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:56,967
Nobody delivers coke
to my territory.

1156
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:59,633
Two of Lil Pete's guys
are comin' into town.

1157
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:01,700
I wanna get those guys.

1158
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,300
I want them killed.

1159
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,767
How ya gonna do it?

1160
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:09,433
- Well,

1161
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:10,267
we could,

1162
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,900
we could slit his
throat from ear to ear.

1163
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,733
Or, perhaps you're
looking for something

1164
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:21,800
a little bit less bloody.

1165
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,067
I could throw a flying
star between his eyes.

1166
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:31,600
(laughs)

1167
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,167
Ooh!

1168
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,600
Or, we could just drown them.

1169
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:39,533
Slam dunk!

1170
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:41,567
(water splashes)

1171
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:42,400
- Yeah!

1172
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,267
- Of course,

1173
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:51,233
maybe you're into a
little torture first.

1174
01:01:51,233 --> 01:01:55,400
For that, we have a whole new
line of this year's gag balls.

1175
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,167
Gag balls.

1176
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:00,333
And we have leather whips.

1177
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,200
(laughs)

1178
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,100
I love the whips part.

1179
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,000
(whip snaps)

1180
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,233
The name's Toby!

1181
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:10,267
The name's Toby!

1182
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:12,733
No, no, Kunta Kinte,

1183
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:13,867
Your name's Toby!

1184
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:15,200
That's for Suzy Chapstick.

1185
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,967
And that's for meat byproducts.

1186
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,667
And that's for
Lucciano Pavorati.

1187
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:21,167
And that's for
people that stop on

1188
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:23,167
entrance ramps of freeways.

1189
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:24,067
The name's Toby.

1190
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,767
No, no, Kunta Kinte.

1191
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,200
That's for the Village People.

1192
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,167
That's for nondairy creamers.

1193
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:32,000
And that's for heehaw!

1194
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,300
You're name's Toby.

1195
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,100
Yes, yes, my name is Toby.

1196
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,933
Help me! (laughs)

1197
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:48,067
Of course there's
always castration.

1198
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,467
Of course, if you want some
more conventional method.

1199
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:58,600
This gun and silencer
is just dandy.

1200
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:03,967
(gun fires)

1201
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,800
(laughs)

1202
01:03:08,933 --> 01:03:11,433
(Asian music)

1203
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:19,733
- I hope everything is prepared
for the arrival of my guest.

1204
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:22,233
Look, I want you to
make him feel at home.

1205
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:24,733
He's a very important visitor.

1206
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:26,667
Go all out.

1207
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,300
- [Freddy] Well, Bruce,
we're in Chicago.

1208
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,333
One more delivery, and we're
on our way to New York.

1209
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:38,767
- [Bruce] My grandfather told
me he had a friend in Chicago.

1210
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:40,133
Al Capone.

1211
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:43,500
- [Freddy] (laughs)
Never heard of him.

1212
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,867
- Bruce has arrived, sir.

1213
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:47,700
- Tell him to come in.

1214
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,567
(giggles)

1215
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:54,633
- Howdy, folks.

1216
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:57,100
- Welcome.

1217
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,367
- What is this?

1218
01:04:00,533 --> 01:04:01,633
- Give me a hug!

1219
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:04,133
- Oh, sure. Welcome.

1220
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:04,967
Oh, of course.

1221
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:06,533
Welcome.

1222
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:08,467
(hums)

1223
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:40,300
(shouts)
(punch thuds)

1224
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,567
- That's for jello pudding.

1225
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:44,067
That's for bagpipes.
(punches thud)

1226
01:04:44,067 --> 01:04:46,900
That's for pina coladas.

1227
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
That's for kitty litter.

1228
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:54,400
(whip whooshes through the air)

1229
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,667
- I love sushi.

1230
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:57,467
Seaweed.

1231
01:04:58,467 --> 01:04:59,300
Octopus.

1232
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:03,833
But who ordered that fly?

1233
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:10,367
(fly buzzes)

1234
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:13,767
(shouts)

1235
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:18,533
I as a samurai warrior,
but I gave it up.

1236
01:05:18,533 --> 01:05:20,667
- [Woman] You were
a samurai warrior?

1237
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,033
Why did you quit?

1238
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:22,867
- Union problems.

1239
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:25,633
(dramatic music)

1240
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:30,367
- You say you're
a samurai warrior,

1241
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,600
but the fly is still alive.

1242
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,933
- But that fly will
never make love again.

1243
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,967
(giggles)

1244
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,367
- After dinner, I'll
give you a massage.

1245
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:41,600
Would you like that?

1246
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,467
- Massage?

1247
01:05:42,467 --> 01:05:44,400
I like massage.

1248
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,533
In fact, my first
time in America,

1249
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:48,833
I worked at massage parlor.

1250
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:49,833
They fired me.

1251
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:50,833
- What for?

1252
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,867
- Rubbing people the wrong way.

1253
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,367
(tense music)

1254
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,933
(moans)

1255
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,000
(punch thuds)

1256
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:31,067
- Ah, that's good.

1257
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:33,800
Harder.

1258
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,033
Harder.

1259
01:06:37,133 --> 01:06:37,967
Ah.

1260
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,233
Ah.

1261
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,400
(groans)

1262
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,433
Oriental women walk five
feet behind the men.

1263
01:06:49,433 --> 01:06:52,033
American men walk all over men.

1264
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:57,700
You think you're going
to give me acupuncture.

1265
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,433
Now I really need it.

1266
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,000
(tense music)

1267
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:08,567
(moans)

1268
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:09,400
Ooh, ooh.

1269
01:07:11,133 --> 01:07:11,967
Whoa, whoa.

1270
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:12,933
What are you doing?

1271
01:07:12,933 --> 01:07:14,533
- I'm playing doctor.

1272
01:07:14,533 --> 01:07:16,633
- Doctor, I'm fine down there.

1273
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:17,967
Pain it up here.

1274
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,300
(groans)

1275
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,000
(phone rings)

1276
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:46,800
- Hello.

1277
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,900
- Big Al?

1278
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,933
It's me.

1279
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:50,267
- Carmen, baby.

1280
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:52,133
You didn't screw
up again, did ya?

1281
01:07:52,133 --> 01:07:53,367
- I got the bag.

1282
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:54,600
I switched them.

1283
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,533
They have the real flour
and we have the stuff.

1284
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,933
- Oh, you're beautiful, baby.

1285
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:04,167
And Little Pete, he's
gonna get the ax.

1286
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:07,933
- You're not gonna forget about
me and our plans, are you?

1287
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,567
- Oh, of course not, kiddo.

1288
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:11,633
I want you to come
back here right away.

1289
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,133
And be careful.

1290
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:16,500
You're carrying enough powder
to get all of Chicago high.

1291
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,100
(whip snaps)
(shouts)

1292
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,367
- I'm so excited, Al.

1293
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:21,333
Finally, our dreams
are gonna come true.

1294
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,033
(whip snaps)
(grunts)

1295
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:25,800
(dramatic music)

1296
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:56,000
- What is he doing, boss?

1297
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,700
- Just checking
your Chinese flour.

1298
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:02,200
- You don't need him,
I'm the real expert.

1299
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,533
- This is flour.

1300
01:09:08,533 --> 01:09:09,433
- Yes, sir.

1301
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:13,833
My test shows this
is genuine flour.

1302
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:18,033
And a very good grade I may add.

1303
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:24,833
- I'm not paying
you to be a joker.

1304
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,600
Now, if your life
depended on it.

1305
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:30,633
And it does.

1306
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,200
Do you swear that
this stuff is flour.

1307
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,867
- Sir, I'm positive.

1308
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:43,667
- I want you out
of this room now.

1309
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,933
- Yes, sir.

1310
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,333
- Freddy.

1311
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,633
Freddy, Freddy.

1312
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,833
Ah, Freddy.

1313
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:02,200
You know what this
means, don't you, Freddy?

1314
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,700
- Goodbye, Freddy.

1315
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:14,967
- I know what that means.

1316
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:17,000
That means kiss of death.

1317
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,800
I've seen Godfather movie.

1318
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,267
But, I hate to tell
you this, Boss.

1319
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:24,167
You don't kiss as
good as Marlon Brando.

1320
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:26,267
Now you gonna kiss me too?

1321
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:28,700
- You shall die by my bullet,

1322
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:33,600
because that's as much
as I can do for you.

1323
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,100
(tense music)

1324
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:43,333
(screams)

1325
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:50,167
- Freddy, come on.

1326
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,000
- Get him!

1327
01:10:53,933 --> 01:10:56,233
(guns fire)

1328
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,733
(shouting)

1329
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:10,867
- Go, go, go, go.

1330
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,333
Go now, go now, go, go, go, go.

1331
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,933
Don't wait, go, go.

1332
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,500
- Lady, please help me.

1333
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,900
There are gangsters after me.

1334
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,833
- Gangsters?

1335
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,867
What happened?

1336
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:10,300
- I can't explain.

1337
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,633
Would you hide me someplace?

1338
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:29,567
- We're lookin' for an
Oriental, you seen him?

1339
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:33,767
- (laughs) If you are referring
to a particular person

1340
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,633
of the Asian Mongolian race,

1341
01:12:36,633 --> 01:12:40,933
they are not indigenous
to this propinquity.

1342
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:43,233
- What the hell is
she talking about?

1343
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:47,367
- She said there's no rice
peddlers in this neighborhood.

1344
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:48,933
- Yeah?

1345
01:12:48,933 --> 01:12:51,033
You don't mind if
we look around?

1346
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,633
- Do you have a search warrant?

1347
01:12:53,633 --> 01:12:55,633
I know my rights.

1348
01:12:55,633 --> 01:12:59,000
I happen to be a
law student at NYU.

1349
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,067
- Yeah, lady.

1350
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,367
This is our search warrant.

1351
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:05,867
(tense music)

1352
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:15,800
- Stop it!

1353
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,533
Stop it, you're
ruining my merchandise.

1354
01:13:18,533 --> 01:13:21,700
- You'll get reimbursed
in Hell, lady.

1355
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:29,233
- Stop it!

1356
01:13:29,233 --> 01:13:30,433
Stop it!

1357
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:32,767
- You got somethin' to hide?

1358
01:13:40,467 --> 01:13:41,433
- [Woman] I'll tell you!

1359
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:43,100
I'll tell you where he is!

1360
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,833
- [Gangster] Well,
why didn't you say so?

1361
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,967
- He's in the back room.

1362
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:48,433
- Excuse me.

1363
01:13:48,433 --> 01:13:49,433
- It's okay.

1364
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:22,367
- What are ya searchin' for?

1365
01:14:22,367 --> 01:14:24,100
What are ya searchin' for?

1366
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,767
I want you to tell me today.
- Amen!

1367
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:28,633
What are you searching for?

1368
01:14:28,633 --> 01:14:30,300
Come, look at me.

1369
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,233
Tell me.

1370
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,033
- I am searchin' for him.

1371
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:34,333
- [Parishioners] Amen!

1372
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,833
- Ask and it will be given you.

1373
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:39,200
Seek and you will find.

1374
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,533
Knock and it will
be open to you.

1375
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:43,433
Yeah, Amen.

1376
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:48,167
What are you searching for?

1377
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:50,400
- I want to be healed.

1378
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,333
- You're in the
wrong line, sister.

1379
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,733
Remember, children.

1380
01:14:57,733 --> 01:14:59,500
God gave us his love.

1381
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,567
And the Catholics gave
us bingo, hallelujah!

1382
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:06,600
- [Parishioners] Hallelujah!

1383
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,733
- [Priest] What are you
searching for, sister?

1384
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:10,333
- I'm looking for a man.

1385
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,500
- Tell us about him.

1386
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,133
Was he in your heart?

1387
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,333
- No, he was in my car.

1388
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:17,267
- Well, spiritually.

1389
01:15:17,267 --> 01:15:19,167
He is everywhere we go.

1390
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,667
And we call him Jesus.

1391
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,167
- No, I call him Freddy.

1392
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:25,733
- [Parishioners] Hallelujah!

1393
01:15:25,733 --> 01:15:27,600
- Why don't you turn around

1394
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,867
and share your
experience with us.

1395
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:32,267
- [Parishioners] Amen!

1396
01:15:32,267 --> 01:15:33,667
- Brothers and sisters.

1397
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:35,133
- [Parishioners] Amen!

1398
01:15:35,133 --> 01:15:38,333
- It all started
when I was a kid.

1399
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:41,500
I was raised by my grandfather.

1400
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,767
And we didn't have
no clothes, no food.

1401
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:48,033
We were so poor, one time
burglar broke into house.

1402
01:15:48,033 --> 01:15:49,800
We robbed him.
- Amen!

1403
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:52,033
- Amen.

1404
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:54,700
- But, seriously, folks.

1405
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:59,200
Today, people are so, what do
you call it, materialistic.

1406
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,433
- Materialistic.

1407
01:16:00,433 --> 01:16:02,167
- That's the word.

1408
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:06,767
- Money is not the most
important thing in life.

1409
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:09,333
- The most important
thing in life is broads.

1410
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:10,900
Broads!
- Amen!

1411
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,167
- [Parishioners] Broads?

1412
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,000
- Broads?

1413
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,933
- Sister, you cannot
say blasphemous things

1414
01:16:16,933 --> 01:16:18,633
in this holy church.

1415
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:19,867
Repent, repent!

1416
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:22,800
- Did I do something wrong?

1417
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,267
- Moony, moony, moony!

1418
01:16:25,267 --> 01:16:28,733
- [Parishioners] Moony,
moony, moony, moony!

1419
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:32,733
Moony, moony, moony,
moony, moony, moony, moony.

1420
01:16:34,867 --> 01:16:37,133
Moony, moony, moony, moony.

1421
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,967
Moony, moony, moony, moony.

1422
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,733
Moony, moony, moony, moony.

1423
01:16:42,733 --> 01:16:45,467
(dramatic music)

1424
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:55,700
- Peter, I mean, Freddy!

1425
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,267
- Run!

1426
01:16:57,267 --> 01:16:58,367
Run!

1427
01:16:58,367 --> 01:17:00,267
- Wait a minute.

1428
01:17:00,267 --> 01:17:02,333
- I'll take care of this.

1429
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:08,500
Say, blood, give me
five yo mamma get down.

1430
01:17:11,033 --> 01:17:13,200
- What you mean, yo mamma?

1431
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,633

01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:19,467
but you gotta get it
together. Do like I do.

01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:20,300
Say blood.

01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:24,600
- Say blood.
(laughter)

1435
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:26,967
- Say blood.

1436
01:17:26,967 --> 01:17:28,400
- Naw, say blood.

1437
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,300
- What's happenin'?

1438
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,033
- What's happenin'?

1439
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:35,200
- Say, foo, what's yo name.

1440
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,367
- Say, foo, they call me Bruce.

1441
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:39,533
- [Men] Bruce?

1442
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,533
- What's yours?

1443
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,100
- I'm Curtis.

1444
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,000
- Curtis, this fool be Freddy.

1445
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,200
- Curtis, it's a pleasure.

1446
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,800
I want you to know
you all run very fast.

1447
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,200
- We know that.

1448
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,633
- Yeah, so, what's your problem.

1449
01:17:52,633 --> 01:17:56,467
- Man, some dudes
chasin' us all over.

1450
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:58,767
And they're from mafia.

1451
01:17:58,767 --> 01:17:59,933
- [Men] Mafia?

1452
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:04,467
- So, what you need
is some protection.

1453
01:18:04,467 --> 01:18:05,367
- Right on!

1454
01:18:07,533 --> 01:18:09,767
- You all come from
us, we'll hide you.

1455
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:13,000
(overlapping dialogue)

1456
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,267
(buzzing)

1457
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:25,433
- Whoa!

1458
01:18:25,433 --> 01:18:28,267
What are these
stuff in this room?

1459
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:31,400
- They're some
electronic gadgets.

1460
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,767
- That's an electric chair.

1461
01:18:33,767 --> 01:18:37,933
- Yeah.
(Knocks on door)

1462
01:18:37,933 --> 01:18:40,667
Uh, must be Curtis
with the food.

1463
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,767
- Hi, Bruce.

1464
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:57,633
- [Bruce] Hello,
you look familiar.

1465
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,500
- May I come in?

1466
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,700
- [Bruce] Yes.

1467
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,700
- Thank you.

1468
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,500
Don't you recognize me?

1469
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,500
We met in Ginelli's bar.

1470
01:19:10,533 --> 01:19:11,367
- Oh.

1471
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,500
She's the lady who
gave me this necklace.

1472
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,267
(laughs)

1473
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:17,533
- Oh, yeah, you're the one

1474
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:19,333
with all the moanin'
and the kissin'

1475
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:22,333
and the breathin'
in his ear, huh?

1476
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:24,733
- Look, I'm a federal agent.

1477
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:26,433
- Oh my God.

1478
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:29,433
- The necklace I gave you
was an electronic microphone.

1479
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:31,067
We've monitored all
your conversations.

1480
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,167
We know your locations
all over the country.

1481
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,167
- Oh my God.

1482
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,600
- Can't you say
anything but oh my God?

1483
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,433
- They used you, Bruce.

1484
01:19:39,433 --> 01:19:41,267
You were their stooge.

1485
01:19:42,767 --> 01:19:43,867
You weren't delivering flour,

1486
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:46,033
you were delivering cocaine.

1487
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:47,900
Drugs, Bruce.

1488
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:48,733
- Drugs.

1489
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:51,933
Oh my Buddha.

1490
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,600
I've been delivering drugs.

1491
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh, forgive me.

1492
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:04,867
- Bruce, I was gonna tell ya.

1493
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:08,200
But, you know, I took an oath.

1494
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:13,067
- Don't blame Freddy.

1495
01:20:13,067 --> 01:20:14,233
If he'd said anything,

1496
01:20:14,233 --> 01:20:16,633
they would've
killed him and you.

1497
01:20:19,733 --> 01:20:21,800
- I took an oath too.

1498
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,967
For Bruce Lee.

1499
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:26,633
Now I have disgraced him.

1500
01:20:26,633 --> 01:20:28,033
- Not yet.

1501
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:30,233
You can still make
up for everything.

1502
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:32,333
We'll get an amnesty for Freddy.

1503
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,733
I need your help.

1504
01:20:36,733 --> 01:20:39,867
- Now you want me
to be your stooge?

1505
01:20:39,867 --> 01:20:41,933
- If we can catch these guys,

1506
01:20:41,933 --> 01:20:44,133
we can stop the
entire distribution

1507
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:46,833
of all the drugs
in the underworld.

1508
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:49,467
When we do that, we
can find your lady.

1509
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:51,900
But, I need your help, Bruce.

1510
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,400
- I must help you.

1511
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:57,633
That's all there is to say.

1512
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:02,433
(tense music)

1513
01:21:10,067 --> 01:21:11,133
- Here we go.

1514
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:15,600
- Well, well, Freddy.

1515
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,200
Now, I'm glad to see that you've
decided to make up for your

1516
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,700
unhealthy mistake.

1517
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,200
Where is it?

1518
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,600
- If we give it to you
know, you'll kill us.

1519
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,433
- Freddy.

1520
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,033
You're already a dead man.

1521
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:32,233
- Well, Bruce.

1522
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:34,467
I guess you'd better
give it to him.

1523
01:21:34,467 --> 01:21:35,967
- You see?

1524
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:38,400
You're braver than I thought.

1525
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,133
Hey, where is it?

1526
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:44,833
- Kya!
(Dramatic music)

1527
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:49,000
(kicks and punches thud)
(shouting)

1528
01:21:58,067 --> 01:22:01,267
- [Freddy] Hey, Bruce,
the enemy went that way!

1529
01:22:01,267 --> 01:22:05,033
(punches and kicks thud)

1530
01:22:05,033 --> 01:22:07,533
(sirens wail)

1531
01:22:16,467 --> 01:22:19,067
(punches thud)

1532
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:24,567
- [Cop] Hold it, freeze!

1533
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,633
- Move it, on the
car, on the car!

1534
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:40,100
- Hello, Boss.

1535
01:22:42,967 --> 01:22:44,800
I hope you like the
food in hoosegow

1536
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,967
Otherwise I'll have to bring
Chinese noodles for you.

1537
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,167
Freddy, wait.

1538
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,100
- Oh, man, Bruce,
what do you want?

1539
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:04,667
- I want you to have this.

1540
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:05,833
- Aw, no, man.

1541
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:12,500
- So I always know
where my best friend it.

1542
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,400
- You make me laugh, you know,
you always make me laugh.

1543
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,400
(speaks in Italian)

1544
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:27,000
Come on, driver, let's go, huh?

1545
01:23:28,733 --> 01:23:30,000
You think there's
a bar around here

1546
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,600
or somethin' on the way, maybe?

1547
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:36,533
- Arrivederci.

1548
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:49,900
- Well, according to
this, that's the lady.

1549
01:23:50,867 --> 01:23:52,800
- That's the lady?

1550
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,533
- No, darling.

1551
01:23:54,533 --> 01:23:56,500
That's the lady.

1552
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,333
(patriotic music)

1553
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:02,067
- Wow.

1554
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:05,367
My grandfather was right.

1555
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:08,400
She is the most beautiful
lady in the world.

1556
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,900
- Your grandfather
meant America.

1557
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,267
America will take care of you.

1558
01:24:13,267 --> 01:24:14,100
Come on.

1559
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:19,933
- Bruce.

1560
01:24:21,467 --> 01:24:24,133
Don't forget the most
important thing in life.

1561
01:24:24,133 --> 01:24:27,800
