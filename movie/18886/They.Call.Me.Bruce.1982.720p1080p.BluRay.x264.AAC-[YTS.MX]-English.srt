Grandfather, Grandfather.

33
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:24,667
I couldn't get a doctor.

34
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,170
- Son.

35
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,809
- Grandfather, please don't die.

36
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,315
- I must go a way for a while.

37
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:34,689
- I'll make you proud of me.

38
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,160
When I grow up, I'll make lots of money.

39
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:39,500
- Let me tell you, Grandson,

40
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,376
money is not the
most important thing in life.

41
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:48,585
The most important thing is

42
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,822
broads. Broads!

43
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,733
Don't you ever forget it.

44
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,471
- If you die, Grandfather,

45
00:03:57,472 --> 00:04:00,243
there will be nobody to take care of me.

46
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:02,113
- Go America.

47
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:03,183
- America?

48
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:04,019
- Yes.

49
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:09,064
- Long time ago,
when I was a merchant marine.

50
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:14,943
In New York,
I met the most beautiful lady in the world.

51
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,223
I fell in love with her.

52
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:24,529
When you find her,

53
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,570
she'll take care of you.

54
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,375
- How can I find her?

55
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,246
- Here.

56
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,485
Take this.

57
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:36,723
It'll help you.

58
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:42,802
I don't know if she's still there.

59
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,112
If you find her,

60
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,884
tell her

61
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,922
I loved her.

62
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,698
Yes, I'll...

63
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,702
Grandfather?

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,500
Bruce, I like some more sauce, huh?

65
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:31,005
- Boss, why do you keep calling me Bruce?

66
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:32,241
I'm Joon.

67
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:33,478
Bruce was the champ.

68
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,948
- I don't care, champ or no champ,

69
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,618
I'm callin' you Bruce,
and when I call you Bruce,

70
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,757
you are Bruce, you understand?

71
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:40,126
Besides, you all look alike anyway.

72
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:44,601
It's true!

73
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,538
- Can he really do
that karate stuff real good?

74
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,474
- Bruce?

75
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:48,978
Nah, he can't even chop a liver.

76
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,218
Oh, God.

77
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,558
- Mm, hey Bruce, the sauce is wonderful.

78
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,164
What's your secret, huh?

79
00:05:58,165 --> 00:05:59,001
- Dog meat.

80
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:01,973
It's a joke.

81
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,578
But seriously, folks,

82
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,550
I make the best spaghetti in the world,

83
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,557
with a special flour from mainland China.

84
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:12,962
You see, 5,000 years ago,

85
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,934
Chinese invented the noodle.

86
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,871
And Marco Polo came to China,

87
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,541
and took it back to Italy,

88
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,346
and it becomes spaghetti.

89
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,220
And I can even sing Italian song.

90
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:25,157
Oh yeah?

91
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,194
- Rico, how are you, my friend.

92
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:01,399
- Bon journo, Capo, you're looking well.

93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,371
- I feel good.

94
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,275
- Come, join me in this feast.

95
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:06,746
- No, excuse me.

96
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:10,755
I promised the wife, Nicola,
dinner at home tonight.

97
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:13,526
- Rico, you brought me somethin'?

98
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,307
- You're gonna like this.

99
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:21,144
It's pure.

100
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,521
- You have the right to remain silent.

101
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:15,828
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

102
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,063
in a court of law.

103
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,432
Uh...

104
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,236
Dammit, what's the next line?

105
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:21,641
- And the right to seek council.

106
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:22,876
- Oh yeah, thanks.

107
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,112
You have the right to an attorney.

108
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:27,285
In the event you cannot afford one, uh,

109
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:28,188
I'm available.

110
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:37,106
Hare Krishna.

111
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:38,209
Hare Krishna.

112
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:40,248
Hare, hare.

113
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,055
- Many pardon.

114
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,458
But we are lost.

115
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,526
Where's Disney Land?

116
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,430
- Do we look like Mickey Mouse?

117
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:49,267
- Ah, so.

118
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,910
Ah, Mickey Mouse.

119
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:58,420
- Hey, get out of here.

120
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:05,534
Hare Krishna.

121
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,437
Hare, Hare.

122
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,243
Hare Krishna.

123
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,214
Hare, hare.

124
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,419
Hare Krishna.

125
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,191
Hare Krishna.

126
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,932
- Care for a flower, sir.

127
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,401
- Hey, we carry our own flower.

128
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:23,073
You just pray for us.

129
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,654
- I can't stand this anymore.

130
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:48,627
- I'm taking off this one too.

131
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:49,462
- Me too!

132
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:52,102
You're under arrest.

133
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:53,705
You have the right to remain silent.

134
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:54,941
- He's out cold.

135
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,110
You better give him mouth to mouth

136
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,216
and make this bust legal.

137
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,253
- Thanks, I needed that.

138
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:20,328
- We're losin' the men to
these federal agent busts.

139
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,701
We need the solutions now.

140
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,337
- We can bribe the FBI.

141
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:27,511
- We'll give them our brand of cigars.

142
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,947
Dynamite.

143
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:31,987
Let's infest in bulletproof Gucci loafers.

144
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:34,494
- Hey, I got an original idea.

145
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:39,270
Let's just make them an
offer that they can't refuse.

146
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,747
Offer our mother-in-laws, eh?

147
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,020
- Boss, enough.

148
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,824
What do you mean the
boss to think that this is?

149
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,527
Monkey business?

150
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,866
- Maybe there's a leak in the system.

151
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,370
You can't trust anybody, can ya, Pete.

152
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,308
- You the one to know about the leaks.

153
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:58,946
You got a big mouth.

154
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,414
And don't forget, Big Al,

155
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:02,687
I'm the one in power here.

156
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,390
- Maybe that's our problem.

157
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:06,195
- You push too far.

158
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,806
That's a call from New York.

159
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,009
Hello.

160
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,746
- Ciao, Lil Pete.

161
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,351
Ciao, boss, it's nice of you to call.

162
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:19,089
- Do you have your men with ya?

163
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,460
- Oh, yes, boss,
they're all here. Everybody's here.

164
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:22,630
Put me on conference.

165
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:23,465
- Si.

166
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:27,240
- You boys have embarrassed me.

167
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,911
Opportunities blown.

168
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,750
It's hard to believe.

169
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,523
You guys being defeated

170
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,896
by a bunch of kung fu clowns.

171
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,904
The next time you're on the job,

172
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:44,243
you think about your family.

173
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:47,150
One more mistake,

174
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,194
they'll be widows and orphans.

175
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:57,105
I'm going to make sashimi out of you.

176
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,024
This

177
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,495
is the last fish

178
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,334
that I'm going to eat.

179
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:29,007
The next meal

180
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,045
will be you.

181
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,117
Kapish?

182
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:35,754
- Yes, Boss, don't worry.

183
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,658
Grazie, ciao.

184
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,098
Ciao, Lil Pete. Goodbye, boys.

185
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:44,105
- We gotta do something.

186
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,541
Pretty soon, we're gonna have the feds

187
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,146
fightin' in our own back yard.

188
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:51,655
Oh my God, it's a raid!

189
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:52,590
- Don't shoot!

190
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:54,395
Hey, guys, it's me, Freddy!

191
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:18,880
- What the hell is he doin'?

192
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,150
- Makin' lunch.

193
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:22,689
- Hi, boss.

194
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm makin' spaghetti for you.

195
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,062
You know the difference between

196
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:27,900
Italian food and Chinese food?

197
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,035
- No, what?

198
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:31,040
- $5 per person.

199
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,178
- Ah Fung?

200
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,748
I went school with him.

201
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,285
His brother name Ah Chu.

202
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:38,390
- Ah Maron?

203
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,162
I don't know him.

204
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,041
- Help. Help!

205
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:05,548
- Hey!

206
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,557
Break up.

207
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:13,230
Lady, give that man his purse back.

208
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:15,903
- It's my purse, he's the thief.

209
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:17,740
- What you doin' around here, man?

210
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:20,815
And where you from and what you want?

211
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,493
- With my right foot,
I can knock out that knife.

212
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,133
With my left I can kick your nose.

213
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:33,542
With this hand, I can poke out your eyes.

214
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:37,416
With this, I can break your neck.

215
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:41,324
Take a good look at my face.

216
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,262
I'm an oriental.

217
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,337
- It's cool, bro.

218
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:50,344
I don't want to trouble this time,
it's cool.

219
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:53,250
But next time, it's gon' be me

220
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:54,887
and you.

221
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:58,864
- I don't wanna see
your face in this area again.

222
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:19,640
Arrivederci.

223
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:22,680
- How many time I got to tell you,

224
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,350
arrivederci, she means goodbye, huh?

225
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,585
- Sometimes

226
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,825
I don't know if I'm coming or going.

227
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,394
- What do you got in the box?

228
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,598
- Oh, some noodles for Genele.

229
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:34,539
Maria!

230
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,142
Maria.

231
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,479
For Genele, huh.

232
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,921
Say, you look a little pale,
how 'bout a beer, huh?

233
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:42,924
- Hey, baby.

234
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:47,100
Hey, check it out. Woo.

235
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,283
- Hi.

236
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:56,754
- Hello.

237
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,256
Oh, you look so beautiful.

238
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,659
Are you from New York.

239
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:02,801
- No, but I am drinking a Manhattan.

240
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,705
Is that close enough to New York for ya?

241
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:06,373
- No, I gotta go there.

242
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,714
You see, my grandfather had a dying wish.

243
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:10,249
- And, what was that?

244
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,120
- To stay alive.

245
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:15,060
He said I must go to New York,
find this woman.

246
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,197
My grandfather loved her.

247
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,304
She's gonna take care
of me if she's still there.

248
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,242
- My name's Anita, what's yours?

249
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:24,579
- They call me Bruce.

250
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,319
- You mean, like Bruce Lee.

251
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,655
- Yeah, who else?

252
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,592
- Then you must know kung fu.

253
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,498
- Oh yeah, I once stepped in it.

254
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,205
- Hey.

255
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:39,746
If you're lookin' for Mister Right,
I'm right here.

256
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:42,486
- How 'bout some Tequila, Sheila?

257
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:45,325
- To tell you the truth,

258
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,627
I'm glad that you're here to protect me.

259
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:48,631
Those guys scare me.

260
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,640
- I can take those guys out
with one bare hand.

261
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,947
Stick with me, I’ll teach you self defense.

262
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,217
- Okay.

263
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:58,620
- Hey, egg roll.

264
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,558
We heard what you said.

265
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:06,470
- With my right foot,
I can knock out your face.

266
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:09,410
With my left, I can kick your nose.

267
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:13,786
With this, I can poke your eyes out.

268
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:16,424
With this I can break your neck.

269
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:18,698
Take a good look at my face.

270
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:20,970
I'm an oriental.

271
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,376
- I challenge you, sucker.

272
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,921
- I gotta go to john.

273
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,024
Mexican beer.

274
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,029
I'll be back.

275
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,302
I'll be back, you guys.

276
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,275
Be prepared, you guys.

277
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,459
- Open the door, you creep.

278
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:50,000
- Rape, rape!

279
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:51,902
Leave me alone!

280
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,975
- Come on, buddy, let's go!

281
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,552
- I'm coming right out, you guys!

282
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,788
Be prepared, you guys.

283
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,511
Bruce.

284
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:31,419
If I was half as good as you,

285
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,292
I could've fought those guys in the bar.

286
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,565
And I would be with that girl.

287
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,571
Bruce, you are the best.

288
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:50,997
I gotta eat more Mongolian beef.

289
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:25,231
I'm gonna be just like you.

290
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,771
With hard training and proper diet,

291
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:30,209
I'm gonna be as fast as you are.

292
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,880
And strong as Rocky.

293
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:34,686
Rocky?

294
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,986
Yes.

295
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:52,024
Diet.

296
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:05,418
Egg foo Yung would be better.

297
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:22,654
- May I help you?

298
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:25,395
- Yes, I wanna be like Bruce Lee.

299
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:28,467
- We will start you with a white belt.

300
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:30,338
- Oh, that's good.

301
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:31,174
- Mikey?

302
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:35,383
Give him a gi and a white belt.

303
00:21:37,454 --> 00:21:40,493
Alright, everybody stretch.

304
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:41,330
Stretch.

305
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,236
Stretch to your right.

306
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,839
Stretch to your left.

307
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,674
Twist.

308
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:48,411
Stretch.

309
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:50,884
Come in.

310
00:21:56,997 --> 00:22:00,671
You must have the right spirit to guide you.

311
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:03,209
Inner peace.

312
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,813
Control.

313
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:05,648
Patience.

314
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,588
It's all mental.

315
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:11,059
- My grandfather was a mental patient.

316
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,498
My father was a mental patient.

317
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,168
And now it's my turn.

318
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,106
- Let me stress

319
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,876
inner peace.

320
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:20,514
Control.

321
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:21,851
And tranquility.

322
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:25,524
Excuse me.

323
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,975
Hello, Dojo Studio.

324
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:40,622
What the hell you talking
about you son of a bitch?

325
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:42,526
I'll sue you for every yen you have,

326
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:46,703
you stupid damn!

327
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:51,113
As I was saying.

328
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:53,185
You have to have control.

329
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
With control comes concentration.

330
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,831
You see the wall?

331
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:02,270
You can make a hole through the wall if

332
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:04,775
you have concentration.

333
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:07,414
Try it, you can do it.

334
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:08,984
- I'm not gonna try it.

335
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:10,287
You try it.

336
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,593
- I'm not gonna try it, I'm the master.

337
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:16,769
- Let's get Mikey, he'll try anything.

338
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,581
Class, do you think he can do it?

339
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:27,358
You see?

340
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,626
They don't think you can do it.

341
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:30,196
And I don't think you can do it, either.

342
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:31,935
You asked for it.

343
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:35,708
What's going on?

344
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,178
What is this?

345
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:39,216
- Well, hi Master,
you're a little early today.

346
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,320
Oh God, come on, what is it?

347
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:45,097
- Mikey, Mikey, come here for a second.

348
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:47,768
Hey, what's going on in here?

349
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:50,140
What is this, get out of here,
I'm gonna call the cops.

350
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:52,779
- It's all in the kya.

351
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,253
When you kya,
you must bring all energy from your body

352
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:58,158
into one focused point.

353
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:00,329
Kya!

354
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:03,269
Now, you try it.

355
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:06,008
Hmm.

356
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,155
- Kya!

357
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,629
- You?

358
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,200
- No, Memorex.

359
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:19,871
- Get out of my place.

360
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,107
You are hopeless.

361
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,078
- I must learn to be mental.

362
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,514
- You are mental.

363
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,854
- But I'm paying you to teach me.

364
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:29,724
- I'll refund your money.

365
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:32,399
Change your clothes and get out!

366
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:46,728
- Whoa, you're very good.

367
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:47,764
Let me see.

368
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:49,033
It's natural for me.

369
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,804
I do that all the time
when I make a noodle.

370
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,641
See, oh, look at this.

371
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:54,244
Oh, Master.

372
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,250
Oh, I know how to do this. - No, no!

373
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:03,231
- My vase, you broke it!

374
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,341
I will kill you.

375
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,645
- Master, you're out of control.

376
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:14,389
You sucker mother!

377
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,505
Now what?

378
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:24,209
- I wanna return your sticks.

379
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,611
- Keep them.

380
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:28,619
Go home and practice in your closet.

381
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,483
- Are these eggs fresh?

382
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:16,956
- Hey, this is a stick up, man!

383
00:26:16,957 --> 00:26:18,191
Hands up.

384
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:19,327
You, hurry up with the money. Come on.

385
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,600
And don't do nothin' stupid, huh.

386
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,822
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

387
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,292
It's not him.

388
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:52,399
He's not the robber. He's the robber!

389
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,310
You should've seen this guy's
fantastic kung fu technique!

390
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,114
Unbelievable.

391
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:00,717
Like, he's so fast!

392
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,957
And powerful.

393
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:08,134
I'm tellin' ya,
this guy is Bruce Lee reincarnated.

394
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:12,375
- You even look like Bruce Lee.

395
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:14,680
- Well, with the proper training and diet.

396
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:16,417
- Can you strike that
karate pose for the cameras

397
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:18,755
with the sticks over your head, please.

398
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:20,494
Get that, Sherry.

399
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,536
- A Bruce Lee lookalike

400
00:27:25,537 --> 00:27:29,078
put on a dazzling show of kung fu.

401
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,853
An eyewitness said that the
gunman never had a chance

402
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:35,358
against the martial arts hero.

403
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,068
- Ciao boss.

404
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:41,137
I got the good news.

405
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,374
No, I got the great news.

406
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,817
You don't have to
worry about any more trouble.

407
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:50,690
I got a guy who's gonna
fix everything from now on.

408
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:53,363
I got a new delivery man.

409
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:56,604
They call him Bruce, master of kung fu.

410
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:08,463
- Here comes the guy in the paper.

411
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:10,067
This ain't like the real Bruce Lee.

412
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,104
- Hey, man,
I don't care what the papers say.

413
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:13,875
You're still Brucey.

414
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:15,544
What are you lookin' at, Brucey.

415
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:16,814
You're nothin' but jive, man.

416
00:28:16,815 --> 00:28:18,517
I can kick your ass any day of the week.

417
00:28:18,518 --> 00:28:20,990
- Kick my ass any day.

418
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,393
Well, I'm busy all week.

419
00:28:22,394 --> 00:28:23,428
- Yeah, you're a phony, man.

420
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:24,864
You don't even know kung fu.

421
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:25,701
Get back.

422
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:34,252
What do you say to this, fool?

423
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:37,928
- If you must fight, fight dirty.

424
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:40,532
Kick him in the groin.

425
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,201
Hit him with a rock.

426
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:43,706
Bite off his nose.

427
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:48,750
But, most of all, use your brain.

428
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:51,522
Not fists.

429
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,134
- Oh, you're fantastic.

430
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,470
Who taught you that?

431
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,605
- Master Cho.

432
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:01,509
- Oh, we're acquaintances.

433
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,447
I study under Master Cho too.

434
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:06,053
Do you know the martial art code?

435
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:10,529
It says pupil study under
same master must never fight.

436
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,464
- Yeah?

437
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:12,433
For real, huh?

438
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,269
- Yeah.

439
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:17,177
And that's too bad, I can't beat you up.

440
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:18,246
What code?

441
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:19,281
- Well, maybe he's right.

442
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:20,518
Let's forget about it.

443
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,257
- Yeah, I don't study for Master Cho.

444
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:25,061
I study for Master Tung.

445
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:26,631
- Oh, that's great.

446
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,802
Then you two can fight.

447
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:31,041
And I personally think that Master Cho

448
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,612
is 10 times better than Master Tung.

449
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,917
- My master's better than Master Cho.

450
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:37,889
- Hey, wait a minute,
my master's better then yours.

451
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,397
What are you talkin' about,
Master Tung is a pussy.

452
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,069
- Yeah, yeah!

453
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,974
Hit him in the stomach.

454
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,012
Hit him in the balls.

455
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:50,684
Hit him in the nose.

456
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,063
- Hey, look.

457
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,334
He's got nun chucks in his pocket.

458
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:01,406
- Let's go check him out.

459
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:06,383
- Hey.

460
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:10,191
You got a permit to carry those nun chucks?

461
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,028
- This?

462
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:14,869
You don't need no permit for this.

463
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,008
- That's a lethal weapon,
you're under arrest.

464
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:19,612
- Wait a minute, wait, wait a minute.

465
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:24,322
These are my chopsticks.

466
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,871
I'm just a big eater.

467
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:44,700
Chopstick lickin' good.

468
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:03,240
- I sure hope this is gonna work, boss.

469
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,742
You hope.

470
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,145
It better work of the Boss of Bosses

471
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:08,717
is gonna make sashimi out of us.

472
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:10,187
- Hey, you can count on me, boss.

473
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:12,360
I'm not gonna let ya down.

474
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,432
- Yeah, remember, Freddy.

475
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,169
You're the only one I can trust.

476
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,475
I cannot trust Big Al anymore.

477
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:21,913
Yeah, well,
there have been rumors goin' around.

478
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:23,382
- What?

479
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,952
That Big Al thinks he's gonna
be boss of the West Coast?

480
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:27,758
That sneaky bastard
will never get my job. Never!

481
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,228
- Listen, boss, nobody can tear down

482
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:31,935
a reputation like yours.

483
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:34,272
You're a good boy, Freddy.

484
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:38,481
You've always been a loyal,
trusted servant of la familia.

485
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,254
When you get back from this job,
I'm gonna promote you.

486
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:43,994
You're gonna be my consigliere.

487
00:31:43,995 --> 00:31:45,296
- Really?

488
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:46,868
Like Robert Duvall?

489
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:50,007
- You gonna sit in Big Al's seat

490
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,844
at the other end of the table.

491
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:53,882
- I hope I don't have to sit on his lap.

492
00:31:53,883 --> 00:31:55,418
- Sit on his lap?

493
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,555
You make a joke?- Yeah.

494
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,662
People say I got no sense of humor.

495
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,600
Sit on his lap.

496
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,004
You make me laugh!

497
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,925
Hurry up,
I don't wanna miss Hollywood Squares.

498
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:15,428
- Oh boy, Florence Henderson.

499
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:17,332
- Florence Henderson.

500
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:21,140
Remember, no tell Bruce about anything.

501
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:22,477
Alright?- Yeah.

502
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,251
Make sure this place is locked up,

503
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:28,756
because this stuff is worth
millions of dollars now.

504
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:29,625
Yes, sir.

505
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:31,062
- That's it, huh?

506
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:59,390
- Put the barbells down,
I gotta talk to you.

507
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:02,029
- Look at you.

508
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,366
You've been eating too much pasta.

509
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:08,609
Take that tie off and get down
here and work out with me.

510
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,779
- Carmen, put those goddamn things down.

511
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,152
I got the plan set up.

512
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:16,259
- I hope this plan is
better than the last one.

513
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,563
If you wanna be boss in the West Coast,

514
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:21,437
killing Pete's dog isn't gonna do it.

515
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:23,541
- You know that poison
was meant for Little Pete.

516
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:27,551
How was I supposed to
know the dog likes cigars.

517
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:33,796
- So, what's your plan this time, Rover.

518
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:38,174
- You know I love you
just before you get slapped.

519
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:45,254
Had enough?

520
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,058
You really know how to hurt a guy.

521
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,396
Thanks, darling.

522
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:52,670
- Bad news from Africa.

523
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:55,644
Your brothers and sisters
are being killed for their ivory.

524
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:57,080
- Shut up and listen to me.

525
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:58,282
If I'm boss on this coast,

526
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:59,719
you'll be right there alongside me.

527
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,460
You'd like that power, wouldn't you?

528
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:04,730
Why'd you have to kick me?

529
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:06,066
You didn't have to kick me.

530
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:08,339
- Oh, I'm sorry, poor baby.

531
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:11,044
- Look, the Boss of Bosses

532
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,512
is going to exterminate Little Pete

533
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:14,251
if one more job gets busted.

534
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,221
I know Little Pete's plan.

535
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,625
They're settin' up
Bruce as a delivery stooge.

536
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,762
You follow Bruce,

537
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:21,332
switch the coke whenever you can

538
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,103
before they get to New York, okay?

539
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,408
Little Pete will be river moss,

540
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,015
and I'll be boss of the West Coast.

541
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:35,496
- You mean we will
be boss on the West Coast.

542
00:34:35,497 --> 00:34:37,234
- That's what I said.

543
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,154
- Bruce.

544
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:52,633
You're a hero, I saw you in the papers.

545
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,470
You're very brave.

546
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,840
Where'd you get your black belt.

547
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:58,279
- Oh, I got my black belt in the Orient.

548
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,984
It was easy. Only written test.

549
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:02,721
- Do you have a girlfriend?

550
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:04,625
- I'm a sex object.

551
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:07,500
Every time I ask girls sex, they object.

552
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,041
- Well, could I be your girlfriend?

553
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:15,716
Listen, I'll give you this necklace.

554
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:16,552
Here.

555
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:19,692
Let's go steady.

556
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:20,527
Okay?

557
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:28,744
Now, as long as you wear this,

558
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:31,116
I'm not gonna make love to another man.

559
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:32,420
- Me neither.

560
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,469
Bruce, I got a new job for you.

561
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,804
A new job?

562
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,676
- I'm givin' you a raise.

563
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:45,713
From now on, you get the minimum wage.

564
00:35:45,714 --> 00:35:48,019
- What do I gotta do, boss.

565
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,091
- Listen and I tell you.

566
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:52,762
Your spaghetti recipe, it's famous.

567
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:54,732
I told all of my friends all
around the country

568
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:56,804
about your Chinese noodles.

569
00:35:56,805 --> 00:36:00,479
And they're very anxious
to get this special flour.

570
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,652
So, I'm a send you to New York.

571
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:04,589
- New York?

572
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:07,093
More money and going to New York?

573
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:09,599
- You got to learn about America.

574
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,770
This is one great country.

575
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,109
- When do I start?

576
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,177
- What, you got ants in your pants?

577
00:36:15,178 --> 00:36:16,348
When I say so.

578
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:19,321
- How long does it take to fly to New York?

579
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:21,591
- Wait a minute, not so fast.

580
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:24,764
First, you gotta stop at different cities.

581
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:28,640
If you don't deliver the
flour to all of my friends,

582
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:31,480
you never get to New York. Understand?

583
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,452
- I finally get to go to New York.

584
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,156
- Freddy, he's gonna chauffeur you.

585
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:37,425
- Freddy?

586
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:38,428
My chauffeur?

587
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,267
Why don't we want to fly?

588
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,435
- Fly?

589
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:44,207
When you fly, you see nothing.

590
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,542
But when you drive,

591
00:36:45,543 --> 00:36:48,415
you get to know this beautiful country.

592
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,586
Start packing.

593
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,689
Bruce, where you get that necklace?

594
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,393
I never seen that on you before.

595
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:54,661
- Oh, this?

596
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,733
It was a gift from my new girlfriend.

597
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:57,970
- Ah.

598
00:36:57,971 --> 00:36:58,906
When you get back from your trip,

599
00:36:58,907 --> 00:37:00,708
maybe you get married, eh?

600
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:01,979
- Oh, I love get married.

601
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,815
But I hate to give up my girlfriend.

602
00:37:03,816 --> 00:37:05,519
- Bruce, tell us about your girl.

603
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,524
- Oh, she's beautiful.

604
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,927
Sexy legs.

605
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,830
Really big eyes.

606
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:12,100
- Yeah, yeah?

607
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:13,138
Did you touch any?

608
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:17,411
- Easy, animal.

609
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:19,283
She hugged me.- Yeah?

610
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:22,456
And she was moaning. - Yeah, yeah?

611
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,927
She tore my shirt off.

612
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:26,798
And scratched my back. - Yeah?

613
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,502
Kissing my eye.

614
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,573
Kissing my nose.- Yeah!

615
00:37:30,574 --> 00:37:31,742
Breathing in my ear.

616
00:37:31,743 --> 00:37:34,348
So, was she good?

617
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:36,185
I'm not sure.

618
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:38,024
I don't kiss and tell.

619
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:40,929
- This is serious.

620
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,632
Now, Bruce could lead us
to the head of this drug ring,

621
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:43,903
and you guys know it.

622
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:45,405
Now, we've got to do whatever it takes

623
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:47,776
to get him to New York.

624
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:49,616
- Breathing in my ear?

625
00:37:56,496 --> 00:37:57,765
- Bruce.

626
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,470
Be sure to deliver all of the flour

627
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:02,142
and never let it out of your sight.

628
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:05,314
Otherwise, you never get to New York.

629
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:06,250
Freddy, he's gonna keep an eye on you.

630
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,787
Right, Freddy?

631
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,490
- There's right,
we're not gonna let you down, boss.

632
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:11,127
- Oh, I wanna capture this moment.

633
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:12,797
Say kim cheese.

634
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:14,971
- No, no, no. No pictures.

635
00:38:16,406 --> 00:38:20,114
Just remember to never let
the flour out of your sight. Eh?

636
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:23,487
Alright, your first step is Las Vegas,
so enjoy yourself.

637
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,460
But, don't gamble unless
Freddy shows you how to do it, huh?

638
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,231
- I never gambled before.

639
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:30,135
I can't even say blackjack.

640
00:38:30,136 --> 00:38:32,040
Goodbye, so long.

641
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,143
- Ciao, ciao.

642
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,052
Freddy, remember,
drive carefully on the road.

643
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:40,557
We can't afford accidents or tickets, huh?

644
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:41,393
Good boy.

645
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:19,041
Ya-Ha, Leos Vegas!

646
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,445
The town where everybody's a winner!

647
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,783
Boy, look at these places.

648
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:25,855
Where's the Mustang Ranch?

649
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:28,394
My grandfather once had a sweet there.

650
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:36,778
- Sy, Hy, listen up.

651
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:41,888
Boss of Bosses thinks he
can deliver powder in my town

652
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:43,962
without kickin' in, he's crazy.

653
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:47,768
I want you should get
Lil Pete's deliveryman

654
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:49,573
and kill him if you have to.

655
00:39:49,574 --> 00:39:52,379
But bring that powder to me.

656
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,486
Here, these are the guys that you kill.

657
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,888
Intercept their cocaine

658
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:59,827
before it gets to the Las Vegas connection.

659
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:02,568
Waste him before they leave town.

660
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,408
- Be a pleasure, boss.

661
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:09,951
- Oh, and would you remind
me to call my mother on Tuesday.

662
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,701
- Hi.

663
00:40:18,702 --> 00:40:19,539
Hi.

664
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:22,578
- Ah, thanks.

665
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:27,154
We heard a lot about you, Bruce.

666
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:30,962
The martial arts and your
special flour here.

667
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,498
- You want me to cook for you?

668
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:36,239

685
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:14,256

I'll give him a discount.

752

00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:03,861
- I believe the Chinese boy
offerin' us a bribe.

838
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:04,763
- Kinda looks like it.

839
00:50:04,764 --> 00:50:05,833
- No, no, no.

840
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,308
Get out of the car.

841
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,946
Get out of the car now.

842
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:14,585
- You can't bribe us.

843
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:16,824
- At least not for nickles.

844
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,105
- Could you help me?

845
00:50:24,106 --> 00:50:27,848
I think I've got a
slow leak in my rear tire.

846
00:50:30,888 --> 00:50:33,760
- I'll be more than glad to help you out,
ma'am.

847
00:50:33,761 --> 00:50:35,764
- Did you say you think
you got a slow leak, ma'am?

848
00:50:35,765 --> 00:50:38,504
- Well, I don't know anything about cars.

849
00:50:38,505 --> 00:50:42,244
But I do know about
practically everything else.

850
00:50:42,245 --> 00:50:44,116
- I bet you do.

851
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:45,786
- Get the hell in the car.

852
00:50:45,787 --> 00:50:46,621
- I'm hip.

853
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:47,455
- Get in the car.

854
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:49,061
- Hip, hip.

855
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:57,912
- Give them some chloroform and
put them in the patrol car.

856
00:50:57,913 --> 00:51:00,084
That should buy some time.

857
00:51:26,408 --> 00:51:30,483
Freddy,
that Toyota didn't even stop for me.

858
00:51:30,484 --> 00:51:33,155
I was once run over by a Toyota.

859
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,758
Oh, what a feeling.

860
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:37,464
Look, we can't waste much time, you know.

861
00:51:37,465 --> 00:51:39,635
The cops'll be on our neck any minute now.

862
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:41,640
That's got it.

863
00:51:43,712 --> 00:51:44,646
Oh, Jesus.

864
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:45,381
It's an attack.

865
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:46,550
Attack!

866
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:48,087
Attack!

867
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:52,363
- Hey!

868
00:51:52,364 --> 00:51:53,198
Hey!

869
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,885
- Kung fu cowboy?

870
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,121
- Looks like you got yourself

871
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,423
in a heap of trouble there, partner.

872
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:07,195
Or, did you just marry a cop?

873
00:52:07,196 --> 00:52:08,464
- Excuse me.

874
00:52:08,465 --> 00:52:09,733
Do you happen to know a blacksmith

875
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:11,837
or somebody around who can get this

876
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,441
bracelet off my friend.

877
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:14,811
- I'll do better than that for ya.

878
00:52:14,812 --> 00:52:16,448
Hold your arm out straight there.

879
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:21,994
- Wow.

880
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,070
See ya.- Happy trails.

881
00:52:39,598 --> 00:52:40,799
- Well, Bruce.

882
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,004
That takes care of the Houston delivery.

883
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:46,847
- Another job is over now,
it's a Miller time.

884
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:57,203
Bonzai, huh?

885
00:52:57,204 --> 00:52:58,038
Hey.

886
00:53:12,837 --> 00:53:14,005
- What's your pleasure?

887
00:53:14,006 --> 00:53:16,777
Cowboy?

888
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:18,682
- Sake light.

889
00:53:18,683 --> 00:53:21,154
- Well, we don't got no sake light.

890
00:53:21,155 --> 00:53:24,528
All we got is sake natural.

891
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:27,668
- I come all the way from California,

892
00:53:27,669 --> 00:53:31,277
and the only thing you got is sake natural?

893
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:46,041
It ain't bad.

894
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:47,178
I'm surprised.

895
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:58,202
- I'm a two-fisted drinker.

896
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:03,212
I like to drink and punch people out.

897
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:05,449
- Oh, I like to drink and each sushi.

898
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,284
- Susie?

899
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,521
Susie's my girl.

900
00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:09,158
- Oh, you like sushi like I like sushi?

901
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:10,960
- Yeah, I like Susie.

902
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:13,600
- I had sushi last night.

903
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:16,105
You should eat sushi in the morning,
sushi in the evening,

904
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:18,008
sushi for suppertime.

905
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:20,316
Then you wouldn't be so fat.

906
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:26,026
- What the hell's wrong with you, China boy?

907
00:54:26,027 --> 00:54:27,464
What's your name?

908
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:31,004
Wong or Dong?

909
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:32,875
- They call me Bruce.

910
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:33,910
- Bruce?

911
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:34,746
No, Bruce.

912
00:54:37,853 --> 00:54:40,324
- Well, I tell you what, Bruce?

913
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:43,766
I'm gonna put bruises all over your body.

914
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:50,580
- If you can snatch
this pebble from my hand,

915
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:53,286
then you are ready.

916
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,595
- Grandfather,
there is big bird over your head.

917
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:03,909
- I'm not gonna fall for that old trick.

918
00:56:54,482 --> 00:56:58,656
Ooh, punchin' doggies.

919
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,984
- Let's get out of here.

920
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,237
- Holy turd.

921
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,175
- Anybody drunk?

922
00:57:23,176 --> 00:57:24,779
I wanna arrest somebody.

923
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,850
- Hey, guys,
let's wait til they throw up here.

924
00:57:26,851 --> 00:57:29,289
I hate to clean up the jail.

925
00:57:32,096 --> 00:57:35,534
- Well, don't just stand there,
arrest somebody.

926
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,275
- You guys, shut the hell up.

927
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:39,543
- He ain't with us.

928
00:57:39,544 --> 00:57:40,980
- I thought he was.

929
00:57:40,981 --> 00:57:42,184
If Stephen hadn't been
tryin' to steal the furniture,

930
00:57:42,185 --> 00:57:44,354
we wouldn't be in here.

931
00:57:44,355 --> 00:57:45,957
- What are you lookin' at?

932
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:48,163
Haven't you seen a guy in a jail before?

933
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,967
You're lucky, these iron bars in the way.

934
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:54,476
I'll finish you punks off another time.

935
00:57:54,477 --> 00:57:56,480
- When I get out of here,

936
00:57:56,481 --> 00:58:00,020
I'm gonna squash your face. Truth.

937
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:02,227
- Hey, this food sucks.

938
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,964
- How 'bout some mashed taters?

939
00:58:04,965 --> 00:58:08,139
- Gee wiz, I've got a riot on my hands.

940
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,410
What am I supposed to do about it?

941
00:58:10,411 --> 00:58:12,482
- Serve real food, fat face.

942
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:15,321
- Now listen, Stephen,
I don't have to take that from you.

943
00:58:15,322 --> 00:58:16,523
- Oh, I got an idea.

944
00:58:16,524 --> 00:58:18,862
Why don't I make my famous Chinese noodles?

945
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,133
- Oh, my favorite dish is moo goo gai.

946
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:23,506
- Your favorite dish is some young guy.

947
00:58:24,976 --> 00:58:27,346
- I have a very special
flour right here in my bag.

948
00:58:27,347 --> 00:58:28,749
- Gee, I don't know.

949
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,621
The guard sucks. The guard sucks.

950
00:58:30,622 --> 00:58:32,391
The guard sucks. The guard sucks.

951
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:34,562
The guard sucks. The guard sucks.

952
00:58:34,563 --> 00:58:36,901
The guard sucks. The guard sucks.

953
00:58:36,902 --> 00:58:40,208
The guard sucks. The guard sucks.

954
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:42,513
The guard sucks.- Stop it!

955
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:45,619
- I'll let him go in and
cook in the jail's kitchen.

956
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,190
- Alright, alright.

957
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:51,565
- You got microwave wok?

958
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:53,035
- I don't think this is a good idea.

959
00:58:53,036 --> 00:58:55,107
- Pretty face, stay out of this.

960
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:56,509
- Look, you don't understand.

961
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,115
This is very expensive flour.

962
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:01,720
We can't afford to waste
it on a bunch of prisoners.

963
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:02,822
- Don't be selfish.

964
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:05,329
Guard, take me to the kitchen.

965
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,234
Let go!

966
00:59:09,638 --> 00:59:11,441
- Look what you did!

967
00:59:11,442 --> 00:59:14,183
The boss is gonna kill me!

968
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:22,265
- The more I inhale,
I wanna be an astronaut.

969
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:23,934
- Well, the more I inhale

970
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,543
the more sick and tired l get of your face.

971
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:29,213
All of your faces.

972
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:30,718
Everybody go home.

973
00:59:39,102 --> 00:59:42,176
Let's go catch us some real criminals.

974
00:59:43,946 --> 00:59:45,982
- Now you're talking, yeah!

975
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,653
- Will you excuse me for a moment?

976
00:59:47,654 --> 00:59:48,557
- Go ahead.

977
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:55,704
- Man you have enough on
that arm for a condominium.

978
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:57,174
In Florida.

979
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,009
- Hang on.

980
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:01,717
You still got that M&M?- Yeah.

981
01:00:01,718 --> 01:00:03,989
Let's peel 'em and eat him.

982
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,028
And then we'll drive to Europe.

983

Two of Lil Pete's guys
are comin' into town.

1002
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:25,597
I wanna get those guys.

1003
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,202
I want them killed.

1004
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,673
How ya gonna do it?

1005
01:01:31,744 --> 01:01:33,347
- Well,

1006
01:01:33,348 --> 01:01:34,184
we could,

1007
01:01:35,419 --> 01:01:38,826
we could slit his throat from ear to ear.

1008
01:01:41,332 --> 01:01:43,669
Or, perhaps you're looking for something

1009
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,741
a little bit less bloody.

1010
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:51,019
I could throw a flying
star between his eyes.

1011
01:01:55,563 --> 01:01:57,132
Ooh!

1012
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:59,571
Or, we could just drown them.

1013
01:02:02,144 --> 01:02:03,513
Slam dunk!

1014
01:02:05,551 --> 01:02:06,387
- Yeah!

1015
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:11,262
- Of course,

1016
01:02:11,263 --> 01:02:15,237
maybe you're into a little torture first.

1017
01:02:15,238 --> 01:02:19,414
For that, we have a whole
new line of this year's gag balls.

1018
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:22,186
Gag balls.

1019
01:02:22,187 --> 01:02:24,358
And we have leather whips.

1020
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:30,138
I love the whips part.

1021
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,276
The name's Toby!

1022
01:02:33,277 --> 01:02:34,312
The name's Toby!

1023
01:02:34,313 --> 01:02:36,784
No, no, Kunta Kinte,

1024
01:02:36,785 --> 01:02:37,920
Your name's Toby!

1025
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,256
That's for Suzy Chapstick.

1026
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,026
And that's for meat by-products.

1027
01:02:41,027 --> 01:02:43,732
And that's for Lucciano Pavorati.

1028
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:45,236
And that's for people that stop on

1029
01:02:45,237 --> 01:02:47,240
entrance ramps of freeways.

1030
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:48,143
The name's Toby.

1031
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:49,846
No, no, Kunta Kinte.

1032
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:52,284
That's for the Village People.

1033
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:54,256
That's for nondairy creamers.

1034
01:02:54,257 --> 01:02:56,093
And that's for heehaw!

1035
01:02:57,997 --> 01:02:59,399
You're name's Toby.

1036
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,206
Yes, yes, my name is Toby.

1037
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:05,044
Help me!

1038
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:12,196
Of course there's always castration.

1039
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:18,609
Of course,
if you want some more conventional method.

1040
01:03:19,811 --> 01:03:22,750
This gun and silencer is just dandy.

1041
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:43,928
- I hope everything is
prepared for the arrival of my guest.

1042
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:46,433
Look, I want you to make him feel at home.

1043
01:03:46,434 --> 01:03:48,940
He's a very important visitor.

1044
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:50,878
Go all out.

1045
01:03:54,552 --> 01:03:56,522
Well, Bruce, we're in Chicago.

1046
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:59,561
One more delivery,
and we're on our way to New York.

1047
01:03:59,562 --> 01:04:03,003
My grandfather told me
he had a friend in Chicago.

1048
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:04,372
Al Capone.

1049
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,746
Never heard of him.

1050
01:04:07,747 --> 01:04:10,118
- Bruce has arrived, sir.

1051
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:11,957
- Tell him to come in.

1052
01:04:17,635 --> 01:04:18,904
- Howdy, folks.

1053
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:21,376
- Welcome.

1054
01:04:21,377 --> 01:04:22,646
- What is this?

1055
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:25,918
- Give me a hug!

1056
01:04:25,919 --> 01:04:28,424
- Oh, sure. Welcome.

1057
01:04:28,425 --> 01:04:29,260
Oh, of course.

1058
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:30,830
Welcome.

1059
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,941
- That's for jello pudding.

1060
01:05:06,942 --> 01:05:08,444
That's for bagpipes.

1061
01:05:08,445 --> 01:05:11,283
That's for pina coladas.

1062
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:13,289
That's for kitty litter.

1063
01:05:18,801 --> 01:05:20,070
- I love sushi.

1064
01:05:21,072 --> 01:05:21,874
Seaweed.

1065
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:23,710
Octopus.

1066
01:05:26,149 --> 01:05:28,254
But who ordered that fly?

1067
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:42,984
I as a samurai warrior, but I gave it up.

1068
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,123
You were a samurai warrior?

1069
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:46,492
Why did you quit?

1070
01:05:46,493 --> 01:05:47,329
- Union problems.

1071
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:54,844
- You say you're a samurai warrior,

1072
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:57,082
but the fly is still alive.

1073
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:00,424
- But that fly will never make love again.

1074
01:06:02,462 --> 01:06:04,865
- After dinner, I'll give you a massage.

1075
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:06,101
Would you like that?

1076
01:06:06,102 --> 01:06:06,970
- Massage?

1077
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:08,907
I like massage.

1078
01:06:08,908 --> 01:06:11,044
In fact, my first time in America,

1079
01:06:11,045 --> 01:06:13,350
I worked at massage parlor.

1080
01:06:13,351 --> 01:06:14,352
They fired me.

1081
01:06:14,353 --> 01:06:15,354
- What for?

1082
01:06:15,355 --> 01:06:18,396
- Rubbing people the wrong way.

1083
01:06:54,174 --> 01:06:55,676
- Ah, that's good.

1084
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,415
Harder.

1085
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:00,653
Harder.

1086
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:02,591
Ah.

1087
01:07:04,026 --> 01:07:04,861
Ah.

1088
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:14,080
Oriental women walk
five feet behind the men.

1089
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:16,687
American men walk all over men.

1090
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:22,365
You think you're going to
give me acupuncture.

1091
01:07:22,366 --> 01:07:24,103
Now I really need it.

1092
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,091
Ooh, ooh.

1093
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:36,664
Whoa, whoa.

1094
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:37,632
What are you doing?

1095
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:39,235
- I'm playing doctor.

1096
01:07:39,236 --> 01:07:41,339
- Doctor, I'm fine down there.

1097
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,678
Pain it up here.

1098
01:08:10,737 --> 01:08:11,571
- Hello.

1099
01:08:11,572 --> 01:08:12,674
- Big Al?

1100
01:08:12,675 --> 01:08:13,709
It's me.

1101
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,045
- Carmen, baby.

1102
01:08:15,046 --> 01:08:16,915
You didn't screw up again, did ya?

1103
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,153
- I got the bag.

1104
01:08:18,154 --> 01:08:19,389
I switched them.

1105
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:23,330
They have the real
flour and we have the stuff.

1106
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:25,735
- Oh, you're beautiful, baby.

1107
01:08:25,736 --> 01:08:28,976
And Little Pete, he's gonna get the ax.

1108
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:32,750
- You're not gonna forget
about me and our plans, are you?

1109
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:34,388
- Oh, of course not, kiddo.

1110
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:36,459
I want you to come back here right away.

1111
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,961
And be careful.

1112
01:08:37,962 --> 01:08:41,336
You're carrying enough
powder to get all of Chicago high.

1113
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,209
- I'm so excited, Al.

1114
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:46,179
Finally, our dreams are gonna come true.

1115
01:09:18,484 --> 01:09:20,921
- What is he doing, boss?

1116
01:09:20,922 --> 01:09:23,627
- Just checking your Chinese flour.

1117
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:27,135
- You don't need him, I'm the real expert.

1118
01:09:30,142 --> 01:09:31,478
- This is flour.

1119
01:09:33,482 --> 01:09:34,384
- Yes, sir.

1120
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:38,793
My test shows this is genuine flour.

1121
01:09:40,331 --> 01:09:43,002
And a very good grade I may add.

1122
01:09:46,142 --> 01:09:49,816
- I'm not paying you to be a joker.

1123
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:52,590
Now, if your life depended on it.

1124
01:09:54,628 --> 01:09:55,630
And it does.

1125
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,208
Do you swear that this stuff is flour.

1126
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:02,879
- Sir, I'm positive.

1127
01:10:05,852 --> 01:10:08,692
- I want you out of this room now.

1128
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:10,962
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:16,374
- Freddy.

1130
01:10:17,443 --> 01:10:18,680
Freddy, Freddy.

1131
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:20,884
Ah, Freddy.

1132
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:27,265
You know what this means,
don't you, Freddy?

1133
01:10:36,285 --> 01:10:37,787
- Goodbye, Freddy.

1134
01:10:38,856 --> 01:10:40,058
- I know what that means.

1135
01:10:40,059 --> 01:10:42,096
That means kiss of death.

1136
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:43,899
I've seen Godfather movie.

1137
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,372
But, I hate to tell you this, Boss.

1138
01:10:46,373 --> 01:10:49,279
You don't kiss as good as Marlon Brando.

1139
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,383
Now you gonna kiss me too?

1140
01:10:51,384 --> 01:10:53,822
- You shall die by my bullet,

1141
01:10:54,991 --> 01:10:58,732
because that's as much as I can do for you.

1142
01:11:14,132 --> 01:11:15,334
- Freddy, come on.

1143
01:11:15,335 --> 01:11:16,169
- Get him!

1144
01:11:35,143 --> 01:11:36,079
- Go, go, go, go.

1145
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,548
Go now, go now, go, go, go, go.

1146
01:11:37,549 --> 01:11:39,152
Don't wait, go, go.

1147
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:29,828
- Lady, please help me.

1148
01:12:29,829 --> 01:12:32,233
There are gangsters after me.

1149
01:12:32,234 --> 01:12:33,167
- Gangsters?

1150
01:12:33,168 --> 01:12:34,203
What happened?

1151
01:12:34,204 --> 01:12:35,641
- I can't explain.

1152
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,979
Would you hide me some place?

1153
01:12:52,645 --> 01:12:54,949
- We're lookin' for an Oriental,
you seen him?

1154
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:59,157
If you are referring to a particular person

1155
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:02,030
of the Asian Mongolian race,

1156
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:06,340
they are not indigenous to this propinquity.

1157
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:08,644
- What the hell is she talking about?

1158
01:13:08,645 --> 01:13:12,787
- She said there's no rice
peddlers in this neighborhood.

1159
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,357
- Yeah?

1160
01:13:14,358 --> 01:13:16,461
You don't mind if we look around?

1161
01:13:16,462 --> 01:13:19,067
- Do you have a search warrant?

1162
01:13:19,068 --> 01:13:21,071
I know my rights.

1163
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:24,446
I happen to be a law student at NYU.

1164
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:25,516
- Yeah, lady.

1165
01:13:26,451 --> 01:13:28,822
This is our search warrant.

1166
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:41,282
- Stop it!

1167
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:44,020
Stop it, you’re ruining my merchandise.

1168
01:13:44,021 --> 01:13:47,194
- You'll get reimbursed in Hell, lady.

1169
01:13:53,643 --> 01:13:54,744
- Stop it!

1170
01:13:54,745 --> 01:13:55,946
Stop it!

1171
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:58,286
- You got somethin' to hide?

1172
01:14:06,003 --> 01:14:06,970
I'll tell you!

1173
01:14:06,971 --> 01:14:08,641
I'll tell you where he is!

1174
01:14:08,642 --> 01:14:10,377
Well, why didn't you say so?

1175
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:12,516
- He's in the back room.

1176
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:13,985
- Excuse me.

1177
01:14:13,986 --> 01:14:14,988
- It's okay.

1178
01:14:45,788 --> 01:14:47,992
- What are ya searchin' for?

1179
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:49,729
What are ya searchin' for?

1180
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,400
I want you to tell me today. - Amen!

1181
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:54,273
What are you searching for?

1182
01:14:54,274 --> 01:14:55,942
Come, look at me.

1183
01:14:55,943 --> 01:14:56,877
Tell me.

1184
01:14:56,878 --> 01:14:58,681
- I am searchin' for him.

1185
01:14:58,682 --> 01:14:59,984
Amen!

1186
01:14:59,985 --> 01:15:02,490
- Ask and it will be given you.

1187
01:15:02,491 --> 01:15:04,861
Seek and you will find.

1188
01:15:04,862 --> 01:15:08,201
Knock and it will be open to you.

1189
01:15:08,202 --> 01:15:09,104
Yeah, Amen.

1190
01:15:11,344 --> 01:15:13,848
What are you searching for?

1191
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:16,085
- I want to be healed.

1192
01:15:16,086 --> 01:15:19,026
- You're in the wrong line, sister.

1193
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:23,435
Remember, children.

1194
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,206
God gave us his love.

1195
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:30,284
And the Catholics gave us bingo,
hallelujah!

1196
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:32,321
Hallelujah!

1197
01:15:32,322 --> 01:15:34,458
What are you searching for, sister?

1198
01:15:34,459 --> 01:15:36,062
- I'm looking for a man.

1199
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,231
- Tell us about him.

1200
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:38,868
Was he in your heart?

1201
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:41,072
- No, he was in my car.

1202
01:15:41,073 --> 01:15:43,011
- Well, spiritually.

1203
01:15:43,012 --> 01:15:44,916
He is everywhere we go.

1204
01:15:46,051 --> 01:15:48,423
And we call him Jesus.

1205
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:49,925
- No, I call him Freddy.

1206
01:15:49,926 --> 01:15:51,495
Hallelujah!

1207
01:15:51,496 --> 01:15:53,367
- Why don't you turn around

1208
01:15:53,368 --> 01:15:56,640
and share your experience with us.

1209
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:58,043
Amen!

1210
01:15:58,044 --> 01:15:59,447
- Brothers and sisters.

1211
01:15:59,448 --> 01:16:00,915
Amen!

1212
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:04,122
- It all started when I was a kid.

1213
01:16:04,123 --> 01:16:07,297
I was raised by my grandfather.

1214
01:16:07,298 --> 01:16:10,570
And we didn't have no clothes, no food.

1215
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:13,843
We were so poor,
one time burglar broke into house.

1216
01:16:13,844 --> 01:16:15,615
We robbed him. - Amen!

1217
01:16:16,584 --> 01:16:17,852
- Amen.

1218
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:20,525
- But, seriously, folks.

1219
01:16:20,526 --> 01:16:25,034
Today, people are so,
what do you call it, materialistic.

1220
01:16:25,035 --> 01:16:26,270
- Materialistic.

1221
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:28,007
- That's the word.

1222
01:16:28,008 --> 01:16:32,618
- Money is not the
most important thing in life.

1223
01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:35,189
- The most important thing
in life is broads.

1224
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,760
Broads!- Amen!

1225
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:38,029
Broads?

1226
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:38,865
- Broads?

1227
01:16:40,368 --> 01:16:42,806
- Sister, you cannot say blasphemous things

1228
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,509
in this holy church.

1229
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:45,747
Repent, repent!

1230
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:48,685
- Did I do something wrong?

1231
01:16:48,686 --> 01:16:51,157
- Moony, moony, moony!

1232
01:16:51,158 --> 01:16:54,631
Moony, moony, moony, moony!

1233
01:16:54,632 --> 01:16:58,640
Moony, moony, moony,
moony, moony, moony, moony.

1234
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:03,050
Moony, moony, moony, moony.

1235
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,891
Moony, Moony, Moony, Moony.

1236
01:17:06,892 --> 01:17:08,662
Moony, Moony, Moony, Moony.

1237
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:21,656
- Peter, I mean, Freddy!

1238
01:17:21,657 --> 01:17:23,227
- Run!

1239
01:17:23,228 --> 01:17:24,330
Run!

1240
01:17:24,331 --> 01:17:26,233
- Wait a minute.

1241
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:28,305
- I'll take care of this.

1242
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:34,485
Say, blood, give me five yo mamma get down.

1243
01:17:37,023 --> 01:17:39,194
- What you mean, yo mamma?

1244
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,635
- Wait a minute,
I know where you comin' from,

1245
01:17:42,636 --> 01:17:45,475
but you gotta get it together. Do like I do.

1246
01:17:45,476 --> 01:17:46,310
Say blood.

1247
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:50,620
Say blood.

1248
01:17:51,589 --> 01:17:52,990
- Say blood.

1249
01:17:52,991 --> 01:17:54,428
- Naw, say blood.

1250
01:17:56,131 --> 01:17:57,333
- What's happenin'?

1251
01:17:57,334 --> 01:17:59,069
- What's happenin'?

1252
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:01,241
- Say, foo, what's yo name.

1253
01:18:01,242 --> 01:18:04,415
- Say, foo, they call me Bruce.

1254
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:05,585
Bruce?

1255
01:18:07,356 --> 01:18:08,590
- What's yours?

1256
01:18:08,591 --> 01:18:10,160
- I'm Curtis.

1257
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:13,067
- Curtis, this fool be Freddy.

1258
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,269
- Curtis, it's a pleasure.

1259
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,873
I want you to know you all run very fast.

1260
01:18:15,874 --> 01:18:17,276
- We know that.

1261
01:18:17,277 --> 01:18:18,712
- Yeah, so, what's your problem.

1262
01:18:18,713 --> 01:18:22,554
- Man, some dudes chasin' us all over.

1263
01:18:22,555 --> 01:18:24,859
And they're from mafia.

1264
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,029
Mafia?

1265
01:18:27,732 --> 01:18:30,572
- So, what you need is some protection.

1266
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:31,475
- Right on!

1267
01:18:33,645 --> 01:18:35,884
- You all come from us, we'll hide you.

1268
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:51,583
- Whoa!

1269
01:18:51,584 --> 01:18:54,424
What are these stuff in this room?

1270
01:18:54,425 --> 01:18:57,563
- They're some electronic gadgets.

1271
01:18:57,564 --> 01:18:59,935
- That's an electric chair.

1272
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:04,109
Yeah.

1273
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:06,851
Uh, must be Curtis with the food.

1274
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:20,980
- Hi, Bruce.

1275
01:19:20,981 --> 01:19:23,854
Hello, you look familiar.

1276
01:19:24,823 --> 01:19:26,725
- May I come in?

1277
01:19:26,726 --> 01:19:27,928
Yes.

1278
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:28,931
- Thank you.

1279
01:19:30,335 --> 01:19:32,738
Don't you recognize me?

1280
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:34,743
We met in Ginelli's bar.

1281
01:19:36,781 --> 01:19:37,617
- Oh.

1282
01:19:38,752 --> 01:19:40,756
She's the lady who gave me this necklace.

1283
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:43,795
- Oh, yeah, you're the one

1284
01:19:43,796 --> 01:19:45,599
with all the moanin' and the kissin'

1285
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,606
and the breathin' in his ear, huh?

1286
01:19:48,607 --> 01:19:51,010
- Look, I'm a federal agent.

1287
01:19:51,011 --> 01:19:52,714
- Oh my God.

1288
01:19:52,715 --> 01:19:55,721
- The necklace I gave you
was an electronic microphone.

1289
01:19:55,722 --> 01:19:57,359
We've monitored all your conversations.

1290
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,464
We know your locations
all over the country.

1291
01:19:59,465 --> 01:20:00,467
- Oh my God.

1292
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:03,905
- Can't you say anything but oh my God?

1293
01:20:03,906 --> 01:20:05,743
- They used you, Bruce.

1294
01:20:05,744 --> 01:20:07,582
You were their stooge.

1295
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:10,185
You weren't delivering flour,

1296
01:20:10,186 --> 01:20:12,358
you were delivering cocaine.

1297
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:14,227
Drugs, Bruce.

1298
01:20:14,228 --> 01:20:15,063
- Drugs.

1299
01:20:17,168 --> 01:20:18,270
Oh my Buddha.

1300
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,947
I've been delivering drugs.

1301
01:20:25,085 --> 01:20:26,355
Oh, forgive me.

1302
01:20:28,793 --> 01:20:31,232
- Bruce, I was gonna tell ya.

1303
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,572
But, you know, I took an oath.

1304
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,449
- Don't blame Freddy.

1305
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,617
If he'd said anything,

1306
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:43,024
they would've killed him and you.

1307
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:48,201
- I took an oath too.

1308
01:20:48,202 --> 01:20:49,372
For Bruce Lee.

1309
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:53,045
Now I have disgraced him.

1310
01:20:53,046 --> 01:20:54,448
- Not yet.

1311
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:56,652
You can still make up for everything.

1312
01:20:56,653 --> 01:20:58,756
We'll get an amnesty for Freddy.

1313
01:20:58,757 --> 01:21:00,161
I need your help.

1314
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:06,307
- Now you want me to be your stooge?

1315
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:08,378
- If we can catch these guys,

1316
01:21:08,379 --> 01:21:10,582
we can stop the entire distribution

1317
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:13,288
of all the drugs in the underworld.

1318
01:21:13,289 --> 01:21:15,927
When we do that, we can find your lady.

1319
01:21:15,928 --> 01:21:18,368
But, I need your help, Bruce.

1320
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,872
- I must help you.

1321
01:21:21,907 --> 01:21:24,112
That's all there is to say.

1322
01:21:36,574 --> 01:21:37,642
- Here we go.

1323
01:21:39,946 --> 01:21:42,117
- Well, well, Freddy.

1324
01:21:42,118 --> 01:21:46,727
Now, I'm glad to see that
you’ve decided to make up for your

1325
01:21:46,728 --> 01:21:48,231
unhealthy mistake.

1326
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:50,736
Where is it?

1327
01:21:50,737 --> 01:21:53,141
- If we give it to you know,
you'll kill us.

1328
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:53,977
- Freddy.

1329
01:21:54,946 --> 01:21:57,583
You're already a dead man.

1330
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:58,786
- Well, Bruce.

1331
01:21:58,787 --> 01:22:01,025
I guess you'd better give it to him.

1332
01:22:01,026 --> 01:22:02,528
- You see?

1333
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:04,968
You're braver than I thought.

1334
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:08,707
Hey, where is it?

1335
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:11,415
Kya!

1336
01:22:24,677 --> 01:22:27,883
Hey, Bruce, the enemy went that way!

1337
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:51,233
Hold it, freeze!

1338
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:57,312
- Move it, on the car, on the car!

1339
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:06,801
- Hello, Boss.

1340
01:23:09,674 --> 01:23:11,510
I hope you like the food in hoosegow

1341
01:23:11,511 --> 01:23:15,686
Otherwise I'll have to bring
Chinese noodles for you.

1342
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:21,900
Freddy, wait.

1343
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:26,844
- Oh, man, Bruce, what do you want?

1344
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:31,420
- I want you to have this.

1345
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:32,589
- Aw, no, man.

1346
01:23:35,329 --> 01:23:39,269
- So I always know where my best friend it.

1347
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:42,177
- You make me laugh, you know,
you always make me laugh.

1348
01:23:51,229 --> 01:23:53,802
Come on, driver, let's go, huh?

1349
01:23:55,539 --> 01:23:56,807
You think there's a bar around here

1350
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:59,415
or somethin' on the way, maybe?

1351
01:24:02,186 --> 01:24:03,356
- Arrivederci.

1352
01:24:13,176 --> 01:24:16,751

That's the lady.

- Wow.

01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:32,250
My grandfather was right.

1358
01:24:32,251 --> 01:24:35,290
She is the most
beautiful lady in the world.

1359
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:37,796
- Your grandfather meant America.

1360
01:24:37,797 --> 01:24:40,167
America will take care of you.

1361
01:24:40,168 --> 01:24:41,004
Come on.

1362
