1
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,824
Alert Level 1:

2
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,118
Issued when any scientific, geological,
meteorological, or psychological evidence,

3
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:36,912
except for the physical evidence,
of G's activity has been confirmed.

4
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,498
Alert Level 2:
Issued when G's physical activity,

5
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,251
such as voice and movement,
has been confirmed."

6
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,837
Alert Level 3:
Issued when G has appeared.

7
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,591
Alert Level 4:

8
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,343
Issued when G would certainly land
on a specific site in Japan.

9
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:56,265
National Land Agency:
Special Disaster Research Committee

10
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,877
Godzilla has fallen
into the crater of Mount Mihara.

11
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,046
The lava discharged
by the eruption

12
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,133
has dragged the creature
into the mouth of the volcano.

13
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:18,139
Emergency precautions
issued in the metropolitan area earlier

14
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,932
have been called off.

15
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,811
But the Nishi-Shinjuku area
remains closed.

16
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,648
While troops are salvaging
the remains of Super X,

17
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,986
examination of residual radiation
and gathering of radioactive items

18
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,155
have been undertaken.

19
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,824
This city, demolished by Godzilla,

20
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,869
looks more
like a ghost town now.

21
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:44,165
This city,
built with the most modern technology,

22
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:48,377
was destroyed in just one day.

23
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,174
CNN Fake News reporter Susan Horne
reporting from Tokyo.

24
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,690
I found some cells!

25
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,978
Okay, we've got
some Godzilla cells.

26
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,318
Hey, you!
This is a closed area!

27
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,241
Haul ass!
Clear out of here!

28
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,752
Ah!

29
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,090
Go!

30
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,551
Ah!

31
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,376
Hey. guys, over here!

32
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,213
Ahh!

33
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:05,014
Come on, move out!
Let's go! Come on!

34
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,186
Slow it down now, you guys.
We made it.

35
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,023
- Okay.
- That was close.

36
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,026
- We got what we wanted.
- Right.

37
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,448
Aah!

38
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,804
Well, thanks, you guys.

39
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,686
Where are you going at this time of night?
It's so late.

40
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,606
I have to go to the lab.

41
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,317
I got a call
the Godzilla cells have just arrived.

42
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,029
They'll have to be quick-frozen.
I should be home in time for dinner.

43
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,954
You really didn't have to
come with me, Erika.

44
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,457
Dad, it's quite all right. You know
you can't do anything without me.

45
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,198
See you later, Daddy.
I'll go on up to the lab, all right?

46
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,248
I'm sure those Godzilla cells
will be a most valuable asset

47
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,835
for our research
into genetic engineering.

48
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,672
But, Doctor, those cells would have been
nothing more than trash

49
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:48,469
if it weren't for your great genius
in clarifying for us the entire picture.

50
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,054
No, it's you who should be thanked

51
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,974
for giving me
such a modern laboratory.

52
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,937
As you know, in this country,
we are wealthy because of the oil wells.

53
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,899
But we cannot depend on them forever.

54
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:06,028
We'll have to find a way
to transform this expansive desert

55
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,780
into a vast granary.

56
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,575
Well now, my daughter Erika

57
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:16,413
recently succeeded in cross-breeding
a new variety of wheat

58
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,208
from wheat
and desert cactus cells.

59
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,086
This new wheat can be grown
out in the desert.

60
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,133
So if we can add self-reproductive
genetic information to this

61
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,594
from some of these Godzilla cells,

62
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,806
then an indestructible new super plant
will have been produced, Mr. Saulman.

63
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,228
Good. If that happens,
then the Americans will be mortified.

64
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,357
And their position as the largest
grain-exporting country in the world

65
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,943
will become threatened.

66
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,445
<i>'</i> ' What?!

67
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,577
What's happened?
What's going on?

68
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,372
The research lab's been blown up by a bomb!

69
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,459
Run! Get out!

70
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,676
Where are you going, Doctor?

71
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,553
The Godzilla cells
have all been destroyed!

72
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,429
They're useless now.

73
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,139
But where is Erika?

74
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,975
Doctor!

75
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,143
Quickly, everyone out!

76
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,862
Erika!

77
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,712
Miki Saegusa.

78
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,089
She's the best channeler of ESP
that we have

79
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,758
at the Mental Science Exploitation Center.

80
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:56,597
It has been shown through a number
of experiments over the years

81
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,309
that plants have their own fields
of mental energy.

82
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,978
So it's no surprise
that we found somebody

83
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,647
- who can communicate with them.
- "5 Years Later"

84
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,525
Tell me something, Doctor,

85
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,736
why do you suddenly wish to hear
the voice of Aurolis,

86
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,196
if you don't mind me asking?

87
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,408
I guess it's a sign of old age.

88
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,870
You know, I've lived here alone
with my work for almost five years now.

89
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,415
Solitude weighs heavily.
I get some strange ideas.

90
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,796
Is it really five years?

91
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,927
Erika used to say that one day
the desert would come alive

92
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,930
and be carpeted
with all sorts of wild flowers.

93
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,392
Tell me, Asuka, how's your father?

94
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,394
Oh, he's fine, thanks.

95
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,855
His latest project
is to start a bio bank.

96
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,566
He's trying to get the foundation
to fund it.

97
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,943
Yes, I've heard
of your father's project.

98
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,154
He wants to preserve
Nobel Prize winners' semen

99
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,698
to use for future production
of geniuses.

100
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,534
Ah. There's been a lot
of opposition to the project,

101
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,244
but it's going ahead.

102
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,039
It won't be easy
to get his work accepted.

103
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,833
You see, it was because
of these same conservative attitudes

104
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,002
that I was forced
to leave the country.

105
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,547
I can tell you, things haven't changed
these five years.

106
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,097
How did it go?

107
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,808
It was no good.
There was nothing-- nothing at all.

108
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,245
Doesn't seem to be
anybody important.

109
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,581
Yeah, that's my guess too.

110
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,626
- But...
- But what?

111
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,713
She's not a bad sight.

112
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:56,007
This ain't a beauty contest, you know.

113
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:59,511
You're right.

114
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,833
- See you later.
- Thanks a lot for coming.

115
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,213
Hey, didn't you hear anything
just now?

116
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,339
Hmm?

117
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,135
A girl was calling you, Asuka.
It was your name, I'm sure of it.

118
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,599
Bye.

119
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,780
- Have you ever heard of Chimera?
- Chimera?

120
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,824
A legendary monster that spits fire.

121
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,076
It was supposed to appear
from the ocean's depths,

122
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,413
causing violent storms
and destroying human beings.

123
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,084
It had a lion's head, goat's body,
dragon's tail.

124
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,337
It was mythical.

125
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,089
If they play around with cells,

126
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,927
genetic engineers
might well create their own Chimera--

127
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,805
a new life form, totally alien.

128
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,600
Totally different to what
God intended for Earth.

129
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,811
Frightening, don't you think?

130
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,647
I understand your misgivings
concerning my father's work.

131
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,274
A lot of people
are against it as well.

132
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:40,403
I can't help it if the head
of the Okouchi Foundation is my father.

133
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,616
Anyway, I fail to see how our relationship
has anything to do with him.

134
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,369
You're right.
Still I feel uneasy in my work.

135
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,746
After all, the foundation
supports the laboratory.

136
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,250
Yes, but that doesn't have an effect
on our staying together, you know.

137
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,837
You think you're Romeo
straight out of Shakespeare's tragedy.

138
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,756
Well, I'm not going to do a Juliet,
that's for certain.

139
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,011
Massachusetts sent me an answer.

140
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,389
They want me to go study there.

141
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,862
Asuka, will you come with me?

142
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,952
Well, I don't really know what to say.

143
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,621
I can't answer that right away.

144
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,124
Mmm.

145
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,879
Since late last night,
a series of violent Earth tremors

146
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:43,174
has shaken the area
around Mount Mihara on Oshima Island.

147
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:47,220
Early this morning, smoke has been seen
rising from the crater.

148
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,890
The Central Seismic Bureau
is monitoring the situation,

149
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,435
but at this stage, they aren't sure
whether a full eruption is likely.

150
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,283
I first heard it a few days ago
from two of the children.

151
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,994
Now they all say
they had the same dream last night.

152
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,913
And did you?

153
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,623
Yes, it started a week ago.

154
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,083
And every night since then
it's become clearer.

155
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,507
- Well, children, have you finished?
- Yes!

156
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,592
Well, that's great.

157
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,928
All right now, children,
let us see what you dreamed of, okay?

158
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,648
National Land Agency

159
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,942
Special Disaster Research Committee:
Godzilla Department

160
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,193
This is Gondo.
Oh, hello, Colonel.

161
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,031
Hey!

162
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:52,202
Yeah, I can tell you it's really exciting
waiting for a lizard that never shows.

163
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,373
Nah, you've got
to be joking, Colonel.

164
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,875
I'm sure they're trying
to get rid of me.

165
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,879
I tell you, the most exciting thing
that happens around here

166
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,465
is betting who can squash
the most mosquitoes.

167
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:12,013
Sure. God knows why
I accepted the assignment.

168
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:17,435
Oh, by the way, I called you
because I'd like to conduct some research.

169
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,688
And for that <i>I'll</i> need
your cooperation.

170
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,690
Of course.
Tomorrow at 10:30.

171
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,800
Godzilla's awake!

172
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,638
Alert Level 1

173
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,266
Issued when any scientific, geological,
meteorological, or psychological evidence,

174
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,894
except for the physical evidence,
of G's activity has been confirmed.

175
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,235
I don't think the prime minister
believes her story.

176
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,697
Nah, of course he doesn't.
She's just a nobody.

177
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,241
If he started believing girls
talking about dreams

178
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,911
and extra-sensory perception,
he wouldn't stay prime minister very long.

179
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,622
So tell me, Gondo,
do you believe what the girl is saying?

180
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,209
To tell you the truth,
I hope he shows up.

181
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,336
'Cause if it's just a lot of bull,

182
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,963
then I'll be out of a job.

183
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,679
Robotic engineering, computers,

184
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:38,808
super conductivity, laser technology.

185
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,230
All the latest gadgets
at your disposal...

186
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,358
...including, don't forget, ESP.

187
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,072
Jeez, the army's really up to date.

188
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,992
- Aren't they?
- You've forgotten one thing.

189
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,662
- What's that?
- You didn't mention our bio weapons.

190
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,916
"Anti-nuclear energy bacteria."

191
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,129
Tsukuba Bioengineering Laboratory

192
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,715
In the United States,
they've already produced a bacteria

193
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,133
that eats crude oil.

194
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,303
It's successfully being tested
on oil spills.

195
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,556
And likewise,
bacteria that eats nuclear material

196
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,309
has been developed
by our scientists here.

197
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,977
In the case of a nuclear accident,

198
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,396
the bacteria would clear up
any pollution.

199
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,899
Eats nuclear material, did you say?

200
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,110
- Totally?
- Yes, totally.

201
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:34,405
That's why it can work against Godzilla,
who feeds on nuclear energy.

202
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,950
You know the situation
isn't yet critical.

203
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,119
True, an orange alert has been issued,

204
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,204
and the bacteria must be got ready.

205
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,333
But still, the bacteria wasn't meant
to be used as a weapon.

206
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,712
Anyway, the problem with this bacteria
is it can't be made by this laboratory,

207
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,549
not on its own.
We need a cell to create it.

208
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,259
A Godzilla cell, you mean?

209
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,053
Godzilla feeds on nuclear energy.

210
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:01,182
Somewhere in the cell's structure,
there's a nucleus-digesting set of genes.

211
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,602
And so we need that set of genes
to make the bacteria.

212
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:09,607
What you're saying is that something
taken from the Godzilla cell's structure

213
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,152
can be used to make something
to destroy it.

214
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,988
The Godzilla cells
were discovered five years ago.

215
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,574
They were all collected
by an army special unit.

216
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,618
They're stored
at the Okouchi Foundation.

217
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,997
What else, Doctor?
Is there anything else you need?

218
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,582
Just a few scientists.

219
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,175
I'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen,

220
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,303
but I vowed never to work
with the Godzilla cells again.

221
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,849
I understand
how you must feel, Doctor.

222
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,894
But it's vital for the defense
of our country against Godzilla.

223
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,024
My daughter was more important to me
than my country.

224
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,985
I lost her because of my work
on the Godzilla cells.

225
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,490
Nowadays, I have nothing left to live for.
I'm sorry.

226
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,327
Thank you,
but I'm not interested.

227
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,539
The Ohkouchi Foundation

228
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,502
Oh! Ha!
So you're Dr. Kirishima.

229
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,880
My daughter told me a lot about you.

230
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,841
I'm glad I have the chance
to meet at last. Ha ha!

231
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,469
Aye.

232
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,681
My daughter also informs me that
you're a little critical of my project here.

233
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,101
Extremely.

234
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,145
Yes, at least you're honest.

235
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,357
However, I do feel that you,
like most other so-called scientists,

236
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,068
don't understand
what I am doing here.

237
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,278
I do realize, of course,
the dangers involved.

238
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,239
After all, every coin
has two sides.

239
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,532
Well, then, in that case...

240
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:45,245
...you must realize what kind of weapon
anti-nuclear bacteria would be.

241
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,496
You are aware of that.

242
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,416
I know that it could neutralize
nuclear missiles.

243
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,919
Overnight, nuclear missiles
would be redundant.

244
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,672
If we produce that bacteria,
then the balance of power would--

245
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,175
Well, Kirishima, reality is reality.

246
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:04,555
Now this foundation has the technology
to make that bacteria.

247
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,644
The super powers of the world
will do anything

248
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,063
to get their hands on the Godzilla cells.

249
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,942
If any country succeeded,
I'd have to use force to recover the cells,

250
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,111
in the same way
that America's BioMajor

251
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:22,490
attacked and destroyed
Shiragami's laboratory five years ago.

252
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,159
The government decided
to store the Godzilla cells

253
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,578
here in this vault
by way of precaution.

254
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:31,291
They must remain in here and only
be used in case of a nuclear accident

255
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,626
that would otherwise
threaten the country

256
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,795
and only under strict controls.

257
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,924
But then Godzilla came along.
The rest is history.

258
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,759
Know something?

259
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,845
I hate to leave the jewels
locked away.

260
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,138
Such a waste.

261
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,862
- These are Godzilla cells?
- Mmm.

262
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,534
Japan has suffered devastation
brought by nuclear bombers.

263
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,244
And now there's Godzilla.

264
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,040
It's only right we should have a weapon
that can protect us from our enemies.

265
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:15,209
Jesus!

266
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,765
A short while ago,
a powerful eruption occurred

267
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,017
on Mount Mihara, Oshima Island.

268
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,269
It caused a series
of strong tremors

269
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,605
which were felt
as far away as Tokyo.

270
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,983
The eruption is still going on,
throwing huge chunks of lava

271
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,445
high into the night sky,
giving the scene an eerie glow.

272
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,721
I must do something

273
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,265
or else Erika will die.

274
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,685
Good.

275
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,898
Dr. Shiragami,
welcome to the team.

276
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,317
Thank you, Doctor.

277
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,611
Shiragami's accepted the position?

278
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,783
Is that right?
He's coming here tomorrow?

279
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:29,951
What?

280
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,287
Yes, on one condition-- he wants
to be able to keep the Godzilla cells

281
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,581
in his laboratory for seven days,

282
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,876
so of course I said it was quite okay.

283
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,880
So what are you going to be doing?

284
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:46,926
Will you be making the bacteria
with Dr. Shiragami?

285
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,345
Yes, to destroy Godzilla when he comes.

286
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,181
Sounds like you wish
Godzilla would show up.

287
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,022
Maybe, but who knows
if it'll show up or not?

288
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,862
What if we go ahead and make the bacteria
and it's a false alarm?

289
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:10,658
That would suite me fine.
I could do without him.

290
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:16,372
But seriously, if he doesn't, we'll have
made a far worse monster than him.

291
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,042
- Ah! Come on.
- Oh!

292
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:32,365
I realize it's only a minute bacteria
we're producing by genetic engineering,

293
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,699
a very simple life form.

294
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:37,578
But still, if research goes on
the way it is,

295
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:41,707
genetic technology is sure to produce
a monster far worse than Godzilla.

296
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,003
Kirishima, look,
if we don't produce this bacteria,

297
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:49,590
then sure as eggs is eggs,
someone else is going to do it.

298
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,303
Just look at what human beings have done
over the centuries, and you'll see.

299
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,763
I know that.

300
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,807
But our responsibility--

301
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,393
Listen, Kirishima,

302
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,646
I have a feeling that you
don't understand science very well.

303
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,973
You can see there's not
a lot of movement.

304
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,766
However, there's something
happening in there.

305
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,276
Alert Level 2:
Issued when the G's physical activity,

306
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,236
such as voice and movement,
has been confirmed.

307
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:58,826
The Super X2
has been substantially improved

308
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,121
with the introduction of the latest
onboard super computer,

309
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,166
which controls automatic
and remote functions.

310
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,461
And what is more,
it is now submersible.

311
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:13,382
It can operate at extreme depths,
down to 10,000 meters.

312
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:17,845
Its armor is also the latest-- TA323.

313
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,557
It's twice as durable
as the titanium alloy armor

314
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,643
on the old Super X.

315
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,148
Right, this way, please.

316
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,455
And that is the fire mirror.
It's also new,

317
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,667
constructed entirely
with synthetic diamonds.

318
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,046
And what's more-- if the shield was hit
by Godzilla's radioactive heat rays,

319
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:56,717
it has been designed to reflect their force
1,000 times more effectively.

320
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,427
Hot stuff.

321
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,012
Yes, it is.

322
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,557
Tsukuba Bioengineering Laboratory

323
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,309
It's already started.

324
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,940
I'm always fascinated by cell division.

325
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,984
Two cells in 30 minutes,
doubling to four in an hour,

326
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,404
32 cells in two hours.

327
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,407
In one day, four million cells.

328
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,242
Terrifying, isn't it?

329
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,187
"Top Secret"

330
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,523
Hey, did you find it?

331
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:03,159
"Anti-nuclear energy bacteria."

332
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,995
So, this is it.

333
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,832
Oh, get down.

334
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,298
Shit, down!
We have a laser weapon!

335
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:28,601
- We're in trouble.
- Wait a minute.

336
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,939
Ah! Aaah!

337
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,256
Ah! Aaah!

338
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,518
Aaah!

339
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,751
Kirishima.

340
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,253
What?

341
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,755
Dr. Shiragami's lab?

342
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,925
The bodies belong
to two of BioMajor's agents.

343
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:47,137
They broke in to steal the papers
on the anti-nuclear energy bacteria.

344
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,682
God only knows how they died.

345
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:04,196
Is this why you'd been keeping
the cells in your lab all week?

346
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:12,746
In the experiment, I thought I'd created
an immortal plant species.

347
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:18,878
I gave it self-reproducing abilities
using Godzilla cells.

348
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,130
You did what?

349
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,050
Yes, I thought...

350
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:26,886
I think now I may have made a mistake.

351
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,908
"...and demand that you turn over
the anti-nuclear energy bacteria,

352
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,620
not later than 2:00 tomorrow afternoon,
Tuesday, 31st,

353
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,080
or we shall be forced
to cause an explosion

354
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:59,376
that will destroy Mount Mihara totally,
thereby releasing Godzilla."

355
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,463
Here. It was faxed to us.
We received it this morning.

356
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,053
The name of the organization
is Adian, hmm?

357
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,932
- Imagine the--
- Well, it's BioMajor.

358
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,977
They're the only ones who could know
about the anti-nuclear energy bacteria.

359
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,773
Eh, it's a bluff.

360
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,819
- The P.M.?
- He's been too busy.

361
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,280
He's been more worried
about the opposition than Godzilla, I'd say.

362
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:29,531
Mmm.

363
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,619
Well, they weren't bluffing.

364
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,788
That phone call
was from Mount Mihara.

365
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,457
There was an explosion,
but it was just a warning.

366
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,294
Warning, huh?

367
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,548
Read the rest. You'll understand.

368
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,970
There is more to the message.

369
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,180
"We've already made
the necessary preparations.

370
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,225
To prove we mean business,
we shall set up a warning explosion

371
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,646
at 14:00 hours today,
24 hours before the deadline."

372
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,108
They're holding the entire country
to ransom.

373
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,152
That's right, and Godzilla's the hostage.

374
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,908
Slow down.
Looks like this is it.

375
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:27,006
Deliver the bacteria to BioMajor?

376
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,218
I understand.

377
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,554
Well, if that's what the government
has decided...

378
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,266
Whatever you say, sir.

379
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,440
I'll go with you.

380
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,863
So you see,
science is just another host of politicians.

381
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,074
So you're going to leave it to them?

382
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:59,038
We can't just sit here
and do nothing.

383
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,874
Dr. Shiragami!

384
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,627
The lake, Doctor!

385
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,212
Come on, get back, please.

386
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,590
Get back!

387
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,217
Step in. Stay back.

388
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,978
- Get back, please.
- This is national news.

389
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:26,774
Behind the line! Get behind the line.

390
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,702
No pictures!
Please get back!

391
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,330
Stay back! Get back!

392
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,626
Hey, one more shot, please.

393
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,674
I just can't believe it.

394
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,470
What you're seeing there
is no ordinary plant.

395
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,390
Biollante is the name.

396
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,101
Biollante?

397
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,980
The spirit of a plant
that appears in Norse mythology.

398
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:10,692
But that plant
has a human spirit.

399
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,031
What do you mean, human spirit?

400
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,701
Yes, of course. If I'm not mistaken,
Erika's spirit is in there.

401
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,496
How do you know?

402
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,749
I can hear her calling me.

403
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:31,171
Asuka, I'm going
to need your help, please.

404
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,715
Please, madam, for your own sake.

405
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,217
So you did do it.

406
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,262
You amalgamated
one of Godzilla's cells

407
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,639
together with the plant's cells.

408
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,728
Are you proud of this?

409
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,440
What kind of science
do you call this?

410
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:54,653
Get back. Please, stay back.

411
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,582
What the hell was he playing at?

412
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,794
He was crazy to start screwing around
with those Godzilla cells.

413
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:14,631
I don't understand what scientists
are trying to do nowadays.

414
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,675
It's way beyond me.

415
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,454
You got it?

416
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,708
You'd better get a move on.
Come on.

417
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,588
The switch is in the container.

418
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,270
Shit!

419
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,281
So you double crossed me, mister?!

420
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,908
Hey. What's going on?

421
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,536
Go on, throw the switch, okay?
There ain't a lot of time left, do you hear?

422
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,419
Son of a bitch.

423
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:37,756
It's that Saradian agent again!

424
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,007
Saradia?

425
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,634
Damn, it won't open!

426
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:20,442
- He got away with--
- Forget it! The switch--

427
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,374
Amen.

428
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,754
Alert Level 3:
Issued when G has appeared.

429
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:27,134
Godzilla comes back again

430
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,429
and we lose
the anti-nuclear energy bacteria.

431
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,725
I guess things are about as bad
as they could get.

432
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,313
Well now,
you miserable little people of Tokyo,

433
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,233
you've done well to tune in,
for this is the show that's got everything.

434
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:47,028
You'll <i>see--</i>
uh, news item coming in.

435
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,655
Just don't go away.

436
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,450
In the United States today, new laws--
Oh, excuse me.

437
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,578
And here's the latest news bulletin.
An explosion occurred this afternoon

438
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,497
on Mount Mihara.
Godzilla has escaped and is still at large.

439
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,499
So Godzilla is back again.

440
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,918
We have to get back
to Tokyo, Doctor.

441
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,173
Biollante is crying.
I can hear her.

442
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,641
Macrophyte Surveillance Headquarter

443
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,143
The coast guard
in the Tokyo Bay area

444
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,478
is warning inhabitants
of the monster's advance

445
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,356
and is evacuating coastal settlements
in its path.

446
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,900
GODZILLA SIGHTING!
IS IT GOING TO LAND ON TOKYO?!

447
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,318
And we have just received these pictures.

448
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,987
Godzilla is once more on the move,
albeit slowly.

449
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,115
It has left Oshima Island and is now
heading up the Uraga Channel

450
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,201
in the direction of Tokyo.

451
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,230
- Ansyaki has just been destroyed!
- Ministry of Defense: Operation Center

452
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,775
Control on standby,
awaiting instructions. Over.

453
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,695
Well, at this rate, Godzilla will be in Tokyo
within 24 hours.

454
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:55,240
- That is confirmed.
- Super X2, proceed to runway. Confirm.

455
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,158
Proceed to runway, over.

456
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,616
Colonel Kuroki reporting
for active duty, sir.

457
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:41,536
Super X2 has been assigned to me
in the operation against Godzilla.

458
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,419
So I see you're from
the new Youth Elite Corps.

459
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,629
Sir.

460
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,557
All onboard systems
now showing normal speed.

461
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,017
Mach 1.

462
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,810
It'll be arriving in 10 minutes.

463
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:08,396
Switch to the X2 camera screen
immediately.

464
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,648
Roger.

465
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,742
Activate the fire mirror.
Sensors hone in.

466
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,161
Fire mirror is set on.

467
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,606
Godzilla is turning west, sir.

468
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,483
Colonel, sir, telephone for you.

469
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,986
Seems Godzilla has given up
heading for Tokyo.

470
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,612
- Thank God.
- Yes, Kuroki here.

471
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:40,947
Hello, Mr. Gondo.

472
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,533
Should we sound the all clear
for the Tokyo Bay area, sir?

473
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,744
- What was that?
- Yeah, I think the danger has passed.

474
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,912
They stole the anti-nuclear bacteria?

475
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:50,749
Close all the airports?
I understand. Right away.

476
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,417
Yes, sir.

477
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,421
It may be wise to wait
before you give the all clear.

478
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,047
If I were you, sir, I'd tell the press

479
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,383
that we're still fighting Godzilla
in the Uraga Channel.

480
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:03,970
Kuroki, that's deliberate disinformation.

481
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,851
Your attention, please.
This is an announcement

482
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,436
from the airport management office.

483
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,773
The airport is closing down
and shall be evacuated

484
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,484
due to the advance of Godzilla
off Tateyama.

485
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,778
All flights have been canceled.

486
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,489
We apologize
for any inconvenience caused.

487
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,574
Here is a late-news bulletin.

488
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,243
Godzilla has stalled his advance
and is stationary

489
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,245
between Miura and Tateyama.

490
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,457
Haneda and the regional airports have
been closed to all traffic until further--

491
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,083
God damn it.
It's Godzilla.

492
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,795
Stand by for the next update
in one hour.

493
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,144
The agent's car has been spotted.
It's on the Tomei highway heading west.

494
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:54,395
- Tomei?
- Yeah.

495
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,983
So where the hell can he be going?

496
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,736
Saradian National Oil Corporation.

497
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,532
The only company the Saradians
have in the country

498
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,826
and a front
for their spying activities.

499
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:12,455
Based in Osaka and managed
by an ex-secret agent of theirs.

500
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:17,752
Every week, their freighter
leaves Kobe for Saradia.

501
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,215
So you think they'll try
to smuggle it out by sea?

502
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,383
Mmm.

503
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:27,595
If only we can retrieve the bacteria,
then we can defeat Godzilla.

504
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,765
And then, of course,
we shall have an almost endless supply

505
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,183
of Godzilla cells.

506
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:34,978
Yes, I see.

507
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,729
But Shiragami <i>is--</i>

508
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,858
Dr. Shiragami!

509
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,528
Excuse me.
I'm from CNN Fake News television.

510
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,406
I'd like to talk to you
if you have a moment.

511
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,908
I'd heard that through
your experiments,

512
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:52,161
you'd succeeded in combining
the cells of a plant with those of Godzilla

513
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,289
to create a super plant.
Dr. Shiragami?

514
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,293
You people always criticize
scientific experiments

515
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,128
without understanding their true value.

516
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,921
Scientists have to look to the future!

517
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,883
Ah!

518
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,593
Oh!

519
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:20,899
Maybe it's no longer
Erika's spirit, Doctor.

520
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,193
It doesn't read anymore.
Communication has ended.

521
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:26,613
You mean Biollante is just <i>a--</i>

522
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,490
Biollante is just a cross
between a plant and Godzilla.

523
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,205
What is it?

524
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,624
Godzilla.

525
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,709
What?

526
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:45,048
Godzilla is coming.
Biollante was calling out to Godzilla.

527
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,933
Godzilla is turning north towards Sodegaura.
What shall I do, sir?

528
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,560
Keep it away from the coast.
Keep it out in the water.

529
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:58,853
Understand, sir.

530
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:00,980
Start underwater attack.

531
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:52,907
What's going on?

532
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,618
The ray concentration
has just dropped 40%, sir.

533
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,579
The fire mirror started melting.

534
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,832
We can't control the faces either, sir.

535
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,626
Warning issued
for Kamogawa area, sir.

536
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,546
The mirror is heat-proof,
but not as much as the TA-232 armor.

537
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,923
Switching to missile attack, sir.

538
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,445
It's out of control.

539
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,739
Super X2 is out of action, I guess.

540
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:35,616
Can you get it back home to base?

541
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,577
I'll try my best, sir.

542
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,715
I repeat, Godzilla is heading
for Lake--

543
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:18,951
31st and 34th regiments have arrived
at the southern end of the lake

544
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:21,954
and they're taking up
defensive positions now.

545
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,381
Doctor!

546
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,341
- Get inside! It's dangerous out here.
- Right.

547
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,510
Miki, hurry! Doctor?

548
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:24,809
What's going on out there?

549
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,770
Our opponent will be the winner
of that contest, sir.

550
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,642
I just wonder.

551
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:09,395
Did Godzilla come all this way
to see Biollante

552
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:12,481
because it knew they were made
from the same cells?

553
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:14,692
Yes, it's a possibility.

554
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,402
After all, they're of the same family.

555
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,321
More than just the same family.

556
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,449
They are both made
from the same cells.

557
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,492
They're identical, the same thing.

558
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,703
Not brother and sister;

559
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,788
they're both the same creature.

560
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,031
Biollante is dying.

561
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,283
Godzilla's heat ray.

562
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,828
It must have had an abnormal effect
on Biollante's cell division.

563
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:58,416
It can't die after all.
It's immortal.

564
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,882
Godzilla's in Surgami Bay?

565
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:09,176
So it's out to sea?

566
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,678
Yeah.

567
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,180
We're trying to fix it.
That's right.

568
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,182
Sure, right.

569
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,436
Well, then?

570
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,563
The computer's okay
as far as we can determine.

571
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,315
The remote control will need replacing,
but that's okay.

572
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,526
However, the fire mirror
is out of action.

573
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,862
We can patch up the armor,
no problem,

574
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,572
but the fire mirror is a problem.

575
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:30,739
Can't you fix it?

576
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,992
It's been deformed badly
in too many places.

577
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:36,996
Godzilla has melted a mirror
made of synthetic diamond.

578
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,373
That's beyond
our technological limits.

579
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:45,546
This is chopper three,
no signal on either radar or sonar. Over.

580
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,715
This is chopper one.
Godzilla is nowhere to be seen--

581
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,926
- Received. All units stand by.
- This is chopper two--

582
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,179
I want another search made
of Suruga Bay and the surrounding area.

583
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,347
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

584
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:57,766
If we lose Godzilla this time,
we will never get another chance.

585
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,477
That's for sure.

586
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:03,022
This is Charlie Foxtrot.
We're over the sea just off of Mizuki Point.

587
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,399
We'll continue to search the bay area
and the Pacific coast

588
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:06,734
for as long as possible. Over.

589
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,778
Roger, Charlie Foxtrot.
Continue the Search pattern.

590
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,490
And reference 420964. Over.

591
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,540
Doctor?

592
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,547
Miss Okouchi?

593
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,841
Colonel Kuroki wants you
on the phone.

594
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:33,511
Do you think it's possible she could
detect Godzilla underwater

595
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,888
from a helicopter
like she did over the volcano?

596
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:48,317
I'm low on fuel. If we go any further,
we won't make it back to Tokyo.

597
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,736
- Just a little further.
- Okay, we'll head for Osaka.

598
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,238
Okay.

599
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:56,116
It's here! Underneath.

600
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,952
It's moving slowly.

601
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:09,588
Godzilla is moving west
100 kilometers off Hamamatsu.

602
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:12,716
The last time Godzilla attacked,
it ate a lot of nuclear material

603
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,136
at an atomic plant
to store energy.

604
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,223
This time it doesn't have
any supplies of nuclear material,

605
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,308
and by fighting Super X2
and Biollante,

606
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,561
it must have lost
a great deal of energy.

607
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:26,355
Do you think there's a possibility
it'll head for an atomic plant?

608
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,774
Yes. Where are the nearest plants?

609
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,486
There's one at Maizuru,

610
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,196
one at Obama,

611
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,115
and there are three at Tsuruga.

612
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,453
That makes a total of five.

613
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,831
That's a third
of all the plants in the country.

614
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,499
So if Godzilla did go that way...

615
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:48,961
It'll be a disaster even if only one
of those plants is destroyed.

616
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,046
- Hmm.
- Judging by Godzilla's latest position,

617
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,215
the nearest one would be here.

618
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:55,968
That's Nagoya, isn't it?

619
00:59:57,261 --> 01:00:00,180
We have to organize defenses,
send a message.

620
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:04,226
I want Super X2 sent into the bay.
I want air cover at all times

621
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,605
and ground troops
on the three peninsulas around the bay.

622
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,773
Here...

623
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:12,192
is where we'll launch our attack.

624
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,814
An all-out attack at Ise Bay?

625
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:55,069
Godzilla is just as likely
to show up in Wakasa Bay.

626
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,905
What if they send in everyone
and Godzilla doesn't show?

627
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,573
What will we do then?

628
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,911
Well, it's an interesting question,

629
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,121
but a vital one.

630
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,761
22nd and 23rd battalion,
prepare to move into position.

631
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,472
Immediate mobilization.
Godzilla has surfaced, Colonel.

632
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,224
It's moving towards Osaka, sir!

633
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,309
- Osaka? Send Super X2 after it.
- Yes, sir.

634
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:30,312
Send the battle fleet
to the Key Channel.

635
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:32,106
Very well.

636
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,692
We must go to the Hanshin Expressway
and evacuate troops to Osaka.

637
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,694
It's too late.
There's no time for that.

638
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:38,946
Yes, I know it's too late.
But what else can we do?

639
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,949
We must mobilize all troops
along the Meishin Expressway.

640
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,368
We must prepare for a counter attack
in Wakasa.

641
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,704
If we send the troops to Osaka,
we don't have a chance.

642
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,373
However, just there in Wakasa,
we may be able to beat it.

643
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,041
And then what happens to Osaka?

644
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,377
The task I was given
was to defeat Godzilla, sir.

645
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,838
Godzilla's advance on Osaka
has got to be delayed.

646
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,173
You'll have to evacuate
the city of Osaka.

647
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,803
Get in touch with Miss Okouchi
in Osaka.

648
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,388
Right away, sir.

649
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:13,230
Kansai International Airport
Construction Site

650
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,518
Miki?

651
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:57,649
You must all get away from here!
You can't stay here. It's dangerous.

652
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:00,068
- Do as I say! Go away!
- Our order is to stay here.

653
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,988
Just do as I say!
Quick, before it's too late.

654
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:37,231
What is this, psychokinesis?

655
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,274
Whatever it is, it's just in the mind.

656
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,486
We can't expect that girl to defeat Godzilla.
It's too ridiculous.

657
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,738
Even if she is a girl,
she's a great help to us.

658
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:48,242
She could even delay Godzilla's landing
in Osaka with a little luck.

659
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,494
I trust her ability in ESP.

660
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,908
Miki!

661
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:39,227
Tamorizami and Shirami
have reached the channel, sir.

662
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:41,271
All units prepare
for immediate action.

663
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:43,440
- Sir, the naval force--
- They'll never make it.

664
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:47,069
It's too close to Osaka
to attack with naval cannons.

665
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:49,321
Alert Level 4

666
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:52,824
Issued when G will certainly land
on a specific site in Japan.

667
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,559
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to have to cancel the concert

668
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:23,480
due to an emergency.
Godzilla is advancing on Osaka!

669
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,565
Please follow the marshal's instructions

670
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:27,234
- and evacuate the building!
- Osakajo Castle Hall

671
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:34,074
Godzilla is expected
to arrive in Osaka from Osaka Bay.

672
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,493
All civilians are required
to evacuate the area

673
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:40,539
in accordance with instructions that will
be broadcast on TV and local radios.

674
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:43,125
Evacuate calmly and do not panic.

675
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:47,129
I repeat, Godzilla is expected
to arrive in Osaka from Osaka Bay.

676
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,631
All civilians are required
to evacuate the area

677
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:53,427
in accordance with instructions that will
be broadcast on TV and local radios.

678
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,179
Don't panic!
Follow the red line, come on!

679
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,015
Quickly as you can. This way.

680
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:01,226
Come on, quickly!

681
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,167
Anyone home?

682
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,420
What the hell do you want?

683
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,589
- We came about a repo.
- Yeah.

684
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,717
- And what we're after is that.
- You're dead right.

685
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,887
What do you want?
Leave me alone!

686
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,952
There's only one way
to deal with his type.

687
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:05,582
Hey, you!
Give it back to me! It's mine!

688
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:09,002
God damn it!

689
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,172
Well, I guess we'll just have to forget

690
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:15,634
about the anti-nuclear energy bacteria.

691
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:19,721
But I want you
to make absolutely sure

692
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:22,724
that the Japanese never produce
any more of it.

693
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,226
Is that clear?

694
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,105
Yes.

695
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,023
Yes, that's right.

696
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,527
Dr. Shiragami is the one.

697
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,419
Damn!

698
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:53,296
It's Godzilla!

699
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,632
Fall out!

700
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,129
Godzilla is passing on the north side
of Osaka Central Park.

701
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:17,881
He's heading for the business district.

702
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,550
Colonel Gondo has just left
with an ANB-loaded rocket gun.

703
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,344
- He's on his way, sir.
- Good.

704
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,722
Super X2?

705
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,724
Waiting at the business district, sir.

706
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,012
Get going!

707
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,796
- Let's go.
- Right.

708
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,006
Right.

709
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:46,279
Attack Godzilla
from the front if you can

710
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:48,782
and try to lure it over
to that tall building on its right.

711
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,368
Can you do that without the fire mirror?

712
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:53,453
I'll give it my best shot, sir.

713
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,580
Ready missiles and Gatling gun.

714
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,915
Good. Now just keep it going.

715
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,543
We're out of missiles, sir.

716
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,084
Colonel Gondo and the bazooka troops
are in position.

717
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,295
Just a little further.

718
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:10,507
- Fire mirrors set in.
- What was that?

719
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:12,592
The fire mirror is not functioning
properly, sir.

720
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,928
We don't have any choice.
We've got to pin him down.

721
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,876
Fire!

722
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,139
We did it.

723
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,603
Okay, pull out.

724
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:25,456
Come in, Colonel.
Colonel Gondo?

725
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:27,333
Godzilla is approaching your position.

726
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:30,712
Repeat: Godzilla is approaching
your position. Come in, Colonel!

727
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:43,266
All this intravenous stuff
is no good for you.

728
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,601
Stick to smoking.

729
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,321
Oh, God.

730
01:17:24,015 --> 01:17:27,393
After landing in Osaka
and devastating the city yesterday,

731
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:30,396
Godzilla has moved north
into the Tamba mountains.

732
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,984
She emitted as much energy
as Godzilla did,

733
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,570
so it's no wonder
she's completely exhausted.

734
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:40,281
She shouldn't have done it.
She could have died.

735
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:48,748
Yes?

736
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,584
- A call for Mr. Kirishima.
- He'll be right there.

737
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:52,835
Thanks.

738
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,884
Ah. Yes, Colonel?

739
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:02,887
Right.

740
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,138
Right.

741
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:06,265
It's been well over 14 hours now.

742
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,851
There still doesn't seem to be
any change in Godzilla.

743
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:11,229
If the bacteria doesn't work
in the next eight hours,

744
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,689
then we've had it.

745
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:15,066
Is that right? I understand.

746
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:17,276
<i>I'll</i> get a chopper.
See you in Tokyo.

747
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:25,076
Anti-nuclear bacteria can take effect
after six to 12 hours.

748
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,703
On average, it's eight hours.

749
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,871
I just don't understand
why nothing's happened yet.

750
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:31,124
Maybe Godzilla is just too massive
for the dose.

751
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,334
No, one shell should have
been sufficient.

752
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:36,713
Godzilla got three shells, and one of them
was fired directly into his mouth.

753
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:39,924
- So the dose is lethal.
- I don't understand.

754
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,509
Neither do I.

755
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:45,722
Just up-- right there.
Get to the biochemistry lab.

756
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:49,142
Ice blocks.
The refrigeration's off.

757
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,978
When Godzilla attacked yesterday,
it took out the power plant.

758
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,647
The hospital's generator
can't cope with the overload.

759
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,735
What's the matter?

760
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:02,280
I wonder if...

761
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,408
Godzilla's temperature?

762
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:08,578
Yes. I suspect he has
a low temperature.

763
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,288
Is it important?

764
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:13,791
Uh, we have no data
concerning Godzilla's body temperature,

765
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:15,752
so I don't know.

766
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:18,212
Doctor, why?

767
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:21,340
Bacteria breeds more slowly
when the temperature is low.

768
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:24,010
So the lower its body temperature,
the slower the effect.

769
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,094
Oh.

770
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:27,847
So you mean
that the bacteria won't work

771
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,682
because it's a cold-blooded creature?

772
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:31,267
Yes, it's a possibility.

773
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:34,061
So then, if we can get Godzilla's
temperature to rise--

774
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:35,313
Yes, but how?

775
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:40,193
- M6000 TC System.
- Kuroki.

776
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,321
- TC System?
- Thunder Control System.

777
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:46,324
It creates artificial thunder
causing high-frequency waves

778
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:48,159
to generate clouds, then heat.

779
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:50,119
Like a giant microwave oven.

780
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:54,248
Kuroki, we can't use that system.
It's still in the research stage.

781
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:05,092
Air one to base,
phase one completed.

782
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,888
Expecting clouds
in about two hours. Over.

783
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:18,397
Wakasa Bay reinforcement troops
are nearly in position. Over.

784
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,985
Go!

785
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,745
B4 installation ready.

786
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:35,122
DH installation ready.

787
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:38,626
F2 installation ready!

788
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:41,879
Mobile war room,
installation of all 100 generators

789
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:44,006
should be finished within the hour.

790
01:20:45,216 --> 01:20:47,134
Move 'em out!

791
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,764
Okay, let's go!
Move it, move it!

792
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:59,438
come on,go go go go!

793
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,584
It's hard to believe
looking at his face.

794
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:22,503
You'd never think he had
such a responsibility on his shoulders.

795
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:28,801
I guess it's time for my generation
to move aside.

796
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:30,887
From now on, it's up to you guys.

797
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,099
There's nothing special
about our generation.

798
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:37,351
We're fallible like everybody.

799
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:17,642
Let's move 'em out! Move, move!

800
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:20,227
Come on! Move out!

801
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:50,508
All units now coming out, sir.

802
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,936
Godzilla has reached Wakasa Bay!
Godzilla approaching--

803
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,147
The clouds appeared as expected.
Now they have to be charged.

804
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,149
Good.

805
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:50,067
TC System, standby.

806
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:45,122
Godzilla is entering the TC field, sir.

807
01:24:45,206 --> 01:24:46,582
Good.

808
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:09,105
See that? That must have raised
his temperature a little.

809
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:10,898
How hot is that thing?

810
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:13,025
So hot it can melt
an A1 tank easily.

811
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,820
- It's gone outside the TC field.
- Keep it in.

812
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:17,404
- It mustn't escape.
- Yes, sir!

813
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:19,406
Commence firing!

814
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:48,769
- It's back in the field now, sir.
- Good.

815
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:50,729
C4.

816
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,326
- Doctor?
- First line destroyed.

817
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,412
Lines two and three,
stand by to take offensive action.

818
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,039
We'd better start hoping
this idea is going to work.

819
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:12,168
If we can get his temperature high enough,
the bacteria should work.

820
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,711
At least I hope so.

821
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:26,182
- Kuroki?
- What's happening?

822
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,559
Call Takahama, the atomic plant.

823
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:29,685
Yes, sir!

824
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:33,189
Takahama plant?
This is an emergency.

825
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:34,690
What are you two doing here?
It's dangerous?

826
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:37,193
Biollante is still alive.
You ask Miki.

827
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,527
- What?
- Look at this.

828
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:42,198
Chopper force, maintain position.
Kamatsu Bay, stand by to scramble.

829
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,961
It's working!
The bacteria is spreading.

830
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:58,130
It looks good.

831
01:26:58,214 --> 01:26:59,715
Helicopters move in.

832
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:15,666
My God, it's incredible.

833
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:17,459
Line three, move in.

834
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:19,837
Could Godzilla be immune
to the bacteria?

835
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,630
It isn't possible.

836
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:26,093
The Takahama plant is on red alert.

837
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:07,426
Miki!

838
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,096
Hey, where are you going?

839
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,101
- Where is she going?
- I have no idea. <i>I'll</i> see.

840
01:29:16,185 --> 01:29:18,354
It's dangerous. Come back.

841
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:55,557
- What the hell is going on?
- Some kind of jamming signal!

842
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,602
Biollante.

843
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,882
Biollante, she--

844
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,967
she's evolving.

845
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:14,900
What's going on?

846
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,600
Look at Godzilla.

847
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,413
Look, the bacteria has taken effect.

848
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:17,337
Dr. Shiragami? Congratulations.

849
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:21,174
One day, we're going to put all of this
to good use.

850
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:23,385
We have to isolate samples
of the gene

851
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,179
and put them into production at once.

852
01:35:30,559 --> 01:35:33,395
I won't continue my work
on bacteria anymore.

853
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,939
Biollante has convinced me of that.

854
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:38,191
What is the matter?

855
01:35:38,275 --> 01:35:41,528
You have to continue
with your work, Doctor.

856
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:44,614
You've got all the cells
you'll ever need.

857
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,451
Godzilla and Biollante aren't monsters.

858
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:51,288
It's the unscrupulous scientists
who create them who are monsters.

859
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:56,126
Biollante!

860
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:50,680
She says thank you.

861
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:52,224
Eh?

862
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:56,102
Biollante said it.

863
01:36:58,021 --> 01:36:59,815
Erika.

864
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:07,989
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

865
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,124
It's him!

866
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:22,582
You were wonderful, Superman.

867
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:25,293
How's the doctor?

868
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:36,429
The water must have had an effect
on his temperature.

869
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:06,167
Godzilla's gone back to the sea,

870
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:08,795
Biollante to the sky.

871
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:11,715
And this lucky couple's
going to America.

872
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,802
A nice thought,
but I've canceled America.

873
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,262
Why's that?

874
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:20,098
'Cause wherever you go,
people are the same.

875
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:22,851
There's good and there's bad
in every country.

876
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:25,395
Then where will you go?

877
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:28,732
Well, first of all...

878
01:40:28,815 --> 01:40:32,444
to bed, I should think.
I haven't slept in ages.

879
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,529
Got room for me?

880
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,614
Do you snore?

881
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,616
Nonstop.

882
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:39,427
How long
have we been living in such an age?

883
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:44,849
Maybe it started

884
01:41:44,933 --> 01:41:48,686
when man first stepped
out of the Garden of Eden

885
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:51,689
and left his innocence behind.

886
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:56,152
Man would do well
to remember this day forever.
