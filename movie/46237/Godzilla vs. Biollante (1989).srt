1
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,410
First Alarm System: In case of
chemical, geological, meteorological...

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,350
... or other than a physical sign
of G's action is confirmed.

3
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,950
Second Alarm System: In case any physical sign of
G's action, such as voice and motion, is confirmed.

4
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,330
Third Alarm System:
In case G appears.

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,340
Fourth Alarm System: In case of G's
landing on any specific coast of Japan.

"Godzilla vs. Biollante"
(Gojira tai Biorante)

7
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,770
I've found something!

8
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,780
Who's there?
This area is off-limits!

9
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,340
REPUBLIC OF SARADIA

10
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,170
Where are you going at
this time of night?

11
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,700
I have to go to the lab.

12
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,610
I just received a call saying that
the Godzilla cells have arrived.

13
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,780
They must be quick-frozen.
I'll be back for dinner.

14
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,790
You didn't have to come with me, Erica.

15
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,560
Dad, it's okay. You know you
can't do anything without me.

16
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,460
SARADIA INSTITUTE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY

17
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,860
See you later, Dad.
I'll meet you in the lab.

18
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,520
Erica!

19
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,870
Miki Saegusa, age 17...

20
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,900
She is the best psychic we have at the
Mental Science Exploration Center.

21
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
It has been shown
through numerous tests...

22
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,410
... that plants have their own
fields of mental energy.

23
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,780
It comes as no surprise, that
we've finally found someone...

24
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,010
FIVE YEARS LATER

25
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,780
... who can communicate with them.

26
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,520
Tell me doctor, why do you suddenly
wish to hear the voice of a rose?

27
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,400
I guess it's a sign of old age.

28
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,290
I've lived here alone for
over five years now.

29
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,630
I guess solitude has given
me some strange ideas.

30
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,940
Has it really been five years?

31
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Erica said that one day, the desert would come
to life, carpeted with all kinds of wild flowers.

32
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,620
How is your father, Asuku?

33
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,760
He's fine.

34
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,700
His latest project is to start a bio-bank.
He's trying to get the Foundation to fund it.

35
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes, I've heard of your father's
project and how he wants to...

36
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,730
...preserve the sperm of Nobel Prize winners
for the production of future geniuses.

37
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,070
There's been a lot of opposition to
his project, but it's still going ahead.

38
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,940
It won't be easy to get
his work accepted.

39
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,720
You see, those same kinds of attitudes
forced me to leave the country.

40
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,350
Some things haven't
changed in five years.

41
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,880
How did you do?

42
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,890
It wasn't any good.
I got nothing.

43
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,480
We'll see you later.

44
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,230
Thanks for stopping by.

45
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,000
Did you hear something just now?

46
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,970
A girl was calling you, Asuka.
It was your name, I'm sure of it.

47
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,940
Goodbye...

48
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,020
Have you ever heard of a chimera?

49
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,460
Chimera?

50
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,760
It's a legendary monster
that breathes fire.

51
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,530
It's supposed to appear from the ocean's depths,
causing storms and destroying human beings.

52
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,900
It has a lion's head, a goat's
body, and a dragon's tail.

53
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,540
But wasn't it a mythical creature?

54
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,170
If genetic engineers keep playing with cells,
they may create their very own chimera.

55
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,250
A new like form, totally alien, and completely
different from what God intended for earth.

56
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,620
Frightening, huh?

57
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,290
I understand how you feel about my father's
work and many people are against it as well.

58
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,230
But I can't help it if my father is the
head of the Ecology Foundation.

59
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,770
I don't see how our relationship
has anything to do with it.

60
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,710
You're right, but I'm still
uneasy about my work.

61
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,830
After all, the Foundation
supports the labs.

62
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,780
Yes, but that doesn't
affect our being together.

63
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,080
You act like Romeo,
from Shakespeare's play.

64
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,850
Well, you won't catch me
portraying your Juliet...

65
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,720
Massachusetts sent me an answer.
They want me to study there.

66
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,670
Asuka, will you come with me?

67
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,020
I don't know what to say...
I can't give you an answer now.

68
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,860
Last night, a series of violent tremors has shaken
the area around Mt. Mihara, on Oshima Island.

69
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,230
Early this morning, smoke has
been seen rising from the crater.

70
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,430
The Central Seismic Bureau is
monitoring the situation...

71
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,040
But at this stage, they are
unsure if a full eruption is likely.

72
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,850
I first heard it from two
children a few days ago.

73
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,520
Now, they all say they had the
same dream last night.

74
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,720
Did you?

75
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,230
It started a week ago, and every night
since then, it has become more clear.

76
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,400
Well, have you finished?

77
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,970
Yes!

78
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,010
Well then, show us what
you've dreamed about!

79
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,540
Yes!

This is Gondo...

83
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,620
It's you, Colonel!

84
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,560
Yes, it's really exciting to wait
for a lizard that never shows up!

85
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,400
You must be joking, Colonel!

86
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,670
They must be trying
to replace me!

87
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,140
The most exciting thing that happens around
here, is betting on who kills the most mosquitoes!

88
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,650
Sure! God only knows why I
accepted this assignment.

89
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,750
By the way...

90
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,720
I called you because I wanted to conduct some
research, and for that I'll need your cooperation.

91
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,890
I understand,
tomorrow at 10:30.

92
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,750

PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE

96
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,410
I don't think the Prime
Minister believes her story.

97
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,510
No, of course not.
She's just a nobody.

98
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,980
If he started believing girls
talking about dreams and ESP...

99
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,980
...he wouldn't be Prime
Minister for too long.

100
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,480
So Gondo, do you believe
what she's saying?

101
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,120
The truth is,
I hope it shows up...

102
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,790
If it doesn't,
I'll be out of a job...

All of the latest gadgets
are at our disposal...

107
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,010
...including ESP.

108
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,750
The army is really up to date.

109
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,350
Aren't they?

110
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,820
You've forgotten one thing.

111
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,890
What's that?

112
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,820
You didn't mention
our bio-weapons.

113
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,790
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria?

114
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,130
TSUKUBA LABORATORY
OF BIOTECHNOLOGY

115
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,700
Already in the United States...

116
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,700
... they've created a bacteria
that can eat crude oil.

117
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,470
It's been successfully
tested on the oil spills.

118
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,740
Likewise...

119
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,010
...bacteria that can eat nuclear material
has been developed by our scientists here.

120
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,250
In case of a nuclear accident...

121
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,880
...the bacteria would clean
up any radioactive pollution.

122
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,850
It eats... nuclear material?

123
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,390
Of course, and that's why it would work against
Godzilla, who feeds upon nuclear energy.

124
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,130
Well, the situation
isn't critical, yet.

125
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,860
True, an orange alert has been issued
and the bacteria must be readied...

126
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,070
But the bacteria wasn't meant
to be used as a weapon.

127
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,540
Not yet...

128
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,710
Well, the problem is that the bacteria can't
be produced in this laboratory on its own...

129
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,310
We need a Godzilla
cell to create it.

130
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,100
A Godzilla cell?

131
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,180
Godzilla feeds on nuclear energy...

132
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,850
Somewhere in its cell structure, lies
a nuclear-digesting set of genes.

133
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,190
We need that set of genes
to make the bacteria.

134
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,860
So, you're saying that...

135
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,530
...something taken from Godzilla's cells, can
be made into something that can destroy it?

136
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,260
The Godzilla cells were found five years ago.
They were collected by an army special unit.

137
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,270
They're stored at
the Okochi Foundation.

138
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,140
Will you need anything else, Doctor?

139
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,710
Just a few scientists...

140
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen, but I
vowed never to work with Godzilla cells again.

141
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,290
I understand how you
must feel, Doctor...

142
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,920
...but it's vital for the defense
of our country against Godzilla.

143
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,540
My daughter was more important
to me than my country.

144
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,370
I lost her because of my
work with Godzilla cells.

145
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,870
Now, I have nothing left to live for.

146
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,510
Thank you, but I must refuse.

147
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,190
OKOCHI FOUNDATION

148
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,790
So, you're Dr. Kirishima?
My daughter has told me a lot about you.

149
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,150
I'm glad that we could finally meet.

150
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,700
My daughter also told me that you're
a little critical about our work here.

151
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,100
Extremely...

152
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,870
Well, at least you're honest.

153
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,610
However, I feel that you, like the other
scientists, don't know what I'm doing here.

154
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,480
I do realize the dangers involved,
after all, every coin has two sides...

155
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,350
In that case, you must realize
what kind of weapon the...

156
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,520
...Anti-Nuclear Bacteria would be.
Are you aware of it?

157
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,360
I know that it could neutralize
nuclear missiles.

158
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,130
Nuclear weapons would be
rendered useless overnight.

159
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,730
If we create that bacteria,
the balance of power...

160
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,200
Kirishima, reality is reality.

161
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,410
This Foundation now has the
technology to make that bacteria.

162
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,390
The superpowers of the world would do
anything to get hold of the Godzilla cells.

163
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,780
If any country succeeded, I'd have
to use force to recover the cells.

164
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,120
The same way the
American Bio-Major...

165
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,660
...attacked and destroyed
Shiragami's lab, 5 years ago.

166
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,420
The government decided to store the Godzilla
cells here in this vault as a precaution.

167
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,270
They would remain in here
and only be used...

168
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,640
...in case of a nuclear emergency
that would threaten the country.

169
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,370
And only under strict control!
But then, Godzilla came along...

170
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,340
...and the rest is history.

171
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,080
As for myself, I hate the idea
of the cells being locked up.

172
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,730
These are the Godzilla cells?

173
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,200
Japan was devastated by nuclear
bombs, and we now have Godzilla...

174
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,140
It's only fair that we use it as a weapon,
that will protect us from our enemies.

175
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,280
An earthquake?

176
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,930
A powerful eruption occurred at Mt. Mihara,
on Oshima Island, a short time ago...

177
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,130
It caused a series of tremors that
were felt throughout the Kanto region.

178
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,740
The eruptions are still occurring...

179
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,280
... throwing lava high into the night sky
and giving the scene an eerie glow...

180
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,090
I must do something,
or Erica will die!

181
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,960
I see...

182
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,310
Dr. Shiragami, welcome to the team!

183
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,340
Thank you.

184
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,780
Shiragami has accepted the position?

185
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,220
Really? He's coming here tomorrow?

186
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,120
What?

187
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,020
Yes, on one condition. He wants
to keep the Godzilla cells...

188
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,690
...in his lab for seven days.
Of course, I told him it was okay.

189
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,330
So, what are you going to be doing?

190
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,100
Will you be creating the
bacteria with Dr. Shiragami?

191
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,440
Yes, to destroy Godzilla
when it returns.

192
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,740
It sounds as if you want
Godzilla to show up.

193
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,880
Maybe, but who knows if
Godzilla will ever appear again...

194
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,950
What if we create the bacteria,
and it's just a false alarm?

195
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,760
I'd be happy if I never
saw Godzilla again!

196
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,230
I'm not joking. We would have created
something as terrible as Godzilla.

197
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,600
I know that it's just a simple bacteria
we're creating via genetic engineering...

198
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,450
But, if the research continues
at its present course...

199
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,840
...genetic technology will produce
something far worse than Godzilla!

200
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,720
Kirishima...

201
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:49,830
If we don't produce this bacteria,
someone else is sure to do it!

202
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,330
Just look at what humans have done
in the past centuries and you'll see.

203
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,670
I know that!
But our responsibility...

204
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,500
Kirishima, I don't believe you
understand science very well.

205
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,740
You can see there's not a lot of movement,
but something is happening down there!

206
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,210
Second Alarm System: In case any physical sign of
G's action, such as voice and motion is confirmed.

207
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,060
The Super-X2 has been substantially
improved with the installation of...

208
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,500
... the latest on-board supercomputer, that
controls automatic and remote functions.

209
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:12,640
It's also submersible, capable of operating
at such extreme depths as 10,000 meters.

210
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,980
Its armor is also the latest, TA-32.

211
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,120
It's twice as durable as the
titanium-alloy on the Super-X.

212
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,990
Right. This way, please.

213
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,540
That is called the Fire-Mirror.

214
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,010
It was completely constructed
with synthetic diamonds.

215
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,220
If the mirror is hit with
Godzilla's radioactive breath...

216
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,190
...it will return its
attack a thousand-fold.

217
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,520
Pretty powerful!

218
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,980
Yes, it is.

219
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,230
It's already started.

220
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,900
I've always been fascinated
with cell division.

221
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,770
Two cells in 30 minutes, doubling to
4 in an hour... 32 cells in two hours.

222
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,910
In one day, 4 million cells.

223
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,110
Terrifying, isn't it?

224
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,810
This is Kirishima...

225
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,550
What?! Dr. Shiragami's lab?!

226
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,750
The bodies belong to two
of Bio-Major's agents.

227
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,790
They broke in to steal the
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria data.

228
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,630
God only knows how they died...

229
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,280
Is this why you've been keeping the
Godzilla cells in your lab all this week?

230
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,080
During the experiment, I thought I
created an immortal plant species.

231
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,820
I gave it self-reproducing
abilities using Godzilla cells.

232
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,590
You did what?!

233
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,900
I thought...
I think I may have made a mistake.

234
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,090
"And demand that you turn over all
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria data..."

235
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,660
"...to us no later than 2:00,
on Tuesday the 31st..."

236
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,930
"...or we will cause an explosion on Mt. Mihara
that will destroy it completely and free Godzilla."

237
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,530
It was faxed to us.
We received it this morning.

238
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,940
The name of the
organization is "ALIEN"?

239
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,940
Unbelievable...
It's Bio-Major!

240
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,680
They're the only ones who would know
about the Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria.

241
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,080
Yeah, it's a bluff.

242
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,820
The Prime Minister?

243
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,390
He's been too busy and more worried
about the opposition parties than Godzilla.

244
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,590
Well, they're not bluffing.

245
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,370
That was a call from Mt. Mihara. There was
an explosion, but it was just a warning.

246
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,210
A warning?

247
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,200
Read the rest, you'll understand.

248
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,570
There's more to the message.

249
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,450
"We've already made preparations
to prove that we mean business..."

250
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,580
"We shall set off a warning explosion by remote
control at 2:00, 24 hours before the deadline."

251
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,350
They're holding the entire
country for ransom!

252
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,600
And Godzilla is their hostage...

253
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,570
Slow down...
This looks like the place.

254
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,280
Deliver the bacteria to Bio-Major?

255
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,920
I understand...

256
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,760
If that's what the
government has decided...

257
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,060
Whatever you say, sir.

258
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,700
Doctor...

259
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,010
You see? Science is just
another host for politicians.

260
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,270
So you're going to leave it to them?

261
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,840
We can't just sit here
and do nothing!

262
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,650
Dr. Shiragami!

263
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,520
Come to the lake!

264
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,500
I don't believe it!

265
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,040
What you see is no ordinary plant.

266
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,010
That is Biollante.

267
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,910
Biollante?

268
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,420
The spirit of a plant that
appears in Norse mythology.

269
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,390
But that plant, has a human spirit.

270
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,490
A human spirit?

271
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,760
Doctor, I believe Erica's
spirit is in there!

272
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,070
How do you know?

273
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,700
I can hear her calling me.

274
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,640
Asuka, I'll need your help.

275
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,610
You did it. You spliced one
of Godzilla's cells...

276
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,520
...with one of the plant's cells.

277
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,550
Are you proud of this?

278
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,330
What kind of science
do you call it?!

279
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,480
What was he doing?

280
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,170
He was crazy to start playing
with the Godzilla cells.

281
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,150
I don't know what scientists
are trying to do nowadays.

282
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,450
It's way beyond me.

283
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,070
You have it?

284
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,280
You'd better get moving, 'ALIEN".

285
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,690
The switch is in the container.

286
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,350
So, it's a double-cross?!

287
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,460
You damned idiot!
We've got to throw the switch!

288
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,860
There's no time left!

289
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,570
Saradia?

290
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,380
We've got to get this open!

291
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,830
I know! The key!

292
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,030
He got away with the bacteria!

293
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,040
Forget it!
The switch is broken!

294
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,410
Amen!

295
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,770
Third Alarm System:
In case G appears.

296
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,240
Godzilla is back again...

297
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,200
And we lose the
anti-nuclear energy bacteria.

298
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,080
I guess things are about
as bad as they can get.

299
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,340
Well, you miserable people of Tokyo...

300
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,120
I'm glad you tuned in,
because this show has...

301
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,790
We have a special report,
please stay tuned.

302
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,730
In the United States, new laws were...
Just a moment...

303
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,560
This just in... An explosion has occurred on Mt.
Mihara. Godzilla has escaped and is still at large.

304
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,340
So, Godzilla is back again?

305
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,910
Doctor, we must return to Tokyo!

306
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,880
Biollante is crying,
I can hear her.

307
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,520
The Coast Guard in the
Tokyo Bay area...

308
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,290
... is warning the residents in Godzilla's
path and is evacuating the area.

309
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,700
We have just received these pictures.
Godzilla is slowly on the move.

310
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,470
It has left Oshima Island and is
heading in the direction of Tokyo.

311
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,240
OPERATIONS CENTER
SELF-DEFENSE AGENCY

312
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,410
At this rate, Godzilla will reach
Tokyo in 24 hours.

313
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,450
Super-X2, proceed
to runway. Confirmed.

314
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,250
Super-X2, proceed to runway.

315
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,660
Colonel Kuruki reporting for duty, sir!

316
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:41,430
Super-X2 was assigned to me in
our operation against Godzilla.

317
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,110
I see you're from a
new youth-elite corp.

318
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,570
Yes, sir!

319
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,720
All on-board systems showing
normal speed, Mach 1.

320
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,190
It will be arriving
in ten minutes.

321
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,490
Switch to the X2 cameras.

322
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,390
Roger.

323
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,570
Activate the Fire-Mirrors.
Home in on the sensors.

324
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,140
Fire-Mirrors set, on.

325
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,100
Godzilla is turning west!

326
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,610
Colonel Kuruki, a
phone call for you.

327
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,050
Yes, this is Kuruki.
Oh, it's you Gondo.

328
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,390
What?! They stole the
anti-nuclear bacteria?!

329
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,560
Close all the airports?
I understand. Alright.

330
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,330
I recommend waiting before
giving the all-clear.

331
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,340
Inform the press that we're still
fighting Godzilla in the Yuraga Channel.

332
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,830
Kuruki, are you suggesting
that we should lie?

333
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:20,090
Your attention please. The airport is closing
down due to the advance of Godzilla.

334
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,530
This just in... Godzilla has stopped its
advance between Yabura and Tachiyama.

335
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,730
Haneda and Narita airports
are closed until further notice.

336
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,020
The agent's car has been spotted!
He's on the Tomei highway, heading west!

337
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,380
Tomei?

338
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,660
Where could he be going?

339
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:07,600
Saradia Oil Corporation, based in Osaka,
run by a former secret-agent of theirs.

340
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,510
It's a front for their
spying activities.

341
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,750
Every week, a freighter in
Kobe leaves for Saradia.

342
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,220
So you think they'll
smuggle it out by sea?

343
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,860
If we could retrieve the bacteria,
we can defeat Godzilla.

344
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:31,850
Then, we'll have an almost
endless supply of Godzilla cells.

345
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:36,600
I see, but Dr. Shiragami is...

346
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,630
Dr. Shiragami...

347
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,810
Excuse me, I'm from TNN TV.

348
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,380
I'd like to talk
to you for a moment.

349
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,020
I've heard that your experiment successfully
combined the cells of a plant with Godzilla cells...

350
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,350
...to create a super-plant.
Dr. Shiragami!

351
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,060
You people always criticize scientific experiments
without understanding their true value.

352
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,120
Scientists must look toward the future!

353
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,680
It's no longer Erica's
spirit, Doctor.

354
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:24,320
I can't read it anymore.
I'm shut out.

355
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,340
Then Biollante is...

356
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,450
Biollante is just a cross
between a plant and Godzilla.

357
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,790
What is it?

358
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,550
Godzilla?

359
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,860
Godzilla! Biollante is
calling for Godzilla!

360
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,010
Godzilla is turning north toward
Adowara. What shall I do, sir?

361
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,480
Keep it in the water,
away from the coast.

362
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,650
Understood...
Begin underwater attack.

363
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,630
The mirror's reflection
rate has dropped to 40%.

364
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,140
The Fire-Mirror is melting!

365
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,310
We can't control the
lasers as well!

366
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,580
Incredible!

367
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,980
The mirror is heat-proof,
but not like the TA-32 armor.

368
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,850
Switching to missile attack.

369
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,700
It's out of control!

370
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,870
I think Super X-2 is out of action.

371
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,800
Can you bring it home?

372
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,680
I'll try my best.

373
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,450
Godzilla has finally
landed on the east coast...

374
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,220
... and is heading toward Lake Hashi.

375
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,120
Repeating, Godzilla has landed on the
coast and is heading toward Lake Hashi.

376
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:18,250
The 31st and 34th regiments have
arrived at the southern end of the lake...

377
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,320
They are taking up
defensive positions.

378
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,440
Doctor!

379
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,410
Get inside, it's too
dangerous out here!

380
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,340
Miki, hurry! Doctor!

381
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,810
What's going on?

382
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,830
Our opponent thinks it
will win easily.

383
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,420
I wonder...

384
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:12,300
Did Godzilla come to see Biollante because it
knew they were made from the same cells?

385
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,330
Yes, it's possible...

386
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,570
They're both from the same family.

387
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,270
More than just the same family...

388
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,480
They're both made from
the same cells.

389
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:27,080
They're identical, two of a kind. Not brother
and sister, they're the same creature.

390
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,140
Biollante is dying!

391
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,780
Godzilla's attack must have had an
abnormal effect on Biollante's cell division.

392
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:58,290
I guess it's not
immortal after all.

393
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,540
Godzilla is in Sagami Bay?

394
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,600
So, it's out to sea?

395
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,880
Yes, we're trying to fix it.

396
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,070
Sure... Right.

397
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,480
Well?

398
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,650
The computers tested out okay.

399
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,120
The remote control needs to be
replaced, but that's expected.

400
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:29,360
However, the Fire-Mirror
is out of action.

401
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,780
Can't you fix it?

402
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,950
It's badly deformed in
too many areas.

403
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:38,590
Godzilla's melted a mirror of synthetic diamond!
That's beyond our technological limits!

404
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,680
This is Chopper Three,
no signal on radar or sonar.

405
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,400
This is Chopper One,
Godzilla is nowhere to be found.

406
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,780
Roger... All units standby.

407
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,580
I want another sweep of Saraga
Bay and the surrounding area.

408
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,840
Understood.

409
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,450
If we lose Godzilla this time,
we won't have another chance.

410
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,590
We are currently over the sea...

411
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:06,630
We will continue to search the bay and
coastal areas for as long as possible.

412
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,590
Roger...

413
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:11,630
Continue your search pattern
at reference point 4-2-0-9-6-4.

414
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,950
Doctor...

415
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,890
Miss Okochi, Colonel Kuruki
wants you on the phone.

416
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,860
Is it possible that Miki can detect Godzilla
under water the way she did at the volcano?

417
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:48,030
I'm low on fuel. If we go any further,
we won't make it back to Tokyo.

418
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,170
A little further, please.

419
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,740
Okay, we'll head for Osaka.

420
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,970
Okay.

421
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,380
It's here, below us!
It's moving slowly.

422
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:08,390
Godzilla is heading west,
100 kilometers off Hamamatsu.

423
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:11,760
The last time Godzilla attacked,
it ate a lot of nuclear material...

424
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,900
...from an atomic plant
to store energy.

425
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,690
This time it doesn't have a
supply of nuclear material...

426
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:23,640
...and its battles with X2 and
Biollante used up a lot of its energy.

427
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,600
Do you think it will head
for an atomic plant?

428
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,810
What plants are nearest to it?

429
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:39,180
One at Maizuru, one at Obana,
and three at Tsuruga.

430
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,490
That makes five total, a third
of all the plants in Japan.

431
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,860
If Godzilla went that way...

432
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,900
It would be a disaster if even
one of those plants is destroyed!

433
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,670
Judging by Godzilla's latest position,
the nearest one would be here.

434
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:55,970
Nagoya!

435
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,980
We must organize our defenses.
Send a message...

436
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,010
I want Super-X2 sent into the bay.

437
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:06,850
I want air cover at all times, and ground
troops on the three peninsulas around the bay.

438
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:11,850
Here, is where we'll launch
our attack against Godzilla.

439
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,560
An all-out attack at Ise Bay?

440
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,430
Godzilla is just as likely to
come from Wakasa Bay.

441
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,170
What if they send everyone
in and it doesn't show?

442
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:05,400
It's an interesting question,
but an important one.

443
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,660
Godzilla has surfaced!

444
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,280
It's heading for Osaka!

445
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,290
Send Super-X2 after it.

446
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:28,190
Understood.

447
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,700
Send the fleet to the
channel for battle.

448
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:30,860
Understood!

449
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,970
We must close the expressway
and send all troops to Osaka.

450
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:36,700
It's too late.
There's no time for that.

451
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,040
I know it's too late,
but what else can we do?!

452
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:41,910
We must move all troops along
the Mishimi expressway...

453
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,170
...to prepare for a counterattack
in Wakasa against Godzilla.

454
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,440
If we go to Osaka,
we won't have a chance...

455
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,550
But, if we go to Wakasa,
we might be able to beat it.

456
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:50,920
What happens to Osaka?!

457
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,290
My mission is to defeat Godzilla!

458
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,890
Its advance on Osaka
must be delayed.

459
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:58,260
You'll have to evacuate Osaka.

460
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,300
Contact Miss Okochi in Osaka.

461
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,560
Yes, sir!

462
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,430
KANSAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
CONSTRUCTION BASE

463
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:50,650
Miki!

464
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,620
Leave here, please!

465
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,220
It's too dangerous!
Please do as I ask!

466
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:00,260
We were ordered to
stay with you!

467
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,980
I insist!
Hurry and get away!

468
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,060
What is this, telepathy?
It's all in her mind!

469
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,460
It's absurd to think she
can defeat Godzilla!

470
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,800
This girl has been a
great help to us.

471
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:48,100
She might be able to delay
Godzilla's landing in Osaka!

472
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,370
I trust her ESP ability.

473
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:09,950
Miki!

474
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,970
The Navy has made it
to the channel.

475
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:46,380
They'll never make it. It's too close to
Osaka for them to use their cannons.

476
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:52,590
Fourth Alarm System: In case G's
landing on any specific coast of Japan.

477
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,160
Ladies and Gentlemen, we must cancel the concert
due to an emergency. Godzilla is approaching Osaka!

478
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:26,560
Please follow the Marshall�s
instruction and evacuate the building!

479
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:33,870
Godzilla is expected to arrive
in Osaka from Osaka Bay.

480
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:41,400
All civilians are required to evacuate in accordance
with the instructions they receive on radio and TV.

481
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:45,680
Evacuate calmly and do not panic.

482
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:47,750
Repeating...

483
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:52,520
Godzilla is expected to arrive
in Osaka from Osaka Bay.

484
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:56,960
All civilians are required to evacuate in accordance
with the instructions they receive on radio and TV.

485
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,610
Is anyone here?

486
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,490
What do you want?

487
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,720
We're criminals...

488
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:32,060
Yeah, we're robbing this place.

489
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,230
And you...

490
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:59,990
There's only one way to
deal with his kind.

491
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,580
Run!

492
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,860
Godzilla is passing the north side of Osaka park.
It's heading for the business district!

493
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,360
Colonel Gondo has just left with a loaded
ANB Rocket Gun. He's on his way, sir.

494
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:22,500
Good...

495
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,560
SuperX-2?

496
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,500
It's waiting at the
business district.

497
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,700
Let's go!

498
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,010
Let's go!

499
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,910
Right!

500
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,340
Attack Godzilla from the front. Try to lure
it over to the tall building on its right.

501
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:50,850
Can you do that without
using the Fire-Mirror?

502
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:54,950
Ready missiles and Gatling-guns!
I'll do my best...

503
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,700
Good! Keep it going!

504
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,540
We're out of missiles!

505
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,840
Colonel Gondo and his bazooka
troop are in position!

506
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,340
A little more...

507
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,240
Ready the Fire-Mirror.

508
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,780
What did you say?

509
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,290
The Fire-Mirror isn't
functioning properly!

510
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,480
Godzilla's not in
the proper position yet!

511
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,420
Fire!

512
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:00,100
We did it!

513
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,000
Okay, pull out!

514
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:26,160
Come in, Colonel! Colonel Gondo!
Godzilla is approaching your position!

515
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,790
Repeat, Godzilla is approaching
your position! Come in, colonel!

516
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,280
All of this intravenous
stuff is bad for you, Godzilla!

517
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:55,550
Gondo!

518
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,880
After landing in Osaka and
devastating the city...

519
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:31,260
... Godzilla has moved north to
the Tappa mountains.

520
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:37,430
She used as much energy as Godzilla.
It's no wonder why she's exhausted.

521
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,170
She shouldn't have done it.
She could have died...

522
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:48,340
Yes?

523
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:51,410
It's a call for Mr. Kirishima.

524
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,850
Thanks.

525
01:17:58,620 --> 01:17:59,920
Oh, Kuruki...

526
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,960
Right... Right...

527
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:06,160
It's been over fourteen hours now...

528
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,800
There still doesn't seem to be
any change in Godzilla yet.

529
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,200
If the bacteria doesn't work in the
next eight hours, we've had it.

530
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,670
Is that right? I understand...
I'll get a chopper and see you in Tokyo.

531
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,650
The Anti-Nuclear Bacteria should take
effect within six to twelve hours.

532
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,410
On the average, it's only eight hours.
I don't understand why nothing's happened yet.

533
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:31,010
Maybe Godzilla is too large
for the dose we gave it.

534
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,590
No, one should have been enough,
and Godzilla got three.

535
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,890
One of them was fired in its mouth!
The dose was lethal...

536
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,050
I don't understand it.

537
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,990
Neither do I...

538
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:48,500
Ice blocks...?
The refrigeration is off.

539
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:51,240
When Godzilla attacked yesterday,
it destroyed the power plant.

540
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,410
The hospital's generators
couldn't handle it.

541
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,750
What's wrong?

542
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,140
I wonder...

543
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,190
Godzilla's temperature?

544
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,280
Yes, I think it has a
low body temperature.

545
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:09,990
Is that important?

546
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:14,830
We have no data concerning Godzilla's
body temperature, so we don't know.

547
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,290
But, why?

548
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:23,130
Bacteria breeds slower in low temperatures, so the
lower the temperature, the slower the reaction.

549
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:29,580
You mean the bacteria won't work
because it's a cold-blooded creature?

550
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:30,870
Yes, it's possible.

551
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,180
So, if we can raise
Godzilla's temperature...

552
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,180
Yes, but how...?

553
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,790
The M-6000 TC system.

554
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,860
Kuruki!

555
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,490
TC system?

556
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,630
Thunder-control system.
It creates artificial thunder...

557
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,920
...causing high frequency waves
to create clouds, then heat.

558
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:50,030
Like a giant microwave oven!

559
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,690
Kuruki, we can't use that system
since it's still in its research stage!

560
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:04,750
Tower One to base. Silver-Iodine
seeding is completed.

561
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,150
Expect clouds in two hours.

562
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:17,260
The ground troops are nearly in position!

563
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,130
Go!

564
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,430
B- 4 installation, ready!

565
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,110
B- 8 installation, ready!

566
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:38,200
F- 2 installation, ready!

567
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,220
Mobile war room...

568
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,620
... installation of all 100 generators
should be done within the hour.

569
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,120
It's hard to believe by
looking at his face...

570
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,290
... that he has such a huge
responsibility on his shoulders.

571
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:28,260
I guess it's time for my
generation to step down.

572
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,300
From now on, it's
up to you guys.

573
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,700
There's nothing special about our generation.
We make mistakes, just like everyone.

574
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,400
The generators have been completed.
Now, they have to be charged.

575
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,260
Good.

576
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:44,790
Godzilla is entering the TC field!

577
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,320
B-2!

578
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,820
You see? That must have raised
its temperature a little!

579
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,550
How hot is that?

580
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,660
So hot, it could melt
an A-1 tank easily!

581
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:14,690
It's gone outside the TC field!

582
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,450
Keep it in!
It must not escape!

583
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,690
Understood!
Commence firing!

584
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:47,960
It's back in the field now!

585
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:48,720
Good.

586
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:49,960
G- 4!

587
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,270
Doctor?

588
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,110
You better start hoping
this idea will work.

589
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:12,880
If we can get Godzilla's temperature
high enough, the bacteria should work.

590
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:26,130
Konaki, what should we do?

591
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:28,260
Contact Yohama, the nuclear plant.

592
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:29,700
Yes, sir!

593
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,640
What are you two doing here?!

594
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:36,640
Biollante is still alive! Ask Miki!

595
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:37,730
What?!

596
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:38,840
Godzilla!

597
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:55,790
It's working! The bacteria's spreading!

598
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,320
It's true!

599
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,360
Bring in the helicopters.

600
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,490
This is incredible!

601
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:19,440
Could Godzilla be immune
to the bacteria?

602
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,070
It isn't possible!

603
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:06,810
Miki!

604
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:10,830
Hey, where are you going?

605
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,290
Hey, where is she going?

606
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,130
I don't know! Come on!

607
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:17,860
It's dangerous! Stay here!

608
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,470
What's going on?

609
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:55,240
Something's jamming the system!

610
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:57,830
Biollante...

611
01:31:07,310 --> 01:31:11,140
Biollante...
She's evolving!

612
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,730
Biollante...

613
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:47,630
Look at Godzilla!

614
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:09,080
The bacteria has taken effect!

615
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:17,150
Congratulations, Dr. Shiragami!

616
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:20,260
One day, we'll put all of
this to good use.

617
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:25,400
Now we have to isolate samples of the
genes, and put them into production at once.

618
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:34,910
I'm not continuing my work on bacteria.
Biollante has convinced me of that.

619
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:37,270
What's the matter?

620
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,280
You must continue your work, doctor.

621
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,170
You've got all the Godzilla
cells you'll ever need!

622
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:50,860
Biollante and Godzilla aren't monsters, it's
the arrogant scientists that create them.

623
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,890
Biollante!

624
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:49,810
Thank you...

625
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,220
Biollante said it.

626
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,030
Erica!

627
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:07,000
Doctor!

628
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:17,470
It's him!

629
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:21,930
You look like Batman.

630
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:24,640
How is the doctor?

631
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,370
The water must have
lowered its temperature!

632
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:07,950
Godzilla's going back to the sea...
Biollante has gone to the sky.

633
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,020
And this lucky couple is
going to America!

634
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,580
Thanks, but I'm not going to America.

635
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:17,120
Why not?

636
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:19,980
Because wherever you go,
people are the same.

637
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:22,150
There's good and bad in every country.

638
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,000
Then, where will you go?

639
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,370
First...

640
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:31,160
...to bed, I think.
I haven't slept for days!

641
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:33,800
Shall we go together?

642
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:35,900
From here on?

643
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:38,070
Always!

644
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:40,600
How long have we been
living in such an age?

645
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:48,850
Maybe it started when man first stepped out of
the Garden of Eden, and left his innocence behind.

646
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:54,550
Man would do well to
remember this day, forever.
