5
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:42,568
You are novel, huh?

6
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,630
E ring tribunes?

7
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,057
Gives.

8
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
Live far away?

9
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:11,000
Tenth Legion! Forward!

10
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,899
So! Come on !

11
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,650
For 30 years, the Roman Empire of Tiberius Caesar's

12
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,674
Judean desert and led his people.

13
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,748
Baraba ! Baraba !

14
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,998
As prefect Pontius Pilate's tribune,

15
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,800
my job was to keep order in a city killed by the riots.

16
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:43,250
In formation!

17
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:48,600
Jews pray their only god, Yahweh, until the Messiah appeared a mystic.

18
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,424
Meanwhile, the Sanhedrin tries to maintain a precarious peace.

19
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:58,012
Every day there are new government zealous that defies Rome

20
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:02,600
to bring freedom. Instead, we bring death.

21
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,050
Kill them!

22
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,279
Positions! Take!

23
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,917
Formation!

24
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:30,196
Hold the line!

25
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,887
Forward!

26
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,429
Forward!

27
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,050
Tribunule !

28
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,650
I caught Barabbas!

29
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,519
Bring him here!

30
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,773
I know how it will end.

31
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:53,298
Then tell them that Yahweh live, courtesy of Mars.

32
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,350
You'll just find out that the only true god we chose us and not you.

33
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,350
But not today.

34
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,950
When the Messiah comes, Rome will not matter!

35
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,548
Until then...

36
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,450
Tribunule, has called Pilate!

37
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,882
- I'm dirty and bloody. - No matter, we have trouble.

38
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,900
Haide! Haide!

39
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,100
You won ?

40
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,400
They told me to hurry.

41
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,979
In reality, you're well-dressed for the job.

42
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:46,684
- What happened? - E Pesach! (Passover)

43
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:50,928
In all major holidays, fanatical idiots from Judea came to wreak havoc.

44
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,100
A madman has gathered a handful of followers defying doctrine.

45
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,350
Council decided to eliminate it.

46
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,000
He sent a handful of madmen who invokes his death

47
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:06,850
because he claims to be the Messiah.

48
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,350
We had to him crucified.

49
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,200
Do not look at me. They have made it and others.

50
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,250
The situation was risky, tribunule. You obviously can not understand.

51
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,650
King will arrive soon and expects to find order.

52
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,750
Order!

53
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,800
What you want me to do ?

54
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,800
Resume control of the territory and make orders.

55
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,950
This story has lasted too long.

56
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,450
And be merciful to one Nazarene.

57
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,450
Break his legs.

58
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,400
Clavius, he's your new aid.

59
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,000
Lucius Ticonius Enius. His father is my friend.

60
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,614
It's an honor for me, tribunule.

61
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,286
What's wrong with that? Now an hour the sun shone.

62
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
Poseidon s-a mâniat.

63
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,255
Sure some god was angry.

64
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,100
I hate when howling. I hate this.

65
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,500
It could take days.

66
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,100
Back!

67
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,600
Centurionule, how to proceed?

68
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,804
- It's a strange day, tribunule. - It was a small earthquake.

69
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,598
Not only that. It's too dark.

70
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,150
And King ... That's something wrong. Plebs feels.

71
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:52,550
Draw the sword and hit one.

72
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,500
Nazarene'm already dead.

73
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,750
After only six hours.

74
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,050
- It's not possible. - Spoke ?

75
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,000
- The man talked? - Just before the earthquake.

76
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,550
He said: "It is finished."

77
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,250
It's time to end this.

78
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,812
Finally.

79
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,643
Does not last long.

80
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,704
E mama nazarineanului.

81
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:52,175
You are!

82
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,558
Use spear.

83
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,950
That woman's mouth shut!

84
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,450
To shut up !

85
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
You are lucky or not.

86
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,166
This man was certainly innocent.

87
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,131
You must be strong.

88
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,849
Go and tell him that the prefect over.

89
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,110
Spread out! It's over !

90
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,756
Go to your homes!

91
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:03,603
Move! Out now! Out!

92
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,100
Bravo, free yourself! You must free yourself. Breathe deeply.

93
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,150
Breathe! So.

94
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,239
Come on, Let go!

95
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:04,245
Take claws!

96
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,850
I've never killed a king.

97
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,206
States !

98
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,720
Tribunule come from Pilate. Please read.

99
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:25,366
- You are Joseph of Arimathea? - I am.

100
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,400
Is your family tomb.

101
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,200
What is he to you?

102
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,650
Sabbath's close. I only have two hours.

103
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,600
Please.

104
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,348
It's yours.

105
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,600
Nicodemus, hurry!

106
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,750
Maria !

107
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:12,439
Out.

108
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,262
Sir?

109
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,269
Return to your centurion. Dealing them.

110
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Please tribunule.

111
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,450
Be careful! Take care !

112
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
Vino, Clavius, relaxeazã-te si tu.

113
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,000
Put them in a glass.

114
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,900
What do you want? Food, a massage, a girl?

115
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,800
- Only this. - You're young.

116
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,100
After a night of rest you can get it at the end.

117
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,350
Your services are appreciated, tribunule.

118
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,400
I'm counting on that.

119
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,762
So I ask forgiveness if I was a little dry today.

120
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:41,710
Does not matter.

121
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:43,841
Nazareth was closed?

122
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:49,700
I helped pushed the stone over the grave. It was enormous.

123
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,963
- There were many disciples. - Hopefully will be buried with him.

124
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:56,959
It's a strange case. I've never seen a death so desired.

125
00:16:56,961 --> 00:17:01,023
Even Him. As he will be sacrificed.

126
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,106
They're fanatics. Yahweh drives them crazy.

127
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,934
Yes, any other god.

128
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,300
For example, I just pray to Minerva.

129
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,850
For wisely. But you ?

130
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,450
- Mars. - It's normal.

131
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,000
Hopefully one of them listen to us.

132
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:24,598
We could use.

133
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,900
- Everyone does what you need. - Not loaded with yours.

134
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:34,500
Spare me. And you're stuck.

135
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,750
Your ambition was observed.

136
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,250
Where do you want to go ?

137
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,100
The Roma.

138
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,748
And?

139
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,010
- In a position of power. - What leads to ...

140
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,348
Welfare.

141
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,746
A beautiful family, a big house in the country.

142
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,902
Where did you find ...

143
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,750
End sacrifices.

144
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,000
A day without death.

145
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,600
Peace.

146
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,928
Yet for peace.

147
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,800
There is no other way?

148
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,463
Well, I go to sleep.

149
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:28,010
Tomorrow will be other punishments.

150
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,700
Nazareth ... did it seem different?

151
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:39,300
Mi death appeared.

152
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
Better.

153
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,459
- Pace, tribunule. Good night. - Good night.

154
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,200
A penny for the ferryman.

155
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,850
Good riddance to you, Gaius Elius.

156
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,677
Legion before!

157
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,577
Legion 10!

158
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,983
Tribunule, he called Pilate.

159
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,550
Ave, prefectule !

160
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,300
The smell of meat. Any celebration?

161
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,100
Funeral.

162
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,400
Here's the solution! Let it burn in public.

163
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,570
God forbids cremation.

164
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:32,798
It forbids you to work Saturdays and yet you are here

165
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,050
Tribunule.

166
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,450
- Who do you burn? - On Nazareth crucified.

167
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,029
What?

168
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,152
- It's unfinished business. - The man is dead, Caiaphas.

169
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:48,498
The disciples were hiding, no longer remains a threat to you.

170
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,850
But it remains a threat.

171
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,800
When live, the impostor said he would rise after three days.

172
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,800
He predicted that.

173
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,748
We demand that the tomb be sealed

174
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,600
that his disciples may not come at night to steal his body.

175
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,150
Not to say then that rose from the dead.

176
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,800
Would cause more chaos in the city that all blasphemies together.

177
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,450
- Have your guards. You can do it alone. - Are my words exactly.

178
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,850
To which I add that it takes Roman seal.

179
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,677
So that a decision may appear impartial prefect.

180
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,548
And not yours.

181
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,100
We want what he wants and Caesar.

182
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,700
Peace in Jerusalem, in Judea peace.

183
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,050
What you would lose if that body would disappear.

184
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,550
- This is why I'm here. - Take care of yourself.

185
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,050
Check you.

186
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,774
- Sigilati! - Sigilez.

187
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,250
None touch the seals before sunset tomorrow. It's clear ?

188
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,850
And Sacerdote say.

189
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,300
- But the centurion you? - Not good, not himself.

190
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:06,600
- That worries you? - No, tribunule, no way.

191
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,550
Only we have to be free tonight.

192
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,347
You will send rations.

193
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,805
And you are part of the council, huh?

194
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,198
Gives.

195
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
This man despise thy brethren, and you cry it.

196
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,800
It was very special.

197
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:42,846
A king?

198
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,606
Tribunule test me?

199
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,350
What was the name Nazarene?

200
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,843
His name was Jesus.

201
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,360
The or part!

202
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,588
A forgotten. And you know too.

203
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,815
If he had sent food, he had come before.

204
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,000
E de rang superior.

205
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:50,700
If you forget us, what we whips!

206
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,300
I kept for supper, but ...

207
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,850
- Great! You are great ! - Good !

208
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:13,050
I thought we broke even.

209
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,400
- Tribunule Pilate ... - he called.

210
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,850
A dispãrut !

211
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,443
Nazarineanul? Sigur nazarineanul!

212
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:53,262
- Tomb is empty! - Who broke the news? Garza?

213
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:56,198
Your guards are gone. We announced a local!

214
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,182
Who would you put the watch?

215
00:25:58,184 --> 00:26:00,998
I want them found and flogged to death, of course!

216
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,098
Let me do research.

217
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,550
I want results to come here before Caiaphas and his flock of Jews.

218
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:08,600
Too late.

219
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,100
Tribunule.

220
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,550
How about you not lie?

221
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,499
- They come to you? - To seek refuge.

222
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:23,150
I know the punishment for he who sleeps in service.

223
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,000
- What happened ? - Exactly what I predicted.

224
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,200
Heretic disciples came by night and stole the body.

225
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:33,431
They proclaimed already risen from the dead!

226
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:36,400
- People will think? - The weak, yes.

227
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,150
Others will want to do this, so you have to robbery.

228
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,493
You believe?

229
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:47,248
If they believe Garza will not be killed.

230
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,850
- It never ends! - Robbery.

231
00:26:49,852 --> 00:26:52,050
Prior to spread the news.

232
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,550
It's not enough !

233
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,400
Without a body to prove death, we have a potential Messiah.

234
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,838
I do not want to doubt, Tiberius must find no clutter!

235
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,548
We have to find a body definitely!

236
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,735
- Will you help me? - Of course, but you have to make the announcement.

237
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,561
My trust in you is moved, tribunule?

238
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:19,898
Maybe you prefer a place in hell.

239
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,017
You must find them all these disciples,

240
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,598
but especially to find the body of Jesus cursed!

241
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,509
Prior to rot.

242
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,023
Bring me the arimateean.

243
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:03,149
Come on, call your arimateean.

244
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,746
As if whipped!

245
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,800
Tribunule, look here!

246
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,690
- Where did he go? - That to tell me.

247
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,650
The body was embalmed?

248
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:13,694
I did not have time. I gave myrrh and aloe.

249
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,225
Here you see. Sweat and herbs. Get it!

250
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,238
Do not let anyone touch it. Controls roads.

251
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,157
Controlling what comes out of Jerusalem.

252
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,899
Arrest anyone who says he is alive and find out where he heard.

253
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:32,901
Since, tribunule.

254
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:36,217
Find the dead bodies in recent days.

255
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,748
Controlling them and check the signs of crucifixion.

256
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,650
You dig?

257
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,800
All !

258
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,788
And bring them to me immediately.

259
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,600
- Tribunule. - I asked in private.

260
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,250
Where's your boyfriend?

261
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,500
He does not want to come to speak.

262
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,200
Seriously ?

263
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,004
He had issues to talk about the theft of the Nazarene.

264
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:38,314
- He is afraid. Me too. - Very good.

265
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
M-Ati dezonorat.

266
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,250
Sleeping during the Guard is death.

267
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,600
But the prefect forgiven.

268
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,200
You can return to barracks.

269
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,850
- Unpunished? - If you are truthful.

270
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,250
I was attacked while asleep

271
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,650
by furious disciples of the Nazarene.

272
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,550
They took the body and they told us to say that rose.

273
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,550
Angry? How many were there?

274
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,100
- 8, 10 ... I'm not sure. - They were armed?

275
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:18,400
Yes Yes.

276
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,250
- I've seen while you were sleeping? - No, I ... we ...

277
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:27,985
We woke up when they cut the ropes.

278
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,711
- Did the Taiat. - Da. Da.

279
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,400
Then they rolled the stone.

280
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,250
- They took the body and fled. - While you look at them?

281
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,450
Yes, but they threatened us with a spear.

282
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Soldier !

283
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,289
Ti was ordered to say something?

284
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,050
- You've been drinking. - No.

285
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:57,431
- No? - No.

286
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,969
What lies have you told?

287
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,849
Open the gates!

288
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:33,801
- It was stolen? - So they claim.

289
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:36,098
So what.

290
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,825
They're afraid that might be raised.

291
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:42,863
It might be the Messiah.

292
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:49,150
- That being said. - Arrest him!

293
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,700
Turn it!

294
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,900
- That when he died? - For at least a week.

295
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,100
- And these? - I am with thieves who died.

296
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,100
Let's go.

297
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,102
Over two days will be unrecognizable.

298
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:12,744
Wait to see how it will be on the battlefield.

299
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:31,627
Not.

300
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,378
It lacks a hand. See the hole in the other?

301
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,119
Not him. He has broken legs.

302
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:40,076
That's why we need you, tribunule.

303
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:42,642
And this tomb is done hastily.

304
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:56,472
- So. - I have questioned 40.

305
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,016
You should talk to about 11.

306
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,550
One of them might be a disciple of his.

307
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,000
- I apologize. - Eat chicory.

308
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,850
Over time, the stomach will get used.

309
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,350
- Put them inside. One by one. - Yes, tribunule.

310
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,750
- Who took the body? - I do not know.

311
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,500
It is said that you are an honest man.

312
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,300
And a disciple of Jesus.

313
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,050
The truth today you will not be fatal.

314
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,100
He was impressed by what he said and teaches.

315
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,306
I think not deserve to die like that.

316
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,602
They have opened the grave to steal a body

317
00:34:47,604 --> 00:34:50,558
and to spread a lie that threatens Rome and the Sanhedrin.

318
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,735
There were followers of Jesus.

319
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:55,050
Not real ones.

320
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
They are desperate.

321
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,650
Who they say they are resurrected

322
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,050
to lead Israel against us.

323
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,984
Messiah.

324
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:13,333
You think ?

325
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,150
If Jesus were alive,

326
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,750
I think you should embrace as a brother.

327
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,700
Even if you disown you.

328
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,200
You can leave.

329
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,645
I will try other means before being forced to make cuts.

330
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,550
It's not something I said, tribunule.

331
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:55,000
I admit. You asked if he would be a king.

332
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,350
That's his crown.

333
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,000
Take a seat.

334
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,950
Why tremble?

335
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Are you a novel.

336
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,800
They heard screaming: "Jesus lives!"

337
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,850
With joy, as report says.

338
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,450
- Why, just that you could not see. - I heard on the streets!

339
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:44,200
- From the past? - No, I heard his voice.

340
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,026
- Jesus. - Two days ago.

341
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:49,112
I recognize voices.

342
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,550
- I hear. - I do not doubt.

343
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,850
Erai o adeptã de-a nazarineanului
Miriam ?

344
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:58,500
Or just a follower, a follower?

345
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,250
He loved me.

346
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
An old woman ... I make me feel good.

347
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,750
In what sense?

348
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,000
If you had known, you could understand.

349
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,950
You have to stop saying that people raised from the dead.

350
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,550
Came.

351
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,450
- Do you want to know what he said? - Sure you do.

352
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,150
You are a seed that already bore fruit.

353
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,300
- It's too late. - Come on.

354
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,156
Next is important, tribunule.

355
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:25,887
Today I pray thee, Mars, the god of the Jews but, Yahweh.

356
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:26,889
Hear me!

357
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,170
Withdraw favor of defending those people

358
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:32,548
si dã-mi-o mie.

359
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,648
If you do the signs,

360
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,182
I high temples for you and I will devote games in your honor.

361
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,450
You know what I'm doing?

362
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:55,382
Gives.

363
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,000
Who told you that Nazareth crucified alive?

364
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,600
A friend...

365
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
of a friend.

366
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,000
A friend of Jesus. A disciple somehow?

367
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,600
Either way, do not lie.

368
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,200
This friend says that I was told ...

369
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,750
that they saw two women.

370
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,750
They went to the tomb at dawn that day and found him naked.

371
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,000
Then they saw Jesus on the road.

372
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:43,250
In life.

373
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,550
Their names.

374
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,950
Either way, we'll get the answer.

375
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,250
I know only one.

376
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,550
It's a slut.

377
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,700
Maria Magdalena.

378
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:10,067
It was last seen on the morning of theft.

379
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:12,348
Early. Then he disappeared.

380
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,950
As we found out, tribunule.

381
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:18,048
- Where does it work? - If you work? It's a street.

382
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:23,100
- You did not bring anyone recognize her? - But how? Who could?

383
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,250
Who knows one Maria Magdalena?

384
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,307
They were surrounded. We had to retreat.

385
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,098
A strategic withdrawal.

386
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,200
Many of us were captured and taken to the hills.

387
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,900
At night I heard screaming.

388
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:55,065
We looked up.

389
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:59,961
I put the stake to show us.

390
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,600
IALA why should not you pity for them.

391
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,248
Ea and?

392
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:15,289
Not.

393
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,649
She is !

394
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:30,178
Do not move!

395
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,850
She is !

396
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,850
Pace, Maria.

397
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,650
What were you running from us?

398
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,650
Instinct.

399
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,650
I had seen.

400
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,500
In my old life?

401
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,097
Jesus' death were there beside his mother.

402
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,045
She was with you to the grave?

403
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,400
If you know what happened there ...

404
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,050
- You're not thinking ... - Enlighten me.

405
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,700
It's beyond us ...

406
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,850
Spare me riddles.

407
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,500
Where have you gone to Jesus?

408
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,457
- Is here. - It's a ghost?

409
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:38,774
It's a spirit that returned to life?

410
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,422
- Open your heart and look. - It's a hallucination.

411
00:42:43,424 --> 00:42:45,712
To keep alive a faith.

412
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,778
I can get what I want, to force you to say you threatened with death.

413
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,277
Does not matter.

414
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,788
- A martyr. - No!

415
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:00,748
Give me the others and I will restore freedom.

416
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,500
They are already free.

417
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,850
Show me the Messiah!

418
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,500
Dead or alive.

419
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,500
Go to His disciples.

420
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,800
Looking for something you will not ever find tribunule.

421
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,250
Looking wrong.

422
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,050
It's crazy. Refuses to think logically.

423
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,950
It could be a witch. Be stoned? Or so close?

424
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,800
Better ... let it go.

425
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,850
What?

426
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,950
Go ahead '. That woman is unwell.

427
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,325
You have not slept for two days, tribunule. The mind feels.

428
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,000
- When it ends, wake me. - Yes, tribunule,

429
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,500
Tu, Ridica-te!

430
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,350
Misca-te!

431
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,250
Tribunule, drained all the sand.

432
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,595
Pilate called you.

433
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,709
- You dug death? - Try them all.

434
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:36,595
Jewish graves?

435
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,850
Makes sense to me. He was a Jew and died.

436
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,800
Do not you realize how much anger you caused.

437
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,010
Over two days, no one will think about it.

438
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:52,148
Nature has its course.

439
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,543
Caesar's spies will find it.

440
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,655
An unfortunate circumstances.

441
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,450
For both, tribunule.

442
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:08,000
I want them body here! Until the night!

443
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:19,650
They are key disciples. If we find them, we will have on him.

444
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,250
For your help.

445
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,800
You will receive, if you do what you ask.

446
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,850
The disciples of the Nazarene.

447
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,850
How many are their names.

448
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,000
Their plans, where hidden weapons.

449
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,350
Where they meet, who now leads them.

450
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,850
Where they hid the body.

451
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,650
Just do it quickly.

452
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,850
There are 12.

453
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,700
No, there are now 11.

454
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,250
Circle of Jesus.

455
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,650
- They hid, but do not know where. - Do you have a name?

456
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,250
I will give you one.

457
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,300
- Who Bartholomew? - I am.

458
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,850
Take it.

459
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:44,850
- What do you get spread fantasies? - I saw with my own eyes, tribunule!

460
00:47:44,852 --> 00:47:48,000
I walked with him, talked to me!

461
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,800
Of course, it's unbelievable but it's true!

462
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,050
Bring him here. Now.

463
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,129
Or looks my body.

464
00:47:57,131 --> 00:47:58,993
Lo lost, snake skin.

465
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,851
God is not in my job.

466
00:48:01,853 --> 00:48:03,276
God ?

467
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:07,612
Yahweh is manifested by a poor dead Jew?

468
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,034
So it seems !

469
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,200
What does rebirth?

470
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,200
Eternal life!

471
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,426
To all. For all those who believe.

472
00:48:21,428 --> 00:48:23,020
Best means of recruitment.

473
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:29,198
Much better than assault. How many are you?

474
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,900
We are now few. The only weapon we have is love.

475
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,000
But this ... well, that changes everything!

476
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,000
What intentions do you have?

477
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,224
Why you is so afraid? Empire does not mean anything to him.

478
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:54,300
You must give to Caesar what is Caesar's. That taught.

479
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,200
And if ordering your crucifixion?

480
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:02,250
What? I could a serene face. I'm ready.

481
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,550
Have you ever seen a crucified man?

482
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:11,787
Not.

483
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,950
I do not think I've seen there.

484
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,450
Probably because you ran.

485
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,250
It is not like that ?

486
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,450
I'll tell you what you missed.

487
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:29,834
Ia-l !

488
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,850
Imagine that nailed this pierce your arms.

489
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,991
And then pierce your feet. Can you imagine that?

490
00:49:43,993 --> 00:49:49,272
You will remain hanging from nails that will pierce your bones.

491
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:55,671
Now you need to decide if the agony is worse here

492
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,010
or here?

493
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,250
Your weight will torture all the time.

494
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,150
Then you discover that you can not breathe.

495
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,600
You will realize that you will not be able to breathe easy.

496
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,750
And that each breath the rest of your life

497
00:50:12,752 --> 00:50:15,100
It will be like sucking a wet cloth.

498
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,400
He was lucky. He hung a few hours.

499
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:21,050
Many people have days on end.

500
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:23,700
And if he felt something in the end,

501
00:50:23,702 --> 00:50:27,548
sure was spear that pierced his ribs to reach the heart.

502
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,004
There I looked around,

503
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:31,689
but all her ribs were broken as to give it away.

504
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:34,725
- Sometimes bury them with nails. - Please ends!

505
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,250
Reach.

506
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,500
Not to mention his body.

507
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,500
By now it be horrible.

508
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,050
Do I ever wonder once ...

509
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,900
Where are the other disciples? Stop wondering by now.

510
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,100
Tell me and I'll be free.

511
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,900
He assured me that?

512
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,100
You have my word.

513
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,350
Where am I ?

514
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,683
I'm everywhere !

515
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,950
There are more ?

516
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,750
Not those who can recognize.

517
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,831
I'm done here ?

518
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,150
The East ?

519
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,750
There are holes here, here and here.

520
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,950
- Rana side. - But the image? I do not recognize.

521
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,361
Nobody can.

522
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,550
We could say it was him.

523
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,400
At this point, any body can Nazarene.

524
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,750
But I find out who took it. That's the threat.

525
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,550
The threat is a creature with many heads.

526
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:10,000
Now I need you elsewhere. I have problems in Hebron.

527
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:16,900
But we must solve this. I need some time next week.

528
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,200
More than 7 days you have to be in Hebron.

529
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,100
You are dangerously smart, tribunule.

530
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,550
Can I trust you if you turn your back?

531
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,600
That's what I'm afraid most.

532
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,096
We are made from the same dough.

533
00:53:39,345 --> 00:53:43,847
I remember the time when I was like you. So sure, so ...

534
00:53:46,174 --> 00:53:47,565
I forgot.

535
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,800
- What difference can have reality? - What?

536
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,100
Over several years we will be so.

537
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,900
Open!

538
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,700
What happened?

539
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,600
It seems that went to Hebron.

540
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,800
I told the soldiers to prepare.

541
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,000
Guards were seen at the tomb.

542
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,482
- They left temple. - Where am I ?

543
00:54:26,484 --> 00:54:27,959
It's not clear.

544
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:30,151
They say that they spent money.

545
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,750
I know you can win.

546
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,950
And I know that's gonna happen.

547
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,500
Your ambition was observed.

548
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:59,900
Bravo! Is wonderful ! Sing!

549
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:07,000
Sing them again! That before!

550
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,900
Sing them again! Please !

551
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:15,400
Yes, it's a beautiful song.

552
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,550
It's an expensive wine for a legionary.

553
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,750
Have you hidden! How do you win these coins?

554
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,800
Om the dead.

555
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:39,500
Sure you do.

556
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,800
Prefect forgave me.

557
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,550
She forgave me.

558
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,850
You can not give me anything.

559
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,600
I said what was proclaimed.

560
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:02,550
Say it again.

561
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,248
What?

562
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:08,100
Let's see if the same thing as your buddy said.

563
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,896
I was attacked at night while asleep, by a group of ...

564
00:56:15,898 --> 00:56:17,728
The priesthood they were paid to say that.

565
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,337
They stole the body!

566
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:21,729
And they asked us to say that Risen!

567
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,234
How has reached 10 stone steps from the grave?

568
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,975
It took seven people, including myself, as it tumbling!

569
00:56:27,977 --> 00:56:31,198
The ropes were not cut but were slapped as floss.

570
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,642
Seal melted butter. You want to go back there?

571
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:34,754
No!

572
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,900
What troubles you so much?

573
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,000
Do not lie !

574
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,800
How did they get?

575
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,950
Where the body of the Nazarene?

576
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:52,268
You have forgotten us two!

577
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,246
I had to eat.

578
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:59,150
For this wine she slept.

579
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,298
I stayed awake two days after the crucifixion.

580
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,900
What can happen when guards dead?

581
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,800
I slept on row until ...

582
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,230
Until ?

583
00:57:18,287 --> 00:57:23,650
By the time he woke up a terrible ...

584
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,300
A terrible lightning.

585
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,922
Night ended ...

586
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:34,803
and was a burning smell and ropes as if exploded.

587
00:57:34,805 --> 00:57:38,282
And stone flew like a leaf, and suddenly, the sun ...

588
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:42,141
He rose from the grave.

589
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,806
That was the sun.

590
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,050
Era...

591
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,300
It was everywhere.

592
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:56,261
And then a chip that appeared ... A face appeared and I could not look.

593
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:58,383
It was a terrible light and ...

594
00:57:58,385 --> 00:58:00,334
There was a man.

595
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,600
It was not.

596
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:07,459
And there was a voice around us which we could not understand.

597
00:58:07,461 --> 00:58:13,143
And we took her to flee. And I ran away until ...

598
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,700
Until I managed to think again!

599
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:26,000
Then we went to the priestly because you like you told us to do.

600
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,950
Caiaphas and will paid to say something else.

601
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,450
Tribunule...

602
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:39,000
I saw many in the service of kings.

603
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,736
Cannibals ...

604
00:58:45,195 --> 00:58:49,245
I saw a man captured by a marine snake ...

605
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,050
but something I've never seen.

606
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,700
So...

607
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,450
Please explain this to me.

608
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,450
You were drunk.

609
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,100
Have you seen the sun.

610
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:20,000
A wine was poisoned?

611
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,250
Seriously ?

612
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,200
What you think?

613
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,748
Maybe there was opium, or even incense.

614
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,500
Maybe the disciples stole the body through witchcraft,

615
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:35,050
The priesthood as saying.

616
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,000
Or maybe our story is true.

617
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,100
That true?

618
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,300
I do not know.

619
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,850
So I drink.

620
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,522
Sir. Tribunule!

621
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,541
I've found.

622
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,200
Romans came!

623
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,943
Hurry! Hurry! Come!

624
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,000
That's home. I lost it there.

625
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:31,348
- Lost? - I think they went in there!

626
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,131
- Just think? - Yes, like that. When I came to tell you ...

627
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:36,600
I saw and other disciples who came from that.

628
01:01:36,602 --> 01:01:39,455
Upstairs are my reward!

629
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,585
The Romans! Hurry!

630
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,847
Tribunule !

631
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:00,530
I six on this side. Check every home!

632
01:02:00,532 --> 01:02:02,208
You five, on the aialaltã.

633
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,946
I want one or two in life! Come on! Move!

634
01:02:04,948 --> 01:02:07,936
Move! I stuck out and go back!

635
01:02:13,779 --> 01:02:14,992
Not.

636
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,350
Tribunule! You found something ?

637
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:29,500
Nothing.

638
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,350
Gather people back to camp.

639
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,649
Tribunule...

640
01:03:35,651 --> 01:03:38,200
Withdraw!

641
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,650
Then come back.

642
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,550
Tribunule, we're close! I feel it !

643
01:03:45,552 --> 01:03:49,050
Not that I need you.

644
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,650
I do not need you.

645
01:03:58,450 --> 01:03:59,800
Sir.

646
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,300
Withdrawal!

647
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:09,450
Soldiers, we return to camp!

648
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,475
In mars !

649
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:47,450
Welcome, Clavius.

650
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,800
Join us, brother.

651
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,950
They are not enemies.

652
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,198
Do you take !

653
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,233
- God! - Thomas, where have you been?

654
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,250
Iarta-code!

655
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,300
Iarta-codes.

656
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,083
This mid-ceri Dispensa crumb? What?

657
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,050
We have to fear.

658
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,400
We are free.

659
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,000
Touch.

660
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,122
And here.

661
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,770
How?

662
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,800
Jesus!

663
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,350
- Jesus! - Where?

664
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,993
- Jesus! - Jesus!

665
01:06:33,995 --> 01:06:36,276
- Returns ? - Where did he go ?

666
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,550
How will I know ?

667
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,750
And now ? Simon?

668
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:51,850
He said to stick to Jerusalem to receive the Holy Spirit.

669
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,029
- What have I got now? - I do not know.

670
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:58,279
- Galilee. - What?

671
01:06:58,281 --> 01:06:59,350
When it appeared in the streets,

672
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,400
Jesus said:

673
01:07:01,402 --> 01:07:04,098
go and call my brothers that go into Galilee.

674
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,530
There we meet. He told me.

675
01:07:06,532 --> 01:07:07,925
I saw.

676
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:13,000
In Galilee you will see once.

677
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,400
Pay attention to them.

678
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,500
Simon !

679
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,300
Then let go.

680
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,550
- Let's go, my brothers. - Mary look after you.

681
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,783
- Goodbye, Maria. - Goodbye, brothers.

682
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,842
Forward!

683
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,800
Demand a ransom?

684
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,850
"Nu cautati code."

685
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,250
"Do not follow me or wonderful."

686
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,250
"There persecuted anyone in my name."

687
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:45,850
"I saw two things which they can not reconcile."

688
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:53,200
"One dead, no doubt. And the same man alive again."

689
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:58,624
"I'll follow Nazarene to discover the truth."

690
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,750
Clavius Aquila Valerius.

691
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,100
E seal of, sir.

692
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:14,250
- It must be epidemic. - My right arm comes back against me.

693
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,800
How Could a Jew to follow that?

694
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,950
Probable...

695
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:25,600
- It's true. - If it were so ...

696
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,881
kill him again.

697
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,033
Brothers let go.

698
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,150
In life, if you can.

699
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,500
And even if he were dead, would not mind less.

700
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:44,100
Will You Find at Caesarea.

701
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,850
Sir!

702
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:53,800
Leave. In north to Galilee.

703
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,100
Ten days later the King will be here.

704
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,918
Ten days.

705
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:06,651
Forward!

706
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:43,806
I brought water!

707
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:03,950
Water!

708
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,620
It will remain mark. I hope you know that.

709
01:12:29,424 --> 01:12:30,704
Yahweh !

710
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,844
Hallowed be Thy name.

711
01:12:32,846 --> 01:12:35,050
Give us the daily bread.

712
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:41,125
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive our debtors.

713
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:44,810
And lead us not into temptation.

714
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:58,915
Deliver us from the evil one.

715
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,418
Amin.

716
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,171
A son of Yahweh be.

717
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,400
And you think?

718
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,500
Do you believe ?

719
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:28,450
After that, yes!

720
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,500
Raised from the dead, he eats, sleeps and then disappears.

721
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,750
It has a body.

722
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,550
Yahweh same body that it gives all people.

723
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:44,300
So he approached.

724
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,250
I have all the answers.

725
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:50,183
We marvel us.

726
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,650
Why did not showed all?

727
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,700
He could be killed again?

728
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,850
I do not know ! I do not know...

729
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,566
I wish I knew, but I do not know.

730
01:14:08,568 --> 01:14:10,794
You will find in Galilee.

731
01:14:10,796 --> 01:14:15,723
We are disciples. We follow him to reveal.

732
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,561
I think that prepares us.

733
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:28,940
For what ?

734
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,100
If.

735
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,700
Pilate will not stop looking for me.

736
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,684
We threatening.

737
01:15:02,952 --> 01:15:04,988
After coming after me.

738
01:15:09,028 --> 01:15:11,092
I can not know where we are.

739
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:14,910
I already know.

740
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,600
They are thirsty for blood.

741
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,380
We are not afraid.

742
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,351
We are not.

743
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,096
Should you have for what was entrusted.

744
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,630
Back!

745
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:30,543
Around here.

746
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:04,224
Come, we must hurry.

747
01:17:04,226 --> 01:17:06,439
Grabiti-withdrawal!

748
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,800
Please !

749
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:23,900
Ruthless, tribunule.

750
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:28,100
- That's what I've learned. - It was a bad lesson.

751
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,100
I dub you the master.

752
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,300
But let them pass.

753
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,500
If nazarineanul?

754
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,600
A dispãrut.

755
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,998
They are not enemies.

756
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,100
You destiny of the world in your hands.

757
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,700
To know that.

758
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,150
I think that...

759
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,200
... Is in the hands of these men.

760
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,900
Today nobody dies.

761
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,250
None.

762
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,200
Now go away.

763
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,200
Does not say anything.

764
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,638
Remember that.

765
01:19:56,104 --> 01:19:57,550
Why just here?

766
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,650
He told us to come.

767
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:04,500
Sometimes it's hard to understand.

768
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,800
Simon will to eat.

769
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,800
Where to fish.

770
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,400
To fish! Come!

771
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,598
He will find!

772
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,900
Come on ! The boat! FISHING!

773
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:09,750
We are here !

774
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,300
Brothers!

775
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:17,850
To fish!

776
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,468
Pull. Pull!

777
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:00,050
Try again?

778
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,550
Twice more.

779
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,663
Then sleep will wake up the sun.

780
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:45,881
You got lucky?

781
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:51,093
Try right again.

782
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:16,350
- My brothers, wake up! - What's happening?

783
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,148
Come on, brother!

784
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:20,063
Awake! Prepare dragnet!

785
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,199
Arunca!

786
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,500
What happened?

787
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,950
- Pull! - It's too hard!

788
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,750
- The water is not deep! - Shoot! Will go !

789
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,198
Something hanging it!

790
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,550
- It's over! - Pull!

791
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:53,100
It's over!

792
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:57,450
It's over!

793
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:05,450
It's over!

794
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,050
How did you know ?

795
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:14,200
Jesus!

796
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:20,450
- Jesus! - It's back!

797
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:26,000
- Jesus! - Jesus!

798
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,623
Jesus, I'm back!

799
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,292
- Thomas! - Thank you.

800
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,400
Did you know that he will rise again?

801
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,150
He told us, but ...

802
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,850
Frankly, I thought.

803
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:34,748
Why did you follow?

804
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:40,200
A leper! To leave ! Go away !

805
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,100
- To leave ! - Go away !

806
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:51,200
- To leave ! - You can not stay here! Can not !

807
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,613
- Blestematule! - Delete it!

808
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:11,450
Delete it from here! And never come back!

809
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,800
- I do. - What ?

810
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,050
He will heal the man.

811
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,150
Cum ?

812
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,050
Look ! Just look !

813
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,250
- Nobody wants to touch me. - A miracle.

814
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,978
I saw him do more.

815
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,746
Do you have faith?

816
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,300
Brothers!

817
01:27:43,329 --> 01:27:44,607
Here's why.

818
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,281
What are you looking for ?

819
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,050
Trouble.

820
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,300
Will appear.

821
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:28,379
That's a threat to them. To Pilate, Caiaphas and Rome.

822
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:31,805
There will be trouble for us.

823
01:28:32,429 --> 01:28:33,836
You must have faith.

824
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:54,800
Came.

825
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:56,600
Come to do two steps.

826
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,950
- Why ? - As to hang.

827
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:04,150
Simon loves me?

828
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:07,300
Yes, just know that yes.

829
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,750
- You love Me ? - Yes.

830
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,150
- Simon, you love me? - From all my heart.

831
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,235
You have to look after my sheep.

832
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,550
I do not know what to ask.

833
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,450
Speak to the heart.

834
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:10,350
Fail to reconcile all this

835
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:14,700
the world we know.

836
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,400
You saw with your eyes and you still have doubts?

837
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:24,400
Imagine that never saw the doubt. What should do?

838
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:29,900
Why are you afraid?

839
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
To be wrong.

840
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:39,700
To bet my immortality.

841
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:45,300
Then follow my father.

842
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,850
When you died...

843
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,050
I was there.

844
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,850
- I helped. - Know.

845
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,700
What are you doing, Clavius?

846
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:27,550
Certainty? Pace?

847
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:31,400
A day without death?

848
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:22,050
- Awake! - Brothers!

849
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,750
- Jesus! - He left !

850
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:33,000
My brothers, stand up!

851
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:39,150
Jesus!

852
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:53,250
Brethren.

853
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:04,450
I go to prepare a place for you.

854
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:11,500
Go into the world and preach the gospel ... all over

855
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,900
all nations.

856
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,550
You will be witnesses of Jerusalem.

857
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,574
In Judea to the ends of the world.

858
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:31,000
You know you'll always be with you!

859
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,011
Always!

860
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,444
My Lord.

861
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:33,250
It's not just about eternal life, but about how it is lived.

862
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,400
By sword or by love.

863
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:39,021
That it can change. Here.

864
01:35:39,023 --> 01:35:40,023
It's time.

865
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,800
Farewell, my brothers.

866
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:45,450
A once more can you say.

867
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:47,900
Amin.

868
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:53,750
- God bless you, Peter. - Goodbye.

869
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:00,300
- Goodbye, my brothers. - Goodbye, Peter. Take care of yourself.

870
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:06,519
Farewell! May peace be with you.

871
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:14,900
You could join us tribunule.

872
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,750
Jerusalem only bring trouble.

873
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:21,400
Troubles ...

874
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:25,650
We were called to receive the Holy Spirit whom he promised ROMANU.

875
01:36:25,652 --> 01:36:27,250
Your job is to fish.

876
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:31,000
Yes, but people.

877
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:36,450
How could I do otherwise?

878
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:42,100
You fish and you, Clavius?

879
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,350
Therefore...

880
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,400
Farewell, brother!

881
01:36:57,150 --> 01:37:00,150
Farewell.

882
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:09,250
Lord to protect you.

883
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:16,199
I will carry with me ...

884
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:21,000
Forever.

885
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:28,600
Peter, come on!

886
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:32,000
- Come on! - My brothers !

887
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:35,250
- Grãbeste-you! - Wine!

888
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:37,550
Wait for me!

889
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,257
Wait for me!

890
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:33,900
I doubt that we will have news about them.

891
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,757
Tribunule !

892
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,600
Pay with this.

893
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,450
Tribunule !

894
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:16,500
Do you really believe in all this?

895
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:24,500
I believe...

896
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:28,954
It'll never be the same.

897
01:39:31,378 --> 01:39:36,378
