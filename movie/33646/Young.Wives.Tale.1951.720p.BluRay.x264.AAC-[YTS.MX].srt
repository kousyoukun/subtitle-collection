3
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,332
- Mrs. Pennant!

4
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,082
- What is it, Nanny?

5
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,457
- Will you kindly come up
and deal with your child?

6
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,916
He refuses to come out of his bath.

7
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,707
- Oh, Nanny. Can't you cope?

8
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,416
No, I can't. He's upsetting my Elizabeth.

9
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,166
- Rodney, you'll have to come

10
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,832
and do something about Valentine.

11
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,667
- What?

12
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:22,874
- Rodney, Valentine won't
come out of his bath,

13
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,416
and Nanny's absolutely furious.

14
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,124
- Oh, really Sabina.

15
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,416
It would save a little trouble,

16
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,457
if you'd bath little Valentine yourself.

17
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,041
- Save who a lot of trouble?

18
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:32,875
- Everybody.

19
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,499
After all, she's Mary's nanny, not ours.

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,999
You shouldn't ask her
to do things for you.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,480
Then she wouldn't be able to grumble.

22
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,207
- Will you come out with that bath?

23
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,707
No, I won't.

24
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,708
- Horrid little boy.

25
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:44,916
- I'm so sorry, Nanny.

26
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,999
In future I'll just have to
bath him myself, that's all.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,707
- I'm very willing to
help you on occasion.

28
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,874
But you would have to
discipline the child.

29
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,125
That's all right, darling.

30
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,333
- Well, young man?

31
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:57,167
- I won't, I won't go.

32
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,541
- Come out of that bath,
before I get cross.

33
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,542
- NO-

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,499
- Why don't you just pick him up?

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
- You try.

36
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:13,917
You see?

37
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,749
Oh, darling. You are clever.

38
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,291
- Why can't you think for
yourselves occasionally?

39
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,792
- Miss Mary's not paying
me for you, Mrs. Pennant.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,249
- How do I do that?

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,666
- Hey, why don't you drowned
her while you're about it?

42
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,124
- Now.

43
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,333
- Hello! Who do you want?

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,999
Oh. I'm sorry, Mary.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,499
I've had nothing but
interruptions this evening.

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,166
That's right, my son, your daughter,

47
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:32,916
Nanny, Sabina, and now a boys bugle band.

48
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,582
- Well, I'm sorry to interrupt you again.

49
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,999
But I wanted to remind
Sabina about Nanny's tea.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,124
Twice this week she's complained to me

51
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,749
she's had to get it herself.

52
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,832
- I don't see why Sabina
should wait on the old-

53
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,542
- Now, Rodney. She does help
with Valentine, you know.

54
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,124
Rodney, I know.

55
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,499
But just to try and find another one.

56
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,166
All right.

57
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,582
Ooh, if Bruce gets home first,

58
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,582
tell him I won't be late, will you?

59
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,500
Goodbye.

60
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,874
- Goodbye, yes. Goodbye.

61
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,666
- Make me a good boy.

62
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,166
- Bless Mommy and Daddy.

63
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,749
- Bless Nanny.

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,750
"No!"

65
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,791
- Go on now, kind little boy. Bless Nanny.

66
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:10,792
- NO-

67
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:21,125
- You're a wicked one.
You're a wicked one.

68
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,417
- Rodney, did you knock
my clean things over?

69
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,957
- I did not.

70
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,792
They were burning.

71
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:26,666
I went across to move
them, and they fell over.

72
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,833
- Well, why didn't you pick them up?

73
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,291
- I haven't time to do your
work, as well as my own.

74
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:37,582
- Oh, darling. I know
it's difficult for you.

75
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,749
But don't forget, if Mary
and Bruce hadn't taken us in,

76
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,624
we'd still be looking
for somewhere to live.

77
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,625
- You call this living?

78
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,708
- The kettle!

79
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,167
- Hey, close the door!

80
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,291
- What's the matter, darling?

81
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,916
- It's impossible to be
creative in this atmosphere,

82
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,457
what with whistling kettles,
and whistling draughts.

83
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,291
- Well, at least the whistling draughts

84
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,208
won't bother you anymore.

85
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,541
I found a screen.

86
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,874
- I bet you had to pay
through the nose for it.

87
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,207
- Haven't got to pay for
anything. I borrowed it.

88
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,582
- Who from?

89
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,124
- Victor.

90
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,125
- Oh.

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,916
- Why do you say Oh, like that?

92
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,666
- Oh, I'm sorry. I should have said, oh.

93
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:21,207
- You're being extremely
childish about Victor.

94
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,999
He's been very kind to us.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,624
- Very kind to you, you mean.

96
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,457
- Well, anyway he's got three
screens and he only uses two.

97
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,374
So he said I could have the other one.

98
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,832
- That's disgusting,
having all those screens.

99
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,207
- What do you mean?

100
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,666
- Well, only a flirty sort of fellow

101
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,167
would have three screens.

102
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,832
- Don't be absurd.

103
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,875
Oh my goodness. I've forgotten
to put out Nanny's tea.

104
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,082
I'm so sorry, Nanny.

105
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,583
- It's quite all right, madam.

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,666
- Oh dear. Somebody's been
at the chicken I'm afraid.

107
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,999
There's only one leg left.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,667
- A leg will do nicely, madam.

109
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,875
- Let me help you with your salad.

110
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,750
- Thank you, madam.

111
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:44,291
- What's the matter,
darling? No inspiration?

112
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,125
- It's no good, Sabina.

113
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:47,416
I can't work with you fitting
in and out, and ironing.

114
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,832
- Well, I don't see why
ironing should disturb you.

115
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,249
It doesn't make any noise, does it?

116
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,999
- It makes a clatter every time you

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,832
put it on that damn little iron thing.

118
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,833
- All right, Rodney.

119
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:01,333
I'll put it down so quietly,
I promise you won't hear it.

120
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,125
- Oh, no.

121
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,666
- Well, what's the matter now?

122
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,957
- Now I shall be listening
to see if I can hear it.

123
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:11,958
- Very well.

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,249
I'll leave the rest of
the ironing till tomorrow,

125
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,083
and go and sit up in the bedroom.

126
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,750
- Sabina.

127
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,208
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,374
I know I'm being irritable, but
it's just one of those days.

129
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,957
- I know, darling.

130
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,249
- It's not your fault I can't work.

131
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,291
I'm just not in the mood.

132
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:33,375
- I know what.

133
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,458
- What?

134
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,249
- You're going to relax
completely for a bit.

135
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,167
- Oh, I know darling.

136
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:40,207
But I really want to get on with my work.

137
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,666
- No, you're going to lie down here,

138
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,207
and let the work go for a bit.

139
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,957
- Well, who's gonna mend my typewriter?

140
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,792
- Nevermind about your typewriter.

141
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,208
And now, cross your hands.

142
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,291
You relaxed yet?

143
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,624
- Well, not completely.

144
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,707
- That's because you're still thinking.

145
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,749
Try and make your mind a blank.

146
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,667
- Make my mind a blank?

147
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:11,999
- Yes, don't think about anything at all.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,791
- Oh, I don't think I
can possibly do that.

149
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,666
- Well, very well if you must think,

150
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:19,582
think about something
pleasant and soothing, like

151
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,832
a boat drifting slowly down
the stream on a Summer day,

152
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:28,249
or cattle grazing in a lush meadow.

153
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,666
- And which would you prefer?

154
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:33,083
- No darling, it's what you would prefer.

155
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,832
What are you thinking about?

156
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,832
Cattle drifting
down stream in a boat.

157
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,541
- Is it helping you to relax?

158
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,875
- Not really. One of the
cows keep falling out.

159
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,499
- You remember how I used to

160
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,666
stroke your forehead
when you had neuralgia?

161
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,916
It always took it away, didn't it?

162
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,749
- Yes, darling. Always.

163
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,249
- If I can take away
neuralgia, I ought to be able

164
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,958
to take away worrying
thoughts too, shouldn't I?

165
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,916
Have you stopped thinking yet?

166
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:04,917
- Practically.

167
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,749
- Rodney, If I have the gift of taking

168
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,541
worrying thoughts out of your head,

169
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,332
perhaps after you've had a little rest,

170
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,832
and your head's been empty for a while,

171
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,750
I might find I can put some ideas into it.

172
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,542
- Darling, you are.

173
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:25,582
- Mrs. Pennant, Mrs. Pennant!

174
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,666
- What's the matter with her?

175
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,458
- Something's happened to Valentine.

176
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,333
Corning, Nanny.

177
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,707
Is anything wrong, Nanny?

178
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,582
- Is it your wish that your Valentine

179
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,457
should be in bed with my Elizabeth?

180
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,749
- Certainly not.

181
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,957
You must put him back
in his own bed at once.

182
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,916
- I would prefer it if
you did that yourself.

183
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:48,708
- You're a bad, bad boy.
Mommy's very cross with you.

184
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,999
- In my opinion, the child
deserves a sound spanking.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,833
- Are you gonna spank Elizabeth?

186
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:57,957
- Elizabeth? Of course not.

187
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,499
Elizabeth did nothing to encourage him.

188
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,874
- How you girls stick together.

189
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,332
- And what do you mean by that remark?

190
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,666
- I mean, I can't believe any son of mine

191
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,832
would enter a ladies bed uninvited.

192
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,082
- Could the child encourage
him? She can't talk.

193
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,250
- There are other ways.

194
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,332
- Anyway, you don't know what happened.

195
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,749
You were having your tea.

196
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,291
- And if I was? I suppose
I must eat sometime.

197
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,624
- Well, of course you must.

198
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,957
- I beg your pardon.

199
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,916
I thought you were insinuating something.

200
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:24,249
- Really, Nanny. What
is the matter with you?

201
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,207
- Everything, it appears.

202
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,124
Mrs. Banning is entitled
to find fault with me.

203
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,749
But I would remind you that anything I do

204
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,499
for your child, I do to oblige you.

205
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,957
- Oblige, my foot.

206
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,416
You're doing it to make
it worth your while.

207
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,791
- Be quiet, Rodney.

208
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:37,499
- I will not be quiet Rodney.

209
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,874
I won't be intimidated by
you, even though you did

210
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,333
play fullback for the
Norland Institute, in 1881.

211
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,416
- Rodney, how could you?

212
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:48,874
- Nanny, wait.

213
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,792
- And I'll tell you
something else, Madam Blott.

214
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:51,166
You have a very peculiar face.

215
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,000
- Rodney.

216
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,361
- I'd be glad if you'd keep
your husband's tone to yourself!

217
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:57,750
- You idiot.

218
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,249
- That's the way to talk to them.

219
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,499
It will have it's affect, you'll see.

220
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,458
- I don't doubt it. We'd
better try and apologise.

221
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,291
Oh, Nanny I'm terribly sorry.

222
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,082
I've never been
so insulted in my life.

223
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,166
I sure he wasn't-

224
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,999
- Ah, Eve. Heaven
sent you in my hour of need.

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,833
I want your help.

226
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,582
- Just let me slip up to my room first.

227
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,249
- You can slip up in a
moment. This is urgent.

228
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,499
Eve darling, can you explain,
as a professional typist,

229
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,291
why every letter on this machine works

230
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,999
with the exception of the letter B?

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,124
Do suppose it doesn't want
me to type rude words?

232
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,332
- But you wouldn't, would you?

233
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,582
- Darling, I adore you.

234
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,291
- I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

235
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,999
- Why not? We all adore you.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,249
- I didn't mean that part.
I mean calling me, darling.

237
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,749
I don't think you ought to.

238
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,499
- Ooh. You do feel strongly
about it, don't you?

239
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,166
- It must seem ridiculous
to you, but you see.

240
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,541
Oh, I can't tell you.

241
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:47,749
- Oh, I wish you would.

242
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,582
I mean, as a writer, I'm
interested in psychology.

243
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,582
- Well, if you really think
I can help you in your work.

244
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,417
- Oh, yes.

245
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,042
- I'll try to explain.

246
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,124
I suppose it's hard for
a man to understand,

247
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,541
but for woman some words,
sweet enough in themselves,

248
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:07,083
like perfume, can only
call up bitter memories.

249
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,499
- You explained it beautifully, clear.

250
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,916
By the way, I suppose it's
all right to call you dear?

251
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,249
- Yes, of course.

252
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,124
- Eve, dear.

253
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,041
Don't you think you're a bit
young to have had a past?

254
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,791
- You can be disillusioned at any age.

255
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,792
- Poor Eve.

256
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,792
- Listen to me, Nanny.

257
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:26,374
- You listen to me, madam.

258
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,207
- All writers are temperamental sometimes.

259
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,332
He didn't mean it.

260
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,791
I think you are being very unreasonable.

261
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:34,375
Unreasonable?

262
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:43,250
- You see? That's what happens
when we lose our temper.

263
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,874
- Well, it should work all right now.

264
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,208
- Thanks, darling, dear. That's fine.

265
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:55,707
- What ever is the matter?

266
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,332
- That woman.
- Oh dear.

267
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,207
- Honest, I wouldn't
have that old so-and-so

268
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,082
as a Nanny if I were paid to.

269
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,791
- Would you like me to
type of description of her?

270
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,832
- What on Earth for?

271
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,125
- I now I have my full
alphabet working again.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
- Little darlings. What's the matter here?

273
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,374
I'm afraid I don't quite-

274
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,250
- Oh, dear.

275
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,167
- Come in.

276
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,416
- Sorry to bother you Nanny,
but Elizabeth's crying.

277
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,417
- Let them.

278
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,249
- Oh, Nanny you're not leaving?

279
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,499
-|am.

280
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,999
Unless Mrs. Banning gives
that Pennant man notice to go.

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,332
- I don't think you should

282
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,916
speak about Mr. Pennant like that.

283
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:36,875
- Why not, pray?

284
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:39,249
He's only a paying guest
here, same as yourself.

285
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,291
- Here you are. Listen to this.

286
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,582
You're always saying I
can't write dialogue.

287
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,416
Men don't understand.

288
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,249
But for women some words,
sweet enough in themselves,

289
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,083
like perfume, can only
call up bitter memories.

290
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,832
There. Has that got feeling, or hasn't?

291
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,957
- It's beautiful darling.

292
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,832
But, would anybody talk like that?

293
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,082
- You don't think they would?

294
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,041
- Well, I may be wrong darling. But no.

295
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,291
No, I don't think they would.

296
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,541
- Well, your are wrong, darling.

297
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,542
As a matter of fact, those very words

298
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,707
were spoken in this room
only a few minutes ago.

299
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,542
- Who by?

300
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,375
- By Eve.

301
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,999
- Poor Eve. Mind you,
I'm very fond of Eve.

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,791
I'm very sorry her for her, but-

303
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,416
- But. Now comes the catty bit.

304
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,791
- Not catty at all.

305
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,291
I was only going to say
she must forget this man,

306
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:30,042
whoever he was, sometime, and
look around for someone else.

307
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,082
- That's what you'd do in her place?

308
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,083
- Yes, I would.

309
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:33,958
- Well, I'm sure you would.

310
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,875
You'd start picking over the possibles

311
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,791
before I was cold in my grave.

312
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:37,999
- You are cruel.

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,332
- And you, on the other hand, are shadow.

314
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,791
Although you've left the
stage for over three years,

315
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,124
you still can't resist putting on an act,

316
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,374
even though it's for an audience of one.

317
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,749
- The trouble with you, is
you can't stand criticism.

318
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,291
- Well, of course I can.

319
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,207
But it's a bit galling when
you immediately pour cold water

320
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,207
on the best bit of dialogue
I've produced for weeks.

321
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,416
- You didn't produce it, Eve did.

322
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:55,541
- But I recognised its merit.
Which is more than you did.

323
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,832
- Whenever I say what
you write is wonderful,

324
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,667
I'm a good critic.

325
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,207
If I criticise, I don't
know anything about it.

326
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,999
- All right, then. I shan't
write the flaming thing at all.

327
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll write a story about a wife

328
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,041
who tries to help her husband,
and who doesn't natter.

329
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,417
That will be something new.

330
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,416
May I ask what my hat was
doing on the draining board?

331
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,250
- If you want to know,

332
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,999
I was trying to get that
ink stain out with milk.

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,833
- Thank you.

334
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,500
All that remains now is to get
the milk stain out with ink.

335
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,083
- Hello, Mary.

336
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,124
What are staring at?

337
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,082
- I'm always fascinated by wasted energy.

338
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,292
Of course there's no harm in

339
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:11,624
relieving your feelings, so long as-

340
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,458
- So long as what?

341
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,666
- So long as you're not enjoying it.

342
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,041
- No jolly good, but they've begun to.

343
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,000
- It's a little difficult
to be sympathetic

344
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,207
every time you and Rodney have a row.

345
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,291
- How'd you know we've had a row'?

346
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,082
- I met him as I came
in. He was muttering.

347
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,375
- When he mutters, I could.

348
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,457
Mary, do you think it's my fault

349
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,957
we have all these squabbles?

350
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,166
- It's the fault of both of you.

351
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,207
- Thank you, darling.

352
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,874
You know what I think it is?

353
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,791
It's been together 24 hours a day.

354
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,124
If only Rodney could get
a room out to work in.

355
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,041
- I know. I wish we had another room.

356
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,374
- Oh darling, don't think I'm ungrateful.

357
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,041
You couldn't have done
more, to be my sister.

358
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,375
- Probably have done less.

359
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,124
- How can a romance and marriage

360
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,291
survive the sort of life we lead?

361
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,582
- Personally, I never deluded myself

362
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,332
you could take romance into marriage.

363
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,791
Wings are to fly with, not walk with.

364
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,041
Do like tinned fish balls?

365
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,749
No, nor do I. But fish
balls it'll have to be.

366
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,957
- That's the sort of thing

367
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,624
that takes the magic out of marriage.

368
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,832
- You can't live forever

369
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,416
on a diet of wedding cake, you know?

370
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,457
- It's terribly important to
keep the romantic side alive.

371
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,874
Whenever I feel Rodney and I
drifting apart, I think back.

372
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:22,082
I compare us as we are, with what we were.

373
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:22,958
Makes me want to cry.

374
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,999
Do you ever think back to when
Bruce fell in love with you?

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,291
- Of course. Afraid it
makes me want to laugh.

376
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,292
- That's just the difference between us.

377
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:31,958
- Darling, I couldn't bear

378
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,792
to see you start peeling your fingers.

379
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,499
- You see, our meeting was so romantic.

380
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,249
He came to the theatre one
night to see the play I was in

381
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,541
and fell in love with me at sight.

382
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,999
I didn't know. I only had a tiny part.

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,833
- Perhaps that was why.

384
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:49,416
- He came every night for fortnight,

385
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,457
loving me more and more.

386
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,874
He started in row M, and
finished up in row A.

387
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,874
If that isn't romance.

388
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,082
- Hello?

389
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,291
No, it's Mary. Do you want to talk to her?

390
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,125
It's Rodney.

391
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,874
- Tell him I'm lying down.

392
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,124
She's lying down.

393
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,916
- What did he say?

394
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,749
- He says he only believes
the lying part of it.

395
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,958
He wants to talk to you.

396
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,750
- Yes?

397
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,791
Yes, Rodney I know you.

398
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,166
You saying that because you've had

399
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,792
a few drinks, or do you mean it?

400
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,124
Oh, darling. What?

401
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,457
Wait a minute. I'll ask Mary.

402
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,291
Mary, do you think you could
cope if I went out to dinner?

403
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,125
- Yes.

404
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:42,666
- Oh. Bless you, darling.

405
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:46,458
Yes, it's all right. Savoy? Heavenly.

406
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,125
Bye, darling.

407
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,791
Oh, Mary. Thanks awfully.

408
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:02,875
You must say for Rodney, he
does know how to apologise.

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,666
Hello, Bruce.

410
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,000
- What on Earth?

411
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,749
What she is so excited about?

412
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,791
- Hello, darling. She's
going out to dinner.

413
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:20,625
- Who with?

414
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:21,749
- Rodney.

415
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,832
- Oh, another row. Who's fault this time?

416
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,999
- I don't know. They both
behave like a couple of kids.

417
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,791
I suppose it is being together
all day, as Sabina said.

418
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:30,957
Oh, we're quite glad to see each other

419
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,625
at the end of the day, aren't we?

420
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,042
Well, I gave you the opening.

421
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,207
- Oh, I don't have to tell
you I'm glad to see you.

422
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,957
- No, but it'd be rather nice if you did.

423
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,166
All the same, there is
something in what Sabina says.

424
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,167
I doubt if we could survive,

425
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:48,416
living in the same room
all day and everyday.

426
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,707
- Nonsense. It's a completely
fallacious argument.

427
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,207
According to Sabina, we'd be glad to still

428
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,374
see each other at the end of the week.

429
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,999
It's a pity one of us
doesn't live in Rhodesia.

430
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,833
Think how glad we should be

431
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:58,874
to see each other at the end of the year.

432
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,957
If you follow the thing
to is logical conclusions,

433
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,124
the only way to be happily
married is to live apart.

434
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,624
- It very often is.

435
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,791
- Oh, by the way.
- Thank you.

436
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,750
- Do you want to eat in or out?

437
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,582
- Well, I don't want to go
out. I've only just come in.

438
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,082
- Well in that case, it'll
have to be out of a tin.

439
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:11,917
- There you are.

440
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,791
That's what our civilization
has brought us to,

441
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,999
baked beans, canned food,
canned music, potted psychology.

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,833
It makes me sick.

443
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,499
- Dear old reactionary, aren't you?

444
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,999
You should lived 100 years ago.

445
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,250
- Yes, I wish I had.

446
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,375
Do you know on my present income,

447
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:28,041
I could have had a large
house in the country?

448
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,291
We could have kept horses and servants,

449
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,999
had wine to drink, and meat to eat.

450
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,957
We could have sat under
the cedars on the lawn

451
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,457
and played with our six children.

452
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,207
- Oh? You'd have had six children?

453
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,042
Certainly.

454
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:40,249
- Not with this wife, you wouldn't.

455
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,916
- Oh, with a hearty buxom wife

456
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,582
who'd adore me and the children,

457
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,832
who'd spend her time between
the kitchen and the dairy,

458
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,667
and the nursery and the garden.

459
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,625
- What a revolting picture.

460
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,458
- For who?
- Me.

461
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,957
- May I point out that
she wouldn't be you,

462
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,707
and therefore she might enjoy it?

463
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,207
Which reminds me of you been
up to see Elizabeth yet?

464
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,999
- No, I expect she's asleep.

465
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,917
- She may be dead.

466
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,208
- No. Nanny would have told me.

467
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,457
- I wonder if I can find a taxi.

468
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:09,292
- Take a bus.

469
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:11,457
- Don't be silly. In this dress?

470
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,333
Oh.

471
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,875
Do you like it?

472
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,666
- No, I prefer you in dungarees.

473
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,542
Attractive women shouldn't
need artificial aids to beauty.

474
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,292
- Do you think I'm attractive?

475
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:54,207
- That was a generalisation,
and not to be taken personally.

476
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,666
- It's Victor. He's brought the screen.

477
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:06,667
- Oh no.

478
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:11,957
- Hello, Victor.

479
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,874
- Hello, darling. I'm as
good as my word, you see.

480
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,874
Come and give me a hand, old man.

481
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,708
You're an absolute angel.

482
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,999
- I wouldn't say that.

483
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,249
- Evening, Manifold.

484
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,625
- Evening, Banning, old boy.

485
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,750
Ha ha.

486
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,332
- I told Rodney you were
bringing the screen.

487
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,333
He was awfully glad.

488
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,208
- I beg your pardon, sir.

489
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:57,666
- On Earths Banning up to,
extraordinary fella. I don't know.

490
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,291
Come on Banning, old chap.

491
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:02,332
Now, where would you like it, darling?

492
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,167
- Over here I think.

493
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,457
No, I think over there would be better.

494
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,957
- Over there, old man.

495
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,542
Be careful with it.

496
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,874
- Oh Victor, it's lovely.

497
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,957
- And so are you, if I may say so.

498
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,916
- Thank you, darling. I'm
just going out to dinner.

499
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,791
In fact I should be there now,
if only I could find a taxi.

500
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,207
- Oh, don't worry about taxis.

501
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,957
I'll drive you anywhere you want to go.

502
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,041
- I feel like a wash.

503
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,374
- Well, what's the matter?

504
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,792
- Nothing. Just I feel like a wash.

505
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,125
- Pull.

506
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,791
- Whiskey.

507
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,624
Victor, where on Earth did you get it?

508
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,458
- Don't ask silly questions, darling.

509
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,332
Let's have a drink before we go.

510
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:53,332
- I hate to be inhospitable,
but I'm late already.

511
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:55,249
- Well, you can't refuse me
a drink of my own whiskey.

512
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,874
- Oh, darling. Of course have a drink.

513
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,499
No, no no. Not for me, thank you.

514
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,416
- Are you sure?

515
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,957
Wherever have you got to be, and when?

516
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,332
- The Savoy, five minutes ago.

517
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,167
- And who is giving the party?

518
00:26:04,168 --> 00:26:07,042
- There's no party.
I'm dining with Rodney.

519
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,083
- Well, then we needn't hurry.

520
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,125
- Come in.

521
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,042
Nanny, I wonder if you'd mind.

522
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:20,958
Oh Nanny, no.

523
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,292
- Time for another?

524
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,999
- Well, there wasn't
really time for that one.

525
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,624
- Don't worry, darling.

526
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,708
Husband's will always wait, unfortunately.

527
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,083
- Excuse me.

528
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:38,875
Not off yet?

529
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:42,541
- No, just going. Had a nice wash?

530
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,166
- No, the water was stone cold,

531
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,249
the towels were sopping wet,
and there wasn't any soap.

532
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,332
- Oh, Bruce I'm terribly sorry.

533
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,707
But the chemistry only had
that awful antiseptic stuff-

534
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,124
- You like Chanel's Gardenia?

535
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,125
I can get you as much as you want.

536
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:56,207
- Oh, Victor can you? Heavenly.

537
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:59,457
Mary, Victor says he can
get us some Chanel Gardenia.

538
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,292
- It would be more to the point

539
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:02,166
if he could get us a new nanny.

540
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,833
- Oh, Mary. She isn't leaving?

541
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,999
Oh, and I did everything I
could to smooth her down.

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,499
- You didn't succeed.

543
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,749
- I'm terribly sorry.

544
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,583
-So am I.

545
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:12,166
- Oh dear.

546
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,500
Well I suppose I'd better not go out now.

547
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,541
Nonsense. Of course you must go.

548
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:19,041
Rodney is waiting for you.

549
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:20,999
- Well, if you're sure it's all right.

550
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,333
We may as well go then.

551
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,999
- Goodbye.

552
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,625
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

553
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,457
- Oh, unwholesome type.

554
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:31,292
- Victor?

555
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:32,832
- Yeah. Chanel, Gardenia.

556
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,499
What's the matter with Wright's Coal Tar?

557
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,707
- Nothing, darling.

558
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:36,749
If you like Wright's Coal Tar,

559
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,207
I'll give you a cake for your birthday.

560
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:42,083
- I require some assistance
with my trunk, Mr. Banning.

561
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:55,500
- Hey, what's this for?

562
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
- The whiskey.

563
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,499
- Don't be silly. I meant it as a present.

564
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,374
- I'm thinking what Rodney would think.

565
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,666
- That I had designs on you?

566
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,082
Just because I give you
two bottles of whiskey?

567
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,499
- Two bottles of whiskey.

568
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,124
He'd probably think you're
designs had succeeded.

569
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,166
- Then he's a poor psychologist.

570
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,000
- Why?

571
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,749
- Well if they had, it'd
be one bottle, not two.

572
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,166
- All the same, I prefer to pay for it.

573
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:15,291
- All right, if you insist.

574
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:16,125
Does this entitle me

575
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:17,332
to make love to you
with a clear conscience?

576
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,417
- No, darling.

577
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,832
Oh, Victor. I don't play fair, do I?

578
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,541
I let you help me, and do things for me

579
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,624
while Rodney was away and I didn't-

580
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,791
- I didn't expect you to.

581
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,082
You're not the sort of
woman to be unfaithful

582
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,666
to her husband behind his back.

583
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,082
- Thank you, darling.

584
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,963
- That's why I was so
pleased when he came home.

585
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:54,291
- Well, the old battleship
has steamed off.

586
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:55,957
Where do we go from here?

587
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,167
- Find another one, if
it's humanly possible.

588
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,957
- I suppose you wouldn't consider

589
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,416
looking after Elizabeth
yourself, would you?

590
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,833
- What about my job?

591
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,374
- Oh yes, your job.

592
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,707
- Tails.

593
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:30,416
- Happy. Darling?

594
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,832
- Oh, blissfully.

595
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:32,667
But you know, darling,

596
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:35,291
it's not so much the
champaign and the music,

597
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:36,916
or the glamour and excitement.

598
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:37,750
- I know, darling.

599
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:39,291
It's being with the one
person who really matters.

600
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:42,582
- It's knowing somebody
else will do the washing up.

601
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,416
- Well, you might wait
until I've finished.

602
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,624
Hey, where's my fountain pen?

603
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,707
- On the dresser.

604
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,374
I borrowed it to write out
an advertisement for a nanny.

605
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,457
- You've been advertising every day

606
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,178
for a fortnight, without
a single reply yet.

607
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,291
- Oh, Valentine stop teasing Elizabeth.

608
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,041
- Where is it? I can't see it.

609
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:38,917
- Excuse me, old man.

610
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:40,499
- Oh, morning.
- There there, there there.

611
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,874
- I wish you wouldn't borrow my things.

612
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,207
Nothing belongs to me in this house.

613
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,291
Why can't I have things of our own?

614
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,707
- Stop that, won't you?

615
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,916
- What's the matter with you?

616
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,207
- Oh Sabina don't. Please don't.

617
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:53,041
- I'm sorry Bruce. I didn't
mean to shout at you.

618
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:53,875
- Of course you didn't.

619
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:55,291
You're just a bit on edge, that's all.

620
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,999
Looking after Elizabeth
as well as Valentine

621
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,207
is obviously too much for you.

622
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,042
- No, it's not the children.

623
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:00,916
It's trying to cook, and clean,

624
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,707
and wash up all at the same time.

625
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,542
- Yes, I know.

626
00:31:03,543 --> 00:31:05,041
You know, Mary aught to give up her job,

627
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:06,042
and do her share of the work.

628
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:08,582
- I suppose you're being
pretty tough on her.

629
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,583
- Well, it's obvious
something has to be done.

630
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,832
We can't go on as we
are. The result's chaos.

631
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,457
- What do you mean, chaos?

632
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:14,292
- Precisely what I say.

633
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:17,041
I mean meals late, everything anyhow.

634
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,832
- Hardly anything is anyhow.

635
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:19,999
- What about lunch yesterday?

636
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,833
What about it?

637
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:21,708
- What time did we eventually have it?

638
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:22,625
- Half past one.

639
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,416
- Half past one? Try for two.

640
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,583
- Can I help it if the clock stopped?

641
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:28,542
Oh, haven't you gone yet?

642
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:29,791
- I'm taking the day off.

643
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,249
I'm determined to find a nanny today,

644
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,374
or perish in the attempt.

645
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,999
- Do you really think there's any hope?

646
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,207
I mean we've tried every
employment agency in London.

647
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,416
- Who said anything about
employment agencies?

648
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:45,417
Your hat, sir. Your hat, sir.

649
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,457
- Oh, what a little
darling. How old is she?

650
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:00,999
- It's a he.

651
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,667
- He really is a lovely child.

652
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,124
- You can have him.

653
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:06,958
- Why, what do you mean?

654
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,875
- What I said.

655
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,374
- Oh, forgive me but, well it seems

656
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,249
that you're not quite
happy in your present post.

657
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,791
If you're considering making a change-

658
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,249
- I certainly am.

659
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,666
- Well, as it happens I'm
looking for a new nanny.

660
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,792
- Well, don't look at me.
I'm going to join the police.

661
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,916
- Stop following me, young woman.

662
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:26,166
Or I'll call the park keep
and give you in charge.

663
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,000
- But Nanny, I'm simply

664
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:29,291
putting a business proposition to you.

665
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,166
- I've heard about girls
being tempted by strangers

666
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,957
with promises of high
wages and an easy life.

667
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,832
How many of them have
ever been seen again?

668
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,500
- Good afternoon.

669
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,581
Please don't think me
impertinent, but I'm desperate-

670
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,680
I suppose you couldn't help me? I'm tying-

671
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,565
You don't happen to know of anybody-

672
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,666
- Lovely afternoon, isn't it'?

673
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:48,500
- Lovely.

674
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:51,041
- Does me good to watch little
ones enjoying themselves.

675
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:52,999
Just look at them. Bless
their little hearts.

676
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,249
- Bless them.

677
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,041
- I come here every afternoon.

678
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:57,374
Of course I'm retired now,

679
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,832
but somehow I'm not happy
without children around me.

680
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:03,333
Once a nanny, always a nanny, I suppose.

681
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,457
Excuse me, my dear.

682
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,583
But are you feeling quite all right?

683
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,916
♪ Bah bah black sheep have you any wool ♪

684
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:16,707
♪ Yes sir yes sir three bags full ♪

685
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,999
♪ One for the master one for the dame ♪

686
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,082
♪ One for the boy on the lane ♪

687
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:24,917
- No good?

688
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:25,750
- NO-

689
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:29,042
- Well, you go to sleep, you
rascal. Good night you, then.

690
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,083
What's all the fuss about, huh?

691
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,166
Hey. Steady on, darling.
What's the matter?

692
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:58,000
- Oh Rodney, it was awful.

693
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:59,416
- Awful?
- A man.

694
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:00,250
- A man?

695
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:02,457
- Who followed me all
the way from the tube.

696
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,499
When I walked faster, he'd walk fast.

697
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,666
And finally I ran.

698
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:09,332
- There there, darling.
You'll get over it.

699
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,624
Look, why don't you run upstairs
and lie down a little bit.

700
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,458
You'll feel better then.

701
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:14,582
- Yes, I think I Will.

702
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,625
- That's a good girl.

703
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,500
Yes, you've had quite a shock.

704
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,750
- By Jove. That girl
Eve can certainly walk.

705
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,624
I've been trying to catch her
up all the way from the tube.

706
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,749
- Well, you frightened her out
of her life, let me tell you.

707
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,499
- Oh, so that was it
was it? Well, well well.

708
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,749
- Don't you realise by now
that to Eve, the entire

709
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,207
male population consists
of Don Juans and Casanovas?

710
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,749
You'd better apologise.

711
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,750
- I wouldn't disillusion
her for the world.

712
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,124
Can I give you a hand,
Sabina? Let me take this.

713
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,332
- Oh, yes. Could you lay the table?

714
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,374
- Yes, of course. You look all in.

715
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,333
- I made the beds yet,

716
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:53,917
and I must get them done
before Mary comes in.

717
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,791
- Dear Sabina, so
delightfully incompetent,

718
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:58,999
a really womanly woman.

719
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,249
- Well, you should thank Heaven for it.

720
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,249
- Not when it comes to
burned rice pudding,

721
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,500
and half cooked potatoes.

722
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,374
- Here, come on. You can
lend a hand with this.

723
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,166
- Yes, if you helped a bit
more with the little things,

724
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,041
you might begin to realise
what Sabina is up against.

725
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,624
- Well, she could do it
if only she'd concentrate.

726
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,666
But she can't.

727
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,916
She's wishing all the time
she was doing something else.

728
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,166
She has a fluffy mind.

729
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,791
- What do you expect? She's a fluffy type.

730
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:19,750
- Is that meant to be offensive?

731
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:21,499
- Oh, not at all but
you should be thankful

732
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,416
to have a thoroughly feminine wife.

733
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,541
There's no modern nonsense about Sabina.

734
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,542
She knows where a woman's place.

735
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:28,582
- Yes, The Savoy.
- Rodney?

736
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,332
Do you know where the aspirins are?

737
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,624
- You'll find them in the
kitchen, in the Sago tin.

738
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,582
- You don't look too bright tonight, Eve.

739
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,249
- No, poor Eve.

740
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,291
She had rather an unpleasant
experience on the way home.

741
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,749
- I was followed by a man.

742
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,999
- Good heavens. What did he look like?

743
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
- Horrible.

744
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,249
I only looked back once but,

745
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,999
he must've been after me cause he waved.

746
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,833
- What a gnome, and impertinent.

747
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:49,749
- That's when I began to run.

748
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,249
Luckily, he was too
old to keep up with me.

749
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,250
- What?

750
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:55,333
- You better sit down, and take it easy.

751
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:58,999
- Where is everybody?

752
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,708
I've got the most wonderful news.

753
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,166
I found a nanny.

754
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,375
- Well done, Mary.

755
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:07,832
The old country can still
muster a nanny in a crisis.

756
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,624
- It's one thing to get on
nanny. It's another to keep her.

757
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,291
- Well, that's what I
want to talk to you about.

758
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,916
If we're going to keep
this one, we must avoid

759
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:14,833
the mistakes we made with the last one.

760
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,166
- What you are leading up to is that

761
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,999
I must never asked her to do
anything for my Valentine.

762
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,207
- Well, that's where we went
wrong before, wasn't it?

763
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,374
She was in our pay, and in the end

764
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,791
she did as much for you as for us.

765
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,666
- Well, this time let's share her salary.

766
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,999
Then she'll be equally ours.

767
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,291
- Well that's not solution, I'm afraid.

768
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,041
The only thing is to try my idea.

769
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,874
- And what is your idea?

770
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:34,957
- Simplicity itself.

771
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:35,958
We just let Nanny think

772
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:38,207
that Valentine and Elizabeth
are brother and sister.

773
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,499
- Mary, what a brainwave.

774
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,666
- Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

775
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:44,875
- If they're going to
be brother and sister,

776
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,542
that would mean they'd have to have

777
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,458
the same father and mother.

778
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,499
- Of course.

779
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,499
- And who do you propose the
father and mother should be?

780
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,791
- Well, as I'm out all day,

781
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:53,457
and the mother should be on the spot,

782
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:55,707
I think it ought to be Rodney and Sabina.

783
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:56,542
- Well, that seems fair enough.

784
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:58,041
What do you say, Bruce?

785
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,499
- What do I say? I say it's
an unnatural arrangement.

786
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,541
Do you seriously expect me to give up

787
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,249
all claim to Elizabeth just like that?

788
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,291
- Well, if you feel so
strongly about it Bruce

789
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:07,291
we could divide the parentage.

790
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,624
You'll be the father,
and I'll be the mother.

791
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,458
- Wouldn't seem a little odd,

792
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:12,499
you and I sleeping in the same room?

793
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,124
- Yes, I suppose it would.

794
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,749
- Well, the whole thing's ridiculous.

795
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,916
- Well, there's no point in arguing Bruce.

796
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:18,457
As a matter of fact,
it's got to be Sabina.

797
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,541
<i>—</i> Why?

798
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:22,124
- Because I tell Nanny it
was for my sister's children.

799
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,124
- So we're going to be sisters, are we?

800
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,332
- Well, it was the only way

801
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,874
I could persuade her to come to us.

802
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,874
She was telling me how happy
she was in her last job

803
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,332
with June Marriott, the actress.

804
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,541
So I said, well my sister was
in a play with June Marriott,

805
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,499
and that just turned the scales.

806
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,624
- Were you in a play with June Marriott?

807
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,374
- Yes, and I loathed her.

808
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,416
- It was probably mutual.

809
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,457
Personally speaking,

810
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,916
I think you did a very clever job, Mary.

811
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:41,750
- Well it's all and well for you.

812
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,583
What do I become, an uncle?

813
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:43,625
- By marriage, dear.

814
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,791
- No, I refuse to accept Rodney
as the father of my child.

815
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,249
- Surely rather Rodney,

816
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,666
than some strange man you didn't know.

817
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,207
- Well, do you agree or don't you?

818
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,042
Because if you don't, I shall just have

819
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:54,958
to ring her up and put
the whole thing off.

820
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,332
- Oh no, Mary. Don't do that.

821
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,874
I'm sure Bruce wouldn't mind being Uncle,

822
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,082
once he gets used to the idea.

823
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,541
After all, it's worth some sacrifice

824
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,374
to keep a nanny for more than a fortnight.

825
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,999
- Bruce, yours.

826
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
- Bruce?

827
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,249
- There you are, my man.

828
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,166
- Here, missus. You can't
carry them heavy bags.

829
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:25,000
I'll give you a hand.

830
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,791
- Oh I can manage, thank you.

831
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:29,124
I'm not in my old age yet, you know?

832
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,499
You wouldn't think I'd been mother

833
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,124
to 45 children, would you?

834
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,125
- Blimey, no.

835
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,083
- It's her.

836
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,249
- Well, let's start off
with a good impression.

837
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,583
She can see you too later.

838
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:44,416
- Is this Mrs. Banning? Oh,
yes. How do you do, Mary dear.

839
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,666
- Good evening, Nanny. Do come in.

840
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,832
- Let me help you.
- Oh, thank you.

841
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,457
- This is my sister, Mrs. Pennant.

842
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,749
- How do you do, madam?

843
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,999
Oh, why you're only a baby
yourself, aren't you dear?

844
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,499
Shall I show you upstairs, Nanny?

845
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,125
You just follow me.

846
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:04,541
- My sister tells me you were
with June Marriott, Nanny.

847
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:07,832
- Yes, a delightful woman.
Not at all like an actress.

848
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:08,667
- Not at all.

849
00:40:08,668 --> 00:40:10,124
- Good mother, and a good wife.

850
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,166
And never a breath of scandal.

851
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,167
- Never a breath.

852
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,332
- This is your room, Nanny.

853
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,624
- What a cosy little nest.

854
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,957
- I do hope you'll be comfortable.

855
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:23,291
- Bless your heart. I shall be
as snug as a bug in the rug.

856
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,499
Now where's my nursery?

857
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,667
I can't wait to see my babies.

858
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,542
- In here, Nanny.

859
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,874
- Well, dear.
- How do you do?

860
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:38,958
- How do you do? Oh, bless his
heart. What lovely manners.

861
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,457
Now what would their ages be?

862
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:42,375
- You mean, how old are they?

863
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:43,541
- Well, that's what I said.

864
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,375
- Elizabeth's two.

865
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:46,542
- And Valentine's two and a half.

866
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:48,874
- Don't be silly, Sabina.
He must be more than that.

867
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,707
- I know how old he is.

868
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,207
Oh, of course I meant that he was

869
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:54,624
two and a half last birthday.

870
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,957
My sister's a
little vague about time.

871
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,749
- Not about daily routine, I hope.

872
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,082
I train my children to my rhythm.

873
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,832
Rhythm is essential to regularity,
and regularity is rhythm.

874
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,874
Getting them up, or sitting them down,

875
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:10,042
the daily timetable must be observed.

876
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,582
Goodness gracious me.

877
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,457
High time that some little people I know

878
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:19,332
are on their way to bed,
before the Sandman gets them.

879
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,875
You can come up and say good night later.

880
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:27,708
Now my pretties, I'm going to
give you a dear little bath y.

881
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:31,541
Oh, Mary. All our worries are over.

882
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:32,458
Sabina.

883
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,958
- Corning, darling.

884
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:43,416
Oh, darling she's an absolute
dream, a treasure, a joy.

885
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,499
I wish you could have seen Valentine.

886
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,791
- Sabina, nanny on no nanny
you know perfectly well

887
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:48,999
I have an important
appointment at seven o'clock.

888
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,999
And I want something to eat.

889
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
- Yes.

890
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,707
Would you rather the potatoes were

891
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:59,457
not quite cooked and the pie just right,

892
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,333
or the pie over cooked and
the potatoes just right?

893
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:04,917
- Yes.

894
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,833
What's the matter?

895
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,417
- The pie.

896
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:31,041
- Oh no, Sabina. Not again.
This is the last straw.

897
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:33,166
- It certainly is the last straw.

898
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:35,291
I come in here ready to apologise,

899
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,749
and you don't give me a chance.

900
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,874
You fly into a temper.

901
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,124
- Well, what do you expect?

902
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:39,958
I have an important meeting before me.

903
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:41,416
And I'm starving, do you hear? Starving.

904
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:43,916
- Well if your starving, then
cut yourself a piece of cake.

905
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:44,875
- I can't, there isn't any.

906
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:45,708
- How do you know?

907
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:46,542
- I had it for tea.

908
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:47,375
- There you are, that proves it.

909
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,208
- It proves what?

910
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:50,874
- You can't have your cake and eat it.

911
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:51,708
- Well, who said I could?

912
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:53,374
- You do. You expect me to be cooking

913
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:54,749
and setting in a nanny.

914
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,499
You want a nanny, don't you?

915
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,832
- It's you who wants a nanny.

916
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,041
I'm beginning to think
the day I married you

917
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,582
was the worst day's work of my life.

918
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,957
- It was the last day's work.

919
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,124
- That's a lie. I work every day.

920
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,332
- Not like I do.

921
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,499
If you don't feel like
writing, you don't write.

922
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,332
How would you feel if I said to you,

923
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,999
there's no dinner, I
didn't feel like cooking?

924
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,750
- Very much as I feel now.

925
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,582
- I believe in the larder, there's some-

926
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:20,000
- No Sabina. I will not
eat cold Semolina pudding.

927
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,124
- Well, how's Nanny getting on?

928
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,874
- She's telling them a bedtime story.

929
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,207
Honestly, the woman's a perfect gem.

930
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:38,292
Why, Sabina.

931
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:41,457
No, better not.

932
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,749
- You know, I'm afraid Sabina's
nerves are in a bad way.

933
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,999
- Nonsense. She's got
no emotional control.

934
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,124
- You're a cold-blooded fish.

935
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,041
- You mean I'm a civilised
adult, I take it.

936
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,457
- Sometimes I wish you
weren't so civilised.

937
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,999
Then perhaps, you might prefer
looking after your own child

938
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,041
to working in a chemical laboratory.

939
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:57,749
- What's really upsetting,
is that I've found a nanny.

940
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,417
You hoped I wouldn't,
didn't you? Didn't you?

941
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,582
Before we were married, remember,

942
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,999
'twas walking down Barkley
Street and you said,

943
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,499
as far as your work is concerned,

944
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,291
I never want you to do
anything you don't want to

945
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,125
because you're married to me.

946
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,125
- But I still don't want you

947
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:12,291
to do anything you don't want to do.

948
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,541
All I want is, that you should want to.

949
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:16,499
Do you see what I mean?

950
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,332
- Suddenly, the old woman
turned into a beautiful fairy,

951
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:23,291
all gowns and gossamer if you please.

952
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,957
And with her wand, whate'er
befalls you, tiny one.

953
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,375
Now go to the ball.

954
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:36,249
Well now, imagine Cinderella's surprise

955
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,957
when her dirty rags turned
into a beautiful golden gown.

956
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:45,166
And on her feet were little
twinkling glass slippers.

957
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:47,916
But, said the fairy,
after the stroke of 12

958
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:50,916
you must not stay or back
to rags you'll change.

959
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:55,332
And so away.

960
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,666
And so Cinderella was whisked off

961
00:44:57,667 --> 00:45:00,916
to the palace in a glittering glass coach.

962
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,541
And as soon as she entered the ballroom,

963
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,499
Prince Charming fell in love with her,

964
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,625
and the ugly sisters were simply furious.

965
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:18,000
All night long, Prince Charming
danced with Cinderella.

966
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:24,292
And they lived happily ever after.

967
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,457
- Oh, I hope dinner's ready.

968
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,208
- So do I. I feel jolly peckish.

969
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,541
- Are you two fondly supposing
you're gonna get some dinner?

970
00:45:39,542 --> 00:45:40,542
- Well, aren't we?

971
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,082
- Oh, Lord. We better eat out, I suppose.

972
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,999
- Well, do you fancy a
sandwich at the local,

973
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,957
or a Welch rabbit at the Old Engel Nook.

974
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,750
- Oh, the local. I feel like a beer.

975
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,374
Eve? We're
going across to the pub.

976
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,666
Will you follow us over?

977
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:56,167
All right.

978
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,166
- What are you all dolled up for?

979
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,874
- For psychological reasons

980
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,832
that you couldn't possibly understand.

981
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,541
You can't imagine the
effect it has on a woman,

982
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:13,499
going a bottle all day
looking like a drab.

983
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,166
Putting on real clothes,
and doing one's face

984
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:19,875
has the effect of, well,
of a champagne supper.

985
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:21,708
- It's a pity I can't get

986
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:24,249
the same effect by changing my trousers.

987
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,332
- Aren't you going to say
you're sorry before you go?

988
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,416
- Say I'm sorry?

989
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:31,041
- For being such a bear.

990
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:32,500
- It's no use, Sabina.

991
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:36,208
- I see.

992
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:38,832
I don't attract you anymore.

993
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,166
- I didn't say that.

994
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:42,083
Look, I must be going. I'm late already.

995
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,375
I said I must be going.

996
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:47,875
I may be late.

997
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,333
So don't wait up for me.

998
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:06,458
- Might I trouble you
for the mustard, please?

999
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,707
- Would you mind changing
places with me, Bruce?

1000
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:14,708
- No, no.

1001
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,874
- May I come in?

1002
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,875
- Victor, how nice to see you.

1003
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,374
- You're looking very
charming this evening.

1004
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,499
You expecting someone?

1005
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,249
- No, I'm all alone. I need cheering up.

1006
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,125
- I'll do my best.

1007
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,374
- But first, you must
help me clear the way.

1008
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,375
- Of course.

1009
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:05,041
Remarkably clean plates and all, huh?

1010
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,124
- Yes aren't they?

1011
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,291
- What's the story behind this?

1012
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:09,499
- I spoiled the supper,
so they've all gone out.

1013
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,666
That's why I'm alone.

1014
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,082
- What about you? Would
you like to come out?

1015
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:12,917
- No thanks.

1016
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:14,999
I'd much rather stay here and talk to you.

1017
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,041
- What should we talk about?

1018
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:20,374
- Oh, life in general. Can
you see any point in it?

1019
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,958
- Not in general, no. But
there are certain moments.

1020
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,207
- Help yourself to a drink.

1021
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,208
- Thank you.

1022
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,208
One for you?

1023
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:48,042
- You know, I rather think I will.

1024
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,166
- Now, tell me what's
been getting you down.

1025
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,666
No, no. On second thought, don't.

1026
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:58,500
- Why not?

1027
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,375
- Well, it won't cheer you up

1028
00:48:59,376 --> 00:49:00,707
to talk about your domestic squabbles.

1029
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:02,958
- Who said anything
about domestic squabbles?

1030
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:06,124
- Darling, you needn't pretend with me.

1031
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:07,457
I can read your every thought.

1032
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,874
- Really? What am I thinking now?

1033
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,582
- You're wondering if it
would relieve your feelings

1034
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,416
to have an affair with me.

1035
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,082
- You're flattering yourself.

1036
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,749
I haven't the slightest intention

1037
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,874
of having an affair with you.

1038
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,624
- Well, have another drink.

1039
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,832
- No thanks.

1040
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,833
- You're now thinking that another drink

1041
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,207
might weaken your resolution.

1042
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,875
- Not at all.

1043
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,708
I'll have another, thank you.

1044
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,916
You seem to have no fears
about your resolution.

1045
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:40,166
- Oh, but I have.

1046
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:41,249
Who wouldn't when sitting next

1047
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,375
to such a charming and desirable woman?

1048
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:47,082
- Do you really think I'm desirable?

1049
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,999
Or are you just being polite?

1050
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,624
- I think any unattainable
woman's desirable.

1051
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,041
The trouble is so few are.

1052
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:55,416
- The trouble with you is
you've known too many women.

1053
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,541
Probably all of the wrong sort.

1054
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:59,916
- They always are, in retrospect.
What a comfort that is.

1055
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:02,957
- A love affair with you is
like a bad cold, something to be

1056
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,124
got out of your system
as quickly as possible.

1057
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,374
- Exactly.

1058
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,041
- I could never love like that,

1059
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,124
thinking it all out beforehand.

1060
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:15,499
If I love, I want to throw
everything to the wind.

1061
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,249
- Not your Benedictine too, my sweet.

1062
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,250
- No, darling.

1063
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:20,542
Thank you, darling.

1064
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:24,416
I only knew I'm terribly unhappy.

1065
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:28,707
And nobody can help me,
nobody. Nobody knows.

1066
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:29,542
- Nobody knows what?

1067
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:30,832
- I don't know.

1068
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:31,833
- Darling.

1069
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:33,957
Don't let's speak, don't let's move.

1070
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:34,792
- Why?

1071
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:35,625
- This is the climax.

1072
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:36,500
This is a moment that always comes,

1073
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:39,124
when the unattainable becomes attainable,

1074
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:41,124
when one knows that one can.

1075
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,249
But one doesn't.

1076
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,916
It's then that men feel Godlike.

1077
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:45,416
- I don't feel a bit Godlike.

1078
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,832
- Sabina, darling-

1079
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:49,791
- No, go away. It's too late now.

1080
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:50,625
- How like a woman.

1081
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:51,957
You don't like it when I don't kiss you.

1082
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,249
And when I try to, you won't let me.

1083
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,083
What do you want?

1084
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,249
- I'm wanting you to kiss me
because you couldn't help it.

1085
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,250
- Well, I Will.

1086
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:58,374
- No, you can't now.

1087
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:00,833
You've been helping it
for the last five minutes.

1088
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
- Oh.

1089
00:51:30,917 --> 00:51:32,582
- Hello, Bruce.
- Hello.

1090
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:33,832
- Evening, Banning.

1091
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:34,833
- Evening.

1092
00:51:37,042 --> 00:51:39,000
Mary and Eve have gone to the pictures.

1093
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:42,833
- You were telling me where
to get pickled walnuts.

1094
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,874
- Oh yes, yes. I must take
you down there sometime.

1095
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,042
Do.

1096
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:52,500
- Well, there doesn't seem
much more I can do here.

1097
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,250
Goodbye, Sabina.

1098
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:56,707
- Thank you for helping
me to clear it away.

1099
00:51:58,667 --> 00:51:59,750
- Goodnight, old boy.

1100
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,542
- Is it cold out?

1101
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:13,166
- Yes. One notices the
contrast, coming in.

1102
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,167
Meaning?

1103
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,874
- Sabina.
- What?

1104
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,999
- Well, I know it's none of my business.

1105
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,332
- Then shut up.

1106
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:22,832
- Telling you where to
get pickled walnuts.

1107
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:26,082
- He was. Don't you believe me?

1108
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,416
- I don't know. If you would say so.

1109
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:29,832
But it was the most extraordinary attitude

1110
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:30,667
I've ever seen a person take up

1111
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:32,582
to tell another person where
to get pickled walnuts.

1112
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,832
- Are you in the habit of seeing people

1113
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:36,749
tell other people where
to get pickled walnuts?

1114
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,124
- Yes, I've seen a lot of people

1115
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,791
tell other people where to get things,

1116
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:41,124
and not only pickled walnuts, either.

1117
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:44,208
- Oh, it's impossible
to make you understand.

1118
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,874
- I understand well enough.

1119
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,291
You've had no supper,
and too much to drink.

1120
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:51,624
- Nonsense. I've only had two tiny ones.

1121
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,416
- Well, if got that far on two,

1122
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:54,417
where would you have got on three?

1123
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:56,624
- Thanks to you, we shall never know.

1124
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:57,957
- Oh.

1125
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:58,999
And you're all such a simpleton.

1126
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,124
You don't think Victor's serious, do you?

1127
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,374
Why, if you ever told him you were gonna

1128
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:03,457
leave Rodney and go away with him,

1129
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:04,749
he'd be out of that door
like greased lightning.

1130
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,625
- I have not the lightest intention

1131
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:08,416
of leaving Rodney, and Victor knows it.

1132
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:09,582
- Oh, I see.

1133
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,417
Just a nice little intrigue

1134
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:12,166
to while away the lonely evenings.

1135
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,000
Very pretty.

1136
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,833
- Oh, for Heaven's sakes

1137
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:15,707
stop bating me with your superior head.

1138
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:19,124
I'm fed up with marriage.
Rodney doesn't appreciate me.

1139
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:23,249
Nobody appreciates me. I wish I were dead.

1140
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,832
- Oh, Sabina. You're so kind hearted.

1141
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:28,750
Well, I'm very grateful.

1142
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,166
- Now now, please listen Sabina.

1143
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:35,541
I've said all the nasty things about you.

1144
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:37,541
It's only fair to say the nice things too.

1145
00:53:37,542 --> 00:53:40,541
- You're going to have a job
to think them up, aren't you?

1146
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:41,375
- Not at all.

1147
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:43,041
I was telling Rodney only
this evening that he should

1148
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:45,292
thank Heaven you're the
sort of woman you are.

1149
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:51,249
- Oh, Bruce were you? Do tell me why.

1150
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,082
- Well, you'll have all
the womanly qualities.

1151
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,916
You're human and warmhearted.

1152
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:57,749
And what's more, you've got guts.

1153
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,916
You had the courage to
give up your profession,

1154
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:01,166
and take on a job you hate,

1155
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:03,707
because you wanted to
be a wife to your man.

1156
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,708
- Yes.

1157
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:09,291
I don't know why you've bothered
to talk to me like this.

1158
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:12,874
- Well, I know you're not the
sort of woman to behave like.

1159
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,708
Well, that's what upset me.

1160
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,166
- No, you're quite right.

1161
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:18,832
I did behave like, what you didn't say.

1162
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,124
I wanted to satisfy my vanity.

1163
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,624
I wanted to kick that every
woman gets out of knowing

1164
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:25,750
she can still make somebody want her.

1165
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,832
Now, I suppose you
despise me more than ever.

1166
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,458
- Oh, it's a very human weakness.

1167
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,583
- You've been very sweet to me.

1168
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,832
- Not at all. Rodney is my friend.

1169
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,582
- Of course.

1170
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,957
I like very much, Bruce.

1171
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,082
- I like you too.

1172
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:46,291
- And because I like you so much,

1173
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:48,499
I'll try and live up to
your good opinion of me.

1174
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,333
- Oh, thank you.

1175
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:51,666
And will you promise me not
to go around kissing men

1176
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:52,999
just to get the kick out of it.

1177
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,833
- I can try.

1178
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:55,832
- And the next time you're
faced with temptation,

1179
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:58,624
will you count up to five and think of me.

1180
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:02,583
Like this. One, two, three, four,

1181
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,083
five.

1182
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:08,167
What then?

1183
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:11,250
- By then the danger should have passed.

1184
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,667
- It hasn't.

1185
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:18,749
- Sabina, you promised!

1186
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,749
- To think about you, and I did.

1187
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,416
And now I shan't be able to think about

1188
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:23,541
anything else forever and ever.

1189
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:24,791
- But this is terrible.

1190
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:27,874
- What's terrible about it? It's Heaven.

1191
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:30,250
Now, you kiss me.

1192
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,457
- Excuse me, madam.

1193
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:44,000
I've made you and your
husband a nice cup of cocoa.

1194
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,624
- Rodney.

1195
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,499
- Rodney! No, Rodney come back, old chap.

1196
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,041
It isn't what you think at all.

1197
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:08,042
Oh, Rodney.

1198
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:10,499
No, Rodney come back, old chap.

1199
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,416
It isn't what you think at all.

1200
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:13,917
Rodney, come back.

1201
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,208
- Oh, darling. It's no use.

1202
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:22,291
It's no use, he's gone.

1203
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:24,374
Oh Bruce, what are we going to do?

1204
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:26,749
- Well, there's nothing we can do now.

1205
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,957
Nevermind, Sabina.

1206
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:30,082
I'll go to Rodney first thing
in the morning and I'll,

1207
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:32,416
I'll tell him exactly how it all happened.

1208
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:33,707
I hope he'll understand.

1209
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,125
- Oh, I hope he will.

1210
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,875
But what about Mary?

1211
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:42,499
- Oh. Oh yes, Mary.

1212
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,375
Look, Sabina.

1213
00:56:43,376 --> 00:56:44,416
Hadn't we better get out of the way quick,

1214
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:45,250
before she comes in?

1215
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:46,416
- Yes, I couldn't face her now.

1216
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:49,499
Yes. Yes, we'll tell her in the morning.

1217
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,500
- Yes.

1218
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,250
Steady.

1219
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:02,958
Well,

1220
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:04,957
goodnight, Sabina.

1221
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:05,958
- Goodnight, Bruce.

1222
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:13,792
- That's right, madam.

1223
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:16,583
We must see that he gets his
beauty sleep, mustn't we?

1224
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:25,749
- Goodnight, Sabina.

1225
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,333
- Goodnight, Bruce.

1226
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,082
- Shan't be a moment,
darling. Goodnight, Nanny.

1227
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,499
- Pleasant dreams, sir.

1228
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,500
- Thank you.

1229
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:10,041
- I'm going to do my exercises.
It's a lovely morning.

1230
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,792
Arms up, up. Arms out.

1231
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:23,958
Arms up, arms up. That's right.

1232
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:29,708
One, two. One, two. Now,
forward. Bend, forward.

1233
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:33,541
Oh, I think that's
enough for this morning.

1234
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:35,582
Now, my darling you can go and play.

1235
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,333
I must go and wake mommy and daddy.

1236
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,208
Oh, there now madam.

1237
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:10,957
And I was just going to bring
you up a nice cup of tea.

1238
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,207
- Oh, Nanny. How very kind of you.

1239
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:14,999
But you mustn't spoil us.

1240
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,207
- Now, I'll make haste,

1241
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:17,541
and make your husband
his 'fore he gets up.

1242
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,374
He is up, I'm afraid.

1243
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:21,624
We're not used to all this attention.

1244
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,666
- You are early risers.

1245
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:24,625
- Morning, Eve.

1246
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:25,583
- Morning.

1247
00:59:25,584 --> 00:59:27,499
I thought I'd get my
tray and go back to bed.

1248
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,541
Yes, do.

1249
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,291
Nanny, this is Eve.

1250
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:32,207
- How do you do, dear. Another sister?

1251
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,041
- No, just a friend.

1252
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:35,499
- Well, you run back to bed, dear.

1253
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,957
I'll bring you up some breakfast.

1254
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:37,792
- Oh, thanks all.

1255
00:59:37,793 --> 00:59:39,624
- Really Nanny, I can't have you

1256
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:41,624
running up and down all those stairs.

1257
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:44,082
Well, the first time the
stairs began to bother me,

1258
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:46,042
I'll know it's time I retired for good.

1259
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:03,458
What on Earth are you doing?

1260
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:06,541
- Just going down to breakfast, darling.

1261
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:08,291
- But it's Sunday.

1262
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:09,208
Good heavens, is it?

1263
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:10,416
- Yes.

1264
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:11,874
And if you thought it wasn't Sunday,

1265
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,667
what are you doing in those clothes?

1266
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:16,792
- Can't imagine, darling.

1267
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:18,541
Nor can I.

1268
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:21,875
- Well, not that I'm up
I might as well stay up.

1269
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:29,375
Wait a minute, I think
I've forgotten something.

1270
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:32,125
- You've forgotten it's Sunday.

1271
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,042
- Oh yes. That was it.

1272
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,166
You're behaving
very oddly this morning.

1273
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:41,333
- Yes, darling. I know.

1274
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,833
I mean, am I?

1275
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,333
- Oh he did, did he?

1276
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:53,666
Thank you very much. That's
all I wanted to know.

1277
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:58,124
No, no message. And
please don't say I called.

1278
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,125
Goodbye.

1279
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,250
- Good morning, Sabina.

1280
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:03,249
- Oh, Bruce. Thank heavens you're up.

1281
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,832
It's been all I could do to prevent Nanny

1282
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:06,916
from taking up the cups of
tea to everybody in the house.

1283
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:08,624
- Well, I got up as soon as I woke.

1284
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,707
Mary thought it very odd.

1285
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,708
- Have you told her?

1286
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,582
- Oh no, no before breakfast isn't

1287
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:14,957
a very good time to tell Mary things.

1288
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:15,999
- Well, you better hurry up.

1289
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,124
- Oh, dear. Isn't life difficult?

1290
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:20,166
- Poor darling, I suppose you're

1291
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:21,457
still worrying about Rodney.

1292
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:22,292
- No, I'm not.

1293
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,167
I've just telephoned his club,

1294
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:24,999
and they say he spent the night there.

1295
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,749
I expect he'll be home any minute now.

1296
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,249
- Well nevermind, Sabina.
I'll stand by you.

1297
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,499
- Oh, Bruce.

1298
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,457
It's such a comfort to
have a real man to turn to.

1299
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,082
- I rather find it a comfort

1300
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,666
to have a real woman to turn to me.

1301
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,332
- Now now, you love birds.

1302
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:42,583
- Thank you, Nanny. Coffee.

1303
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:49,125
- If only we could sit like this forever.

1304
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:52,207
- Will somebody please tell me why you two

1305
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,957
are sitting there like a
couple of babes in the woods?

1306
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:55,291
- Well you see, Mary, the whole-

1307
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:56,541
- Here's the toast.
- Ah, toast.

1308
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:58,916
- Good morning, Nanny.

1309
01:01:58,917 --> 01:01:59,957
- Perhaps Daddy will come up and have

1310
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:01,999
a little game with his
chicks after breakie.

1311
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,457
- Right after breakie, Nanny. Yes.

1312
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:05,375
- Oh, let me dear.

1313
01:02:05,376 --> 01:02:06,457
- Well?

1314
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:08,707
- Well, you see Mary, it's
rather difficult to explain.

1315
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:10,291
But Nanny's got to get into her head

1316
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,832
that Bruce is married to me.

1317
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,791
- That was clear even to my dull mind.

1318
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:14,957
What I want to know is why?

1319
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:17,124
- Well, you see Mary,
something happened last night.

1320
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,374
- No Mary, no no no,
nothing happened, only-

1321
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:21,082
- Nanny came in and found us in well,

1322
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,791
what's called a compromising situation.

1323
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:25,416
- It wasn't planned, Mary.
You must believe that.

1324
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:27,124
It took us both completely
by surprise, didn't it?

1325
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:29,916
- Completely. One moment
everything was normal.

1326
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,999
And then suddenly
everything was upside down.

1327
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,457
- Are you telling each other, or me?

1328
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,291
- It was my fault, Mary.

1329
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:37,374
I was crying and Bruce was sorry for me.

1330
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:40,999
And then so sweet to me,
that I forgot myself.

1331
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,457
- Oh, I forgot myself too, don't forget.

1332
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,332
- But I forgot myself first.

1333
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:47,207
In a flash, Mary, I
realised that you and I

1334
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:49,292
should have married each other's husbands.

1335
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:56,124
Oh Mary, don't just sit
there drinking your coffee.

1336
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,166
Call me names if you want to.

1337
01:02:58,167 --> 01:02:59,000
- I'm sorry to disappoint you,

1338
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:01,207
but I haven't any intention
of making a scene.

1339
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:02,791
- There we are, the
perfect machine at work.

1340
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:05,082
Am I in danger of losing my self control?

1341
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,499
Press button B, and get it back.

1342
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,124
- But I can see you're angry all the same.

1343
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,333
- Of course I'm angry.

1344
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,791
I'm angry because neither of you

1345
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,791
seem to realise the consequences
of your little frolic.

1346
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,832
- I resent that word, frolic.

1347
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:18,707
- Well, whatever it was then.
I'm not concerned with that.

1348
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:21,707
It's the wanton carelessness
of it that I can't forgive.

1349
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:22,791
If you must do these things,

1350
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:25,957
now why choose the first
night of a new nanny?

1351
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,124
- I was going to suggest, madam,

1352
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:28,499
that if you'd like to
leave the lunch to me,

1353
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,332
you could take the
children out this morning.

1354
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,124
- Oh, Nanny. How nice.

1355
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:34,500
- Not at all, madam. I love cooking.

1356
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,499
- That's the woman we're going to lose.

1357
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,416
- I'm terribly sorry. Surely
there's something we can do.

1358
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:44,874
- Couldn't we say I mistook
Sabina for you in the dark?

1359
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,457
- It wasn't dark.

1360
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,458
- NO-

1361
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:50,249
There's only one way out.

1362
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,499
After all, you've made your bed.

1363
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,832
- You mean go on pretending-

1364
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,374
- But you can't be serious, Mary.

1365
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:55,208
- But it would mean-

1366
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,457
- All it would mean is
that Nanny must think

1367
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,249
that you and Bruce share the same room.

1368
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,499
Nothing else, of course.

1369
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,333
- Well.
- Well.

1370
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:01,832
- It's our only hope of keeping her.

1371
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:05,125
- When you put it like that,
it seems almost our duty.

1372
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,499
I better go and warn Eve.

1373
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,832
We don't want her to
say anything awkward.

1374
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:12,499
- Oh, if you're going upstairs Bruce,

1375
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,957
you might help with the beds.

1376
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:17,000
- Certainly. Which shall I
start with? Yours or Sabina's?

1377
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,791
- Oh, you naughty naughty little girl.

1378
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:29,875
Oh, look at yourself. Oh, what a pot.

1379
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:34,792
Oh, I'll have to deal with
this in the bathroom. Oh dear.

1380
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,499
I wonder if there's another
dress for Miss Elizabeth, madam.

1381
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,832
I'm afraid there's been an accident.

1382
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,582
- An accident to Elizabeth?

1383
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,499
- Oh, she's up to no harm.

1384
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,041
Though Heaven knows, she might've done.

1385
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:13,416
The moment by back was
turned, my little miss ate

1386
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:15,249
the whole pot of cold
cream, if you please.

1387
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,874
- Oh my goodness. We must do something.

1388
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:17,999
- Oh, that's all right, madam.

1389
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,416
She's parted with it.

1390
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,417
- Are you sure?

1391
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:23,041
- Quite sure, madam.
There's no cause for alarm.

1392
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:26,500
It's extraordinary how some
children will eat everything.

1393
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:30,041
It's Elizabeth's the handful of those two.

1394
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:32,916
But of course you wouldn't
know, being only an aunt.

1395
01:05:32,917 --> 01:05:34,291
- I don't think you should
say that about Elizabeth.

1396
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:36,541
After all, you hardly
know the children yet.

1397
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:37,874
- Oh, I can always tell.

1398
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,832
I also noticed that with two children,

1399
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:42,041
all the good qualities of
the parents go into the one,

1400
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,749
and all the bad into the other.

1401
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:47,166
In this case, it's Master
Valentine's the lucky one.

1402
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:48,457
- What's that about Valentine?

1403
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:49,292
- Hello, Rodney.

1404
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:50,666
We were just talking about the children.

1405
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,041
- Oh.

1406
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:53,541
Valentine's a fine little chap, isn't he?

1407
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:54,500
- Oh, he certainly is.

1408
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:57,292
And what's more, he's inherited
his father's good looks.

1409
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,166
- Oh, I don't know about
that. It's a bit early to say.

1410
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:02,249
I mean, he's only about that high.

1411
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,083
- Come along, Nanny.

1412
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,542
- And I'll wager he'll have
his father's charm too.

1413
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:11,875
- Oh, so.

1414
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,125
- Did you turn the mattress, dear?

1415
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:38,874
- Well, what have you
got to say for yourself?

1416
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:41,416
- I think that question might
more easily come from me.

1417
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:44,374
- Turn on your heel like that,
and walk out of the house

1418
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,207
without even waiting for an explanation.

1419
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:48,416
- I have all the explanation I needed.

1420
01:06:48,417 --> 01:06:50,166
- It's always the same with you, Rodney.

1421
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:51,666
Whenever I do something you don't like,

1422
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:53,582
before I have time to
explain or do anything,

1423
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:55,624
you go and do something I despise-

1424
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,874
- Oh right, string a lot of words together

1425
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:58,708
and confuse the issue.

1426
01:06:58,709 --> 01:07:01,416
If there's any despising to
be done, I'm the one to do it.

1427
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,374
- Because I happened to kiss Bruce?

1428
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,082
- Because I happened
to see you, that's all.

1429
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,707
What beats me is why you should
pick Bruce of all people?

1430
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:10,082
- Why did you say Bruce
of all people like that?

1431
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,582
- Well, because.

1432
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:12,999
Because he isn't that kind of a man.

1433
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,082
Now had it been Victor, I
could have understood it.

1434
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:16,457
- If only you'd come
home a little earlier,

1435
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:17,458
it would have been.

1436
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:20,249
- What was it, a competition or something?

1437
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,041
- Oh. Oh, Victor behaved abominably,

1438
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:25,041
tried to take advantage of,
kissing me against my will.

1439
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:28,957
And then Bruce came in,
and I turned to him,

1440
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:33,457
as a ship seeks shelter in a storm.

1441
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:36,416
I was so grateful to
him, that I kissed him.

1442
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:37,499
- Out of gratitude.

1443
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,291
- Can't you see that in a way,

1444
01:07:39,292 --> 01:07:42,041
my kissing Bruce was a compliment to you.

1445
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:43,499
- I suppose to him, it was an insult.

1446
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,791
- He said I had the courage
to give up everything,

1447
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:50,042
because I wanted to be a wife to my man.

1448
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,666
That's you, Rodney.

1449
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:54,791
- Oh, thanks for the reminder.

1450
01:07:54,792 --> 01:07:57,207
- Oh, I know I encouraged Victor.

1451
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:59,208
But that was because I was unhappy.

1452
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:01,791
You made me feel as if I could never

1453
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:03,416
be the sort of wife you would want,

1454
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:06,708
that I'd always be incompetent
and disappoint you.

1455
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,624
I suppose I was trying to
bolster up my self respect.

1456
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,083
All I did was to lose it.

1457
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:16,833
I hated Victor and myself,
and I wanted to die.

1458
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:19,749
- Sabina.

1459
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:20,958
- Can you forgive me?

1460
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:23,582
- Well, you're so unpredictable.

1461
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:25,833
- I'll try to be more predictable.

1462
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:31,332
Oh, Mary. Rodney's been
so good and understanding.

1463
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,791
- Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

1464
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:34,874
Does he agree that it's
the only thing to do?

1465
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,041
- To do? To do what? What?

1466
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:37,749
- Oh, I haven't told him about that.

1467
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,542
Then, it's
about the time you did.

1468
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:41,250
- Oh, good morning.

1469
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:44,124
- Oh, good morning. Sorry about the golf.

1470
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:45,791
- Oh yes, we were to
play this morning. Yes.

1471
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:46,957
- It's too late now, isn't it?

1472
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:47,792
- I'm afraid it is.

1473
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:48,625
<i>- PW-</i>

1474
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,458
- That's all right, old man.

1475
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,541
- When's daddy coming up
to see his little boy?

1476
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:52,999
Corning, darling.

1477
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,082
- Oh, I'll go now if it'll please her.

1478
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,082
- She didn't mean you, Rodney.

1479
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:57,457
- No, darling, you see, she thinks

1480
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:59,541
Bruce is the children's daddy.

1481
01:08:59,542 --> 01:09:00,500
- Then what did she mean by saying that

1482
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:01,707
Valentine has inherited my good looks?

1483
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,417
- Not yours, Bruce's.

1484
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:05,750
- Bruce's?

1485
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,041
- You see, after last night,

1486
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:11,082
Nanny thinks that Bruce is married to me.

1487
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,624
We've got to keep up the pretence,

1488
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,125
because otherwise we're
afraid she'll give notice.

1489
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:18,541
- You'd better go up if you promised.

1490
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:19,833
- Oh, right.

1491
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:24,124
- So that's the little plan?
Very pretty, I must say.

1492
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,541
- Now don't be difficult, Rodney.

1493
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:26,500
- Difficult? You calmly
expect me to stand by,

1494
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:28,999
and let that Bruce usurp
my conjugal rights?

1495
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,249
- But he wouldn't, really.
He'd only pretend to.

1496
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,999
♪ Lum did he lum did he lum la la ♪

1497
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,499
- That's right, hit him. That's right.

1498
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,499
Faster, faster, giddy up.

1499
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,083
Oh, very good, Daddy.

1500
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,874
♪ Lum did he lum did he la la la ♪

1501
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:44,875
- Isn't it enough, I come home

1502
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:46,416
and find my wife in the
arms of another man?

1503
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,749
How do you think I've
been feeling since then?

1504
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,416
Do you realise how I spent last night?

1505
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:52,749
I walked the streets for hours.

1506
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,999
- You walked the streets?

1507
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,041
- Yes. All night. I just wanted
to get away from everything.

1508
01:09:58,042 --> 01:10:01,166
- Oh, you worm. You
didn't walk any streets.

1509
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:04,874
You spent the night in bed
at your club, didn't you?

1510
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:08,999
Oh, I despise a man who
lies to get sympathy.

1511
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,333
Bruce would never lie
like that, would he Mary?

1512
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,332
You wanted to frighten
me, to make me think

1513
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,332
you'd thrown yourself into the river.

1514
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,957
So that when you came
back, I'd be so relieved,

1515
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:21,582
I'd throw my arms around
your neck and apologise.

1516
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,332
- Sabina, don't keep changing the subject.

1517
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,916
If you think I'm gonna
stay here, and connive

1518
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:27,332
at this fantastic arrangement,
you're very much mistaken.

1519
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:29,207
And so are you. I'm getting out of here.

1520
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,083
- Oh, just a minute.

1521
01:10:30,084 --> 01:10:32,291
- Darling, you can't do this
to me, you simply can't.

1522
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:35,041
Don't do anything you'll
be sorry for afterwards.

1523
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:36,122
And where are you going to?

1524
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:39,750
- All I get here is
everything thrown in my face.

1525
01:10:39,751 --> 01:10:42,791
- What sort of things? How dare you?

1526
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:44,791
I hate seeing you like this.

1527
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,332
No, Rodney listen.

1528
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:48,041
- It's not good, Sabina.
It's gotta be this way.

1529
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:49,666
- Well, you see.

1530
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:50,707
- Now, where is my shirt?

1531
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,457
- Which shirt?

1532
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,749
- Not the one I'm wearing,
nor the one at the laundry.

1533
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,791
The other one.

1534
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:57,499
- It's airing. I'll go and get it.

1535
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,625
- And kindly find some
socks while you're about it.

1536
01:11:13,292 --> 01:11:15,000
- Why, Rodney. Are you going away?

1537
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:17,457
- Yes.

1538
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,832
- You've been hurt, haven't you?

1539
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,624
- I thought Bruce was my best friend.

1540
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,332
- Oh, poor Rodney, what
are you going to do?

1541
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:26,082
- Well, the recognised thing
is to go big game hunting.

1542
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:27,207
- But you wouldn't do that.

1543
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,582
- I don't know, I might.
Or I might go to Shanklin.

1544
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:30,583
- Why Shanklin?

1545
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,124
- Why anywhere? I can't stay here.

1546
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,832
The house will be full of ghosts.

1547
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:36,958
- You do look tired.

1548
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,832
- I am tired.

1549
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:41,417
I walked the streets all night.

1550
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,207
I don't remember much about
it until towards dawn,

1551
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:47,041
I found myself outside
the home in Colonial.

1552
01:11:47,042 --> 01:11:48,667
- How dreadful for you.

1553
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:53,082
Rodney, I know what it's like to be hurt.

1554
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:56,791
Sense of loss, wounded
vanity, all go in time.

1555
01:11:56,792 --> 01:11:58,999
But the disillusionment
destroys something inside.

1556
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,208
And that goes on forever.

1557
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:03,917
- Of course.

1558
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:06,499
You've been through it too.

1559
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,749
- Yes, indeed.

1560
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,999
There should be a bond between us, Rodney.

1561
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,999
We both know we can never love again.

1562
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,624
- But we can be friends, can't we?

1563
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,166
- Of course, Rodney dear,

1564
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:17,582
if you promise never to
try to make love to me.

1565
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,957
- Oh, I promise. Darling
Eve, you're very sweet.

1566
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,708
- Oh Rodney, don't call me darling.

1567
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:24,958
- Darling.

1568
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,958
- That didn't happen, Rodney.

1569
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:38,958
- Didn't it?

1570
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:42,708
Neither did that.

1571
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:47,041
- Oh, Rodney. You promised.

1572
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:48,124
- Oh, Eve darling don't take it like that.

1573
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,707
You'll make me feel I've
done something dreadful.

1574
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:51,957
- No, no. It's not your fault, it's mine.

1575
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:53,707
I'll have to tell you now.

1576
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:55,124
- Tell me, tell me what?

1577
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,999
- I've deceived you. I deceived you all.

1578
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,749
I let you think there
was a tragedy in my life,

1579
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,708
and I made it all up.

1580
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:02,832
- But Why?

1581
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:05,124
- I wanted you all to
think I didn't want men.

1582
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:08,500
And the truth is, men
have never wanted me.

1583
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:11,624
- Well, now you've got prove
to the contrary, haven't you?

1584
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:15,749
- No, it's only because you
were miserable about Sabina

1585
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,124
and felt you had to kiss something.

1586
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:20,249
- Well, you must believe I
found the experience enjoyable.

1587
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,374
Or I wouldn't have kissed you again.

1588
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:25,417
- Oh, Rodney. You've put new hope into me.

1589
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:33,957
- You don't seem to have any
socks without holes in them.

1590
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:35,917
- I've been telling you that for weeks.

1591
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,707
- I'll darn them for you, Rodney.

1592
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,874
- You can't. There's no darning wool.

1593
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,500
- I'll find some.

1594
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:47,916
- You don't seem to have
lost much time, do you?

1595
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:49,082
- You should worry.

1596
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:51,749
- I'm not, I'm only wondering
why a little man hater

1597
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,082
should take such a sudden
interest in your socks.

1598
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:56,457
- Well, maybe. I don't see what it is.

1599
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:58,832
But it may be out of the
kindness of her heart.

1600
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:01,457
- No that she seized on there socks,

1601
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,999
because she wanted to humiliate me.

1602
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,791
She knows I can't darn socks.

1603
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:07,291
- Wait, Sabina. Sabina, wait.

1604
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:09,666
- There you have there someone
who can darn your socks,

1605
01:14:09,667 --> 01:14:11,541
somebody who really is domesticated.

1606
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:12,999
I mustn't be selfish.

1607
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,249
- But, you've got it all wrong.

1608
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:16,249
- No, it's my incompetence
that all this comes to be.

1609
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:19,332
I'll never be able to cook and keep house.

1610
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,458
I must let you have somebody who can.

1611
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,499
- Look, you be a housekeeper
and nothing else.

1612
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,499
- No. You want a housekeeper, and a wife.

1613
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,791
- Sabina.

1614
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:32,291
- You can't expect me to be one of a team.

1615
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:34,667
- Who's talking about a
team, or anything else?

1616
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:36,708
Sabina, I-

1617
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:38,124
- You kissed her.

1618
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:40,458
Well, I know I kissed her,
but it was nothing personal.

1619
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:43,208
I just had to kiss something.

1620
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:47,707
- You mean, like I kissed Bruce?

1621
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:52,417
- Yes, that's right. Like a
ship seeking shelter in a storm.

1622
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:57,041
- But you won't go on
seeking shelter, will you?

1623
01:14:57,042 --> 01:14:58,707
- Well,

1624
01:14:58,708 --> 01:14:59,875
it depends on the storm.

1625
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,958
- Oh, darling. Don't let's
have any more storms.

1626
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,291
- Well! Oh, you snake in the grass!

1627
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:10,749
You wicked, wicked woman.

1628
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,750
- What ever's the matter?

1629
01:15:11,751 --> 01:15:13,624
- Her and you're husband,
they were kissing.

1630
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:14,500
- But, Nanny-

1631
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:16,124
- Don't you Nanny me, please.

1632
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:17,416
And on a Sunday morning too,

1633
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:19,207
with those innocent children upstairs.

1634
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,957
And you with a lovely husband of your own,

1635
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:23,082
you shameless shameless woman.

1636
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:26,749
- Don't you call me a woman, you old bag.

1637
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:27,583
- Sabina.

1638
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:29,457
- What did you call me?

1639
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,666
- I called you an old bag, you old bag,

1640
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:36,041
a shameless, snooping,
sanctimonious old bag.

1641
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:37,832
- Oh, may Heaven forgive you.

1642
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,041
- Sabina, stop it.

1643
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:40,749
- I won't stop it.

1644
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,167
- And I won't stop in
this house to be insulted.

1645
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,083
- Well, that'|| teach us.

1646
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:50,666
- Oh, darling I do love you.

1647
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,958
- But Nanny, please listen.

1648
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:59,082
- Well, she was a good nurse as nurses go.

1649
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:00,124
And as nurses go, she-

1650
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,458
- Oh Bruce, don't.

1651
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:05,832
Well the only constellation is that

1652
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,833
now we can relax and be ourselves again.

1653
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,666
Should we let bygones be bygones?

1654
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,749
- I'm not sure, after the way you behaved.

1655
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,249
- The way I've behaved?

1656
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,374
- Well, you might at least pretended

1657
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:19,374
to mind about Sabina and me.

1658
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,582
- I suppose it never occurred you

1659
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,041
I might've been pretending not to mind.

1660
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:24,957
- Oh, darling. I didn't realise.

1661
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:25,833
- No, don't.

1662
01:16:25,834 --> 01:16:27,374
- Oh, very well.

1663
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:30,207
- It's nothing, I just don't
want to make a fool of myself.

1664
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:32,374
- Oh do, darling, do.

1665
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:36,249
I didn't know you could.

1666
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,666
- I told you, you would never understand.

1667
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:38,958
- Well, I can try.

1668
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:44,333
- Oh! Sex maniacs, the lot of you.

1669
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:50,750
You'll send my things after me.

1670
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:00,832
- Why is everyone in this house
always slams doors, darling?

1671
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,666
- I don't know, darling.

1672
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:04,542
It's just that sort of a house.

1673
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:10,042
The joint! The dog next
door's got the joint!

1674
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:16,500
- Drat! Sabina!

1675
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:21,250
- Oh, you mangy dog. Stop.

1676
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:27,124
- Come back, I'm bleeding
to death. Sabina, come back.

1677
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:29,582
Don't wonder around the
garden like a half whit.

1678
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:30,791
Somebody do something.

1679
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:31,999
Help!

1680
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,041
- Well, where is everybody?

1681
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:34,666
- Take that kettle off.

1682
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:36,249
- What on Earth is going through Rodney?

1683
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,207
Now you wait a minute.
Daddy will soon be back.

1684
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:46,541
Sabina, come back!

1685
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,083
- What on Earth?

1686
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,374
Sabina, call an ambulance.

1687
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:55,458
- Mary, Mary.

1688
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:06,042
Sabina, where are you?

1689
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:10,458
Rodney, Rodney where are you?

1690
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:14,583
- Sabina, Mary, Sabina!

1691
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:16,499
My fingers broken. Where's the iodine?

1692
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,958
- There's water coming
through the ceiling.

1693
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:23,666
- Oh, good heavens.

1694
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:35,332
Oh, dear. This
is no time for fooling.

1695
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,874
World
security cannot be achieved

1696
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:39,125
without peace at home.

1697
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,832
The Minister of Food said
in Birmingham last night,

1698
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:45,332
this country can never repay

1699
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,499
the debt it owes to the British housewife.
