takes the magic out of marriage

feel Rodney and I are drifting apart I

305

356
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,960
of a year if you follow the thing to its

357
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,309
logical conclusion is the only way to be

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,620
what our civilization has brought us to

horrible and he looked back once but he

603
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,780
must have been asked to make witty ways

604
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,960
no that's when I began to run luckily

605
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,350

00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,640

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,050
where is everybody I've got the most

608
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,860
wonderful news

609
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,340
I found a nanny a rare

610
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,500
well done Mary the old country can still

611
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,090
muster an airing in a crisis it's one

612
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,470
thing to get a nanny it's another to

613
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,480
keep her that's what I want to talk to

614
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,100
you about if we're gonna keep this one

615
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,600
we must avoid the mistakes we made with

616
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,280
the last march or leading up to is that

617
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,080
I must never ask you to do anything for

618
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,390
my Valentine well that's where we went

619
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,280
wrong before wasn't it she was in our

620
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,660
pain in the end she did as much for you

621
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,790
as fast well this time that sure Sally

622
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,710
and she equally as well let that

623
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,290
solution I'm afraid the only thing is to

624
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,540
try my idea and what is your idea

625
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,920
simplicity itself

626
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,570
we just didn't anything for Valentine

627
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,010
and Elizabeth's are brother and sister

628
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,100
nary what a brainwave wait a minute wait

629
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,470
a minute if they're gonna be brother and

630
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,510
sister

631
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,140
that would mean it'd have to have the

632
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,360
same father mother of course and who do

633
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,380
you propose the father a mother should

634
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,270
be well read I'm out all day and the

635
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,220
mother should be on the stuff I think it

636
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,200
ought to be Rodney and Sabina well

637
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,100
that's fair enough

638
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,140
what is a Burris well I say I say it's

639
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,940
an unnatural arrangement you see right

640
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,020
expect me to give up all claim to

641
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,580
Elizabeth just like that well if you

642
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,020
feel so strongly about it

643
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,270
moosh we could divide the parentage you

644
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,800
be the father and I'll be the mother

645
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,420
Jordan seem it allowed you and I

646
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,730
sleeping in the same world I suppose it

647
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,560
would or the whole thing's ridiculous

648
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,300
well there's no point in arguing Bruce

649
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,440
as a matter of fact it's got to be

650
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,430
Sabinas

651
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,720
because I told nanny it was for my

652
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,450
sister's children oh well don't you be

653
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,580
sisters are we but the only way I can

654
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,320
persuade to the countess she was telling

655
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,700
me how happy she was in her last job

656
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,620
with Jim Mary at the actress so I said

657
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,000
well my sister was in a play with you

658
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,440
married and there just turn the scales

659
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,750
well your people do not helping yet and

660
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,120
I loathe her it was probably mutual

661
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,530
personally speaking I think it is a very

662
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,120
clever job Mary it's only well for you

663
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,560
what I become an uncaught by marriage

664
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,230
dear no I refuse to accept Romney as the

665
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,270
father of my child

666
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,830
sure you'd rather Rodney than some

667
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,110
strange man you didn't know well do you

668
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,280
agree or don't you because if you don't

669
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,420
I should just head ring and what the

670
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,520
hell oh no Mary don't do that I'm sure

671
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,930
Bruce wouldn't mind being uncle once he

672
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,860
gets used to the idea

673
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,110
after all it's worth I'm you sacrifice

674
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,490

675
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:35,469

half last birthday nice it's a little

692
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,049
vague about time not about daily routine

693
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,450
I hope I train my children to my rhythm

694
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,000
rhythm is essential to regularity and

695
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,190
regularity is written here not for

696
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,770

749
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,790
upsetting you is that I found a nanny

863
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,719
becomes attainable when one knows that

864
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,269

1061
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:03,869

1072
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,580

an accident an accident to Elizabeth oh

1106
01:02:17,709 --> 01:02:19,930
she's not no harm so hidden though she

1107
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,880
might have done the moment my back was

1108
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,390
turned

1109
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:23,829

are you sure quite sure madam there's no

1114
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:31,989
cause for alarm

1115
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:34,180
it's extraordinary how some children

1116
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,509
will eat everything

1117
01:02:36,509 --> 01:02:39,160
Elizabeth's the handful of those too but

1118
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,479
of course you wouldn't know being Oh me

1119
01:02:40,479 --> 01:02:42,729
not I don't think you should say that

1120
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:44,529
about Elizabeth after you hardly know

1121
01:02:44,529 --> 01:02:46,390
the children yet oh I can all the tale I

1122
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,549
often notice but the true children all

1123
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:50,140
the good qualities of the parents going

1124
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,489
to the running of all the bed into the

1125
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:53,529
other in this case it must the bellman

1126
01:02:53,529 --> 01:02:56,319
I'm so lucky one what about Valentine

1127
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,969
hello Rodney we were just talking about

1128
01:02:57,969 --> 01:03:00,729
the children oh don't learn to find

1129
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:02,319
little Japanese oh he definitely is very

1130
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,269
much more it's in his father's good

1131
01:03:04,269 --> 01:03:04,779
looks

1132
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:07,959
oh I know by that redundant to say I

1133
01:03:07,959 --> 01:03:09,759
mean them then about that high

1134
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:11,739
come along Manny and I'll wager he'll

1135
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:14,939
have his father's Tom too

1136
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,440
did you tell the mattress it

1137
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,269
well what have you got to say for

1138
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:45,859
yourself I think that question might

1139
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:48,019
more easily come from medium turn on

1140
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:50,180
your heel like that I'll walk out of

1141
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:51,739
those without even waiting for an

1142
01:03:51,739 --> 01:03:53,599
explanation that's all the explanation I

1143
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,729
needed it's always the same with you

1144
01:03:55,729 --> 01:03:56,930
love me whenever I do something you

1145
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,789
don't like before I turn to explain or

1146
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:00,499
do anything you're gonna do something I

1147
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:02,509
despise this right there's a lot of

1148
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:04,039
words together and confuse the earth you

1149
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:05,809
really despise him to be done I'm the

1150
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:06,319
one to do it

1151
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:08,960
because I happen to kiss Bruce because I

1152
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,759
happen to see you that's all what beats

1153
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:12,289
me is why I should pick Bruce of all

1154
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:14,420
people why did you see Bruce of all

1155
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,359
people like because because he isn't it

1156
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,769
kind of a man not happy being Victor I

1157
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:20,509
could've understood it is Onew come home

1158
01:04:20,509 --> 01:04:23,150
a little earlier it would have be what

1159
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,670
was this a competition or something Oh

1160
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:27,079
Victor behaved abominably tried to take

1161
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:28,940
advantage of me kissing Lee against my

1162
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,059
will and then Bruce came in and I turned

1163
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:36,079
to him us as a sheep seek shelter in a

1164
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,349
storm I I was so grateful to him but but

1165
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:42,019
I kissed him out of gratitude conscious

1166
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:44,210
either in a way my kissing booth was a

1167
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:47,599
compliment to you it was an insult he

1168
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,759
said I had the courage to give up

1169
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:52,009
everything because I wanted to be a wife

1170
01:04:52,009 --> 01:04:54,700
to my man

1171
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:58,069
getsu rotten thanks for the reminder

1172
01:04:58,069 --> 01:05:00,680
oh I know I encouraged Victor but that

1173
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,739
was because I was unhappy you made me

1174
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:05,359
feel as if I could never be the sort of

1175
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,460
wife you'd want but I'd always be

1176
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,969
incompetent and disappoint you I suppose

1177
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:12,469
I was trying to bolster up my

1178
01:05:12,469 --> 01:05:15,880
self-respect or like it was to lose it I

1179
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,619
hate admitting myself and I wanted to

1180
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:23,440
die Sabina can you forgive me

1181
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,630
what is so unpredictable I'll try to be

1182
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:32,089
more predictable oh good and

1183
01:05:32,089 --> 01:05:33,799
understanding well I'm better glad to

1184
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:35,450

01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,759
