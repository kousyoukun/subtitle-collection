1
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,840
失控玩家

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,130
这里是自由城
This is Free City.

3
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,470
看看这家伙  戴墨镜的家伙
Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people.

4
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,730
戴墨镜的个个都是英雄
And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes.

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,820
他们无所顾忌  穿梭在这座城市
They have a devilmaycare attitude and they run this town.

6
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,450
你真性感
You are so hot.

7
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
哦  我知道
Oh, I know.

8
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,370
看到了吗  那甚至不是他的车
See? That's not even his car.

9
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,960
也不是他的妞
Or his wife.

10
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,340
但对于这些戴墨镜的人来说  他们可以为所欲为
For the sunglasses people, they get to do anything they want.

11
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,430
他们做着各种任务
They go on all sorts of missions.

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,260
留着很酷的发型  穿着很酷的衣服
They got cool hair, cool clothes.

13
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,520
我是说  这儿法律甚至都不算是真正的法律  更像是一些温和的建议
I mean, laws aren't really laws to them. They're more like mild suggestions.

14
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,440
就比如说  那个家伙肯定不会归还那辆车的
Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car.

15
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,320
更不会归还那个漂亮的妞
Or that nice lady.

16
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,580
明白我的意思了吗？  英雄
See what I mean? Hero.

17
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,060
我叫盖  我住在天堂
My name is Guy, and I live in paradise.

18
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,610
早上好  元宝
Good morning, Goldie.

19
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,950
我们一直都住在自由城
I've lived here in Free City my whole life.

20
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,450
我有个最好的朋友还养了条金鱼
I've got a best friend, I've got a goldfish,

21
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,040
我在银行工作
and I work at the bank.

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,410
男人的快乐就是如此简单
What more could a guy want?

23
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,000
星期天的天气应该会很温和  阳光灿烂
Sunday should be warm and sunny

24
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,710
只有少许的车辆路过
with just a scattering of drivebys.

25
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,250
今天是去海滩玩的好日子  但不要去刺客海滩
Great day for the beach, but not Hitman's Beach,

26
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,340
该区域正在遭受
which will be mined and sprayed with highcaliber fire

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,840
一架被盗的武装直升机疯狂扫射…
from a renegade gunship stolen by…

28
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,010
每天早上
And every morning,

29
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,090
我都会用一杯最美味的咖啡  来开始我的新生活
I start my day with the most delicious coffee

30
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,220
这绝对是全世界最最最美味的咖啡
in the whole, wide, whole world.

31
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,850
中杯咖啡  加奶油  加两块糖
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

32
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,310
你真懂我
You know it. Mmm.

33
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,850
嗯
Mmm!

34
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,270
有点烫了
That is unexpectedly hot.

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,810
天啊  太美味了
Jeez, that's good.

36
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,860
仿佛破处了感觉一般  但这是对我嘴巴而言
It's like losing my virginity, but in my mouth.

37
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,240
谢谢你用爱做出的美味咖啡
Thank you for making this with such love.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,410
不用谢
You're welcome.

39
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,610
约翰尼警官
Officer Johnny!

40
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,820
祝你今天开心  盖
Have a good one, Guy.

41
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,790
不是开心  是超级开心的一天
Don't have a good day, have a great day!

42
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,240
鞋 店

43
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,080
搞什么
Hold the fudge.

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,960
还没有人买下那双豪华运动鞋吗  我今天一定要买下
You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed up those bad boys? Today is the day.

45
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,460
你每天都这么说  我马上就回来买
Like every other day. I'll be back for those.

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,000
取款机

47
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,220
你好 盖, 您的当余额为：

48
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,220
取消

49
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,220
提款

50
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,140
噢  还差点钱
Oh! So close.

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,560
嗯  这真是有史以来最棒的一杯咖啡
Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee of all time.

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,060
我想为它写首歌
I wanna write a song about it.

53
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,020
我摇晃着我的身体随歌起舞
I wanna dance to that song with my body.

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,180
我热爱我的生活
I love my life.

55
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,020
能找到适合自己的位置待下去  真是非常有意义
There's something about finding your lane and just staying in it.

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,770
所以他们称之为“舒适区”因为太他妈的舒服了
That's why they call 'em comfort zones, they're so damn comfortable.

57
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,360
哦 乔
Oh, Joe!

58
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,900
每周一都是这样  对吗  乔
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

59
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,070
你说得对 盖  是的
You said it, Guy. Yeah.

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,450
在自由城  我拥有我需要的一切
In Free City, I have everything I need.

61
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,160
我不会祝你们今天开心…
Don't have a good day…

62
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,460
我要祝你们今天非常开心
have a great day.

63
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,880
谢谢
Thank you.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
保重
Take care.

65
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,880
除了一件事
Except one thing.

66
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,340
看起来真幸福
Seem happy.

67
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,640
哦  拜托  别担心了  盖  你也会找到你的真命天女的
Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy. You gonna find someone.

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,300
哦  没事的  巴德
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

69
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,850
感觉我一直都在找她  你知道吗
Feel like I've been looking for her forever, you know?

70
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,520
也许缘分还没到
Maybe it's not meant to be.

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,100
所有人都趴在地上
Everybody down on the ground!

72
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,530
我知道我要找什么样的女人  哦 让我猜猜
I know the woman I'm looking for. Oh, let me guess.

73
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,280
一个有着离奇的幽默感的女人  幽默感
A woman with an offbeat sense of humor. Sense of humor.

74
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,780
对流行音乐非常痴迷
An obsession with feelgood diva pop.

75
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,870
流行音乐  是的  没错
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

76
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,950
她在我脑子里租了间房子一直住在里面不会离开了
She's rented space in my brain and she won't move out.

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
你知道吗  我也不想让她离开
And you know what? I don't want her to.

78
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,710
你知道吗  她既不会住进你的脑子  也不会离开
Well, guess what? She won't move either in or out.

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,500
知道为什么吗  因为这个人根本不存在
You know why? 'Cause she doesn't exist.

80
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,630
她只是个幻想 是幻想  太残忍了 你太残忍了
She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy. That's cruel. You're cruel.

81
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,250
你太烂了 烂透了  我是说实话而已
You're being rotten right now. Rotten. I'm being real.

82
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,420
别逞英雄  很快就会结束
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

83
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,340
那你觉得下班后一起海滩上喝啤酒怎么样
So how about it? Beers on the beach after work?

84
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,430
好啊  下班后我们一起去海滩喝啤酒
Of course we're going for beers on the beach after work.

85
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,800
这就是我要的幸福感
That makes me so happy.

86
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,890
我也是
Me too.

87
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,070
你有什么发现吗
What have you got?

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,900
神秘等级的证据  这就是你要找的  对吧
Proof of a secret level. That's what you're looking for, right?

89
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,660
你是有录屏还是截图
You got a video or a screen grab?

90
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,490
都没有  但是我知道谁有
Nope. But I know who does.

91
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,870
你知道我对浪费我时间的人会做什么吗
Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

92
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,450
哦  哇  哦  看来某人是想玩玩
Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play.

93
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,420
嘿  你真的是英国人  还是用了变声器
Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter?

94
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,210
因为也许我们可以晚点再见面
'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

95
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,920
我可不想参观你妈妈的地下室  谢谢
I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

96
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,380
冷笑话吗
Got jokes, huh?

97
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,920
我这有张地图显示了他藏身之所的位置
Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house.

98
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,220
不知道你能否进去  但如果你进去了  56号剪辑可能会让你感兴趣
Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.

99
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,810
现在  我有个问题
Now, I got a question.

100
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,520
这段视频到底有什么特别之处
What's so special about this video clip anyway?

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,730
特别之处就是  我会杀了对此好奇的人
What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

102
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,600
嗯  我明白了  有趣  真有趣
Mmm, I see. Fun. Yeah, that's fun.

103
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,400
妈的  姑娘  你真是活泼啊
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

104
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,200
但说真的  这算是掠夺还是只是为了获得更多经验?
But seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,660
你还是好奇了
Those are questions.

106
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,040
你看到上一个抢劫犯穿的运动鞋了吗
Did you see the sneakers on that last robber?

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,250
两点半那个?
The 2:30?

108
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,870
不  四点那个
No, the 4:00.

109
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,130
四分之三高的华丽泡沫鞋底
The threequarter hightop, gorgeous foam soles.

110
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,130
当他踩到我的脸时  我几乎都没有感觉
I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face.

111
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,590
哦 天哪  哇
Oh, man. Wow.

112
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,260
大城市的生活  一点也不像
Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it.

113
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
把它给我
Give it to me!

114
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,880
看起来要下雨了
Looks like rain.

115
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,090
有人看到我的猫了
Has anyone seen my cat?

116
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,930
你知道吗  盖  人们总是会这样形容
You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like,

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,270
“这家伙是我认识的人中最擅长把鞋子踩在我脸上的人”
"Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."

118
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,650
我的意思是  那种感觉就像  好像不是一只鞋踩在你的脸上
I mean, when you put it on there, you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

119
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,740
我不会祝你今天开心  我会祝你今天非常开心
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

120
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,080
我喜欢这首歌
Love that song.

121
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,920
那是新歌
That's a new one.

122
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,050
嘿
Hey!

123
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,020
就是她
That's her.

124
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,600
谁啊
Her who?

125
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,310
我的梦中情人  巴迪
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

126
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,150
她真的存在
She exists.

127
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,730
我要去和她谈谈  哇 哇
I'm gonna go talk to her. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

128
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,980
等等  伙计  她戴着墨镜
Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

129
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,650
所以呢
So?

130
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,110
什么叫“所以呢”
Whatcha mean "so?"

131
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,240
戴墨镜的人是不会和我们这样的人聊天的
So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us.

132
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,410
你知道的  我得试一试
You know that! I gotta try.

133
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,830
听着  盖  盖
Look, Guy! Guy!

134
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,870
盖  去海滩上喝啤酒怎么样
Guy! What about beers on the beach?

135
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,290
打扰一下

145
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,580
我们这通常没有把椅子放在桌子上

哦  自由之城吗  啊  不是的
Oh, Free City? Ah. No.

150

I, uh, have a lawsuit against the publisher

151
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,890
而我需要找的据在游戏里
and the evidence that I need is in the game.

152
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,510
所以我必须…   哦
So then I had my codes…  Oh…

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,390
我希望我们不打烊  这样我就能多了解了解了
I wish we weren't closing so I could hear more about this.

Ooh. "Cappuccino." I enjoy saying that.

159
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,590
这个单词真长啊
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

160
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,840
抱歉  你说什么

173
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,630
只是想让你们保持警觉  我开玩笑的
Just keeping you on your toes. I was kidding.

174
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
他只是在开玩笑
He was just kidding!

175
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,300
哦  你以为我会剥夺你的野蛮艺术吗
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself of your baristic artistry?

176
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,550
不可能  绝不可能
No way, no how.

177
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,260
嗯  太烫了
Mmm. That's hot.

178
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,890
就像耶稣要给我的舌头洗礼
It's like Jesus washed my tongue…

179
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,770
但还没有结束  他就告诉我爸爸
but right before he finished, he finally told my dad,

180
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,560
“这孩子已经很圣洁了”

183
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,070
卡布奇诺
Cappuccino.

184
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,990
我不会祝你今天开心
Don't have a good day…

185
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,790
我要祝你今天非常开心  我想
… have a great day, I guess.

186
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,080
好的  祝你好运

所有人都趴在地上
Everybody down on the ground!

188
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,760
别逞英雄  很快就会结束
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

189
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,950
是那个女孩
That's the girl.

190
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,040
我们已经讨论过这件事了
We've been over this.

191
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,950
你昨天试着和她聊天  但没有成功
You tried to talk to her yesterday, it didn't work.

192
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,540
不会成功的
It will never work.

193
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,910
她戴着墨镜
She's wearing sunglasses.

194
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,500
我们不要去招惹戴墨镜的人
We don't mess with the sunglasses people.

195
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,590
也许我可以给我自己买几副墨镜
Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own.

196
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,750
什么  你说什么呢  你不能这么做
What? What are you talking about? You can't do that.

197
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,380
天哪  我在做什么
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

198
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,210
嗨

Hi.

201
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,680
我需要你的墨镜
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.

202
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,930
我只是想…
I'm just gonna…

203
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,390
想用一下你的墨镜
I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec.

204
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,770
见鬼  你在搞什么
What the hell do you think you're doing?

205
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,980
滚回那边去  伙计
Go back to your side, man.

206
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,310
他只是个NPC  真他妈浪费…
He's just an NPC. Waste that mother…

207
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,940
好的  我只想借用一下墨镜  好吗
Okay, just need to borrow them for a sec, okay?

208
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,320
退后 我说了 不要过来  很快就好 真的
Back off! I said, don't! Just real quick. Real quick.

209
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,400
停下
Stop!

210
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,660
你是脑子坏了还是怎么了
You broken or somethin'?

211
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,870
我是抢劫犯
I'm the robber!

212
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,530
你应该乖乖躺下什么也别干
You're the guy who lies down and takes it!

213
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
拜托  趴下别动啊
Please, just stay down!

214
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,790
我说了  趴下
I said, stay down!

215
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,330
伙计  你不能这么做  伙计
Guy, you don't do this, man.

216
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,500
这不是你该做的
This isn't you.

217
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,920
你不能这么做
You don't do this.

218
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,420
也许我就该这么做
Maybe I do.

219
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,130
你他妈到底…
What is wrong with this…

220
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
这是什么蠢任务
stupid mission?

221
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,720
我说了  你要杀了他
I told you to smoke his ass.

222
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,890
放手
Let go!

223
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,680
我用完就还给你
I'll give them right back.

224
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,680
我说了…

他只是睡着了
He's just resting.

227
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,940
搞死了
In pieces!

228
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,280
那个人死了
That man is dead!

229
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,490
他是太困了
He's so sleepy.

230
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,410
我会把你的枪放在这
I'm just gonna put your gun down…

231
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,450
就在这里

233
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,790

打扰一下
Excuse me.

239
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,870
你看到这个了吗
Do you see this?

240
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,210
周五之前把季度报告放在我桌上
Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

241

要我看什么
What am I looking at?

250
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,920
是这样  这个用户  他的眼镜被抢了
Okay, so this user, he gets his glasses stolen

251
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
然后被杀了

252
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,130

An NPC? That's impossible.

255
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,630
是啊  没错
Yeah, exactly.

256
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,920
还没有人可以在他们身上装备NPC的皮肤呢
Nobody can equip an NPC skin on their avatar.

257
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,930
好吧  那你就把这个垃圾菜鸟踢出去  终身禁赛  就完事了
Yeah, so you just boot the trashass noob and ban him for life, you're done.

258
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,140
我试过了  但我…
I tried that, but I…

259
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,770
我追踪不到他
I can't trace him.

260
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,100
不管怎么说  挺厉害的
Whoever it is, they're good.

261
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,360
嗯  你得把你的工作做得更精细一些  伙计
Hmm. You gotta be better at your job, buddy.

262

I'm pretty good.

263
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,190

选择您的皮肤
Select your skin.

265
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,400
嘿  凯斯  你用什么皮肤
Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with?

266
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,240
乌什吧  那个恶警
The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,

267
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,780
有杆大枪  还有大胡子

268
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,410
嗯  那个小松鼠  我喜欢
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it.

269
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,540
不知道该不该问  但你要怎么装扮
Almost scared to ask, but what are you going with?

270
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,160
呃  全身长满毛  还都是骚粉色  你应该会很害怕
Uh, full body mustache, hot pink. You should be very afraid.

271
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,750
毛骨悚然
I'm terrified.

272
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,380
那我们开始吧
Let's do this.

273
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,750
说真的  伙计
Seriously, man.

274
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,290
老实说  我觉得这套兔女郎装有点过头了
I'm just being honest, I think the bunny suit is just a little much.

275
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,920
你说什么
Excuse me?

276
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,760
好吧
Right.

277
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,510
兔子装  行了吧? 是我的错
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

278
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,680
嘿  40岁的老处男  快过来
Hey, 40yearold virgin! Get over here!

279
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,850
我们走吧
Let's go!

280
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,180
嗯  嗯  卡其斯队长
Uhhuh. Captain Khakis.

281
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,140
过来 来吧 伙计  快来
Come here. Come on, bud. Go, let's go.

282
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,890
再过来一点  他来了
Closer. There he is.

283
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,600
穿蓝衬衫的家伙
Blue shirt guy.

284
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,440
蓝色衬衫?
Blue shirt?

285
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,060
是
Yes.

286
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,150
你好  警官
Hello, Officer.

287
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
兔子
Rabbit.

288
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
皮肤不错
Nice skin.

289
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,990
谢谢夸奖
Thank you. That's sweet.

290
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,370
你哪儿弄到的
How'd you get it?

291
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,870
嗯  呃  我想可能是遗传的吧  我很幸运
Well, uh, mostly genetics, I think. I'm pretty lucky.

292
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,580
我的皮肤是纯天然的
I have naturally dewy skin.

293
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,910
听着  小子
Listen up, Neutrogena.

294
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,210
你不能穿成这样到处走  游戏规则很清楚
You know you can't go around looking like that. The rules are clear.

295
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,380
还有一件事
And another thing.

296
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,880
你不能黑掉NPC的头像  不 先生
You can't hack the NPC avatars. No, sir!

297
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,210
是它搞砸了任务…   搞砸了
It screws up the mission load…  Screws it up!

298
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,550
现在让这个游戏看起来很糟糕
… and it makes the game look bad.

299
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,960
太可怕了  是的
Horrible! Yeah.

300
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,800
我知道  大概搞砸了5%吧
I got, like, 5% of that.

301
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,510
把皮肤脱下来
Lose the skin!

302
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,890
我… 脱下来?
I…  Lose?

303
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,680
我该怎么脱下我的皮肤呢
How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?

304
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,850
脱下来  伙计
Take it off, man.

305
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,220
脱下来就行了  你干吗呢
Just take it off. What are you doing?

306
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,430
什么  说真的
What? Seriously.

307
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,980
全部脱下来 你的脸 还有这身行头  怎么脱啊
The whole thing. The face, the outfit. How?

308
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,270
就是脱啊 脱下皮肤  脱下来
Everything. Ditch it. Take it off.

309
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,690
如果你不脱  我们就只有杀了你
If you don't, we're gonna kill you.

310
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,310
为什么  然后我们会一直杀掉你
Why? And we're gonna keep killing you.

311
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,520
为什么啊
Still why?

312
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,940
直到我们查出你到底是谁
Until we do find out who you are…

313
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,690
然后我们会把你终身禁赛
and then we're gonna ban you for life.

314
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,150
好吧  不  不是的  我想按你们说的办
Okay. No, no. Okay, I want to comply.

315
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,450
我只是觉得这些威胁的命令很混乱
I just find the order of those threats very confusing.

316
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,200
看来有人想来一炮了  把他干掉
Somebody's about to get shot. Light him up

317
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,760
不是
No.

318
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,110
出来吧  蓝衬衫
Come on, Blue Shirt.

319
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,840
噢  我没料到会这样  你看到那个了吗
Oh! Didn't see that one coming. Did you see that one coming?

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,130
吓死我了
Scared me a little bit.

321
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,760
我们来找你了  蓝衬衫
We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!

322
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,220
来找你了哟
Coming to get ya.

323
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,880
我们马上就抓到你了
We're coming to get ya.

324
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,510
等等  等等
Wait! Wait!

325
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,060
我可以解释
I can explain everything.

326
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,930
我拿到了这副眼镜之后  我就可以看到一些东西了
I found these glasses and then I can see things now.

327
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,600
那些… 那些不存在的东西
Things that…  Whoa, whoa. Things that aren't there.

328
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,480
虽然不存在  但确实又在那
Except they are there.

329
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,900
我知道这听起来很疯狂  但这是真的
I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!

330
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,990
你可以跑  蓝衬衫  但你躲不掉的
You can run, Blue Shirt, but you cannot hide.

331
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,570
出来吧  蓝衬衫  你逃不出兔子的魔爪的
Come on, Blue Shirt. You can't escape the rabbit.

332
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,790
我们是顶级捕食者
We're apex predators.

333
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,540
我们会碎骨  殴打  还会割喉
All we do is bone and brawl and slit throats.

334
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,250
太高了  太高了
Too high! Too high!

335
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,800
哦  你想玩吗  蓝衬衫  那就瞧好了
Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt? Watch this.

336
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,850
我厌倦了这一出  凯斯  是时候让我对这个贱人开启上帝模式了
I tire of these games, Keys. It's time I went godmode on this beyotch.

337
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,100
好的  开启吧
Okay, bring it.

338
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,020
哦  开启了  来吧
Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.

339
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,910
我非常非常擅长这个
I'm so, so good at this.

340
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,000
该结束了  银行出纳员
Time's up, bank teller!

341
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,070
不
Nope!

342
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,760
我不能死
I can't die!

343
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,510
我永远都不会死
I'm never gonna die!

344
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,850
蓝衬衫那个家伙令人心碎的故事
And that was the heartbreaking story of Blue Shirt Guy.

345
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,100
到此就结束了
The end.

346
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,310
不科学啊  什么
Doesn't make sense. What?

347
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,520
我刚检查了服务器的统计数据
I just checked the server stats.

348
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,070
我们干掉了蓝衬衫那家伙  但是在线玩家的数量没有变化
We killed Blue Shirt and the number of players online didn't change.

349
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,280
应该只是个小故障  伙计
It's just a glitch, man.

350
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
这没什么大不了的  我知道 我知道
It's not a big deal. I know, I know.

351
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,110
这看起来像是某种新的问题  你知道吗
It just seems like that's something new, you know?

352
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,530
凯斯  我知道你在想什么  好吗  你最好别去跟安特万说
Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay? You should not talk to Antwan.

353
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,370
我只是觉得把这些说清楚很重要
I just think it's important to be transparent, okay?

354
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,450
不是的
Uhuh. No.

355
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,240
安特万正在跟进续作的发布  他要么不在乎
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch. He's either not gonna care

356
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,330
要么他会非常生气  然后他会责怪我们
or he's gonna get pissed and then he's gonna blame us.

357
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,330
所以  我不知道你有没有搞清楚这个状况
So, I don't know what you haven't figured out about the whole situation.

358
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,760
还有  你不是麻省理工学院的天才吗  独立游戏设计师?
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius, indie game designer?

359
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,420
你光靠给上级反馈有什么用
What are you doing down here dealing with complaints?

360
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,430
穆瑟  这是一个漫长而悲惨的故事  涉及到失败的梦想
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic story involving failed dreams,

361
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,680
涉及到绝望  还有堆积如山的大学债务
desperation, and a mountain of college debt.

362
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,470
你不会想听的
You do not wanna hear about that.

363
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,020
你说得太对了
You're absolutely right.

364
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,360
这个故事听起来又可怕又无聊  还充满了白人特权
That story sounds horrible and boring and full of white privilege.

365
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,270
反正别告诉安特万
Don't talk to Antwan.

366
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,490
我们做梦也没想到会发生这种事
We never dreamt this would've happened.

367
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,240
我的意思是《生活本身》是一个鱼缸游戏
I mean, Life Itself, it's essentially a fishbowl game.

368
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,000
人们不仅仅是在玩游戏  也在跟着它成长
People aren't playing it, they're watching it grow.

369
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,830
严格意义上说  这是一场观察体验
It's a strictly observational experience

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,670
体验计算机生成的角色之间相互作用和进化
where computer generated characters interact and evolve.

371
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,630
我以为我们能把它做出来就很幸运了
I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.

372
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,260
这就是凯斯如此迷人的地方  他对自己的天才浑然不知
That's what's so charming about Keys, he's clueless about his own genius.

373
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,050
不  米莉才是天才
Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

374
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,680
呃  她负责从头开始制造人工智能引擎
Uh, she built the AI engine from the ground up.

375
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,180
那么  说点私人化的东西行吗
So, to get a little personal,

376
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,270
是什么事情让你坚持早起
what's the thing that gets you up in the morning?

377
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,850
为了喝一杯中杯咖啡  加奶油  加两块糖的
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

378
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,360
还有件事是什么来着
What's the other thing?

379
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,900
哦  对了  是对被认可的永无止境的渴望
Oh, yeah. An insatiable thirst for validation.

380
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,530
她不是在开玩笑  我没有开玩笑
She's not kidding. I'm not.

381
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,860
那你呢
How about you?

382
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,450
代码吧  代码吗
Code. Code?

383
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,530
代码  代码 是的
Code. Code, yeah.

384
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,610
说说吧
Here we go.

385
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,450
因为这不仅仅有0和1  还蕴含着隐藏的信息
'Cause it's not just zeros and ones, it's hidden messages.

386
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,620
实际上  我认为自己不是一个代码编写者  而是一个作者
I like to think of myself, actually, as not a code writer, but an author.

387
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,170
我只是用0和1代替单词  因为单词有时候会让你觉得使用的不恰当
I just use zeros and ones instead of words 'cause words will let you down.

388
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,670
但是0和1永远不会  0和1简直酷炸了
But zeros and ones, never. Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

389
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,460
他不是在开玩笑  我没有开玩笑
He's not kidding. I'm not.

390
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,220
现在  我得问问
Now, I've gotta ask.

391
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,590
你们两个之间有很多化学反应
There is a lot of chemistry between the two of you.

392
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,600
是不是已经不仅仅是朋友关系…   不
Has this evolved into more than…  No.

393
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,100
不可能 这完全是柏拉图式的  不 不 不 我们只是朋友
No way. No. It's strictly platonic. No, no, no. We're friends.

394
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,350
我们就像是最好的朋友  友谊万岁
We're like best friends. Friendship.

395
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,100
现在你的游戏将由索拉米发行
And now your game is gonna be released by Soonami,

396
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,690
这是世界上最大的发行商之一
one of the biggest publishers in the world.

397
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,690
这很疯狂  是的 是的
It's crazy, actually. It is, yeah.

398
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,610
不过  这看起来确实有点不太搭
It does seem a little bit like an unlikely pairing, though.

399
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,990
是的  我也完全不明白
Yeah, I didn't totally get it either.

400
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,650
但是米莉对这些事情有一种女人的直觉
But Millie's got a real instinct for these things…

401
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,070
安特万是个天才
Antwan is a genius.

402
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,580
虽然他傲慢  令人讨厌  但他真的很擅长他的工作
He's brash and obnoxious, but he's really good at what he does.

403
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,910
这也是个让我们的作品被更广泛的观众体验到的机会
It's a chance for our work to be seen by a wider audience.

404
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,040
天啊 那两个人真是又年轻又蠢  天哪
God, those two were young and dumb. Jeez.

405
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,670
所以现在都要搞破门而入这一出了吗
So we're breaking and entering now?

406
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,750
给大便组成的公司工作感觉如何
How does it feel working for a galactic black hole of frozen shit?

407
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,880
你必须开  我不能跟你聊
You have to leave. I can't talk to you.

408
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,590
啊  这就是所谓的羞耻感吧
Aw, shame will have that effect.

409
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,380
不  米莉  我是说我不能和你聊
No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.

410
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,010
我甚至不能看你  我只能看这些背景物体
I can't even see you. I'm literally focusing on background objects

411
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,600
因为看着你的嘴唇动  就违反了我的保密协议  会让我被炒的
because looking at your lips move violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

412
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,270
噢  被安特万解雇吗  那个偷走我们作品的人?
Aw, fired by Antwan, the guy who stole our work?

413
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,100
不  他买了我们的作品  虽然最后被搁置起来了
No, he bought it and then he shelved it.

414
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,310
懂了吗  你沉浸在过去  你被困住了  你得向前看啊
All right? You're living in the past. You are stuck. You gotta move on.

415
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,570
我怎么才能向前看呢
How can I move on?

416
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,110
你怎么能这样呢
How can you?

417
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,110
安特万偷了我们的人工智能引擎  拿给他的枪手用
Antwan swiped our AI engine to use in his dumb shooter.

418
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,740
是吗  米莉  因为老实说  我不太确定
Did he, Millie? Because honestly, I'm not so sure.

419
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,450
我们的游戏的确很复杂  很漂亮  也很有趣
Our game was complex and beautiful and interesting

420
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,870
现在这个“自由之城”可能很受欢迎  但它太蠢了  蠢的让我想哭
and Free City, it may be popular, but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

421
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,870
那就别维护他了  帮我揍他一顿
Then stop defending him and help me beat his ass.

422
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,210
米莉 我…   拜托 凯斯 他偷了我们的技术
Millie, I'm…  Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

423
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,710
迄今为止他都还不承认
And now he's lying about it

424
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,170
而且他还不用给我们应得的版税
so he doesn't have to give us the credit and the royalties that we deserve.

425
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
米莉
Millie…

426
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,930
我找到了一条线索  被一个玩家藏在了一个视频片段里
I found a clue. It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

427
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,470
我需要你把我弄进去
All I need from you is to get me in there.

428
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,890
米莉  我很在乎你…
Millie, I care about you…

429
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,020
但你得走了
but you need to leave.

430
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
今天应该会有点不一样吧  元宝
Today is gonna be different, Goldie.

431
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,760
在看什么
What are we lookin' at?

432
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,600
你是谁
Who are you?

433
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,970
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay. Okay.

434
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,730
前几天我碰见了你  你在哼那首很好听的歌
We ran into each other the other day, you were humming that great song.

435
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,890
哦  是啊
Oh, yeah.

436
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,650
我还以为你是NPC呢  你怎么找到我的
I thought you were an NPC. How did you find me?

437
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,770
我在外面的谋杀列车旁等你呢
I waited outside by the murder train,

438
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,190
然后我就跟踪了你
then I followed you.

439
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
他妈的
Shit!

440
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,000
我应该和你一起走吗
Should I come with you?

441
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,500
好的
Yes.

442
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,170
天哪  刚才发生了什么事
Holy hell, what just happened?

443
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,760
刚才你差点毁了我的任务
What just happened is you almost blew my mission.

444
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,060
不  我是说  我们是怎么从那里到现在这个地方的
No, I mean, how did we get from there to wherever this is?

445
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,470
你是说传送枪吗
You mean the portal gun?

446
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,560
传送枪?  听起来很贵
Portal gun? That sounds expensive.

447
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,850
哇  你真是个菜鸟
Wow, you are a special kind of noob.

448
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,150
谢谢  你也是
Thank you. You too.

449
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,310
转过身去
Turn around.

450
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
好吧
Okay.

451
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
噢
Oh.

452
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,370
这是北极吗
Is this the North Pole?

453
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,950
听着  伙计
Listen, dude.

454
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,660
我叫盖  盖 随便你叫什么吧
Guy. Guy. Whatever.

455
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,540
这儿都是NPC装备上的道具
Props on the NPC outfit,

456
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,120
我正准备想办法偷点东西
but I'm busy trying to figure out how to steal something.

457
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,040
也许我能帮你
Maybe I could help you.

458
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,250
我喜欢单干
I work alone.

459
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,840
这儿还有很漂亮的手榴弹
You have beautiful grenades.

460
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,760
另外  如果你想在这里有一定影响力的话
Besides, if you want to have any chance of making an impact here,

461
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,590
你需要升级到更高的等级
you need to have a higher level than that.

462
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,640
这真难用啊  别乱弄
That's tough. No. No.

463
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,390
更高的等级?
Higher level?

464
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,680
天啊  菜鸟
Good Lord, rook.

465
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,480
看到了吗
See?

466
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,190
哦  那是我的等级
Oh. That's mine.

467
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,810
这是你的等级
And that's yours.

468
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,610
怎么  这是最高的等级还是最低的
Oh…  What, is one the best or the worst?

469
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,280
从数值上看  没有比这更低的等级了
There is literally nothing lower.

470
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,200
那么  我怎样才能达到更高的等级呢
Well, how do I get to a higher level?

471
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,280
真的想吗  真的
Really? Really.

472
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,410
得获得一些东西  好的
You know, get stuff. Yeah.

473
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,870
你在开玩笑吗  好吧
Are you kidding me right now? Okay.

474
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,870
要获得经验 还有枪  是的
Experience, guns…  Yeah.

475
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
把它放下  嗯 嗯
Put that down. Uhhuh.

476
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,460
还有钱  这里是自由之城
Money. This is Free City.

477
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,630
你可以抢劫商店  劫车
You could rob a store, carjack someone,

478
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,880
还可以一拳打在行人的脸上  你会搞明白该怎么做的
punch a pedestrian in the face. You'll figure it out.

479
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,470
哦  我从来不会伤害无辜的人
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

480
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,390
嗯  你这个说法我倒是第一次听说
Hmm. I've got to admit that is kind of refreshing.

481
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,890
有时我甚至都忘了  并不是在这里遇到的每个人都是反社会的男孩
Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet on here is a sociopathic manchild.

482
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,230
谢谢
Thank you.

483
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,980
等等  但是世界并没有那么糟糕  不是吗
Wait. But the world isn't that bad though, is it?

484
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,780
这话真凄凉啊
Oh! It's pretty bleak.

485
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,990
如果你见过这个世界的主宰  你就明白了
If you ever met the dick responsible for this world, you'd agree.

486
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,700
你是说上帝吗  你见过上帝吗
Are we talking about God? You've met God?

487
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,080
上帝是不是很混蛋
And he's a dick?

488
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,790
他叫安特万  当然  他绝对是个巨魔
His name's Antwan, and yes, he's an absolute troll.

489
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,660
巨魔真的存在吗
Trolls exist?

490
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,340
听着  我不知道有没有人这么做
Look, I don't know if anybody does it,

491
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,340
但是你也可以通过做一个好人来增加经验点
but you could rack experience points up by being a good guy.

492
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,420
像个英雄一样  哦 放松点
Like a hero. Ooh. Easy, tiger.

493
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,550
如果你不想开枪  你可以偷他们的枪
If you don't wanna shoot people, you could steal their guns.

494
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,090
反正都可以提升你的等级
All that shit makes your level go up.

495
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,640
去做个好人吧
Go be the good guy.

496
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,060
好吧  不对  我要做个非常好的人
Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy.

497
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,730
好吧  好好享受你的童贞吧
Okay, well, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.

498
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,890
你走吧
Off you go.

499
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,100
好吧  等等  我怎么知道我已经升级到足够高的等级了呢
Okay. Wait! How will I know that I've leveled up enough?

500
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,020
呃 超过100级 然后我们就可以接着聊  哇
Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk. Whoa.

501
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,780
那再见吧  那可比1级高了不少啊
Bye now. That's so much more than one.

502
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,190
差了99级  再见吧
It's like 99 more…  Bye now.

503
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
好吧
Okay.

504
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,270
嗨
Hi.

505
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,470
谢谢  盖
Thanks, Guy.

506
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,530

509
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,200
早上好  元宝
Good fucking morning, Goldie.

510
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,130
我要告诉你们三个字  蓝衫男
I have three words for you. Blue Shirt Guy.

511
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,880
蓝衫男正在疯狂升级  并以创纪录的速度一直扮演英雄角色
BSG is leveling up and at a record pace by playing the hero.

512
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,510
全世界的人都在问“这家伙到底是谁”
It's got people all over the world asking, "Just who is this guy?"

513
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,220
我不知道这家伙是谁  但他的技术比所有这些玩家都强
I don't know who this guy is, but he's outskilling all these players.

514
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,010
他来了  干掉蜂蜡
And here he is, taking out Beefoven,

515
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,970
来自拉格纳罗克族的102级玩家
a level 102 from Clan Ragnarok.

516
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,020
胡扯吧  这家伙是谁啊
This is bullshit. Who is this guy?

517
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,270
我不知道  但他很强
I don't know, but he's good.

518
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,650
是的  他很强  看起来像个NPC一样
Yeah, he's good. He looks like an NPC

519
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,070
而且他跑来跑去  以疯狂的速度升级
but he's running around, leveling up crazy fast

520
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,360
还一直在里面当好人
by being the freaking good guy.

521

“电子游戏自由之城中有五花八门的角色

523
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,530
派珀  蓝衫男到底是谁
Piper. Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

524
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,780
你说得太对了
You're absolutely right.

525
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,960
蓝衬衫男  他或她到底是谁
Blue Shirt Guy. Who is he or she indeed?

534
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,500
这件衬衫是什么
What is this shirt?

535
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,050
你的衣领在哪里  其他的纽扣在哪里
Where's your collar at? Where's the rest of the buttons?

536
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,800
而且衬衫也没塞进裤子里去  你看起来很邋遢
And it's not tucked in. You look sloppy.

537
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,630
你看起来糟透了  你还练了一些肌肉吗
Matter of fact, you look horrible. Did you pick up some muscles, too?

538
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,010
是谁鼓动你这样做的吗
Or is somebody outside pumping you up?

539
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,060
很抱歉我最近没在你身边  巴德
I'm sorry that I haven't been around, Bud.

540
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,560
我一直在想一些事情
I've been figuring some stuff out.

541
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,600
你这话是什么意思  你有什么好想的
Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"? It is nothing to figure out.

542
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,770
你上床睡觉  然后醒来
Okay? You go to bed, you wake up,

543
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,440
先喝杯咖啡  然后再来上班
you get some coffee, then you come to work.

544
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,110
然后你明天再重复同样的事情
And then you repeat the same thing tomorrow.

545
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,730
那个女孩  哦 我的天啊
The girl. Oh, my God.

546
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,360
我跟她谈过了  我跟她谈过了
I talked to her. I talked to her.

547
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,860
戴墨镜的那个?   墨镜 对
The one with the sunglasses? The sunglasses, yes!

548
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,990
我和一个戴墨镜的人聊过天了
I talked to one of the sunglass people

549
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,530
现在我也是戴墨镜的人中的一员了
and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

550
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,240
我
Me.

551
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,830
所有人都赶紧趴在地上
Everybody down on the ground!

552
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,410
你太性感了
You're so hot.

553
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,380
如果我能告诉你你可以生活的更有滋有味呢
What if I could tell you that you could be more?

554
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,710
你的生活会更充实
Your life could be fuller.

555
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,000
你可以自由地做出你自己的决定  做你自己的选择
That you're free to make your own decisions. Your own choices.

556
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,170
哟  笨蛋
Yo, dumbass.

557
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,630
我们正忙着谈事呢
We are in the middle of something.

558
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,430
呃…
Uh…

559
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,470
那是我的枪  安静点
That's my gun. Quiet time.

560
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,600
这些家伙改变了我的生活  他们也可以改变你的
These puppies changed my life. And they're gonna change yours, too.

561
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,430
得了吧  你知道我们不戴墨镜的
Come on now, you know we don't wear sunglasses.

562
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,230
我们现在可以戴了
We do now.

563
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,980
现在这个归我了
Mine now.

564
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,480
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

565
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,650
戴上吧  不
Put 'em on. No.

566
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,860
生活并不是我们原有的那样  懂吗
Life doesn't have to be something that just happens to us. All right?

567
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,580
只要戴上眼镜  你就会看到
Just put the glasses on and you're gonna see.

568
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,490
你会看到的
You're gonna see.

569
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,870
来吧
Come on.

570
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,250
我做不到  好吗
I can't, okay?

571
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,420
对不起
I'm sorry.

572
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,100
我要留着这个  混蛋
I'm keeping these, asshole mouth.

573
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,520
现在给我滚出去  去当个好人吧
Now get out of here. Go be nicer.

574
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,600
快走  赶紧走
Beat it. Go, go, go.

575
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,270
不要走  用跑的
Don't walk, run.

576
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,400
而你呢…
And you…

577
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,860
啊
Ugh.

578
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,020
抱歉
Sorry.

579
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,860
嗯  你可以做得比那家伙好得多
Um, you could do so much better than that guy.

580
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,110
你可以和一个好人在一起
You could be with, like, a good guy.

581
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,530
也许我不需要和任何男人在一起
Or maybe I don't have to be with any guy.

582
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,080
是吗  当然了  大多数男人都很糟糕
Right? Exactly. Most of them are awful.

583
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,870
的确如此  太可怕了
They really are. Terrible.

584
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,250
是啊  想做什么就做什么吧
Yeah, do whatever you wanna do.

585
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,220
你是我最好的朋友  巴迪
You're my best friend, Buddy.

586
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,630
而且你也不用害怕
And you don't have to be scared.

587
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,470
如果你改主意了  随时找我
If you change your mind, I'll be around.

588
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,020
凯斯  我们的蓝衫男无处不在
Yo, Keys, our Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

589
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,980
我知道
I know.

590
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,480
这家伙到底是谁啊
Who is this guy?

591
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:41,760
米莉
我得跟你谈谈！
尽快!!!

拜托了！！！

我们的证据就在那个储藏室里

我一个人做不到
我试过了

592
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,640
我到了
I'm here.

593
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,850
真的很感激  凯斯
I really appreciate this, Keys.

594
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,980
好吧  我只想说清楚
Okay. Just to be clear,

595
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,980
我现在要做的就是把门打开
all I'm doing right now is opening the door.

596
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,230
如果这段视频真的证明安特万非法重复使用了我们的代码
If this clip really does prove that Antwan reused our code illegally,

597
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
你去找到之后  就马上离开
go find it and get out.

598
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,910
玩家在市中心做珠宝店的任务
Player's doing the jewelry store mission in midtown.

599
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,530
你有5分钟的时间
That gives you 5 minutes.

600
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,200
行动吧
And go.

601
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,800
凯斯  你真他妈是个天才
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

602
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,960
真的吗
Really?

603
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,550
我现在正坐在马桶上  偷用户的密码
I'm sitting on the toilet right now, stealing user codes,

604
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,380
所以我并不是很喜欢你的夸奖
so I don't exactly feel like one.

605
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,720
哦  你从来没有这样过
Oh, you never have.

606
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,180
好在我更了解
Good thing I know better.

607
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,430
好的  您要查找的片段应该在您左侧的墙上
All right. The clip you're looking for should be on the wall to your left.

608
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,350
谢谢你的协助  你去拿吧
Thanks for the assist. You got it.

609
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,940
我希望里面有您要找的证据
I hope it has the proof you're looking for.

610
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,760
凯斯  我需要你的帮助
Keys! I need your help!

611
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,550
他在那个地方设置了诱杀装置和出生点
He's got that place boobytrapped with spawn points.

612
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,800
米莉  我帮不了你
Millie, I can't help you.

613
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,490
蓝衫男?
Blue Shirt Guy?

614
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,290
这是辆亨利  这很酷吗  感觉真的很酷
It's a Henley. Was that cool? It felt really cool.

615
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,910
你看起来真的很漂亮  哇  这房子也真漂亮
You look really pretty. Wow, this house is so nice.

616
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,550
你在这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

617
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,550
我试着偷一段视频剪辑  现在我们要做的就是别死
I was trying to steal a video clip, now we're trying not to die.

618
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

619
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,430
你知道的  就是那个穿NPC皮肤的人
You know, that player in the NPC skin.

620
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,270
米莉  那房子里没有其他玩家
Millie, there are no other players in that house.

621
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,770
把我的手弄痛了
That actually hurt my hand.

622
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,020
趴下
Get down!

623
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,700
对不起  哦  天哪
I'm sorry! Oh, God!

624
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,460
干的漂亮
We're doing great.

625
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,340
哇
Wow!

626
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,010
我们该走了
We should definitely go!

627
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
哦  该死
Oh, shit!

628
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,070
你口袋里有一把格洛克手枪吗  没有
Is that a Glock in your pocket? No.

629
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,150
什么  有两把格洛克手枪
What? It's two Glocks.

630
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,730
我想这东西不能飞吧
I don't suppose this thing can fly.

631
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,980
不能
No.

632
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,230
跳吧
Jump.

633
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,560
安特旺酒店

634
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,420
哦 见鬼
Oh, shit.

635
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,930
早上好  小羊羔
Good morning, sheeple!

636
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,430
哦  你被解雇了
Oh, you are fired.

637
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,270
有些人担心血腥僵尸  零售商不会销售这款游戏
There is some concern with the bloody zombies, retailers won't carry the game.

638
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,980
砍掉吧  不要了  不能发生这种事  下一个
Cut it. It's out. Never even happened. Next.

639
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,230
是你的律师  他们需要拿到你的证词
It's your lawyers. They need to get your deposition…

640
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,980
是哪一起诉讼
Speak. Which lawsuit are we talking about?

641
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,650
米莉  米莉·拉斯克?  不用在意
Millie, Millie Rusk? No sweat.

642
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,450
她胜诉不了的
That will never see the inside of a courtroom…

643
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,450
因为她没有证据  而她的前搭档现在在为我工作
because she's got no proof and her expartner works for me.

644
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,620
我们现在是最棒的
We're golden.

645
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,290
安特万  嘿  你看起来真帅
Antwan, hey. You look great.

646
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,700
我还以为你还在《燃烧人》 项目呢
Uh, I thought you were still at Burning Man.

647
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,120
哦  我看起来像还在《燃烧人》项目吗
Oh, does it look like I'm still at Burning Man?

648
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,290
你 你 你…
You, you, you…

649
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,630
别说了  闭上你满脸胡子的嘴  听我说
No. So, shut your stupid, bearded face and listen.

650
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,500
听说游戏里有个看起来像NPC的混蛋跑来跑去了吗
You heard about the asshole running around in the game who looks like an NPC?

651
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,170
是啊  是啊  我们叫他蓝衫男  我们会除掉他的
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy. But we're gonna get rid of him.

652
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,760
别除掉他啊  人们喜欢他  社交媒体上到处都是
Don't get rid of him. People like him. It's all over social media. No.

653
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,930
事实上  知道我要做什么吗  我将在自由之城2中使用这款皮肤
In fact, know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna use the skin in Free City 2.

654
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,350
哦  书呆子们  我们要对蓝衫男做些升级  好吗
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

655
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,440
改一下  把他变成杀手什么的
'Roid him out. Make him a hitman or something.

656
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,400
安特万  我们移植自由之城1皮肤的进度严重滞后了
Antwan, we're already way behind porting over the skins from Free City 1.

657
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,150
皮肤? 这 一点不用担心
Skins? Don't even worry about that.

658
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,860
反正在自由之城2中也用不了了
They won't be usable in Free City 2.

659
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,150
安特万  你之前告诉粉丝们…
Antwan, you told the fans…

660
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,610
自由城市2可以兼容的  广告已经推广出去了
Free City 2 is backwards compatible. It was in the commercial.

661
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,820
你说续作里会安排同样的角色
You said there'd be the same characters in the sequel.

662
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,330
嗯  是这样的  我那时候是骗人的
Well, here's the thing. When I said that, I was lying.

663
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,700
听着  安特万  这个游戏已经比以往任何时候都更令人讨厌了
Listen, Antwan, the game is already buggier than ever.

664
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,210
我收到了一堆用户投诉  数不胜数
I got a stack of user complaints, like a mile high.

665
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,710
听着  我知道这很糟糕
Look, I know it sucks.

666
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,420
但是IP识别是非常困难的  对吗  所以根本不用担心
But the IP recognition is rock hard. Okay? So don't even worry about it.

667
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,590
我是说  我们可以做一个原创游戏
I'm just saying, we could make an original game.

668
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,720
什么
What?

669
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,300
原创吗  既然我可以做续作我为什么还要做原创
Make an original? Why would I do that when I could make a sequel?

670
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,470
续作
A sequel.

671
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,680
做续作能解决那些问题吗
So we can make it better?

672
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,770
人们就喜欢大IP  喜欢续作
IPs and sequels, that is the thing that people want.

673
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,100
我问你一个问题  好的
Let me ask you a question. Okay.

674
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,640
你喜欢肯德基炸鸡  对吧
You love Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?

675
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,730
嗯 嗯  不喜欢
Mmmhmm. No.

676
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,730
如果你喜欢肯德基  而我做的是肯德基
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken, and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,

677
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,730
我知道你喜欢肯德基炸鸡
and I know that you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,

678
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,530
如果你喜欢肯德基  我难道还要开另一家店
why would I make another restaurant called,

679
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,740
起名叫“肯火鸡”吗
uh, I don't know, "Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

680
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,860
对不对 这没必要啊 伙计  嗯嗯 没必要
Okay? Makes no sense, homie. Mmmhmm. No sense.

681
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,370
我要给你提供什么  续作  肯德基炸鸡2.0
What am I gonna give you? A sequel. Kentucky Fried ChickenChicken, Part Two.

682
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,250
嗯  能旗鼓相当就行
Uh, yum. Drop the deuce on him.

683
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,620
来吧  过来
Come on. Come here. Come here.

684
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,920
我不想让你有压力
I don't want you to stress

685
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,500
尤其是你还有这一头光彩夺目的头发
that glorious shampoo commercial head of yours about it.

686
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,630
自由之城2将会非常精彩
Free City 2 is gonna be jumunjious.

687
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,550
这不是靠吹出来的
That's not a word.

688
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,220
你确定你不想升到编程部门吗
You sure you don't wanna bump up to programming?

689
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,180
我知道你在这方面很擅长
I know you got the brains for it.

690
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,470
不用了  谢谢  我在这里很好
No thanks. I'm good right where I am.

691
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,900
那就好  怕升迁  我能感同身受
Love it. Fear of flying. Can't say I can relate.

692
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,270
不过  只要不用涨薪我都无所谓
But all good with me if I don't have to pay you more.

693
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,980
安特万走咯
Antwan out.

694
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,210
这家伙是谁啊
Who is this guy?

695
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,170
我采纳了你的建议
I took your advice.

696
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,300
我升级了
I leveled up.

697
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,550
真厉害
Impressive.

698
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,350
你为什么要做这些
Why are you doing all of this?

699
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,440
你知道吗  我觉得我被困住了
You know, I guess I felt…  trapped.

700
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,020
被我的生活困住了
You know, in my life.

701
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,230
我觉得就像是…
I just felt so…

702
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,030
卡住了一样
Stuck.

703
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,740
嗯  然后我看到了你
Yeah. And then I saw you.

704
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,990
然后我看到了你
Then I saw you.

705
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,080
你是谁
Who are you?

706
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,000
我是盖
I'm Guy.

707
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,120
不  你到底是谁
No, who are you really?

708
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,290
就是盖啊
Still Guy.

709
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,420
所有这一切  升级得如此之快
All of this, leveling up so fast.

710
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,510
向全世界竖起中指
Giving this whole world the finger.

711
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,930
你是怎么做到的
How are you pulling this off?

712
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,050
我从来没有对任何人竖起手指过
I've never given anyone any of my fingers.

713
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,890
你在索拉米工作  是吗
You work at Soonami, don't you?

714
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,680
不  你肯定有内幕消息
No. You've got an inside track.

715
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,520
我在银行工作  好吧 银行
I work at the bank. Right. The bank.

716
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,730
所以  你就是个碰巧在银行工作的厉害的黑客
So, you're just this incredible hacker who happens to work at the bank.

717
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,230
是的  我在银行工作
Yes, I work at the bank.

718
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,570
你的皮肤是从哪里弄来的
Where did you get that skin?

719
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,570
我生来就有啊
It's always sort of been there.

720
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,860
为什么人们总是问我这个问题
Why do people keep asking me that question?

721
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,780
我不知道  他们为什么这么问
I don't know, why do they?

722
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,000
不  不  我也不知道  我…
No, no. Not doing that. I…

723
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,460
现在到底什么情况
What's happening right now?

724
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,420
我不知道  但我不相信
I don't know, but I don't buy it.

725
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,880
不
No.

726
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,840
好吧 不说这个了  好的 好的
Okay, fine. I'll forget it. Fine. Good.

727
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,300
我不再追究  好的
I'll let it go. Yes.

728
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,010
太棒了
Great.

729
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,510
我想  我们都有自己的秘密
We all have our secrets, I guess.

730
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,260
是的  没错
Yes, we do.

731
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:05,930
嘿
Hey.

732
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,480
你喜欢吃冰激凌吗
Do you like ice cream?

733
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,230
我真不敢相信我从来没来过这里
I can't believe I've never been here.

734
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,230
嗯  这算是个秘密
Well, it's sort of a secret.

735
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,320
我和我的朋友巴迪总是来这里  这里又安静又安全
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy, always come here. It's quiet and safe.

736
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,110
这倒是
Yeah, it makes sense.

737
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,160
这里没有任务
No missions here.

738
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,370
哦  你一定要尝尝这个  你会觉得我疯了
Oh, you gotta try this. You're gonna think I'm crazy.

739
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,910
这是全世界我最喜欢的口味
This is my favorite flavor in the whole world.

740
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,210
我们要两张平常的
We'll take two of the usual, please.

741
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,540
你说对了，盖伊
You got it, Guy.

742
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,640
这是泡泡糖的味道
It's bubble gum flavor.

743
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,480
你认为我疯了，是吗？
You think I'm crazy, don't you？

744
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,750
盖… 滚出我的脑洞!我喜欢泡泡糖冰淇淋
Guy... Get out of my brain hole! I love bubble gum ice cream.

745
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,750
不,你没有  你是在取笑我吗？
No, you don't. Are you making fun of me right now？

746
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,250
不！没人会喜欢泡泡糖冰淇淋
No! Nobody likes bubble gum ice cream.

747
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,350
不  我喜欢啊
No, I do.

748
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,790
我失恋了就会吃这个
I had a relationship end over bubble gum ice cream.

749
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,060
不是吧 给  好的
No way. Here. Yeah.

750
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,720
干杯  干杯
Cheers. Cheers.

751
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,030
嗯
Mmm.

752
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,430
味道很棒吧
How good is that?

753
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,590
你能尝到吗
You can taste it?

754
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,300
味道吗？就像我的舌头生了个婴儿
Taste it？ It's like my tongue had a baby with a sunrise.

755
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,630
嗯哼?  嗯
Mmmhmm? Mmm.

756
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,450
咖啡曾经是我最喜欢的食物
Coffee used to be my favorite food,

757
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,980
但是和这个相比  简直是天壤之别
but compared to this, it tastes like liquid suffering.

758
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,480
怎么了
What?

759
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,110
没什么  你真有趣
Nothing. You're funny.

760
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,780
我吗？  是的
I am? Yeah.

761
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,250
有些怪诞
Weird funny.

762
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,890
但合我的口味
But that's kind of my speed.

763
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,060
怪诞  也合我的口味
Weird funny, that's totally my speed, too.

764
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,090
太好了  对了 我还知道一个笑话
Great. Yeah. I know a joke.

765
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,730
一个相当有趣的笑话  你想听吗
A weird funny joke. You wanna hear it?

766
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,500
请吧  好的
Please. Okay.

767
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:34,800
一个同性恋者和一个坐轮椅的人试图谋杀一个很小的孩子，跛子对同性恋说…  哇  停下来
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair are trying to murder a very small child... The cripple says to the homosexual... Whoa. Stop, stop.

768
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,010
停！你从哪儿听说的？
Stop! Where did you hear that？

769
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,910
一个劫匪把这段话告诉了司机，司机觉得很搞笑，所以我就把这它记了下来，告诉了所有人
A robbery. The gunman told it to the driver who thought it was hilarious, so I memorized it and told everyone.

770
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,710
提个忠告
Word of advice？

771
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,950
不要抄袭自由之城巨魔的笑话
Don't crib your jokes from the trolls of Free City.

772
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,120
巨魔?
Trolls?

773
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,540
那是个秋千吗
Is that a swing set?

774
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,520
天啊…
Holy…

775
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,530
好吧  这太奇怪了
Okay, this is too weird.

776
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,660
复古玛丽亚  泡沫口香糖冰淇淋  然后又荡秋千?
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice cream, and now swings?

777
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,000
这太奇怪了  我也觉得
This is too weird. I thought the same thing, too.

778
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,540
我也这样觉得
I thought the same thing.

779
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,630
当我很小的时候  我很喜欢荡秋千
When I was younger, I was obsessed with swings.

780
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,960
我的童年…
Growing up in my family, it was…

781
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,420
你不会想听的
You don't wanna hear this. No.

782
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,010
噢  我什么都想听
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

783
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,640
我小时候  我的原生家庭  不够好  不足以培养出成材的人
Growing up in my family, it wasn't good enough to be great.

784
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,810
但是又迫使我必须赢  那种压力
You had to win, and that pressure, you know,

785
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,940
就是常态
it was just constant.

786
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,940
但是当我在后院荡那个小秋千的时候
But when I was in the backyard on that little swing…

787
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,230
你知道吗  在那一刻
You know that moment,

788
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,240
在荡起与回落的那一刻
that split second between rising and falling,

789
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,360
当你享受那种失重感的时候  你会感觉你是自由的
when you're totally weightless, it feels like you're free.

790
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,450
像坠入爱河
In love.

791
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,740
感觉是自由的  你说的  嗯
Free. What you said. Yeah.

792
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,710
我很想吻你  这是不是很奇怪
I really wanna kiss you. Is that weird?

793
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,330
你想吻我吗
You want to kiss me?

794
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,840
我太想吻你了
I wanna kiss you so badly.

795
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,460
你想狠狠的吻我吗
You want to kiss me badly?

796
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,010
不  不吗
No! No?

797
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,930
不 不 不  我想温情地吻你
No, no, no, no, no. I wanna kiss you well.

798
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,640
我是说  我真是个白痴
I mean, I'm an idiot,

799
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,260
所以我有时会像个自痴一样说话
so I say things like an idiot sometimes.

800
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,720
不  没有  没有
No, you're not. You're not.

801
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,180
我是说  嗯
I mean, um,

802
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,640
呃  如果你知道怎么吻  那就吻吧
uh, if you know how to, go for it.

803
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:38,980
我知道该怎么吻
I know how.

804
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,230
好吧
Okay.

805
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,900
开始了
Here it goes.

806
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:11,470
那比冰激凌味道好多了
That was so much better than ice cream.

807
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,930
哇哦
Whoa!

808
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,430
我想有人在敲门
I think someone's at the door.

809
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
那就
I'll say.

810
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,560
嗯  这真是太棒了
Well, this was great.

811
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,730
好的 好的  有缘再见吧 好吗
Yeah, it was. Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

812
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,610
嗯  一定
Yes. Definitely.

813
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,150
也许在现实世界里见
Maybe in the real world.

814
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,400
什么
What?

815
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,240
嗯  是啊  是啊
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

816
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,780
好的 再见  好的
Okay. Bye. Okay.

817
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,950
再见  莫洛托夫
Bye, Molotov.

818
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,950
嘿  我的真名是米莉
Hey…  my real name is Millie.

819
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,960
我的真名仍然是盖
My real name continues to be Guy.

820
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,970
米莉  开门  米莉  是我  是凯斯  开门  赶快
Millie, open up! Millie, it's me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

821
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,760
米莉  是我  开门
Millie! It's me, open up!

822
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,810
什么  你是对的
What? You were right.

823
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,220
你是对的  哦 接着说
You were right. Oh, come on in.

824
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,810
你是对的  我们的代码  的确在自由之城
You were right. Our code, it is in Free City

825
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,690
还有  米莉  起作用了
and, Millie, it works.

826
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,360
是啊  我知道  但我们没有证据
Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof.

827
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,400
暂时忘了这件事吧
Just forget about that for one second.

828
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,780
我是说我们的游戏《生活本身》
I'm saying that our game, Life Itself,

829
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,740
里面的角色会成长  改变  会越来越真实
where characters would grow and change and feel real…

830
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:13,990
是吗  起作用了
Yeah? … worked.

831
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,780
凯斯  人工智能起作用了
Keys. The AI worked.

832
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,290
这就是为什么自由之城如此逼真  为什么人们如此喜爱它的原因
It's the reason why Free City is so realistic and people love it so much.

833
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,330
当然  虽然看起来也不一样
And of course it doesn't look the same.

834
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,290
这里面没有瀑布  没有蝴蝶和独角兽
There's no waterfalls, there's no butterflies and unicorns,

835
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,250
所有的角色都有不同的皮肤  他们当然不会弄成一样的
all the characters have different skins. Of course they do.

836
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,840
但游戏中的底层代码是相同的  那是我们的代码
But the underlying code in the game is the same. Our code.

837
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,760
盖  我是说  他进化的
And Guy, I mean, he has evolved way further

838
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,840
甚至超出了我们的想象
than we thought was even possible.

839
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,350
等等  你是说那个穿NPC皮肤的黑客吗
Wait, are you talking about the hacker in the NPC skin?

840
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:40,930
米莉  我说的是蓝衫男…
Millie, I'm talking about the fact that Blue Shirt Guy…

841
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,100
什么
Yeah?

842
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,690
他不是一个玩家
… is not a player.

843
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,940
他是一个认为自己是活人的算法
He is an algorithm who thinks he's alive.

844
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,280
我是说  见鬼  严格来说  他已经活了
I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.

845
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,490
他是第一个真正的人工智能
He is the first real artificial intelligence.

846
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,700
不 不可能  我知道
No! No. I know.

847
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,240
不 不 不  是真的 是真的
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah.

848
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,790
盖 我的那个盖吗  盖
Guy? My Guy? Guy.

849
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,120
那…   你的盖?
One who has been…  Your Guy?

850
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,410
老天爷…   这是一件好事
Holy…  This is a good thing.

851
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,080
不  糟透了
No, it's really bad.

852
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,420
米莉  他的代码  已经是原有大小的几千倍
Millie, his code, it's thousands of times the size it should be.

853
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:08,920
我们做到了  小米莉
We did it, Mills.

854
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:13,970
我们做到了  我们想要创造的一切  都实现了
We did it. Everything that we wanted to create, it actually happened.

855
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,050
好吧  你知道NPC也有私生活吗
Okay? Did you know that the NPCs have private lives?

856
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,100
其中一位咖啡师通过反复试验学会了如何做卡布奇诺
One of the baristas learned how to make a cappuccino through trial and error.

857
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,270
我是说  那真的很难  我甚至自己都不会做
I mean, that's really difficult. I can't even do that.

858
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,350
我早上甚至连自己的燕麦奶都泡不起来泡沫
I can't even froth my own oat milk in the morning.

859
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,060
而游戏中的巴姆谢尔这个角色
And the Bombshell character in the game

860
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,940
甚至写了一本回忆录  用以批判
wrote a memoir that's a searing indictment

861
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,820
性别歧视  批判父权制
of gender roles, the patriarchy…

862
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,780
尽管内容有点说教  但总体来说还是相当不错
It's a little preachy in parts, but overall, it's pretty good.

863
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:34,950
米莉  我们得庆祝一下
Millie, we have to celebrate!

864
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,860
不 这不可能  你在说什么
No, this can't be happening. What are you talking about?

865
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,530
这就是我们一直所努力的  不 我让他吻了我
This is what we've been working for! No, I let him kiss me!

866
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,500
所以  是的
So, yeah.

867
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,420
抱歉  等等  你让谁吻你了
I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?

868
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,630
盖
Guy.

869
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,750
盖?
Guy?

870
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,550
就像是我第一次吻了一个人畜无害的男人一样
The first time I kiss a nontoxic guy in like forever

871
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,340
而他甚至不是真人
and of course he's not even real!

872
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,850
呃  那上面没有亲吻的按键
Uh, there's not a button for that.

873
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,180
哦  他找到按钮了
Oh, he found the button.

874
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,810
好吧  是的
Okay. Yeah.

875
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,190
我真是 我太困惑了  为什么这么热
I am…  I'm so confused. Why is it so hot?

876
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,520
而且我非常好奇
And surprisingly curious.

877
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,900
你让一个人工智能
You let an artificially intelligent

878
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,690
一个电子游戏的角色吻了你?  哦 好的
video game character kiss you? Oh, okay,

879
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,780
你能不能别再这么说了
can you just stop saying it like that?

880
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,320
然后你觉得那会是…
And then you thought that would be…

881
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,360
因为你得见见他  凯斯
Because you have got to meet him, Keys.

882
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,490
他很有趣  很可爱  而且很帅
He's funny, and he's sweet, and he's so handsome.

883
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,910
哦  天哪  我终于说出来了
Oh, my God, now I'm saying it out loud.

884
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,540
而且  米莉  好好想想  他才四岁
Also, Millie, food for thought, he's like four.

885
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,830
真的吗 你非要说这些吗  真的
Really? You're gonna do that? Really.

886
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,630
哇  你刚才说的太吓人了
Wow, you just made that really creepy.

887
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,380
米莉  把这些都放在一边  不管是不是很奇怪  如果人们知道了这件事
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or not, when people find out about this,

888
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,050
你可能会赢得诺贝尔奖  哦  天哪
you could win a Nobel Prize. Oh, God.

889
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,220
什么
What?

890
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,760
哦  天哪  如果他们看到这个
Oh, my God, if they see this…

891
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,510
什么 怎么了  哦
What? What is it? Oh!

892
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,020
安特万啊  还能有谁
Antwan. What else?

893
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,980
他撒了谎  他谎称使用上了我们的代码
He's lying. He lied about using our code,

894
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,230
他一直在撒谎说这个游戏是向后兼容的
he's been lying about the game being backwards compatible.

895
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,730
我认为他在“自由之城1”的问题上撒了谎
I think he's lying about Free City 1.

896
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,860
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

897
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,860
看  你看  这里没有任何任务  也没有任何地点
Look. You see? There's not one mission, not one location…

898
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,070
我的意思是  这里连自由之城1中的一个角色都没有
I mean, there's not even a single character from Free City 1 on here.

899
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,660
自由之城2不是最新版本
Free City 2 is not an update…

900
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,120
而是个替代品  没错
It's a replacement. Exactly.

901
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,910
所以当自由之城2周一上映时
So when Free City 2 launches on Monday…

902
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,370
蓝衫男  所有的证据  包括我们的代码  一切都将被删除
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code, everything will be deleted.

903
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,790
他不能这么做
He can't do that.

904
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,130
我是说  我们现在面对的是有着自我意识的人工智能  这太疯狂了
I mean, this is artificial life we're dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

905
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,920
我们完蛋了
We're screwed.

906
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,220
也许不会
Maybe not.

907
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,840
如果我们能在游戏中找到我们最初的版本
If we can find our original build in the game,

908
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,680
这就能证明安特万在没有正当许可的情况下使用了我们的代码
it'll prove that Antwan used our code without properly licensing it.

909
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,020
我们必须要在自由之城2推出之前找到它
And we just have to find it before Free City 2 launches.

910
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,430
我们还有48小时
We have 48 hours.

911
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,020
我找过了  凯斯  你知道的
I've looked, Keys. You know I have.

912
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,310
我知道你找过了
I know you have.

913
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,860
但现在我们都知道蓝衫男的事了
But now that we both know about Blue Shirt Guy,

914
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,520
也许他能帮上忙
maybe he can help?

915
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,440
那就意味着我得告诉他
That would mean I'd have to tell him.

916
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,990
米莉  续作一推出他就将不复存在了
Millie, he's not gonna exist once the sequel launches.

917
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,620
他的整个世界就要毁灭了
His whole world's about to end.

918
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,490
你不觉得他会想要一个拯救它的机会吗
Don't you think he'd want a chance to save it?

919
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,750
给你  谢谢你
Here you go. Thank you.

920
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,920
不客气  盖
You got it. Guy?

921
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,790
盖  我们得谈谈
Guy, we need to talk.

922
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,550
你的声音怎么了  你的澳大利亚口音呢
What's going on with your voice? Where's your Australian accent?

923
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,710
我是英国人
British.

924
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,760
我想我一看到澳大利亚口音就知道了
I think I know an Australian accent when I see one.

925
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,010
我把变声器关掉了
I turned off the accent filter.

926
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,560
这就是我
This is me.

927
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,010
好的
Good.

928
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,230
听着  我得告诉你一件非常重要的事
Look, I have to tell you something really important.

929
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,480
你结婚了吗
Are you married?

930
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,560
没有
No.

931
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,060
哦  上帝
Oh, God.

932
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,070
那才是有史以来最糟糕的事情
That would have been like the worst thing ever.

933
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,860
也许那不是最糟糕的事
Maybe not the worst thing.

934
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,150
我要给你看点东西
I have to show you something.

935
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,370
好吧
Okay.

936
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,790
哇
Wow!

937
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,920
我一直在想这里装的是什么
I always wondered what was in here.

938
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,290
观看杀戮时刻
Tune in to the Kill Cam

939
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,840
了解更多今日亮点
for more of today's highlights

940
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,630
自由城每一个血腥   弹痕累累的角落
of every bloody, bulletridden corner of Free City.

941
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,550
有人看到我的猫了吗
Has anyone seen my cat?

942
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,300
嘿  那是菲利斯  她总是弄丢她的猫
Hey, that's Phyllis. She's always losing her cats.

943
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,390
那是乔  他是我的朋友  我认识那个人
And there's Joe! He's my friend, I know that guy.

944
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,390
我还是不明白  这是什么地方
I don't get it. What is this place?

945
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,940
不知道该怎么跟你说  但这座城市是一场游戏
There is no easy way to say this, but this city is a game.

946
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,360
这么说不就简单明了吗  我知道这是场游戏
There's no easy way to say this, I know it's a game.

947
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,280
而且是你教我玩的
You taught me how to play it. Boopboop.

948
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,740
是的  你说得对  是我教的
Yes, you're right, I did.

949
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,950
但这不是像一场游戏  这实际上就是一场游戏
But it's not just that it's like a game. It is a game.

950
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,450
这是一款电子游戏  仅此而已
It's a video game. And that's all it is.

951
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,000
这么说整个世界都是一场游戏?
So the entire world is a game?

952
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,170
是的
Yes.

953
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,170
我们都只是游戏中的玩家吗
And we're all just players in the game?

954
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,420
不完全是
Not exactly.

955
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,880
我是个玩家
I'm a player.

956
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,260
这里所有的人都是玩家  我们生活在真实的世界里
All these people here are players. We live in the real world.

957
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,390
但你只存在于这里
But you only exist here.

958
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,140
这就是为什么你永远不能离开自由之城
It's why you can never leave Free City.

959
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,060
你就是我们所说的NPC
You're what we call an NPC.

960
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,390
NPC
NPC.

961
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,560
警察和那个大兔子
The policeman and the muscular bunny rabbit,

962
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:37,860
他们也这么叫我  什么是NPC
they called me that. What is an NPC?

963
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,020
我们  看看吧
Let's take…  Just watch.

964
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,110
再看一眼排行榜
… another look at that leaderboard.

965
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,940
所有人都趴在地上
Everybody get down on the ground!

966
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,650
别逞英雄
Nobody try to be a hero.

967
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,990
很快就会结束
This will all be over soon.

968
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,320
我不明白
I don't understand.

969
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,910
你是一个非玩家角色
You're a nonplayer character.

970
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,370
不  只是一个背景人物
Non…  A background person.

971
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,710
是人们设计来为真人增添乐趣的
Someone designed to make the game more fun for real people.

972
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,080
等等  等一下  停一下
Wait, hold on a second. Just stop for a second.

973
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,290
我想确认一下我理解的对不对
I wanna make sure I'm getting this straight.

974
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,420
我想彻底搞清楚
I just wanna fully understand here.

975
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,590
这么说  我是假的?
So, I'm fake?

976
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,470
整个世界都是假的?  我甚至连主角都算不上
The entire world is fake? I'm not even a main character,

977
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,970
只是个在幕后的白痴?
I'm just this idiot who's in the background?

978
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,060
米莉  你为什么要说这个  我爱你
Millie, why are you even saying this? I love you.

979
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,310
你喜欢我只是因为这份情感在你的程序里
You only think that because it's in your programming.

980
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,820
盖  我需要你听我说
Guy, I need you to listen to me.

981
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,660
再过两天  游戏就要停服了
In two days, the game is gonna shut down. For good.

982
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,330
当这部续作推出时  这儿的整个城市
When this sequel launches, this whole city,

983
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,830
你  包括这里所有非玩家的人
you, all the people in it who aren't players,

984
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,410
他们会永远消失  你得听我说
they'll be gone forever. You need to listen.

985
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,330
在我的一生中  我一直感觉我是非同凡响的
My whole life, I felt like there had to be something more.

986
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,210
然后我看到了你
And then I saw you.

987
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:43,710
我知道我是对的  我是对的
And I knew I was right. I was right!

988
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,130
有那么一秒钟  我感觉棒极了
And for a second, I felt amazing.

989
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,050
我知道  你不知道
I know. Except you don't know.

990
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,350
因为我们不一样
Because we're not the same.

991
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,720
你不是这么说的吗  这是你的原话啊
Isn't that what you said? You said that.

992
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,850
我们不一样
We're not the same.

993
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,440
你是真实的
You're real.

994
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,980
那我是什么  我是什么
And I'm what? I'm what?

995
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,030
你不是
You're not.

996
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,410
你不是
You're not.

997
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,490
嗯  我可能不是真的  但是有那么一秒钟…
Well, I may not be real, but for a second there…

998
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,790
我觉得自己很有活力
I felt pretty alive.

999
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,810
都是骗人的
It's all a lie!

1000
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,360
周五之前把季度报告放在我桌上
Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

1001
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,950
季度报告  天哪  多具体的商业术语啊
Quarterly reports. My, what specific business lingo.

1002
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,110
哇  大城市的生活  一点也不像
Wow. Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it.

1003
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,280
它会粉碎你的灵魂
Until it crushes your soul.

1004
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,830
有人看到我的猫子吗  有没有人看到我的…
Has anyone seen my cat? Has anyone seen my…

1005
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,870
你的猫?  不  菲利斯  我没见过
Your cats? No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

1006
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,960
但是有个一劳永逸的办法  把你那该死的门关好
But here's a revolutionary idea…  close your goddamn door.

1007
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,420
它们又不会一个接一个的叠罗汉
It's not like they're climbing on top of one another,

1008
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,710
形成一个小猫塔  然后撬锁溜出去
forming a little kitty tower, and then jimmying the locks.

1009
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,010
它们没有拇指  菲利斯
They don't have thumbs, Phyllis.

1010
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,680
没有拇指
No thumbs!

1011
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,470
你们还不明白吗  你们没有人明白吗
Don't you get it? Don't any of you get it?

1012
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,430
这些都是假的  啥也不是  都是假的  我们没有存在的必要
None of this matters! None of it! It's fake! We don't matter!

1013
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,440
那栋楼  是假的  这条街…
That building, that's fake! This street…

1014
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,810
是假的
It's fake!

1015
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,070
那辆车…
That car…

1016
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,740
约翰尼警官
Officer Johnny!

1017
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,070
祝你今天开心  盖
Have a good one, Guy.

1018
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,000
哦  嘿  呃…
Oh, hey, uh…

1019
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,670
进来吧
Come in.

1020
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,060
给你吧
Here you go.

1021
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,220
谢谢
Thank you.

1022
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,350
巴迪
Buddy,

1023
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,900
如果你发现你不是真实存在的  你会怎么做
what would you do if you found out that you weren't real?

1024
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,480
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

1025
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,110
假设一下
Pretend with me.

1026
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,860
好的  那么
Okay, so…

1027
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,700
我可以假装我是鬼魂吗
Can I pretend I'm a ghost?

1028
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,200
好的
Sure.

1029
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,660
噢  那我要现在这个样子呢  还是要扮成我死的样子
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now? Or whenever I die?

1030
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:04,960
就好比  我是不是应该穿着丧服
Like, do I have a funeral outfit on?

1031
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,080
在举行葬礼  那不要紧
This is kind of funeral…  Doesn't matter.

1032
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,080
但就穿工作服吧  因为我打了领带
… but even though it's a work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

1033
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,000
我们讨论的重点不在这  好吗
Let's move on from the concept, okay?

1034
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,630
明白
Got it.

1035
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,720
我不是鬼魂  太失望了
I'm not a ghost. I'm very disappointed,

1036
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,260
但我懂了  好的
but I get it. Yeah.

1037
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:21,930
我就是我  现在的我  我只是想帮助一个朋友
I'm me, who I am right now, and I'm just trying to help a friend.

1038
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,140
我说  好吧  如果我不是真实存在的又能如何呢
I say, okay, so what if I'm not real?

1039
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,690
什么叫“又能如何？”
I'm sorry. "So what?"

1040
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:29,860
嗯  又能如何呢
Yeah. So what?

1041
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,820
但如果你不是真的
But if you're not real,

1042
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,490
这难道不意味着你所做的一切都毫无意义吗
doesn't that mean that nothing you do matters?

1043
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,530
什么意思啊  听着  兄弟  我坐在这里
What does that mean? Look, brother, I am sitting here

1044
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,080
和我最好的朋友一起试着帮他渡过难关
with my best friend, trying to help him get through a tough time.

1045
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:46,040
对吗  即使我不是真实存在的  起码这一刻  我是真实的
Right? And even if I'm not real, this moment is.

1046
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,710
就在这里  就在此刻  这一刻是真实的
Right here, right now. This moment is real.

1047
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,670
我是说  还有什么比一个人试图帮助他们所爱的人更真实的呢
I mean, what's more real than a person tryin' to help someone they love?

1048
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:01,390
如果这不是真实存在的  我不知道什么才是真的
Now, if that's not real, I don't know what is.

1049
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,180
你认识其他保安吗
Do you know the other security guards?

1050
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,020
我都认识啊  怎么了
I know 'em all. Why?

1051
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,400
嘿  巴迪
Hey, Buddy…

1052
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,560
我不会祝我们今天开心
let's not have a good day…

1053
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,230
我要祝我们今天非常开心
let's have a great day.

1054
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,030
盖  我们来这里做什么
Guy, what are we doin' here?

1055
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,660
我们是来给我的朋友米莉找那个视频片段的
We're here to get a video clip for my friend Millie.

1056
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,160
这看起来不吓人吗
Does this look intimidating?

1057
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,740
我不知道  盖  你怎么找到这玩意儿的
I don't know, Guy. How do you hold this thing?

1058
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,340
你有我想要的东西
You have something I want.

1059
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,590
你得把它交出来
And you're gonna hand it over.

1060
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,010
你怎么进来的
How'd you get in here?

1061
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,430
放轻松  我认识你们的保安
Easy. I know your security guard.

1062
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,050
吉米?
Jimmy?

1063
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,390
他的名字叫路易吉
His name is Luigi.

1064
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,140
所以如果你花点时间记他的名字…
So if you took some time to learn his name…

1065
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,930
也许他不会这么快背叛你
maybe he wouldn't turn on you so quick.

1066
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,400
我需要一段视频片段  你得给我
I need a video clip, and you're gonna give it to me.

1067
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,610
等等  你是不是…
Wait a minute, are you…

1068
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,690
你是蓝衫男吗
Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

1069
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,900
是啊  也许吧
Yeah, maybe.

1070
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,950
天啊  你是盖  你是蓝衫男  是你啊
Holy shit! You're Guy! You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

1071
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,200
是的  我爱你
Yeah. I love you.

1072
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,660
是吗  我是说
You do? I mean…

1073
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,160
我就像一个粉丝  你太棒了
I'm like a fan. You're awesome.

1074
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,370
你想要什么尽管拿
You can have anything you want.

1075
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,540
等等  等一下
Wait, hold on one second.

1076
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,620
玩家们  听好了  我是雷文杰明·巴顿
Gamers, listen up, this is Revenjamin Buttons here.

1077
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:10,790
我和盖在一起
I'm here with Guy.

1078
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,380
这个盖  他在我的藏身之处  他是来抢劫我的
The Guy, he's in my stash house, and he's here to rob me.

1079
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:14,630
我能不能要一点…
Can I get a little…

1080
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,920
什么纪念品之类的给我粉丝们 盖  什么
"whatwhat" for my followers, Guy? What?

1081
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:19,590
太棒了  好的  那么现在发生的情况是这样.…
Perfect. All right, so what's happening is…

1082
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,340
盖在找一个片段视频…
Guy's looking for a clip…

1083
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,050
关于我达到神秘等级的漫步的视频
showing a walkthrough I did to get to the secret level.

1084
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,390
你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

1085
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,310
对不起
I'm sorry.

1086
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,560
我在跟谁说话? 这真是一句经典的盖的台词
Who am I talking to? It's just such a classic Guy line.

1087
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,650
对吗
Right?

1088
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,230
你很棒  哦  不管怎样
You're good. Oh, anyway…

1089
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,650
而你  你想和那个莫洛托夫小妞一起从我这里偷走它
And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick.

1090
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,820
她叫米莉
Her name's Millie.

1091
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,160
是的 等等 是谁  米莉
Yeah. Wait, who? Millie.

1092
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,490
我觉得进展得很顺利
I think it's going really well.

1093
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,950
我知道呀  这真的是我第一次把枪从枪套里拿出来
I know. This is literally the first time I took my gun out the holster.

1094
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,160
是吗
Totally. Right?

1095
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,710
盖  我本来想回滚记录  但故障已经修补好了
Guy, I tried to go back through, but the glitch is patched.

1096
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,080
我再也没有找到它
And I never found it again.

1097
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,040
所以我是唯一一个看到过另一边是什么的人
So I'm the only one that ever saw what was on the other side.

1098
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,710
但都在这里了  看看吧
But it's all here, check it out.

1099
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,760
事实上  这帅呆了  就像是一个完全不同的世界
It's pretty cool actually. It's like a whole other world.

1100
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,760
就是这个吗 这就是游戏片段吗  对 就是这个
This is it? This is the game clip? Yeah, that's it.

1101
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:07,140
你能为我做一件事吗  就一件
Can you do one, single, just one solid for me?

1102
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,600
就一件事 我不会再多要求 好吗  好的
One thing, I'll stop asking, okay? Yeah.

1103
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,680
只要说出我的口号就行了
Just say my catchphrase.

1104
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,140
如果你这么说  我的观众会把香蕉奶油三明治弄得浑身都是
My viewers will just banana cream sandwich all over themselves if you say it.

1105
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,850
我喜欢香蕉奶油三明治
I love banana cream sandwiches.

1106
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,020
不是这种香蕉奶油三明治
Maybe not this banana cream sandwich.

1107
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,150
是的  这种
Yeah, this one.

1108
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,400
好的  太好了  好的  那就说“你知道现在是什么时刻吗”
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just say, "You know what time it is?"

1109
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,690
你知道现在是什么时刻吗  你知道现在是什么时刻吗
You know what time it is? You know what time it is?

1110
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:21,860
你知道现在是什么时刻吗
You know what time it is?

1111
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,030
你知道现在是什么时刻吗
You know what time it is?

1112
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,320
你知道现在是什么时刻吗
You know what time it is?

1113
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,700
你知道现在是什么时刻吗
You know what time it is?

1114
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,200
你知道现在是什么时刻吗
You know what time it is?

1115
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,330
现在是犯罪时刻  宝贝  嗯
It's crime o'clock, baby. Yeah.

1116
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,700
现在是犯罪…
It's crime o'cl…

1117
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,120
但是  不  我不能这么说  那是…
But, no, I can't say that. That's…

1118
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,250
好吧  没事的  我自己说就好
Okay. It's all right. I'll say it myself.

1119
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,250
好吧 你知道现在是什么时刻吗  不知道
All right, you know what time it is? No.

1120
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,290
现在是犯罪… 妈妈
It's crime o'cl…  Mom!

1121
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,750
妈妈  你是认真的吗…
Mom! Are you serious with the…

1122
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,130
非得现在用吸尘器吗
vacuum right now?

1123
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,420
你真的要现在拖地吗  我正在说…
You really have to do that here? I'm saying my…

1124
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:44,880
我的口号呢  大家都在看呢
catchphrase! Everybody's watching!

1125
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,220
上帝啊  你22岁了
God! You're 22,

1126
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,930
还住在我的房子里  我家没有上帝
living in my house, there is no God!

1127
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,010
抱歉  盖
Sorry, Guy.

1128
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,220
谢谢你  巴顿先生  我们要走了
Thank you, Mr. Buttons. We're gonna go.

1129
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,980
不  不  不  你必须杀了我
No, no, no! No, you gotta kill me.

1130
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,850
抱歉 你说什么  你得杀了我 请杀了我吧
I'm sorry, what? You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

1131
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,310
杀了我吧  老爹  杀了我
Give it to me, Daddy. Give it to me!

1132
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,650
不  不要那样做  不要那样做
No. Please don't do that. Please don't do that.

1133
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,820
我们不会伤害任何人的  我是个好人
We're not gonna hurt anybody. I'm a good guy.

1134
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,360
什么  你说什么
What? What'd you say?

1135
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,160
这话里有话啊
That's deep.

1136
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,320
不  没有
No, it's not.

1137
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:10,490
我能感觉到  很深邃
That's like I can taste you, deep.

1138
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:14,460
我需要你的帮助  巴迪  我没有安全口令
I want your help, Buddy. I don't have the safeword.

1139
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,540
我知道你想要什么
I know what you want.

1140
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,750
我不想要
I don't want that.

1141
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:17,830
不  你想要
Yeah, you do.

1142
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,080
太近了
That's touching.

1143
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,380
太近了  是的
They're touching. Yeah.

1144
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
我知道你想要什么
I know what you want.

1145
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,380
是的  我知道
Yes, I do.

1146
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,300
你想看看自由之城的痒痒猫吗
You want a little bit of that Free City Itchy Kitty.

1147
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,050
不  嗯 嗯 不 你想
No. Uhhuh. Yes, you do.

1148
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,050
您的动作太恶心了
The way you move, it's almost dirty.

1149
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,470
来个小小的萨诺斯手套舞怎么样
What about a little Thanos Glove…

1150
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,230
转成萨诺斯啪啪啪?
into a little bit of Thanos Snap?

1151
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,140
哦 看起来很疼  是啊 有点
Oh. That looked like it hurt. Yeah, a little bit.

1152
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,480
来段周圆驾车舞怎么样
A little Sunday Drive.

1153
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,190
你这房子真漂亮
You have a beautiful home.

1154
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,690
蛇人舞呢 不行吗 不喜欢蛇人吗  再见 巴顿先生
Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man? Bye, Mr. Buttons.

1155
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,240
拜托  给我来段蛇舞  拜托  伙计
Come on, give me one snake! Just come on, man.

1156
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,360
妈妈  别碰那只袜子
Mom! Do not touch that sock!

1157
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,160
我向上帝发誓  如果你碰那只袜子
I swear to God, if you touch that sock…

1158
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,330
你下半辈子就得去疗养院呆着了
you will be in therapy for the rest of your life!

1159
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:55,700
不  那不是普通的袜子  快放下
No! That's my special sock! Put it down!

1160
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,040
米莉  拜托
Millie, please.

1161
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,920
请你从昏迷中醒来
Please wake up from your standing coma.

1162
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,550
听着  我知道这个世界对你来说只是个游戏
Look, I know this world is just a game to you

1163
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,640
你可来去自如  但对我来说…
and you can come and go, but to me…

1164
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,180
这个地方  这些人  就是我的全部
this place, these people, that's all I have.

1165
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,390
如果我帮你可以拯救这儿  那我必须这么做
And if I can help you save it, I wanna do that…

1166
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,930
但你得醒醒  拜托
but you gotta wake up, please.

1167
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,730
米莉  我很抱歉  我当时离开了
Millie, I'm sorry for running away.

1168
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,560
盖
Guy?

1169
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,770
哦  吓死我了
Oh, that's so scary! It's just terrifying.

1170
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,980
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

1171
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,150
我很抱歉  我很抱歉
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1172
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,240
听着  你可能一开始就生活在幕后  但我也是
Look, you may have started out living in the background, but so did I.

1173
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,160
我们已经受够了
We're done with that.

1174
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:33,950
我给你准备了一份礼物
I got you a present.

1175
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,500
我没时间把它包起来
I didn't have time to wrap it.

1176
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,710
什么
What?

1177
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:50,090
他们说每年有超过10亿名NPC被杀害
They say over a billion NPCs are killed every year.

1178
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:54,890
现在  我坦白说  那至少有50%是我的错
Now, I'm not gonna lie, that's at least 50% my fault.

1179
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,390
我以前把所有次要角色都杀了个遍
I used to shoot all the secondary characters

1180
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,980
因为那时候很无聊  你知道吗
when I was bored, you know?

1181
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:03,480
然后  我会羞辱他们
And then, I'd teabag 'em a little bit.

1182
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,360
见鬼  谁知道这个蓝衫男是谁
Who the hell even knows who this Blue Shirt Guy is?

1183
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:08,490
但我要告诉你  他让我想到了NPC
But I'll tell you this, he's got me thinkin'

1184
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,240
以及我是怎么玩这个游戏的
about NPCs and how I play the game.

1185
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,530
这个游戏不是为这样的人设计的  不是为了让玩家成为一个好人
The game wasn't even made for someone like this, for a player to be a good guy.

1186
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,870
他也是一个非常可爱的家伙
He's also a really cute guy.

1187
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:18,700
不仅仅是脸  你知道的  真个人都很可爱
And not just the face, you know, like the whole thing.

1188
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,750
老实说  这让我意识到…
And, honestly, it's got me realizing…

1189
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:23,420
也许我们对NPC的看法一直是错误的
maybe we've been thinking about NPCs wrong this whole time.

1190
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,460
我认为蓝衫男就像一个符号  你知道吗
I think Blue Shirt Guy's like a symbol, you know?

1191
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,340
就像  也许人们可以在里面随心所欲
Like, maybe people can be whatever they want.

1192
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,880
他就像一个偶像  这个词对吗
He's like an icon. Is that the right word?

1193
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:31,930
因为  他提醒了我们一切皆有可能
Like, he reminds us of what's possible.

1194
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:33,430
还有  他简直性感到爆炸
Also, he's like crazy hot.

1195
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:36,600
哦  天哪  真的是  我都迷上那一堆像素了
Oh, my God, totally. I'd hit those pixels hard.

1196
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,020
我们都应该向蓝衫男学习
We should all be more like Blue Shirt Guy.

1197
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,520
也许我们应该停止杀戮
Maybe we just stop the killing.

1198
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,890
他死定了  听到了吗
He's dead! You hear me?

1199
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:43,600
那个家伙  把他放出来
The guy, put him up here.

1200
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,060
把他放在屏幕上  把他放到屏幕上
Put him up here on the screen. Put him on the screen.

1201
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:49,780
让我见见他  他在这啊
Make me see him. There he is.

1202
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,490
是  这就是他  那个小小的实干家
Yes. There he is, the little dogooder.

1203
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,910
我还以为你喜欢蓝衫男呢
I thought you liked Blue Shirt.

1204
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,870
别跟我说话
Don't say words to me!

1205
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:58,950
人们都忙着在Twitch和YouTube上看这个失败者
People are so busy watching this loser on Twitch and YouTube.

1206
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,120
你们知道他们忘了做什么吗  伙计们
You know what they're not doing, guys?

1207
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,580
忘了购买自由之城2
Buying Free City 2.

1208
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,620
预售直接下降16%  是60%
Presales are down 16%. 60.

1209
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,580
60%  完犊子了
60. That's bad.

1210
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,130
哦  我们离推出还剩48小时
Oh, we are 48 hours from launch.

1211
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,010
是啊  他像病毒一样迅速走红
Yeah, he's gone viral.

1212
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:13,840
是啊  一种同时让我屁眼和蛋蛋都难受的病毒
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass and ball cancer at the same time!

1213
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,890
而且无可救药
Inoperable!

1214
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,600
你知道吗  这个好人套路
You know, this whole good guy routine…

1215
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,560
这是一个非常不好的影响  对特许经营权影响恶劣
it is a bad influence, and is bad for the franchise.

1216
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:24,060
我要他滚蛋  我不管他是谁  把他踢出去
I want him gone. I don't care who it is, boot him.

1217
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,230
你不能这么做
You can't.

1218
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,020
哦  抱歉  你说什么
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1219
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,190
你不能这么做
You can't.

1220
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
为什么不行
Why not?

1221
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,320
因为他不是黑客  安特万  他是NPC
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan. He's an NPC.

1222
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,240
你难道是想告诉我
You're tryin' to tell me that all this shit

1223
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,370
关于有自我意识的NPC的传言是真的吗
about a selfaware NPC is real?

1224
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,580
嗯  我也不知道是怎么回事  也不知道为什么  但他是真实存在的
Yeah. I don't know how or why, but he's real.

1225
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,540
我该怎么办呢
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

1226
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:47,250
好的  好的  好的
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1227
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,540
该怎么办呢  该怎么办呢  倒下去
What to do? What to do? Got it.

1228
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,630
再起来
And kipup!

1229
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,720
所以我们不能把他踢出游戏
So we can't kick him out of the game.

1230
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,680
我们怎么重置他的Al算法呢  想想办法啊  各位  赶快
How do we reset his AI? Ideas, people. Come on.

1231
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,970
快给我想办法
Hit me. Ideas.

1232
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,020
您只需重新启动服务器即可
You could just reboot the server.

1233
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,270
继续说
Keep talking.

1234
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,690
如果我们重启服务器…
If we reboot the server…

1235
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,610
然后他就会变回一个普通的NPC
then he's just gonna revert back to a regular nonplayer guy.

1236
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,150
然后就解决了  安特万
Solution. Antwan.

1237
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,740
安特万  你是要终止…
Antwan, you're talking about terminating…

1238
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,570
第一个被证实的
the first confirmed artificially intelligent

1239
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:16,700
有着独立意识的人工智能吗
lifeform right now, okay?

1240
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,320
亲爱的  亲爱的  嘘
Honey, honey. Shush.

1241
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,490
他让我赔钱了
He's losing me money.

1242
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:24,080
所以我不在乎他是不是他妈的阿诺·施瓦辛格
So, I don't care if he's ArnoldFrickin'SchwarzenVader.

1243
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,750
终结他  重启
Terminate him. Reboot.

1244
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,500
这就去办  你不能那样做
On it. You can't do that.

1245
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:28,670
重启
Reboot!

1246
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,400
他的身体真有表现力
He's very expressive with his body.

1247
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,480
很明显
Clearly.

1248
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,770
那是什么
What is that?

1249
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,230
那边是一个全新的世界
It's a whole new world over there.

1250
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,610
天堂之类的什么
Some kinda paradise and shit.

1251
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,360
哦  天哪  就是这个
Oh, my God, that's it.

1252
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:59,870
这是我们的原始版本  该版本证明我们的代码在游戏中
It's our original build and that build is proof our code is in the game.

1253
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,030
你不知道我等这一刻等了多久
You have no idea how long I've waited for this.

1254
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,540
我见过这个地方
I've seen this place.

1255
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,000
什么
What?

1256
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,710
嗯
Yeah.

1257
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,960
你是什么意思  你怎么可能见过它呢
What do you mean? How could you have possibly seen it?

1258
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,260
米莉  米莉
Millie? Millie?

1259
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,560
重启了  自由之城已处于离线状态
We're dark. Free City is offline.

1260
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:17,320
发生什么事了
What is happening?

1261
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,610
自 由  之 城
离线

1262
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,570
再见  蓝衫男
Byebye, Blue Shirt.

1263
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,030
不  不  不
No, no, no.

1264
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:42,010
自 由  之 城
重启中

1265
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,050
没事了  快点
It's okay. Come on.

1266
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:53,270
自 由  之 城
加载中

1267
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,230
快点啊
Come on.

1268
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,810
拜托  拜托
Come on, come on, come on.

1269
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:02,950
早上好  元宝
Good morning, Goldie.

1270
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,250
前方的枪声
Front of warm, dry gunfire…

1271
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:11,960
与下午晚些时候的刺杀事件牵连在了一起
mixed with late afternoon stabbings…

1272
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,000
在哪可能会让你再街上沾满无辜者的鲜血…
could leave you in the streets wet with the blood of innocents…

1273
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,130
星期二晚上早些时候
by early Tuesday night.

1274
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:18,880
浅色烤肉和深色烤肉到底有什么不同
What really is the difference between a light roast and a dark roast?

1275
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,670
没人知道
Nobody knows.

1276
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,340
我不会祝你今天开心  我要祝你今天非常开心
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

1277
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:23,630
盖  我们能谈谈吗
Guy, can we talk?

1278
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,890
那个戴墨镜的女孩怎么知道你的名字
How does the sunglass girl know your name?

1279
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:25,970
我不知道  继续走
I don't know. Keep walking.

1280
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,390
拜托  盖  你认识我的
Come on, Guy! You know me.

1281
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,560
你知道这个吧
You know this.

1282
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,310
你说这个片段里显示了一个你以前见过的地方
You said this clip showed a place you'd seen before.

1283
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:32,480
我需要知道在哪里
I need to know where.

1284
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,060
数据已经被删除了  但它在你的脑海里
The data's been erased, but it's in your head.

1285
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:37,980
试着想一想  这真的很重要
Please try to remember. This is really important.

1286
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:41,990
拜托  盖  想一想  冰激凌  秋千
Please, Guy, think. The ice cream, the swings?

1287
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,360
哦  我们盖喜欢荡秋手呢
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

1288
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,610
在自由城港回公园  那里有一个很棒的秋千
At Free City Harbor Park, there's a great swing set there.

1289
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,780
你去过吗  去过
Have you been? Yes.

1290
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:48,280
我们吃了泡沫口香糖冰淇淋
We had bubble gum ice cream.

1291
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,160
天哪  我爱泡沫口香糖冰淇淋
OMG, I love bubble gum ice cream!

1292
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,750
他喜欢泡沫口香糖冰淇淋
He loves the bubble gum ice cream.

1293
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,870
是的  我知道  我们一起吃的  记得吗
Yes, I know. We had it together, remember?

1294
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,460
拜托  盖  只有你能帮我了
Please, Guy, you're all I've got.

1295
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:05,380
我很抱歉  女士  我想你找错人了
I'm sorry, lady. I think you have the wrong guy.

1296
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,850
我不会祝你今天开心  我要祝你今天非常开心
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

1297
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:23,900
喂
Hello?

1298
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,070
我可能发现了点东西
I might've found something.

1299
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:28,410
我一直在检查盖的代码  那儿有一些东西
I've been going through Guy's code and there is something there…

1300
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,620
即使是现在  在抹除之后
even now, after the wipe.

1301
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,700
这有什么意义呢
What's the point?

1302
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:34,500
这家伙简直是十亿分之一的奇迹  我们无法再复制
Guy was, like, a oneinabillion miracle. We can't replicate that.

1303
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,330
我试过了  好吗  你说得对  一切都结束了
I tried, okay? You were right, it's over.

1304
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,080
不  米莉  米莉  你没明白我的意思  好吗
No, Millie, Millie, you're not listening to me, all right?

1305
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,130
重启  不会删除他的人工智能代码…
A reboot, it doesn't erase his AI coding…

1306
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,460
实际上  只有摧毁服务器才行
you literally would have to destroy the servers to do that.

1307
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:47,010
他的AI系统仍然在那里  只需要访问它
His AI is still there, it just needs to be accessed.

1308
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,180
我刚才见了他  凯斯  他什么都忘了
I've seen him, Keys. He's forgotten everything.

1309
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,510
看看我发给你的追踪日志
Just look at the trace log I sent you.

1310
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,260
那个可以解释一切
It'll explain everything.

1311
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,450
现在  从头开始…
Now, from the beginning…

1312
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:11,410
盖的行为比应有的复杂得多
Guy's behavior is much more complex than it should be,

1313
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,200
得归功于我们的代码
thanks to our code.

1314
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:17,210
但他仍然被困在自由城  他仍然困在这个生活  这个循环里
But he's still stuck in Free City. He's still stuck in this life, this loop.

1315
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:21,000
然后  有些事情发生了变化  他有了独立的意识  这是为什么
And then, something changes. He comes to life. Why?

1316
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,960
然后我想起来了
And then I remembered.

1317
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,760
《生活本身》中的一个角色是这个我昵称为“失恋”的人
One of the characters from Life Itself was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.

1318
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,930
他是那种生来就不会遇到真命天女的人
And he was someone who was designed to never meet the right person.

1319
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:33,350
从本质上讲  是这个角色的基石
It was essentially the building blocks of the character.

1320
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:37,520
但他从未停止过希望能遇见“他的梦中情人”
But he never stopped hoping that he would meet "the girl of his dreams."

1321
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,230
所以我不得不让这个女孩依靠某人…
So I had to base this girl off of someone…

1322
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:43,020
还有谁比我每天坐在旁边的人更好的呢
and who better than the person that I was sitting next to every day?

1323
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:44,190
也就是你
You.

1324
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,860
但是后来有一天…
But then, one day…

1325
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:48,490
他在自由城和你见面  一旦他见到你…
he meets you in Free City, and once he sees you…

1326
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,070
他永远不可能再是原来的他了
he can never be the same.

1327
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,990
他本应感觉到自己死定了  但相反  他觉得自己活了
He was supposed to feel doomed, but instead, he feels alive…

1328
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,790
所以到最后  他有了自我意识  真的活过来了
until eventually, he is alive.

1329
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,210
是你改变了他  米莉
You changed him, Millie.

1330
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:04,670
你更改了他的代码  我想你可以再来一次
You changed his code. And I think you can do it again.

1331
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,050
是你让他起死回生的  米莉
You brought him to life, Millie.

1332
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:10,220
是你让他重获新生的
You brought him to life.

1333
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,720
他能有独立的意识是因为他遇到了一个人…
And he was alive because he met the one person…

1334
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,640
我不会祝你今天过得开心…
Don't have a good day…

1335
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,810
我会祝你今天过得非常的开心
have a great day.

1336
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,100
谢谢
Thank you.

1337
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,640
保重
Take care.

1338
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,230
所有人都趴在地上
Everybody down on the ground!

1339
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:25,110
别逞英雄  很快就会结束
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

1340
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:26,270
好吧
Okay.

1341
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,940
除了你之外的所有人
Everybody except you.

1342
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,200
门  门  门  我打开了
Door, door, door. I got it.

1343
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,620
拜托  我养了一条金鱼
Please, I have a goldfish.

1344
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,910
听着  我没多少时间了
Look, I don't have long.

1345
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,200
我刚把你扣为人质  所以我现在被三星通缉
I just took you hostage, so there are three badges on me.

1346
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,160
三星通缉? 这是什么女童子军该干的是吗
Badges? Is that like a Girl Scout thing? What is that?

1347
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,250
你体内有某种东西  盖
There is something inside you, Guy.

1348
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,330
什么  我体内什么都没有
What? I don't want anything inside of me.

1349
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,420
他们把你塞进那家银行然后…
They stuck you in that bank and…

1350
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,540
希望你遵守规则…   我喜欢银行
expected you to just follow the rules…  I love the bank.

1351
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,380
每天都做同样的事情
… and do the same thing every day.

1352
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,540
你不该局限于此
You are so much more than that.

1353
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:48,630
我不想让你局限于此
I don't wanna be more than that.

1354
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,470
我需要你回想起那一切
No, and I need you to remember it.

1355
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,630
你为什么跟踪我  你怎么知道我的名字
Why have you been following me and how do you know my name?

1356
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,720
把这个戴上
Put these on.

1357
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,350
我才不要做任何我不想做的事
I don't have to do anything that I don't wanna do.

1358
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,600
没错  你自己选吧
True. The choice is totally yours.

1359
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,470
好吧  好吧  很好
Okay. Okay. Fine.

1360
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,440
抢  劫  银  行

1361
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,440
抢  劫  银  行

1362
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,270
那是什么
What is that?

1363
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,150
这是什么  这是什么诡异的眼镜
What are these? Trick glasses or something?

1364
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:09,230
仔细听好了
Listen carefully.

1365
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,200
在24小时内  这个世界  你认识的每一个人
In 24 hours, this world, everyone you know,

1366
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,490
一切都会永远消失
it's all gonna disappear for good.

1367
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,120
你能让我走吗
Can you please just let me go?

1368
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,700
我是说  我甚至都没见过你的脸
I mean, I haven't really even seen your face.

1369
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,160
我是说  我虽然看到了你的脸
I mean, I've seen the general area,

1370
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,830
但我不太会用描述性词语来形容你的长相
but I'm not really good with descriptive words.

1371
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,370
一般来说  我不太擅长用词
Not really good with words in general.

1372
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,080
去他妈的  什么 噢
Screw it. What? Oh!

1373
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,250
我记起来了
I remember.

1374
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,710
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

1375
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,300
不  我什么都记起来了
No. I remember everything.

1376
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,090
跟我来吧
Come with me.

1377
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,010
我每天都这么做  我都忘了为什么了
I do this every day so much, I'd forgotten why.

1378
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,890
你看到了吗
Do you see that?

1379
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,520
就在那里
Right there.

1380
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,560
天哪
Oh, my God.

1381
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,480
天哪
Oh, my God!

1382
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:31,190
安特万把我们最初的建模隐藏在地平线之外  所以才看不见了
Antwan hid our original build past the horizon, making it invisible…

1383
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,530
但他忘了抹除掉倒影
but he forgot to scrub the reflections.

1384
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,320
所以我们的原型还在外面  盖  只是看不到它
It's still out there, Guy. We just can't see it.

1385
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,120
如果我们能到那里  那就是我们需要的证据
If we can get there, that is the evidence we need.

1386
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,990
你不能越过水的边线的  我试过了
You can't go past the water line. I tried.

1387
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,200
我们需要帮助
We need help.

1388
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,500
安特万找到了一种把它藏在众圆睽睽之下的方法
Antwan found a way to hide it in plain sight

1389
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,580
把它放置在一个没有人能到达的地方
in the one place no one can even get to.

1390
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,750
我简直不敢相信
I can't even believe

1391
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:50,840
他真是太聪明了  所以才如此那恶
he's smart enough to be this diabolical.

1392
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,420
凯斯  我需要你集中精神
Keys, I need you to focus.

1393
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:56,090
好吧  所以  反射显示的是南边地平线上的建模
Okay. So, the reflection shows the build past the southern horizon.

1394
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,340
但是游戏的规则是不允许你通过海滩
But the game physics won't allow you past the beach.

1395
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:01,100
你觉得你能找到办法让我们越过边界网格吗
But you think you can find a way to get us past the collision mesh?

1396
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,180
我们需要一座桥
We're gonna need a bridge.

1397
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,520
你去刺客海滩  剩下的交给我
You just get to Hitman's Beach and I'll figure out the rest.

1398
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,890
对了  米莉
And, Millie?

1399
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,640
小心
Be careful.

1400
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,730
安特万可能很混蛋  但他不傻
Antwan may be an asshole, but he's not stupid.

1401
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,440
他如果知道你要做什么  他会不折手段的来对付你
He'll figure out what you're up to and he'll throw everything he's got at you.

1402
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,610
你说的对
You're right.

1403
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:17,030
嗯  嗨  米莉  还有其它的我看不见的人
Um, hi, Millie, and other person I can't see…

1404
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,490
嗯  我有个主意
well, I have an idea.

1405
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,410
如果他没有什么可以利用的了呢
What if he has nothing to throw?

1406
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,120
各位  围过来
Everyone! Gather around!

1407
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,960
谢谢大家光临
Thank you for coming.

1408
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,000
你们都知道  我是盖
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

1409
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,670
嗨  盖
Hi, Guy.

1410
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,340
嗨
Hi.

1411
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:36,970
我接下来要说的话可能很难理解
What I'm about to say may be hard to understand.

1412
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,260
真的很难理解
Really hard to understand.

1413
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:44,220
但是  你们厌倦生活在幕后吗
But, are you sick of living in the background?

1414
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,310
你们难道不厌倦被别人对着你开枪吗
Aren't you sick of being shot at?

1415
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:48,390
受够了
Enough.

1416
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,100
厌倦被劫持为人质吗  不想再被劫持了
Taken hostage? No more.

1417
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,480
被人踩在脚下?  我们受够了
Run over? We done with that.

1418
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,730
被抢劫  被刺伤  被用来做人肉盾牌
Robbed? Stabbed? Used as a human shield?

1419
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,280
我们厌倦了被刺伤
We are tired of being stabbed!

1420
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,610
巴迪  抱歉
Buddy! Sorry.

1421
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,400
你想说什么  盖
What are you trying to say, Guy?

1422
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:01,530
我想说的是这个城市不一定非得是这样的
I'm tryin' to say that things in this city don't have to be this way.

1423
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,740
可以变得有所不同一些
Things can be different.

1424
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:03,950
怎么个不同
Different how?

1425
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,540
首先 你可以把胳膊放下  是的
For starters, you can put your arms down. Yeah.

1426
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,620
这就对了  没问题的  嗯
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

1427
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,380
继续放  这就对了
Keep pushing. There you go.

1428
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,040
深呼吸  这就对了
Breathe through it. There you go.

1429
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,090
加油  加油
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1430
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,630
不  不行的
No, not gonna happen. Nope.

1431
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,880
这感觉很不自然
That feels unnatural.

1432
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,220
我是说  如果有人带着枪跑进来怎么办
I mean, what about when someone runs in with a gun?

1433
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,720
把我的胳膊举起来只是为了节省时间
Having my arms up is just a real time saver.

1434
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:28,600
不过  如果持枪的人不来怎么办
Except, what if the guy with the gun doesn't come?

1435
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:29,810
什么  什么
What? What?

1436
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,560
总会有一个带枪的人
There's always a guy with a gun.

1437
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,270
这么多人带着枪
So many guys with guns.

1438
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:37,110
各位  如果我们的世界不需要这么可怕呢
People, what if our world doesn't have to be so scary?

1439
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,190
如果我们可以改变它呢
What if we can change it?

1440
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:45,240
米莉  在你的世界里  每天有多少次银行被抢劫
Millie! How many times a day are the banks robbed in your world?

1441
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,830
几乎没有  盖
Hardly ever, Guy.

1442
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,790
那尸体呢  米莉
What about corpses, Millie?

1443
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:49,950
什么  你看过很多尸体吗
What? You see a lot of those?

1444
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,460
每小时就死几个人
How many an hour?

1445
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,040
没有  盖
None per hour, Guy.

1446
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,540
那枪支暴力呢
What about gun violence?

1447
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,750
在你的世界里看到过很多枪支暴力事件吗
See a lot of gun violence in your world?

1448
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,090
实际上  那是个大问题  盖  真的是个大问题
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy. It's a massive problem.

1449
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,010
我没想到你会这么说
I didn't see that coming.

1450
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,430
这是真的  真的很糟糕
It's true. It really sucks.

1451
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,850
关键是  我们不必成为自己生活的旁观者
The point is, we don't have to be spectators to our own lives.

1452
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,390
我们可以随心所欲
We can be whatever we want.

1453
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,060
我们不可能都变成你那样  盖
We can't all be you, Guy.

1454
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,520
胡说
That's not true.

1455
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,030
我能这样想  你也就能这样想
What's inside of me is inside of you, too.

1456
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:21,110
什么
What?

1457
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:24,160
自我意识就在你们每个人的体内  你们都在成长
It's inside of each and every one of you. You're growing.

1458
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,450
在我的生活中  我需要比煮咖啡多做一些别的事  我想做…
I need more in my life than drip coffee. I want to make…

1459
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,620
卡布奇诺
A cappuccino.

1460
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,370
这个世界需要一些不一样的东西
A goddamn difference in the world.

1461
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,700
需要很多很多的改变
Much, much better.

1462
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:32,870
再来一杯绿茶波巴
And a green tea boba.

1463
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,580
见鬼  没错
Holy shit! That's right!

1464
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,170
你去吧  姑娘
You go, girl.

1465
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,420
哦  天哪  你太棒了
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

1466
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,210
如果我能活着从那水里出来的话
If I could just make it out past that water…

1467
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,380
我希望我能回到一个属于我们的自由的世界
there's a world out there where we can be free.

1468
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,550
我希望在这  我们可以决定我们想成为什么样的人
Where we get to decide who we wanna be.

1469
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,010
可能我们会遇到些麻烦  但我们必须为之奋斗
Where we can matter. But we have to fight for it.

1470
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,930
我们必须齐心协力的奋斗
We have to fight together.

1471
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,390
嗯
Yeah!

1472
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,560
你们一直都在做别人期望你们做的事
You guys have always done what's expected of you.

1473
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:54,230
但那些破事今天就该结束了
But that shit ends today.

1474
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,350
嗯
Yeah!

1475
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,610
虽然我不知道现在是什么情况
I don't even know what's happening right now!

1476
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:58,690
但我喜欢这种感觉
But I love it!

1477
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,610
我喜欢
I love it!

1478
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,820
我喜欢
I love it!

1479
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,910
我也很喜欢  来吧  伙计们
I love it, too! Come on, guys, get in here!

1480
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:08,950
聚在一起  我们就是要聚在一起
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do! Everyone in!

1481
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,870
所有人都趴在地上
Everybody get down on the ground!

1482
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,010
喂
Hello?

1483
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,510
见鬼  人都去哪儿了
Where the hell is everybody?

1484
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,010
喂
Hello?

1485
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,360
所有的NPC都到哪里去了
Where are all the NPCs?

1486
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,830
我玩“自由之城”已经差不多三年了
Look, I've been playing Free City for, like, three years now.

1487
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,410
我从未见过这样的事情
I've never seen anything like this.

1488
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:58,790
直到最近  我才会注意到一些NPC丢失了
Up until recently, I don't even know if I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing.

1489
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,840
我不知道这是否只是一些疯狂的理论…
And I don't know if this is just some whack Reddit theory…

1490
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,630
但有人说蓝衫男甚至不是玩家
but some people are saying that Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.

1491
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,510
他是真正的人工智能  人工智能?
That he's actual AI. AI?

1492
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,140
有自我意识的人工智能  你懂的  有生命的
Actual AI. You know, alive.

1493
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:14,560
这就是为什么蓝衫男风靡全球的原因
It's why Blue Shirt Guy is trending everywhere.

1494
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,600
安特万  如果你正在看这个视频  请修复游戏
Antwan, if you're watching this, please fix the game.

1495
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:20,060
最重要的是 把蓝衫男给我们带回来  哦 天哪 天哪
And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt. Oh, my God. My God!

1496
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,560
安特万  你应该看看这个
Antwan, you should see this.

1497
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:27,200
而你  你试图和那个莫洛托夫小妞一起从我这里偷走它
And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick.

1498
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,280
她叫米莉  谁
Her name's Millie. Who?

1499
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,360
米莉
Millie.

1500
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:32,580
找到她了  找到她了  抓到你了  抓到你了
Got her. Got her! Got you! Got you!

1501
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,290
穆瑟  把他放到屏幕上  赶紧放上去
Mouser! Put him up on the screen. Now. Put him up.

1502
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,000
就这样  快点  快点
That's it. Come on, quicker.

1503
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,620
是的  他在那里
Yes, there he is.

1504
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:42,380
他和一个叫莫洛托夫的玩家在自由城兜风
He's joyriding around Free City with some player called Molotovgirl.

1505
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:45,380
那个女人真名叫米莉·拉斯克
AKA Millie Rusk.

1506
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:47,590
米莉·拉斯克  那不是凯斯的老搭档吗
Millie Rusk? Isn't that Keys' old partner?

1507
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:48,670
是
Yeah.

1508
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,970
也是那个想用这场虚假诉讼击败我的人
Also the one who's trying to hit me with this bogus lawsuit…

1509
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,430
因为她不顾一切地想要分一杯索拉米的羹
'cause she's desperate for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

1510
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,060
现在封掉这个莫洛托夫
Boot Molotovgirl now.

1511
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:59,230
我在尝试  但她的账号都是伪造的
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I can, but her account's spoofed.

1512
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,390
这个女人很特别
This woman is exceptional.

1513
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,980
那就在游戏中杀了她
Then kill her in the game.

1514
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,860
“什么？”没错  就是这个意思  杀了她
"What?" Yes, I said that. Kill her.

1515
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:08,360
把全部都用上  好吗  直接升级到五星通缉
Throw everything at them, all right? Five badges, G.

1516
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,030
好的  只有一个问题
Yeah, just one problem.

1517
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,610
我们什么都没有
We don't have anything.

1518
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:12,870
威利斯  你在说什么
Whatchu talking about, Willis?

1519
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,530
我们没有任何防御防御
We don't have any defenses.

1520
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:18,040
也没有警察  军队  什么都没有
We don't have police, military, no nothing.

1521
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,750
我一直都想告诉你
It's what I've been trying to tell you.

1522
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:23,420
就好像所有的NPC都罢工了
It's like every NPC went on strike.

1523
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,550
我要一杯半糖咖啡  双份泡沫燕麦奶
Got a tall, halfcaf, double foam oat milk,

1524
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,130
抹茶拿铁加肉桂
matcha latte with cinnamon!

1525
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,550
那是我的  嘿
That's me. Hey.

1526
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,010
谢谢  不客气
Thank you. You're welcome.

1527
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,300
干杯
Cheers.

1528
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,720
去干掉他们  盖
Go get 'em, Guy!

1529
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,520
这就像是一场数据罢工
It's like a digital walkout.

1530
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,770
不  不是的
No, it's not.

1531
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,860
他们是故意这么做的  这是他们计划的一部分
They're doing this on purpose, it's part of their plan.

1532
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,070
你知道该怎么做吗  我们要在游戏中杀了他们
You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna kill them in the game.

1533
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:50,150
关掉复活功能  进去杀了他们  赶紧
Turn off respawn, kill them dead, now.

1534
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,660
但这意味着任何玩家只要一死就销号了
But that means any players who die will be done for good.

1535
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,120
他们会疯的
They'll freak out.

1536
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,700
我不在乎
I don't care.

1537
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:03,250
先生  说清楚点  你是在告诉我该走了吗
Sir? Sir, just to be clear, are you telling me that it's go time?

1538
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:04,460
你是在找什么笑点吗
Are you looking for some sort of banter thing

1539
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,540
你是认为我们现在是朋友了
'cause you think we're friends now…

1540
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,040
还是觉得我们一起加入了某个帮派吗
and we're in some sort of gang together?

1541
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:09,170
是  是的  我就是想说这个
Yes. Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for.

1542
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,300
对啊  我们是一个团队
Cool, we're a team.

1543
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,380
我们应该来一句
We should come up

1544
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:12,510
来句口号 好吗  好的
with a catchphrase, okay? All right.

1545
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,260
数到三 一 二 三  一 二 三…
On three. One, two, three…  One, two, three…

1546
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,300
滚回去工作
Get back to work!

1547
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,640
快把凯斯给我找来
Someone find me Keys!

1548
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,690
好了  各位  你们听到他说的了  出发吧
All right, people, you heard him. It's go time!

1549
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:32,610
好吧  这可不妙
Okay, that's not good.

1550
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,030
他知道我们要去哪里
He knows where we're going.

1551
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,960
好的  我找到他了  我找到他了  别担心
All right, I got him. I got him. Don't worry.

1552
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,790
想试试四个轮子砸脸吗
Want some four wheels to the face?

1553
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,130
尝尝这个  砰
Take that. Boom!

1554
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,470
兔子要来找你了  我可是顶端捕食者
Rabbit's coming for you. Apex predator.

1555
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,090
Whoa!

1556
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,730
开始吧  你们都在看着吗
Here we go. Y'all watching this?

1557
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,190
我要干掉这个笨蛋了
I'm about to end this fool.

1558
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,730
快点  快点  快点
Come on, come on, come on.

1559
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,740
凯斯  如果你在  请帮帮忙
Keys, if you're there, a little help, please.

1560
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:29,290
该死  那是谁干的  这是谁干的
God! Okay, who did that? Who is doing that?

1561
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:33,130
别惹我  我要来真的了  我压力大死了
Don't play with me! Seriously! I'm under way too much pressure!

1562
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,640
快点
Come on!

1563
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:43,890
快快快
Go, go, go!

1564
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,870
我刚和保安查过了  凯斯还没离开大楼
I just checked with security. Keys hasn't left the building.

1565
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,080
哦  听起来你把该做的都做了
Oh, sounds like you've done everything possible.

1566
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,160
要放弃了吗  你想放弃吗
Time to give up? You wanna give up?

1567
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,250
不  我感觉到你是想让我继续找
No, I'm sensing you want me to keep looking.

1568
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:06,330
那赶紧去  我马上回来
Go. I'll be back.

1569
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,710
我不知道这些笨蛋要跑到哪里去
I have no idea where these fools are running to.

1570
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:13,300
我知道  南岸  刺客海滩
I do. Southern shore. Hitman's Beach.

1571
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,550
太愚蠢了  那外面除了水什么都没有
Well, that's stupid. There's nothing out there but water.

1572
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,300
而且游戏规则会限制不会让你越过海岸线
Game physics won't even let you get past the shoreline.

1573
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:22,050
除非那外面有什么东西
Unless there is something out there.

1574
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,060
安特万  那里有什么东西吗
Antwan, is there something there?

1575
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,480
去他妈的  书呆子们
Screw it. Art nerds.

1576
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,020
启动杜德
Time for Dude.

1577
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,150
我们还在测试
We're still working on him.

1578
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:33,440
我亲自给测试过  他太完美了
I worked on him myself. He's perfect.

1579
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,030
马上启动杜德
Drop in Dude now.

1580
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:37,570
这么做的话  他只有半个大脑
Just do it. He's got, like, half a brain…

1581
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,950
代码还没写完  不过好吧  开始上传吧
he's barely written, but sure, start the upload.

1582
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:49,710
我们现在该怎么办
What are we supposed to do now?

1583
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,670
现在凯斯给我们找到了一座桥
Now Keys finds us a bridge.

1584
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:56,010
要来看看你在背后捅了多少刀子吗  伙计
Come to collect those knives you stabbed in my back, bro?

1585
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,590
你一直在帮米莉·拉斯克
You've been helping Millie Rusk this whole time.

1586
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,090
她在找你的建模
She's looking for your build.

1587
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:02,640
什么建模  安特万
What build, Antwan?

1588
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,810
你不是没用过我们的代码吗
It's not like you used our code anyway, right?

1589
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,180
如果你没有使用我们的代码
And if you didn't use our code…

1590
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,890
那我们的原版怎么会出现在游戏里呢
then how can our original build be in the game, right?

1591
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,480
还是说我遗漏了什么
Or am I missing something?

1592
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,360
你们下去吧
Leave us.

1593
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:21,410
好了  凯斯  让我们好好谈一谈
Okay, Keys, let's have a real talk.

1594
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:24,330
如果我把你那愚蠢的游戏放出来  只会搞砸的
If I'd put out your dumb game, it would have bombed.

1595
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,740
安特万  你预料不了它的成败
Antwan, you don't know it would've failed.

1596
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:26,830
我当然可以预料
Yeah, I do know.

1597
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:30,000
我看了数据  点击  还有群组
I looked at the numbers, the tracking, the focus groups.

1598
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,790
你有没有想过有些东西比数据更重要
Has it ever occurred to you that some things matter more than numbers?

1599
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,380
还有什么比数据更重要呢  钱吗
What matters more than numbers? Money?

1600
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:39,220
哟  快问快答  伙计  钱和数据谁更重要
Yo, news flash, bro, money is still numbers.

1601
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:40,720
没有什么比数据更重要了
Nothing matters more than numbers!

1602
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,260
你应该感谢我
You should be thanking me!

1603
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:43,430
我应该感谢你吗
I should be thanking you?

1604
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,850
那你从我们的作品中获得的利润呢
What about the profits that you got from our work?

1605
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,060
你早就选择了你的立场  小徒弟
You chose your side, little Padawan.

1606
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,770
现在  你应该站在君主这一边
And now, it's time for you to take your place next to the Emperor.

1607
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,850
明白吗
You get me, bro?

1608
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:57,020
是的  我明白了…
Yeah, I get you…  bro.

1609
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,570
我只想给你这个
Which leads me to this.

1610
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:16,090
谢谢  凯斯
Thanks, Keys.

1611
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,380
到底是什么啊
What the hell was that?

1612
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:25,390
嘿  安特万  事情变得越来越复杂了
Hey, Antwan, things are getting hectic.

1613
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,390
哦  我以为能有多聪明呢  凯斯
Oh, I thought you were smarter than this, Keys.

1614
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,640
很明显  你被解雇了
You're obviously fired, you know that.

1615
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:36,860
而你  她还在游戏里干什么  伙计
And you, what is she still doing in the game, man?

1616
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:37,940
把所有人都封掉
Boot everyone.

1617
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,190
等一下  你想让我把所有的玩家都踢出去吗
Hold up. You want me to boot all the players?

1618
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,110
把他们踢出游戏服务器  赶紧的
Boot them out of the game, now!

1619
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,650
封掉所有玩家账号
Cancel every player account!

1620
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,700
那该死的杜德在哪呢
And where the hell is Dude?

1621
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,580
保安  把这个小混混赶出去
Security! Kick this punk out.

1622
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,500
盖
Guy!

1623
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:57,460
米莉  他们要把我踢出服务器了
Millie! They're taking me out.

1624
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:58,540
怎么搞的
What's happening?

1625
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,670
现在全靠你了  大家都看着呢
It's on you now. Everybody's watching.

1626
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,010
你得继续往前走
You gotta keep going.

1627
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,420
等等  等等  等等  我还会再见到你吗
Wait, wait, wait! Will I see you again?

1628
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,260
如果你能过那座桥  我们会再见的
You will if you make it across that bridge.

1629
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,390
向全世界展示我们的建模  那就是证据
Show the whole world our build. That's the proof.

1630
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:09,470
只要你能做到  安特万就完蛋了
You do that, Antwan is done.

1631
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:10,930
我会做到的
I'll make it.

1632
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,060
我会做到的
I'll make it.

1633
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:18,230
见鬼  怎么回事
What the hell?

1634
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:21,940
到底怎么回事
What's going on?

1635
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,190
好吧  在我们被解雇之前  我们最好都记住这一刻
All right, let's all remember this moment, before we were fired.

1636
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:14,910
口号
Catchphrase.

1637
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
口号?
Catchphrase?

1638
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:18,290
什么  我还没来得及想出一个
What? I haven't had time to think one up yet.

1639
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,040
不过把“口号”作为口号是一个相当酷的口号
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase is a pretty cool catchphrase.

1640
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,720
起来  盖  起来啊
Get up, Guy. Get up.

1641
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,190
哦  不
Oh, no, no, no.

1642
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:53,660
盖  我是来救你的
Guy, I came to save you.

1643
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,870
这是谁啊  我不知道
Who is this? I don't know.

1644
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,250
他很壮啊
He's glorious.

1645
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,250
我是说  他就像你一样…
I mean, he's just like you…

1646
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,840
但是比你强多了
but way better.

1647
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:07,880
强多了
Way, way better.

1648
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:09,720
谢谢你  不 我不是在恭维你
Thank you. No, that's not a compliment.

1649
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:11,180
如果我是你  我不会碰他的  巴迪
I wouldn't touch him if I were you, Buddy.

1650
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,640
你这话是什么意思
What do you mean you don't think I should touch him?

1651
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,140
你不介意我碰你吧
You don't mind this, do you?

1652
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,970
因为我也是你的朋友
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

1653
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,270
是的  我想他会… 打你
Yeah, I think he's gonna…  hit you.

1654
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,440
他下手好重啊
He punches so hard.

1655
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,570
但是他的手摸着还挺柔软
But yet his hands are so soft.

1656
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:26,110
要坚强  好的 再见
Be strong. Okay, bye.

1657
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,240
嘿  我对他来说就像一根羽毛
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

1658
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,670
不  不  不  不
No, no, no! No!

1659
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:44,380
起来  盖  起来
Get up, Guy, get up!

1660
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:46,590
游戏时间结束了  口号
Playtime's over. Catchphrase.

1661
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:47,710
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what that means.

1662
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:51,800
拜托  伙计  起来
Come on, man. Get up!

1663
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:52,970
起来啊
Get up.

1664
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,930
我此生最爱三件事
There are three things I love in life.

1665
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:01,560
踹屁股  第二件事待定  而第三件事就是
Kickin' ass, TBD, third thing here.

1666
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,780
哎呀  见鬼
Oof! Oh, shit!

1667
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,200
启动致命一击
Activate death blow.

1668
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,280
再见  盖
Bye, Guy.

1669
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,950
哦  妈的  这可是致命一击
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

1670
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,120
起来啊
Get up!

1671
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:24,670
妈妈  他带着致命一击来了
Mom, he's coming in with a death blow!

1672
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,750
起来  盖
Get up, Guy.

1673
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,890
噢
Oh.

1674
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:39,680
他妈的怎么回事
What the shit?

1675
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:48,480
太帅了
That was dope.

1676
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:06,330
等一下 那是不是…   那是…
Hold on. Is that…  That's a…

1677
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,550
是  那是一把光剑  伙计
Yes! That's a lightsaber, Dude.

1678
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,930
那是一把光剑吗  是的
Is that a lightsaber? It is.

1679
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,430
盖
Guy!

1680
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,810
太好了
Yes!

1681
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,480
对  没错  起来  盖  赶快
Yes! That's right. Get up, Guy. Come on.

1682
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:30,380
这就对了
There you go.

1683
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:33,090
你现在都看到他们了吗  嗯?
Do you see them all now? Yeah?

1684
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:34,550
嗯 嗯  是吗
Uhhuh. Yeah?

1685
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:37,470
是啊  到处都是闪闪发光的东西
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

1686
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,430
好的  去吧  去追吧
Yeah, there you go. Go get it.

1687
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,430
那可是一大堆小点心
Just lots of little snacks.

1688
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,190
好吧  不适合当舞者  不适合
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

1689
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,480
自由奔跑吧
Run free, better me.

1690
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:53,940
我们走吧
Let's go.

1691
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,570
去什么地方
Where are we going?

1692
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:57,440
我们不能让他们过那座桥
We can't let them get across that bridge.

1693
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,240
你想和我一起结束这一切吗
You wanna finish this out with me?

1694
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,700
听着  我甚至不知道发生了什么  但是没毛病  我跟你一起去
Look, I don't even know what's going on, but hell yes, I'm with you.

1695
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:06,200
我们走吧
Let's go!

1696
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:25,470
服务器机房!

1697
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:32,560
安特万  来吧  伙计
Antwan, come on, man.

1698
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:35,070
我们来这里做什么
What are we doing here?

1699
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:37,730
自由之城1的服务器在哪
Where are the servers to Free City 1?

1700
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:40,650
不  安特万  你要干什么
No. Antwan, what the hell are you doing?

1701
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:44,370
如果他们越过地平线去找到了建模  我就什么都没有了
If they get past that horizon to the build, I lose everything!

1702
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,160
等等  所以你真的偷了他们的代码
Wait, so you did steal their code.

1703
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,620
跟你聊天真愉快  天才
Welcome to the conversation, genius.

1704
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:49,910
那些服务器在哪
Now, where are those servers?

1705
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,960
就是这些  不过等一下  我正试着把这件事理清头绪
It's all of these, but hold on. I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

1706
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,290
这些都是吗  这个是吗
All these? This one? Right, this one?

1707
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:54,670
嗯  你是怎么…
Yeah. How did you…

1708
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:02,180
跑
Run.

1709
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:07,970
安特万
Antwan!

1710
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,360
停下
Stop!

1711
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,660
约翰尼警官
Officer Johnny!

1712
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,070
快来  快来
Come on! Come on!

1713
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:30,910
海洋和大桥剩下的服务器是哪一台
Which server has the ocean and the rest of the bridge?

1714
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,040
我不能告诉你
I'm not gonna tell you.

1715
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,170
你会毁了它的
You're just gonna destroy it.

1716
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:34,540
嗯  因为这是我的游戏
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

1717
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,960
不是的  这是凯斯的游戏
Except it's not. It's Keys' game.

1718
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:39,630
不是你做的
You didn't do shit.

1719
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,720
你知道吗  凯斯是我的人
And guess what? Keys is my boy.

1720
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,220
保安
Security!

1721
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:47,760
请带这位前任员工离开这里
Please escort this former employee off the premises.

1722
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:49,930
他会揭开你的丑恶嘴脸
He can call you by your real name.

1723
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,330
盖
Guy!

1724
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,790
巴迪 巴迪  不 不 继续走
Buddy! Buddy! No, no! Keep going!

1725
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,370
你自己快去吧
Go without me!

1726
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,000
我以前畏首畏脑
I've been scared my whole damn life.

1727
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,550
但我现在不再害怕了
But I'm not scared anymore.

1728
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,930
对不起
I'm sorry.

1729
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,930
不必道歉
I'm not.

1730
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:31,770
这是我一生中最开心的一天
It's been the best day of my life.

1731
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,350
你必须去找到那个建模
You get to that build.

1732
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:37,270
你告诉他们我们很重要
You show 'em we matter.

1733
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:47,740
那个保安真是个英雄
That security guard right there was a goddamn hero.

1734
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,800
你做到了
You did it!

1735
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,730
太好了
Yes! Yes!

1736
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:43,230
去死吧  安特万  哇哦
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

1737
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:46,230
安特万  停下
Antwan, stop!

1738
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:48,320
结束了
It's over.

1739
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,200
他做到了
He made it.

1740
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:55,870
把你游戏的原版建模放在那里让所有人都能看到了
Got your game's original build out there for everyone to see.

1741
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,950
你觉得你可能会赢你的官司  是吧
Probably win your lawsuit, huh?

1742
01:37:58,660 --> 01:37:59,660
看起来很有可能
Looks likely.

1743
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:01,040
很好
Cool.

1744
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:05,170
但实际情况是这样的
And here's the thing, bro. Here's the thing.

1745
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:08,130
你所在乎的一切都在我这
Right here, I got everything you care about.

1746
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:12,180
自由之城剩下的那些数据  你的那些NPC朋友
The sliver that's left of Free City, all your little background friends…

1747
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,640
包括你那个数字男友
including your digital boyfriend.

1748
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:16,600
都在最后这台服务器里
Last server.

1749
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:22,640
听着  我只想要留下我建造的世界和里面的NPC
Look, I just want the world that I built and the people in it.

1750
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:24,230
我能得到什么好处
What's in it for Antwan?

1751
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,520
其他的都归你
Everything else.

1752
01:38:25,690 --> 01:38:27,650
什么意思  把我当哑巴吗
Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb.

1753
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:29,900
你有权使用我们的代码  所有利润都归你所有
You have the rights to our code, keep all the profits…

1754
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:31,780
只要把自由之城剩下的留给我就行了
just give me what's left of Free City.

1755
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,110
把我建模的世界还给我
Let me build my own world from there.

1756
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,950
自由之城2呢  自由之城3呢
What about Free City 2? Free City 3?

1757
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,620
以及所有随之而来的衍生作品呢
And all pursuant spinoffs?

1758
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:42,500
都归你了  把斧头放下吧
All yours. Just put down the axe.

1759
01:38:42,910 --> 01:38:45,420
你知道这是最愚蠢的交易吗
You know that this is, like, the dumbest deal

1760
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,960
这是史上最愚蠢的交易吧
in the history of dumb deals, right?

1761
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,210
我是说  你要放弃数百万美元吗
I mean, you're talking about giving up millions of dollars.

1762
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,340
怎么会有人愿意这样做
Why would anyone do that?

1763
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,720
因为凯斯和我创造了更好的东西
'Cause Keys and I made something great.

1764
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:59,470
我不需要金钱或名气来证明
And I don't need money or fame to prove that to myself.

1765
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:02,850
我不想再玩你的游戏了  安特万
I'm done playing your game, Antwan.

1766
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:07,270
该是我发挥我自己的能力的时候了
It's time I played mine.

1767
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:09,730
成交吗
Deal?

1768
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,040
今天的最新消息可不太好
Popping today and not in a good way.

1769
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,710
自由之城2的销售额继续下滑
Sales for Free City 2 continue to slip…

1770
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:28,000
代码中出现大量错误报告  并且在线模式滞后
with numerous reports of bugs in the code and lagging online play.

1771
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:30,550
四面楚歌的索拉米游戏创始人安特万
Embattled Soonami game founder Antwan Hovachelik

1772
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:31,760
发现自己成了众矢之的
finds himself in the crosshairs.

1773
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,260
众矢之的
Crosshairs.

1774
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,050
他成了众矢之的  四面楚歌
He's in the crosshairs and embattled.

1775
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,300
我们这么忙  可没有时间幸灾乐祸
We're too busy to gloat.

1776
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,470
我是受害者  我是受害者
I'm a victim! I'm a victim!

1777
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,470
说到忙  我们刚刚的独立访客数量
Speaking of busy, we just doubled

1778
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,470
已经翻了一倍
the amount of unique visitors we can handle.

1779
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,640
太棒了
It's amazing.

1780
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:45,100
谁能想到这么多人…
Who'd have thought that so many people…

1781
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:48,230
会愿意只想看电子游戏角色而不是朝他们开枪呢
would just wanna watch video game characters instead of shoot at them?

1782
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:49,940
嗯
Hmm…

1783
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:51,780
哦  是的  我们做到了
Oh, yeah, we did.

1784
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:53,610
嗯
Yeah.

1785
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,280
你知道吗  你吹牛的时候很可爱
You know, you're pretty cute when you brag.

1786
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:58,820
安特万滚出去
Antwan out!

1787
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:00,620
同时  游戏《自由生活》
Meanwhile, the game Free Life

1788
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:03,160
正在迅速成为火爆的独立游戏
is quickly becoming the little indie that could.

1789
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,710
玩家蜂拥而至观看这个仅供观测的鱼缸游戏
Players are swarming to this observational, fishbowl game…

1790
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:09,790
他们可以与蓝衫男进行互动
where they interact peacefully with the one and only Blue Shirt Guy…

1791
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,000
现在他不仅仅是后台的数字朋友
and is now no longer in the background, a digital friend.

1792
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,090
呃  嘿  米尔斯
Uh, hey, Mills…

1793
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,720
你想和我一起去喝杯咖啡吗
Do you wanna come grab a coffee with me?

1794
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:21,260
实际上  我要回到游戏中去了
Actually, I'm gonna jump back into the game.

1795
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,020
哦  喝咖啡吗
Oh. Coffee?

1796
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,390
好吧  嗯  听起来不错
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

1797
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,400
我会  呃  我会给你带一杯
I'll just, uh, grab you one.

1798
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:31,020
哦  凯斯  呃
Oh, Keys, uh…

1799
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:32,690
我知道  中杯咖啡  加奶油  加两块糖
I know, medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

1800
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:33,900
嗯
Yeah.

1801
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,110
自由生活

1802
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,110
自由生活

1803
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,110
自由生活

1804
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,110
自由生活

1805
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,110
自由生活

1806
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,410
嗨  兰迪  米尔顿
Hi, Randy. Milton.

1807
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,000
嗯
Hmm.

1808
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,420
我还在想什么时候能再见到你呢
I was wondering when I'd see you again.

1809
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,710
是啊  最近生活很疯狂
Yeah, life has been pretty crazy lately.

1810
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:57,340
你应该看看这里
You should see it in here.

1811
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:59,720
我们说好终生免费的泡沫口香糖冰淇淋
We're talkin' free bubble gum ice cream for life.

1812
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,510
哇
Wow.

1813
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:05,010
嘿  伙计们
Hey, guys.

1814
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,860
听着  盖
Look, Guy…

1815
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:19,240
哇  这比我想象的要难
Wow, this is harder than I thought.

1816
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:21,660
那就让我来帮你说吧
Then let me do it for you.

1817
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:23,990
盖
Guy…

1818
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,960
你太梦幻了
you are dreamy.

1819
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:36,000
你对蓝色衬衫和五个八度音乐巨星的品味…
Your taste in blue shirts and fiveoctave musical superstars…

1820
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:40,380
深深地  深深地吸引着我
it's deeply, deeply attractive to me.

1821
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:42,680
但我不能一直和你在一起
But I can't keep spending all my time with you.

1822
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:48,180
我创造了这个世界  但我不能在里面生活
I created this world, but I can't live my life in it.

1823
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:55,320
这是你想说的吧  有那么难吗
See? Was that so hard?

1824
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,230
那么  你打算怎么做
So, what are you gonna do?

1825
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,860
我想做什么都行  多亏了你
Anything I want. Thanks to you.

1826
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:04,780
我再也不会陷在循环里了
I'm not stuck in a loop anymore.

1827
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,450
你也不用
Neither are you.

1828
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:10,540
我爱你  米莉
I love you, Millie.

1829
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:15,000
也许这就是我的编程风格  但你猜怎么着
Maybe that is my programming talking, but guess what?

1830
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,590
我这个程序是某个人写的
Someone wrote that program.

1831
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,840
我相当于是一封他写给你的情书
I'm just a love letter to you.

1832
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:26,300
而作者就在外面的某个地方
Somewhere out there is the author.

1833
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:48,200
是你让他复活的  是你让他重获新生
You brought him to life. You brought him to life.

1834
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,410
他能有独立意识是因为他遇到了一个人
And he was alive because he met the one person

1835
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,040
一个他一生都在等待的人
he'd been waiting for his whole life.

1836
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:55,420
我必须让它变得真实  所以…
And I had to make it realistic, so…

1837
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:58,500
我是根据…
I based it off of…

1838
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:01,300
你
you.

1839
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:05,390
他的梦中情人…
The woman of his dreams…

1840
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:09,930
也是我的梦中情人
she was the same as mine.

1841
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:13,390
所以她喜欢泡沫口香糖冰淇淋和秋千…
So she liked bubble gum ice cream and swing sets…

1842
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:17,400
她有一个非常可爱但奇怪的特殊习惯…
and she had this very cute but oddly specific habit…

1843
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,110
总是哼唱这首金典的玛利亚·凯莉的歌
of always humming this classic Mariah Carey track.

1844
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:24,200
就像  随时随地都在哼唱
Like, all the time, she would…  repeat.

1845
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:28,450
终于到这一刻了
Finally!

1846
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:36,250
凯斯
Keys!

1847
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:46,130
你在做什么…
What are you…

1848
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:28,510
你还好吗  小盖盖
You okay, little guy Guy?

1849
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:30,720
你看起来  可以用个形容词形容
You seem adjective.

1850
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:33,510
我很好  我很好  顺便说一下  你可以把我放下来
I'm great. I'm great. You could put me down, by the way.

1851
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,350
谢谢  那真是太好了
Thank you. That was nice.

1852
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,980
不  我很好  你也很好  伙计
No, I'm great. You're great, Dude.

1853
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,230
我只是很想念我最好的朋友
I just miss my best friend.

1854
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:46,860
我们过去每天都一起走同样的路
We used to do the same walk together every day.

1855
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:50,320
只不过他穿了件衬衫  而且他会讲一个完整的句子
Except he wore a shirt. And could complete a full sentence.

1856
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:52,200
我可以造一个句子
I can bench press a sentence.

1857
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:55,790
是啊  但这完全不是一回事
Yeah, that's totally not the same thing at all.

1858
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:58,000
笑得再大声一点
Harder laughter!

1859
01:44:59,790 --> 01:45:00,960
盖
Guy?

1860
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:05,510
巴迪  不
Buddy! No!

1861
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:06,840
天哪  盖
Oh, my God! Guy!

1862
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:08,420
巴迪  我以为我已经失去你了
Buddy! I thought I'd lost you!

1863
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:09,510
你没有
You didn't!

1864
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:11,840
前一分钟  我还在一座疯狂的桥上奔跑…
One minute, I'm running on a crazy bridge to nowhere…

1865
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:14,260
以为我甜蜜的世俗生活结束了
thinkin' my sweet mundane life is over.

1866
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:17,020
但下一分钟  我就像在飞一样…
The next minute, I'm like in some type of flyin'…

1867
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:19,190
还有一些像仙尘之类的东西…
and some like fairy dust, pixie dust…

1868
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:23,110
然后我扑通一声掉进了这片天堂
and then I plopped down into this slice of heaven.

1869
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:25,940
伙计  我爱死这里了
Man, I love it here.

1870
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:28,320
事实上  几天前  我骑了一个半人半马
In fact, a couple of days ago, I rode a centaur.

1871
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:29,570
这可能听起来很奇怪
Now, it might sound weird…

1872
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:33,120
我骑着一个半人半马的家伙
I took a piggyback ride on a halfdude and a halfhorse…

1873
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,540
不管是半人半马还是什么  反正就是骑了
whatever a centaur is, I did it.

1874
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,000
我也骑过一个
I rode a dude, too!

1875
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,370
友好的手势
Friendly gesture!

1876
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:39,710
太友好了
So friendly!

1877
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,500
快点过来
Come on, bring it in!

1878
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,000
我们要拥抱吗  我来了哦
Are we gonna hug? I'm coming for you!

1879
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,340
不 不用 我过来了  是的 我要抱抱你
No, you're not. I'm coming for you. Yes, I am!

1880
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:45,670
你过来  我过来咯
You come here! I'm coming to you!

1881
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,460
我过来了  我过来了哦
I'm reeling you in. I'm reeling you in.

1882
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,140
伙计  我想死你了
Buddy, I missed you!

1883
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:54,300
嘿  银行在哪
Hey, so where's the bank?

1884
01:45:55,810 --> 01:45:57,060
没有银行了
There is no bank.

1885
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,470
那我们该怎么做呢
So what do we do?

1886
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:00,890
我们想要做什么都行
Whatever we want.

1887
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:11,570
嘿 伙计们  嘿 盖
Hey, guys. Hey, Guy.
