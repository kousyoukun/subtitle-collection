1
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:54,393
这是自由之城。
This is Free City.

2
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:59,565
看看这个家伙。他是做太阳镜的。
Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people.

3
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:02,902
戴太阳镜的人是英雄。
And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes.

4
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,946
他们有一种无所谓的态度，他们管理着这个镇。
They have a devil-may-care attitude and they run this town.

5
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:17,749
你真性感。
You are so hot.

6
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:18,785
哦,我知道。
Oh, I know.

7
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:24,589
看到了吗?那根本不是他的车。
See? That's not even his car.

8
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,093
或者他的妻子。
Or his wife.

9
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:36,468
对于戴太阳镜的人来说，他们可以做任何他们想做的事。
For the sunglasses people, they get to do anything they want.

10
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,537
他们执行各种各样的任务。
They go on all sorts of missions.

11
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,207
他们有很酷的发型，很酷的衣服。
They got cool hair, cool clothes.

12
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,611
我是说，法律对他们来说并不是真正的法律。它们更像是温和的建议。
I mean, laws aren't really laws to them. They're more like mild suggestions.

13
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:49,648
我觉得他不会还那辆车的。
Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car.

14
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:51,550
或是那位好心的女士。
Or that nice lady.

15
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:09,768
明白我的意思了吧?英雄。
See what I mean? Hero.

16
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:29,155
我叫盖伊，我生活在天堂。
My name is Guy, and I live in paradise.

17
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:35,795
早上好,高迪。
Good morning, Goldie.

18
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:39,966
我这辈子都住在自由城。
I've lived here in Free City my whole life.

19
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:45,238
我有一个最好的朋友，我有一条金鱼，我还在银行工作。
I've got a best friend, I've got a goldfish, and I work at the bank.

20
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,806
一个男人还想要什么?
What more could a guy want?

21
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:49,776
周日应该是温暖和阳光明媚的，只有零星的飞车。
Sunday should be warm and sunny with just a scattering of drive-bys.

22
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:57,016
这是海滩上的好日子，但不是杀手海滩，那里将被一架反叛武装直升机所偷来的地雷和高口径火力扫射。每天早上,
Great day for the beach, but not Hitman's Beach, which will be mined and sprayed with high-caliber fire from a renegade gunship stolen by... And every morning,

23
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:02,388
我用全世界最美味的咖啡开始我的一天。
I start my day with the most delicious coffee in the whole, wide, whole world.

24
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,090
中杯咖啡，加奶油，两块糖。
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

25
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:05,557
你知道它。嗯。
You know it. Mmm.

26
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,527
嗯!
Mmm!

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,430
这是出乎意料的热。
That is unexpectedly hot.

28
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:11,864
哎呀,这很好。
Jeez, that's good.

29
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:15,001
就像我失去了处子之身，只是在我嘴里。
It's like losing my virginity, but in my mouth.

30
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,405
谢谢你用这么多爱做这个。
Thank you for making this with such love.

31
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,539
不客气
You're welcome.

32
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:21,707
官约翰尼!
Officer Johnny!

33
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,942
祝你愉快，盖伊。
Have a good one, Guy.

34
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:26,346
没有美好的一天，要有美好的一天!
Don't have a good day, have a great day!

35
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,147
软糖。
Hold the fudge.

36
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:31,985
你是说没人把那些坏男孩买走吗?就在今天。
You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed up those bad boys? Today is the day.

37
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:34,686
-就像每隔一天。-我会回来拿的。
- Like every other day. - I'll be back for those.

38
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,728
哦!如此接近。
Oh! So close.

39
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,664
嗯!这是有史以来最棒的一杯咖啡。
Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee of all time.

40
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,265
我想为此写首歌。
I wanna write a song about it.

41
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,235
我想用我的身体随着那首歌起舞。
I wanna dance to that song with my body.

42
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,870
我爱我的生活。
I love my life.

43
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,438
找到自己的路，然后一直走下去。
There's something about finding your lane and just staying in it.

44
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,974
这就是为什么人们叫它们舒适区，它们太舒服了。
That's why they call 'em comfort zones, they're so damn comfortable.

45
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,609
哦,乔!
Oh, Joe!

46
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,147
星期一，对吗，乔?
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

47
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,182
-你说对了，盖伊。-是的。
- You said it, Guy. - Yeah.

48
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:09,588
在自由城，我有我需要的一切。
In Free City, I have everything I need.

49
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:13,592
不开心的一天…祝你今天愉快。
Don't have a good day... have a great day.

50
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,128
谢谢你！
Thank you.

51
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,262
当心
Take care.

52
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:19,032
除了一件事。
Except one thing.

53
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,467
似乎快乐。
Seem happy.

54
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:23,735
得了吧，别担心，盖伊。你会找到另一半的。
Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy. You gonna find someone.

55
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,271
没事的，巴德。
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

56
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:28,107
感觉我一直在找她，你知道吗?
Feel like I've been looking for her forever, you know?

57
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,641
也许这不是命中注定的。
Maybe it's not meant to be.

58
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,377
所有人都趴到地上!
Everybody down on the ground!

59
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:41,387
-我认识我要找的女人。-让我猜猜。
- I know the woman I'm looking for. - Oh, let me guess.

60
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,456
-一个有着另类幽默感的女人。-幽默感。
- A woman with an offbeat sense of humor. - Sense of humor.

61
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,824
对自我感觉良好的天后流行音乐的痴迷。
An obsession with feel-good diva pop.

62
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:46,159
流行天后。是的,就是她。
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

63
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:47,994
她在我脑子里租了个地方，不肯搬走。
She's rented space in my brain and she won't move out.

64
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,129
你知道吗?我不想让她这么做。
And you know what? I don't want her to.

65
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:52,799
好吧,你猜怎么着?她既不搬进来，也不搬出去。
Well, guess what? She won't move either in or out.

66
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,434
你知道为什么吗?因为她根本不存在。
You know why? 'Cause she doesn't exist.

67
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,536
-她只是个幻想。这是一个幻想。――这是残酷的。你不但残忍。
- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy. - That's cruel. You're cruel.

68
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:58,237
-你现在太烂了腐烂。-我是认真的
- You're being rotten right now. Rotten. - I'm being real.

69
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,507
没人想当英雄。这一切很快就会结束。
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

70
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:04,310
怎么样?下班后在海滩上喝啤酒?
So how about it? Beers on the beach after work?

71
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,578
我们下班后当然要去海滩上喝啤酒。
Of course we're going for beers on the beach after work.

72
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,081
这让我很高兴。
That makes me so happy.

73
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,182
我也是。
Me too.

74
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:22,626
你得到了什么?
What have you got?

75
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,964
秘密关卡的证明。这就是你想要的，对吧?
Proof of a secret level. That's what you're looking for, right?

76
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,765
你有录像还是截屏?
You got a video or a screen grab?

77
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,632
不。但我知道谁知道。
Nope. But I know who does.

78
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,937
想知道我怎么对付那些浪费我时间的人吗?
Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time?

79
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,605
哦,哇。哦，有人想玩。
Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play.

80
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,575
你是地道的英国人，还是口音过滤器?
Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter?

81
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:37,210
也许我们晚点可以见个面。
'Cause maybe we could meet up later.

82
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:41,180
我并不想去看你妈妈的地下室，谢谢。
I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks.

83
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,448
开玩笑,是吗?
Got jokes, huh?

84
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,784
我有张地图，上面有他藏匿点的位置。
Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house.

85
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:49,721
不知道你要怎么进去，但如果进去，56号剪辑可能会让你感兴趣。
Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you.

86
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,923
现在，我有一个问题。
Now, I got a question.

87
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,459
这个视频有什么特别之处吗?
What's so special about this video clip anyway?

88
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,829
特别的是我杀了问这个问题的人。
What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it.

89
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,831
嗯,我明白了。乐趣。是的,那很有趣。
Mmm, I see. Fun. Yeah, that's fun.

90
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:03,369
妈的，姑娘，你太好强了。
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

91
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,305
但说真的，这是战利品还是仅仅是体验?
But seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience?

92
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,875
这些都是问题。
Those are questions.

93
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:13,279
你看到最后一个劫匪穿的运动鞋了吗?
Did you see the sneakers on that last robber?

94
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,447
两点半吗?
The 2:30?

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,082
不,4点。
No, the 4:00.

96
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:19,152
四分之三高帮，华丽的泡沫鞋底。
The three-quarter high-top, gorgeous foam soles.

97
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:21,354
他踩在我脸上时，我几乎感觉不到。
I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face.

98
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:22,721
――哦,男人。――哇。
- Oh, man. - Wow.

99
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:25,458
大城市的生活。没有比这更好的了。
Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it.

100
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,591
把它给我!
Give it to me!

101
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:27,960
看起来像下雨了。
Looks like rain.

102
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,329
有人看见我的猫了吗?
Has anyone seen my cat?

103
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:38,204
你知道吗，盖伊，人们总是这么说，比如"盖伊比我认识的任何人都更擅长拿鞋砸脸"
You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like, "Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."

104
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:40,940
我是说，当你把它放在那里的时候，你表现得好像不是一只鞋在你脸上。
I mean, when you put it on there, you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

105
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:53,052
没有美好的一天，要有美好的一天。
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

106
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,220
喜欢这首歌。
Love that song.

107
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,091
这是新的。
That's a new one.

108
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:13,206
嘿!
Hey!

109
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:16,175
这是她的。
That's her.

110
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:17,742
她是谁?
Her who?

111
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,679
那是我的梦中情人，巴迪。
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

112
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:21,279
她的存在。
She exists.

113
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:24,784
-我去和她谈谈-等等，等等，等等。
- I'm gonna go talk to her. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

114
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:27,153
等待的人。她戴着墨镜。
Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.

115
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,222
所以呢?
So?

116
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:30,423
到了以后的意思是“所以?”
Whatcha mean "so?"

117
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,290
戴墨镜的人不跟我们这样的人说话。
So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us.

118
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,594
-你知道的!-我得试试。
- You know that! - I gotta try.

119
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:37,196
看,Guy!Guy!
Look, Guy! Guy!

120
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,066
Guy!在海滩上喝啤酒怎么样?
Guy! What about beers on the beach?

121
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,402
打扰一下!
Excuse me!

122
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:48,341
嘿!
Hey!

123
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:50,942
嘿!
Hey!

124
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,856
自由之城2即将到来!
Coming soon... Free City 2!

125
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,627
更大的!有害健康!瑞蓝德尔!
Bigger! Badder! Radder!

126
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,462
自由之城2:大屠杀。
Free City 2: Carnage.

127
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,364
今天预订并获得额外的Mayhem包。
Pre-order today and get the bonus Mayhem Pack.

128
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:13,199
你做了什么?
You done?

129
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:15,701
对不起。你关闭吗?
Sorry. Are you closing?

130
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,869
是的。
Yes.

131
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:21,140
我们通常不把椅子放在桌子上，一个小咖啡，超过四个小时的女孩。
We usually don't put the chairs on the tables, one-small-coffee- over-four-hours girl.

132
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:24,844
你真的很喜欢那个游戏，是吧?我12岁的侄子上瘾了。
You really like that game, huh? My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.

133
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:26,712
似乎每个人都对它着迷。
Seems like everyone's obsessed with it.

134
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,682
哦,自由城?啊。不。
Oh, Free City? Ah. No.

135
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:33,986
我要起诉出版商我需要的证据就在游戏里。
I, uh, have a lawsuit against the publisher and the evidence that I need is in the game.

136
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,491
-然后我有了我的密码…-哦…我真希望我们没有关门，这样我就能听到更多的消息了。
- So then I had my codes... - Oh... I wish we weren't closing so I could hear more about this.

137
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,236
早上好,高迪。
Good morning, Goldie.

138
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,044
中杯咖啡，加奶油，两块糖。
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

139
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:01,147
中杯咖啡，加奶油，两块糖。
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

140
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:07,620
事实上，我今天想喝杯卡布奇诺。
Actually, I think I'd like to try a cappuccino today.

141
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:11,157
哦。“卡布奇诺”。我喜欢这么说。
Ooh. "Cappuccino." I enjoy saying that.

142
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,759
就像字母组成的瀑布。
It's like a waterfall made of letters.

143
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:14,960
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

144
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,196
我想试试卡布奇诺。
I'd like to try a cappuccino.

145
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:20,266
――请。-但你要一杯中杯咖啡，加奶油和两块糖。
- Please. - But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

146
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,401
这就是你得到的结果。这是每个人都会得到的。
That's what you get. That's what everyone gets.

147
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,903
每一天。总是这样。
Every day. Always.

148
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,138
――好吧,我…-有人要中弹了。
- Well, I... - Somebody's about to get shot.

149
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,474
官约翰尼。
Officer Johnny.

150
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:31,877
我只是想今天尝试点不一样的东西?
I just thought I'd try something different today, you know?

151
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,513
无论什么。对吧?是吗?
Whatever. Right? Yeah?

152
00:09:38,184 --> 00:09:39,185
嗨。
Hi.

153
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,556
哈!我只是让你保持警觉。
Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.

154
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,859
请给我咖啡、奶油、两块糖。
Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.

155
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:48,795
我在开玩笑。
I'm joking.

156
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,797
让你保持警觉我是在开玩笑。
Just keeping you on your toes. I was kidding.

157
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,331
他只是在开玩笑!
He was just kidding!

158
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:55,534
你以为我会剥夺你的重拳艺术吗?
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself of your baristic artistry?

159
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:56,769
不可能，不可能。
No way, no how.

160
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:59,405
嗯。这是热的。
Mmm. That's hot.

161
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:08,647
就像耶稣给我洗了舌头但就在他结束之前，他终于告诉我爸爸，“他够好了。”
It's like Jesus washed my tongue... but right before he finished, he finally told my dad, "He's good enough."

162
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,551
非常感谢。约翰尼警官!
Thank you so much. Officer Johnny!

163
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:13,586
祝你愉快，盖伊。
Have a good one, Guy.

164
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,258
卡布奇诺。
Cappuccino.

165
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:26,031
不愉快的一天... ...我想，祝你今天过得愉快。
Don't have a good day... ... have a great day, I guess.

166
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:30,169
好吧。祝你好运。
Okay. Good day to you.

167
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:33,139
所有人都趴到地上!
Everybody down on the ground!

168
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:36,008
没人想当英雄。这一切很快就会结束。
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

169
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,002
这是那个女孩。
That's the girl.

170
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,403
我们已经谈过了。
We've been over this.

171
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,071
你昨天想跟她谈谈，但没成功。
You tried to talk to her yesterday, it didn't work.

172
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:07,740
这永远不会奏效。
It will never work.

173
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:09,041
她戴着墨镜。
She's wearing sunglasses.

174
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,509
我们不招惹戴太阳镜的人。
We don't mess with the sunglasses people.

175
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,578
也许我该买一副自己的太阳镜。
Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own.

176
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:13,914
什么?你在说什么?你不能这么做。
What? What are you talking about? You can't do that.

177
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,514
哦,我的上帝。我在做什么?
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

178
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:17,483
嗨。
Hi.

179
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:18,651
你想说什么?
What'd you say?

180
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,287
嗨。
Hi.

181
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,790
我需要你的太阳镜。
I'm gonna need your sunglasses.

182
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:24,925
哦。噢。
Ooh. Ow.

183
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:27,426
…我需要一下你的太阳镜。
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec.

184
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,929
你知道你在干什么吗?
What the hell do you think you're doing?

185
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,095
回你那边去，伙计。
Go back to your side, man.

186
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:34,200
他只是个NPC。垃圾的母亲……好吧，就借一下，好吗?
He's just an NPC. Waste that mother... Okay, just need to borrow them for a sec, okay?

187
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,769
――后退!我说,不!-很快就好。真正的快。
- Back off! I said, don't! - Just real quick. Real quick.

188
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:39,538
停!
Stop!

189
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,842
你摔坏了还是怎么了?
You broken or somethin'?

190
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:42,943
我是强盗!
I'm the robber!

191
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,743
你是那个躺下来拿走它的人!
You're the guy who lies down and takes it!

192
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:45,946
求你了，趴下!
Please, just stay down!

193
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,949
我说了，趴下!
I said, stay down!

194
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,316
盖伊，你不能这么做。
Guy, you don't do this, man.

195
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:52,718
这不是你。
This isn't you.

196
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:54,153
你不能这么做。
You don't do this.

197
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,722
也许我做的。
Maybe I do.

198
00:11:56,755 --> 00:12:00,559
这个愚蠢的任务有什么问题?
What is wrong with this... stupid mission?

199
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:01,894
我跟你说了让他去死。
I told you to smoke his ass.

200
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:03,028
放开!
Let go!

201
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:04,865
我马上还给你。
I'll give them right back.

202
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:06,800
我说…
I said...

203
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,571
Guy?
Guy?

204
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:18,911
他只是休息。
He's just resting.

205
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,012
在碎片!
In pieces!

206
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:21,714
那个人死了!
That man is dead!

207
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,616
他太困了。
He's so sleepy.

208
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:31,757
我会把你的枪放在这里等你醒来。
I'm just gonna put your gun down... right here... for when you wake.

209
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,059
――好吗?――Guy。
- Okay? - Guy.

210
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:37,296
Guy!你会在哪里?
Guy! Where you goin'?

211
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,562
原谅我。
Excuse me.

212
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,565
看到了吗?
Do you see this?

213
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:15,401
周五前把季度报告放在我桌上。
Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

214
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:37,489
哇!
Whoo!

215
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:39,758
哦!
Oh!

216
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,160
头晕了!
Giddy up!

217
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,295
我感觉焕然一新。
I feel brand new.

218
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:55,875
失败者。
Loser.

219
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,685
发生了什么?
What is happening?

220
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:11,256
这么多钱。
So much money.

221
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,779
嘿，慕斯，看看这个。
Hey, Mouser, check this out.

222
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,047
怎么了,钥匙吗?
What's up, Keys?

223
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,314
我在看什么?
What am I looking at?

224
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:39,251
好吧，这个用户，他的眼镜被偷了，然后被杀了。
Okay, so this user, he gets his glasses stolen and then killed.

225
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,253
这家伙被一个不可玩的角色干掉了。
The guy was smoked by a non-playable character.

226
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,188
一个人大吗?这是不可能的。
An NPC? That's impossible.

227
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:44,657
是的,没错。
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,926
没有人可以在自己的角色上装备NPC皮肤。
Nobody can equip an NPC skin on their avatar.

229
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,097
是啊，所以你只要踢走这个垃圾菜鸟，终身禁止他，你就完了。
Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass noob and ban him for life, you're done.

230
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:54,968
我试过，但…我追踪不到他。
I tried that, but I... I can't trace him.

231
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:58,170
不管是谁，他们都很厉害。
Whoever it is, they're good.

232
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:01,540
嗯。你得把工作做得更好，伙计。
Hmm. You gotta be better at your job, buddy.

233
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,110
我很好。
I'm pretty good.

234
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,310
我们里面见。
I'll see you on the inside.

235
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:06,445
选择你的皮肤。
Select your skin.

236
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,480
凯斯，你要用什么皮肤?
Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with?

237
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:11,717
推。脱衣舞女警察，大枪，大胡子。
The ushe. Dirty stripper cop, big guns, bigger mustache.

238
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,485
嗯。小松鼠。我喜欢它。
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it.

239
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,587
我都不敢问了，你到底想说什么?
Almost scared to ask, but what are you going with?

240
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,324
全身小胡子，粉红色的。你应该非常害怕。
Uh, full body mustache, hot pink. You should be very afraid.

241
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:20,893
我吓坏了。
I'm terrified.

242
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,394
让我们这样做。
Let's do this.

243
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,264
说真的,男人。
Seriously, man.

244
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:02,501
说实话，我觉得兔子装有点过了。
I'm just being honest, I think the bunny suit is just a little much.

245
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,004
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

246
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:07,974
正确的。
Right.

247
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,375
兔子。好吧?我的错。
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

248
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:13,913
嘿,四十岁的老处男!在这里!
Hey, 40-year-old virgin! Get over here!

249
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:14,981
我们走吧!
Let's go!

250
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,248
啊哈。队长卡其裤。
Uh-huh. Captain Khakis.

251
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,283
――来到这里。来吧,芽。-走，我们走。
- Come here. Come on, bud. - Go, let's go.

252
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,086
――接近。-他来了。
- Closer. - There he is.

253
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,754
蓝色衬衫的家伙。
Blue shirt guy.

254
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:23,622
蓝色的衬衫吗?
Blue shirt?

255
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,324
是的。
Yes.

256
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,392
你好,警官。
Hello, Officer.

257
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:29,394
兔子。
Rabbit.

258
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:30,729
漂亮的皮肤。
Nice skin.

259
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:33,166
谢谢你！这是甜的。
Thank you. That's sweet.

260
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,500
你怎么拿到的?
How'd you get it?

261
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:38,071
嗯，我想主要是遗传。我很幸运。
Well, uh, mostly genetics, I think. I'm pretty lucky.

262
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:39,839
我的皮肤天生水灵灵的。
I have naturally dewy skin.

263
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,207
听好了,露得清。
Listen up, Neutrogena.

264
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,342
你知道你不能穿成这样到处走。规则很清楚。
You know you can't go around looking like that. The rules are clear.

265
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,609
和另一件事。
And another thing.

266
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:46,146
你不能黑掉NPC角色。――不,先生!
- You can't hack the NPC avatars. - No, sir!

267
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,379
-这搞砸了任务…-搞砸了!
- It screws up the mission load... - Screws it up!

268
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:48,613
…这让游戏看起来很糟糕。
...and it makes the game look bad.

269
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,083
――可怕的!-是的。
- Horrible! - Yeah.

270
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,185
我大概得到了5%
I got, like, 5% of that.

271
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:53,787
失去的皮肤!
Lose the skin!

272
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,887
我…失去了什么?
I... Lose?

273
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,923
我要怎么摆脱我的皮肤?
How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?

274
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:57,824
把它拿下来，伙计。
Take it off, man.

275
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,391
把它拿下来。你在干什么?
Just take it off. What are you doing?

276
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:00,592
――什么?――认真。
- What? - Seriously.

277
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,162
-整件事。脸，衣服。――如何?
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit. - How?

278
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,395
――一切。抛弃它。-脱下来。
- Everything. Ditch it. - Take it off.

279
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,730
如果你不，我们就杀了你。
If you don't, we're gonna kill you.

280
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,632
――为什么?-我们会继续杀你。
- Why? - And we're gonna keep killing you.

281
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:07,599
还是为什么?
Still why?

282
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,736
直到我们查出你的身份...然后我们会终身禁止你入内。
Until we do find out who you are... and then we're gonna ban you for life.

283
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:14,107
好吧。不,不。好吧，我同意。
Okay. No, no. Okay, I want to comply.

284
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,542
我只是觉得这些威胁的顺序很混乱。
I just find the order of those threats very confusing.

285
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:18,278
-有人要中弹了。-点燃他
- Somebody's about to get shot. - Light him up

286
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,896
不。
No.

287
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,373
来吧，蓝衬衫。
Come on, Blue Shirt.

288
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:11,064
哦!没想到会这样。你看到了吗?
Oh! Didn't see that one coming. Did you see that one coming?

289
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:12,298
吓了我一跳。
Scared me a little bit.

290
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,800
我们来找你了，蓝衬衫!
We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!

291
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,301
我来接你。
Coming to get ya.

292
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,036
我们会来接你的。
We're coming to get ya.

293
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,605
等等!等等!
Wait! Wait!

294
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,041
我可以解释一切。
I can explain everything.

295
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:25,878
我找到了这副眼镜，现在我能看见东西了。
I found these glasses and then I can see things now.

296
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:29,048
的东西……哇,哇。不存在的东西。
Things that... Whoa, whoa. Things that aren't there.

297
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,582
除了他们在那里。
Except they are there.

298
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:34,720
我知道这听起来很疯狂，但这是真的!
I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!

299
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:37,991
你可以跑，蓝衫军，但你躲不了。
You can run, Blue Shirt, but you cannot hide.

300
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,659
来吧，蓝衬衫。你逃不过那只兔子。
Come on, Blue Shirt. You can't escape the rabbit.

301
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,862
我们顶端食肉动物。
We're apex predators.

302
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:46,732
我们所做的就是撕咬，打架，割喉。
All we do is bone and brawl and slit throats.

303
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,501
太高了!太高了!
Too high! Too high!

304
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,014
你想玩吗，蓝衫军?看这个。
Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt? Watch this.

305
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:05,084
我厌倦了这些游戏，凯斯。是时候让这娘娘腔见鬼去了。
I tire of these games, Keys. It's time I went god-mode on this beyotch.

306
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:06,286
好吧,把它。
Okay, bring it.

307
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,121
哦,这是共舞。快，快，快，快。
Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.

308
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,038
我非常非常擅长这个。
I'm so, so good at this.

309
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:35,114
时间到了，银行出纳!
Time's up, bank teller!

310
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:58,171
不!
Nope!

311
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:23,830
我不能死!
I can't die!

312
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:25,764
我不会死的!
I'm never gonna die!

313
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,000
哇!
Whoo!

314
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,103
这就是蓝衫男令人心碎的故事。
And that was the heartbreaking story of Blue Shirt Guy.

315
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,304
最后。
The end.

316
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:33,473
-没道理啊。――什么?
- Doesn't make sense. - What?

317
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,041
我刚查了服务器的数据。
I just checked the server stats.

318
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:37,275
我们杀死了Blue Shirt，在线玩家的数量并没有改变。
We killed Blue Shirt and the number of players online didn't change.

319
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,378
这只是个小故障，伙计。
It's just a glitch, man.

320
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,711
-没什么大不了的。-我知道，我知道
- It's not a big deal. - I know, I know.

321
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:41,414
这似乎是件新鲜事，你知道吗?
It just seems like that's something new, you know?

322
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,647
凯斯，我知道你在想什么?你不应该和安特万说话。
Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay? You should not talk to Antwan.

323
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:45,451
我只是觉得开诚布公很重要，好吗?
I just think it's important to be transparent, okay?

324
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:46,918
嗯。不。
Uh-uh. No.

325
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:52,290
安特万正在深入续集的发行中。他要么不在乎要么就会生气，然后责怪我们。
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch. He's either not gonna care or he's gonna get pissed and then he's gonna blame us.

326
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,294
我不知道你还有什么没弄明白的。
So, I don't know what you haven't figured out about the whole situation.

327
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:59,832
另外，你是不是麻省理工学院的天才，独立游戏设计师?
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius, indie game designer?

328
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,368
你在这里处理投诉做什么?
What are you doing down here dealing with complaints?

329
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:08,775
慕斯，这是一个漫长而可悲的故事，涉及到失败的梦想、绝望和堆积如山的大学债务。
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic story involving failed dreams, desperation, and a mountain of college debt.

330
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:11,044
你不会想听的。
You do not wanna hear about that.

331
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:12,378
你是绝对正确的。
You're absolutely right.

332
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:16,516
那个故事听起来可怕又无聊而且充满了白人特权。
That story sounds horrible and boring and full of white privilege.

333
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:18,550
不要和安特万说话。
Don't talk to Antwan.

334
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,458
我们做梦也没想到会发生这种事。
We never dreamt this would've happened.

335
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:28,161
我的意思是，《生活》本质上就是一场鱼缸游戏。
I mean, Life Itself, it's essentially a fishbowl game.

336
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:32,031
人们不是在玩它，而是在看着它成长。
People aren't playing it, they're watching it grow.

337
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:37,769
这是一个严格的观察体验，电脑生成的角色互动和发展。
It's a strictly observational experience where computer generated characters interact and evolve.

338
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:39,539
我还以为我们能把它送出去就很幸运了。
I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.

339
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:44,444
这就是凯斯的魅力所在，他对自己的天赋一无所知。
That's what's so charming about Keys, he's clueless about his own genius.

340
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,012
不，米莉才是天才。
Uh, no, Millie is the genius.

341
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:49,782
她从头开始建造了人工智能引擎。
Uh, she built the AI engine from the ground up.

342
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:53,386
说点私人的，你早上起床的动力是什么?
So, to get a little personal, what's the thing that gets you up in the morning?

343
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,055
中杯咖啡，加奶油，两块糖。
Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

344
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:58,524
另一件事是什么?
What's the other thing?

345
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:00,960
哦,是的。对认可的渴望。
Oh, yeah. An insatiable thirst for validation.

346
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,661
-她没开玩笑――我不是。
- She's not kidding. - I'm not.

347
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:03,930
你呢?
How about you?

348
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:05,531
――代码。――代码?
- Code. - Code?

349
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:06,598
――代码。――代码,是的。
- Code. - Code, yeah.

350
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,201
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

351
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,136
因为这不仅仅是0和1，这是隐藏的信息。
'Cause it's not just zeros and ones, it's hidden messages.

352
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:12,538
实际上，我喜欢把自己看作一个作者，而不是一个代码编写者。
I like to think of myself, actually, as not a code writer, but an author.

353
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:17,176
我只用0和1代替文字，因为文字会让你失望。
I just use zeros and ones instead of words 'cause words will let you down.

354
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,781
但是0和1，从来没有。0和1就像屎一样酷。
But zeros and ones, never. Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

355
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:23,615
-他没开玩笑――我不是。
- He's not kidding. - I'm not.

356
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:25,218
现在，我不得不问。
Now, I've gotta ask.

357
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,520
你们俩之间有很多化学反应。
There is a lot of chemistry between the two of you.

358
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:30,456
-这已经演变成…――没有。
- Has this evolved into more than... - No.

359
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,126
――没有。不。完全是柏拉图式的。-不不不。我们的朋友。
- No way. No. It's strictly platonic. - No, no, no. We're friends.

360
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,693
-我们就像最好的朋友――友谊。
- We're like best friends. - Friendship.

361
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:37,797
现在你的游戏将由世界上最大的发行商之一Soonami发行。
And now your game is gonna be released by Soonami, one of the biggest publishers in the world.

362
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,799
-事实上，这太疯狂了。-是的。
- It's crazy, actually. - It is, yeah.

363
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:42,934
不过，这看起来确实有点不太可能。
It does seem a little bit like an unlikely pairing, though.

364
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:45,037
是啊，我也没完全明白。
Yeah, I didn't totally get it either.

365
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:49,242
但米莉对这些事很有直觉……安特万是个天才。
But Millie's got a real instinct for these things... Antwan is a genius.

366
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:52,711
他傲慢又令人讨厌，但他真的很擅长他的工作。
He's brash and obnoxious, but he's really good at what he does.

367
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,981
这是一个让更多观众看到我们作品的机会。
It's a chance for our work to be seen by a wider audience.

368
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:57,083
-天啊，那两个人年轻又蠢。――呀。
- God, those two were young and dumb. - Jeez.

369
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:59,118
所以我们现在要破门而入?
So we're breaking and entering now?

370
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:02,855
为一个冰冻的黑洞工作感觉如何?
How does it feel working for a galactic black hole of frozen shit?

371
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,956
你必须离开。我不能跟你说话。
You have to leave. I can't talk to you.

372
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:06,758
羞愧会产生这样的效果。
Aw, shame will have that effect.

373
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,361
不,米莉。我是说我不能跟你说话。
No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.

374
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:14,666
我都看不到你了。我真的是在关注背景物体因为看着你的嘴唇动违反了我的保密协议，这可能会让我被解雇。
I can't even see you. I'm literally focusing on background objects because looking at your lips move violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

375
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,470
被安特万解雇了，那个偷了我们成果的家伙?
Aw, fired by Antwan, the guy who stole our work?

376
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:19,172
不，他买了，然后放了起来。
No, he bought it and then he shelved it.

377
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:22,508
好吧?你活在过去。你卡住了。你得向前看。
All right? You're living in the past. You are stuck. You gotta move on.

378
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,708
我怎样才能继续前行?
How can I move on?

379
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:25,144
你怎么可以呢?
How can you?

380
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:28,147
安特万偷走了我们的AI引擎，用在他那愚蠢的射击游戏中。
Antwan swiped our AI engine to use in his dumb shooter.

381
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,851
他,米莉吗?因为说实话，我不太确定。
Did he, Millie? Because honestly, I'm not so sure.

382
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:37,957
我们的游戏复杂、漂亮、有趣，《Free City》可能很受欢迎，但它太愚蠢了，让我想哭。
Our game was complex and beautiful and interesting and Free City, it may be popular, but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

383
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,959
那就别再为他辩护了，帮我揍他一顿。
Then stop defending him and help me beat his ass.

384
00:23:39,992 --> 00:23:42,694
米莉,我…-拜托，凯斯，他偷了我们的东西。
- Millie, I'm... - Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

385
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:46,399
现在他撒谎了这样他就不用给我们应得的荣誉和版税了。
And now he's lying about it so he doesn't have to give us the credit and the royalties that we deserve.

386
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,002
米莉……我发现了一条线索。在一个玩家的藏匿处有个剪辑。
Millie... I found a clue. It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

387
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:53,639
我只需要你帮我进去。
All I need from you is to get me in there.

388
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,075
米莉，我很在乎你…
Millie, I care about you...

389
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,181
但你得离开。
but you need to leave.

390
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,458
今天会不一样的，歌迪。
Today is gonna be different, Goldie.

391
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:14,987
我们在看什么?
What are we lookin' at?

392
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:17,757
你是谁?
Who are you?

393
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,458
好吧,好吧。好吧。
Okay, okay. Okay.

394
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:22,061
那天我们碰到了，你在哼那首很棒的歌。
We ran into each other the other day, you were humming that great song.

395
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,029
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

396
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:25,798
我以为你是NPC。你怎么找到我的?
I thought you were an NPC. How did you find me?

397
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:30,369
我在外面的谋杀列车旁等着，然后跟踪了你。
I waited outside by the murder train, then I followed you.

398
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,404
狗屎!
Shit!

399
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,187
我要和你一起去吗?
Should I come with you?

400
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:50,589
是的。
Yes.

401
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:54,260
我的天，发生什么事了?
Holy hell, what just happened?

402
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:57,029
刚才发生的事是你差点毁了我的任务。
What just happened is you almost blew my mission.

403
00:25:57,063 --> 00:26:00,333
不，我是说，我们是怎么走到这一步的?
No, I mean, how did we get from there to wherever this is?

404
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:01,933
你是说传送门的枪?
You mean the portal gun?

405
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,736
门户枪?这听起来昂贵。
Portal gun? That sounds expensive.

406
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,971
哇，你真是个特别的菜鸟。
Wow, you are a special kind of noob.

407
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:07,340
谢谢你！你也一样。
Thank you. You too.

408
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:08,474
转身。
Turn around.

409
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:10,509
好吧。
Okay.

410
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,980
哦。
Oh.

411
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:20,585
这是北极吗?
Is this the North Pole?

412
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,054
听着,伙计。
Listen, dude.

413
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,824
――人。――人。无论什么。
- Guy. - Guy. Whatever.

414
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:28,394
NPC装备上的道具，但我正忙着想办法偷东西。
Props on the NPC outfit, but I'm busy trying to figure out how to steal something.

415
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:30,329
也许我能帮你。
Maybe I could help you.

416
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:31,497
我独自工作。
I work alone.

417
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,932
你有漂亮的手榴弹。
You have beautiful grenades.

418
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:38,037
此外，如果你想有机会在这里产生影响，你需要有更高的水平。
Besides, if you want to have any chance of making an impact here, you need to have a higher level than that.

419
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,905
――这是困难的。不。――没有。
- That's tough. No. - No.

420
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:41,540
更高级别?
Higher level?

421
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:42,942
上帝啊，菜鸟。
Good Lord, rook.

422
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:45,644
看到了吗?
See?

423
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:47,646
――哦。――这是我的。
- Oh. - That's mine.

424
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,415
这是你的。
And that's yours.

425
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:53,787
哦……是最好的还是最坏的?
Oh... What, is one the best or the worst?

426
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,321
没有比这更低的了。
There is literally nothing lower.

427
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:57,456
那我怎么才能达到更高的境界呢?
Well, how do I get to a higher level?

428
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,425
――真的吗?――真的。
- Really? - Really.

429
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:03,629
-你知道的，拿东西。-是的。
- You know, get stuff. - Yeah.

430
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:05,664
-你在开玩笑吗?――好的。
- Are you kidding me right now? - Okay.

431
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:06,932
――经验,枪……-是的。
- Experience, guns... - Yeah.

432
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,000
-把它放下。――嗯。
- Put that down. - Uh-huh.

433
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,469
钱。这是自由之城。
Money. This is Free City.

434
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:15,007
你可以抢劫商店，劫车，打行人的脸。你会想出办法的。
You could rob a store, carjack someone, punch a pedestrian in the face. You'll figure it out.

435
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,576
我绝不会伤害无辜的人。
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

436
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:23,916
嗯。我得承认这让人耳目一新。
Hmm. I've got to admit that is kind of refreshing.

437
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:28,120
有时我忘了不是你在这里遇到的每个人都是反社会的大孩子。
Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet on here is a sociopathic man-child.

438
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:30,356
谢谢你！
Thank you.

439
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:33,058
等待。但世界并没有那么糟糕，不是吗?
Wait. But the world isn't that bad though, is it?

440
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:36,362
哦!这是相当黯淡。
Oh! It's pretty bleak.

441
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:39,098
如果你见过那个对这个世界负责的混蛋，你会同意的。
If you ever met the dick responsible for this world, you'd agree.

442
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:42,968
我们是在说上帝吗?你见过上帝吗?
Are we talking about God? You've met God?

443
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:45,171
他是个混蛋?
And he's a dick?

444
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:48,040
他叫安特万，没错，他绝对是个巨魔。
His name's Antwan, and yes, he's an absolute troll.

445
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:49,776
巨魔存在吗?
Trolls exist?

446
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:56,382
听着，我不知道是否有人会这么做，但你可以通过做个好人来积累经验。
Look, I don't know if anybody does it, but you could rack experience points up by being a good guy.

447
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:58,451
-像个英雄。――哦。容易,老虎。
- Like a hero. - Ooh. Easy, tiger.

448
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:00,753
如果你不想开枪，你可以偷他们的枪。
If you don't wanna shoot people, you could steal their guns.

449
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:02,388
这些东西让你的水平提高了。
All that shit makes your level go up.

450
00:28:02,421 --> 00:28:03,824
去做个好人吧。
Go be the good guy.

451
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:05,124
好吧。不，我要做个好人。
Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy.

452
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,459
噢!哦。
Ooh! Ooh.

453
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,829
好吧，好好享受你一辈子的童贞吧。
Okay, well, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity.

454
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,162
你去。
Off you go.

455
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,198
好吧。等等!我怎么知道我已经升级了?
Okay. Wait! How will I know that I've leveled up enough?

456
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:15,067
-超过100个我们再谈――哇。
- Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk. - Whoa.

457
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,102
现在,再见。-那可不止一个。
- Bye now. - That's so much more than one.

458
00:28:17,136 --> 00:28:18,471
-又多了99个…现在,再见。
- It's like 99 more... - Bye now.

459
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:19,505
好吧。
Okay.

460
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,444
嗨。
Hi.

461
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,606
谢谢你,小伙子。
Thanks, Guy.

462
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,061
早上好,高迪。
Good morning, Goldie.

463
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:51,430
早上好,高迪。
Good morning, Goldie.

464
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:53,299
早上好，歌迪。
Good fucking morning, Goldie.

465
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:56,970
我给你三个字。蓝色衬衫Guy。
I have three words for you. Blue Shirt Guy.

466
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:01,841
BSG通过扮演英雄以创纪录的速度升级。
BSG is leveling up and at a record pace by playing the hero.

467
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:05,544
全世界的人都在问:“这家伙到底是谁?”
It's got people all over the world asking, "Just who is this guy?"

468
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:09,315
我不知道这家伙是谁，但他比所有的球员都厉害。
I don't know who this guy is, but he's out-skilling all these players.

469
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:13,118
他在这里，干掉了《无敌世界》的102级的Beefoven。
And here he is, taking out Beefoven, a level 102 from Clan Ragnarok.

470
00:30:13,152 --> 00:30:15,154
这是废话。这家伙是谁?
This is bullshit. Who is this guy?

471
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,355
我不知道，但他很厉害。
I don't know, but he's good.

472
00:30:16,388 --> 00:30:22,895
是的,他很好。他看起来像个NPC，但他四处奔跑，以一个非常好的角色快速升级。
Yeah, he's good. He looks like an NPC but he's running around, leveling up crazy fast by being the freaking good guy.

473
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:28,835
"电子游戏《自由之城》中的这个多姿多彩的角色"因为是个好人而备受关注"
"This colorful character in the video game Free City "has been turning heads by being the good guy."

474
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,569
――笛手。-谁是蓝衫男?
- Piper. - Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

475
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:31,972
你是绝对正确的。
You're absolutely right.

476
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:37,043
蓝色衬衫的家伙。他或她到底是谁?
Blue Shirt Guy. Who is he or she indeed?

477
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:53,258
Whoo-hoo !
Whoo-hoo!

478
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:05,657
有一种风靡全球的时尚俘获了孩子们的心――蓝衫男!
There's a worldwide craze that has captured kids' hearts-- Blue Shirt Guy!

479
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,367
你好,Hinata。
Hello, Hinata.

480
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,536
你的衣服真棒。
You have a great outfit.

481
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,539
不要有美好的一天，要有美好的一天!
Don't have a good day, Have a GREAT day!

482
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,458
太棒了! !
Crazy awesome!!!

483
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:59,993
好,好,好。看看今天谁来上班了?
Well, well, well. Look who decided to come to work today, huh?

484
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:04,763
听着，你去哪儿了?我担心死你了……这件衬衫是什么?
Look, where have you been? I've been worried sick about you... What is this shirt?

485
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,298
你的项圈在哪里?其余的按钮呢?
Where's your collar at? Where's the rest of the buttons?

486
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,802
而且它没有塞进去。你看起来邋遢。
And it's not tucked in. You look sloppy.

487
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:11,670
事实上，你看起来糟透了。你也练肌肉了吗?
Matter of fact, you look horrible. Did you pick up some muscles, too?

488
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,173
还是有人在外面给你打气?
Or is somebody outside pumping you up?

489
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:16,208
很抱歉我没陪你，巴德。
I'm sorry that I haven't been around, Bud.

490
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,676
我一直在想办法。
I've been figuring some stuff out.

491
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,847
你说"搞清楚"是什么意思?这没什么好弄的。
Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"? It is nothing to figure out.

492
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,516
好吧?你睡觉，醒来，喝点咖啡，然后去上班。
Okay? You go to bed, you wake up, you get some coffee, then you come to work.

493
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,251
然后你明天再重复同样的事情。
And then you repeat the same thing tomorrow.

494
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:28,154
――这个女孩。-我的天啊。
- The girl. - Oh, my God.

495
00:32:28,188 --> 00:32:29,455
我和她谈过了。我和她谈过了。
I talked to her. I talked to her.

496
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:32,158
-戴墨镜的那个?-太阳镜，是的!
- The one with the sunglasses? - The sunglasses, yes!

497
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:36,796
我和一个戴太阳镜的人谈过，现在我就是一个戴太阳镜的人。
I talked to one of the sunglass people and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

498
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,297
我。
Me.

499
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,033
所有人都趴到地上!
Everybody down on the ground!

500
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,500
你这么热。
You're so hot.

501
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:44,470
如果我能告诉你，你可以做得更好呢?
What if I could tell you that you could be more?

502
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:45,939
你的生活可以更充实。
Your life could be fuller.

503
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:48,174
你可以自己做决定。你自己的选择。
That you're free to make your own decisions. Your own choices.

504
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:49,241
哟,笨蛋。
Yo, dumbass.

505
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:50,777
我们正忙着呢。
We are in the middle of something.

506
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:55,214
嗯…-那是我的枪。――安静的时间。
Uh... - That's my gun. - Quiet time.

507
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:58,650
这些小狗改变了我的生活。他们也会改变你的。
These puppies changed my life. And they're gonna change yours, too.

508
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:00,619
得了吧，你知道我们不戴太阳镜的。
Come on now, you know we don't wear sunglasses.

509
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:04,456
我们现在做的。
We do now.

510
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,093
我的现在。
Mine now.

511
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:08,660
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me?

512
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,698
-戴上。――没有。
- Put 'em on. - No.

513
00:33:12,731 --> 00:33:14,868
生活不必只是发生在我们身上的事情。好吧?
Life doesn't have to be something that just happens to us. All right?

514
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:17,971
戴上眼镜，你就知道了。
Just put the glasses on and you're gonna see.

515
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:19,671
你会看到。
You're gonna see.

516
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:23,977
来吧。
Come on.

517
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,478
我不能,好吗?
I can't, okay?

518
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:29,614
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

519
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:38,258
我要留着这些，混蛋。
I'm keeping these, asshole mouth.

520
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,794
现在离开这里。是更好的。
Now get out of here. Go be nicer.

521
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,862
击败它。走,走,走。
Beat it. Go, go, go.

522
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,496
不要走,跑了。
Don't walk, run.

523
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,001
和你……啊。
And you... Ugh.

524
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,735
对不起。
Sorry.

525
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:53,072
你能找到比那家伙更好的。
Um, you could do so much better than that guy.

526
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:56,375
你可以和一个好男人在一起。
You could be with, like, a good guy.

527
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,611
也许我不需要和任何男人在一起。
Or maybe I don't have to be with any guy.

528
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:02,248
对吧?完全正确。大多数都很糟糕。
Right? Exactly. Most of them are awful.

529
00:34:02,282 --> 00:34:04,083
-真的。――糟透了。
- They really are. - Terrible.

530
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:05,484
你想怎么做就怎么做。
Yeah, do whatever you wanna do.

531
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,359
你是我最好的朋友，巴迪。
You're my best friend, Buddy.

532
00:34:14,393 --> 00:34:16,695
你不用害怕。
And you don't have to be scared.

533
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:19,665
如果你改变主意了，我会在你身边。
If you change your mind, I'll be around.

534
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:28,107
凯斯，我们的蓝衫男到处都是。
Yo, Keys, our Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

535
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:30,176
我知道。
I know.

536
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,677
这家伙是谁?
Who is this guy?

537
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,308
我在这里。
I'm here.

538
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,077
我真的很感激，凯斯。
I really appreciate this, Keys.

539
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,982
好吧。先说清楚，我现在只是在开门。
Okay. Just to be clear, all I'm doing right now is opening the door.

540
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:13,618
如果这段视频真的证明安特万非法重复使用了我们的代码，那就去找出来。
If this clip really does prove that Antwan reused our code illegally, go find it and get out.

541
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,125
玩家要去市中心的珠宝店。
Player's doing the jewelry store mission in midtown.

542
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,726
你还有5分钟。
That gives you 5 minutes.

543
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,463
和去。
And go.

544
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,975
凯斯，你真是个天才。
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

545
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,243
真的吗?
Really?

546
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:40,512
我现在正坐在马桶上，偷用户代码，所以我不觉得自己是。
I'm sitting on the toilet right now, stealing user codes, so I don't exactly feel like one.

547
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:41,981
哦，你从来没有。
Oh, you never have.

548
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,150
还好我知道得更多。
Good thing I know better.

549
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,552
好吧。你要找的夹子应该在你左边的墙上。
All right. The clip you're looking for should be on the wall to your left.

550
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:49,488
-谢谢你的帮助。-没问题。
- Thanks for the assist. - You got it.

551
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:51,057
我希望它有你想要的证据。
I hope it has the proof you're looking for.

552
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:17,817
键!我需要你的帮助!
Keys! I need your help!

553
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,651
他把那地方设了陷阱，还设了产卵点。
He's got that place booby-trapped with spawn points.

554
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:20,954
米莉，我帮不了你。
Millie, I can't help you.

555
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:43,675
蓝色衬衫的家伙吗?
Blue Shirt Guy?

556
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:47,579
这是亨利。这是酷吗?感觉真的很酷。
It's a Henley. Was that cool? It felt really cool.

557
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:51,050
你看起来真漂亮。哇，这房子真漂亮。
You look really pretty. Wow, this house is so nice.

558
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:00,026
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

559
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:02,761
我本来是想偷一段视频，现在我们又想保住性命。
I was trying to steal a video clip, now we're trying not to die.

560
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:04,931
你在跟谁说话?
Who are you talking to?

561
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:10,136
就是那个披着NPC外衣的玩家。
You know, that player in the NPC skin.

562
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:12,537
米莉，那房子里没有其他玩家了。
Millie, there are no other players in that house.

563
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:16,042
我的手真的很疼。
That actually hurt my hand.

564
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,143
下来!
Get down!

565
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,895
我很抱歉!哦,上帝!
I'm sorry! Oh, God!

566
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:14,699
我们做的很好。
We're doing great.

567
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,447
哇!
Wow!

568
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:31,150
我们一定要去!
We should definitely go!

569
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:33,886
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

570
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:43,296
-你口袋里是把格洛克手枪吗?――没有。
- Is that a Glock in your pocket? - No.

571
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:45,263
――什么?-是两把格洛克手枪。
- What? - It's two Glocks.

572
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,631
哦!
Oh!

573
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,968
我看这东西飞不起来。
I don't suppose this thing can fly.

574
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:23,236
不。
No.

575
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:24,337
跳。
Jump.

576
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,205
哇!
Wow!

577
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:30,076
哇!
Whoa!

578
00:39:38,184 --> 00:39:39,684
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

579
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,202
早上好,sheeple !
Good morning, sheeple!

580
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,837
哦，你被解雇了。
Oh, you are fired.

581
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,273
有一些人担心血腥的僵尸，零售商不会携带游戏。
There is some concern with the bloody zombies, retailers won't carry the game.

582
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,041
削减它。结果出来了。从来没有发生过。下一个。
Cut it. It's out. Never even happened. Next.

583
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:06,045
这是你的律师。他们需要你的证词说话。我们说的是哪起诉讼?
It's your lawyers. They need to get your deposition... Speak. Which lawsuit are we talking about?

584
00:40:06,078 --> 00:40:08,781
米莉,米莉鲁斯克?没问题。
Millie, Millie Rusk? No sweat.

585
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:13,618
这种事永远不会在法庭上出现...因为她没有证据而她的前搭档为我工作。
That will never see the inside of a courtroom... because she's got no proof and her ex-partner works for me.

586
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:14,686
我们是黄金。
We're golden.

587
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,222
Antwan,嘿。你看起来很好。
Antwan, hey. You look great.

588
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:17,823
我以为你还在火人节呢。
Uh, I thought you were still at Burning Man.

589
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:20,359
我看起来像还在参加火人节吗?
Oh, does it look like I'm still at Burning Man?

590
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:23,596
你,你,你……不。所以，闭上你的臭脸，听我说。
You, you, you... No. So, shut your stupid, bearded face and listen.

591
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,399
你听说过游戏中有个看起来像NPC的混蛋吗?
You heard about the asshole running around in the game who looks like an NPC?

592
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:29,202
是的,是的。我们叫他蓝衫男。但我们会摆脱他的。
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy. But we're gonna get rid of him.

593
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:32,672
不要摆脱他。像他这样的人。社交媒体上到处都是。不。
Don't get rid of him. People like him. It's all over social media. No.

594
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:35,808
知道我要做什么吗?我要用自由之城2号的皮肤。
In fact, know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna use the skin in Free City 2.

595
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:39,345
哦,艺术书呆子!我们要升级一下蓝衫，好吗?
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

596
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:41,414
的合成类固醇。让他成为杀手之类的。
'Roid him out. Make him a hitman or something.

597
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:44,584
Antwan，我们已经远远落后于从自由之城1移植皮肤。
Antwan, we're already way behind porting over the skins from Free City 1.

598
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:46,118
皮吗?不用担心这个。
Skins? Don't even worry about that.

599
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,954
在《自由之城2》中无法使用。
They won't be usable in Free City 2.

600
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,557
安特万，你告诉粉丝们…《Free City 2》是向后兼容的。广告里有。
Antwan, you told the fans... Free City 2 is backwards compatible. It was in the commercial.

601
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:53,925
你说续集里会有同样的角色。
You said there'd be the same characters in the sequel.

602
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,330
事情是这样的。当我说那些话的时候，我在撒谎。
Well, here's the thing. When I said that, I was lying.

603
00:40:57,363 --> 00:40:59,832
听着，安特万，这个游戏已经比以前更有问题了。
Listen, Antwan, the game is already buggier than ever.

604
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:01,434
我收到了一堆用户投诉，差不多有一英里高。
I got a stack of user complaints, like a mile high.

605
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:03,069
听着，我知道这很糟糕。
Look, I know it sucks.

606
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:07,406
但知识产权的认可度非常高。好吧?所以不用担心。
But the IP recognition is rock hard. Okay? So don't even worry about it.

607
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,710
我只是说，我们可以做一款原创游戏。
I'm just saying, we could make an original game.

608
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:12,245
什么?
What?

609
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:14,513
让一个原始吗?既然我可以拍续集，我为什么要这么做?
Make an original? Why would I do that when I could make a sequel?

610
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:15,581
一个续集。
A sequel.

611
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:16,983
这样我们就能做得更好?
So we can make it better?

612
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,885
ip和续集才是人们想要的东西。
IPs and sequels, that is the thing that people want.

613
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:21,153
-我问你个问题。――好的。
- Let me ask you a question. - Okay.

614
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,722
你喜欢肯德基，对吧?
You love Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?

615
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:24,323
――嗯。――没有。
- Mmm-hmm. - No.

616
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:32,865
如果你爱吃肯德基炸鸡，我也做肯德基炸鸡，我也知道你爱吃肯德基炸鸡，那我为什么要开一家叫"阿尔伯克基水煮火鸡"的餐厅呢?
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken, and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken, and I know that you love Kentucky Fried Chicken, why would I make another restaurant called,uh, I don't know, "Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

617
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:34,766
――好吗?说不通啊，兄弟。――嗯。毫无意义的。
- Okay? Makes no sense, homie. - Mmm-hmm. No sense.

618
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,038
我要给你什么?一个续集。肯德基炸鸡，第二部分。
What am I gonna give you? A sequel. Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken, Part Two.

619
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:41,474
嗯,百胜。让他见鬼去吧。
Uh, yum. Drop the deuce on him.

620
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:43,776
来吧。到这里来。到这里来。
Come on. Come here. Come here.

621
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:47,313
我不想让你强调你那个伟大的洗发水广告头。
I don't want you to stress that glorious shampoo commercial head of yours about it.

622
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:50,783
《自由之城2》会很疯狂的。
Free City 2 is gonna be jumunjious.

623
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,818
这不是一个词。
That's not a word.

624
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,254
你确定你不想去编程吗?
You sure you don't wanna bump up to programming?

625
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:59,125
我知道你有这个头脑。
I know you got the brains for it.

626
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:01,560
不,谢谢。我现在就很好。
No thanks. I'm good right where I am.

627
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:08,000
爱死它了。对飞行的恐惧。我不知道该怎么说。
Love it. Fear of flying. Can't say I can relate.

628
00:42:08,034 --> 00:42:10,503
但如果我不用付你更多的钱，那就没事了。
But all good with me if I don't have to pay you more.

629
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:12,171
Antwan出来。
Antwan out.

630
00:42:22,783 --> 00:42:24,350
这家伙是谁?
Who is this guy?

631
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:33,659
哇!
Wow!

632
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:35,328
我采纳了你的建议。
I took your advice.

633
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,431
我被夷为平地。
I leveled up.

634
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:40,833
让人印象深刻。
Impressive.

635
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,370
你为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing all of this?

636
00:42:44,403 --> 00:42:48,541
我觉得自己被困住了。
You know, I guess I felt... trapped.

637
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,310
你知道，在我的生命中。
You know, in my life.

638
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:55,214
我只是觉得…卡住了。
I just felt so... Stuck.

639
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,985
是的。然后我看到了你。
Yeah. And then I saw you.

640
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:03,189
然后我看到了你。
Then I saw you.

641
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:05,257
你是谁?
Who are you?

642
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:07,093
我是Guy。
I'm Guy.

643
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,395
不，你到底是谁?
No, who are you really?

644
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:10,262
还是人。
Still Guy.

645
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:15,101
这一切，升级得太快了。
All of this, leveling up so fast.

646
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,703
向整个世界竖起中指。
Giving this whole world the finger.

647
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:19,038
你是怎么做到的?
How are you pulling this off?

648
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:22,074
我从没给过任何人我的手指。
I've never given anyone any of my fingers.

649
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:23,943
你在顺南工作，对吧?
You work at Soonami, don't you?

650
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,779
――没有。-你有内线。
- No. - You've got an inside track.

651
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,513
-我在银行工作。――正确的。银行。
- I work at the bank. - Right. The bank.

652
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:31,884
所以，你只是个碰巧在银行工作的超级黑客。
So, you're just this incredible hacker who happens to work at the bank.

653
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,486
是的，我在银行工作。
Yes, I work at the bank.

654
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,654
你的皮肤从哪儿来的?
Where did you get that skin?

655
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,557
它一直都在那里。
It's always sort of been there.

656
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:40,993
为什么人们总是问我这个问题?
Why do people keep asking me that question?

657
00:43:41,026 --> 00:43:43,028
我不知道，为什么?
I don't know, why do they?

658
00:43:46,065 --> 00:43:51,670
不,不。不这样做。我…现在发生了什么?
No, no. Not doing that. I... What's happening right now?

659
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:53,639
我不知道，但我不信。
I don't know, but I don't buy it.

660
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,007
不。
No.

661
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,976
――好,好。我忘记它了。――好。好。
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it. - Fine. Good.

662
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,444
-我会放手的。――是的。
- I'll let it go. - Yes.

663
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:00,112
太好了。
Great.

664
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:01,714
我想我们都有自己的秘密。
We all have our secrets, I guess.

665
00:44:01,747 --> 00:44:03,416
是的,我们做的。
Yes, we do.

666
00:44:06,152 --> 00:44:07,153
嘿。
Hey.

667
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:10,556
你喜欢冰淇淋吗?
Do you like ice cream?

668
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:13,827
真不敢相信我从没来过这里。
I can't believe I've never been here.

669
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,761
嗯，这是一个秘密。
Well, it's sort of a secret.

670
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:19,565
这就是为什么我和我的朋友，巴迪，总是来这里。这里既安静又安全。
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy, always come here. It's quiet and safe.

671
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:21,300
是的，这很有道理。
Yeah, it makes sense.

672
00:44:22,468 --> 00:44:25,070
没有任务。
No missions here.

673
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:28,407
你得试试这个。你会觉得我疯了。
Oh, you gotta try this. You're gonna think I'm crazy.

674
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:30,042
这是全世界我最喜欢的口味。
This is my favorite flavor in the whole world.

675
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:31,210
我们要两张平常的。
We'll take two of the usual, please.

676
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:32,545
你说对了，盖伊。
You got it, Guy.

677
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:34,647
这是泡泡糖的味道。
It's bubble gum flavor.

678
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,482
你认为我疯了，是吗?
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

679
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:40,753
Guy……滚出我的脑洞!我喜欢泡泡糖冰淇淋。
Guy... Get out of my brain hole! I love bubble gum ice cream.

680
00:44:40,787 --> 00:44:42,755
不,你没有。你是在取笑我吗?
No, you don't. Are you making fun of me right now?

681
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:45,257
不!没有人喜欢泡泡糖冰淇淋。
No! Nobody likes bubble gum ice cream.

682
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,358
不,我做的。
No, I do.

683
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,794
我曾经在泡泡糖冰淇淋上结束了一段感情。
I had a relationship end over bubble gum ice cream.

684
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:49,061
――没有。在这里。-是的。
- No way. Here. - Yeah.

685
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:50,729
――干杯。――干杯。
- Cheers. - Cheers.

686
00:44:50,763 --> 00:44:52,031
嗯。
Mmm.

687
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,432
这有多好?
How good is that?

688
00:44:53,466 --> 00:44:54,599
你能尝出来吗?
You can taste it?

689
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:58,304
味道吗?就像我的舌头生了个婴儿。
Taste it? It's like my tongue had a baby with a sunrise.

690
00:44:58,337 --> 00:44:59,638
――嗯?――嗯。
- Mmm-hmm? - Mmm.

691
00:45:00,941 --> 00:45:05,377
咖啡曾经是我最喜欢的食物，但与这个相比，它尝起来就像液体的痛苦。
Coffee used to be my favorite food, but compared to this, it tastes like liquid suffering.

692
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,480
什么?
What?

693
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:13,118
什么都没有。你有趣。
Nothing. You're funny.

694
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:15,789
――我是谁?-是的。
- I am? - Yeah.

695
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:18,256
奇怪的有趣。
Weird funny.

696
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,893
但这就是我的速度。
But that's kind of my speed.

697
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,062
奇怪的是，这也是我的速度。
Weird funny, that's totally my speed, too.

698
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,097
――太棒了。-是的。我知道一个笑话。
- Great. - Yeah. I know a joke.

699
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,732
一个奇怪的有趣的笑话。你想听吗?
A weird funny joke. You wanna hear it?

700
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,501
――请。――好的。
- Please. - Okay.

701
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:35,809
一个同性恋者和一个坐轮椅的人试图谋杀一个很小的孩子…-跛子对同性恋说…――哇。停下来,停下来。
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair are trying to murder a very small child... - The cripple says to the homosexual... - Whoa. Stop, stop.

702
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:38,010
停!你从哪儿听说的?
Stop! Where did you hear that?

703
00:45:38,043 --> 00:45:43,916
一个抢劫。枪手把这段话告诉了司机，司机觉得很搞笑，所以我就把这段话记了下来，告诉了所有人。
A robbery. The gunman told it to the driver who thought it was hilarious, so I memorized it and told everyone.

704
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,718
忠告?
Word of advice?

705
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,021
你的笑话可别从自由之城的巨魔那里抄来。
Don't crib your jokes from the trolls of Free City.

706
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:50,155
巨魔吗?
Trolls?

707
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:51,657
那是秋千吗?
Is that a swing set?

708
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:18,317
神圣的…
Holy...

709
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:28,561
好吧，这太奇怪了。
Okay, this is too weird.

710
00:46:28,593 --> 00:46:31,664
复古玛丽亚，泡泡糖冰淇淋，现在又有秋千?
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice cream, and now swings?

711
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:34,133
-这太奇怪了。-我也这么想。
- This is too weird. - I thought the same thing, too.

712
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,568
我也这么想。
I thought the same thing.

713
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,737
我年轻的时候，对秋千很着迷。
When I was younger, I was obsessed with swings.

714
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:44,911
在我的家庭长大，这是…你不会想听的。不。
Growing up in my family, it was... You don't wanna hear this. No.

715
00:46:44,945 --> 00:46:47,079
我想知道你的一切。
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

716
00:46:47,112 --> 00:46:48,747
哦。
Oh.

717
00:46:48,782 --> 00:46:52,117
在我的家庭里长大，还不够好。
Growing up in my family, it wasn't good enough to be great.

718
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:58,524
你必须赢，而那种压力，你知道，是恒定的。
You had to win, and that pressure, you know, it was just constant.

719
00:46:58,557 --> 00:47:09,568
但当我在后院里荡秋千的时候…你知道那一刻，在上升和下降之间的那一刹那，你完全失重了，感觉就像自由了。
But when I was in the backyard on that little swing... You know that moment, that split second between rising and falling, when you're totally weightless, it feels like you're free.

720
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:10,636
恋爱中。
In love.

721
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:12,839
自由。你所说的。是的。
Free. What you said. Yeah.

722
00:47:15,608 --> 00:47:17,811
我真的很想吻你。这是奇怪的吗?
I really wanna kiss you. Is that weird?

723
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:20,512
你想吻我吗?
You want to kiss me?

724
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:24,216
我好想吻你。
I wanna kiss you so badly.

725
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:25,718
你很想吻我?
You want to kiss me badly?

726
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:27,152
――不!――不是吗?
- No! - No?

727
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:29,089
不不不不。我想好好吻你。
No, no, no, no, no. I wanna kiss you well.

728
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:32,358
我是说，我是个白痴，所以我有时会像个白痴一样说话。
I mean, I'm an idiot, so I say things like an idiot sometimes.

729
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,927
不,你不是。你不是。
No, you're not. You're not.

730
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,865
我是说，如果你知道怎么做，那就去做吧。
I mean, um, uh, if you know how to, go for it.

731
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,232
我知道怎么做。
I know how.

732
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,434
好吧。
Okay.

733
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,171
在这里。
Here it goes.

734
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,665
那可比冰淇淋好吃多了。
That was so much better than ice cream.

735
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:14,034
哇!
Whoa!

736
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,701
我想有人在敲门。
I think someone's at the door.

737
00:48:15,734 --> 00:48:16,836
我也有同感。
I'll say.

738
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,603
这真是太棒了。
Well, this was great.

739
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:21,876
-是啊-我们不久再见面吧。是吗?
- Yeah, it was. - Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

740
00:48:21,908 --> 00:48:23,843
是的。肯定。
Yes. Definitely.

741
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:25,477
也许在现实世界中。
Maybe in the real world.

742
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:26,913
什么?
What?

743
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,347
是的。是的,是的,是的。
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

744
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,882
――好的。再见。――好的。
- Okay. Bye. - Okay.

745
00:48:31,183 --> 00:48:33,119
再见,莫洛托夫。
Bye, Molotov.

746
00:48:33,153 --> 00:48:37,222
嘿…我的真名是米莉。
Hey... my real name is Millie.

747
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:42,227
我的真名还是盖伊。
My real name continues to be Guy.

748
00:48:48,935 --> 00:48:51,805
米莉,开放!米莉，是我，是凯斯!打开!来吧!
Millie, open up! Millie, it's me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

749
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:54,907
米莉!是我，开门!
Millie! It's me, open up!

750
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:57,309
――什么?-你是对的。
- What? - You were right.

751
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:59,344
-你是对的。-进来吧。
- You were right. - Oh, come on in.

752
00:48:59,378 --> 00:49:04,717
你是对的。我们的代码，在自由城，米莉，很好用。
You were right. Our code, it is in Free City and, Millie, it works.

753
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,452
是的,我知道。但我们没有证据。
Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof.

754
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,520
先把这事忘了吧。
Just forget about that for one second.

755
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:15,161
我想说的是，我们的游戏《Life Itself》中，角色的成长和改变让人感觉很真实……――是吗?-…工作。
I'm saying that our game, Life Itself, where characters would grow and change and feel real... - Yeah? - ...worked.

756
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:16,930
――钥匙。-人工智能成功了。
- Keys. - The AI worked.

757
00:49:16,963 --> 00:49:20,399
这就是为什么自由城如此现实，人们如此喜爱它的原因。
It's the reason why Free City is so realistic and people love it so much.

758
00:49:20,432 --> 00:49:22,434
当然，看起来也不一样了。
And of course it doesn't look the same.

759
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:28,174
没有瀑布，没有蝴蝶和独角兽，所有的角色都有不同的皮肤。当然了。
There's no waterfalls, there's no butterflies and unicorns, all the characters have different skins. Of course they do.

760
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:33,046
但游戏的基本代码是一样的。我们的代码。
But the underlying code in the game is the same. Our code.

761
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:36,149
至于盖伊，我是说，他已经进化得远远超出了我们的想象。
And Guy, I mean, he has evolved way further than we thought was even possible.

762
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,450
等等，你是说那个披着NPC皮的黑客吗?
Wait, are you talking about the hacker in the NPC skin?

763
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:43,255
米莉，我是说那个蓝衫男…是吗?
Millie, I'm talking about the fact that Blue Shirt Guy... Yeah?

764
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:45,125
．..不是玩家。
...is not a player.

765
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:48,128
他是一个自认为还活着的算法。
He is an algorithm who thinks he's alive.

766
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:50,362
严格来说，他还活着。
I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.

767
00:49:50,395 --> 00:49:54,666
他是第一个真正的人工智能。
He is the first real artificial intelligence.

768
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,937
――不!不。――我知道。
- No! No. - I know.

769
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:59,371
-不不不。-是的,是的。
- No, no, no. - Yeah, yeah.

770
00:49:59,404 --> 00:50:01,007
――Guy?我的Guy?――Guy。
- Guy? My Guy? - Guy.

771
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,274
-一个曾经…――你的Guy?
- One who has been... - Your Guy?

772
00:50:02,307 --> 00:50:03,709
-圣…-这是件好事。
- Holy... - This is a good thing.

773
00:50:03,742 --> 00:50:05,111
不，真的很糟糕。
No, it's really bad.

774
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:08,714
米莉，他的代码，比应该的要大几千倍。
Millie, his code, it's thousands of times the size it should be.

775
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:10,883
我们成功了，米尔斯。
We did it, Mills.

776
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:14,954
我们做到了。我们想要创造的一切，都成真了。
We did it. Everything that we wanted to create, it actually happened.

777
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:18,825
好吧?你知道npc也有私人生活吗?
Okay? Did you know that the NPCs have private lives?

778
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:21,060
其中一位咖啡师通过反复试验学会了如何制作卡布奇诺。
One of the baristas learned how to make a cappuccino through trial and error.

779
00:50:21,094 --> 00:50:23,428
我的意思是，这真的很难。我都做不到。
I mean, that's really difficult. I can't even do that.

780
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:25,697
我连早上自己的燕麦奶都起泡不了。
I can't even froth my own oat milk in the morning.

781
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:35,008
游戏中的Bombshell角色写了一本回忆录，对性别角色、父权制……在某些方面有点说教，但总的来说，还是不错的。
And the Bombshell character in the game wrote a memoir that's a searing indictment of gender roles, the patriarchy... It's a little preachy in parts, but overall, it's pretty good.

782
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,375
米莉，我们得庆祝一下!
Millie, we have to celebrate!

783
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,877
-不，这不可能。-你在说什么?
- No, this can't be happening. - What are you talking about?

784
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,712
-这就是我们努力的目标!-不，我让他吻我的!
- This is what we've been working for! - No, I let him kiss me!

785
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:43,682
所以,是的。
So, yeah.

786
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,720
抱歉，等等，你让谁吻你了?
I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?

787
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,789
伙计。
Guy.

788
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,091
伙计?
Guy?

789
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:59,464
这是我有生以来第一次吻一个无毒的男人当然他根本不是真的!
The first time I kiss a non-toxic guy in like forever and of course he's not even real!

790
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:00,967
没有对应的按钮。
Uh, there's not a button for that.

791
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:03,335
哦，他找到按钮了。
Oh, he found the button.

792
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:04,770
――好的。-是的。
- Okay. - Yeah.

793
00:51:04,804 --> 00:51:07,339
-…我很困惑。-为什么这么热?
- I am... I'm so confused. - Why is it so hot?

794
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:09,210
和惊人的好奇。
And surprisingly curious.

795
00:51:09,242 --> 00:51:15,581
你让一个人工智能的电子游戏角色吻你?-好吧，你能别这么说了吗?
You let an artificially intelligent - video game character kiss you? - Oh, okay, can you just stop saying it like that?

796
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,483
然后你认为那将是…因为你得见见他，凯斯。
And then you thought that would be... Because you have got to meet him, Keys.

797
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:21,586
他很风趣，很贴心，很帅。
He's funny, and he's sweet, and he's so handsome.

798
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,923
天啊，现在我要大声说出来了。
Oh, my God, now I'm saying it out loud.

799
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:28,094
还有，米莉，发人深省的东西，他才四岁。
Also, Millie, food for thought, he's like four.

800
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:30,897
――真的吗?你要这么做?――真的。
- Really? You're gonna do that? - Really.

801
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,832
你说得真吓人。
Wow, you just made that really creepy.

802
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:39,238
米莉，把这些都放在一边。不管奇怪与否，当人们发现这件事时，你可能会获得诺贝尔奖。哦,上帝。
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or not, when people find out about this, you could win a Nobel Prize. Oh, God.

803
00:51:39,272 --> 00:51:40,306
什么?
What?

804
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,508
天啊，如果他们看到这个…――什么?它是什么?――哦!
Oh, my God, if they see this... - What? What is it? - Oh!

805
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:45,510
Antwan。还有什么?
Antwan. What else?

806
00:51:45,544 --> 00:51:50,382
他是在撒谎。他撒谎说用了我们的代码，他撒谎说游戏是向后兼容的。
He's lying. He lied about using our code, he's been lying about the game being backwards compatible.

807
00:51:50,415 --> 00:51:51,918
我觉得关于自由之城1号他在撒谎。
I think he's lying about Free City 1.

808
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:53,219
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

809
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:59,259
看。你看到了什么?没有一个任务，没有一个地点…我是说，这上面连一个《自由之城1》的角色都没有。
Look. You see? There's not one mission, not one location... I mean, there's not even a single character from Free City 1 on here.

810
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:02,295
《自由之城2》不是更新…-这是替代品。――没错。
Free City 2 is not an update... - It's a replacement. - Exactly.

811
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:07,499
所以当《自由之城2》周一发布时…蓝衫男，我们代码的所有证据，都会被删除。
So when Free City 2 launches on Monday... Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code, everything will be deleted.

812
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,235
他不能那样做。
He can't do that.

813
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:12,404
我是说，我们面对的是人造生命。我是说，这太疯狂了。
I mean, this is artificial life we're dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

814
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:17,043
我们就完蛋了。
We're screwed.

815
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,611
也许不是。
Maybe not.

816
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:24,750
如果我们能在游戏中找到我们的原始构建，就能证明Antwan在没有适当授权的情况下使用了我们的代码。
If we can find our original build in the game, it'll prove that Antwan used our code without properly licensing it.

817
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:27,220
我们只需要在《自由之城2》发行前找到它。
And we just have to find it before Free City 2 launches.

818
00:52:27,253 --> 00:52:28,553
我们有48小时。
We have 48 hours.

819
00:52:28,587 --> 00:52:30,223
我看了看,钥匙。你知道我有。
I've looked, Keys. You know I have.

820
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:31,490
我知道你有。
I know you have.

821
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:35,627
但现在我们都知道蓝衫男了，也许他能帮上忙?
But now that we both know about Blue Shirt Guy, maybe he can help?

822
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,997
那就意味着我得告诉他。
That would mean I'd have to tell him.

823
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:41,100
米莉，续集上映后他就不存在了。
Millie, he's not gonna exist once the sequel launches.

824
00:52:42,402 --> 00:52:44,370
他的整个世界就要毁灭了。
His whole world's about to end.

825
00:52:44,404 --> 00:52:46,705
你不觉得他想要一个机会来挽救吗?
Don't you think he'd want a chance to save it?

826
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,010
-给你。――谢谢。
- Here you go. - Thank you.

827
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:53,146
-没问题。――人?
- You got it. - Guy?

828
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:54,479
嘿!这就跟你问声好！
Hey! Hi!

829
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:56,049
伙计，我们得谈谈。
Guy, we need to talk.

830
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:58,851
你的声音怎么了?你的澳大利亚口音呢?
What's going on with your voice? Where's your Australian accent?

831
00:52:58,885 --> 00:52:59,919
英国人。
British.

832
00:52:59,953 --> 00:53:02,521
我觉得我能分辨出澳大利亚口音。
I think I know an Australian accent when I see one.

833
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,123
我把口音滤镜关掉了。
I turned off the accent filter.

834
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,758
这就是我。
This is me.

835
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:08,194
好。
Good.

836
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,396
听着，我有件很重要的事要告诉你。
Look, I have to tell you something really important.

837
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,730
你结婚了吗?
Are you married?

838
00:53:11,763 --> 00:53:12,597
不。
No.

839
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:15,969
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

840
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,071
那将会是最糟糕的事情。
That would have been like the worst thing ever.

841
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:20,006
也许还不是最糟糕的。
Maybe not the worst thing.

842
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,506
嗯。
Huh.

843
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,242
我得给你看样东西。
I have to show you something.

844
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,610
好吧。
Okay.

845
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:31,851
哇!
Wow!

846
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:33,953
我一直想知道这里面有什么。
I always wondered what was in here.

847
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:42,095
敬请收看《杀戮摄像机》为您带来更多今天自由城每一个血腥，子弹遍布的角落的精彩片段。
Tune in to the Kill Cam for more of today's highlights of every bloody, bullet-ridden corner of Free City.

848
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:43,729
有人看见我的猫了吗?
Has anyone seen my cat?

849
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,500
嘿,这是菲利斯。她总是丢她的猫。
Hey, that's Phyllis. She's always losing her cats.

850
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:52,305
还有乔!他是我朋友，我认识他。
And there's Joe! He's my friend, I know that guy.

851
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:54,340
我不明白。这是什么地方?
I don't get it. What is this place?

852
00:53:54,374 --> 00:53:58,978
说这话不太容易，但这座城市就是个游戏。
There is no easy way to say this, but this city is a game.

853
00:53:59,012 --> 00:54:01,513
很难开口，我知道这是个游戏。
There's no easy way to say this, I know it's a game.

854
00:54:01,546 --> 00:54:03,449
是你教我怎么玩的。Boop-boop。
You taught me how to play it. Boop-boop.

855
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:04,884
是的，你说得对。
Yes, you're right, I did.

856
00:54:04,918 --> 00:54:08,754
但这不仅仅是一场游戏。这是一个游戏。
But it's not just that it's like a game. It is a game.

857
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:12,225
这是一个电子游戏。就是这样。
It's a video game. And that's all it is.

858
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:15,228
所以整个世界就是一场游戏?
So the entire world is a game?

859
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:16,362
是的。
Yes.

860
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:18,364
我们都只是游戏中的玩家吗?
And we're all just players in the game?

861
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,664
不完全是。
Not exactly.

862
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,102
我是一个球员。
I'm a player.

863
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:26,772
这里所有的人都是玩家。我们生活在现实世界中。
All these people here are players. We live in the real world.

864
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,540
但你只存在于这里。
But you only exist here.

865
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:31,344
这就是为什么你永远不能离开自由之城。
It's why you can never leave Free City.

866
00:54:31,377 --> 00:54:33,279
你就是我们所说的NPC。
You're what we call an NPC.

867
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,546
全国人大。
NPC.

868
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:38,918
警察和强壮的兔子，他们这么叫我。什么是NPC?
The policeman and the muscular bunny rabbit, they called me that. What is an NPC?

869
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,386
-让我们来…――只是观察。
- Let's take... - Just watch.

870
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,888
．..再看看排行榜。
...another look at that leaderboard.

871
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:43,189
所有人趴到地上!
Everybody get down on the ground!

872
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:44,689
没人想当英雄。
Nobody try to be a hero.

873
00:54:44,723 --> 00:54:46,225
这一切很快就会结束。
This will all be over soon.

874
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:47,493
我不明白你的意思。
I don't understand.

875
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:49,896
你是非玩家角色。
You're a non-player character.

876
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:52,331
-非…-有背景的人。
- Non... - A background person.

877
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:55,802
有人设计让游戏对真实的人来说更有趣。
Someone designed to make the game more fun for real people.

878
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:58,037
等等，等一下。停一下。
Wait, hold on a second. Just stop for a second.

879
00:54:58,071 --> 00:54:59,405
我想确认一下我是不是搞清楚了。
I wanna make sure I'm getting this straight.

880
00:54:59,439 --> 00:55:01,573
我只是想完全理解。
I just wanna fully understand here.

881
00:55:01,606 --> 00:55:04,143
所以,我假的?
So, I'm fake?

882
00:55:04,177 --> 00:55:11,818
整个世界都是假的?我甚至都不是主角，我只是个后台的白痴?
The entire world is fake? I'm not even a main character, I'm just this idiot who's in the background?

883
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,221
米莉，你为什么要这么说?我爱你。
Millie, why are you even saying this? I love you.

884
00:55:15,253 --> 00:55:18,590
你这么想只是因为你的程序里有。
You only think that because it's in your programming.

885
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:26,899
盖伊，我需要你听我说。
Guy, I need you to listen to me.

886
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:29,768
再过两天，游戏就要关闭了。为好。
In two days, the game is gonna shut down. For good.

887
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:36,409
当这款续作发行时，整个城市，包括你在内的所有非玩家都将永远消失。你得听我说。
When this sequel launches, this whole city, you, all the people in it who aren't players, they'll be gone forever. You need to listen.

888
00:55:36,442 --> 00:55:39,512
在我的一生中，我总觉得应该有更多的东西。
My whole life, I felt like there had to be something more.

889
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,746
然后我看到了你。
And then I saw you.

890
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:44,918
我知道我是对的。我是对的!
And I knew I was right. I was right!

891
00:55:45,852 --> 00:55:48,354
有那么一瞬间，我感觉棒极了。
And for a second, I felt amazing.

892
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,288
――我知道。-除非你不知道。
- I know. - Except you don't know.

893
00:55:50,323 --> 00:55:53,226
因为我们不一样。
Because we're not the same.

894
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:54,827
你不是这么说的吗?你说。
Isn't that what you said? You said that.

895
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:57,130
我们不一样。
We're not the same.

896
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:58,697
你是真实的。
You're real.

897
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:01,134
和我什么?我什么?
And I'm what? I'm what?

898
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:06,172
你不是。
You're not.

899
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,310
你不是。
You're not.

900
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:16,983
我可能不是真实存在的，但有那么一瞬间，我觉得自己还活着。
Well, I may not be real, but for a second there... I felt pretty alive.

901
00:57:18,778 --> 00:57:22,014
这全是谎言!
It's all a lie!

902
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:29,355
周五前把季度报告放在我桌上。
Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday.

903
00:57:29,388 --> 00:57:32,024
季度报告。天哪，什么具体的商业行话。
Quarterly reports. My, what specific business lingo.

904
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:34,160
哇。大城市的生活。没有比这更好的了。
Wow. Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it.

905
00:57:34,193 --> 00:57:35,394
直到它粉碎你的灵魂。
Until it crushes your soul.

906
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:40,967
有人看见我的猫了吗?有人看见我的…你的猫吗?没有，菲利斯，我没见过。
Has anyone seen my cat? Has anyone seen my... Your cats? No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

907
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,037
但有个革命性的主意...关上门。
But here's a revolutionary idea... close your goddamn door.

908
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:50,843
它们不是爬到另一个上面，形成一个小猫咪塔，然后把锁撬开。
It's not like they're climbing on top of one another, forming a little kitty tower, and then jimmying the locks.

909
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:53,179
他们没有拇指，菲利斯。
They don't have thumbs, Phyllis.

910
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:55,314
没有拇指!
No thumbs!

911
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:59,051
你还不明白吗?你们谁都不明白吗?
Don't you get it? Don't any of you get it?

912
00:57:59,085 --> 00:58:03,623
这些都不重要!没有它!这是假的!我们不重要!
None of this matters! None of it! It's fake! We don't matter!

913
00:58:03,656 --> 00:58:08,127
那栋楼，是假的!这条街……这是假的!
That building, that's fake! This street... It's fake!

914
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,262
那辆车……
That car...

915
00:58:15,635 --> 00:58:16,869
约翰尼警官!
Officer Johnny!

916
00:58:16,902 --> 00:58:18,770
祝你愉快，盖伊。
Have a good one, Guy.

917
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:30,916
哦,嗨,呃…进来。
Oh, hey, uh... Come in.

918
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:42,328
给你。
Here you go.

919
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:43,362
谢谢你！
Thank you.

920
00:58:44,463 --> 00:58:51,103
兄弟，如果你发现你不是真实的你会怎么做?
Buddy, what would you do if you found out that you weren't real?

921
00:58:52,471 --> 00:58:53,572
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

922
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:55,374
假装和我。
Pretend with me.

923
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:58,944
好吧,所以…我能假装自己是鬼吗?
Okay, so... Can I pretend I'm a ghost?

924
00:59:00,346 --> 00:59:01,480
确定。
Sure.

925
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:04,817
哦。我看起来像现在这个样子吗?或者当我死的时候?
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now? Or whenever I die?

926
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,018
我是不是穿了丧服?
Like, do I have a funeral outfit on?

927
00:59:06,052 --> 00:59:07,753
-这有点像葬礼…――没关系。
- This is kind of funeral... - Doesn't matter.

928
00:59:07,788 --> 00:59:09,155
．..虽然这是工作制服，因为我打了领带。
...but even though it's a work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

929
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:11,190
我们从这个概念开始，好吗?
Let's move on from the concept, okay?

930
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:13,726
明白了。
Got it.

931
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:18,531
我不是鬼。我很失望，但我能理解。-是的。
I'm not a ghost. I'm very disappointed, - but I get it. - Yeah.

932
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:23,135
我就是我，就是现在的我，我只是想帮助一个朋友。
I'm me, who I am right now, and I'm just trying to help a friend.

933
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,808
我说，好吧，如果我不是真实的呢?
I say, okay, so what if I'm not real?

934
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,842
我很抱歉。“所以什么?”
I'm sorry. "So what?"

935
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:30,910
是的。那又怎样?
Yeah. So what?

936
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:35,481
但如果你不是真实存在的，那不就意味着你做的一切都不重要了吗?
But if you're not real, doesn't that mean that nothing you do matters?

937
00:59:35,514 --> 00:59:42,455
这是什么意思?听着，兄弟，我正和我最好的朋友坐在一起，想帮他度过难关。
What does that mean? Look, brother, I am sitting here with my best friend, trying to help him get through a tough time.

938
00:59:42,488 --> 00:59:47,226
对吧?就算我不是真实存在的，这一刻也是。
Right? And even if I'm not real, this moment is.

939
00:59:48,361 --> 00:59:53,532
就在此时此地。这一刻是真实的。
Right here, right now. This moment is real.

940
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:57,503
我是说，有什么比一个人试图帮助自己爱的人更真实呢?
I mean, what's more real than a person tryin' to help someone they love?

941
00:59:57,536 --> 01:00:02,508
如果那不是真的，我不知道什么是真的了。
Now, if that's not real, I don't know what is.

942
01:00:05,111 --> 01:00:07,646
你认识其他保安吗?
Do you know the other security guards?

943
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,215
我全都知道。为什么?
I know 'em all. Why?

944
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:16,389
嘿，伙计，今天不要过得太好，今天要过得很好。
Hey, Buddy... let's not have a good day... let's have a great day.

945
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,125
伙计，我们在这干什么?
Guy, what are we doin' here?

946
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,828
我们是来给我朋友米莉拿一段视频的。
We're here to get a video clip for my friend Millie.

947
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:23,562
这看起来吓人吗?
Does this look intimidating?

948
01:00:23,596 --> 01:00:25,998
我不知道，盖伊。你怎么拿这东西?
I don't know, Guy. How do you hold this thing?

949
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,876
你有我想要的东西。
You have something I want.

950
01:00:35,908 --> 01:00:37,710
你要把它交出来
And you're gonna hand it over.

951
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:41,313
你怎么进来的?
How'd you get in here?

952
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,549
别紧张。我认识你的保安。
Easy. I know your security guard.

953
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,351
吉米?
Jimmy?

954
01:00:45,384 --> 01:00:46,419
他的名字叫Luigi。
His name is Luigi.

955
01:00:46,452 --> 01:00:50,055
所以如果你花点时间知道他的名字...也许他不会这么快就背叛你。
So if you took some time to learn his name... maybe he wouldn't turn on you so quick.

956
01:00:50,089 --> 01:00:53,894
我需要一段视频，你得给我。
I need a video clip, and you're gonna give it to me.

957
01:00:53,925 --> 01:00:57,864
等一下，你是…你是蓝衫男吗?
Wait a minute, are you... Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

958
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,398
是的,也许吧。
Yeah, maybe.

959
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:02,101
我靠。你是盖伊!你是蓝衫男!是你!
Holy shit! You're Guy! You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

960
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:03,269
-是的。-我爱你。
- Yeah. - I love you.

961
01:01:03,302 --> 01:01:06,238
――你会怎么做?――我的意思是……我就像一个粉丝。你太棒了。
- You do? - I mean... I'm like a fan. You're awesome.

962
01:01:06,272 --> 01:01:07,606
你想要什么都可以。
You can have anything you want.

963
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,641
等等，等一下。
Wait, hold on one second.

964
01:01:08,674 --> 01:01:10,811
游戏玩家们，听好了，我是《Revenjamin Buttons》。
Gamers, listen up, this is Revenjamin Buttons here.

965
01:01:10,844 --> 01:01:12,178
我和盖伊在一起。
I'm here with Guy.

966
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,680
Guy，他在我的藏身处，他是来抢劫我的。
The Guy, he's in my stash house, and he's here to rob me.

967
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:19,051
能给我的粉丝们点什么吗，盖伊?――什么?
Can I get a little... - "what-what" for my followers, Guy? - What?

968
01:01:19,084 --> 01:01:25,257
完美。好吧，现在的情况是盖伊在找一段视频,里面是我进入秘密关卡时的一段攻略。
Perfect. All right, so what's happening is... Guy's looking for a clip... showing a walkthrough I did to get to the secret level.

969
01:01:26,992 --> 01:01:28,593
你在跟谁说话?
Who are you talking to?

970
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:31,363
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

971
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:34,700
我在跟谁说话?这是盖尔的经典台词。
Who am I talking to? It's just such a classic Guy line.

972
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,768
对吧?
Right?

973
01:01:35,802 --> 01:01:41,842
你很好。哦,不管怎样…而你，你想用那个叫莫洛托夫的小妞从我这里偷走它。
You're good. Oh, anyway... And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick.

974
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:43,008
她的名字叫米莉。
Her name's Millie.

975
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:45,244
-是的。等待,是谁?――米莉。
- Yeah. Wait, who? - Millie.

976
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:46,979
我觉得进展得很顺利。
I think it's going really well.

977
01:01:47,012 --> 01:01:50,082
我知道。这是我第一次把枪从枪套里拿出来。
I know. This is literally the first time I took my gun out the holster.

978
01:01:50,115 --> 01:01:51,684
完全。对吧?
Totally. Right?

979
01:01:51,717 --> 01:01:54,887
盖伊，我试过回去，但故障解决了。
Guy, I tried to go back through, but the glitch is patched.

980
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,455
我再也没有找到它。
And I never found it again.

981
01:01:56,489 --> 01:01:58,157
所以我是唯一一个见过另一面的人。
So I'm the only one that ever saw what was on the other side.

982
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,692
但都在这里，你看。
But it's all here, check it out.

983
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:02,428
实际上这很酷。就像另一个世界。
It's pretty cool actually. It's like a whole other world.

984
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:04,730
-就这样?这是游戏剪辑?-对，就是这样。
- This is it? This is the game clip? - Yeah, that's it.

985
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:08,234
你能给我一个，一个，就一个吗?
Can you do one, single, just one solid for me?

986
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,735
-有一件事，我不再问了，好吗?-是的。
- One thing, I'll stop asking, okay? - Yeah.

987
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,470
说我的口头禅。
Just say my catchphrase.

988
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:13,172
如果你这么说，我的观众会把香蕉奶油三明治涂得全身都是。
My viewers will just banana cream sandwich all over themselves if you say it.

989
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:15,007
我喜欢香蕉奶油三明治。
I love banana cream sandwiches.

990
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,108
也许不是这个香蕉奶油三明治。
Maybe not this banana cream sandwich.

991
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,643
是的,这一个。
Yeah, this one.

992
01:02:17,676 --> 01:02:19,445
好的,完美的。好吧，那就说"你知道现在几点了吗"
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just say, "You know what time it is?"

993
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:21,882
-你知道现在几点了吗?-你知道现在几点了吗?
- You know what time it is? - You know what time it is?

994
01:02:21,914 --> 01:02:23,015
你知道现在几点了吗?
You know what time it is?

995
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:24,149
你知道现在几点了吗?
You know what time it is?

996
01:02:24,183 --> 01:02:25,384
你知道现在几点了吗?
You know what time it is?

997
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:26,887
你知道现在几点了吗?
You know what time it is?

998
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,454
你知道现在几点了吗?
You know what time it is?

999
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:30,756
现在是犯罪时刻，宝贝。是的。
It's crime o'clock, baby. Yeah.

1000
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:35,327
这是犯罪啊'cl……但是，不，我不能这么说。这是……好吧。没关系。我自己说。
It's crime o'cl... But, no, I can't say that. That's... Okay. It's all right. I'll say it myself.

1001
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:37,329
-好吧，你知道现在几点了吗?――没有。
- All right, you know what time it is? - No.

1002
01:02:37,363 --> 01:02:39,365
这是犯罪啊'cl……妈妈!
It's crime o'cl... Mom!

1003
01:02:39,398 --> 01:02:42,268
妈妈!你现在是认真的吗?
Mom! Are you serious with the... vacuum right now?

1004
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:46,038
你真的要在这里做吗?我在说我的口头禅!大家都在看!
You really have to do that here? I'm saying my... catchphrase! Everybody's watching!

1005
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:49,009
――上帝!-你才22岁，住在我家，上帝是不存在的!
- God! - You're 22, living in my house, there is no God!

1006
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,142
对不起,Guy。
Sorry, Guy.

1007
01:02:50,175 --> 01:02:53,312
谢谢你，巴顿先生。我们要走了。
Thank you, Mr. Buttons. We're gonna go.

1008
01:02:53,345 --> 01:02:55,114
不,不,不!不，你得杀了我。
No, no, no! No, you gotta kill me.

1009
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,017
-抱歉，什么?-你得杀了我。请杀了我。
- I'm sorry, what? - You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

1010
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:59,385
把它给我，爸爸。把它给我!
Give it to me, Daddy. Give it to me!

1011
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:01,654
不。请不要那样做。请不要那样做。
No. Please don't do that. Please don't do that.

1012
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:03,990
我们不会伤害任何人的。我是个好人。
We're not gonna hurt anybody. I'm a good guy.

1013
01:03:04,024 --> 01:03:05,524
什么?你想说什么?
What? What'd you say?

1014
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,395
这是深。
That's deep.

1015
01:03:09,428 --> 01:03:10,396
不,它不是。
No, it's not.

1016
01:03:10,429 --> 01:03:11,697
就好像我能深深地尝到你的味道。
That's like I can taste you, deep.

1017
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,634
我需要你的帮助，巴迪。我没有密码。
I want your help, Buddy. I don't have the safeword.

1018
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:16,735
我知道你想要什么。
I know what you want.

1019
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:17,871
我不想那样。
I don't want that.

1020
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:18,972
是的,你做的事情。
Yeah, you do.

1021
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:20,205
这是感人。
That's touching.

1022
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:21,540
――他们感人。-是的。
- They're touching. - Yeah.

1023
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:23,342
我知道你想要什么。
I know what you want.

1024
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,710
是的,我喜欢。
Yes, I do.

1025
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:27,379
你想要一点自由之城的激情。
You want a little bit of that Free City Itchy Kitty.

1026
01:03:27,413 --> 01:03:29,214
――没有。――嗯。是的,你做的事情。
- No. - Uh-huh. Yes, you do.

1027
01:03:29,248 --> 01:03:31,183
你走路的样子，都快脏了。
The way you move, it's almost dirty.

1028
01:03:31,216 --> 01:03:36,322
把灭霸手套换成灭霸啪怎么样?
What about a little Thanos Glove... into a little bit of Thanos Snap?

1029
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:38,256
――哦。看起来很疼。-有一点
- Oh. That looked like it hurt. - Yeah, a little bit.

1030
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,525
周日开车。
A little Sunday Drive.

1031
01:03:39,558 --> 01:03:41,293
你的家真漂亮。
You have a beautiful home.

1032
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:44,697
――阴险的男人吗?没有?没有阴险的男人吗?-再见，巴顿先生。
- Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man? - Bye, Mr. Buttons.

1033
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,333
来吧，给我一条蛇!拜托，伙计。
Come on, give me one snake! Just come on, man.

1034
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:49,435
妈妈!别碰那只袜子!
Mom! Do not touch that sock!

1035
01:03:49,468 --> 01:03:53,405
我对天发誓，如果你敢碰那只袜子...你这辈子就得接受治疗了!
I swear to God, if you touch that sock... you will be in therapy for the rest of your life!

1036
01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:56,810
不!那是我的特别袜子!放下!
No! That's my special sock! Put it down!

1037
01:04:01,848 --> 01:04:03,616
米莉。
Millie, please.

1038
01:04:03,649 --> 01:04:06,086
请从你的站立昏迷中醒来。
Please wake up from your standing coma.

1039
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:13,291
听着，我知道这个世界对你来说只是个游戏，你可以来去自如，但对我来说…这个地方，这些人，是我的全部。
Look, I know this world is just a game to you and you can come and go, but to me... this place, these people, that's all I have.

1040
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:18,098
如果我能帮你拯救它，我想这么做……但你得醒醒，求你了。
And if I can help you save it, I wanna do that... but you gotta wake up, please.

1041
01:04:18,163 --> 01:04:19,933
米莉，很抱歉我跑了。
Millie, I'm sorry for running away.

1042
01:04:19,966 --> 01:04:21,700
Guy?
Guy?

1043
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:24,904
哦，太可怕了!它只是可怕。
Oh, that's so scary! It's just terrifying.

1044
01:04:24,938 --> 01:04:26,138
我知道，我知道。
I know, I know.

1045
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:27,841
对不起，对不起。
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1046
01:04:27,874 --> 01:04:30,342
听着，也许你一开始是生活在幕后，但我也是。
Look, you may have started out living in the background, but so did I.

1047
01:04:30,376 --> 01:04:32,378
我们已经做完了。
We're done with that.

1048
01:04:34,014 --> 01:04:35,214
我给你买了个礼物。
I got you a present.

1049
01:04:36,281 --> 01:04:37,650
我没时间包起来。
I didn't have time to wrap it.

1050
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:39,819
什么?
What?

1051
01:04:48,128 --> 01:04:51,230
据说每年有超过10亿的npc被杀死。
They say over a billion NPCs are killed every year.

1052
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:55,869
我不想撒谎，这至少有一半是我的错。
Now, I'm not gonna lie, that's at least 50% my fault.

1053
01:04:55,902 --> 01:05:01,141
我以前无聊的时候会拍次要角色，你知道吗?
I used to shoot all the secondary characters when I was bored, you know?

1054
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:04,543
然后，我会用茶包把它们包起来。
And then, I'd teabag 'em a little bit.

1055
01:05:04,576 --> 01:05:07,446
谁他妈知道这个蓝衫男是谁?
Who the hell even knows who this Blue Shirt Guy is?

1056
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:09,481
但我要告诉你，他让我开始思考
But I'll tell you this, he's got me thinkin'

1057
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:11,216
关于npc和我如何玩游戏。
about NPCs and how I play the game.

1058
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:15,521
这款游戏甚至不是为这样的人设计的，不是为了让一个球员成为一个好人。
The game wasn't even made for someone like this, for a player to be a good guy.

1059
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:17,690
他也是一个非常可爱的人。
He's also a really cute guy.

1060
01:05:17,723 --> 01:05:19,725
不仅仅是脸，你懂的，整件事。
And not just the face, you know, like the whole thing.

1061
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:24,496
说实话，这让我意识到也许我们一直以来对npc的看法都是错误的。
And, honestly, it's got me realizing... maybe we've been thinking about NPCs wrong this whole time.

1062
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,532
我觉得蓝衫男就是个象征?
I think Blue Shirt Guy's like a symbol, you know?

1063
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:28,434
也许人们想做什么就做什么。
Like, maybe people can be whatever they want.

1064
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:30,870
他就像一个偶像。这个词对吗?
He's like an icon. Is that the right word?

1065
01:05:30,903 --> 01:05:33,106
他提醒我们什么是可能的。
Like, he reminds us of what's possible.

1066
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,506
而且，他非常性感。
Also, he's like crazy hot.

1067
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:37,643
哦，天哪，绝对的。我把这些像素点敲得很重。
Oh, my God, totally. I'd hit those pixels hard.

1068
01:05:37,676 --> 01:05:39,179
我们都应该学学蓝衫男。
We should all be more like Blue Shirt Guy.

1069
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:40,512
也许我们应该停止杀戮。
Maybe we just stop the killing.

1070
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:43,083
他死了!你听到我吗?
He's dead! You hear me?

1071
01:05:43,116 --> 01:05:44,683
那个家伙，把他放在这里。
The guy, put him up here.

1072
01:05:44,717 --> 01:05:47,219
把他放到屏幕上。把他放到屏幕上。
Put him up here on the screen. Put him on the screen.

1073
01:05:47,252 --> 01:05:50,990
让我见见他。他就在这里。
Make me see him. There he is.

1074
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:53,559
是的。他来了，那个做善事的小男孩。
Yes. There he is, the little do-gooder.

1075
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:55,095
我以为你喜欢蓝色衬衫。
I thought you liked Blue Shirt.

1076
01:05:55,128 --> 01:05:56,863
别跟我说话!
Don't say words to me!

1077
01:05:56,896 --> 01:06:00,133
大家都忙着在Twitch和YouTube上看这个失败者。
People are so busy watching this loser on Twitch and YouTube.

1078
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,266
你们知道他们没做什么吗?
You know what they're not doing, guys?

1079
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,634
2.伐木工
Buying Free City 2.

1080
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,871
-预售下降了16%。- 60。
- Pre-sales are down 16%. - 60.

1081
01:06:04,904 --> 01:06:06,638
60. 这是不好的。
60. That's bad.

1082
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:09,374
离发射还有48小时。
Oh, we are 48 hours from launch.

1083
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:11,710
是的，他疯了。
Yeah, he's gone viral.

1084
01:06:11,744 --> 01:06:14,948
是啊，一种同时让我得屁股癌和球癌的病毒!
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass and ball cancer at the same time!

1085
01:06:15,782 --> 01:06:18,283
不实用的!
Inoperable!

1086
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:22,621
你知道，这种好人的套路是不好的影响，对整个系列都不好。
You know, this whole good guy routine... it is a bad influence, and is bad for the franchise.

1087
01:06:22,654 --> 01:06:25,224
我要他走。我不管他是谁，赶他走。
I want him gone. I don't care who it is, boot him.

1088
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:26,458
你不能。
You can't.

1089
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:28,194
哦，对不起，什么?
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1090
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:29,594
你不能。
You can't.

1091
01:06:29,628 --> 01:06:30,696
为什么不呢?
Why not?

1092
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:33,432
因为他不是黑客，安特万。他是一个人大。
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan. He's an NPC.

1093
01:06:33,465 --> 01:06:37,469
你是想告诉我所有关于有自我意识的NPC的屁话都是真的?
You're tryin' to tell me that all this shit about a self-aware NPC is real?

1094
01:06:37,503 --> 01:06:40,773
是的。我不知道怎么回事，也不知道为什么，但他是真的。
Yeah. I don't know how or why, but he's real.

1095
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,843
我该怎么办?我该怎么办?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

1096
01:06:46,311 --> 01:06:48,380
好吧，好吧，好吧。
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1097
01:06:48,413 --> 01:06:50,716
要做什么吗?要做什么吗?明白了。
What to do? What to do? Got it.

1098
01:06:52,317 --> 01:06:53,787
和kip-up !
And kip-up!

1099
01:06:57,322 --> 01:06:58,757
所以我们不能把他踢出比赛。
So we can't kick him out of the game.

1100
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:01,928
我们怎么重置他的人工智能?想法,人。来吧。
How do we reset his AI? Ideas, people. Come on.

1101
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:03,595
打我。想法。
Hit me. Ideas.

1102
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:05,265
你可以重新启动服务器。
You could just reboot the server.

1103
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,331
继续说。
Keep talking.

1104
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:11,137
如果我们重启服务器...他就会变成一个普通的非玩家。
If we reboot the server... then he's just gonna revert back to a regular non-player guy.

1105
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:13,305
――解决方案。――Antwan。
- Solution. - Antwan.

1106
01:07:13,338 --> 01:07:17,743
安特万，你现在是在说终结第一个被确认的人工智能生命?
Antwan, you're talking about terminating... the first confirmed artificially intelligent life-form right now, okay?

1107
01:07:17,777 --> 01:07:19,545
亲爱的，亲爱的。嘘。
Honey, honey. Shush.

1108
01:07:20,312 --> 01:07:21,747
他在亏我的钱。
He's losing me money.

1109
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:25,251
所以，我才不管他是不是该死的阿诺德-施瓦岑-维德。
So, I don't care if he's Arnold-Frickin'- Schwarzen-Vader.

1110
01:07:25,285 --> 01:07:26,786
终止他。重启。
Terminate him. Reboot.

1111
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,788
- 这就去。-你不能这么做。
- On it. - You can't do that.

1112
01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:29,823
重启!
Reboot!

1113
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:45,238
点餐，用一大杯杀人果汁淹没你的嗜血欲望。
Order up and drown your bloodlust... with a tall glass of murder juice.

1114
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:47,339
以下是本周的亮点。
Here's this week's highlights.

1115
01:07:47,372 --> 01:07:49,641
他的身体很有表现力。
He's very expressive with his body.

1116
01:07:49,675 --> 01:07:50,609
清楚。
Clearly.

1117
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:51,845
那是什么?
What is that?

1118
01:07:51,878 --> 01:07:53,378
那边是一个全新的世界。
It's a whole new world over there.

1119
01:07:53,412 --> 01:07:54,981
有点像天堂之类的。
Some kinda paradise and shit.

1120
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:56,415
我的天啊，就是这样。
Oh, my God, that's it.

1121
01:07:56,448 --> 01:08:00,887
这是我们最初的构建，而那个构建是我们代码存在于游戏中的证明。
It's our original build and that build is proof our code is in the game.

1122
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,222
你不知道我等这一刻等了多久。
You have no idea how long I've waited for this.

1123
01:08:03,256 --> 01:08:04,824
我看过这个地方。
I've seen this place.

1124
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:06,159
什么?
What?

1125
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:13,166
是的。
Yeah.

1126
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,068
你什么意思?你怎么可能看到的?
What do you mean? How could you have possibly seen it?

1127
01:08:19,404 --> 01:08:21,506
米莉吗?米莉吗?
Millie? Millie?

1128
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,754
我们是黑暗。自由之城已经下线。
We're dark. Free City is offline.

1129
01:09:16,329 --> 01:09:18,398
发生了什么?
What is happening?

1130
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:24,770
再见,蓝色的衬衫。
Bye-bye, Blue Shirt.

1131
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:27,140
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

1132
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:47,160
没关系。来吧。
It's okay. Come on.

1133
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,700
来吧。
Come on.

1134
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:57,236
快点，快点，快点。
Come on, come on, come on.

1135
01:10:02,641 --> 01:10:04,243
早上好,高迪。
Good morning, Goldie.

1136
01:10:08,714 --> 01:10:17,123
在温暖干燥的枪林弹雨中夹杂着午后的刺伤，你可能会在周二晚上的早些时候被无辜的人的鲜血浸湿在街道上。
Front of warm, dry gunfire... mixed with late afternoon stabbings... could leave you in the streets wet with the blood of innocents... by early Tuesday night.

1137
01:10:17,156 --> 01:10:20,126
浅焙和深焙的真正区别是什么?
What really is the difference between a light roast and a dark roast?

1138
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,693
没有人知道。
Nobody knows.

1139
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:23,495
没有美好的一天，要有美好的一天。
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

1140
01:10:23,528 --> 01:10:24,730
伙计，我们能谈谈吗?
Guy, can we talk?

1141
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:26,065
戴墨镜的女孩怎么知道你的名字?
How does the sunglass girl know your name?

1142
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:26,933
我不知道。一直走。
I don't know. Keep walking.

1143
01:10:26,966 --> 01:10:28,533
来吧,伙计!你知道我。
Come on, Guy! You know me.

1144
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:30,569
你知道这一点。
You know this.

1145
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,472
你说这段视频显示了一个你以前见过的地方。
You said this clip showed a place you'd seen before.

1146
01:10:32,504 --> 01:10:34,207
我要知道在哪里。
I need to know where.

1147
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,075
数据被擦除了，但还在你脑子里。
The data's been erased, but it's in your head.

1148
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:39,711
请试着回忆一下。这真的很重要。
Please try to remember. This is really important.

1149
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:43,216
人,请思考。冰淇淋，秋千?
Please, Guy, think. The ice cream, the swings?

1150
01:10:43,249 --> 01:10:44,716
我的男人喜欢荡秋千。
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

1151
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,718
在自由城市港口公园，那里有一个很棒的秋千。
At Free City Harbor Park, there's a great swing set there.

1152
01:10:46,752 --> 01:10:48,054
-你去过吗?――是的。
- Have you been? - Yes.

1153
01:10:48,087 --> 01:10:49,455
我们吃了泡泡糖冰淇淋。
We had bubble gum ice cream.

1154
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:52,358
我的天，我喜欢泡泡糖冰淇淋!
OMG, I love bubble gum ice cream!

1155
01:10:52,392 --> 01:10:53,826
他喜欢泡泡糖冰淇淋。
He loves the bubble gum ice cream.

1156
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,029
是的,我知道。我们一起经历过，记得吗?
Yes, I know. We had it together, remember?

1157
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,698
求你了，盖伊，你是我的一切。
Please, Guy, you're all I've got.

1158
01:11:03,668 --> 01:11:07,407
对不起,女士。我想你找错人了。
I'm sorry, lady. I think you have the wrong guy.

1159
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,043
没有美好的一天，要有美好的一天。
Don't have a good day, have a great day.

1160
01:11:24,023 --> 01:11:25,058
喂?
Hello?

1161
01:11:25,091 --> 01:11:26,793
我可能有所发现。
I might've found something.

1162
01:11:26,826 --> 01:11:31,663
我一直在检查盖伊的密码直到现在，在清除之后，还有一些东西在里面。
I've been going through Guy's code and there is something there... even now, after the wipe.

1163
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:33,332
有什么意义?
What's the point?

1164
01:11:33,366 --> 01:11:35,634
Guy简直就是个十亿分之一的奇迹。我们无法复制。
Guy was, like, a one-in-a-billion miracle. We can't replicate that.

1165
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,303
我试过了,好吗?你是对的，结束了。
I tried, okay? You were right, it's over.

1166
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:40,106
不，米莉，米莉，你没在听我说话，好吗?
No, Millie, Millie, you're not listening to me, all right?

1167
01:11:40,139 --> 01:11:45,411
重新启动，并不能清除他的人工智能代码...你必须摧毁服务器才能做到这一点。
A reboot, it doesn't erase his AI coding... you literally would have to destroy the servers to do that.

1168
01:11:45,445 --> 01:11:48,047
他的人工智能还在，只是需要被访问。
His AI is still there, it just needs to be accessed.

1169
01:11:48,081 --> 01:11:50,383
我见过他，凯斯。他忘记了一切。
I've seen him, Keys. He's forgotten everything.

1170
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,651
看看我发给你的追踪日志。
Just look at the trace log I sent you.

1171
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,353
它会解释一切。
It'll explain everything.

1172
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,507
现在，由于我们的代码，Guy的行为从一开始就比应该的复杂得多。
Now, from the beginning... Guy's behavior is much more complex than it should be, thanks to our code.

1173
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:18,144
但他还困在自由城。他还困在这个循环里。
But he's still stuck in Free City. He's still stuck in this life, this loop.

1174
01:12:18,177 --> 01:12:22,248
然后，事情发生了变化。他活过来了。为什么?
And then, something changes. He comes to life. Why?

1175
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,550
然后我想起来了。
And then I remembered.

1176
01:12:24,584 --> 01:12:27,854
《生活本身》中的一个角色就是我给他起了个昵称叫“失恋者”。
One of the characters from Life Itself was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.

1177
01:12:27,887 --> 01:12:31,991
他注定永远不会遇到真命天子。
And he was someone who was designed to never meet the right person.

1178
01:12:32,024 --> 01:12:34,327
它本质上是角色的构建模块。
It was essentially the building blocks of the character.

1179
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,662
但他从未停止希望能遇到“他的梦中情人”。
But he never stopped hoping that he would meet "the girl of his dreams."

1180
01:12:38,697 --> 01:12:44,270
所以我得把这个女孩从一个人身上找出来,还有谁比我每天坐在旁边的那个人更好呢?
So I had to base this girl off of someone... and who better than the person that I was sitting next to every day?

1181
01:12:44,303 --> 01:12:45,404
你。
You.

1182
01:12:45,438 --> 01:12:51,110
但有一天，他在自由之城遇见了你，一旦他见到你他就再也回不来了。
But then, one day... he meets you in Free City, and once he sees you... he can never be the same.

1183
01:12:51,144 --> 01:12:57,984
他本应感到命中注定，但相反，他觉得自己还活着，直到最后，他还活着。
He was supposed to feel doomed, but instead, he feels alive... until eventually, he is alive.

1184
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:01,220
你改变了他，米莉。
You changed him, Millie.

1185
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:05,791
你改了他的密码。我觉得你可以再来一次。
You changed his code. And I think you can do it again.

1186
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:08,194
你让他复活了，米莉。
You brought him to life, Millie.

1187
01:13:09,295 --> 01:13:11,230
你让他复活了。
You brought him to life.

1188
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:19,105
他还活着是因为他遇见了那个人…不开心的一天…祝你今天愉快。
And he was alive because he met the one person... Don't have a good day... have a great day.

1189
01:13:19,138 --> 01:13:20,573
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1190
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,108
当心
Take care.

1191
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:23,775
所有人都趴到地上!
Everybody down on the ground!

1192
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:26,345
没人想当英雄。这一切很快就会结束。
Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon.

1193
01:13:26,379 --> 01:13:27,446
好吧。
Okay.

1194
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,115
每个人除了你。
Everybody except you.

1195
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,420
门,门,门。我得到了它。
Door, door, door. I got it.

1196
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:35,754
拜托，我有条金鱼。
Please, I have a goldfish.

1197
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:37,123
听着，我时间不多了。
Look, I don't have long.

1198
01:13:37,156 --> 01:13:39,225
我刚把你当人质，所以我身上有三枚徽章。
I just took you hostage, so there are three badges on me.

1199
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:41,127
徽章?这是女童子军的活动吗?那是什么?
Badges? Is that like a Girl Scout thing? What is that?

1200
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,361
你心里有东西，盖伊。
There is something inside you, Guy.

1201
01:13:42,395 --> 01:13:43,728
什么?我不想让任何东西进入我的身体。
What? I don't want anything inside of me.

1202
01:13:43,762 --> 01:13:46,399
他们把你困在银行里，希望你遵守规则…-我喜欢银行。
They stuck you in that bank and... - expected you to just follow the rules... - I love the bank.

1203
01:13:46,432 --> 01:13:47,567
．..每天做同样的事情。
...and do the same thing every day.

1204
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,634
你远不止如此。
You are so much more than that.

1205
01:13:48,668 --> 01:13:49,768
我不想再多了。
I don't wanna be more than that.

1206
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:51,437
不，我要你记住这一点。
No, and I need you to remember it.

1207
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,705
你为什么跟踪我，你怎么知道我的名字?
Why have you been following me and how do you know my name?

1208
01:13:53,738 --> 01:13:55,007
把这些。
Put these on.

1209
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,342
我不需要做任何我不想做的事。
I don't have to do anything that I don't wanna do.

1210
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:58,743
真实的。选择权在你。
True. The choice is totally yours.

1211
01:13:58,778 --> 01:14:00,580
好吧。好吧。很好。
Okay. Okay. Fine.

1212
01:14:05,351 --> 01:14:07,285
那是什么?
What is that?

1213
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,322
这些是什么?魔术眼镜之类的?
What are these? Trick glasses or something?

1214
01:14:09,355 --> 01:14:10,223
仔细倾听。
Listen carefully.

1215
01:14:10,256 --> 01:14:15,661
24小时后，这个世界，你认识的所有人，都会永远消失。
In 24 hours, this world, everyone you know, it's all gonna disappear for good.

1216
01:14:15,695 --> 01:14:17,163
你能放我走吗?
Can you please just let me go?

1217
01:14:17,196 --> 01:14:18,831
我是说，我都没见过你的脸。
I mean, I haven't really even seen your face.

1218
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:21,933
我是说，我看到了大致的区域，但我不太擅长描述性词汇。
I mean, I've seen the general area, but I'm not really good with descriptive words.

1219
01:14:21,968 --> 01:14:23,502
一般来说不太会说话。
Not really good with words in general.

1220
01:14:24,604 --> 01:14:26,239
――去他的。――什么?哦!
- Screw it. - What? Oh!

1221
01:15:04,277 --> 01:15:05,378
我记得。
I remember.

1222
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:08,414
欢迎回来。
Welcome back.

1223
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:11,417
不。我记得一切。
No. I remember everything.

1224
01:15:12,318 --> 01:15:13,919
跟我来。
Come with me.

1225
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:17,189
我每天都这么做，都忘了为什么了。
I do this every day so much, I'd forgotten why.

1226
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:22,194
看到了吗?
Do you see that?

1227
01:15:22,228 --> 01:15:23,796
在这里。
Right there.

1228
01:15:24,297 --> 01:15:25,831
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

1229
01:15:27,033 --> 01:15:28,567
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

1230
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:35,441
安特万把我们原来的建筑藏在了地平线后面，让它看不见，但他忘了擦去反光。
Antwan hid our original build past the horizon, making it invisible... but he forgot to scrub the reflections.

1231
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:38,311
它还在外面，盖伊。我们只是看不见而已。
It's still out there, Guy. We just can't see it.

1232
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:40,179
如果我们能做到，那就是我们需要的证据。
If we can get there, that is the evidence we need.

1233
01:15:40,212 --> 01:15:43,281
你不能越过水位线。我试过了。
You can't go past the water line. I tried.

1234
01:15:43,316 --> 01:15:45,318
我们需要帮助。
We need help.

1235
01:15:45,351 --> 01:15:49,755
安特万找到了一个办法，把它藏在了一个没人能到达的地方。
Antwan found a way to hide it in plain sight in the one place no one can even get to.

1236
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:51,923
我甚至不敢相信他会聪明到如此邪恶。
I can't even believe he's smart enough to be this diabolical.

1237
01:15:51,957 --> 01:15:53,459
钥匙，我需要你集中精神。
Keys, I need you to focus.

1238
01:15:53,492 --> 01:15:57,163
好吧。所以，反射的图像显示了建筑越过了南部地平线。
Okay. So, the reflection shows the build past the southern horizon.

1239
01:15:57,196 --> 01:15:59,365
但游戏物理原理不允许你通过海滩。
But the game physics won't allow you past the beach.

1240
01:15:59,398 --> 01:16:02,101
但你觉得你有办法让我们穿过碰撞网吗?
But you think you can find a way to get us past the collision mesh?

1241
01:16:02,134 --> 01:16:03,502
我们需要一座桥。
We're gonna need a bridge.

1242
01:16:03,536 --> 01:16:05,705
你先去杀手海滩，剩下的我来解决。
You just get to Hitman's Beach and I'll figure out the rest.

1243
01:16:05,738 --> 01:16:07,106
米莉?
And, Millie?

1244
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:08,809
小心。
Be careful.

1245
01:16:08,841 --> 01:16:10,676
安特万也许是个混蛋，但他不蠢。
Antwan may be an asshole, but he's not stupid.

1246
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:13,646
他会发现你在做什么他会把所有的东西都扔给你。
He'll figure out what you're up to and he'll throw everything he's got at you.

1247
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,214
你是对的。
You're right.

1248
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:19,685
嗨，米莉，还有一个我看不见的人…我有个主意。
Um, hi, Millie, and other person I can't see... well, I have an idea.

1249
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:21,520
如果他没有东西可以扔呢?
What if he has nothing to throw?

1250
01:16:23,222 --> 01:16:26,125
每个人!聚在!
Everyone! Gather around!

1251
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,161
谢谢你的到来。
Thank you for coming.

1252
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,297
你认识我，我是盖伊。
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

1253
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,932
嗨,Guy。
Hi, Guy.

1254
01:16:33,466 --> 01:16:35,134
嗨。
Hi.

1255
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:38,170
我接下来要说的话可能很难理解。
What I'm about to say may be hard to understand.

1256
01:16:38,904 --> 01:16:40,406
真的很难理解。
Really hard to understand.

1257
01:16:42,108 --> 01:16:45,411
但是，你是否厌倦了生活在幕后?
But, are you sick of living in the background?

1258
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,481
你不讨厌被人开枪吗?
Aren't you sick of being shot at?

1259
01:16:48,514 --> 01:16:49,548
足够了。
Enough.

1260
01:16:49,582 --> 01:16:51,117
――被扣为人质?――不再。
- Taken hostage? - No more.

1261
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,485
――运行结束了吗?-我们做完了。
- Run over? - We done with that.

1262
01:16:52,518 --> 01:16:54,887
抢劫吗?刺?用作人肉盾牌?
Robbed? Stabbed? Used as a human shield?

1263
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,522
我们受够了被刺!
We are tired of being stabbed!

1264
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:57,791
――朋友!――对不起。
- Buddy! - Sorry.

1265
01:16:57,824 --> 01:16:59,458
你想说什么，盖伊?
What are you trying to say, Guy?

1266
01:16:59,492 --> 01:17:02,728
我想说的是，在这个城市里，事情不应该是这样的。
I'm tryin' to say that things in this city don't have to be this way.

1267
01:17:02,762 --> 01:17:03,896
事情可能会有所不同。
Things can be different.

1268
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:05,164
不同的如何?
Different how?

1269
01:17:05,197 --> 01:17:08,901
-首先，你可以放下你的手臂。-是的。
- For starters, you can put your arms down. - Yeah.

1270
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:13,406
那就这样吧。你明白了。是的。
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

1271
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:14,974
继续努力。那就这样吧。
Keep pushing. There you go.

1272
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,041
通过它呼吸。那就这样吧。
Breathe through it. There you go.

1273
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:17,176
这样做。这样做。这样做。
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1274
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:18,812
不，不可能。不。
No, not gonna happen. Nope.

1275
01:17:18,845 --> 01:17:20,179
这感觉不自然。
That feels unnatural.

1276
01:17:20,212 --> 01:17:22,481
我是说，如果有人拿着枪跑进来怎么办?
I mean, what about when someone runs in with a gun?

1277
01:17:22,515 --> 01:17:24,885
举起双臂是真正节省时间的方法。
Having my arms up is just a real time saver.

1278
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:29,790
但是，如果带枪的人不来怎么办?
Except, what if the guy with the gun doesn't come?

1279
01:17:29,823 --> 01:17:31,289
――什么?――什么?
- What? - What?

1280
01:17:31,323 --> 01:17:32,758
总有带枪的人。
There's always a guy with a gun.

1281
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:34,660
这么多带枪的人。
So many guys with guns.

1282
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:38,297
各位，如果我们的世界没必要这么恐怖呢?
People, what if our world doesn't have to be so scary?

1283
01:17:39,598 --> 01:17:41,267
如果我们能改变它呢?
What if we can change it?

1284
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:46,505
米莉!在你的世界里，银行一天被抢劫几次?
Millie! How many times a day are the banks robbed in your world?

1285
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:47,740
几乎没有人。
Hardly ever, Guy.

1286
01:17:47,773 --> 01:17:49,941
那尸体呢，米莉?
What about corpses, Millie?

1287
01:17:49,975 --> 01:17:51,076
――什么?-你见过很多吗?
- What? - You see a lot of those?

1288
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:52,678
一小时多少?
How many an hour?

1289
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:54,146
一小时都没有，盖伊。
None per hour, Guy.

1290
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,015
那么枪支暴力呢?
What about gun violence?

1291
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,716
在你的世界里有很多枪支暴力吗?
See a lot of gun violence in your world?

1292
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,287
事实上，这是个大问题，盖伊。这是个大问题。
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy. It's a massive problem.

1293
01:18:03,022 --> 01:18:04,123
我没想到会这样。
I didn't see that coming.

1294
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:06,492
这是真的。这真是糟透了。
It's true. It really sucks.

1295
01:18:06,525 --> 01:18:11,096
重点是，我们不需要成为自己生活的旁观者。
The point is, we don't have to be spectators to our own lives.

1296
01:18:11,832 --> 01:18:13,632
我们想做什么就做什么。
We can be whatever we want.

1297
01:18:13,666 --> 01:18:15,401
我们不可能都是你，盖伊。
We can't all be you, Guy.

1298
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:16,635
那不是真的。
That's not true.

1299
01:18:17,938 --> 01:18:21,273
我体内的东西也在你体内。
What's inside of me is inside of you, too.

1300
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:22,541
什么?
What?

1301
01:18:22,575 --> 01:18:25,244
它就在你们每个人的内心。你成长。
It's inside of each and every one of you. You're growing.

1302
01:18:25,277 --> 01:18:29,748
我需要的不仅仅是滴滤咖啡。我想做…卡布奇诺。
I need more in my life than drip coffee. I want to make... A cappuccino.

1303
01:18:29,783 --> 01:18:31,616
真是天壤之别。
A goddamn difference in the world.

1304
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:32,885
得更好。
Much, much better.

1305
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:33,986
还有一颗绿茶珍珠。
And a green tea boba.

1306
01:18:34,019 --> 01:18:35,789
――天啊!――这是正确的!
- Holy shit! - That's right!

1307
01:18:35,822 --> 01:18:37,255
你走到哪里,女孩。
You go, girl.

1308
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:38,457
天啊，你太棒了!
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

1309
01:18:38,491 --> 01:18:42,428
如果我能游过那片水域,外面就会有一个我们可以自由的世界。
If I could just make it out past that water... there's a world out there where we can be free.

1310
01:18:42,461 --> 01:18:44,563
我们可以决定自己想成为什么样的人。
Where we get to decide who we wanna be.

1311
01:18:44,597 --> 01:18:47,166
我们可以发挥作用。但我们必须为之奋斗。
Where we can matter. But we have to fight for it.

1312
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,068
我们必须一起战斗。
We have to fight together.

1313
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:51,203
是啊!
Yeah!

1314
01:18:51,237 --> 01:18:53,772
你们一直都在做你们该做的事。
You guys have always done what's expected of you.

1315
01:18:53,807 --> 01:18:55,474
但今天就结束了。
But that shit ends today.

1316
01:18:55,508 --> 01:18:56,909
是啊!
Yeah!

1317
01:18:56,943 --> 01:18:58,744
我都不知道现在发生了什么!
I don't even know what's happening right now!

1318
01:18:58,778 --> 01:18:59,813
但我喜欢它!
But I love it!

1319
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:02,748
我爱它!
I love it!

1320
01:19:03,884 --> 01:19:05,050
我爱它!
I love it!

1321
01:19:05,084 --> 01:19:06,853
我也喜欢它!来吧，伙计们，进来!
I love it, too! Come on, guys, get in here!

1322
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:10,022
蜷缩起来!这就是我们要做的!每个人都在!
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do! Everyone in!

1323
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:17,964
所有人趴到地上!
Everybody get down on the ground!

1324
01:19:23,003 --> 01:19:24,236
喂?
Hello?

1325
01:19:25,704 --> 01:19:27,640
所有人都去哪了?
Where the hell is everybody?

1326
01:19:28,507 --> 01:19:30,075
喂?
Hello?

1327
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:42,521
所有的npc在哪里?
Where are all the NPCs?

1328
01:19:50,964 --> 01:19:54,000
听着，我打自由之城已经有三年了。
Look, I've been playing Free City for, like, three years now.

1329
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:56,201
我从来没见过这样的东西。
I've never seen anything like this.

1330
01:19:56,235 --> 01:19:59,705
直到最近，我都不知道自己是否注意到一些npc消失了。
Up until recently, I don't even know if I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing.

1331
01:19:59,738 --> 01:20:06,846
我不知道这是不是一个疯狂的Reddit理论，但有些人说蓝衫男根本就不是玩家。
And I don't know if this is just some whack Reddit theory... but some people are saying that Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.

1332
01:20:06,879 --> 01:20:09,748
-他是真正的人工智能――人工智能?
- That he's actual AI. - AI?

1333
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:13,251
真正的人工智能。你知道,活着。
Actual AI. You know, alive.

1334
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:15,588
所以蓝衫男才会到处流行。
It's why Blue Shirt Guy is trending everywhere.

1335
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,623
安特万，如果你在看这个，请修改游戏。
Antwan, if you're watching this, please fix the game.

1336
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:21,193
-最重要的是，把蓝衬衫带回来。-我的天啊。我的上帝!
- And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt. - Oh, my God. My God!

1337
01:20:21,226 --> 01:20:22,695
安特万，你应该看看这个。
Antwan, you should see this.

1338
01:20:24,798 --> 01:20:28,233
而你，你想用那个叫莫洛托夫的小妞从我这里偷走它。
And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick.

1339
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:29,501
-她叫米莉。――谁?
- Her name's Millie. - Who?

1340
01:20:29,535 --> 01:20:30,502
米莉。
Millie.

1341
01:20:30,536 --> 01:20:33,606
找到她了。找到她了!抓到你了!抓到你了!
Got her. Got her! Got you! Got you!

1342
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:36,375
逮老鼠的!把他放到屏幕上。现在。让他起来。
Mouser! Put him up on the screen. Now. Put him up.

1343
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:38,143
就是这样。来吧,快。
That's it. Come on, quicker.

1344
01:20:38,177 --> 01:20:39,813
是的，他在那儿。
Yes, there he is.

1345
01:20:39,846 --> 01:20:43,549
他和一个叫Molotovgirl的球员在自由城兜风。
He's joyriding around Free City with some player called Molotovgirl.

1346
01:20:44,216 --> 01:20:47,020
又名Millie Rusk。
AKA Millie Rusk.

1347
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:48,754
Millie Rusk?那不是凯斯的老搭档吗?
Millie Rusk? Isn't that Keys' old partner?

1348
01:20:48,788 --> 01:20:49,990
是的。
Yeah.

1349
01:20:50,023 --> 01:20:54,693
还有那个想用这个虚假的诉讼来打击我的人，因为她非常想要关淳美的一部分。
Also the one who's trying to hit me with this bogus lawsuit... 'cause she's desperate for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

1350
01:20:54,727 --> 01:20:56,128
现在启动 Molotovgirl。
Boot Molotovgirl now.

1351
01:20:56,161 --> 01:21:00,366
我尝试。我已经尽力了，但她的账户被骗了。
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I can, but her account's spoofed.

1352
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:01,667
这个女人很特别。
This woman is exceptional.

1353
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,135
然后在游戏里杀了她。
Then kill her in the game.

1354
01:21:03,168 --> 01:21:05,839
“什么?”是的，我说了。杀了她。
"What?" Yes, I said that. Kill her.

1355
01:21:05,872 --> 01:21:09,642
把一切都扔给他们，好吗?5个徽章,G。
Throw everything at them, all right? Five badges, G.

1356
01:21:09,675 --> 01:21:11,310
是的，只有一个问题。
Yeah, just one problem.

1357
01:21:11,343 --> 01:21:12,846
我们什么都没有。
We don't have anything.

1358
01:21:12,879 --> 01:21:14,047
你在说什么，威利斯?
Whatchu talking about, Willis?

1359
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,581
我们没有任何防御措施。
We don't have any defenses.

1360
01:21:15,614 --> 01:21:19,184
我们没有警察，军队，什么都没有。
We don't have police, military, no nothing.

1361
01:21:19,218 --> 01:21:20,954
这就是我一直想告诉你的。
It's what I've been trying to tell you.

1362
01:21:20,987 --> 01:21:24,690
就像每个NPC都在罢工。
It's like every NPC went on strike.

1363
01:21:26,225 --> 01:21:30,262
一大杯，半咖啡，双层泡沫燕麦奶，肉桂抹茶拿铁!
Got a tall, half-caf, double foam oat milk, matcha latte with cinnamon!

1364
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:31,798
――这就是我。-嗨。
- That's me. - Hey.

1365
01:21:31,831 --> 01:21:33,265
――谢谢。――欢迎你。
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1366
01:21:33,298 --> 01:21:34,366
欢呼。
Cheers.

1367
01:21:37,103 --> 01:21:38,838
去抓住他们，盖伊!
Go get 'em, Guy!

1368
01:21:40,406 --> 01:21:42,675
这就像一场数字罢工。
It's like a digital walkout.

1369
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:44,778
不,它不是。
No, it's not.

1370
01:21:44,811 --> 01:21:46,846
他们是故意这么做的，这是他们计划的一部分。
They're doing this on purpose, it's part of their plan.

1371
01:21:46,879 --> 01:21:49,214
你知道我们要做什么吗?我们要在游戏中干掉他们。
You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna kill them in the game.

1372
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:51,283
关掉重生，杀了他们。
Turn off respawn, kill them dead, now.

1373
01:21:51,316 --> 01:21:53,886
但这意味着任何球员的死亡将永远结束。
But that means any players who die will be done for good.

1374
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,354
他们会吓一跳。
They'll freak out.

1375
01:21:57,356 --> 01:21:59,725
我也不在乎
I don't care.

1376
01:21:59,758 --> 01:22:04,329
先生?长官，我想问清楚，你是说该走了吗?
Sir? Sir, just to be clear, are you telling me that it's go time?

1377
01:22:04,363 --> 01:22:08,200
你以为我们现在是朋友，是一伙的，所以你想找点乐子吗?
Are you looking for some sort of banter thing 'cause you think we're friends now... and we're in some sort of gang together?

1378
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:10,268
是的。是的，这正是我想要的。
Yes. Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for.

1379
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,336
很好，我们是一个团队。
Cool, we're a team.

1380
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,605
我们应该想出一个口头语，好吗?――好的。
We should come up - with a catchphrase, okay? - All right.

1381
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:17,509
――数到三。一,二,三……-一，二，三…回去工作!
- On three. One, two, three... - One, two, three... Get back to work!

1382
01:22:18,111 --> 01:22:19,611
谁来帮我找钥匙!
Someone find me Keys!

1383
01:22:24,017 --> 01:22:26,853
好了，大家都听到了。该走了!
All right, people, you heard him. It's go time!

1384
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:33,793
好吧，这可不太好。
Okay, that's not good.

1385
01:22:35,195 --> 01:22:37,130
他知道我们要去哪里。
He knows where we're going.

1386
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:45,138
好的，我抓住他了。我得到了他。别担心。
All right, I got him. I got him. Don't worry.

1387
01:22:45,171 --> 01:22:47,006
想要四只轮子吗?
Want some four wheels to the face?

1388
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,574
接招吧。
Take that. Boom!

1389
01:22:51,778 --> 01:22:54,646
兔子来找你了。顶端捕食者。
Rabbit's coming for you. Apex predator.

1390
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:57,349
哇!
Whoa!

1391
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,960
我们开始吧。你们看这个吗?
Here we go. Y'all watching this?

1392
01:23:06,993 --> 01:23:08,260
我要结束这个傻瓜。
I'm about to end this fool.

1393
01:23:10,395 --> 01:23:12,765
快点，快点，快点。
Come on, come on, come on.

1394
01:23:12,799 --> 01:23:14,901
钥匙，如果你在的话，帮帮忙。
Keys, if you're there, a little help, please.

1395
01:23:26,012 --> 01:23:30,216
上帝!好吧，这是谁干的?谁在做这个?
God! Okay, who did that? Who is doing that?

1396
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:34,220
别跟我玩!认真对待!我的压力太大了!
Don't play with me! Seriously! I'm under way too much pressure!

1397
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:39,793
来吧!
Come on!

1398
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:44,998
走,走,走!
Go, go, go!

1399
01:24:00,612 --> 01:24:02,849
我刚跟保安确认过。钥匙还没离开大楼。
I just checked with security. Keys hasn't left the building.

1400
01:24:02,882 --> 01:24:04,184
听起来你已经尽力了。
Oh, sounds like you've done everything possible.

1401
01:24:04,217 --> 01:24:05,317
是时候放弃了?你想放弃吗?
Time to give up? You wanna give up?

1402
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,318
不，我感觉你想让我继续找。
No, I'm sensing you want me to keep looking.

1403
01:24:06,351 --> 01:24:07,586
――走吧。-我会回来的。
- Go. - I'll be back.

1404
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:10,622
我不知道这些蠢货要去哪。
I have no idea where these fools are running to.

1405
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:14,227
我做的事。南部海岸。杀手海滩。
I do. Southern shore. Hitman's Beach.

1406
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,628
嗯,那是愚蠢的。那里除了水什么都没有。
Well, that's stupid. There's nothing out there but water.

1407
01:24:16,662 --> 01:24:19,531
游戏物理甚至不让你通过海岸线。
Game physics won't even let you get past the shoreline.

1408
01:24:21,134 --> 01:24:23,335
除非外面有什么东西。
Unless there is something out there.

1409
01:24:24,369 --> 01:24:26,338
安特万，有什么事吗?
Antwan, is there something there?

1410
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:29,775
去他的  艺术狂
Screw it. Art nerds.

1411
01:24:29,809 --> 01:24:31,144
伙计，时间到了。
Time for Dude.

1412
01:24:31,177 --> 01:24:32,312
我们还在调查他。
We're still working on him.

1413
01:24:32,344 --> 01:24:34,746
我亲自给他做的。他是完美的。
I worked on him myself. He's perfect.

1414
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:36,850
快来吧，伙计。
Drop in Dude now.

1415
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:42,055
想做就做。他的脑子都快写不出来了，不过可以上传了。
Just do it. He's got, like, half a brain... he's barely written, but sure, start the upload.

1416
01:24:49,594 --> 01:24:50,762
我们现在该怎么办?
What are we supposed to do now?

1417
01:24:50,797 --> 01:24:54,000
现在凯斯帮我们找到了一座桥。
Now Keys finds us a bridge.

1418
01:24:54,033 --> 01:24:57,103
是来收你捅在我背后的刀子的吗，兄弟?
Come to collect those knives you stabbed in my back, bro?

1419
01:24:58,805 --> 01:25:00,672
你一直在帮米莉・拉斯克。
You've been helping Millie Rusk this whole time.

1420
01:25:00,706 --> 01:25:02,275
她在找你的身材。
She's looking for your build.

1421
01:25:02,308 --> 01:25:04,077
Antwan,构建什么?
What build, Antwan?

1422
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:05,845
反正你也没用我们的代码，对吧?
It's not like you used our code anyway, right?

1423
01:25:05,878 --> 01:25:10,549
如果你没有使用我们的代码，那么我们的原始构建又怎么可能出现在游戏中呢?
And if you didn't use our code... then how can our original build be in the game, right?

1424
01:25:10,582 --> 01:25:12,684
还是我遗漏了什么?
Or am I missing something?

1425
01:25:14,386 --> 01:25:15,587
离开我们。
Leave us.

1426
01:25:18,858 --> 01:25:22,527
好了，凯斯，我们好好谈谈。
Okay, Keys, let's have a real talk.

1427
01:25:22,561 --> 01:25:25,464
如果我把你的烂游戏发布出去，肯定会失败。
If I'd put out your dumb game, it would have bombed.

1428
01:25:25,497 --> 01:25:26,933
安特万，你不知道会失败。
Antwan, you don't know it would've failed.

1429
01:25:26,966 --> 01:25:28,134
是的，我知道。
Yeah, I do know.

1430
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:31,004
我看了那些数字，追踪记录，焦点小组。
I looked at the numbers, the tracking, the focus groups.

1431
01:25:31,037 --> 01:25:34,841
你有没有想过有些东西比数字更重要?
Has it ever occurred to you that some things matter more than numbers?

1432
01:25:34,874 --> 01:25:37,509
有什么比数字更重要?钱吗?
What matters more than numbers? Money?

1433
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:40,380
告诉你，兄弟，钱还是数字。
Yo, news flash, bro, money is still numbers.

1434
01:25:40,412 --> 01:25:41,981
没有什么比数字更重要!
Nothing matters more than numbers!

1435
01:25:42,015 --> 01:25:43,415
你应该感谢我!
You should be thanking me!

1436
01:25:43,448 --> 01:25:44,716
我应该感谢你吗?
I should be thanking you?

1437
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,886
那你从我们工作中得到的利润呢?
What about the profits that you got from our work?

1438
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,055
你选择了你的阵营，小徒弟。
You chose your side, little Padawan.

1439
01:25:49,088 --> 01:25:52,959
现在，是时候让你登上皇帝的宝座了。
And now, it's time for you to take your place next to the Emperor.

1440
01:25:52,992 --> 01:25:53,993
你懂我的意思吗，兄弟?
You get me, bro?

1441
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:58,197
是啊，我懂你…兄弟。
Yeah, I get you... bro.

1442
01:25:58,231 --> 01:26:00,766
这让我想到了这个。
Which leads me to this.

1443
01:26:15,982 --> 01:26:17,183
谢谢,钥匙。
Thanks, Keys.

1444
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,890
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

1445
01:26:23,923 --> 01:26:26,625
安特万，事情越来越忙了。
Hey, Antwan, things are getting hectic.

1446
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:32,531
我以为你不会这么傻的，凯斯。
Oh, I thought you were smarter than this, Keys.

1447
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:34,766
你显然被解雇了，你知道的。
You're obviously fired, you know that.

1448
01:26:34,801 --> 01:26:38,037
还有你，她为什么还在游戏里?
And you, what is she still doing in the game, man?

1449
01:26:38,071 --> 01:26:38,972
把每个人都踢出去。
Boot everyone.

1450
01:26:39,005 --> 01:26:41,374
等等。你想让我踢走所有玩家吗?
Hold up. You want me to boot all the players?

1451
01:26:41,407 --> 01:26:43,309
把他们踢出比赛，快!
Boot them out of the game, now!

1452
01:26:43,343 --> 01:26:45,078
取消所有玩家账号!
Cancel every player account!

1453
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:46,779
那老哥到底在哪里?
And where the hell is Dude?

1454
01:26:46,813 --> 01:26:49,782
安全!把这家伙踢出去。
Security! Kick this punk out.

1455
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,621
Guy!
Guy!

1456
01:26:56,655 --> 01:26:58,523
――米莉!-他们要带我出去。
- Millie! - They're taking me out.

1457
01:26:58,557 --> 01:26:59,993
发生什么事情了?
What's happening?

1458
01:27:00,026 --> 01:27:00,960
现在全靠你了。大家都在看。
It's on you now. Everybody's watching.

1459
01:27:00,994 --> 01:27:02,028
你必须继续前进。
You gotta keep going.

1460
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:04,563
等等,等等,等等!我会再见到你吗?
Wait, wait, wait! Will I see you again?

1461
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:06,232
如果你能过那座桥，你就能。
You will if you make it across that bridge.

1462
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:08,533
向全世界展示我们的建筑。这就是证据。
Show the whole world our build. That's the proof.

1463
01:27:08,567 --> 01:27:11,037
你这么做，安特万就完了。
You do that, Antwan is done.

1464
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,071
我会成功的。
I'll make it.

1465
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:17,176
我会成功的。
I'll make it.

1466
01:27:18,311 --> 01:27:19,511
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell?

1467
01:27:21,147 --> 01:27:22,748
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

1468
01:28:02,188 --> 01:28:06,625
好吧，让我们都记住这一刻，在我们被解雇之前。
All right, let's all remember this moment, before we were fired.

1469
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,428
哦!
Oh!

1470
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:09,862
哇。
Wow.

1471
01:28:14,934 --> 01:28:16,102
标语。
Catchphrase.

1472
01:28:16,135 --> 01:28:17,769
标语吗?
Catchphrase?

1473
01:28:17,804 --> 01:28:19,338
什么?我还没有时间想出一个。
What? I haven't had time to think one up yet.

1474
01:28:19,372 --> 01:28:23,176
虽然“口头禅”作为口头禅是一个相当酷的口头禅。
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase is a pretty cool catchphrase.

1475
01:28:27,346 --> 01:28:28,713
哇。
Whoa.

1476
01:28:29,748 --> 01:28:32,919
起床,Guy。起床了。
Get up, Guy. Get up.

1477
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:47,300
哦，不，不，不。
Oh, no, no, no.

1478
01:28:51,603 --> 01:28:54,874
盖伊，我是来救你的。
Guy, I came to save you.

1479
01:28:56,775 --> 01:28:59,145
-你是谁?-我不知道。
- Who is this? - I don't know.

1480
01:28:59,178 --> 01:29:00,346
他是光荣的。
He's glorious.

1481
01:29:01,948 --> 01:29:05,017
我是说，他和你一样，但要好得多。
I mean, he's just like you... but way better.

1482
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,955
好多了。
Way, way better.

1483
01:29:08,988 --> 01:29:10,857
――谢谢。-不，那不是恭维。
- Thank you. - No, that's not a compliment.

1484
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:12,258
我要是你就不会碰他，巴迪。
I wouldn't touch him if I were you, Buddy.

1485
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:13,758
你说我不该碰他是什么意思?
What do you mean you don't think I should touch him?

1486
01:29:13,793 --> 01:29:15,361
你不介意吧?
You don't mind this, do you?

1487
01:29:15,394 --> 01:29:17,330
因为我也是你的朋友。
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

1488
01:29:21,033 --> 01:29:23,469
我想他会打你的。
Yeah, I think he's gonna... hit you.

1489
01:29:23,503 --> 01:29:24,570
他出拳很用力。
He punches so hard.

1490
01:29:24,604 --> 01:29:25,704
但他的手是那么柔软。
But yet his hands are so soft.

1491
01:29:25,737 --> 01:29:27,140
――坚强。――好吧,再见。
- Be strong. - Okay, bye.

1492
01:29:27,173 --> 01:29:29,408
我对他来说就像羽毛一样。
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

1493
01:29:29,442 --> 01:29:31,077
哟!
Whee!

1494
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:32,478
哈哈!
Ha-ha!

1495
01:29:35,548 --> 01:29:36,883
哦……
Oh...

1496
01:29:40,419 --> 01:29:42,788
不,不,不!不!
No, no, no! No!

1497
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:45,657
起来，盖伊，起来!
Get up, Guy, get up!

1498
01:29:46,325 --> 01:29:47,692
游戏时间结束了。标语。
Playtime's over. Catchphrase.

1499
01:29:47,726 --> 01:29:48,928
我不知道那是什么意思。
I don't know what that means.

1500
01:29:51,531 --> 01:29:53,099
来吧,男人。起来!
Come on, man. Get up!

1501
01:29:53,132 --> 01:29:54,133
起床了。
Get up.

1502
01:29:55,234 --> 01:29:58,004
我一生爱三件事。
There are three things I love in life.

1503
01:29:58,037 --> 01:30:02,808
厉害，待定，第三件事。
Kickin' ass, TBD, third thing here.

1504
01:30:06,812 --> 01:30:08,981
噢！哦，妈的!
Oof! Oh, shit!

1505
01:30:10,682 --> 01:30:12,351
激活致命一击。
Activate death blow.

1506
01:30:12,385 --> 01:30:13,386
再见,Guy。
Bye, Guy.

1507
01:30:18,024 --> 01:30:20,126
哦，该死，这是致命的一击。
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

1508
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,095
起来!
Get up!

1509
01:30:23,129 --> 01:30:25,898
妈妈他来了致命一击
Mom, he's coming in with a death blow!

1510
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:29,969
起床,Guy。
Get up, Guy.

1511
01:30:36,008 --> 01:30:37,076
哦。
Oh.

1512
01:30:39,078 --> 01:30:40,913
什么狗屎?
What the shit?

1513
01:30:48,354 --> 01:30:49,754
这是毒品。
That was dope.

1514
01:31:05,805 --> 01:31:10,742
――等等。是……-这是一个…是的!那是光剑，伙计。
- Hold on. Is that... - That's a... Yes! That's a lightsaber, Dude.

1515
01:31:10,775 --> 01:31:12,311
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

1516
01:31:16,983 --> 01:31:19,118
-那是光剑吗?――这是。
- Is that a lightsaber? - It is.

1517
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:56,022
哦!
Oh!

1518
01:32:02,428 --> 01:32:03,529
Guy!
Guy!

1519
01:32:05,431 --> 01:32:06,932
是的!
Yes!

1520
01:32:06,966 --> 01:32:09,769
是的!这是正确的。起床,Guy。来吧。
Yes! That's right. Get up, Guy. Come on.

1521
01:32:30,489 --> 01:32:31,490
那就这样吧。
There you go.

1522
01:32:32,224 --> 01:32:34,293
你现在看到他们了吗?是吗?
Do you see them all now? Yeah?

1523
01:32:34,327 --> 01:32:35,661
――嗯。――是吗?
- Uh-huh. - Yeah?

1524
01:32:35,695 --> 01:32:38,564
是的，到处都是闪亮的东西。
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

1525
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:41,634
对，就是这样。去得到它。
Yeah, there you go. Go get it.

1526
01:32:41,667 --> 01:32:43,736
只有很多小点心。
Just lots of little snacks.

1527
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:50,743
对，不是跳舞的。不。
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

1528
01:32:50,776 --> 01:32:52,578
自由奔跑，让我更好。
Run free, better me.

1529
01:32:53,814 --> 01:32:55,247
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1530
01:32:55,281 --> 01:32:56,749
我们要去哪里?
Where are we going?

1531
01:32:56,783 --> 01:32:58,785
我们不能让他们过桥。
We can't let them get across that bridge.

1532
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:00,553
你想和我一起结束吗?
You wanna finish this out with me?

1533
01:33:00,585 --> 01:33:03,790
听着，我甚至不知道发生了什么，但我当然支持你。
Look, I don't even know what's going on, but hell yes, I'm with you.

1534
01:33:03,824 --> 01:33:05,558
哈哈!
Ha-ha!

1535
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,360
我们走吧!
Let's go!

1536
01:33:32,451 --> 01:33:33,753
安特万，别这样，伙计。
Antwan, come on, man.

1537
01:33:33,787 --> 01:33:36,254
我们在这里做什么?
What are we doing here?

1538
01:33:37,189 --> 01:33:38,891
Free City 1的服务器在哪里?
Where are the servers to Free City 1?

1539
01:33:38,924 --> 01:33:42,061
不。安特万，你到底在干什么?
No. Antwan, what the hell are you doing?

1540
01:33:42,094 --> 01:33:45,799
如果他们越过地平线到达大楼，我就一无所有了!
If they get past that horizon to the build, I lose everything!

1541
01:33:45,832 --> 01:33:47,233
等等，所以你确实偷了他们的代码。
Wait, so you did steal their code.

1542
01:33:47,265 --> 01:33:49,803
欢迎加入我们的谈话，天才。
Welcome to the conversation, genius.

1543
01:33:49,836 --> 01:33:51,504
现在，那些服务器在哪里?
Now, where are those servers?

1544
01:33:51,537 --> 01:33:53,072
都是这些，但等一下。我在试着理清头绪。
It's all of these, but hold on. I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

1545
01:33:53,105 --> 01:33:54,540
所有这些吗?这一个吗?这一个?
All these? This one? Right, this one?

1546
01:33:54,573 --> 01:33:55,941
是的。你是怎么……
Yeah. How did you...

1547
01:34:02,348 --> 01:34:03,349
运行。
Run.

1548
01:34:08,187 --> 01:34:09,188
Antwan !
Antwan!

1549
01:34:19,498 --> 01:34:20,533
停!
Stop!

1550
01:34:23,536 --> 01:34:24,838
官约翰尼!
Officer Johnny!

1551
01:34:24,871 --> 01:34:26,272
――加油!――加油!
- Come on! - Come on!

1552
01:34:29,341 --> 01:34:32,011
哪个服务器有海洋和桥的其余部分?
Which server has the ocean and the rest of the bridge?

1553
01:34:32,044 --> 01:34:33,112
我不会告诉你的。
I'm not gonna tell you.

1554
01:34:33,145 --> 01:34:34,213
你会毁了它的。
You're just gonna destroy it.

1555
01:34:34,246 --> 01:34:35,748
是的。因为这是我的游戏。
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

1556
01:34:35,782 --> 01:34:39,084
除了它不是。这是钥匙的游戏。
Except it's not. It's Keys' game.

1557
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:40,821
你什么都没做。
You didn't do shit.

1558
01:34:40,854 --> 01:34:43,989
你猜怎么着?钥匙是我的孩子。
And guess what? Keys is my boy.

1559
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:45,458

请把这位前雇员带走。

他可以叫你的真名。

1562
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:12,017
Guy!
Guy!

1563
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:13,954
――朋友!好友!――不,不!继续前进!
- Buddy! Buddy! - No, no! Keep going!

1564
01:35:13,986 --> 01:35:15,956
没有我!
Go without me!

1565
01:35:15,988 --> 01:35:18,224
我这一生都在害怕。
I've been scared my whole damn life.

1566
01:35:19,725 --> 01:35:21,660
但我不再害怕了。

1567
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:26,165
我很抱歉。

1568
01:35:26,765 --> 01:35:28,167

这是我一生中最美好的一天。

你到达了那个建筑。

你让他们知道我们很重要。

那个保安真是个英雄。

你做到了!

1574
01:37:40,165 --> 01:37:41,935
是的!是的!
Yes! Yes!

1575
01:37:41,968 --> 01:37:44,436
吮吸它,Antwan !哇!
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

1576
01:37:45,872 --> 01:37:47,439
Antwan,停止!
Antwan, stop!

1577
01:37:48,108 --> 01:37:49,508
这是结束了。
It's over.

1578
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:53,312
他做到了。

1579
01:37:53,345 --> 01:37:57,316
让所有人都能看到你的游戏的原始结构。
Got your game's original build out there for everyone to see.

1580
01:37:57,349 --> 01:37:59,218
很可能打赢官司，对吧?
Probably win your lawsuit, huh?

1581
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:00,887
看起来可能。
Looks likely.

1582
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,388
酷。
Cool.

1583
01:38:02,421 --> 01:38:06,291
事情是这样的，兄弟。事情是这样的。
And here's the thing, bro. Here's the thing.

1584
01:38:06,325 --> 01:38:09,062
就在这里，我有你在乎的一切。

The sliver that's left of Free City, all your little background friends... including your digital boyfriend.

1586
01:38:16,635 --> 01:38:18,570
最后一个服务器。
Last server.

1587
01:38:18,603 --> 01:38:23,876
听着，我只想要我建立的世界和里面的人。
Look, I just want the world that I built and the people in it.

1588
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:25,544
安特万有什么好处?
What's in it for Antwan?

1589
01:38:25,577 --> 01:38:26,780
其他的一切。
Everything else.

1590
01:38:26,813 --> 01:38:28,613
的意思吗?假装我是愚蠢的。
Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb.

1591
01:38:28,647 --> 01:38:33,218
你有权使用我们的代码，保留所有利润...只要把自由之城剩下的东西给我就行了。
You have the rights to our code, keep all the profits... just give me what's left of Free City.

1592
01:38:33,251 --> 01:38:35,253
让我从那里建立我自己的世界。
Let me build my own world from there.

1593
01:38:35,287 --> 01:38:39,125
自由之城2怎么样?  自由城3 ?
What about Free City 2? Free City 3?

1594
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:40,659
所有的附属产品呢?
And all pursuant spin-offs?

1595
01:38:40,693 --> 01:38:43,762
所有你的。把斧头放下。
All yours. Just put down the axe.

1596
01:38:43,797 --> 01:38:48,901
你知道这是愚蠢交易史上最愚蠢的交易，对吧?
You know that this is, like, the dumbest deal in the history of dumb deals, right?

1597
01:38:48,935 --> 01:38:51,336
我是说，你说的是要放弃数百万美元。
I mean, you're talking about giving up millions of dollars.

1598
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:53,439
为什么会有人这么做?
Why would anyone do that?

1599
01:38:53,472 --> 01:38:55,842
因为凯斯和我做了很棒的东西。
'Cause Keys and I made something great.

1600
01:38:57,877 --> 01:39:00,980
我不需要金钱或名誉来证明这一点。
And I don't need money or fame to prove that to myself.

1601
01:39:01,014 --> 01:39:03,950
我受够了你的游戏，安特万。
I'm done playing your game, Antwan.

1602
01:39:06,186 --> 01:39:08,487
是时候玩我的了。
It's time I played mine.

1603
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:10,857
交易吗?
Deal?

1604
01:39:19,899 --> 01:39:22,202
今天跳得不太好。
Popping today and not in a good way.

1605
01:39:22,267 --> 01:39:29,175
《Free City 2》的销量继续下滑，因为有大量关于代码漏洞和滞后在线体验的报告。
Sales for Free City 2 continue to slip... with numerous reports of bugs in the code and lagging online play.

1606
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:32,979
四面楚歌的Soonami游戏创始人Antwan Hovachelik发现自己被瞄准了。
Embattled Soonami game founder Antwan Hovachelik finds himself in the crosshairs.

1607
01:39:33,012 --> 01:39:34,379
克罗斯。
Crosshairs.

1608
01:39:34,413 --> 01:39:36,215
他被瞄准了，四面楚歌。
He's in the crosshairs and embattled.

1609
01:39:36,248 --> 01:39:37,649
我们太忙了，没有时间幸灾乐祸。
We're too busy to gloat.

1610
01:39:37,683 --> 01:39:39,551
我是一个受害者!我是一个受害者!
I'm a victim! I'm a victim!

1611
01:39:39,584 --> 01:39:43,756
说到忙，我们刚刚把独立访客数量翻了一倍。
Speaking of busy, we just doubled the amount of unique visitors we can handle.

1612
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,690
这是惊人的。
It's amazing.

1613
01:39:44,723 --> 01:39:49,461
谁能想到这么多人只是想看电子游戏中的角色，而不是朝他们开枪?
Who'd have thought that so many people... would just wanna watch video game characters instead of shoot at them?

1614
01:39:49,929 --> 01:39:52,966
嗯…哦，是的，我们做到了。
Hmm... Oh, yeah, we did.

1615
01:39:52,999 --> 01:39:54,767
是的。
Yeah.

1616
01:39:55,802 --> 01:39:58,737
知道吗，你吹牛的时候挺可爱的。
You know, you're pretty cute when you brag.

1617
01:39:58,771 --> 01:39:59,839
Antwan出来!
Antwan out!

1618
01:39:59,873 --> 01:40:04,110
与此同时，《Free Life》也迅速成为小型独立游戏。
Meanwhile, the game Free Life is quickly becoming the little indie that could.

1619
01:40:04,144 --> 01:40:14,120
玩家蜂拥至这款观察性的鱼缸游戏中，他们与唯一的蓝衫男和平互动，现在不再是背景中的数字朋友。
Players are swarming to this observational, fishbowl game... where they interact peacefully with the one and only Blue Shirt Guy... and is now no longer in the background, a digital friend.

1620
01:40:14,154 --> 01:40:15,354
哦,嗨,米尔斯…
Uh, hey, Mills...

1621
01:40:17,523 --> 01:40:19,959
你想和我一起去喝杯咖啡吗?
Do you wanna come grab a coffee with me?

1622
01:40:19,993 --> 01:40:22,494
事实上，我要回到游戏中去了。
Actually, I'm gonna jump back into the game.

1623
01:40:24,164 --> 01:40:26,532
――哦。――咖啡吗?
- Oh. - Coffee?

1624
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:29,002
好吧。是的。听起来不错。
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

1625
01:40:29,035 --> 01:40:30,602
我去给你拿一杯。
I'll just, uh, grab you one.

1626
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:33,940
哦,钥匙,嗯…我知道，中杯咖啡，奶油，两块糖。
Oh, Keys, uh... I know, medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

1627
01:40:33,973 --> 01:40:35,008

Yeah.

1628
01:40:45,218 --> 01:40:47,619
兰迪,你好。弥尔顿。
Hi, Randy. Milton.

1629
01:40:50,023 --> 01:40:51,757
嗯。
Hmm.

1630
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:53,458
我还在想什么时候能再见到你。
I was wondering when I'd see you again.

1631
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,230
是啊，最近的生活太疯狂了。
Yeah, life has been pretty crazy lately.

1632
01:40:57,263 --> 01:40:58,497
你应该看看这里。
You should see it in here.

1633
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:00,900
我们说的是终身免费的泡泡糖冰淇淋。
We're talkin' free bubble gum ice cream for life.

1634
01:41:00,934 --> 01:41:02,701
哇。
Wow.

1635
01:41:05,104 --> 01:41:06,105
嘿,伙计们。
Hey, guys.

1636
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:20,485
看,Guy…这比我想象的难多了。
Look, Guy... Wow, this is harder than I thought.

1637
01:41:21,087 --> 01:41:22,822
那就让我来帮你吧。
Then let me do it for you.

1638
01:41:23,655 --> 01:41:25,091
Guy……
Guy...

1639
01:41:27,759 --> 01:41:31,097
你是梦幻。
you are dreamy.

1640
01:41:32,631 --> 01:41:41,506
你对蓝色衬衫和五个八度音乐巨星的品味…深深地吸引着我。
Your taste in blue shirts and five-octave musical superstars... it's deeply, deeply attractive to me.

1641
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:44,077
但我不能一直和你在一起。
But I can't keep spending all my time with you.

1642
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:49,448
我创造了这个世界，但我不能在其中生活。
I created this world, but I can't live my life in it.

1643
01:41:53,987 --> 01:41:56,555
看到了吗?有那么难吗?
See? Was that so hard?

1644
01:41:57,422 --> 01:41:59,491
那你打算怎么办?
So, what are you gonna do?

1645
01:42:00,293 --> 01:42:02,996
任何我想要的。多亏了你。
Anything I want. Thanks to you.

1646
01:42:04,297 --> 01:42:06,032
我不再困在一个循环里了。
I'm not stuck in a loop anymore.

1647
01:42:06,065 --> 01:42:07,666
也不是你。
Neither are you.

1648
01:42:09,969 --> 01:42:12,638
我爱你，米莉。
I love you, Millie.

1649
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:16,109
也许是我的程序在说话，但你猜怎么着?
Maybe that is my programming talking, but guess what?

1650
01:42:17,409 --> 01:42:19,779
有人写了那个程序。
Someone wrote that program.

1651
01:42:21,747 --> 01:42:23,983
我只是一封写给你的情书。
I'm just a love letter to you.

1652
01:42:24,817 --> 01:42:27,552
作者就在某处。
Somewhere out there is the author.

1653
01:42:45,271 --> 01:42:49,175
你让他复活了。你让他复活了。
You brought him to life. You brought him to life.

1654
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:53,246
他还活着是因为他遇到了他一生都在等待的人。
And he was alive because he met the one person he'd been waiting for his whole life.

1655
01:42:53,279 --> 01:43:02,554
我得让它更真实，所以我以你为原型。
And I had to make it realistic, so... I based it off of... you.

1656
01:43:04,489 --> 01:43:06,625
他的梦中情人……
The woman of his dreams...

1657
01:43:09,262 --> 01:43:10,964
和我的一样。
she was the same as mine.

1658
01:43:10,997 --> 01:43:22,008
她喜欢泡泡糖，冰淇淋和秋千，她有一个非常可爱但很特别的习惯...总是哼唱玛利亚・凯莉的经典歌曲。
So she liked bubble gum ice cream and swing sets... and she had this very cute but oddly specific habit... of always humming this classic Mariah Carey track.

1659
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:25,477
她会一直重复。
Like, all the time, she would... repeat.

1660
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,681
终于!
Finally!

1661
01:43:36,322 --> 01:43:37,522
键!
Keys!

1662
01:43:45,497 --> 01:43:47,233
什么是你…
What are you...

1663
01:44:28,174 --> 01:44:30,043
你没事吧，小家伙Guy?
You okay, little guy Guy?

1664
01:44:30,076 --> 01:44:31,811
你看起来像个形容词。
You seem adjective.

1665
01:44:31,844 --> 01:44:34,646
我很好。我很好。顺便说一句，你可以把我放下来。
I'm great. I'm great. You could put me down, by the way.

1666
01:44:34,679 --> 01:44:36,516
谢谢你！这是好。
Thank you. That was nice.

1667
01:44:36,548 --> 01:44:40,119
不,我很好。你是伟大的,伙计。
No, I'm great. You're great, Dude.

1668
01:44:41,521 --> 01:44:43,456
我只是想念我最好的朋友。
I just miss my best friend.

1669
01:44:44,824 --> 01:44:47,927
我们以前每天都一起走同样的路。
We used to do the same walk together every day.

1670
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,497
只不过他穿了件衬衫。并能完成一个完整的句子。
Except he wore a shirt. And could complete a full sentence.

1671
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:53,132
我可以卧推一个句子。
I can bench press a sentence.

1672
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:56,836
是啊，这完全不是一回事。
Yeah, that's totally not the same thing at all.

1673
01:44:56,869 --> 01:44:59,138
笑得更厉害了!
Harder laughter!

1674
01:44:59,906 --> 01:45:02,108
哦……Guy?
Oh... Guy?

1675
01:45:04,676 --> 01:45:06,645
――朋友!――不!
- Buddy! - No!

1676
01:45:06,678 --> 01:45:07,914
哦,我的上帝!Guy!
Oh, my God! Guy!

1677
01:45:07,947 --> 01:45:09,515
好友!我以为我失去你了!
Buddy! I thought I'd lost you!

1678
01:45:09,549 --> 01:45:10,883
你没有!
You didn't!

1679
01:45:10,917 --> 01:45:15,253
前一分钟，我还在一座疯狂的桥上跑着，想我平淡的生活已经结束了。
One minute, I'm running on a crazy bridge to nowhere... thinkin' my sweet mundane life is over.

1680
01:45:15,288 --> 01:45:24,330
下一分钟，我就像在某种飞行，像是仙尘，仙尘，然后我扑通一声落进了这片天堂。
The next minute, I'm like in some type of flyin'... and some like fairy dust, pixie dust... and then I plopped down into this slice of heaven.

1681
01:45:24,363 --> 01:45:26,933
伙计，我喜欢这里。
Man, I love it here.

1682
01:45:26,966 --> 01:45:29,502
事实上，几天前，我骑过一匹半人马。
In fact, a couple of days ago, I rode a centaur.

1683
01:45:29,535 --> 01:45:36,675
听起来可能有点奇怪,我骑了一个半人半马的人,不管半人马是什么，我做到了。
Now, it might sound weird... I took a piggyback ride on a half-dude and a half-horse... whatever a centaur is, I did it.

1684
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:38,244
我也骑过一个家伙!
I rode a dude, too!

1685
01:45:38,276 --> 01:45:39,545
友好的姿态!
Friendly gesture!

1686
01:45:39,579 --> 01:45:41,247
那么友好!
So friendly!

1687
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:42,681
快，把它拿进来!
Come on, bring it in!

1688
01:45:42,714 --> 01:45:44,050
-我们要拥抱吗?-我来找你!
