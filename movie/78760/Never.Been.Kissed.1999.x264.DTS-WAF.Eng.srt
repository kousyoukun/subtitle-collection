1
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,830
(Catch a Falling Star
by Block playing)

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,073
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

3
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,833
Never let it fade away!

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,550
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

5
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,473
(woman) You know
how some movies have
a dream sequence,

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,438
only they don't
tell you it's a dream?

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,353
This is so not a dream.

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,318
It wasn't
supposed to be like this.

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,237
I was just
trying to do my job,
and then things happened.

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,197
My life happened.

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,311
And now I'm here.

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,628
Trust me,
I'm not the kind of girl
who does things like this.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,710
Two months ago,
you couldn't have picked me
out of a crowd.

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,869
Hi. Call me.

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,555
Told you. I'm over there.

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,992
I was the youngest copy editor
at the Chicago Sun-Times.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,149
Josie.
Hello.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,434
"Theater"?

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,272
Standard American
calls for E-R.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,875
Standard British, R-E.
So, unless you're

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,513
a pompous American,
I would go with E-R.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,195
I had my own office,
unlimited stationery supplies

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,236
and a dedicated assistant.

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,197
How about this
awesome new phrase,

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,113
"Power is powerful."
Total T -shirt, right?

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,155
Amazing. what?

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,229
Can I get my messages?

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,389
Yeah.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,517
Hey, seriously,
last time I saw you,
did I look fat?

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,194
OK, you hesitated.
No, it's case-closed.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,716
Excuse me, Merkin,
there aren't any index cards,

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,472
so I can't do my notes...

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,633
Hey, hey,
hey, Merkin ain't jerkin'.
He's workin'. OK?

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,393
Take that to the bank.
It's power, baby.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,676
Yeah, my boss.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,197
I'm just a little tense.
This office is not feng shui.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,317
All the desks are facing,
like, evil, you know?

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,153
Do you think
I should bleach my teeth?

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,639
Some sunshine
around the mouth?

40
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,759
Or maybe I should
just laser my gums.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,590
Josie! Guess who I
did it with last night.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,159
Roger from Op-Ed?

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,832
Ah! who told you?

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,797
You said yesterday,

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,270
"I have a date with
Roger from Op-Ed tonight,

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,311
"and I'm gonna do it
with him."

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,153
Septuplet story.
I need it by five.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,349
Hopefully,
the copy's not a mess.

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,672
"It's hoped that
it's not a mess."
"Hopefully" means "with hope".

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,591
You have it
defining the copy, and I'm

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,035
pretty sure the copy
doesn't have feelings.

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,348
Hm.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,269
So, Anita,
you and Roger in Op-Ed.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,349
Oh, man, who told you?

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,873
Roger.
Really?

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,554
Don't make me
send you another memo

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,517
about my policy on
interoffice dating.

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,670
It's intra-office dating.

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,638
And they're not dating.
They're having sex.

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,399
Oh.

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,914
And what exactly is
your policy, Augustus?

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,515
That if you're
not getting any,
then no one can? Hm.

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,679
How many times
have I fired her?
Five or six.

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,111
Eight.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,232
Gus,
did you get those story ideas
that I left on your desk?

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,437
Morning, Mr. Strauss.
The blind foster-home mother.

67
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,670
That was good.
I got Cahoon on it.

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,716
Oh, yeah, Cahoon. He's good.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,679
Geller,
we've been through this.
You're a great copy editor.

70
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,274
Maybe my best copy editor.
You're not a reporter.

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,955
You've used five of my ideas.
Gus, please.

72
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,235
Everyone thinks he can write,

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,835
but a journalist
gets in there, where the
bombs are falling.

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,077
He's aggressive.
He grabs
the bull by the balls.

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,276
You don't think I can
grab a bull's balls?

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,478
You don't want
a reporter's life.
Trust me. They're very messy.

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,393
And you're all
about order and control

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,755
and getting me
my copy by five.

79
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,673
I can be out of control.

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,315
Copy by five!

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,473
Josie, maybe Gus has a point.

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,791
It's not gonna kill you
to relax and have some fun.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,111
Hey, Roger's got this friend,
Marshall, in editing.

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,668
Maybe we could all
go on a double date.

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,956
Marshall, "the Duke"?

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,792
I swear to God,
Josie, come on.

87
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,872
Tell me, when is the last time
you went on a real date?

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,230
I'm concentrating
on my career now.

89
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,750
Do you own any
colored underwear?
Stripes or anything?

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,792
The right guy's out there.
I'm just not gonna

91
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,997
go kiss a whole bunch
of losers to get to him.

92
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,789
Yeah, but sometimes
kissing the losers
can be a really fun diversion.

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,399
Mm-hm!

94
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,995
when I finally get kissed,
I'll know.

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,629
If you've never kissed a guy,
we have bigger problems
than underwear.

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,751
I've kissed a guy.

97
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,148
I've kissed guys.
I just haven't
felt that thing.

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,676
"That thing"?
Is that what you kids
are calling it these days?

99
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,755
That thing. That moment
when you kiss someone

100
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,833
and everything
around you becomes hazy.

101
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,310
And the only thing in focus
is you and this person.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,675
And you realize that
that person is the only person

103
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,070
that you're supposed to kiss
for the rest of your life.

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,636
And for one moment
you get this amazing gift.

105
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,116
And you wanna laugh
and you wanna cry...

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,353
cos you feel so
lucky that you found it

107
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,116
and so scared
that it'll go away,
all at the same time.

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,713
Damn, girl. You are a writer.

109
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,109
(watching the wheels
by John Lennon playing)

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,914
OK, I'm finished.

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,438
what do you guys think?
where do you
think it should go?

112
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,829
In the bedroom?
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

113
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,669
Perfect.

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,112
The meeting just began.
Let me start by saying

115
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,954
I was very impressed with
that investigative piece

116
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,555
that Dutton did on pesticides
in our supermarkets.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,148
But since
the Trib did a piece on

118
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,676
the same subject,
only better, you're fired.

119
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,359
Huh?

120
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,829
Dutton, did you hear me?
You're fired. Out.

121
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,992
Close your cubicle.
Bye-bye, Dutton.

122
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,038
Hello, everybody
else still working here.

123
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,911
Let's celebrate by doing
another undercover feature!

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,879
Now,
you know that my inspiration
for these stories comes,

125
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,310
of course,
from my personal life.

126
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,190
I mean, who would
have thought that my foray
into the hair plugs

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,119
would have resulted in
last month's cover story?

128
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,796
"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow."
A great story.

129
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,276
Last night I'm sitting home
with my family,
having dinner...

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,032
(Anita whispering) Roger.

131
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,395
..and my younger
boy starts to choke!

132
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,712
Then I realized my son
was allergic to peanuts.

133
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,711
I said to myself,

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,078
"Holy shit! I don't
even know my own kids."

135
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,991
"How much do we
know about these

136
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,469
"high-school kids?
what are they thinking?"

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,274
And then it hit me.

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,998
Boom!

139
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,636
"My Semester in High School."

140
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,280
You. what's your name?

141
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,639
J... J... Josie.

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,995
Jos�?
Josie Geller.

143
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,239
Josie Geller,
you enroll Friday! Have fun!

144
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,788
The meeting just ended.

145
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,269
Josie. Josie!

146
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,670
..20-minute handstand.
Freaked the yogi right out.

147
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,751
Excuse me.

148
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,675
Josie...

149
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,594
Uh... It's really happening!

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,389
"My first undercover feature,
by Josie Geller"!

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,914
Josie, maybe you
should turn it down.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,911
why?
You don't think I can do it?

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,152
No! It's just,
this is a lot of pressure
for your first piece.

154
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,231
This is not
a half-a-page article.

155
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,993
This is a major
undercover piece.

156
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,356
Look what Rigfort
just did to Dutton,
and he's his cousin.

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,477
Don't worry. I'm gonna
straighten this all out.

158

think I can do this?

when you wanted to seduce
the mailroom guy,

161
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,911
and you thought
you couldn't learn Spanish,

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,991

on your verbs?

163

164
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,395
Gus, when you wanted
to learn how to knit,

165
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,750
who showed you how
to work the needles?

166
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,512
You did.
You knit?

167
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,472
Yeah.

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,719
So this is my chance.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,833
I'm not holding your
job for you, Geller.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,035
Thank you!

171
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,189
OK...

172
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,510
Don't make me give you
my memo on
interoffice hugging.

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,716
Now comes the hard part.

174
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,674
Oh, my gosh.
You get to be 1 7 again.

175

you're gonna need?

178
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,199
why don't you just
borrow Mom's car?

179
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,949
I can't use a minivan.
I need a cheap car.

180
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,477
A vintage classic.
It's just for
a couple of months.

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,075
A couple of months is like
ten years in Bambi life.

182
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
It's so weird that
you name your cars.

183
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,791
why? Guys name their penises.

184

OK...

185

You can have
my Buick LeSabre and name it
anything you want.

186

Really?

Nah, I don't think so.

shorts or a skirt?

No.

But you could start
before next semester,

199

talk to her about
a baseball scholarship.

200

It's too late,
Josie, you know?

201

I'm not going to college.
I'm not playing
baseball anymore.

You had such a shot
at playing college ball.

205

You let one case
of mono stop you.

206

Don't you want to move
out of Mom and Dad's?
Pay your own bills?

207
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,034
why?
So I can be as happy as you?

208
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,633

Hi.

Hi, Kristen.

It's Kirsten.

318
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,477
Oh. OK.

319
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,119
Oh!

320
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,994
well, that'll teach me
to wear white jeans
after Labor Day.

321

to wear white

Right. Right, right.

you guys' hopes and dreams?

Hi. Yes, you are a guy.
Quite a guy.

I can't believe
he just said that.

He just said that.

333

I'm just gonna go.

Rosalind disguises
herself as a man,

431
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,399
and then escapes
into the forest.

432
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,031
Right. when she's in costume,
she can finally express
her love for Orlando.

433
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,910
Shakespeare's point is that
when we're in disguise,
we feel freer.

434
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,231
we do things we wouldn't do
in ordinary life.

You touch other guys' butts.

438
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,996
It's OK,
cos you're in uniform.

439
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,350
See, disguise
changes all the rules.

440
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,916
Tell you a story.
My first season
of peewee hockey...

441
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,035
well,
honestly, I was terrible.
I couldn't skate.

442
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,917
I was afraid to take a hit.

443
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,638
And my dad one day
bought me this

444
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,395
brand-new helmet,
signed by Gordie Howe.

445
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,349
Come on, guys. Gordie Howe!

446
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,635
OK, he was like
the Tiger woods of hockey.

447
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,035
Oh. All right.

448
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,032
Every time I put
on this helmet,
I feel invincible.

449
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,951
Suddenly, I skate harder.

450
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,473
I check people
left and right.

451
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,314
I even got thrown out of
a game once for fighting.

452
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,473
The point here is that
disguise can be liberating,

453
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,439
can get you
to do things that you
never thought possible.

454
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,795
And for Rosalind,
her male costume

455
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,276
opens the possibilities for
the great love of her life.

456
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,078

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,639
but never,
ever thought would happen?

469
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,280
I'm the most
popular girl in school

470
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,550
and Billy Prince is
asking me to the prom.

471
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,519
Yes.
what?

472
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,719
Billy Prince is
asking you to the prom.

473
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,870
why?

474
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,951
I don't know.

475
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,354
The poem.
I knew he'd like the poem!

476
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,670
Billy Prince is
asking me to the prom?

477
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,392
That's what I'm saying.

478
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,232
Oh, my God! I'm...
I'm actually speechless!

479
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,471
I have no words!
That's never happened to me!

480
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,516
words are my life!

481
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,951
(bell rings)

482
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,269
Just a reminder,
your papers are due
next week.

483
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,797
(over PA) This is Sydney,
student body president.

484
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,758
No going to the library.
There's an asbestos problem.

485
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,637
Can I get into my locker?

486
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,315
(over PA) Now the prom.
Voting on the prom theme
is complete,

487
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,518
and the theme is...
"the Millennium"!

488
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,158
The prom is
going to be rufus.
what's "rufus"?

489
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,789
It's my new, cool,
hip word. Spread it
around like wildfire.

490
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,757
(group) Rufus!

491
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,638
what is it with
this school and prom?

492
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,678
South Glen South competes
every year for best prom.

493
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,231
(British accent)
The theme is everything,
so whatever we pick

494
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,309
has to be totally unique.

495
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,233
There's a land that I see

496
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,478
where the children are free

497
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,878
Come with me, take my hand

498
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,713
And we'll live

499
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,037
In a land where
the river runs free

500
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,078
In a land to a shining sea

501
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,195
And we'll be free
to be you and me

502
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,669
(Josie) what's that?

503
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,751
(Aldys) The old drive-in.
The Court.

504
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,752
It's just a continuous
party for Guy's group.

505
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,599
Hey.

506
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,510
Alpo, the dog park
is that way.

507
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,113
Go.

508
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,878
Last I checked,
this was a free country.

509
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,350
You're not seriously trying
to hang out at the Court.

510
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,228
Cheap wine coolers
and a fire in a trash can.
where do I sign up?

511
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,676
why don't you go home,
fickle around
on your calculator,

512
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,954
whatever you do,

513
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,519
and figure out
how many lifetimes

514
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,955
it's gonna take
you to get cool, OK?

515
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,236
Have you ever wanted
to go to the Court?

516
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,076
Are you kidding, Josie?
It's lame.

517
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,199
All they do is stand around
and get drunk. It's lame.

518
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,794
Yeah, it seems lame.

519
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,318
Yeah. It's very lame.

520
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,118
You said that.

521
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,709
The Court?
Josie, I am appalled.

522
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,679
Geez, I know. I mean, who'd
have known that these kids...

523
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,316
No! I am appalled because
I have a reporter in
there undercover,

524
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,710
for three weeks,
and I had to read
about this in the Trib.

525
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,791
You're right.

526
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,711
No, fold...

527
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,271
"1 7-year-old
Kristin Davis says

528
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,430
"'Yeah, everyone who's anyone
is at the Court on
Saturday night.'"

529
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,150
She's right. I have learned
that it is a popular place
for the kids to go.

530
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,993
This is where
the stories are.

531
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,710
You will become
friends with these people.

532
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,798
You will party with them.
You'll rave with them.

533
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,359
You'll get jiggy with them.

534
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,268
when they go to the prom,
you'll be in
the same damn limo!

535
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,351
Gus, listen.

536
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,952
The popular kids and I...

537
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,555
Do you even know these kids?

538
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,119
They hid my car.

539
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,109
Get to know them, very well!

540
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,153
Your job, and my job,
depends on it!

541
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,310
Um, by the way,
it's "depend" because
there's no S.

542
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,233
Your subject is plural.
Out!

543
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,914
Come on! Asses and elbows!
The news doesn't sleep,
you know!

544
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,834
(announcer)
A high hopper to
third base, but...

545
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,833
Yeah, baby! Mm! whoo!

546
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,040
Rob! You're making a mess.
Can you do this
at Mom and Dad's?

547
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,749
No, it's their turn
to do the Franklin Mint
potluck dinner.

548
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,717
But I made a pizza.

549
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,791
I can't do it.

550
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,876
what?

551
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,191
Damn! These are
high-school girls?

552
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,431
we got some underage hotties
on our hands here.

553
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,036
Gus wants me to be friends
with them, the popular kids.

554
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,395
It's impossible.
why?

555
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,517
You know what it was like
for me in high school.

556
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,229
All I wanted was
to be accepted.

557
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,239
And they just tortured me.
I can't go back to
South Glen South.

558
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,235
You're at South Glen South?
They have a killer
baseball team.

559
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,518
Focus, please.

560
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,591
OK, OK.

561
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,430
You're an adult now, Josie.
You're successful.

562
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,559
You graduated at
the top of your class.
You work for a newspaper.

563
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,838
You wash your hair now.
You're not Josie Grossie
anymore.

564
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,232
Don't you know how much
I just wanted to be you
in high school?

565
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,916
Just for one day
to know what it was
like to be popular.

566
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,389
It's not that hard, Josie.

567
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,790
All you need is
the right person,

568
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,110
one person to think
you're cool, and you're in.

569
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,316
Everyone will be too
scared to question it.

570
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,753
Is that true?

571
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,196
Yeah,
it's a little-known fact.

572
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,073
Don't you want to show 'em?
Gus, Billy Prince, yourself.

573
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,199
Don't you want to show 'em
the cool kids don't
freak you out anymore?

574
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,398
That you can go in there
and be friends with them
and get your story?

575
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,710
Yes, desperately.

576
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,553
Plus, if you quit now,
you're no better than me.

577
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,789
Better than I.

578
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,558
That's the spirit.

579
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,791
So let's hear it.
"I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore."

580
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,269
I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore.

581
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,910
That's it. Now scream it.

582
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,878
I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore!

583
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,871
That's good.

584
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,151
(Here we Go
by Stakka Bo playing)

585
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,959
Josie the Pussycat.

586
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,514
George?
what are you doing here?

587
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,395
Ah. Get in the van.
Go, go.

588
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,391
welcome to the love shack.

589
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,273
All right.

590
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,952
George, what's going on?

591
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,031
A little surveillance.

592
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,918
what are you doing?
Hidden camera.

593
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,989
wings?

594
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,399
Yeah.

595
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,553
That's great, but I
really should talk to Gus
about this first.

596
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,519
(over speaker)
Geller, stop being
a pain in the ass.

597
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,555
Gus?

598
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,872
No, it's
the great and powerful Oz.
You're in way over your head.

599
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,317
Here's how it's gonna work.
I review the tapes,
I find your story.

600
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,951
All right.
Battery, transmitter.
Plug it in.

601
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,354
Man.

602
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,271
There we go.
Good luck to you.

603
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,794
I don't believe
this. George?
Hm?

604
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,792
How are you so cool?

605
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,512
It's hard work.
Herbs, berries.
I'll be watching you.

606
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,879
All right, let's get
this party started. Yeah.

607
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,395
Come on, picture, come on.
There. Oh...

608
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,836
There. Ooh,
they didn't look that good
when I went to high school.

609
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,677
Kirsten, Kristin, Gibby!
what's up, girlfriends?

610
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,958
Ooh.

611
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,234
I'm OK.

612
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,833
That's gonna leave a mark.

613
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,117
"And so it is
Rosalind in disguise

614
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,115
"who is best
able to see through
the disguises of others.

615
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,431
"To say to Phoebe 'Mistress,
know thyself.'

616
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,676
"To look at love
from every angle.

617
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,590
"And to realize, finally,
that she is in
love with Orlando.

618
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,515
"To free both hearts,
not in judgment
but in equality. "

619
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,909
(Mr. Coulson)
That's really well written.

620
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,275
Showtime's over.

been in love?

623
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,879
Leave.

Oh, give it up, Gus.

625

Come on. I'm just
making conversation.

You know, you should go out
every now and then.

a couple of new ties,

like some help,
I would love to help you.

Nope.

637
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,556
Excuse me, do you guys think
that we could work out
some kind of schedule,

638
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,676
and I could work around it?

639

Hey. where's your sweatshirt?

640
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,194
Oh, I must have
forgotten it.

641
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,510
I have an extra
in my locker.
I'll go get it.

642
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,797
So, I'll see you tonight,
7.30, Na-Na's, right?

Have you heard
this band play?

647
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,518
I'll get my mom's car

No offence.
I know you love this.

all out of your system

00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,078
I'm Tracy. I'm 1 6.

781
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,513
I'm a gymnast.

782
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,272
I don't have a boyfriend.

783
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,469
Cool.

784
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,349
Josie?

785
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,474
where were you last night?
I was really worried.

786
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,629
what?

787
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,876
You know,
last night at 7.30?

788
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,436
Na-Na's? I kept calling you,
but I just got your machine.

789
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,592
I don't even know
your parents' line.
I was really worried.

790
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,630
I'm sorry.
I must have forgot.

791
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,236
Maybe you should forget
about sitting with us, too.

792
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,348
Let's make some
money for the prom!

793
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,551
(Brett) Mr. Coulson! Oh!

794
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,835
(Standing By
by willis playing)

795
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,272
watch your step.

796
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,753
where's your partner?

797
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,831
I don't have one.

798
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,718
Lonely ride
in bucket five!

799
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,915
Single!

800
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,991
(Josie) Do you have
to yell it like that?

801
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,354
Sure, I do.

802
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,031
Thank you.
watch your step.

803
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,989
Is this seat taken?

804
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,679
Thank you.

805
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,318
Thank you.
You're welcome.

806
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,035
whoa!

807
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,714
(Mr. Coulson) whoa.

808
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,279
Are you scared?

809
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,510
Uh, well,
I'll tell you
something here.

810
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,274
I hope this doesn't
undermine my position as
an authority figure, but...

811
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,510
I'm a little
afraid of heights.

812
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,349
You're afraid of
the Ferris wheel?

813
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,792
Actually,
it's the plunging
headfirst

814
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,115
into the crowd part
that kind of gets me.

815
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,034
I bet if you had
your Gordie Howe helmet
on you'd feel better.

816
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,313
Hey, you remember
that story?

817
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,231
I remember
everything you say...

818
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,991
in your classroom.

819
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,109
If the bucket's a-rocking,
don't come a-kn-kn-knocking!

820
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,875
Yeah! Yeah!

821
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,152
Boys.
I know.

822
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,595
(youth) Mr. Coulson
rocks my world!

823
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,393
I'd like to tell you that
we all grow out of it.

824
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,469
It's a lie.

825
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,710
Some of us will
always be rattling cages.

826
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,072
why do you do that?

827
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,959
I don't know.

828
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,589
what's scary is that
when you get older,
it gets more confusing.

829
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,230
I mean, you know Lara,
my girlfriend you
met at the club?

830
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,199
we've been going out
for five years,

831
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,039
and now she wants me
to move to New York.

832
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,275
And, you know,
I mean, I should do it.

833
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,675
You know,
make the commitment
and grow up.

834
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,271
I know we have
our differences.

835
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,752
I shouldn't be talking about
this stuff with you.
I'm sorry.

836
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,634
It's nice to have
someone to talk to.

837
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,758
Yeah, same here.

838
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,868
when you're my age,

839
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,952
guys will be
lined up around
the block for you.

840
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,393
You have to say that
cos you're my teacher.

841
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,110
Actually, I shouldn't
say that because
I'm your teacher.

842
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,315
Oh.

843
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,077
Josie Geller? No way.

844
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,429
(Rob) Yeah.

845
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,192
She dated
the drummer from
the Big Bad Voodoo Daddys?

846
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,716
I've always wanted to
be a drummer. Always.

847
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,874
And then she dumped him
for the drummer...

848
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,477
All right, that's it.

849
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,516
Just water
and Ex-Lax till prom.

850
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,755
It's all about hydration.

851
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,078
Did you guys
know that Josie's dad
invented Ex-Lax?

852
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,995
She's, like, the heiress
to the Ex-Lax fortune.

853
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,115
Shut up.

854
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,039
No, it's true.

855
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,389
She spends all of
her extra time
with her family

856
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,675
on a yacht in
the South of France.

857
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,829
wow.

858
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,999
(cheering)

859
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,031
Quick hands,
quick hands.
Here we go.

860
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,269
who's a winner?

861
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,591
Focus. Good work, good work.
Easy, easy. Good work.

862
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,037
Thanks for showing
me that new grip.

863
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,999
It totally
changed my swing, man.

864
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,229
No problem.

865
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,514
Hey, what's goin' on?

866
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,676
You guys know
Josie Geller?

867
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,875
I know her.
You mean Loser?

868
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,312
Nah, man,
she's cool.

869
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,277
I used to go
out with her, man.

870
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,429
what?

871
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,112
She dumped me.
we're still good friends.

872
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,395
Really?

873
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,754
Hey, wait.
Like, how good?

874
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,673
Good friends.
Good good?

875
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,875
She is amazing.

876
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,753
All right, guys.

877
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,232
As you've probably noticed,
this certainly isn't English.

878
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,155
Um...
we've combined a few classes
today here for the seminar.

879
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,159
Hopefully,
the speaker will be
here any minute now.

880
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,112
Hi.
Hey! Oh, hi.

881
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,835
Uh...
You're here for
the sex talk?

882
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,390
well... I like a man
who gets right to the point.

883
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,235
Are you Pam?

884
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,919
If you say so.

885
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,555
OK.

886
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,592
This is Pam Kitterman.
She's leading us in
our sex discussion.

887
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,557
what? what?
Yes. Come on.

888
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,153
No, I'm... what?

889
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,475
I am not...
Oh, I am.

890
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,913
Right, that's correct.

891
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,510
Hi, I'm Pa...
I'm Pam. Hi.

892
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,639
Um, sex...

893
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,115
well, yes, sex...
Um, what do
you say, you know?

894
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,839
Uh... you like a guy,
you do it with him.

895
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,956
Sometimes he calls,
sometimes he doesn't.

896
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,238
whoo!
(nervous chuckle)

897
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,589
Oh.

898
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,874
Hi.

899
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,915
what are you doing here?

900
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,797
I came by to say hello.

901
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,349
Oh, my God,
your teacher is
such a fox!

902
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,629
He's coming back.

903
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,236
Um, why don't we
talk about that later?

904
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,955
And I just wanna say
that the burning
sensation is totally normal.

905
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,629
Ew!

906
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,078
Sex is really fun.

907
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,154
when you're old enough,

908
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,117
which none of you are.

909
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,799
I should know.

910
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,916
Cos when you lose it to
some guy named Junior
with bad breath

911
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,437
in the back of a van,
you're gonna wish
you'd listened to your mom

912
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,875
when she said
"Nobody will buy
the ice-cream truck

913
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,838
"when you're handin' out
the Popsicles for free."

914
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,673
Any questions?

915
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,070
Oh, I know it's hard.
I mean, difficult.
Difficult.

916
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,038
But safe sex is
really important.

917
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,352
OK, so just imagine

918
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,432
that the bananas
are the real thing.

919
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,509
In a land called
Every Man's Fantasy.

920
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,392
God, I can't do this.

921
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,873
(Josie) Maybe because
we're not supposed to be
having sex with bananas.

922
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,636
Do you really think she
hooked up with Rob?

923
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,233
They're so different.

924
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,197
Sometimes opposites attract.

925
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,357
You know what, though?

926
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,358
I feel like I'm
really ready to do it.

927
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,591
You know, like,
have sex for the first time.

928
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,869
It's a big deal.

929
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,069
I know.

930
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,718
Just make sure
you've found
the right person.

931
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,518
You know,
Adelie penguins,

932
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,869
they spend their whole lives
looking for that
one other penguin.

933
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,390
And when they
meet them, they know.

934
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,112
And they spend the rest
of their lives together.

935
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,395
But I'm not a penguin.

936
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,874
It's an analogy.

937
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,353

Sydney here.
Bad news about the prom.

East Glen East is gonna
do "Millennium", too.

942
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,718
what? Oh, my God.

943

(Mr. Coulson)
Calm down.
Calm down!

944
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,232
Calm down! Sit!

945
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,678
Let's focus, all right?

946
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,593
It's prom theme.
All we need is a new idea.

947
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,475
Ooh! How about
"Under the Sea"?

948
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,879
(boy) Yeah, right.

949
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,995
It's been done.

950
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,115
How about "the '80s"?

951

952

Amateurs?

953
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,957
All right.
All right.

Josie.

955
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,312
That's not a theme.

956
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,876
Thank you. No.

957
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,630
OK,
Josie will have the answer.

958
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,832
How about
"Meant for Each Other"?

throughout history.

960
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,999
Absolutely.

961

Absolutely!

962
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,553
Oh, we love it.

963
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,795

Here comes a sign
in the form of a girl

She's the finest,
sweetest thing in the world

It is a great story.

return the clothes

I was just looking
at this cardigan.

986

Isn't it cool?
Oh, yes.

I don't wanna put
extra pressure on you,

Josie, you have
totally transitioned.

1008
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,199
Transitioned?

1009
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,833
Yeah, you crossed over.

It's hard.

and never make it.

probably already heard

that I want to
ask you out to prom.

1095
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,314
But there's
something different
about asking in person.

1096
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,717
I know that we
didn't hit it off
in the beginning.

1097
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,556
And I really...

Yes.

01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,435
Yes.

1100
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,519
That's rufus.

1101
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,558
Uh... where do I
pick you up?

1102
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,471
How do we arrange this?
what do I do?

1103
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,557
we can meet
here at Rob's,

1104
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,632
and we can all share
a limousine together.

1105
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,639
Thank you.

1106
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,437
Have a good evening.

1107
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,479
And thank you.

(At My Most Beautiful
by R.E.M. playing)

1109
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,391
Hey, Jose.
Hey, Rob.

1110
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,152
Lookin' good, guys.

1111
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,075
Josie, Robster,
rufus kegger.

1112
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,952
Man, you were wasted.

1113
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,436
This is so unbelievable.

1114
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,633
I've waited my
whole life to fit in,
and I finally feel like I do.

1115
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:30,955
You do.

1116
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,189
(Gibby) Hey, Rob.

1117
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,477
Hey, Josie,
who did Archie date?
Betty or Veronica?

1118
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,193
Both.
See?

1119
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,875
I always liked Betty better.

1120
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,434
Really?

1121
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,397
Yeah,
Betty was so
fun and spunky.

1122
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,710
I mean,
Veronica had
the great legs.

1123
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,553
She was too moody.
Very high-maintenance.

1124
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,832
You can't refuse to
sell me a ticket to prom.

1125
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,989
Listen, Alpo.

1126
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,036
we can do
whatever we want to.

1127
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,675
Like, I get it.
You guys don't know
how to count change.

1128
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,879
Oh, my God.
I'll make it easy.

1129
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,313
Here's the money.
I'm taking the ticket.

1130
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,513
Oh, my God.

1131
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,912
She was mocking us.

1132
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,950
Did you see that?

1133
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,593
we gotta
make her dog food.

1134
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,669
She is going down.

1135
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,709
There.

1136
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,072
Oh. I got you a meeting
with the admissions guy
from Dartmouth.

1137
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,159
Dartmouth?

1138
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,438
But I wasn't
gonna go to college.

1139
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,596
No, I pulled some strings,

1140
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,673
and I got him to
look at your writing,

1141
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,193
and he agreed
to meet with you.

1142
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,792
You believe in me
that much?

1143
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,199
Of course I do, Josie.

1144
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,437
You owe it to yourself,
to your writing,
to go to college.

1145
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,277
You are a great writer.

1146
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,589
You just have to
find your story.

1147
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,519
He is your story.

1148
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,591
You're crazy. No!

1149
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,275
No. No.

1150
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,278
what do you mean, no?
It's got it all.

1151
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,876
Sex, intrigue, immorality
in the education system.

1152
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,229
He's my teacher.

1153
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,038
Yeah, that's the best part.

1154
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,793
"Student-teacher relations:
how close is too close?"

1155
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,075
we're gonna blow
the lid off it!

1156
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,718
There's no lid.

1157
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,714
There's nothing
going on between Sa...

1158
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,358
Mr. Coulson and me.

1159
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,554
Everyone is
in here every day,
watching you two.

1160
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,471
It's like
The Young and the Restless.

1161
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,676
Rigfort is
salivating over it.

1162
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,751
You pitched this
to Rigfort?

1163
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,716
Josie, this isn't a joke.

1164
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,075
You heard Rigfort.
Both our asses
are on the line.

1165
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,071
Now, this is the story.

1166
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,910
Call me when
you've got it.

1167

(doorbell)

1168
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,513
Josie, you look so...

1169
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,069
Rufus?

1170
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,320
Yes, exactly.
Major rufus.

1171
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,788
what are you
supposed to be?

1172
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,395
Duh!

1173
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,796
Tom Cruise,

1175
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,713
That's nice.

1176
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,275
Thank you for
everything, Rob.

1177
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,876
It's all really happening,

1178
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,510
and I know it's
because of you.

1179
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,597
My wallet. Shit.

1180
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,799
where are you
gonna put it?

1181
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,916
Come on, beautiful.
Let's go.

1182
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,519
Hey, how you doin'?

01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,749
Hello?

1184
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,352
If you don't hurry,
we'll miss the whole thing.

1185
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,359
we'll talk.

Oh, my God.
You totally ripped off
my Malibu Barbie idea!

1188
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,031
Uh-uh.
I'm Disco Barbie.

1189
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,593
And I'm Evening Gown Barbie.

(gasps) Josie, darling,
you look rufus.

1191
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,877
who are you guys?

1192
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,633
Don't tell me.
You're Medieval Barbie?

1193
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,869
Get over it.

1194
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,916
we're Rosalind and Orlando.

1196
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,317
Look, I get to
have a sword.

1197
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,316
Oh, my God,
that is so awesome.

1198
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,559
Rad! That is so rad.

1199
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,959
(Rob) I want a sword.

1200

(Bitter

1201
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,634
(Rob) All right,
look at this place!

1202
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,392
(Josie) Beautiful.

1203
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,994
Come on,
let's dance.
I'm Tom Cruise.

1204

beautiful prom
I've ever been to.

work, Merk,
work, Merk, work it.

1206
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,029
Great.

1207
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,709
what are you doing?

1208
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,872
Practicing my
surprised face for when
they name prom court.

1209
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,673
Oh, sorry, there's
no room at this table.

1210
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,712
It's just
too bad for them.

1211
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,633
wait, I forgot.

1212
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,359
A little surprise for you.

1213
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,959
Did I miss the crowning?

1214
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,598
No, but I'm
closing the pool.

1215
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,716
Josie's odds are 3-1,

1216
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,031
and even money that
that kid pokes
himself with the sword.

1217
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,269
whoa!

1218
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,152
OK, maybe we
should sit down.

1219
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,468
OK.

1220
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,834
OK. whoa.

1221
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,877
Are you having fun yet?

1222
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,791
Uh, yeah.
Good.

1223
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,949
Definitely.

1224
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,553
Guess what.
what?

1225
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,676
Gibby gave me champagne!

1226
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,988
That's nice.

1227
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,195
Yeah.

1228
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,595
Rob? I've been thinking.

1229
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,153
And I think...

1230
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,073
I mean, I know

1231
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,553
you're the one.

1232
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,795
Oh.

1233
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,113
My penguin.

1234
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,631
I want you to
be my first.

1235
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,076
Once the floor
stops spinning,
let's have sex.

1236
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,556
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Put that down.

1237
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,473
All right.

1238
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,668
Tell you what, Tracy.

1239
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,875
what?

1240
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,679
I'm flattered,

1241
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,912
but I say

1242
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,915
I'm gonna go
get some more punch,

1243
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,594
then we'll go on
the dance floor
and boogie.

1244
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,755
That's good.

1245
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,438
(Rob) No! Uh-oh!

1246
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,639
Help! I'm stuck.

1247
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,795
(Sera) Brett!

1248
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,950
(group)
The Denominators
are here!

1249
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,789
whoo!

1250
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,479
(group) Make way
for the Denominators!

1251
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,234
You guys,
what is the one thing

1252
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,590
that could ruin
my senior prom?

1253
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,952
That you would trip
on your Barbie heels
and I'd be named prom queen.

1254
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,868
Did I just
say that out loud?

1255
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,075
whoo!

1256
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,198
So, who are you
supposed to be?

1257
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,918
Other than freaks?
Yeah.

1258
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,311
we're DNA.
Double helix?

1259
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,428
But I guess you'd
actually know that
if you passed bio.

1260
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,434
No, no,
don't touch the hydrogen.
It's rented.

1261
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,233
Yo, yo,
ladies and gentlemen,

1262
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,676
give it up for Mr. Coulson
and Miss Knox!

1263
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,994

1264
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,876

01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,954
Miss Kristin Davis...

1268

Miss Kirsten Leosis

and Mr. Rob...

01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,034
Mr. Rob.

1274
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,108
Mr. Rob!

1275
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,952
(Miss Knox) Mr. Rob.

1276
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,759
That's me!

1277
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,908
Yeah!

1278
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,868
whoo!

1279
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,109
(Miss Knox) Next up,
South Glen 's prom king,

Guy Perkins.

1281
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,596
And this year's prom queen.

1282
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,273

Josie Geller!

1285
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,949
Yeah!

1286
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,792
I knew you could
do it, girl.

1287
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,235
And as is custom,
the king and the queen

1288
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,515
will now have
their first dance.

(Erase/Rewind

1290
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,116
I never made it
to my prom.

1291
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,394
Really?

1292
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,669
I only made it to
the parking lot.

1293
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,956
Tell me what
you're thinking.

1294
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,309
I was thinking
about Shakespeare,

1295
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,508
how he described
a night like this.

1296
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:28,636
"Look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with
patines of bright gold."

1297
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,316
what are you
thinking about?

1298
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,548
My sword.

1299
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,755
Oh.

1300
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,236
Josie,
you rock my world.

1301
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,829
You're, like,
the most amazing girl
that I've ever dated.

1302
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,839
You're so fun to be with.
You're smart,

1303
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,799
you're crazy.

1304
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,199
You are...

1305
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,832
You rock my world.

1306
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,757
You said that already.

1307
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,789
Yeah.

changing my mind

01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:21,077
I've changed my mind

1311
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,277
Is this chocolate? OK.

1312
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:39,995
Hey.

1313
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,115
Hi.

1314
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,512
wow, you make a really
beautiful prom queen.

1315
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,954
Really?

1316
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,272
Thanks. So do you.

1317
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,869

kind of a goofball

my own wedding.

1319

Do you...
Do you wanna...

1320
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,035
OK.

1321
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,629
Hello.

1322
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,272
Aldys, I figured
that since it's prom,

1323
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,030
Iet's put all
the shit behind us.

1324
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,793
I would love nothing more
than to dance with you.

1325
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,198
(Please, Please, Please,
Let Me Get what I want
by the Smiths playing)

1326
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,799
All right.

1327
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,150
That's, of course,
if it's OK with the rest
of the double helix.

1328
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,068
Yes? OK.

1329
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,950
You know, it's funny.
Proms always make
me a little sad.

1330
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,234
They're so final,
you know?

1331
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,118
Graduation,
everyone scattering,
moving on.

1332
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,276
Is your girlfriend here?

1333
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,397
No. No, I'm alone.

1334
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,676
In fact,
we broke up last week.

1335
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,989
Really?

1336
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,675
That's funny
because, actually,

1337
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,955
"prom" comes from
"promenade",

1338
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,877
and you can't
promenade alone, can you?

1339
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,035
You're amazing,
Josie Geller.

1340
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,993
Have you thought about
Dartmouth any more?

1341
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,875
Yes.

1342
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,712
And there's something
that I wanna tell you.

1343
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,030
No, no, no.
Not now, not now!

1344
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,155
There's something
I wanna tell you, too.

1345
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,352
No! No!

1346
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,108
I knew it!
You are a loser!

1347
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,311
You ruined everything!

1348
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,034
You so do not
deserve to be prom queen!

1349
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,556
Let me tell you something.

1350
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,190
I don't care about being
your stupid prom queen.

1351
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,917
I'm 25 years old!

1352
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,517
I'm an undercover reporter
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

1353
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,279
And I have been
beating my brains out,

1354
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,035
trying to impress you people!

1355
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,469
Let me tell you something,
Gibby, Kirsten, Kristin.

1356
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,715
You will spend your lives
trying to keep others down

1357
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,519
because it makes you
feel more important!

1358
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,948
why her?

1359
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,273
Let me tell you
something about this girl.

1360
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,112
She is unbelievable.

1361
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,469
I was new here,
and she befriended me,
no questions asked.

1362
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,150
But you,
you were only my friend
after my brother Rob

1363
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,192
posed as a student
and told you to like me.

1364
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,359
Robby Rob?
Ew.

1365
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,431
All of you people,
there is a big
world out there.

1366
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,158
Bigger than prom,

1367
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,833
bigger than high school,

1368
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,868
and it won't matter
if you were the prom queen

1369
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,517
or the quarterback
of the football team

1370
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,313
or the biggest nerd
in school.

1371
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,397
Find out who you are

1372
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,435
and try not to
be afraid of it.

1373
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,193
Excuse me.

1374
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,030
whoo! whoo! Yeah!

1375
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,038
wow, that was
just like Carrie.

1376
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,634
I thought she was
gonna kill us all.

1377
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,635
All right, you guys.
Go, Rams!

1378
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,828
All right.

1379
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,515
Can somebody take
the Alpo girls outside
and hose 'em off?

1380
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,670
South Glen,
class of 1999,

1381
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,031
are you ready to party?

1382
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,670
we lost the feed.
Gus is goin' nuts.

1383
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,113
He's calling
every five minutes.

1384
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,077
Did you get the story?

1385
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,388
No.

1386
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,596
Tell me you got
something on Coulson.

1387
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,715
No!

1388
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,632
I'm just gonna go.

1389
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,474
So... Surprise.

1390
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,916
"Surprise",
you were doing
a story on me?

1391
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,871
No, I couldn't.

1392
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,436
I mean, "surprise",
I was hoping...

1393
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,635
what?

1394
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,395
what?
You were hoping what?
That I'd be happy?

1395
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,313
Because suddenly
I was allowed to be
attracted to you?

1396
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,352
You were attracted to me?

1397
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,509
Goddamn it.

1398
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,238
You set me up
for a story.

1399
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,673
No, I... I...

1400
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,872
Just drop the act.

1401
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,515
OK?

1402
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,717
I mean, every word
out of your mouth
has been a complete lie.

1403
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,998
I don't know you at all.

1404
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,753
Look, if we
could just spend
some time together,

1405
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,070
you could
get to know me again.

1406
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,396
wait, please
don't walk away.

1407
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,674
I just can't look
at you the same way.

1408
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,549
Rob.

1409
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,352
Hey, Josie.

1410
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,874
I came by to check on you.
I was worried about you.

1411
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,799
Really?

1412
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,075
No, not really.

1413
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,233
Not really, Josie.

1414
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,630
How could you
do this to me?

1415
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,790
I helped you.
I got you everything
you wanted.

1416
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,917
And you repay me by
blowing everything

1417
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,150
two days before
the championship!

1418
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,719
I wasn't even thinking.

1419
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,398
No, you weren't.

1420
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,949
Did it occur to you
that the only time

1421
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,473
I've been happy in
the past five years

1422
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,758
is when I'm playing ball,
when I'm part of a team?

1423
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,195
Josie, it's not even
about playing.

1424
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,793
I taught those guys things.

1425
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,235
I helped 'em.
My life had meaning.

1426
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,829
I...

1427
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,273
Just forget about it.

1428
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,352
It's over.
Back to the Tiki Post.
Totally lame.

1429
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,550
"Josie Geller
Blows Her Cover."

1430
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,192
And we were scooped.

1431
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,030
we've got nothing. Zippo.

1432
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,309
Josie,
you totally and completely
screwed both of us.

1433
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,638
Maybe I could
talk to Rigfort.

1434
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,352
Tell him the whole story.

1435
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,715
You know,
I'll tell you a story, OK?

1436
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,438
It's about this
shy copy editor

1437
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:43,030
who makes a total mockery
of herself and her boss

1438
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,033
when she completely
botches her first
assignment as a reporter.

1439
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,390
we are not screwed.

1440
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,311
Yes, I made a mistake.

1441
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,876
But we will
have a story, OK?

1442
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,789
You will have
an amazing story.

1443
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,074
Please.

1444
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,877
Oh, please.
Oh, please.

1445
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,953
(Closer to Myself
by Kendall Payne playing)

1446
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,396
Excuse me, gentlemen,

1447
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,268
I suggest you cover up
what you don't want seen.

1448
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,679
Thank you.

1449
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,072
Coach Romano?
Yeah?

1450
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,470
I'm Josie Geller
from the Chicago Sun-Times.

1451
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,596
I have a favor
to ask you.

1452
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,240
Do you know
the sports guy,
Jim Lakin?

1453
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,352
Sure, everybody
tries to get Big Jim

1454
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,670
to come watch
their games. why?

1455
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,436
what if I told you
that I can guarantee you
that Big Jim

1456
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,149
and every other
reporter in the area
would cover your game?

1457
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,556
I'd say you
could have whatever
you wanted, young lady.

1458
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,359
Someone once told me
that to write well,

1459
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,715
you have to
write what you know.

1460
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,472
This is what I know.

1461
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,630
I am 25 years old,

1462
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,280
and I have never really
kissed a guy.

1463
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,232
A geek to the core,
most of my childhood
was spent

1464
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,232
doing extra homework
I requested from the teacher.

1465
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,157
High school was
more of the same.

1466
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:34,631
Then, at 1 7,
it seemed as if my luck
was about to change.

1467
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,553
The cutest guy asked me
to the senior prom.

1468
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,391
But it turned out
he invited me
as a cruel joke,

1469
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,391
and I have
never fully recovered.

1470
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,390
Yes, it is embarrassing
to share this with the world.

1471
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,158
But it would be
hard to explain

1472
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,629
what I learned
and how I learned it

1473
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,029
without sharing this
humiliating history.

1474
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,071
I received an assignment,
my first as a reporter,

1475
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,394
to go back
to high school and find out
about kids today.

1476
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,154
what I ended up finding
was myself,

1477
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,394
and that high school
hasn 't changed.

1478
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,829
There's still that
one teacher who marches
to her own drummer.

1479
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,036
Those girls are still there,

1480
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,111
the ones that,
even as you grow up,

1481
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,159
will remain
the most beautiful girls
you have ever seen close up.

1482
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,714
The smart kids,
who everyone else
knew as the brains,

1483
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,957
but I just knew them
as my soul mates,

1484
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,032
my teachers, my friends.

1485
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,080
And there's still
that one guy,

1486
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,191
with his
mysterious confidence,

1487
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,397
who seems so perfect
in every way.

1488
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,950
The guy you get up
and go to school for
in the morning.

1489
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,313
South Glen
would not have been
the same without him.

1490
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,676
High school
would not have been
the same without him.

1491
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,473
I would not have
been the same
without him.

1492
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:08,272
I lived a lifetime of regret
after my first
high-school experience.

1493
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,553
And now, after my second,
my regrets are down to one.

1494
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,669
A certain teacher
was hurt on my path
to self-discovery,

1495
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,277
and, although this article
may serve as a step,

1496
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,398
it in no way makes up
for what I did to him.

1497
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,437
To this man,
you know who you are,

1498
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,639
I am so sorry.

1499
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,196
And I would like to
add one more thing...

1500
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,315
(knock on door)

1501
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,753
Movers.

1502
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,438
Hang on a second.

1503
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,750
I think I am
in love with you.

1504
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,391
And so I propose this,

1505
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,072
as an ending
to this article,

1506
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,311
and perhaps a beginning to
the next chapter of my life,

1507
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,231
I, Josie Geller,

1508
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,039
will be at the state
championship baseball game,

1509
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:57,874
where my friends,
the South Glen Rams,
are playing for the title.

1510
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,837
I will stand on
the pitcher's mound

1511
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,753
for five minutes,
prior to the first pitch.

1512
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,994
If this man
accepts my apology,

1513
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,551
I ask him to come kiss me

1514
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,071
for my first real kiss.

1515
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,631
Look over here!

1516
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,233
Josie! Josie!

1517
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,392
Thank you all for coming.

1518
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,993
(Anita) Josie!

1519
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,550
Oh, my God. There's so
many people here.

1520
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,110
They're behind you.
They feel like
they know you.

1521
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,393
It's romantic,
and they wanna be
a part of it.

1522
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,756
I'm glad that
you guys are.

1523
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,433
Oh, Anita!

1524
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,717
Sweet Jesus,
I had no idea there'd be
this many TV crews here.

1525
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,632
You held up your
end of this bargain.

1526
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,472
Now get out there
and get him!

1527
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,754
(smacks)

1528
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,916
(crowd) Josie!
Josie! Josie!

1529
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,076
Josie! Josie!
Josie! Josie!

1530
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,115
Josie! we love you!

1531
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,759
Thank you.

1532
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,638
May I have
five minutes on
the clock, please?

1533
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,075
Hi!

1534
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,430
wieners!
I got hot wieners.

1535
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,078
Hi, Mr. Rigfort.

1536
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,755
Get in your own row!

1537
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,909
I got wieners here.

1538
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,194
Give 'em to me.

1539
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,838
Thank you, Gus.

1540
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,833
Have a wiener.

1541
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,998
I love this.

1542
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,438
Sun-Times readers
out here en masse,

1543
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:03,830
relating personally to
one of our reporters.

1544
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,157
It's amazing,
isn't it?

1545
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,198
Eight, seven...

1546
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,038
That is so wrong.

1547
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,069
wait.

1548
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,795
Mr. Coulson!

1549
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,439
(cheering)

1550
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,228
(Don't worry, Baby
by the Beach Boys playing)

1551
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,912
well, it's been
building up inside of me

1552
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,798
For, oh, I don't
know how long

1553
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,518
Yeah, Mr. Coulson!

1554
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,749
Yeah!

1555
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,910
I don't know why
But I keep thinking

1556
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,312
Something's bound to go wrong

1557
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:10,078
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize

1558
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:15,280
And she says
Don't worry, Baby

1559
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,628
Everything will
turn out all right

1560
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,749
Don 't worry, Baby

1561
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,678
Sorry I'm late.

1562
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,430
It took me forever
to get here.

1563
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,637
I know what you mean.

1564
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:51,472
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive

1565
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:57,078
when she says
Don't worry, Baby

1566
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:02,229
Everything will
turn out all right

1567
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,150
Don 't worry, Baby

1568
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,273
All right.

1569
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,948
Attagirl.

1570
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,229
All right,
let's play ball, kids!
Come on!

1571
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,831
She told me
Baby, when you race today

1572
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,476
Just take along
my love with you

1573
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,438
And if you knew
how much I loved you

1574
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,433
Baby, nothing
could go wrong with you

1575
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:46,114
Oh, what she does to me

1576
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:49,510
when she makes love to me

(Innocent Journey

Love is an innocent,
innocent journey

1579

Love is the cancer,
love ain't benign

1580

Love is what keeps you
going all the time now

Set their sights on you

1588
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,638
I'll know what to do

1589
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:42,429
Love is what I came for
Love is what's in store for

I've got eyes to see

1599
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,678
Looking for someone

1600
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,552
Love could come along

1601
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,312

(Until You Loved Me
by the Moffatts playing)

1609
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,953
Monday morning
came too soon

1610
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:39,395
I think about you now
Layin ' in my room

1611
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:44,711
Hearing everything you said

1612
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,509
I play it back
A hundred times in my head

1613
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:53,319
Then I slip into a dream

1614
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:57,234
The feelin ' inside
Is ten stories high

1615
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:01,472
Never knew what love was
Until you loved me

1616
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:06,475
Never knew what love was
Oh, yeah

1617

'Cause it feels
so good sometimes

1618
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:15,109
Don 't you know
it feels so bad sometimes,

1619
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,317
The way you loved me,
loved me

1620
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,797
The way you loved me,
loved me
