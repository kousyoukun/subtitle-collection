1
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,268
I do as I please!

2
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,758
Oh, hey, what do we got here?

3
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,851
You got Riggs.

4
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,861
Hey, Neil.

5
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,960
I just scouted it.

6
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:43,766
How is it?

7
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:45,667
It's a gold mine!

8
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:51,965
Yeah, once we gut the forest, baby, you got prime-A real estate, I'm telling you.

9
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:55,969
Sanders? I don't know. My men say he's doing fine,

10
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:58,448
but I plan on swinging by tomorrow and letting him know

11
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:00,382
that I'll be taking over operations.

12
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,314
Hello? Mr. Lyman?

13
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:04,778
Hello?

14
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,293
Give a hoot, don't pollute.

15
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:13,089
Whatever.

16
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,100
Oh, what's this? Out of the way, fuzzball.

17
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,874
You got to the count of three, little man. One...

18
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,244
That was awesome.

19
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,299
No, put that down.

20
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:03,102
Ha, ha. Very funny. Bad raccoon.

21
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,311
Bad, bad, raccoon.

22
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,750
Mr. Lyman, I quit!

23
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,252
Nature.

24
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:06,903
Look alive, people, the capitán on deck.

25
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:11,542
Morning, Frank. Men seem to be making good progress.

26
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:15,301
There's nothing like having the boss living on site. Duck.

27
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,507
I have a question, you have the answer.

28
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,140
That's the way you get things done around here.

29
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:20,741
These past few months have been a blessing for me.

30
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,411
Look out, there.

31
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,779
Hop.

32
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,853
So, good progress on unit number five.

33
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,895
I don't know if I can say the same thing about number three.

34
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,395
It's the beaver dam.

35
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:35,024
It's a good one, too. It's blocking the drainage about 30 yards in.

36
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,328
How long's that gonna set us back?

37
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,390
- There we go. - Back.

38
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,697
Well, you want me to keep the beaver dam? You're looking at a week.

39
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:43,866
If not, we can bust it up. The beavers, they're not home.

40
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,744
I don't know. We're a green company, Frank.

41
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,913
I can make it look like an accident.

42
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:54,281
Oops. I accidentally left a stick of dynamite inside the beaver dam.

43
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:59,783
I don't know. I don't want to rock the boat before Mr. Lyman gets here.

44
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:05,490
So, tell you what. Why don't you work up some numbers, get back to me?

45
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:08,624
Hey, while you're at it, pull the boys off of number three

46
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,294
and get them started on the plumbing on number five.

47
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,770
You heard the captain! We're moving on to five!

48
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,373
- Really? - Great.

49
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,445
Psst! Shoo!

50
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,777
Those are my blueberries.

51
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,642
Hear it coming I know you feel it

52
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:58,080
We both got it No need to steal it

53
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:01,049
Nature.

54
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,453
Don't mind much Maybe not today

55
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:08,049
In your heart Can't wish it all away

56
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:10,754
Fight for it Careful what you say

57
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,400
- Homesick much? - I'm working on it.

58
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:21,069
Whatever you want We got it all!

59
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:26,169
Rise and shine, Tyler-iffic.

60
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:28,879
First day of school.

61
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:36,649
Yeah, yeah Let's go home

62
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:41,219
Let's go home

63
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:44,521
What's that, fatty? You gonna cry?

64
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,690
Take it up to seven with an incline of five on the double!

65
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,902
And no cheating!

66
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,004
Yeah, yeah, yeah

67
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,269
We got it all!

68
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:10,020
- Morning, honey. - Morning, sweetie.

69
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,488
So, what's new in the world?

70
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,051
Well, crime rate's going up in Chicago.

71
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,429
See? That's another thing to be grateful for. No crime here. Nothing but peace and quiet.

72
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,826
- That is temporary. - Mmm-hmm.

73
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,737
Oh, Dan, wild turkeys. Wild turkeys.

74
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,770
Dan, stop. Hey. You can't eat that in front of them.

75
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,871
Put it down. It could be their mom.

76
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,974
How do they know it's turkey bacon and not bacon-bacon?

77
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:47,214
They have a sixth sense. Put it down.

78
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:51,894
Hey, honey. How'd you sleep?

79
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,426
Not good. I had this awful nightmare that my insensitive parents uprooted me

80
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:59,595
from my wonderful home and dumped me in the middle of nowhere.

81
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,536
He just misses his friends.

82
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,474
How can he miss his friends? He spent the whole summer

83
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,571
cooped up in his room talking to them online with his computer.

84
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,309
He knows the deal, all right?

85
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,851
We're here for a year, and then we go back to Chicago.

86
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,284
Maybe you should talk to him.

87
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:18,151
What for? That'll just irritate him more.

88
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:20,784
Dan, you're his dad. Try.

89
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,133
So, Tyler, care to join me outside for some fresh mountain air?

90
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,895
Come on, Tyler, I bet there's probably some really cute girls at your school.

91
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,736
And they really dig your hip city vibe.

92
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:40,209
Yeah. I bet you're right. I bet there are some cute girls out there.

93
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,838
- There you go. - You know what else there are?

94
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:44,848
Poisonous rattlesnakes!

95
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,647
Yeah, they're all over the forest.

96
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,516
I'm gonna end up like this guy.

97
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:53,516
All right, you win. I'll quit my job, we pack up the car

98
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,992
and we go back to Chicago. Would that make you happy?

99
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,653
Don't answer that question.

100
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:01,197
- No, no, no. Don't touch. - What?

101
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,460
For my boss.

102
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,764
- All of them? - Yeah, all 38 of them.

103
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,003
- I don't know what kind he likes. - Seriously?

104
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,797
Hey, are we cool?

105
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,604
Yeah, never better.

106
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,337
Great.

107
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:51,375
Johanna drove slowly into the city

108
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,247
The Hudson River all filled with snow

109
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,152
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger

110
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,191
A thousand years in one piece of silver

111
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:07,959
She took it from his lily-white hand

112
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,399
Showed no fear She'd seen the thing

113
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:13,130
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

114
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:14,330
Have a good one.

115
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:18,468
- Three months down. - And nine to go.

116
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:19,635
Yeah.

117
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:30,843
Look outside The raincoats coming, say "Oh"

118
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:36,318
Look outside The raincoats coming, say "Oh"

119
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:46,034
$50,000 for the overage on a beaver dam?

120
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,832
You're sure the beavers aren't home?

121
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,547
All right, just take care of it.

122
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,946
Make it look like an accident. I'll call you later, Frank.

123
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,550
Johanna drove slowly into the city

124
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:08,285
The Hudson River all filled with snow

125
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:11,226
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger

126
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:32,677
Mr. Lyman, welcome to Rocky Springs.

127
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,841
Hey, Dan.

128
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:40,223
Hope we didn't keep you waiting. Just bought the plane yesterday

129
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,350
and wanted to see how she handled warp factor two.

130
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:46,223
And this is for your son.

131
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,991
Oh, thank you. That's really very kind of you.

132
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:52,093
He's going on four, right?

133
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,763
No, actually, he's gonna be 16 next month.

134
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,469
- No. - No, memo says four. You sure?

135
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:02,035
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

136
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,278
Actually, no, the toy's...

137
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,117
- Excuse me? - The toy is great and he's gonna love it.

138
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:19,060
- Isn't it crazy how time flies? - Isn't it?

139
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,927
- I have two kids of my own. - Three.

140
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,489
Three, and I remember when

141
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,125
- what's-his-name and... - Tony.

142
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:25,328
...John and... - Yoko Junior.

143
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,098
...were just babies.

144
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,140
- Memories. - They're my kids.

145
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:31,708
So, I got the car here.

146
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:35,640
I brought some sandwiches and it's about an hour to the site.

147
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:38,045
An hour? Both ways?

148
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:40,746
Two hours round-trip.

149
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,253
I don't think so.

150
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,120
Sandwiches? Gross.

151
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:03,203
Now just be sure to check your curriculums carefully.

152
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:07,734
The board is very strict about no child being left behind. Capisce?

153
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,639
Okay, first things first. I'd like to give a warm welcome

154
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,379
to our brand new science teacher,

155
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,513
Tammy, from Chicago.

156
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:22,484
Now, as I'm sure many of you already know,

157
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,994
one of our math teachers, Mr. Bowen, is out sick for the rest of the year,

158
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:31,866
so we find ourselves without a chairman for the Forest Festival.

159
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,563
Either one of you volunteers, or I say we just junk it.

160
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,201
But we've always had a Forest Festival.

161
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:43,111
The children love painting the pinecones

162
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,617
and playing "Mother May I?" With Bessie the Cow.

163
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,653
Claire, Bessie the Cow was put down in 1972.

164
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:53,817
That's nice. Nice.

165
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:57,055
Bessie the Cow, Bessie the Cow

166
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,062
Isn't tenure wonderful?

167
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,392
Will you ever retire?

168
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:05,795
Excuse me, I...

169
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,600
- That's so great! We have a volunteer. - No, I...

170
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:12,473
Tammy Sanders is officially in charge of the Forest Festival.

171
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,602
Yay, Tammy.

172
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,504
We're gonna have so much fun.

173
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,907
Bessie the Cow, Bessie the Cow

174
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,045
Bessie jumped over the moon

175
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,248
Oh, boy.

176
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:29,382
Click. Page down, page down, page down, page down, page down. Page up.

177
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:32,685
As you can see from the photographs here,

178
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:35,597
we are 16% under budget.

179
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,100
Good, good.

180
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:40,298
Which I'm very pleased about, because at this rate,

181
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:45,104
we are going to be completed with the construction by March.

182
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,905
- Guaranteed. - That's great.

183
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,205
Now you'll be ready for phase two.

184
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,440
Oh.

185
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,441
Sorry, what's phase two?

186
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,046
Show him the plans.

187
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:59,647
All right. You are in charge of phase one, which is this right now.

188
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:03,091
- Right. - And this is phase two.

189
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:08,926
So you're just gonna take out the whole forest?

190
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,057
Yeah.

191
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,462
Mmm?

192
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:14,727
Huh?

193
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:21,576
But we're replacing it with a shopping mall with a forest theme.

194
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:24,672
Dan, do you know why they call me "The King of Green"?

195
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,341
Because I love this planet.

196
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:30,180
Unfortunately, I have to deal with these eco-hypocrites.

197
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:32,984
They say they want to save the planet, but only if it's convenient.

198
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:35,958
You ever notice that? They always drink venti latte with recycled cups,

199
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:38,120
and all of a sudden they're part of the solution?

200
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,357
What I need from you isn't a commitment to green,

201
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,661
but a grasp of the shades of gray.

202
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,528
I understand.

203
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:49,300
Great. So you'll be heading up phase two for the next four years.

204
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,702
Four years?

205
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:56,309
Sir, I relocated my family here for one year.

206
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,941
Yeah, that was until Riggs disappeared on me.

207
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,985
My wife and my... My son are...

208
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,781
Oh, God.

209
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:06,221
Dan, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you.

210
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,758
I'll double your salary. Think about it.

211
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,987
You have 10 seconds or I'm pulling the offer.

212
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:14,224
Ten,

213
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,391
nine-eight-seven-six-five-four three-two-one!

214
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,935
All right, I'll do it.

215
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,305
You're doing the right thing, Dan.

216
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,300
Oh, no, you're crazy. What?

217
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,144
- Felder. - Okay, big guy, this meeting's over.

218
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:33,843
Hold on for a second, Mom. Just let me... What?

219
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,747
Bye-bye.

220
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,560
My wife is going to kill me.

221
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:52,367
Dan, we're a family, all right? We make decisions together.

222
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:56,806
Look, it's not such a bad thing. Think of it as a promotion.

223
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,902
Yeah. If anybody needs me, I'll be at a friend's house.

224
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,578
Oh! Oh, wait, I don't have any friends here.

225
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:06,582
Look, guys,

226
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:10,409
this is an opportunity to do something good for our family

227
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,285
and for the environment, too.

228
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,519
How is ripping out the forest good for the environment?

229
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:16,651
It's not like that.

230
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:19,161
We're Lyman Enterprises. We're the good guys. We're green.

231
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,562
Yeah, as in the color of money.

232
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:25,864
And speaking of money. Who wants a new Wii? Huh?

233
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,756
Oh, come on.

234
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:27,725
Birds.

235
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,298
Hey.

236
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:39,841
You, go away.

237
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:03,300
Hey, guys, can we just take a look at the sprinkler system?

238
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,335
No problem, Mr. Sanders.

239
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:08,563
Hi.

240
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:10,873
Check out Mr. Pee-Pee Pants.

241
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:15,808
Just had a little problem with a raccoon.

242
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:20,245
Well, that's funny. He must have scampered off.

243
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:21,781
Hilarious.

244
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,586
Are you still mad at me?

245
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,246
What do you think?

246
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:28,486
Well, excuse me for caring about the environment.

247
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:39,595
Hello, jefe. The beaver dam problem is gone. Yes. Yes!

248
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:43,640
Oh. Blowing up beavers, are we?

249
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,073
They weren't home.

250
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:47,042
Well, that was eco-friendly of you.

251
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,948
- Let go - Let go

252
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,745
- Give in - Give in

253
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,308
- Give up - Give up

254
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:56,944
- Surrender - Surrender

255
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:58,818
- Let go - Let go

256
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,550
- Give in - Give in

257
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,115
- Give up - Give up

258
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,592
- Surrender - Surrender

259
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:06,623
Hello, sir.

260
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:08,255
Dan, Neil Lyman.

261
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:13,331
Listen, our plane got in early. I was thinking about scouting the site.

262
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:14,769
Oh, jeez!

263
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,668
How's everything on your end?

264
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:20,701
Hot! Hot!

265
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:27,783
Oh, come on!

266
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:36,893
Okay, little buddy, come on, move along.

267
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:40,791
Move it!

268
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:45,532
All right.

269
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,032
Hey!

270
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,138
Come on, shoo. Beat it.

271
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,269
Go on, beat it. Scat. Go.

272
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,545
I'm late for work.

273
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,117
Thank you.

274
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:12,128
Come on!

275
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:23,168
All right, what is your...

276
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:26,203
Rabies!

277
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,482
You wanna play games?

278
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,310
Let's play games.

279
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:04,007
All right. You asked for it.

280
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:22,354
I'll do it. Don't think I won't.

281
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,794
Mr. Lyman.

282
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:31,035
Dan, if this is some kind of stall tactic, I'm not finding it very clever.

283
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:33,133
That's because there's a very good reason...

284
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:35,741
Miley Cyrus!

285
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:07,806
Seriously?

286
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,214
Please.

287
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:17,721
Come on, please, one. Just one bar. Two bar, three bar. Good.

288
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:19,889
Mr. Lyman, it's Dan Sanders.

289
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,857
Sanders, do you like working for me?

290
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:23,188
Yes, sir. I'm just...

291
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:24,585
I'll call you back!

292
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:27,256
I'm stuck on this plane, and I'm very hungry.

293
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:31,826
I want a veggie burrito, hold the guacamole, no cilantro.

294
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:33,426
I repeat... Are you taking this down?

295
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:37,597
All right, well, clearly, something went wrong,

296
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:40,200
because his office called and said he never made the meeting.

297
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:44,270
Maybe he ran into an old friend or an old flame.

298
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:46,006
Thank you, Frank.

299
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,108
Keep your hands away from the vehicle.

300
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,881
Do not freak out. Stand down.

301
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:10,069
Hi, Mrs. Sanders. My name is Wilson.

302
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,507
I run security for Lyman. I protect his assets, if you will.

303
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:18,071
I'm here because I got a 425 call over my walkie-talkie.

304
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:19,638
What's a 425?

305
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:20,877
A four...

306
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:24,977
Ow!

307
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:29,292
You know, now is not a good time to field questions from civilians.

308
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,488
- This your husband's car? - Yes, we both know that. Is he okay?

309
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:33,928
You tell me.

310
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:35,596
I tell you?

311
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,328
Yeah, we found his car and his phone

312
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:40,927
abandoned 2.7 clicks into the Meriweather Pass.

313
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:43,599
Well, did you notify the police about my husband?

314
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:46,034
I think we both don't want to call the police.

315
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,600
You tell them and the next thing you know,

316
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:51,842
you'll have 60 Minutes up here trying to sensationalize the murder.

317
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,208
- Murder? - What murder?

318
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:55,877
- You said "murder." - There something you want to tell me

319
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:56,942
about the murder?

320
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,318
Dad got murdered?

321
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,091
Come here, Skippy. We're gonna find old Daddy,

322
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:06,528
whether he's in one piece or lots of little tiny chopped up ones.

323
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,030
- What? - In the meantime,

324
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:11,659
how would you like to be my deputy? Huh? Look at him.

325
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,259
Yeah, a hat.

326
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:16,698
- Dan. Dan! - Huh?

327
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:19,208
What happened? I was so worried about you.

328
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:23,402
- What happened? - Well, there was a ravine and a boulder,

329
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,143
and then this maniacal raccoon, and then I lost my phone.

330
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:28,880
Oh.

331
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:30,750
I'm gonna borrow your charger. I have to call Lyman.

332
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,584
What happened? Wait, honey, what...

333
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:35,216
- Dan? What... - Mr. Lyman, it's Dan Sanders. Listen...

334
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,657
Well, that was touching.

335
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:40,219
Well, well, well. I guess you're off the hook.

336
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:43,429
Excuse me?

337
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:45,565
Dismissed.

338
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,963
Just don't leave town.

339
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:55,205
I got eagle eyes, Amazon woman.

340
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:57,977
Yeah. Don't freak out.

341
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,548
Come on.

342
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:06,816
Freak.

343
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,761
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

344
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,927
Tomorrow.

345
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:16,498
Absolutely. That's right.

346
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:20,963
I know. Uh-huh.

347
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:23,567
Great.

348
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:28,335
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, we will be ready for Mr. Gupta and the Indian investors.

349
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:30,875
I see.

350
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:35,009
Yes, sir. I know. All right. Have a good night.

351
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:39,050
Was it something I said?

352
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:45,158
Tammy, can I come in?

353
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,395
It's your house.

354
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:54,500
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:59,598
I shouldn't have called Lyman first. I don't know what I was thinking.

356
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,302
Do you have any idea how worried I was about you?

357
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:06,211
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

358
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:09,477
It's just, I figured that if I can keep Lyman happy,

359
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,544
then I can give you and Tyler the world.

360
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:14,557
Dan, we don't want the world. We just want you.

361
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:20,663
I get it. So, if anyone needs me, I'll be on the couch.

362
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:24,158
You don't have to sleep on the couch.

363
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:26,498
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

364
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,533
Wow, that's a lot of work for third graders.

365
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:35,203
I got roped into being in charge of the local Forest Festival.

366
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,473
Cool.

367
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:40,347
I would tell you more, but you are in desperate need of a shower.

368
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:43,515
I'm on it. Watch this.

369
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,956
I'm married to a lunatic.

370
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:31,467
Shut it.

371
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:37,238
Lady Gaga!

372
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:45,809
What the... Hey.

373
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:51,412
Shut up! Go be a pecker somewhere else!

374
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:56,587
Go on, get out of here.

375
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:58,586
Dan?

376
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:02,631
Good riddance.

377
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,361
Who are you talking to?

378
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:06,766
This crow.

379
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,369
What crow?

380
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:10,338
The one that flew away.

381
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:15,106
Is that all my Forest Festival stuff on the lawn?

382
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:16,736
No.

383
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:19,274
Yes.

384
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:20,816
I'll go get it.

385
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:22,643
Ow!

386
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,846
I'm all over it. Just go back to bed.

387
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:30,788
Darn it!

388
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,494
Stupid crow.

389
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,074
I get up in eight hours.

390
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,251
Shut up!

391
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,124
Oops.

392
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,561
Idiot.

393
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,602
You got to be kidding me.

394
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:40,989
I don't care. It doesn't bother me.

395
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,097
Nope.

396
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:55,642
It's on!

397
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,183
Oh.

398
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,780
Hi, there, cutie pie.

399
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:07,847
Who's the pretty birdie?

400
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:12,528
Oh, you are, aren't you? You make pretty sounds.

401
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,963
That's a nice little song you're singing.

402
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:17,932
Do you know any more?

403
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:20,231
I wonder what it would sound like

404
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:25,098
with your beak wrapped in duct tape.

405
00:32:58,842 --> 00:32:59,934
Mom,

406
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:01,975
found him.

407
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:08,447
Honey, come on, there's nothing wrong with me.

408
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:11,518
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

409
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:17,288
Dan, chasing crows onto rooftops is not what I would consider "fine."

410
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:19,693
What, exactly, are you talking about?

411
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:22,065
Tyler, Mommy and Daddy need to talk.

412
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:24,760
Right, 'cause the car has soundproof windows.

413
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:26,729
Come here.

414
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:31,472
All I am saying is I think you should take a day off

415
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:35,341
and consult a professional. You're obviously going through something.

416
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:41,781
I can't do that. I can't afford to miss another meeting with Lyman.

417
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:46,152
The guy's flying hundreds of miles out of his way just to see me.

418
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:48,715
Mr. Eco-Developer is flying hundreds of miles out of his way

419
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,317
in a private jet in order to have a meeting about eco-development?

420
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:52,419
Right.

421
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,825
Hey, that's funny.

422
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:57,924
Look, honey, just 'cause a crow kept me up all night's

423
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,468
no reason to throw in the towel.

424
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:07,933
It's gonna take a lot more than that to keep Dan Sanders from building his utopia.

425
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,985
Nature. Nature, nature, nature.

426
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:29,055
Okay, Private, on my count,

427
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:32,158
we're gonna charge up that ridge and shoot some commies.

428
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,675
Take it up to eleven!

429
00:34:41,678 --> 00:34:44,169
Three, two, one.

430
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:48,245
It's fun!

431
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:56,115
Don't bring me down

432
00:34:56,193 --> 00:35:00,152
Don't bring me down

433
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,257
Don't bring me down

434
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:08,270
Don't bring me down

435
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:15,468
You're looking good just like a snake in the grass

436
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:18,480
One of these days you're gonna break your glass

437
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:21,312
Don't bring me down

438
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:24,581
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

439
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:30,784
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor

440
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:32,886
Don't bring me down

441
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:01,387
Hello.

442
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,254
- Hi, Frank. - Mr. Sanders,

443
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:07,660
I am happy to report that everything will be ready for the investors.

444
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:10,393
Hey, can you have the guys go take a look at the electrical in the basement?

445
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:14,162
'Cause something shorted out and it could have killed me.

446
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:17,172
That's no good. I will have my boys right on that, okay?

447
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,969
- You do that. - Hey, hey, hey.

448
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,379
- What's wrong? - Well, to tell you the truth,

449
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:27,712
ever since I took this promotion, it's just been one long string of bad luck.

450
00:36:27,984 --> 00:36:29,110
No, no, no.

451
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:33,520
You know the great Ralph Waldo Emerson? You know what he said?

452
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,252
He said, "Shallow men believe in luck." Okay?

453
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:39,261
"Brave men believe in cause and effect."

454
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,353
That's profound.

455
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,022
- Yes, mister. Okay. - Okay.

456
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,205
P.U.

457
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:13,128
- Sanders, you okay? - Oh, my God, he's dead!

458
00:37:13,196 --> 00:37:15,164
- Come on. Hold on. - Move, move, move.

459
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,290
It's all locked.

460
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,194
- Open the door. - Here we go.

461
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:19,462
You all right?

462
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:23,604
- Help me! - Captain, you all right, buddy?

463
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:25,504
- It's Frank. - Unlock the door.

464
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:26,769
Captain.

465
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:29,540
Easy.

466
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:32,013
Mr. Sanders, what did you have for breakfast?

467
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:37,047
Get the hose. Get the hose, please.

468
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:45,216
Gross.

469
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:14,279
Towel. Towel.

470
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:18,987
Towel.

471
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:41,782
Holy smoke.

472
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:48,748
Oh, no. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm gonna...

473
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:51,553
This isn't what you think. You got to...

474
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:02,233
Where the heck are my clothes?

475
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:17,618
No one will see me, get in the car, get some clothes, everything will be fine.

476
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:21,646
No one will see me, get in the car, get some clothes, everything will be fine.

477
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:26,389
No one will see me, get in the car, get some clothes, everything will be fine.

478
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:30,126
Get in the car, clothes, fine. Car, clothes, fine.

479
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:37,304
Hello! Right behind you.

480
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,672
Oh, jeez, he's at it again.

481
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,415
I had it detailed and it's very, very clean.

482
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:55,024
Hey, guys. Good work on number three. Anybody see the game?

483
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:56,854
Nice fit, pound cake.

484
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,999
Get to the store, get a new suit, get to Lyman.

485
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:18,409
Frank, he did it again.

486
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:22,716
Not again. Mr. Sanders, why? Why?

487
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:31,088
Then we take the pinecone and...

488
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:36,328
We take the pinecone and...

489
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:46,570
Oh! No, I remember. I remember now.

490
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:51,380
We take the pinecones and...

491
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:54,878
And we...

492
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:02,490
Oh! Now I have it.

493
00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:06,560
We take the pinecones...

494
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:16,703
I'm sorry if this seems impersonal, sir, but I'd better stay outside the aircraft,

495
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,503
because the German measles are going around my kid's school.

496
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:21,305
We can't get a shot anywhere.

497
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,454
Yo, Petey. What up, brother?

498
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:38,784
No, no, no, dude. I am in hell here, bro.

499
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:42,495
No, seriously, I feel like I'm stuck in the Discovery Channel.

500
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,499
- Excuse me. - No, I don't get how people with half a brain

501
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,000
- could live in this town. - Excuse me.

502
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,627
I don't even think they've heard of Starbucks, man.

503
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:48,728
Excuse me.

504
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,568
Like, come on, where can a brother get some coffee?

505
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,732
Excuse me.

506
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,867
- Seriously, it's ridiculous. - Hey!

507
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:55,942
Hello.

508
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:58,608
Can I help you find something?

509
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,205
Find something?

510
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,577
I am the student librarian.

511
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:05,678
I help people find books.

512
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:09,024
I love books. Stupid.

513
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:12,527
Okay, you wanna narrow that down for me, Sanders?

514
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:14,823
Wait, how do you know my name?

515
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:18,733
Oh. I know all about you and your dad. He's the developer, right?

516
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:20,401
Yeah, that's us.

517
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,835
The tree killer.

518
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:23,270
That's us.

519
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:24,772
Mmm-hmm.

520
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:27,136
I'm Tyler.

521
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,802
Total cheeseball.

522
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,272
Amber. You're funny.

523
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:33,980
Not to mention extremely sophisticated.

524
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:39,152
Got any plans for dinner?

525
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,758
Okay.

526
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:47,754
Dan, the Indians will be here in 10 days.

527
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,391
We need to show what a truly special place Rocky Springs is.

528
00:42:52,468 --> 00:42:55,733
Thinking caps, thinking caps

529
00:42:57,774 --> 00:43:00,402
I got it. We could have

530
00:43:01,444 --> 00:43:03,309
an Indian-themed barbecue.

531
00:43:03,379 --> 00:43:04,971
What does that even mean?

532
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:07,744
Lots of things. It could mean... Oh! Instead of burgers,

533
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:09,682
we have buffalo burger!

534
00:43:09,752 --> 00:43:13,244
And we have wigwam, and teepee and squaw.

535
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:15,151
Squaw.

536
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:19,959
You were talking about the Gandhi type of Indians.

537
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:21,560
Uh-huh.

538
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:26,497
Wait, wait, we could sponsor the local Forest Festival.

539
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:31,404
Forest Festival? That's a great idea!

540
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,366
Well, you see, my wife is running it.

541
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,639
- And they're strapped for cash. - You're dead to me.

542
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:39,648
It's a great way to show the community how much we care.

543
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:44,119
Gold star, Dan. I'll call the publicist and the media.

544
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:45,654
Yes! Excellent, sir.

545
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,950
Why are you shouting at me?

546
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:54,462
No, sir, I'm not shouting at you.

547
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,998
Okay, fine, but use your inside voice.

548
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,259
Leave me alone!

549
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,969
What is his problem?

550
00:44:02,438 --> 00:44:05,066
Hey! Polly want a cracker? Polly want a cracker?

551
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:09,368
Did we not vet him? Did we do a mental status exam on him?

552
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:11,739
Mr. Lyman?

553
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,914
Are you still there, sir?

554
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:20,444
Yes, I'm still here! All right? Where's your brain?

555
00:44:21,758 --> 00:44:23,623
Sir, it's just... I'm very sorry...

556
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:27,323
Oh, dear.

557
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:33,532
I won't take up any more of your time, so I'll tell you what,

558
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:35,230
I'll pick up a budget and a proposal

559
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:37,829
and then I'll give it to you tomorrow after I huddle up with her on it.

560
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:41,508
Great! Bye!

561
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:46,072
Bees!

562
00:44:57,126 --> 00:45:00,960
Honey, I'm home, and I am the bearer of some good news.

563
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,158
Guess who met a friend today, and guess who's having dinner at...

564
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:09,403
Oh, honey, what happened to your face, Dan?

565
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,273
And why are you wearing my Yum Yum sweats?

566
00:45:12,341 --> 00:45:14,832
I had a really long day.

567
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:20,846
Gonna find you anyway... You shoddy little...

568
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:31,192
You're not fooling anyone.

569
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,921
Let me guess. The crow?

570
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,689
I found your clothes in the garbage,

571
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:39,332
- so I put them in the wash. - Thank you.

572
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:40,460
You're welcome.

573
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:44,097
I also made an appointment for you with a Dr. Burr. He's a local therapist.

574
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:47,040
Tammy, I'm fine. All I need is a good night's sleep.

575
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,910
All right, fine, I'll cancel, but one more episode and you're going.

576
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,007
This should help you sleep, however. Okay?

577
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:56,415
- What is it? - I got it from a fellow teacher at work.

578
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:03,488
"Mrs. Martin's Mushroom herbal sleepy-bye tea."

579
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:06,153
Mmm-hmm. Give it a try.

580
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,997
Mmm.

581
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,529
Okay.

582
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:31,313
Tammy.

583
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:33,815
Tammy. Tammy.

584
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:37,089
I think there's somebody downstairs.

585
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,868
Find a spot out on the floor

586
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:50,333
Ah, freak out!

587
00:46:50,406 --> 00:46:52,340
Le freak, c'est chic

588
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:53,932
Freak out!

589
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:56,577
Le freak, c'est chic

590
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:57,670
Freak out!

591
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:59,544
How did you get in here?

592
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:02,615
Freak out!

593
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:04,414
Get out of my house!

594
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:21,402
Tammy, wake up. I just had the worst nightmare.

595
00:47:34,383 --> 00:47:37,113
No banging until 7:00.

596
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,521
Oh, no.

597
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:56,103
Okay, if you don't wanna go in there, go over there.

598
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:15,515
Dan,

599
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,282
what are you doing?

600
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:20,019
Oh. Defending my home.

601
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:23,293
Okay, you need to try to explain to me what you're talking about.

602
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:25,191
Okay.

603
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:29,535
But you got to promise me, no matter how crazy this sounds,

604
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:31,332
that you'll believe me.

605
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:32,735
I promise.

606
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:34,469
Okay, here goes.

607
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:39,741
The animals are out to get me.

608
00:48:40,182 --> 00:48:42,309
And what animal are we talking about, Dan?

609
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:44,410
That's the thing. There's more than one of them.

610
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,580
There's like this whole posse of them.

611
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:49,014
I think they're in cahoots.

612
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:50,388
Cahoots?

613
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:54,520
See, you got the skunk. He's silent but deadly.

614
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,364
Then you got a crow.

615
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,930
Master of psychological warfare.

616
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:05,807
Then there's the brains of the operation, the raccoon.

617
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:10,075
Now if I take him out, the whole thing falls apart. Game over.

618
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:13,243
Well, you've done your homework, certainly.

619
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,918
- I just have one question. - What?

620
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:17,953
Are you taking crazy pills?

621
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,250
- You promised. - I take it back.

622
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:24,590
- Tyler, man the switch. - No, thanks.

623
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,993
Operation Rodent Retreat in five, four, three, two, one!

624
00:49:33,336 --> 00:49:34,769
Oh.

625
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:36,732
Tammy?

626
00:49:37,406 --> 00:49:40,671
New Day Medical. I'm sorry, he's in a session right now.

627
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:43,644
Now, I'd like to begin with some ink blots.

628
00:49:44,213 --> 00:49:46,909
Tell me what you see here.

629
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,710
First thing that comes to mind.

630
00:49:50,252 --> 00:49:52,812
Look, I know I'm not supposed to say it looks like an angry squirrel,

631
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,856
but that looks like an angry squirrel.

632
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,653
Oh, boy.

633
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,687
What about this?

634
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:03,163
An owl. An angry owl. Is this supposed to be helping?

635
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,065
All right, Dan,

636
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:11,867
how long have you been afraid of animals?

637
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:13,670
I'm not afraid of animals.

638
00:50:15,945 --> 00:50:18,505
Dan, Dan, Dan,

639
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:23,950
denial is not just a river in Egypt.

640
00:50:36,499 --> 00:50:40,697
Now, I want you to listen very carefully to what I'm gonna say to you.

641
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,595
The animals are not out to get you.

642
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:47,540
I know the animals are not out to get me.

643
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:51,771
- You do? - Yes, except for these three.

644
00:50:52,415 --> 00:50:55,316
This one does all the talking. These ones follow his orders.

645
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:56,743
Jesus.

646
00:50:57,953 --> 00:51:02,219
Dan, you're suffering from work-related stress

647
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:04,885
and we need to find your happy place.

648
00:51:05,261 --> 00:51:10,221
Now, we'll start by closing your eyes and taking a deep breath.

649
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,334
And now another deep breath.

650
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:16,594
In and out.

651
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:21,743
In and out.

652
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:31,711
In

653
00:51:32,488 --> 00:51:33,716
and out.

654
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:35,715
In

655
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:37,520
and out.

656
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,259
How do you feel?

657
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:54,234
I feel great.

658
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,302
And you're not seeing things anymore, are you?

659
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,110
No, and...

660
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:05,811
Dan?

661
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:16,431
Are you okay?

662
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:28,240
Is something out there bothering you?

663
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,806
Is it the animals?

664
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:37,208
Because you and I both know that there's nothing outside that window, right?

665
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:39,278
Dan?

666
00:52:41,423 --> 00:52:44,119
Hey, stop! That's my hybrid! Hey!

667
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:47,962
Stop, stop, stop! Come here, you!

668
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:52,094
I knew it. This is my car.

669
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,931
Get out of my car.

670
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:56,994
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! No, don't touch that... Don't...

671
00:53:02,077 --> 00:53:05,171
I'm going to crush you!

672
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:10,007
Thank you, sir, may I have another? I love it.

673
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:13,882
Get off.

674
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:19,023
Uh-oh.

675
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:22,393
Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you?

676
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:25,160
I don't have a problem with animals, even when they bite.

677
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:28,135
I like animals. Where are we going? Wait!

678
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:38,269
Ooh. That just hit the ball boy.

679
00:53:38,347 --> 00:53:41,441
- Okay, what do I do? - Okay. So, angle it up. There you go.

680
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:43,451
- Okay. - There we go.

681
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:45,544
- Okay. - And spike it! Nice.

682
00:53:45,888 --> 00:53:47,617
- Yeah. - You know, we could always play

683
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,887
- on an actual tennis court. - Yeah, but where's the fun in that?

684
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:54,759
Amber, how long have you lived up here?

685
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,663
I was born here, Mrs. Sanders.

686
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,265
Oh, really?

687
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:00,893
I love it here.

688
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:03,638
- Yeah, right. - Mrs. Sanders.

689
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,102
Now what?

690
00:54:18,988 --> 00:54:20,046
Dan?

691
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,551
Therapy went well.

692
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,089
What happened?

693
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:36,867
If you really need to know, I got carjacked by a raccoon and a skunk.

694
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:38,369
You must be Amber.

695
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,907
Yeah.

696
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:41,567
It's nice to meet you. If you'll excuse me,

697
00:54:41,644 --> 00:54:44,545
I need to remove a leech from my no-no zone.

698
00:54:45,147 --> 00:54:46,546
Oh, my God.

699
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:47,843
Bye-bye.

700
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,309
Dan.

701
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:55,757
I'm telling you, these animals are out to get me.

702
00:54:55,824 --> 00:54:56,950
I don't know why you won't believe me.

703
00:54:57,026 --> 00:54:59,722
Because it's not possible. Raccoons do not carjack SUVs.

704
00:54:59,795 --> 00:55:02,423
Well, this one did, and I will prove it to you.

705
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,075
- Hey, Tyler. - Hey, Dad.

706
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:22,550
Are you okay?

707
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,512
I think we both know that I'm way beyond okay.

708
00:55:25,587 --> 00:55:28,613
See, I got these Indian investors coming to town,

709
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:32,559
and there's a maniacal sociopathic raccoon that's been ruining my life,

710
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:35,358
but no one seems to believe that it exists.

711
00:55:36,832 --> 00:55:40,131
For whatever it's worth, I don't think you're crazy.

712
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:45,035
Amber gave me this book on local folklore.

713
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:46,131
Mmm-hmm.

714
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:48,972
I think there's something you should see.

715
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:53,441
Look, you're not the first person to ever try and settle Rocky Springs.

716
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:57,542
This area was first settled by Tookoo the Caveman in 9,000 BC.

717
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,920
Tookoo disappeared without a trace,

718
00:56:03,992 --> 00:56:06,961
and many others in history have tried and failed.

719
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:09,054
There was Sigurd the Viking.

720
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,532
Jedediah the Puritan.

721
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:17,399
We are all God's children

722
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,874
And there was Terrance the Hippie.

723
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,570
Hey, little fella.

724
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:28,816
Where are you going with this?

725
00:56:28,884 --> 00:56:31,546
Look, I did a bunch of research, okay?

726
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:35,112
It seems like your buddy, Lyman, has pretty deep pockets in Washington.

727
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,682
He got them to rezone what was supposed to be a preserved forest.

728
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:47,931
No, I don't know. I'm sure that's not the case.

729
00:56:48,003 --> 00:56:49,834
It is, okay?

730
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:53,636
You're building on a nature preserve and frankly, it's ticking nature off.

731
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:55,574
Are you telling me that the animals are trying to get me

732
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:57,373
to stop developing Rocky Springs?

733
00:56:57,446 --> 00:56:59,641
No, I think they're past that.

734
00:57:00,983 --> 00:57:03,144
I think the animals are out for revenge.

735
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:13,056
Beasty biting thing!

736
00:57:25,874 --> 00:57:27,068
Got you.

737
00:57:37,486 --> 00:57:39,784
I knew your luck would run out.

738
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:44,748
It's a setup.

739
00:57:48,597 --> 00:57:50,462
Oh, there you are.

740
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,860
Hi, little fella. This is a cute trick. Yeah.

741
00:57:56,071 --> 00:57:58,005
It's supposed to be you?

742
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:00,708
My turn now.

743
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:13,344
You're his friend.

744
00:58:49,491 --> 00:58:51,459
No, no, no.

745
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:55,353
No, no, no! No!

746
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,625
Go steal a picnic basket!

747
00:58:59,835 --> 00:59:01,826
No!

748
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:22,857
Frank, have you seen my husband this morning?

749
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:25,553
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sanders, I have not seen him.

750
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:27,686
Have you seen my toilet?

751
00:59:27,763 --> 00:59:30,357
I just don't think this can get any worse.

752
00:59:30,432 --> 00:59:32,297
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

753
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,562
- I stand corrected. - Nobody move.

754
00:59:38,674 --> 00:59:40,073
Well...

755
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:46,005
Well, well, well, well.

756
00:59:46,882 --> 00:59:48,315
Mrs. Sanders.

757
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:52,183
You have no idea where your husband is, do you?

758
00:59:52,254 --> 00:59:53,949
Guilty as charged.

759
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:59,184
You know, I'm getting a little tired of your dumb-dumb show

760
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:01,752
and your poppycocks and your jiggery...

761
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:05,693
- I don't want you to speak anymore. - Don't do that.

762
01:00:05,767 --> 01:00:07,735
- I found him. - Dan.

763
01:00:08,337 --> 01:00:09,929
Oh.

764
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,236
Where?

765
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:20,176
- You have got to be kidding me. - Hello?

766
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:24,242
Dan? Dan, honey, are you in there?

767
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,549
Does anyone have some Purell?

768
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:30,282
Don't worry, Mr. Sanders, we'll have you down in no time.

769
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:35,225
Sooner than you think.

770
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:36,757
Come on.

771
01:00:37,165 --> 01:00:38,860
You might wanna cover your eyes.

772
01:00:42,804 --> 01:00:44,271
Get the hose.

773
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,568
- Tammy? - Fire!

774
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:05,918
- Are you okay, boss? - Yeah, yeah, real good.

775
01:01:05,994 --> 01:01:07,985
Nothing like a cold shower to wake you up in the morning.

776
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:12,098
So you guys are making really good progress on unit three,

777
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,192
and I was thinking about laying some pipe right about...

778
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:18,401
You are mine.

779
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,634
Dan.

780
01:01:26,314 --> 01:01:28,578
This ends now.

781
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:36,222
I don't know where he thinks he's going without my keys,

782
01:01:41,463 --> 01:01:44,193
Unless I left them in the car.

783
01:01:59,548 --> 01:02:01,311
Let's end this now.

784
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:05,413
Ready,

785
01:02:08,457 --> 01:02:09,549
aim,

786
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:13,691
aim again.

787
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,232
I can't do it. I'm not a killer.

788
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:27,835
Come on, can't we just figure this out?

789
01:02:39,955 --> 01:02:42,389
I was trying to make this work, and you...

790
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:54,293
Now, you look here! I've got...

791
01:03:17,592 --> 01:03:19,059
Bull's eye.

792
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:25,530
Lucky for you, I got LoJack.

793
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,328
Is it dead?

794
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,804
No, just shot him with my tankalizer gun.

795
01:03:31,873 --> 01:03:34,034
He's just taking a tankalizer-gun nap.

796
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:36,441
How many more of these things have you got?

797
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:39,571
I got a whole warehouse stocked down in Harrison. Why?

798
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:41,710
What are you thinking?

799
01:03:41,783 --> 01:03:43,375
I'm thinking about

800
01:03:44,786 --> 01:03:46,083
cleaning house.

801
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,622
Tree skunk.

802
01:03:54,229 --> 01:03:55,958
They live in the hollers.

803
01:03:56,298 --> 01:04:00,598
It's a beautiful morning

804
01:04:03,438 --> 01:04:05,030
Bring them in, boys!

805
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:07,909
Put those possums on the top.

806
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:09,409
- All right. - Yeah.

807
01:04:10,612 --> 01:04:12,443
And watch out for them ferrets.

808
01:04:14,216 --> 01:04:16,946
No sense in staying inside

809
01:04:17,018 --> 01:04:22,081
If the weather's fine and you got the time

810
01:04:22,157 --> 01:04:27,026
It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day

811
01:04:27,095 --> 01:04:28,119
Either way

812
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:30,790
It's a beautiful morning

813
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:36,526
Stack them high, boys. Stack them high. Hey!

814
01:04:37,138 --> 01:04:40,266
Not so tough, are we now, Mr. Tom Turkey?

815
01:04:46,414 --> 01:04:48,473
- Morning, Mr. Sanders. - Morning, guys.

816
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,313
Not a raccoon in sight.

817
01:04:53,855 --> 01:04:56,756
It just ain't no good if the sun shines

818
01:04:56,825 --> 01:04:58,156
When you're still inside

819
01:04:58,226 --> 01:05:00,126
- Shouldn't hide - Still inside

820
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:02,527
- Shouldn't hide - Still inside

821
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:14,073
You know, with our animals locked up and under control,

822
01:05:14,142 --> 01:05:16,406
I think we could speed up phase two by several months.

823
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:17,502
That would be correct.

824
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:20,480
- Mind if I join you? - Please. Do sit down.

825
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:24,612
Thank you. So, Dan said you wanted to go over a few of the festival details.

826
01:05:24,686 --> 01:05:27,814
Well, first of all, Tammy, I mean, you've done a fantastic job.

827
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:28,913
Thank you.

828
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,617
I just have a few tweaks.

829
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:32,216
Tweaks, tweaks.

830
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:36,993
Our current plans for the festival, well, they're depressing.

831
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:38,089
Huh?

832
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,828
And this whole thing about pollution and the trees.

833
01:05:44,272 --> 01:05:47,799
Please. If my Indian investors wanna be reminded about pollution,

834
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:49,434
they'll stay home in Calcutta.

835
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:50,773
Stink-o.

836
01:05:51,379 --> 01:05:54,348
Well, what do you want me to do? Get eco-go-go dancers?

837
01:05:54,883 --> 01:05:56,282
Great idea. Jot that down.

838
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:57,648
Write this down.

839
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:00,319
Hey, Mom, you owe me 25 bucks.

840
01:06:00,388 --> 01:06:03,380
Yeah, ma, 25 bucks. Stupid!

841
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:16,498
Wait up. Wait. Stop. Stop.

842
01:06:19,774 --> 01:06:20,968
You holding up?

843
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:23,704
You kidding? I love cross-country running.

844
01:06:24,479 --> 01:06:26,674
Well, come on, we only got 10 more miles.

845
01:06:27,115 --> 01:06:28,377
Awesome.

846
01:06:32,287 --> 01:06:35,450
Hey, so, how's your dad? He feeling better?

847
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:39,119
Much. Yeah, I really think he's turned a corner.

848
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:41,790
Look, I know you see him as

849
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:45,629
Mr. Evil-Let's-Develop-The-Ozone And-Destroy-The-Rain-Forest guy,

850
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,691
but he really means well.

851
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:52,535
Look, I don't think your dad's a bad guy. I just don't like what they're doing.

852
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:57,378
Well, they are sponsoring the festival. That has to count for something.

853
01:06:57,779 --> 01:06:59,303
Well, yeah.

854
01:07:03,118 --> 01:07:04,949
Amber, is everything okay?

855
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,012
Yeah, you know,

856
01:07:07,922 --> 01:07:11,585
I was just thinking about midterms,

857
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,560
my allowance, when you were gonna get up the guts to kiss me.

858
01:07:31,212 --> 01:07:32,941
Is everything okay?

859
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:50,090
Hello?

860
01:07:56,838 --> 01:07:59,807
- I knew it. - No, no, This has to be a mistake.

861
01:07:59,874 --> 01:08:02,069
Really? 'Cause it makes perfect sense to me.

862
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:05,175
God, the things people do for a dollar.

863
01:08:05,814 --> 01:08:07,941
- Amber, wait up. - Just leave me alone.

864
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:09,415
Don't lump me in with my dad.

865
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:11,111
Kind of hard not to.

866
01:08:14,122 --> 01:08:15,487
Thanks, Dad.

867
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,224
- Keep it straight. Easy. - Okay, I am.

868
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:22,252
Good job with the Moon Bounce, guys. Put the Ferris wheel over here.

869
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:24,821
Yeah, I got it. I got it. Just give me a minute, okay?

870
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:28,892
Dan, we've got to do something. Your boss is ruining the whole festival.

871
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:29,994
Tammy, it's not that bad.

872
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:32,562
Yeah, it is. It's going against everything it's meant to be.

873
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,107
It's a disaster. It's embarrassing.

874
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:37,303
Calm down, will you? What do you want me to do, Tammy? He's my boss.

875
01:08:40,148 --> 01:08:42,480
- So, were you ever gonna tell me? - Tell you what?

876
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,415
About your four-legged prison.

877
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:46,586
Oh.

878
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:48,588
It's not what you think it is, all right?

879
01:08:48,656 --> 01:08:51,853
It's just for a couple of days until the investors leave and then...

880
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:53,018
Then what?

881
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:56,188
Well, we let the animals free and everything's fine,

882
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:57,628
and you know what?

883
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:00,600
They're probably a little bit better off right now because they're safe.

884
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:01,794
Wow!

885
01:09:02,971 --> 01:09:05,132
You are so blind to the facts.

886
01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:06,798
You work for a green company

887
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,400
and you're signing orders to cage little animals.

888
01:09:09,477 --> 01:09:11,468
You're such a hypocrite.

889
01:09:15,383 --> 01:09:16,475
- Hey, Tyler. - No, Mom.

890
01:09:16,584 --> 01:09:18,051
Wait a minute.

891
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:21,954
What, I'm the bad guy?

892
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,984
Oh, come on. No.

893
01:09:51,986 --> 01:09:53,886
Well, I hope it was worth it.

894
01:09:55,123 --> 01:09:57,785
You know, my family has completely turned against me.

895
01:09:59,594 --> 01:10:02,154
Why me? What did I ever do to you?

896
01:10:04,098 --> 01:10:08,330
Great, I'm trying to get sympathy from a raccoon. Like you'd understand.

897
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:12,697
Found your kids.

898
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:23,611
You have a family.

899
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:31,850
All this time, you were protecting them from me.

900
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:04,155
Hold still, Beatrice.

901
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:06,687
There!

902
01:11:07,996 --> 01:11:09,588
Way to go, Cooper!

903
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:11,354
Pickle hit!

904
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:13,063
Come on, come on.

905
01:11:13,134 --> 01:11:16,695
Stinky loves pickles! Stinky loves pickles!

906
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:19,468
Once we break ground on phase two,

907
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:22,373
Dan here will be able to build a dozen residential areas,

908
01:11:22,443 --> 01:11:24,502
which will all be gated communities.

909
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:30,145
All right, be strong.

910
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:32,610
Stop developments in Rocky Springs!

911
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:34,915
Keep our forest green!

912
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:36,746
Sign the petition.

913
01:11:37,558 --> 01:11:39,549
Stop development in Rocky Springs.

914
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:40,992
Hi, Mr. Houston.

915
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:43,360
You, take one. It's really important.

916
01:11:43,431 --> 01:11:45,365
Amber! Amber!

917
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:46,491
What?

918
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:47,864
What are you doing?

919
01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:50,870
Gandhi said to be the change that you want to see in the world.

920
01:11:50,938 --> 01:11:53,998
Well, did Gandhi ever talk about you not returning my phone calls

921
01:11:54,075 --> 01:11:55,508
or my text messages?

922
01:11:55,576 --> 01:11:59,068
Well, excuse me, I've been a little busy trying to stop your dad.

923
01:11:59,147 --> 01:12:01,775
You know what? If you're gonna do something, then do it right.

924
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:04,541
Tyler. Tyler.

925
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:15,685
Stop the development of Rocky Springs! Sign our petition and keep our forest green!

926
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:17,525
Show-off.

927
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:18,895
Now if we use solar energy,

928
01:12:18,966 --> 01:12:21,867
we can raise rental prices at least 10% over market value

929
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:25,565
while generating free publicity for being economically conscious.

930
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,301
Speaking of economically conscious,

931
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:30,310
Dan's wife, and our festival coordinator, Tammy Sanders.

932
01:12:30,378 --> 01:12:32,972
- Tammy. - Thank you. I'm proud.

933
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:36,483
The first Forest Festival that has nothing to do with the forest.

934
01:12:36,551 --> 01:12:38,212
That's not true.

935
01:12:38,286 --> 01:12:39,310
Dad!

936
01:12:39,387 --> 01:12:41,719
Oh, and this is Dan's son, Tyler.

937
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:43,017
How's it going, kids?

938
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:45,355
Yeah, we're trying to stop the reckless development of the forest

939
01:12:45,426 --> 01:12:46,984
by Lyman Enterprises.

940
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:49,791
Funny. Kids these days.

941
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:52,162
Tyler, I know you must be very angry with me right now...

942
01:12:52,233 --> 01:12:55,691
- Look, this has nothing to do with you, Dad. - The animals are gonna be killed.

943
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,499
Killed? No.

944
01:12:58,072 --> 01:13:01,337
There must be some sort of communication breakdown.

945
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:04,909
Lyman Industries, we don't kill animals. We're just going to relocate them.

946
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:06,503
Yeah, but that's just the same as killing them.

947
01:13:06,581 --> 01:13:07,775
I mean, you can't just relocate animals.

948
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,043
Enough.

949
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:12,046
I've heard all I need to hear.

950
01:13:12,687 --> 01:13:15,053
Lyman, you got a deal.

951
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:16,789
- What? - What?

952
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:18,252
What about the animals?

953
01:13:18,326 --> 01:13:20,385
Less animals, less hassle.

954
01:13:20,795 --> 01:13:22,854
- Let's get rid of them. - What?

955
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,558
Great, I'll call business affairs. We'll get the contracts here.

956
01:13:25,633 --> 01:13:27,692
Do you have a fax machine, something?

957
01:13:31,072 --> 01:13:32,767
- So now we're killing animals? - Hey, I...

958
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,172
Congratulations. Well done, Dad.

959
01:13:35,243 --> 01:13:38,576
Wait. I thought that relocating the animals wouldn't be a problem...

960
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:43,576
I'm gonna go take care of our son.

961
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:48,551
- Where are you going? - There's something I've got to do.

962
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,751
I'll do what I can to create a diversion,

963
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:58,992
so what I want you to do is get your families and get out of here.

964
01:13:59,066 --> 01:14:00,795
All right? Good luck.

965
01:14:23,057 --> 01:14:27,585
Darling, over here! Look at the camera. Darling. Say cheese, darling.

966
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:30,893
Come on. Come on, honey. Come on, look over here.

967
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:34,128
Show me your punim, honey. Come on, look over here.

968
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:38,228
That's a very large owl.

969
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:02,060
All right! All right, freeze!

970
01:15:04,031 --> 01:15:06,864
Oh. Oh, there's a lot of you.

971
01:15:08,736 --> 01:15:10,101
Don't freak out.

972
01:15:11,305 --> 01:15:13,296
Freaking out!

973
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:19,407
How about a hand for the band, ladies and...

974
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:23,709
Friends and...

975
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:25,882
It's broken. It's broken.

976
01:15:29,624 --> 01:15:30,818
Hayseed.

977
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:35,652
Friends and neighbors, my name is Neil Lyman,

978
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:38,528
and on behalf of Lyman Enterprises,

979
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,460
it has been a privilege to be a part of your little community.

980
01:15:42,637 --> 01:15:45,037
Today... Thank you. Thank you.

981
01:15:45,106 --> 01:15:49,270
Today marks a new beginning for this little town of yours.

982
01:15:49,577 --> 01:15:51,704
Some have called it backwater.

983
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:53,906
- Some have called it irrelevant. - Irrelevant?

984
01:15:53,981 --> 01:15:55,812
Two-teeth maximum.

985
01:15:55,883 --> 01:15:59,182
But I see your little corner of nature for what it could be,

986
01:15:59,987 --> 01:16:02,114
a center for a new suburbia.

987
01:16:03,424 --> 01:16:04,686
Thank you.

988
01:16:05,259 --> 01:16:06,419
Thank you.

989
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:11,092
With me today is a great man

990
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:14,267
who will change your little world.

991
01:16:15,236 --> 01:16:18,000
So, without further ado...

992
01:16:18,506 --> 01:16:20,804
Stop the development of Rocky Springs.

993
01:16:21,442 --> 01:16:24,275
Stop the development of Rocky Springs.

994
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,844
My son, Tyler, here,

995
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:31,451
he was right.

996
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:33,209
You were right.

997
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:36,418
This man's a fraud.

998
01:16:37,191 --> 01:16:38,920
He's not eco-friendly.

999
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:41,261
He's not even friendly.

1000
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:44,457
All right. That's a little below the belt, okay?

1001
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:48,226
I forced my family to move here.

1002
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:53,563
I said it was for the fresh air, for them to have a better life.

1003
01:16:58,579 --> 01:17:01,241
I was just trying to further my career.

1004
01:17:03,851 --> 01:17:08,015
I came here because I thought that I was building a community,

1005
01:17:08,089 --> 01:17:09,647
but the truth is

1006
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:12,482
I was just stealing one.

1007
01:17:13,661 --> 01:17:15,754
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.

1008
01:17:16,063 --> 01:17:17,428
I'm sorry.

1009
01:17:20,067 --> 01:17:23,059
Sorry about this. Security. Security, please.

1010
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:27,401
Okay, what if I told you people I was about to pour in

1011
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:30,876
$100 million into the local economy?

1012
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:32,742
Who's friendly now, huh?

1013
01:17:32,813 --> 01:17:34,838
Who's friendly now?

1014
01:17:34,982 --> 01:17:37,883
- Don't listen to him. - Mr. Sanders.

1015
01:17:41,822 --> 01:17:44,382
Okay, folks. All right, nothing to see here.

1016
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:48,189
Let's not let a few rotten apples spoil a great time, all right?

1017
01:17:48,262 --> 01:17:52,221
So, Mr. Gupta, if you will kindly take my pen.

1018
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,529
Drum roll, please.

1019
01:18:03,277 --> 01:18:05,074
Is that all you got?

1020
01:18:15,756 --> 01:18:17,383
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

1021
01:18:19,493 --> 01:18:22,462
- Okay. Sign, sir. - I'm not signing this.

1022
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:27,595
Do it.

1023
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:28,692
- No. - Do it.

1024
01:18:28,769 --> 01:18:30,566
- I don't want to do it. - I don't care!

1025
01:18:30,638 --> 01:18:32,037
- Fine. - Good.

1026
01:18:33,774 --> 01:18:34,866
Okay.

1027
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,405
Drum roll, please.

1028
01:18:45,686 --> 01:18:46,948
Now what?

1029
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:58,093
Purkles.

1030
01:18:58,599 --> 01:18:59,657
Look!

1031
01:19:05,372 --> 01:19:07,670
It is raccoon.

1032
01:19:25,559 --> 01:19:28,392
- Sweet pea. - You complete me!

1033
01:19:56,223 --> 01:19:58,885
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1034
01:19:58,959 --> 01:20:00,290
My contract!

1035
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:04,663
- Now do you believe me? - I will never doubt you again!

1036
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:13,433
I remember our first Forest Festival.

1037
01:20:13,507 --> 01:20:14,974
Amber! Amber!

1038
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:30,683
Get off. Move. Get off!

1039
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:31,884
I got the key.

1040
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:33,984
- Look, Brad Pitt. - Where?

1041
01:20:35,696 --> 01:20:36,822
I got it!

1042
01:20:36,997 --> 01:20:42,697
So I started this business, oh, years ago,

1043
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:45,000
way, way back when you were just an egg.

1044
01:21:10,164 --> 01:21:11,426
Tammy!

1045
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:15,695
Goodbye, raccoon.

1046
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:25,912
It was an accident. Oh, my God!

1047
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:29,815
The deal is...

1048
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:33,581
No, it's not off! No!

1049
01:21:47,568 --> 01:21:48,592
We're good.

1050
01:21:49,103 --> 01:21:50,730
It's right here, right here.

1051
01:21:51,772 --> 01:21:55,264
"Mr. Gupta." Good, good, good, good. Good enough.

1052
01:21:55,342 --> 01:21:57,003
Deal! Sweet dreams.

1053
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:03,980
This is not what you think.

1054
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:07,051
Hey!

1055
01:22:07,888 --> 01:22:10,584
Dan, I'll be right back.

1056
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:18,321
Bruce Lee from the grave.

1057
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:21,025
So long, suckers.

1058
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,099
So long, suckers.

1059
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:45,656
You ain't so bad. You ain't so tough.

1060
01:22:46,026 --> 01:22:48,494
There's a bear driving a golf cart.

1061
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:49,859
Doing a good job, too.

1062
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:51,363
Put that tail down.

1063
01:22:52,633 --> 01:22:54,066
That's gross.

1064
01:22:59,173 --> 01:23:01,641
Can I just say that I'm really sorry?

1065
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:05,406
I got my priorities completely out of order,

1066
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:10,209
and I love you, Tyler.

1067
01:23:10,284 --> 01:23:12,650
Dad. Dad, not cool, okay?

1068
01:23:13,087 --> 01:23:14,987
Tyler, tell your father that you love him.

1069
01:23:15,055 --> 01:23:16,249
- What? - Do it.

1070
01:23:16,323 --> 01:23:18,257
- Do it. Do it. Do it now. - Tyler.

1071
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:19,724
Tell him.

1072
01:23:19,793 --> 01:23:20,919
Tyler.

1073
01:23:21,261 --> 01:23:23,320
- I love you, Dad. - Come on, say it.

1074
01:23:23,397 --> 01:23:24,386
Hmm?

1075
01:23:24,498 --> 01:23:26,796
- I love you, too, Dad. - Oh, you do.

1076
01:23:28,669 --> 01:23:30,796
- I love you, too. - I love you.

1077
01:23:34,074 --> 01:23:36,167
Hey, your parents are right there.

1078
01:23:37,311 --> 01:23:39,472
Are we gonna be all right?

1079
01:23:41,915 --> 01:23:43,940
We're gonna be just fine.

1080
01:24:22,623 --> 01:24:25,217
Now, this is a pinecone,

1081
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:28,125
and I'm painting it for Christmas.

1082
01:24:28,195 --> 01:24:30,561
So you can hang it on your door,

1083
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:33,932
in case you ever have a door.

1084
01:24:34,535 --> 01:24:38,835
Who you trying to get crazy with, ese? Don't you know I'm loco?

1085
01:24:55,522 --> 01:24:57,820
To the one on the flamboyant tip

1086
01:24:57,891 --> 01:25:00,860
I'll just toss that ham in the fryin' pan like spam

1087
01:25:00,928 --> 01:25:02,725
It's done when I come and slam

1088
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:05,094
Yeah, let me tell you who I am

1089
01:25:05,165 --> 01:25:07,497
Don't make me spell it Watch me get reckless

1090
01:25:07,568 --> 01:25:09,866
Burning up the track like I was electric

1091
01:25:09,937 --> 01:25:12,462
Damn, the lights are blinkin', I'm thinkin'

1092
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:14,530
It's all over when your brain starts shrinkin'

1093
01:25:14,608 --> 01:25:16,872
Oh, makin' my mind slow

1094
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:19,242
But I can't stop when my body says go

1095
01:25:19,313 --> 01:25:21,304
Bro, I gotta maintain

1096
01:25:21,381 --> 01:25:24,316
'Cause a freak like me is goin' insane

1097
01:25:24,384 --> 01:25:26,750

You know I rhyme like no other Now it's time for the blubber

1106
01:25:45,172 --> 01:25:47,436
Blabber, watch that belly get fatter

1107
01:25:47,508 --> 01:25:49,806
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it

1108
01:25:49,877 --> 01:25:52,175
Steppin' to me is like steppin' to a giant

1109
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:54,237
Much too fast like a sumo

1110
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:56,805
Hitting that mat Leaving your face in the grass

1111
01:25:56,884 --> 01:25:59,250
You know, I don't take this thing lightly

1112
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:01,583
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me

1113
01:26:01,655 --> 01:26:03,919
So kick that style, wicked, wild

1114

01:31:02,889 --> 01:31:05,221
Who's friendly now?
