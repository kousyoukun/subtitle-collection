1
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:15,485
I do as I please!

2
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,383
Oh, hey, what do we got here?

3
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,349
You got Riggs.

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,276
Hey, Neil.

5
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,290
I just scouted it.

6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,022
How is it?

7
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:39,845
It's a gold mine!

8
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:45,885
Yeah, once we gut the forest, baby,
you got prime-A real estate, I'm telling you.

9
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,725
Sanders? I don't know.
My men say he's doing fine,

10
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,103
but I plan on swinging by tomorrow
and letting him know

11
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,958
that I'll be taking over operations.

12
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,770
Hello? Mr. Lyman?

13
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:58,174
Hello?

14
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:04,422
Give a hoot, don't pollute.

15
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,145
Whatever.

16
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:15,208
Oh, what's this?
Out of the way, fuzzball.

17
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,786
You got to the count of three,
little man. One...

18
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,732
That was awesome.

19
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,089
No, put that down.

20
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:51,655
Ha, ha. Very funny. Bad raccoon.

21
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:54,732
Bad, bad, raccoon.

22
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,826
Mr. Lyman, I quit!

23
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:41,670
Nature.

24
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,844
Look alive, people, the capitán on deck.

25
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:57,293
Morning, Frank.
Men seem to be making good progress.

26
00:04:57,582 --> 00:05:00,898
There's nothing like having the boss
living on site. Duck.

27
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:03,014
I have a question, you have the answer.

28
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,580
That's the way you get things done
around here.

29
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,115
These past few months
have been a blessing for me.

30
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,717
Look out, there.

31
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,030
Hop.

32
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:12,936
So, good progress on unit number five.

33
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:15,854
I don't know if I can say the same thing
about number three.

34
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:17,292
It's the beaver dam.

35
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,813
It's a good one, too.
It's blocking the drainage about 30 yards in.

36
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,064
How long's that gonna set us back?

37
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:22,083
- There we go.
- Back.

38
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:25,254
Well, you want me to keep the beaver dam?
You're looking at a week.

39
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:28,294
If not, we can bust it up.
The beavers, they're not home.

40
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:32,014
I don't know. We're a green company, Frank.

41
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,052
I can make it look like an accident.

42
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,282
Oops. I accidentally left a stick of dynamite
inside the beaver dam.

43
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,560
I don't know. I don't want to rock the boat
before Mr. Lyman gets here.

44
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:49,032
So, tell you what. Why don't you work up
some numbers, get back to me?

45
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:52,038
Hey, while you're at it,
pull the boys off of number three

46
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:54,599
and get them started on the plumbing
on number five.

47
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:56,974
You heard the captain!
We're moving on to five!

48
00:05:58,097 --> 00:05:59,471
- Really?
- Great.

49
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,171
Psst! Shoo!

50
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:11,367
Those are my blueberries.

51
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,132
Hear it coming
I know you feel it

52
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:39,470
We both got it
No need to steal it

53
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,318
Nature.

54
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,542
Don't mind much
Maybe not today

55
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:49,031
In your heart
Can't wish it all away

56
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,625
Fight for it
Careful what you say

57
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:56,081
- Homesick much?
- I'm working on it.

58
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:01,518
Whatever you want
We got it all!

59
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,409
Rise and shine, Tyler-iffic.

60
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:09,008
First day of school.

61
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:16,460
Yeah, yeah
Let's go home

62
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,843
Let's go home

63
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,010
What's that, fatty? You gonna cry?

64
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:27,049
Take it up to seven with an incline of five
on the double!

65
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,089
And no cheating!

66
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,024
Yeah, yeah, yeah

67
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,195
We got it all!

68
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,465
- Morning, honey.
- Morning, sweetie.

69
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:53,710
So, what's new in the world?

70
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,168
Well, crime rate's going up in Chicago.

71
00:07:56,243 --> 00:08:00,367
See? That's another thing to be grateful for.
No crime here. Nothing but peace and quiet.

72
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,625
- That is temporary.
- Mmm-hmm.

73
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,335
Oh, Dan, wild turkeys. Wild turkeys.

74
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:12,203
Dan, stop. Hey.
You can't eat that in front of them.

75
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,217
Put it down. It could be their mom.

76
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,194
How do they know it's turkey bacon
and not bacon-bacon?

77
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:24,137
They have a sixth sense. Put it down.

78
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:28,625
Hey, honey. How'd you sleep?

79
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:32,972
Not good. I had this awful nightmare
that my insensitive parents uprooted me

80
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:36,012
from my wonderful home
and dumped me in the middle of nowhere.

81
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:40,750
He just misses his friends.

82
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,609
How can he miss his friends?
He spent the whole summer

83
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:45,579
cooped up in his room
talking to them online with his computer.

84
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,246
He knows the deal, all right?

85
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,684
We're here for a year,
and then we go back to Chicago.

86
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:51,058
Maybe you should talk to him.

87
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:53,807
What for?
That'll just irritate him more.

88
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:56,333
Dan, you're his dad. Try.

89
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:05,299
So, Tyler, care to join me outside
for some fresh mountain air?

90
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:09,867
Come on, Tyler, I bet there's probably
some really cute girls at your school.

91
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,632
And they really dig your hip city vibe.

92
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:14,963
Yeah. I bet you're right.
I bet there are some cute girls out there.

93
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,484
- There you go.
- You know what else there are?

94
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,412
Poisonous rattlesnakes!

95
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:22,097
Yeah, they're all over the forest.

96
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:23,889
I'm gonna end up like this guy.

97
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,725
All right, you win.
I'll quit my job, we pack up the car

98
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:30,100
and we go back to Chicago.
Would that make you happy?

99
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,693
Don't answer that question.

100
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,092
- No, no, no. Don't touch.
- What?

101
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,303
For my boss.

102
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,513
- All of them?
- Yeah, all 38 of them.

103
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:41,619
- I don't know what kind he likes.
- Seriously?

104
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,299
Hey, are we cool?

105
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:46,032
Yeah, never better.

106
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:47,694
Great.

107
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,216
Johanna drove slowly into the city

108
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:25,970
The Hudson River all filled with snow

109
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,756
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger

110
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:36,467
A thousand years in one piece of silver

111
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,121
She took it from his lily-white hand

112
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:41,461
Showed no fear
She'd seen the thing

113
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,081
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

114
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:45,231
Have a good one.

115
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,200
- Three months down.
- And nine to go.

116
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,319
Yeah.

117
00:10:57,752 --> 00:11:01,069
Look outside
The raincoats coming, say "Oh"

118
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:06,320
Look outside
The raincoats coming, say "Oh"

119
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,637
$50,000 for the overage on a beaver dam?

120
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:19,280
You're sure the beavers aren't home?

121
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:25,720
All right, just take care of it.

122
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,021
Make it look like an accident.
I'll call you later, Frank.

123
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,354
Johanna drove slowly into the city

124
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,977
The Hudson River all filled with snow

125
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:39,798
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger

126
00:11:57,337 --> 00:12:00,372
Mr. Lyman, welcome to Rocky Springs.

127
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:02,447
Hey, Dan.

128
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:07,608
Hope we didn't keep you waiting.
Just bought the plane yesterday

129
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:09,648
and wanted to see
how she handled warp factor two.

130
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,363
And this is for your son.

131
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,976
Oh, thank you. That's really very kind of you.

132
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,993
He's going on four, right?

133
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,512
No, actually, he's gonna be 16 next month.

134
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:26,067
- No.
- No, memo says four. You sure?

135
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:28,528
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

136
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:38,351
Actually, no, the toy's...

137
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:42,992
- Excuse me?
- The toy is great and he's gonna love it.

138
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,856
- Isn't it crazy how time flies?
- Isn't it?

139
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,647
- I have two kids of my own.
- Three.

140
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,145
Three, and I remember when

141
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,714
- what's-his-name and...
- Tony.

142
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:50,867
...John and...
- Yoko Junior.

143
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:52,564
...were just babies.

144
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,523
- Memories.
- They're my kids.

145
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,986
So, I got the car here.

146
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:00,757
I brought some sandwiches
and it's about an hour to the site.

147
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:03,064
An hour? Both ways?

148
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,654
Two hours round-trip.

149
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,059
I don't think so.

150
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,685
Sandwiches? Gross.

151
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,192
Now just be sure to check
your curriculums carefully.

152
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,537
The board is very strict about
no child being left behind. Capisce?

153
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:36,242
Okay, first things first.
I'd like to give a warm welcome

154
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,869
to our brand new science teacher,

155
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:41,876
Tammy, from Chicago.

156
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:45,684
Now, as I'm sure many of you already know,

157
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:50,009
one of our math teachers, Mr. Bowen,
is out sick for the rest of the year,

158
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:54,682
so we find ourselves without a chairman
for the Forest Festival.

159
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:58,228
Either one of you volunteers,
or I say we just junk it.

160
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:01,717
But we've always had a Forest Festival.

161
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:05,466
The children love painting the pinecones

162
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:08,829
and playing "Mother May I?"
With Bessie the Cow.

163
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:11,741
Claire, Bessie the Cow
was put down in 1972.

164
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:15,734
That's nice. Nice.

165
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:18,840
Bessie the Cow, Bessie the Cow

166
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,724
Isn't tenure wonderful?

167
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,959
Will you ever retire?

168
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:27,222
Excuse me, I...

169
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:29,912
- That's so great! We have a volunteer.
- No, I...

170
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:33,626
Tammy Sanders is officially in charge
of the Forest Festival.

171
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:35,668
Yay, Tammy.

172
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,452
We're gonna have so much fun.

173
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:42,675
Bessie the Cow, Bessie the Cow

174
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,725
Bessie jumped over the moon

175
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,878
Oh, boy.

176
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:49,844
Click. Page down, page down, page down,
page down, page down. Page up.

177
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,011
As you can see from the photographs here,

178
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:55,805
we are 16% under budget.

179
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:57,245
Good, good.

180
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:00,312
Which I'm very pleased about,
because at this rate,

181
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:04,922
we are going to be completed
with the construction by March.

182
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,649
- Guaranteed.
- That's great.

183
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:08,855
Now you'll be ready for phase two.

184
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:10,039
Oh.

185
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,918
Sorry, what's phase two?

186
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,457
Show him the plans.

187
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:18,870
All right. You are in charge of phase one,
which is this right now.

188
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:22,173
- Right.
- And this is phase two.

189
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:27,768
So you're just gonna take out
the whole forest?

190
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:28,853
Yeah.

191
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,160
Mmm?

192
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:33,332
Huh?

193
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:39,901
But we're replacing it with a shopping mall
with a forest theme.

194
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:42,870
Dan, do you know why they call me
"The King of Green"?

195
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:44,471
Because I love this planet.

196
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:48,153
Unfortunately, I have to deal
with these eco-hypocrites.

197
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,842
They say they want to save
the planet, but only if it's convenient.

198
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:53,694
You ever notice that? They always drink
venti latte with recycled cups,

199
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,768
and all of a sudden
they're part of the solution?

200
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:57,913
What I need from you
isn't a commitment to green,

201
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:00,123
but a grasp of the shades of gray.

202
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,872
I understand.

203
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:06,491
Great. So you'll be heading up phase two
for the next four years.

204
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,793
Four years?

205
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:13,212
Sir, I relocated my family here for one year.

206
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:15,736
Yeah, that was until
Riggs disappeared on me.

207
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,697
My wife and my... My son are...

208
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:19,419
Oh, God.

209
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:22,718
Dan, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for you.

210
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:25,151
I'll double your salary. Think about it.

211
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,208
You have 10 seconds
or I'm pulling the offer.

212
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:30,394
Ten,

213
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,472
nine-eight-seven-six-five-four
three-two-one!

214
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,912
All right, I'll do it.

215
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,185
You're doing the right thing, Dan.

216
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,017
Oh, no, you're crazy. What?

217
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,662
- Felder.
- Okay, big guy, this meeting's over.

218
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:49,210
Hold on for a second, Mom.
Just let me... What?

219
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:51,036
Bye-bye.

220
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:02,365
My wife is going to kill me.

221
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:06,976
Dan, we're a family, all right?
We make decisions together.

222
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:11,233
Look, it's not such a bad thing.
Think of it as a promotion.

223
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:15,161
Yeah. If anybody needs me,
I'll be at a friend's house.

224
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:18,687
Oh! Oh, wait, I don't have any friends here.

225
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:20,609
Look, guys,

226
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:24,279
this is an opportunity
to do something good for our family

227
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,079
and for the environment, too.

228
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:29,180
How is ripping out the forest
good for the environment?

229
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,266
It's not like that.

230
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:32,673
We're Lyman Enterprises.
We're the good guys. We're green.

231
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,976
Yeah, as in the color of money.

232
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:39,102
And speaking of money.
Who wants a new Wii? Huh?

233
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:31,747
Oh, come on.

234
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,430
Birds.

235
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:47,612
Hey.

236
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,051
You, go away.

237
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:12,549
Hey, guys, can we just take a look
at the sprinkler system?

238
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:14,501
No problem, Mr. Sanders.

239
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:17,597
Hi.

240
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,812
Check out Mr. Pee-Pee Pants.

241
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:24,545
Just had a little problem with a raccoon.

242
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,801
Well, that's funny.
He must have scampered off.

243
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,274
Hilarious.

244
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,005
Are you still mad at me?

245
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,597
What do you think?

246
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,704
Well, excuse me
for caring about the environment.

247
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:47,359
Hello, jefe.
The beaver dam problem is gone. Yes. Yes!

248
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:51,238
Oh. Blowing up beavers, are we?

249
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:52,613
They weren't home.

250
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:54,501
Well, that was eco-friendly of you.

251
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:59,206
- Let go
- Let go

252
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:00,930
- Give in
- Give in

253
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,429
- Give up
- Give up

254
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:03,998
- Surrender
- Surrender

255
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:05,795
- Let go
- Let go

256
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:07,456
- Give in
- Give in

257
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:08,956
- Give up
- Give up

258
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,374
- Surrender
- Surrender

259
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,281
Hello, sir.

260
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:14,846
Dan, Neil Lyman.

261
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:19,714
Listen, our plane got in early.
I was thinking about scouting the site.

262
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,093
Oh, jeez!

263
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,874
How's everything on your end?

264
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,782
Hot! Hot!

265
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,574
Oh, come on!

266
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:42,312
Okay, little buddy, come on, move along.

267
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:46,050
Move it!

268
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:50,597
All right.

269
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:55,872
Hey!

270
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,891
Come on, shoo. Beat it.

271
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,935
Go on, beat it. Scat. Go.

272
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,036
I'm late for work.

273
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:07,462
Thank you.

274
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,104
Come on!

275
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,692
All right, what is your...

276
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,603
Rabies!

277
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:36,585
You wanna play games?

278
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:40,255
Let's play games.

279
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,860
All right. You asked for it.

280
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:23,456
I'll do it. Don't think I won't.

281
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:27,714
Mr. Lyman.

282
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:31,781
Dan, if this is some kind of stall tactic,
I'm not finding it very clever.

283
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,793
That's because there's a very good reason...

284
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,295
Miley Cyrus!

285
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,047
Seriously?

286
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,193
Please.

287
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:16,556
Come on, please, one. Just one bar.
Two bar, three bar. Good.

288
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:18,635
Mr. Lyman, it's Dan Sanders.

289
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,523
Sanders,
do you like working for me?

290
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:21,799
Yes, sir. I'm just...

291
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:23,139
I'll call you back!

292
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:25,701
I'm stuck on this plane,
and I'm very hungry.

293
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:30,084
I want a veggie burrito,
hold the guacamole, no cilantro.

294
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:31,618
I repeat... Are you taking this down?

295
00:23:34,157 --> 00:23:35,618
All right, well, clearly,
something went wrong,

296
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,115
because his office called
and said he never made the meeting.

297
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:42,018
Maybe he ran into an old friend
or an old flame.

298
00:23:42,702 --> 00:23:43,684
Thank you, Frank.

299
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,699
Keep your hands
away from the vehicle.

300
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:48,359
Do not freak out. Stand down.

301
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:06,761
Hi, Mrs. Sanders. My name is Wilson.

302
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,058
I run security for Lyman.
I protect his assets, if you will.

303
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:14,436
I'm here because I got a 425 call
over my walkie-talkie.

304
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,939
What's a 425?

305
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:17,128
A four...

306
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:21,059
Ow!

307
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:25,197
You know, now is not a good time
to field questions from civilians.

308
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,263
- This your husband's car?
- Yes, we both know that. Is he okay?

309
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,644
You tell me.

310
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,244
I tell you?

311
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:33,864
Yeah, we found his car and his phone

312
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:36,357
abandoned 2.7 clicks
into the Meriweather Pass.

313
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,919
Well, did you notify the police
about my husband?

314
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:41,255
I think
we both don't want to call the police.

315
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,756
You tell them and the next thing you know,

316
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:46,825
you'll have 60 Minutes up here
trying to sensationalize the murder.

317
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,094
- Murder?
- What murder?

318
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,694
- You said "murder. "
- There something you want to tell me

319
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:51,715
about the murder?

320
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,036
Dad got murdered?

321
00:24:54,352 --> 00:24:57,613
Come here, Skippy.
We're gonna find old Daddy,

322
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,910
whether he's in one piece
or lots of little tiny chopped up ones.

323
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:02,351
- What?
- In the meantime,

324
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:05,830
how would you like to be my deputy? Huh?
Look at him.

325
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:07,365
Yeah, a hat.

326
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,664
- Dan. Dan!
- Huh?

327
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:13,071
What happened?
I was so worried about you.

328
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:17,092
- What happened?
- Well, there was a ravine and a boulder,

329
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:20,681
and then this maniacal raccoon,
and then I lost my phone.

330
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:22,346
Oh.

331
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,140
I'm gonna borrow your charger.
I have to call Lyman.

332
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,899
What happened? Wait, honey, what...

333
00:25:25,968 --> 00:25:28,423
- Dan? What...
- Mr. Lyman, it's Dan Sanders. Listen...

334
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:29,806
Well, that was touching.

335
00:25:29,872 --> 00:25:33,222
Well, well, well. I guess you're off the hook.

336
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:36,300
Excuse me?

337
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:38,348
Dismissed.

338
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:43,525
Just don't leave town.

339
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:47,594
I got eagle eyes, Amazon woman.

340
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:50,253
Yeah. Don't freak out.

341
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:56,555
Come on.

342
00:25:57,618 --> 00:25:58,730
Freak.

343
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,473
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

344
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,550
Tomorrow.

345
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:08,016
Absolutely. That's right.

346
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,298
I know. Uh-huh.

347
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,796
Great.

348
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:19,368
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, we will be ready
for Mr. Gupta and the Indian investors.

349
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:21,804
I see.

350
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:25,768
Yes, sir. I know. All right.
Have a good night.

351
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,644
Was it something I said?

352
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:35,503
Tammy, can I come in?

353
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:37,648
It's your house.

354
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:44,462
I'm sorry.

355
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:49,352
I shouldn't have called Lyman first.
I don't know what I was thinking.

356
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:52,904
Do you have any idea
how worried I was about you?

357
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,693
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

358
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:58,826
It's just, I figured that
if I can keep Lyman happy,

359
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:00,809
then I can give you and Tyler the world.

360
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:03,698
Dan, we don't want the world.
We just want you.

361
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:09,554
I get it. So, if anyone needs me,
I'll be on the couch.

362
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,906
You don't have to sleep on the couch.

363
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,150
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

364
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:19,979
Wow, that's a lot of work for third graders.

365
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:23,499
I got roped into being in charge
of the local Forest Festival.

366
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:24,717
Cool.

367
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:28,432
I would tell you more, but you are
in desperate need of a shower.

368
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,470
I'm on it. Watch this.

369
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:37,648
I'm married to a lunatic.

370
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,460
Shut it.

371
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:22,995
Lady Gaga!

372
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:31,215
What the... Hey.

373
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,589
Shut up! Go be a pecker somewhere else!

374
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:41,552
Go on, get out of here.

375
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,469
Dan?

376
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,348
Good riddance.

377
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:49,967
Who are you talking to?

378
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:51,314
This crow.

379
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:52,851
What crow?

380
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,739
The one that flew away.

381
00:28:56,661 --> 00:28:59,313
Is that all my Forest Festival stuff
on the lawn?

382
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:00,876
No.

383
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:03,310
Yes.

384
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:04,789
I'll go get it.

385
00:29:05,014 --> 00:29:06,541
Ow!

386
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,654
I'm all over it. Just go back to bed.

387
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,352
Darn it!

388
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:16,948
Stupid crow.

389
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,972
I get up in eight hours.

390
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,487
Shut up!

391
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,242
Oops.

392
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:53,456
Idiot.

393
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,087
You got to be kidding me.

394
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,680
I don't care. It doesn't bother me.

395
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,456
Nope.

396
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,733
It's on!

397
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,048
Oh.

398
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,498
Hi, there, cutie pie.

399
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:47,439
Who's the pretty birdie?

400
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:51,928
Oh, you are, aren't you?
You make pretty sounds.

401
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,223
That's a nice little song you're singing.

402
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:57,111
Do you know any more?

403
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:59,317
I wonder what it would sound like

404
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:03,984
with your beak wrapped in duct tape.

405
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:37,394
Mom,

406
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:39,351
found him.

407
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:45,558
Honey, come on,
there's nothing wrong with me.

408
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:48,504
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

409
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:54,038
Dan, chasing crows onto rooftops
is not what I would consider "fine. "

410
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:56,344
What, exactly, are you talking about?

411
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:58,619
Tyler, Mommy and Daddy need to talk.

412
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,203
Right, 'cause the car
has soundproof windows.

413
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:03,093
Come here.

414
00:32:04,891 --> 00:32:07,640
All I am saying is
I think you should take a day off

415
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:11,352
and consult a professional.
You're obviously going through something.

416
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:17,528
I can't do that. I can't afford to miss
another meeting with Lyman.

417
00:32:17,596 --> 00:32:21,720
The guy's flying hundreds of miles
out of his way just to see me.

418
00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:24,178
Mr. Eco-Developer is flying
hundreds of miles out of his way

419
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:26,674
in a private jet in order to have a meeting
about eco-development?

420
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:27,731
Right.

421
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:30,039
Hey, that's funny.

422
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:33,010
Look, honey, just 'cause a crow
kept me up all night's

423
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,491
no reason to throw in the towel.

424
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,610
It's gonna take a lot more than that to keep
Dan Sanders from building his utopia.

425
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:51,291
Nature. Nature, nature, nature.

426
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,866
Okay, Private, on my count,

427
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,843
we're gonna charge up that ridge
and shoot some commies.

428
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,052
Take it up to eleven!

429
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:17,362
Three, two, one.

430
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:21,272
It's fun!

431
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:40,476
Don't bring me down

432
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:47,380
You're looking good
just like a snake in the grass

433
00:33:47,454 --> 00:33:50,269
One of these days
you're gonna break your glass

434
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,985
Don't bring me down

435
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:56,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

436
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:02,069
I'll tell you once more
before I get off the floor

437
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,085
Don't bring me down

438
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:31,419
Hello.

439
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:34,169
- Hi, Frank.
- Mr. Sanders,

440
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,436
I am happy to report that everything
will be ready for the investors.

441
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:40,057
Hey, can you have the guys go take a look
at the electrical in the basement?

442
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,672
'Cause something shorted out
and it could have killed me.

443
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:46,558
That's no good.
I will have my boys right on that, okay?

444
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:48,282
- You do that.
- Hey, hey, hey.

445
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:52,512
- What's wrong?
- Well, to tell you the truth,

446
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:56,667
ever since I took this promotion,
it's just been one long string of bad luck.

447
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,008
No, no, no.

448
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:02,237
You know the great Ralph Waldo Emerson?
You know what he said?

449
00:35:02,305 --> 00:35:04,858
He said, "Shallow men believe in luck. "
Okay?

450
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:07,743
"Brave men believe in cause and effect. "

451
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:08,791
That's profound.

452
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,392
- Yes, mister. Okay.
- Okay.

453
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,830
P.U.

454
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,224
- Sanders, you okay?
- Oh, my God, he's dead!

455
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,177
- Come on. Hold on.
- Move, move, move.

456
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:43,257
It's all locked.

457
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,082
- Open the door.
- Here we go.

458
00:35:45,154 --> 00:35:46,299
You all right?

459
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:50,272
- Help me!
- Captain, you all right, buddy?

460
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:52,094
- It's Frank.
- Unlock the door.

461
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:53,307
Captain.

462
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:55,965
Easy.

463
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,336
Mr. Sanders,
what did you have for breakfast?

464
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:03,164
Get the hose. Get the hose, please.

465
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,999
Gross.

466
00:36:37,443 --> 00:36:38,872
Towel. Towel.

467
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:43,388
Towel.

468
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,249
Holy smoke.

469
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:11,930
Oh, no. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm gonna...

470
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,620
This isn't what you think. You got to...

471
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:24,863
Where the heck are my clothes?

472
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:48,031
No one will see me, get in the car,
get some clothes, everything will be fine.

473
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:51,614
Get in the car, clothes, fine.
Car, clothes, fine.

474
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:58,499
Hello! Right behind you.

475
00:38:03,558 --> 00:38:05,565
Oh, jeez, he's at it again.

476
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:11,073
I had it detailed and it's very, very clean.

477
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:15,493
Hey, guys. Good work on number three.
Anybody see the game?

478
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:17,249
Nice fit, pound cake.

479
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:28,897
Get to the store, get a new suit,
get to Lyman.

480
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,921
Frank, he did it again.

481
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:42,052
Not again. Mr. Sanders, why? Why?

482
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:50,081
Then we take the pinecone and...

483
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:55,107
We take the pinecone and...

484
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,929
Oh! No, I remember. I remember now.

485
00:39:05,768 --> 00:39:09,543
We take the pinecones and...

486
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:12,898
And we...

487
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:20,198
Oh! Now I have it.

488
00:39:21,832 --> 00:39:24,101
We take the pinecones...

489
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:33,829
I'm sorry if this seems impersonal, sir,
but I'd better stay outside the aircraft,

490
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:36,515
because the German measles
are going around my kid's school.

491
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,243
We can't get a shot anywhere.

492
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:50,853
Yo, Petey. What up, brother?

493
00:39:52,104 --> 00:39:55,006
No, no, no, dude. I am in hell here, bro.

494
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:58,565
No, seriously, I feel like I'm stuck
in the Discovery Channel.

495
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,487
- Excuse me.
- No, I don't get how people with half a brain

496
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:01,927
- could live in this town.
- Excuse me.

497
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:03,487
I don't even think
they've heard of Starbucks, man.

498
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:04,543
Excuse me.

499
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:06,308
Like, come on, where can a brother
get some coffee?

500
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:07,424
Excuse me.

501
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:09,472
- Seriously, it's ridiculous.
- Hey!

502
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:11,462
Hello.

503
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:14,019
Can I help you find something?

504
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:15,550
Find something?

505
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:17,825
I am the student librarian.

506
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,800
I help people find books.

507
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:24,009
I love books. Stupid.

508
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:27,368
Okay, you wanna narrow that down
for me, Sanders?

509
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,570
Wait, how do you know my name?

510
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:33,320
Oh. I know all about you and your dad.
He's the developer, right?

511
00:40:33,546 --> 00:40:34,920
Yeah, that's us.

512
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:36,295
The tree killer.

513
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:37,671
That's us.

514
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:39,112
Mmm-hmm.

515
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:41,379
I'm Tyler.

516
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,977
Total cheeseball.

517
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:45,346
Amber. You're funny.

518
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:47,943
Not to mention extremely sophisticated.

519
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,903
Got any plans for dinner?

520
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:56,361
Okay.

521
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:01,154
Dan,
the Indians will be here in 10 days.

522
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,641
We need to show what a truly special place
Rocky Springs is.

523
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,806
Thinking caps, thinking caps

524
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:13,284
I got it. We could have

525
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:16,071
an Indian-themed barbecue.

526
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,666
What does that even mean?

527
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:20,325
Lots of things. It could mean...
Oh! Instead of burgers,

528
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,184
we have buffalo burger!

529
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,600
And we have wigwam, and teepee
and squaw.

530
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,428
Squaw.

531
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,040
You were talking about
the Gandhi type of Indians.

532
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:33,575
Uh-huh.

533
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:38,310
Wait, wait, we could sponsor
the local Forest Festival.

534
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,017
Forest Festival? That's a great idea!

535
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:45,857
Well, you see, my wife is running it.

536
00:41:45,932 --> 00:41:48,037
- And they're strapped for cash.
- You're dead to me.

537
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:50,923
It's a great way to show the community
how much we care.

538
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:55,211
Gold star, Dan.
I'll call the publicist and the media.

539
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:56,683
Yes! Excellent, sir.

540
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:02,721
Why are you shouting at me?

541
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:05,131
No, sir, I'm not shouting at you.

542
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:07,563
Okay, fine, but use your inside voice.

543
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,772
Leave me alone!

544
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,330
What is his problem?

545
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,301
Hey! Polly want a cracker?
Polly want a cracker?

546
00:42:16,524 --> 00:42:19,426
Did we not vet him?
Did we do a mental status exam on him?

547
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:21,700
Mr. Lyman?

548
00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:26,664
Are you still there, sir?

549
00:42:26,732 --> 00:42:30,049
Yes, I'm still here! All right?
Where's your brain?

550
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:33,098
Sir, it's just... I'm very sorry...

551
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:36,646
Oh, dear.

552
00:42:39,437 --> 00:42:42,601
I won't take up any more of your time,
so I'll tell you what,

553
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,229
I'll pick up a budget and a proposal

554
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,722
and then I'll give it to you tomorrow
after I huddle up with her on it.

555
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,251
Great! Bye!

556
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:54,628
Bees!

557
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,907
Honey, I'm home,
and I am the bearer of some good news.

558
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:11,974
Guess who met a friend today,
and guess who's having dinner at...

559
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:17,004
Oh, honey, what happened to your face, Dan?

560
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:19,756
And why are you wearing
my Yum Yum sweats?

561
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:22,211
I had a really long day.

562
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:27,979
Gonna find you anyway...
You shoddy little...

563
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,901
You're not fooling anyone.

564
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:39,559
Let me guess. The crow?

565
00:43:41,231 --> 00:43:43,173
I found your clothes in the garbage,

566
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:45,708
- so I put them in the wash.
- Thank you.

567
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:46,789
You're welcome.

568
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:50,278
I also made an appointment for you
with a Dr. Burr. He's a local therapist.

569
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:53,100
Tammy, I'm fine.
All I need is a good night's sleep.

570
00:43:53,168 --> 00:43:56,812
All right, fine, I'll cancel,
but one more episode and you're going.

571
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:58,823
This should help you sleep,
however. Okay?

572
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:02,092
- What is it?
- I got it from a fellow teacher at work.

573
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:08,876
"Mrs. Martin's
Mushroom herbal sleepy-bye tea. "

574
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:11,431
Mmm-hmm. Give it a try.

575
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:18,955
Mmm.

576
00:44:19,376 --> 00:44:20,423
Okay.

577
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:35,561
Tammy.

578
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:37,961
Tammy. Tammy.

579
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:41,101
I think there's somebody downstairs.

580
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:51,439
Find a spot out on the floor

581
00:44:52,145 --> 00:44:53,803
Ah, freak out!

582
00:44:53,873 --> 00:44:55,728
Le freak, c'est chic

583
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,254
Freak out!

584
00:44:57,457 --> 00:44:59,791
Le freak, c'est chic

585
00:44:59,857 --> 00:45:00,839
Freak out!

586
00:45:00,913 --> 00:45:02,637
How did you get in here?

587
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:05,582
Freak out!

588
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:07,307
Get out of my house!

589
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:23,600
Tammy, wake up.
I just had the worst nightmare.

590
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,668
No banging until 7:00.

591
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:49,609
Oh, no.

592
00:45:53,171 --> 00:45:56,880
Okay, if you don't wanna go in there,
go over there.

593
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:15,498
Dan,

594
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:18,151
what are you doing?

595
00:46:18,803 --> 00:46:19,818
Oh. Defending my home.

596
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:22,958
Okay, you need to try to explain to me
what you're talking about.

597
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:24,778
Okay.

598
00:46:25,747 --> 00:46:28,945
But you got to promise me,
no matter how crazy this sounds,

599
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:30,668
that you'll believe me.

600
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:32,013
I promise.

601
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,676
Okay, here goes.

602
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:38,732
The animals are out to get me.

603
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:41,195
And what animal
are we talking about, Dan?

604
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:43,210
That's the thing.
There's more than one of them.

605
00:46:43,284 --> 00:46:45,291
There's like this whole posse of them.

606
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:47,626
I think they're in cahoots.

607
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,944
Cahoots?

608
00:46:49,011 --> 00:46:52,907
See, you got the skunk.
He's silent but deadly.

609
00:46:54,324 --> 00:46:56,594
Then you got a crow.

610
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,013
Master of psychological warfare.

611
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:03,732
Then there's the brains of the operation,
the raccoon.

612
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:07,825
Now if I take him out,
the whole thing falls apart. Game over.

613
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,863
Well, you've done
your homework, certainly.

614
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,429
- I just have one question.
- What?

615
00:47:13,492 --> 00:47:15,381
Are you taking crazy pills?

616
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:17,584
- You promised.
- I take it back.

617
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:21,746
- Tyler, man the switch.
- No, thanks.

618
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:25,009
Operation Rodent Retreat
in five, four, three, two, one!

619
00:47:30,134 --> 00:47:31,508
Oh.

620
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:33,391
Tammy?

621
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:37,168
New Day Medical.
I'm sorry, he's in a session right now.

622
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:40,020
Now, I'd like to begin with some ink blots.

623
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,152
Tell me what you see here.

624
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:45,837
First thing that comes to mind.

625
00:47:46,357 --> 00:47:48,813
Look, I know I'm not supposed to say
it looks like an angry squirrel,

626
00:47:48,886 --> 00:47:50,773
but that looks like an angry squirrel.

627
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:52,496
Oh, boy.

628
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:55,406
What about this?

629
00:47:55,478 --> 00:47:58,740
An owl. An angry owl.
Is this supposed to be helping?

630
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,523
All right, Dan,

631
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:07,088
how long have you been afraid of animals?

632
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,817
I'm not afraid of animals.

633
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:13,454
Dan, Dan, Dan,

634
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:18,676
denial is not just a river in Egypt.

635
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:34,738
Now, I want you to listen very carefully
to what I'm gonna say to you.

636
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:37,517
The animals are not out to get you.

637
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:41,300
I know the animals are not out to get me.

638
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:45,359
- You do?
- Yes, except for these three.

639
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:48,758
This one does all the talking.
These ones follow his orders.

640
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,126
Jesus.

641
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:55,378
Dan, you're suffering
from work-related stress

642
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:57,935
and we need to find your happy place.

643
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:03,053
Now, we'll start by closing your eyes
and taking a deep breath.

644
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:06,039
And now another deep breath.

645
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:09,166
In and out.

646
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:14,103
In and out.

647
00:49:22,616 --> 00:49:23,663
In

648
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:25,586
and out.

649
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:27,503
In

650
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:29,234
and out.

651
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:37,616
How do you feel?

652
00:49:44,217 --> 00:49:45,264
I feel great.

653
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:48,207
And you're not seeing things anymore,
are you?

654
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:49,941
No, and...

655
00:49:55,385 --> 00:49:56,368
Dan?

656
00:50:05,146 --> 00:50:06,553
Are you okay?

657
00:50:15,642 --> 00:50:17,878
Is something out there bothering you?

658
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:20,339
Is it the animals?

659
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:26,480
Because you and I both know that
there's nothing outside that window, right?

660
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,464
Dan?

661
00:50:30,522 --> 00:50:33,108
Hey, stop! That's my hybrid! Hey!

662
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:36,794
Stop, stop, stop! Come here, you!

663
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:40,756
I knew it. This is my car.

664
00:50:40,827 --> 00:50:42,518
Get out of my car.

665
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:45,455
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
No, don't touch that... Don't...

666
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:53,297
I'm going to crush you!

667
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,936
Thank you, sir, may I have another?
I love it.

668
00:51:00,507 --> 00:51:01,652
Get off.

669
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:06,583
Uh-oh.

670
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:09,815
Why are you doing this to me?
What did I ever do to you?

671
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:12,468
I don't have a problem with animals,
even when they bite.

672
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,322
I like animals. Where are we going? Wait!

673
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:25,041
Ooh. That just hit the ball boy.

674
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:28,083
- Okay, what do I do?
- Okay. So, angle it up. There you go.

675
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:30,010
- Okay.
- There we go.

676
00:51:30,076 --> 00:51:32,019
- Okay.
- And spike it! Nice.

677
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:34,006
- Yeah.
- You know, we could always play

678
00:51:34,076 --> 00:51:37,142
- on an actual tennis court.
- Yeah, but where's the fun in that?

679
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:40,856
Amber, how long have you lived up here?

680
00:51:40,924 --> 00:51:43,641
I was born here, Mrs. Sanders.

681
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:45,177
Oh, really?

682
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:46,739
I love it here.

683
00:51:47,517 --> 00:51:49,372
- Yeah, right.
- Mrs. Sanders.

684
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,734
Now what?

685
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:05,108
Dan?

686
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:08,470
Therapy went well.

687
00:52:15,229 --> 00:52:16,658
What happened?

688
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:21,241
If you really need to know,
I got carjacked by a raccoon and a skunk.

689
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:22,681
You must be Amber.

690
00:52:22,749 --> 00:52:24,156
Yeah.

691
00:52:24,222 --> 00:52:25,748
It's nice to meet you. If you'll excuse me,

692
00:52:25,822 --> 00:52:28,604
I need to remove a leech
from my no-no zone.

693
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:30,523
Oh, my God.

694
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,767
Bye-bye.

695
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,132
Dan.

696
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,357
I'm telling you,
these animals are out to get me.

697
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:40,502
I don't know why you won't believe me.

698
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,160
Because it's not possible.
Raccoons do not carjack SUVs.

699
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,750
Well, this one did, and I will prove it to you.

700
00:53:00,574 --> 00:53:02,680
- Hey, Tyler.
- Hey, Dad.

701
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,054
Are you okay?

702
00:53:05,854 --> 00:53:07,894
I think we both know
that I'm way beyond okay.

703
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:10,869
See, I got these Indian investors
coming to town,

704
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:14,653
and there's a maniacal sociopathic raccoon
that's been ruining my life,

705
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,338
but no one seems to believe that it exists.

706
00:53:18,751 --> 00:53:21,914
For whatever it's worth,
I don't think you're crazy.

707
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,618
Amber gave me this book on local folklore.

708
00:53:26,687 --> 00:53:27,669
Mmm-hmm.

709
00:53:27,743 --> 00:53:30,394
I think there's something you should see.

710
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,680
Look, you're not the first person
to ever try and settle Rocky Springs.

711
00:53:34,751 --> 00:53:38,613
This area was first settled
by Tookoo the Caveman in 9,000 BC.

712
00:53:42,592 --> 00:53:44,730
Tookoo disappeared without a trace,

713
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:47,646
and many others in history
have tried and failed.

714
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:49,654
There was Sigurd the Viking.

715
00:53:53,152 --> 00:53:54,908
Jedediah the Puritan.

716
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:57,658
We are all God's children

717
00:53:58,656 --> 00:54:00,990
And there was Terrance the Hippie.

718
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:02,617
Hey, little fella.

719
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,607
Where are you going with this?

720
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:11,226
Look, I did a bunch of research, okay?

721
00:54:11,296 --> 00:54:14,646
It seems like your buddy, Lyman,
has pretty deep pockets in Washington.

722
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,069
He got them to rezone what was supposed
to be a preserved forest.

723
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:26,939
No, I don't know.
I'm sure that's not the case.

724
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:28,765
It is, okay?

725
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:32,411
You're building on a nature preserve
and frankly, it's ticking nature off.

726
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:34,270
Are you telling me that
the animals are trying to get me

727
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,995
to stop developing Rocky Springs?

728
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,171
No, I think they're past that.

729
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:41,530
I think the animals are out for revenge.

730
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,037
Beasty biting thing!

731
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,474
Got you.

732
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:16,670
I knew your luck would run out.

733
00:55:20,002 --> 00:55:21,431
It's a setup.

734
00:55:25,123 --> 00:55:26,911
Oh, there you are.

735
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:31,129
Hi, little fella. This is a cute trick. Yeah.

736
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,146
It's supposed to be you?

737
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,738
My turn now.

738
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,857
You're his friend.

739
00:56:23,524 --> 00:56:25,412
No, no, no.

740
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:29,146
No, no, no! No!

741
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,325
Go steal a picnic basket!

742
00:56:33,445 --> 00:56:35,354
No!

743
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:55,524
Frank, have you seen my husband
this morning?

744
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:58,109
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sanders,
I have not seen him.

745
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,156
Have you seen my toilet?

746
00:57:00,229 --> 00:57:02,717
I just don't think this can get any worse.

747
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,577
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

748
00:57:04,645 --> 00:57:06,750
- I stand corrected.
- Nobody move.

749
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,035
Well...

750
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,724
Well, well, well, well.

751
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:19,940
Mrs. Sanders.

752
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:23,650
You have no idea
where your husband is, do you?

753
00:57:23,718 --> 00:57:25,344
Guilty as charged.

754
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:30,365
You know, I'm getting a little tired
of your dumb-dumb show

755
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:32,828
and your poppycocks and your jiggery...

756
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:36,607
- I don't want you to speak anymore.
- Don't do that.

757
00:57:36,678 --> 00:57:38,565
- I found him.
- Dan.

758
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,669
Oh.

759
00:57:45,638 --> 00:57:46,719
Where?

760
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:50,497
- You have got to be kidding me.
- Hello?

761
00:57:51,494 --> 00:57:54,396
Dan? Dan, honey, are you in there?

762
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,609
Does anyone have some Purell?

763
00:57:57,254 --> 00:58:00,189
Don't worry, Mr. Sanders,
we'll have you down in no time.

764
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:04,930
Sooner than you think.

765
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:06,399
Come on.

766
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,416
You might wanna cover your eyes.

767
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,606
Get the hose.

768
00:58:17,192 --> 00:58:18,686
- Tammy?
- Fire!

769
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:34,366
- Are you okay, boss?
- Yeah, yeah, real good.

770
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:36,349
Nothing like a cold shower
to wake you up in the morning.

771
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:40,294
So you guys are making
really good progress on unit three,

772
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,302
and I was thinking about laying
some pipe right about...

773
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,339
You are mine.

774
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:50,398
Dan.

775
00:58:53,928 --> 00:58:56,100
This ends now.

776
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,430
I don't know where he thinks he's going
without my keys,

777
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:11,075
Unless I left them in the car.

778
00:59:25,802 --> 00:59:27,492
Let's end this now.

779
00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:31,426
Ready,

780
00:59:34,346 --> 00:59:35,393
aim,

781
00:59:38,122 --> 00:59:39,366
aim again.

782
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:49,475
I can't do it. I'm not a killer.

783
00:59:50,377 --> 00:59:52,931
Come on, can't we just figure this out?

784
01:00:04,555 --> 01:00:06,889
I was trying to make this work, and you...

785
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:18,305
Now, you look here! I've got...

786
01:00:40,651 --> 01:00:42,058
Bull's eye.

787
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,264
Lucky for you, I got LoJack.

788
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:51,906
Is it dead?

789
01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:54,282
No, just shot him with my tankalizer gun.

790
01:00:54,347 --> 01:00:56,420
He's just taking a tankalizer-gun nap.

791
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:58,728
How many more of these things
have you got?

792
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:01,731
I got a whole warehouse
stocked down in Harrison. Why?

793
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:03,782
What are you thinking?

794
01:01:03,852 --> 01:01:05,379
I'm thinking about

795
01:01:06,732 --> 01:01:07,976
cleaning house.

796
01:01:11,052 --> 01:01:12,329
Tree skunk.

797
01:01:15,788 --> 01:01:17,446
They live in the hollers.

798
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:21,897
It's a beautiful morning

799
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,147
Bring them in, boys!

800
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:28,908
Put those possums on the top.

801
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:30,347
- All right.
- Yeah.

802
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:33,256
And watch out for them ferrets.

803
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,575
No sense in staying inside

804
01:01:37,644 --> 01:01:42,500
If the weather's fine
and you got the time

805
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:47,243
It's your chance to wake up
and plan another brand new day

806
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:48,291
Either way

807
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:50,853
It's a beautiful morning

808
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:56,354
Stack them high, boys.
Stack them high. Hey!

809
01:01:56,941 --> 01:01:59,941
Not so tough, are we now, Mr. Tom Turkey?

810
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:07,812
- Morning, Mr. Sanders.
- Morning, guys.

811
01:02:07,886 --> 01:02:09,576
Not a raccoon in sight.

812
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:15,756
It just ain't no good if the sun shines

813
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:17,099
When you're still inside

814
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,291
- Shouldn't hide
- Still inside

815
01:02:29,102 --> 01:02:32,364
You know, with our animals locked up
and under control,

816
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,601
I think we could speed up phase two
by several months.

817
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:35,653
That would be correct.

818
01:02:35,727 --> 01:02:38,509
- Mind if I join you?
- Please. Do sit down.

819
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:42,472
Thank you. So, Dan said you wanted
to go over a few of the festival details.

820
01:02:42,543 --> 01:02:45,542
Well, first of all, Tammy,
I mean, you've done a fantastic job.

821
01:02:45,614 --> 01:02:46,597
Thank you.

822
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,231
I just have a few tweaks.

823
01:02:48,303 --> 01:02:49,765
Tweaks, tweaks.

824
01:02:50,287 --> 01:02:54,346
Our current plans for the festival,
well, they're depressing.

825
01:02:54,414 --> 01:02:55,398
Huh?

826
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:58,024
And this whole thing about pollution
and the trees.

827
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:04,710
Please. If my Indian investors
wanna be reminded about pollution,

828
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:06,278
they'll stay home in Calcutta.

829
01:03:06,352 --> 01:03:07,562
Stink-o.

830
01:03:08,144 --> 01:03:10,990
Well, what do you want me to do?
Get eco-go-go dancers?

831
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:12,845
Great idea. Jot that down.

832
01:03:12,911 --> 01:03:14,156
Write this down.

833
01:03:15,408 --> 01:03:16,717
Hey, Mom, you owe me 25 bucks.

834
01:03:16,784 --> 01:03:19,653
Yeah, ma, 25 bucks. Stupid!

835
01:03:28,655 --> 01:03:32,234
Wait up. Wait. Stop. Stop.

836
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:36,521
You holding up?

837
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:39,145
You kidding? I love cross-country running.

838
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:41,994
Well, come on, we only got 10 more miles.

839
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:43,627
Awesome.

840
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:50,410
Hey, so, how's your dad? He feeling better?

841
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:53,929
Much. Yeah, I really think
he's turned a corner.

842
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,491
Look, I know you see him as

843
01:03:56,561 --> 01:04:00,173
Mr. Evil-Let's-Develop-The-Ozone
And-Destroy-The-Rain-Forest guy,

844
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:02,150
but he really means well.

845
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:06,796
Look, I don't think your dad's a bad guy.
I just don't like what they're doing.

846
01:04:07,185 --> 01:04:11,440
Well, they are sponsoring the festival.
That has to count for something.

847
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:13,286
Well, yeah.

848
01:04:16,946 --> 01:04:18,701
Amber, is everything okay?

849
01:04:19,153 --> 01:04:20,680
Yeah, you know,

850
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:25,066
I was just thinking about midterms,

851
01:04:25,713 --> 01:04:29,837
my allowance, when you were gonna
get up the guts to kiss me.

852
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,548
Is everything okay?

853
01:05:00,883 --> 01:05:01,995
Hello?

854
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:11,314
- I knew it.
- No, no, This has to be a mistake.

855
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:13,484
Really? 'Cause it makes
perfect sense to me.

856
01:05:14,259 --> 01:05:16,462
God, the things people do for a dollar.

857
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:19,116
- Amber, wait up.
- Just leave me alone.

858
01:05:19,188 --> 01:05:20,529
Don't lump me in with my dad.

859
01:05:20,595 --> 01:05:22,155
Kind of hard not to.

860
01:05:25,043 --> 01:05:26,352
Thanks, Dad.

861
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:28,977
- Keep it straight. Easy.
- Okay, I am.

862
01:05:29,044 --> 01:05:32,841
Good job with the Moon Bounce,
guys. Put the Ferris wheel over here.

863
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:35,304
Yeah, I got it. I got it.
Just give me a minute, okay?

864
01:05:35,379 --> 01:05:39,209
Dan, we've got to do something.
Your boss is ruining the whole festival.

865
01:05:39,284 --> 01:05:40,266
Tammy, it's not that bad.

866
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,729
Yeah, it is. It's going against everything
it's meant to be.

867
01:05:42,804 --> 01:05:44,210
It's a disaster. It's embarrassing.

868
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:47,276
Calm down, will you? What do you
want me to do, Tammy? He's my boss.

869
01:05:50,004 --> 01:05:52,240
- So, were you ever gonna tell me?
- Tell you what?

870
01:05:52,308 --> 01:05:54,097
About your four-legged prison.

871
01:05:54,323 --> 01:05:56,179
Oh.

872
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,099
It's not what you think it is, all right?

873
01:05:58,164 --> 01:06:01,229
It's just for a couple of days
until the investors leave and then...

874
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,347
Then what?

875
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:05,387
Well, we let the animals free
and everything's fine,

876
01:06:05,492 --> 01:06:06,769
and you know what?

877
01:06:06,836 --> 01:06:09,619
They're probably a little bit better off
right now because they're safe.

878
01:06:09,684 --> 01:06:10,763
Wow!

879
01:06:11,893 --> 01:06:13,965
You are so blind to the facts.

880
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,563
You work for a green company

881
01:06:15,637 --> 01:06:18,058
and you're signing orders
to cage little animals.

882
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:20,042
You're such a hypocrite.

883
01:06:23,797 --> 01:06:24,844
- Hey, Tyler.
- No, Mom.

884
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,356
Wait a minute.

885
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:30,098
What, I'm the bad guy?

886
01:06:30,517 --> 01:06:33,005
Oh, come on. No.

887
01:06:58,902 --> 01:07:00,724
Well, I hope it was worth it.

888
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:04,464
You know, my family
has completely turned against me.

889
01:07:06,198 --> 01:07:08,653
Why me? What did I ever do to you?

890
01:07:10,518 --> 01:07:14,576
Great, I'm trying to get sympathy
from a raccoon. Like you'd understand.

891
01:07:17,238 --> 01:07:18,765
Found your kids.

892
01:07:27,607 --> 01:07:29,232
You have a family.

893
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:37,133
All this time,
you were protecting them from me.

894
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,116
Hold still, Beatrice.

895
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,544
There!

896
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,327
Way to go, Cooper!

897
01:08:14,072 --> 01:08:15,020
Pickle hit!

898
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:16,660
Come on, come on.

899
01:08:16,728 --> 01:08:20,143
Stinky loves pickles!
Stinky loves pickles!

900
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:22,803
Once we break ground on phase two,

901
01:08:22,872 --> 01:08:25,589
Dan here will be able to build
a dozen residential areas,

902
01:08:25,656 --> 01:08:27,631
which will all be gated communities.

903
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:33,043
All right, be strong.

904
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:35,407
Stop developments in Rocky Springs!

905
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,618
Keep our forest green!

906
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:39,373
Sign the petition.

907
01:08:40,152 --> 01:08:42,062
Stop development in Rocky Springs.

908
01:08:42,137 --> 01:08:43,445
Hi, Mr. Houston.

909
01:08:43,513 --> 01:08:45,717
You, take one. It's really important.

910
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:47,640
Amber! Amber!

911
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:48,720
What?

912
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,036
What are you doing?

913
01:08:50,105 --> 01:08:52,920
Gandhi said to be the change
that you want to see in the world.

914
01:08:52,984 --> 01:08:55,919
Well, did Gandhi ever talk about
you not returning my phone calls

915
01:08:55,993 --> 01:08:57,367
or my text messages?

916
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:00,782
Well, excuse me, I've been a little busy
trying to stop your dad.

917
01:09:00,857 --> 01:09:03,378
You know what? If you're gonna
do something, then do it right.

918
01:09:04,602 --> 01:09:06,031
Tyler. Tyler.

919
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:16,718
Stop the development of Rocky Springs!
Sign our petition and keep our forest green!

920
01:09:17,305 --> 01:09:18,483
Show-off.

921
01:09:18,553 --> 01:09:19,797
Now if we use solar energy,

922
01:09:19,866 --> 01:09:22,648
we can raise rental prices
at least 10% over market value

923
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:26,194
while generating free publicity
for being economically conscious.

924
01:09:26,266 --> 01:09:27,859
Speaking of economically conscious,

925
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,745
Dan's wife, and our festival coordinator,
Tammy Sanders.

926
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,298
- Tammy.
- Thank you. I'm proud.

927
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:36,665
The first Forest Festival
that has nothing to do with the forest.

928
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:38,323
That's not true.

929
01:09:38,394 --> 01:09:39,376
Dad!

930
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,687
Oh, and this is Dan's son, Tyler.

931
01:09:41,754 --> 01:09:42,932
How's it going, kids?

932
01:09:43,003 --> 01:09:45,174
Yeah, we're trying to stop the reckless
development of the forest

933
01:09:45,243 --> 01:09:46,737
by Lyman Enterprises.

934
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:49,428
Funny. Kids these days.

935
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:51,702
Tyler, I know you must be
very angry with me right now...

936
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,087
- Look, this has nothing to do with you, Dad.
- The animals are gonna be killed.

937
01:09:55,163 --> 01:09:56,821
Killed? No.

938
01:09:57,371 --> 01:10:00,502
There must be
some sort of communication breakdown.

939
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:03,928
Lyman Industries, we don't kill animals.
We're just going to relocate them.

940
01:10:03,995 --> 01:10:05,456
Yeah, but that's just the same
as killing them.

941
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:06,676
I mean, you can't just relocate animals.

942
01:10:06,747 --> 01:10:07,892
Enough.

943
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:10,773
I've heard all I need to hear.

944
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:13,656
Lyman, you got a deal.

945
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:15,322
- What?
- What?

946
01:10:15,547 --> 01:10:16,724
What about the animals?

947
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,770
Less animals, less hassle.

948
01:10:19,163 --> 01:10:21,138
- Let's get rid of them.
- What?

949
01:10:21,211 --> 01:10:23,732
Great, I'll call business affairs.
We'll get the contracts here.

950
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,778
Do you have a fax machine, something?

951
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,645
- So now we're killing animals?
- Hey, I...

952
01:10:30,715 --> 01:10:32,952
Congratulations. Well done, Dad.

953
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,216
Wait. I thought that relocating the animals
wouldn't be a problem...

954
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:41,012
I'm gonna go take care of our son.

955
01:10:43,133 --> 01:10:45,783
- Where are you going?
- There's something I've got to do.

956
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,730
I'll do what I can to create a diversion,

957
01:10:52,284 --> 01:10:55,796
so what I want you to do
is get your families and get out of here.

958
01:10:55,868 --> 01:10:57,527
All right? Good luck.

959
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:23,220
Darling, over here! Look at the
camera. Darling. Say cheese, darling.

960
01:11:23,294 --> 01:11:26,393
Come on. Come on, honey.
Come on, look over here.

961
01:11:26,461 --> 01:11:29,495
Show me your punim, honey.
Come on, look over here.

962
01:11:31,517 --> 01:11:33,427
That's a very large owl.

963
01:11:53,566 --> 01:11:56,284
All right! All right, freeze!

964
01:11:58,174 --> 01:12:00,891
Oh. Oh, there's a lot of you.

965
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:03,995
Don't freak out.

966
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:07,059
Freaking out!

967
01:12:10,335 --> 01:12:12,921
How about a hand for the band,
ladies and...

968
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:17,046
Friends and...

969
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,130
It's broken. It's broken.

970
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:23,865
Hayseed.

971
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:28,500
Friends and neighbors,
my name is Neil Lyman,

972
01:12:28,575 --> 01:12:31,258
and on behalf of Lyman Enterprises,

973
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:34,071
it has been a privilege
to be a part of your little community.

974
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,501
Today... Thank you. Thank you.

975
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:41,561
Today marks a new beginning
for this little town of yours.

976
01:12:41,855 --> 01:12:43,895
Some have called it backwater.

977
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:46,007
- Some have called it irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?

978
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,835
Two-teeth maximum.

979
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:51,067
But I see your little corner of nature
for what it could be,

980
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,879
a center for a new suburbia.

981
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:56,346
Thank you.

982
01:12:56,896 --> 01:12:58,008
Thank you.

983
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:02,490
With me today is a great man

984
01:13:03,168 --> 01:13:05,535
who will change your little world.

985
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:09,115
So, without further ado...

986
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:11,804
Stop the development of Rocky Springs.

987
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:15,133
Stop the development of Rocky Springs.

988
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:19,516
My son, Tyler, here,

989
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:22,015
he was right.

990
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:23,701
You were right.

991
01:13:25,121 --> 01:13:26,779
This man's a fraud.

992
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:29,179
He's not eco-friendly.

993
01:13:30,017 --> 01:13:31,424
He's not even friendly.

994
01:13:31,489 --> 01:13:34,489
All right.
That's a little below the belt, okay?

995
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:38,104
I forced my family to move here.

996
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:43,222
I said it was for the fresh air,
for them to have a better life.

997
01:13:48,033 --> 01:13:50,586
I was just trying to further my career.

998
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:57,082
I came here because I thought
that I was building a community,

999
01:13:57,154 --> 01:13:58,648
but the truth is

1000
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:01,367
I was just stealing one.

1001
01:14:02,497 --> 01:14:04,505
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1002
01:14:04,801 --> 01:14:06,111
I'm sorry.

1003
01:14:08,641 --> 01:14:11,511
Sorry about this. Security. Security, please.

1004
01:14:13,122 --> 01:14:15,675
Okay, what if I told you people
I was about to pour in

1005
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:19,008
$100 million into the local economy?

1006
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:20,798
Who's friendly now, huh?

1007
01:14:20,866 --> 01:14:22,808
Who's friendly now?

1008
01:14:22,946 --> 01:14:25,729
- Don't listen to him.
- Mr. Sanders.

1009
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:31,962
Okay, folks. All right, nothing to see here.

1010
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:35,613
Let's not let a few rotten apples
spoil a great time, all right?

1011
01:14:35,683 --> 01:14:39,479
So, Mr. Gupta,
if you will kindly take my pen.

1012
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:41,693
Drum roll, please.

1013
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:51,807
Is that all you got?

1014
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:03,612
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

1015
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:08,483
- Okay. Sign, sir.
- I'm not signing this.

1016
01:15:12,227 --> 01:15:13,405
Do it.

1017
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:14,457
- No.
- Do it.

1018
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:16,255
- I don't want to do it.
- I don't care!

1019
01:15:16,324 --> 01:15:17,666
- Fine.
- Good.

1020
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:20,379
Okay.

1021
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:22,814
Drum roll, please.

1022
01:15:30,756 --> 01:15:31,966
Now what?

1023
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:42,655
Purkles.

1024
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,155
Look!

1025
01:15:49,636 --> 01:15:51,840
It is raccoon.

1026
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,714
- Sweet pea.
- You complete me!

1027
01:16:38,405 --> 01:16:40,958
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1028
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,306
My contract!

1029
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:46,500
- Now do you believe me?
- I will never doubt you again!

1030
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:54,911
I remember our first Forest Festival.

1031
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:56,389
Amber! Amber!

1032
01:17:09,382 --> 01:17:11,455
Get off. Move. Get off!

1033
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:12,607
I got the key.

1034
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:14,621
- Look, Brad Pitt.
- Where?

1035
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:17,343
I got it!

1036
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:22,978
So I started this business, oh, years ago,

1037
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:25,186
way, way back when you were just an egg.

1038
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,530
Tammy!

1039
01:17:52,552 --> 01:17:54,625
Goodbye, raccoon.

1040
01:18:03,017 --> 01:18:04,423
It was an accident. Oh, my God!

1041
01:18:06,793 --> 01:18:08,167
The deal is...

1042
01:18:09,193 --> 01:18:11,779
No, it's not off! No!

1043
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:26,175
We're good.

1044
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,225
It's right here, right here.

1045
01:18:29,225 --> 01:18:32,574
"Mr. Gupta. " Good, good, good, good.
Good enough.

1046
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:34,242
Deal! Sweet dreams.

1047
01:18:39,177 --> 01:18:40,933
This is not what you think.

1048
01:18:42,569 --> 01:18:43,878
Hey!

1049
01:18:44,682 --> 01:18:47,267
Dan, I'll be right back.

1050
01:18:52,778 --> 01:18:54,687
Bruce Lee from the grave.

1051
01:18:55,754 --> 01:18:57,281
So long, suckers.

1052
01:18:58,538 --> 01:19:00,229
So long, suckers.

1053
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:20,903
You ain't so bad. You ain't so tough.

1054
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:23,626
There's a bear driving a golf cart.

1055
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:24,934
Doing a good job, too.

1056
01:19:25,003 --> 01:19:26,377
Put that tail down.

1057
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:28,969
That's gross.

1058
01:19:33,867 --> 01:19:36,234
Can I just say that I'm really sorry?

1059
01:19:36,299 --> 01:19:39,845
I got my priorities completely out of order,

1060
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:44,452
and I love you, Tyler.

1061
01:19:44,524 --> 01:19:46,792
Dad. Dad, not cool, okay?

1062
01:19:47,212 --> 01:19:49,033
Tyler, tell your father that you love him.

1063
01:19:49,099 --> 01:19:50,244
- What?
- Do it.

1064
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:52,170
- Do it. Do it. Do it now.
- Tyler.

1065
01:19:52,235 --> 01:19:53,577
Tell him.

1066
01:19:53,643 --> 01:19:54,723
Tyler.

1067
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:57,025
- I love you, Dad.
- Come on, say it.

1068
01:19:57,099 --> 01:19:58,048
Hmm?

1069
01:19:58,155 --> 01:20:00,359
- I love you, too, Dad.
- Oh, you do.

1070
01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:04,196
- I love you, too.
- I love you.

1071
01:20:07,339 --> 01:20:09,346
Hey, your parents are right there.

1072
01:20:10,444 --> 01:20:12,516
Are we gonna be all right?

1073
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:16,801
We're gonna be just fine.

1074
01:20:53,901 --> 01:20:56,389
Now, this is a pinecone,

1075
01:20:56,461 --> 01:20:59,178
and I'm painting it for Christmas.

1076
01:20:59,246 --> 01:21:01,514
So you can hang it on your door,

1077
01:21:01,965 --> 01:21:04,748
in case you ever have a door.

1078
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:09,450
Who you trying to get crazy with, ese?
Don't you know I'm loco?

1079
01:21:25,454 --> 01:21:27,658
To the one on the flamboyant tip

1080
01:21:27,726 --> 01:21:30,573
I'll just toss that ham in the fryin' pan
like spam

1081
01:21:30,638 --> 01:21:32,362
It's done when I come and slam

1082
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,634
Yeah, let me tell you who I am

1083
01:21:34,702 --> 01:21:36,939
Don't make me spell it
Watch me get reckless

1084
01:21:37,006 --> 01:21:39,210
Burning up the track like I was electric

1085
01:21:39,278 --> 01:21:41,700
Damn, the lights are blinkin', I'm thinkin'

1086
01:21:41,774 --> 01:21:43,684
It's all over when
your brain starts shrinkin'

1087
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:45,930
Oh, makin' my mind slow

1088
01:21:45,999 --> 01:21:48,203
But I can't stop when my body says go

1089
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,180
Bro, I gotta maintain

1090
01:21:50,254 --> 01:21:53,069
'Cause a freak like me is goin' insane

1091
01:21:53,134 --> 01:21:55,403
Insane in da membrane

1092
01:21:55,471 --> 01:21:57,576
Insane in da brain

1093
01:21:57,647 --> 01:21:59,884
Insane in da membrane

1094
01:21:59,951 --> 01:22:01,958
Insane in da brain

1095
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:04,332
Insane in da membrane

1096
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,571
Going insane
Got no brain!

1097
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,973
Insane in da membrane

1098
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:10,501
Insane in da brain

1099
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:12,997
You know I rhyme like no other
Now it's time for the blubber

1100
01:22:13,072 --> 01:22:15,243
Blabber, watch that belly get fatter

1101
01:22:15,312 --> 01:22:17,516
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it

1102
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,788
Steppin' to me is like steppin' to a giant

1103
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:21,765
Much too fast like a sumo

1104
01:22:21,839 --> 01:22:24,228
Hitting that mat
Leaving your face in the grass

1105
01:22:24,304 --> 01:22:26,573
You know, I don't take this thing lightly

1106
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,811
Punks just jealous
'cause they can't outwrite me

1107
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,051
So kick that style, wicked, wild

1108
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,357
Happy face clown never seen me smile

1109
01:22:33,424 --> 01:22:35,595
Rip dat mainframe, I'll explain

1110
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:38,152
A freak like me is goin' insane

1111
01:22:38,224 --> 01:22:40,395
Insane in da membrane

1112
01:22:40,464 --> 01:22:42,668
Insane in da brain

1113
01:22:42,736 --> 01:22:44,940
Insane in da membrane

1114
01:22:45,008 --> 01:22:47,179
Insane in da brain

1115
01:22:47,248 --> 01:22:49,550
Insane in da membrane

1116
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:51,439
Going insane, got no brain

1117
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:54,093
