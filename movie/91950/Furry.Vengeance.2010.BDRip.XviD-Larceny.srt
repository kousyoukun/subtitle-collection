1
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,025
I make it as rich.

2
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,865
Oh, hey, a guy here.

3
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:41,276
You communicate with me.
Hey Neal, I just know.

4
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:43,115
How To was?

5
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,412
It is the ordinary!

6
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,597
If once you cut the forest boy,
have time on this, I tell you.

7
00:01:52,474 --> 00:01:57,007
¿Sanders?, Oh, no.
I can say that it will do
well, but play tomorrow

8
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,483
let him know that I will be
overseeing the operation.

9
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:03,324
Alo Mr. Lyman. Alo.

10
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,642
Take that, do not
lose, whatever.

11
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,641
Oh, ¿Qué is this?
Stripping out of my way.

12
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:31,146
You have to calm small. Run.

13
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:39,867
That was amazing.

14
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,969
Do not put that ...

15
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:05,353
Very funny, poor raccoon.
Evil, evil raccoon.

16
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,278
Mr. Lyman, quit!

17
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,403
Nature.

18
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,630
Look people, my captain
has awakened.

19
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:08,862
Good morning Greg.

20
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:13,335
- Let's see if they made the reprogramming.
- There's nothing like having
the chief legal officer.

21
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:18,350
I have a question, you have the answer.
It's like I get the idea.

22
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,920
This in months have
been a disaster.

23
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,302
You see that gate is not good.

24
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,483
I do not know if I can say
the same for that tree.

25
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:34,559
It's what people do, is good,
helps with things.

26
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:35,952
I do not like.

27
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:39,000
Good for you to stay with
this view and say it.

28
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:42,700
If not we just be done
and then home.

29
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,643
I do not know if you are worried
or agree in this regard,

30
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:55,367
Well.
I can make it look like an accident.
I expect this to happen
accidentally.

31
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:56,904
I do not know.

32
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:00,750
The rocks are hard to get
here so take your time.

33
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:08,000
I want you to work on that and come back to me.
Hey I love the guys in the # 3.

34
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,033
I guess it must be
around the park.

35
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:13,676
They heard the captain!
Build quickly.

36
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,192
zIn serious?

37
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:27,966
Those are my berries.

38
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:48,886
MODEL HOUSE

39
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:01,244
Sure.

40
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,743
- Still sleeping.
- I was awake.

41
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:27,832
It's time. Bring your tools.

42
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,755
Tyler misses his old life.

43
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:44,569
¿Qué say? Do you want to thank?

44
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:46,907
Come and get the largest double.

45
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:51,447
And do not give up.

46
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,494
- Hello Tammy.
- Good morning sweetness.

47
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:17,344
- Not the world.
- Well I have seen something
in Chicago.

48
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,985
The fabulous time that was earlier.
We have a great time here.
Peace and tranquility.

49
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,731
And some builders.

50
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,306
Wild turkeys.

51
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:36,046
Dan, let's not fret you can eat
it in them, because that's bad.

52
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,694
How To may be turkey
is cooked bacon?

53
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,808
They have a sixth
sense that low.

54
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,218
Hey baby. How To sleep?

55
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:55,762
Nothing good, I had a nasty nightmare
that my parents took me

56
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:59,170
wonderful home and put her
in the middle of nowhere.

57
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:06,050
- He just has fun.
- How To may be having fun

58
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:09,393
if you have spent all summer in her room
talking on the internet on your PC.

59
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:13,364
He knows everything, we will be here for
a year and then return to Chicago.

60
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:17,514
- You must talk to him.
- That's just irritate it more.

61
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,683
Dan, you're his dad, try.

62
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:29,570
Tyler, Do you want to join
me for a walk outside?

63
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:34,142
Tyler We want the girls to
see how strong you are.

64
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,853
They will believe you're
a city dweller.

65
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,921
- I did today, there are beautiful girls out there.
- There it is.

66
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,233
¿Sabes with which we began?

67
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,743
Poisonous Snakes.
They're all over the forest.

68
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:49,511
How To him be gone this guy?

69
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:54,754
Okay, you win, I will resign my job,
packed up and returned to Chicago.

70
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:56,833
¿Eso would make you happy?
But it's not a question.

71
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,802
- No, do not touch.
- Why?

72
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:03,310
- It's for my boss.
- ¯Todas?

73
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,943
If I will try them all, do
not know what you like.

74
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,691
zIn serious?

75
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:12,093
- ¯Hey we agree?
- Yeah, never better.

76
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:14,036
Well.

77
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,461
Get a good one.

78
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,244
- And you will.
- He.

79
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:48,105
80 000 dollars for it.
Are you sure that is?

80
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:58,624
All right, just, take care of that, you have
to look like an accident, I'll call Frank.

81
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:32,001
Mr. Lyman. Welcome
to RockySpring.

82
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:34,543
Hey Dan.

83
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:41,690
Do not keep waiting, I bought the plane yesterday
and I see the work of the factory as well.

84
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,794
And this for your child.

85
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:50,545
Oh thanks Mr.
Lyman is very kind of you.

86
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:52,049
FEZ will be 4 right?

87
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,192
No, actually turn 16 next month.

88
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:59,396
April says here you sure?

89
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:01,640
If I'm very sure.

90
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:12,461
Actually ...

91
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:17,132
The toy is great, I love it.

92
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,241
- Is not it crazy all this
- very crazy.

93
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:21,175
- I have two children.
- 3.

94
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,481
3 and can not remember their names which are y.
..

95
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,556
- John.
- If Junior.

96
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,988
They're just babies.

97
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,932
- They are rich.
- Can not be.

98
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:33,800
Well, I brought the car brought
some beer and sandwiches

99
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,069
and them as they please.

100
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,256
Now, in both how long it takes.

101
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:42,429
They arrived two hours later.

102
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:45,570
I think not.

103
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:49,544
¿Sanguches? Very bad.

104
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:05,007
Now just make sure to review
their actions carefully.

105
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,381
I'm very strict about no
children in my back.

106
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:10,182
¿Entienden? Ok.

107
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:13,521
Prmero Prmero what I would like to
warmly welcome our new teacher.

108
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,935
Tammy of Chicago.

109
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:24,076
I'm sure you all know that
one of our teachers

110
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:28,423
Mr. Valwin math is sick for
the rest of the year.

111
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,966
Then we had to find a chamberlain
for the festival.

112
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,912
I want the volunteers
to rise faster ...

113
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:47,166
They have always done this, children do not
paint something or play with Betty the cow.

114
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,844
- This game dates back to 1972.
- It's nice.

115
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,449
Lindo.

116
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:57,021
Betty the cow, the cow Betty.

117
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:01,794
It is wonderful, ¿Por
what ever you retire?

118
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,640
- Sorry, I ...
- I'm glad we have a volunteer.

119
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:11,289
- No.
- Tammy Sanders, is in
charge of Festibal.

120
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:16,458
- Hey Tammy.
- We are both going to have fun.

121
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:24,012
Betty the cow, the cow Betty.
Bety jump there.

122
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:28,751
Click, lower page, page down,
page down, page down, ok now.

123
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:34,932
As you can see photos here we
are at 16% of the project.

124
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,844
Well, well.

125
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:46,424
What is very good.
We have completed construction
guaranteed.

126
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:49,174
It's fabulous, and it's
great that front.

127
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:54,250
- FEZ rest?
- Show the plans.

128
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,954
Well you re in charge of
Phase 1, which is this.

129
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,793
And this is the phase 2.

130
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:09,307
- ZUD. will remove all the wood?
- Yes.

131
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:20,507
But replace that store
for the better.

132
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:25,550
You know who is the king of this.
Because I love it.

133
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,326
Unfortunately we have to deal with
this, but only this inconvenience.

134
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:34,232
Who invent this with something psychological
is part of the solution

135
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:39,908
but I need someone with
a commitment to this.

136
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,247
Requirement, all that.

137
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,160
- I understand.
- Fabulous!

138
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:48,767
There will be a place for
you in the next 4 years.

139
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:55,485
Z4 years?, Mr.
I have relocated my
family for 1 year.

140
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:59,753
- That's something I do not like.
- My wife and my son ...

141
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:04,539
- Oh, God.
- This is an op
ortunity for you.

142
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,081
Do not leave your salary,
you have worth.

143
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:16,431
- In 10 seconds the bid just 10, 9, 876 543 ...
- Ok.

144
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:18,968
I will.

145
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,530
Dan is right.

146
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:24,947
You're crazy, ¿Qué?

147
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:28,018
Done.

148
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:30,427
Ok, big boy, it's time to leave.

149
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:32,589
That per second that?

150
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:35,297
Adios.

151
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,095
My wife will kill me.

152
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:52,600
Ok we were a family, we make
decisions together.

153
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:56,308
Look, this is a bad thing, but
think of the promotion.

154
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:01,589
Oh, and if anyone needs me
I'll be with my friends.

155
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:04,236
Oh, wait, I have no friend here.

156
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:09,642
Look, guys this is an opportunity to
do something good for the family.

157
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:11,581
And for the environment as well.

158
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,452
How To might cut the entire forest
is good for the environment?

159
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,025
Not so, we live here, we're
the good guys, we will.

160
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:22,697
- Yes, it is the color of money.
- Speaking of money.

161
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:24,973
¿Quién want a new Wii?

162
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:20,397
Oh, come on.

163
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:28,049
Birds.

164
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:39,068
You, go away.

165
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:02,793
Hey Guy, ¿Puedes come to see
your irrigation system?

166
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:04,929
No problem Dan.

167
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,437
Hello.

168
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:10,040
Look daddy is pissed.

169
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,823
I just had a little problem
with the raccoon.

170
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,221
That's funny, and escaped.

171
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:23,107
- Ilarante.
- ¯Sigues upset with me?

172
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:27,646
- ¯Qué what you think?
- Well excuse me for caring
about the environment.

173
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:37,631
I got out, I did thousands of pieces.
Yes, Yes

174
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:43,876
- Oh, now fly the beavers.
- It is the house.

175
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,418
That's a friend of yours.

176
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,997
Hello Mr.

177
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:07,769
I'm Dan Lyman.

178
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:12,042
Listen, I miss our colleague
and thought to call you.

179
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:14,013
Oh, Jesus!

180
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:17,219
¿Todo right?

181
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,604
Come on.

182
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:36,591
Ok, little buddy, let's move on.

183
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,140
Move!

184
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,038
Come on, grain, salt.
Let go, go!

185
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,149
I get late for work.

186
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:02,821
Thank you.

187
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:11,881
Go!

188
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,097
Okay, ¿Cuál is your problem?

189
00:22:32,157 --> 00:22:33,147
Do you want to play?

190
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:36,488
Let's play.

191
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:04,819
Very good. Thou quicisite.

192
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,066
What I do, I already won.

193
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:28,707
- Mr. Lyman.
- Dan, Zest is a kind of joke?

194
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:32,087
- I hate jokes.
- There is good reason.

195
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:34,849
God!

196
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,266
3 losses.

197
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:12,468
PENDING

198
00:24:16,118 --> 00:24:18,519
Come on.

199
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,889
- Mr. Lyman, I'm Dan Sanders.
- ¯Hey, you'll work for me?

200
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:23,123
Yes, but I ...

201
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,673
I'm sick of this place and
I have very hungry.

202
00:24:27,877 --> 00:24:34,346
I'm going to cook, no matter if
you go, I want mo problems ..

203
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:39,624
Clearly something is wrong, because they
say it never arrived at its meeting.

204
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:43,810
Maybe he met an old friend
or an old friend.

205
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:45,711
Thank you.

206
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,984
... And bring the South
African Sanders!

207
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:11,501
I'm Sergeant Wilson.
I Lyman safety

208
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:13,401
because it is the will.

209
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,552
I'm here because I have a
425 call about my order.

210
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:20,521
- ¯Qué is a 425?
- A book.

211
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,501
Ms. now is not a good
time to civilians.

212
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:30,812
- ¯Ese is your car?
- Both know that, Zel is fine?

213
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,521
- Well you tell me.
- ¯Yo I say?

214
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:40,568
If we find this car abandoned
2.7 kilometers of forest.

215
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:42,805
¿Sabe if I should call the
police about my husband?

216
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:46,040
I think we both know you do not
want to call the police.

217
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:48,710
He says that and the next
16 minutes here.

218
00:25:48,955 --> 00:25:51,449
Treating the feeling of
lying in a murder.

219
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:54,393
- ¯Asesinato?
- ¯Qué murder?

220
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:57,039
- You said murder.
- Did not want to tell
me about the murder?

221
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,907
ZES murder?

222
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,048
Come here, go friend.

223
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:06,024
There is a mountain that lies
ahead, climbing and hunting.

224
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:09,424
In the meantime because
you're not my charger.

225
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,603
- Look you have.
- Go is a cap.

226
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:14,736
Dan.

227
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,449
I was so worried about you.

228
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,161
- Oh, Two, ¿Qué happened?
- There was a Abichuela and
then left the raccoon,

229
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,729
And then I lost my
cell phone ...

230
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:30,002
I'm going to call someone.

231
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,850
¿Qué happened, Carian, waiting?

232
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:36,588
That was touching.

233
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:41,793
- Okay. well, I guess you missed.
- Sorry.

234
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:44,743
Dame.

235
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:53,963
Is a small town and I have
eagle eyes in you

236
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:59,939
Yes, do not panic

237
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:15,807
Tomorrow. ... Absolutely it is.

238
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,646
I know.

239
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:22,791
Fabulous.

240
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:26,259
We must be ready for cooking.

241
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:35,115
I see, Mr.
I know it very well.
Have good night.

242
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,591
¿Fué something I said?

243
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:46,610
- ¯Tammy I can pass
- No thanks.

244
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:53,957
Sorry.

245
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:58,866
I should call you first, I do not know
which were being kept thinking.

246
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:02,541
I must wash any idea
how worried I was?

247
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,220
Sorry, I was thinking.

248
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:10,923
It's just that I thought if I keep them
happy I could give you the world.

249
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,267
Dan, we do not want the
world, we want to you.

250
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:20,085
I understand, so if you need
me I'll be in the cabinet.

251
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:27,425
- You have to sleep on the furniture.
- Thank you.

252
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:32,711
I'm busy seeing who is
overseeing the forest.

253
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,250
Well.

254
00:28:36,755 --> 00:28:39,387
I would say more but desperately
need a shower.

255
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:41,961
Working on it.

256
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,899
Very cute.

257
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:50,851
That is all.

258
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:41,390
¿Qué hell ... Hey.

259
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:50,909
Stop doing this.

260
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:02,236
Well run.

261
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:05,980
- ¯Con Who are you talking about?
- There was a crow.

262
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,514
- ¯Cuál crow?
- I blew.

263
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:14,868
That's all my work on
the ground flying.

264
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:19,911
No. .. Yes I'll bring it.

265
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,214
And then back to bed.

266
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:30,968
Damn!

267
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:33,304
Stop!

268
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:02,806
Shut up!

269
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,041
You must be kidding.

270
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:40,150
OK, that does not bother me.

271
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:48,838
No.

272
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:55,479
That's all!

273
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,436
Hello pretty bird.

274
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:08,051
Come bird, come.

275
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:13,855
How nice, you're a good bird.

276
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:23,782
I will return in a bag ...

277
00:32:58,497 --> 00:32:59,487
Mom.

278
00:33:00,234 --> 00:33:01,464
I found it.

279
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,380
Honey there is nothing
going wrong with me.

280
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,647
I'm telling you I'm fine.

281
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:15,566
Ok, but want to scare crows for the
roof is not considered good.

282
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:18,936
ICTY's what you mean exactly?

283
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:23,406
- Tyler, let me talk to your father.
- Of course the goal is that.

284
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:32,770
I think you're going through a process
of stress and conflict.

285
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:41,418
I can not do that, I can not afford
another meeting with Lyman.

286
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,292
The guy has flown hundreds
of miles just to see me.

287
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:50,076
Are you saying that Mr.
Lyman has traveled hundreds
of miles in his jet.

288
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,575
So you can have a
meeting with you.

289
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:52,873
Yes.

290
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:57,718
That's funny, baby was only
a crow kept me awake.

291
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,828
It is a matter outside the city.

292
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:06,704
It will take more than that to me
that this poor bird expires.

293
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:16,428
Nature, nature, nature.

294
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:36,239
Ok, well we all can.
We will continue to see
ourselves beautiful.

295
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,381
Hey we are going faster.

296
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:44,187
3, 2, 1.

297
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,690
Hello.

298
00:36:02,434 --> 00:36:06,534
Mr. Sanders'm happy to report that
everything is ready for this.

299
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:09,948
¿Puedes see some security
against animals ...

300
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,200
That's not good, I'll have
my boys in this, ok.

301
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:19,665
Thank you.

302
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:27,148
Telling you the truth, this promotion
should be bringing some bad luck.

303
00:36:33,703 --> 00:36:38,167
Men without faith believe in anything.
The man with faith believe
in God and have faith.

304
00:36:39,348 --> 00:36:40,782
- That's deep.
- Yes

305
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:49,969
God is San.

306
00:37:10,783 --> 00:37:13,882
Help me.

307
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:19,161
- Get the door lock.
- Assist.

308
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:31,790
¿Puedes say who I am?

309
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:35,996
Clean everything,
clean everything.

310
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:50,433
Oh my God, this is not
what they see ...

311
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:01,615
¿Dónde hell are my clothes?

312
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,985
Nobody would believe it enters the car.
Nobody would believe
it enters the car.

313
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,639
Nobody find you.

314
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:25,536
Get in the car before
someone finds you.

315
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:36,568
Hello. To your after!

¿Hey boys, see you at

318
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:07,935
Go directly to your
home is everything.

319
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:22,000
No again. Forget it.

320
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:23,468

I have it, we bring the cake.

325
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:22,766
Do not want to sound desperate but I can not Mr.

No, friend I'm so sorry.

328
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:41,806
Seriously it's like being stuck
on the Discovery Channel.

329
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:45,472
Do not understand how people
can live in this town.

330
00:41:45,954 --> 00:41:48,013
- Sorry.

345
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,667
I must wash plans for lunch?

346
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:48,380
Dan, the Indians will be here
in 10 days, we need to show

347
00:42:48,556 --> 00:42:50,117
this is a special place.

348
00:42:52,065 --> 00:42:53,761
Think about it ...

349

Wait, we have the festival.

00:43:27,074 --> 00:43:29,979
The festival is a great idea.

356
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:34,113
Well see this is close ...

357

00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:06,024
Bad bird, bad bird.

366

¿Hiciste what I said?

367
00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:11,603

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,864
- Good but not delay.

373
00:44:45,881 --> 00:44:46,711
Bees!

374
00:44:57,004 --> 00:44:58,166

How To is that you're
using my Buso?

377
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:14,300
I had a real bad day.

378
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,612
Do not fool anyone, let
me guess, the raven.

379
00:45:34,622 --> 00:45:35,987
That's hard.

380
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,834
I want someone to see you,
I've got an appointment.

381
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:44,100
Dr. Burr is a local therapist.

382
00:45:44,276 --> 00:45:46,678
Baby, I need sleep.

383
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:49,818
Well I'm going, but one
more episode and go.

384
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:54,252
I hope you can sleep,
I have this.

385
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,596
This will improve your mood.

386
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:03,308
Fungi of the facts and Mr.
Martin.

387
00:46:04,922 --> 00:46:05,911
Try it.

388
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:37,415
Tammy, I think there is
someone on the stairs.

389
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,166
How To's to get in here?

390
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:03,842
Get out of my house!

391
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,636
Tammy awake, I had the
worst nightmare.

392
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,819
No hammer dawn.

393
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:48,269
Oh, no.

394
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,170
Dan.

395
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:17,971
¿Qué you doing?

396
00:48:19,048 --> 00:48:22,510
- Defendendo m house.
- Ok, I need to try to
explain what you mean.

397
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:31,066
Ok, but you do not believe me,
I know things are crazy.

398
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,071
- Trust me.
- I promise.

399
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:34,941
Ok, here goes.

400
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:40,220
Animals love me actions reach.

401
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:42,058
ZY what animal we're
talking about Dan?

402
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:47,271
That's the thing, is better
off an entire forest.

403
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:49,913
- I think skunks.
- ¯Mofetas?

404
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:53,451
If you see this is a damn
that I did this ...

405
00:48:55,962 --> 00:49:00,769
It is something like a
psychological attack.

406
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:05,815
Then the brains of the operation
is a raccoon.

407
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,122
Now I'll take and
will depart at 2.

408
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:14,027
- You've done your homework.
- Yes.

409
00:49:14,337 --> 00:49:16,169
- I have only one question.
- ¯Qué?

410
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:18,675
- Zest superloco?
- You promised.

411
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:19,939
I retract.

412
00:49:21,618 --> 00:49:24,249
- Tyler, turn on the switch.
- No thanks.

413
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:27,294
Ok, then I will do it
in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

414
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:36,414
Tammy.

415
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:43,255
Now let's start with some forms.

416
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:48,669
Tell me what you see here.
The first thing that
comes to your mind.

417
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,448
I know that is not supposed to say
this but it's like an angry skunk.

418
00:49:52,718 --> 00:49:53,984
But that looks like this.

419
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:55,814
Wow.

420
00:49:57,698 --> 00:50:03,574
- ¯Qué about this
- is a bear is a nuisance.

421
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,071
¿Eso help?

422
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:10,691
Well Dan, ¿Cuánto long have
you been afraid of animals?

423
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,124
I have no fear of animals.

424
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:17,906
Dan, Dan, Dan.

425
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,645
The denial is part of nature.

426
00:50:36,482 --> 00:50:41,151
Now I want you to listen carefully
to what I'm going to Dreco.

427
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:46,470
- Animals do not want acabarte.
- I know that animals
do not want to.

428
00:50:48,108 --> 00:50:49,702
- Zen serious?
- Yes

429
00:50:49,978 --> 00:50:53,282
Except for these three
this comes up.

430
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:56,524
These through the door.

431
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:04,538
Dan you are suffering a stress related
and need to find your happy place.

432
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:10,049
Now start closing your eyes.
And taking a deep breath.

433
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:12,728
And now another breath
pronfundo.

434
00:51:13,664 --> 00:51:20,976
Inhale, exahala.
Inhale, exahala.

435
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:37,074
Inhale, exahala.
Inhale, exahala.

436
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:45,394

00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:57,190
- I feel fabulous.
- And you never see
things ¿cierto?

438
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:58,519
No. ..

439
00:52:04,842 --> 00:52:06,142
Dan.

440
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:16,057
Zest right?

441
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:27,019
Thay something bothering you?

442
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:30,323
ZES this animal?

443
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:35,974
Because you and I know that
anything unusual out there.

444
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,248
Dan.

445
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,457
Hey stop the car.

446
00:52:47,302 --> 00:52:48,167
I warn you.

447
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:52,511
Do not, is my car.

448
00:52:52,747 --> 00:52:54,944
You're stealing my car.

449
00:52:55,186 --> 00:52:56,622
No, do not do that.

450
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:04,368
I will delete you!

451
00:53:06,745 --> 00:53:08,042
No, again.

452
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,034
¿Por what I are doing this
to me what have I done?

453
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:25,946
Wait.

454
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:38,274
It almost hits the ball.

455
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,919
You have to make an angle,
there you have it.

456
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:42,816
OK.

457
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:44,516
- There it is. Hit.
- Ok.

458
00:53:46,031 --> 00:53:49,197
You know we can play this
after playing sports.

459
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:51,371
ZSI, but what is funny
about that?

460
00:53:51,677 --> 00:53:54,148
Amber, ¿Cuánto time
you live here?

461
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:58,288
- I was born here Ms. Sanders.
- Oh, Zen serious?

462
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,531
- I love it here.
- It is not.

463
00:54:03,002 --> 00:54:04,231
Ms. Sanders.

464
00:54:18,936 --> 00:54:19,906
Dan.

465
00:54:21,944 --> 00:54:23,172
The therapy was well.

466
00:54:30,128 --> 00:54:31,620
¿Qué happened?

467
00:54:31,965 --> 00:54:37,376
If you really want to know, I was attacked
by a raccoon in the car and another.

468
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:38,976
You must be Amber.

469
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,208
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

470
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,719
Sorry I need to remove
a leech from my ...

471
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:46,486
My God.

472
00:54:49,303 --> 00:54:50,100
Dan.

473
00:54:52,944 --> 00:54:55,279
I want to say that animals achieved.
We

474
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:58,849
- Do not know why I do not believe me.
- Because raccoons do not try.

475
00:54:59,024 --> 00:55:00,721
Well this did it and
I'll prove it.

476
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:20,335
- Hello son.
- Hello Dad.

477
00:55:20,873 --> 00:55:22,341
Zest right?

478
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,144
We both know I'm beyond the ok.

479
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:28,344
You see I have these Indian industry
'coming from the city.

480
00:55:28,856 --> 00:55:31,953
And I have a raccoon antisocial
fuck my life.

481
00:55:32,464 --> 00:55:33,762
But nobody wants to believe.

482
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,639
Well I do not think
you're crazy.

483
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:44,748
Amber gave me this book.
From a local history.

484
00:55:46,228 --> 00:55:47,924
I think there is something
you should see.

485
00:55:49,936 --> 00:55:52,533
You're not the first person
to have that experience.

486
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:56,348
Natuka The first was a man
of the caves in 9000 BC.

487
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:06,202
Sn disappears trace.
And many in history have
tried and failed.

488
00:56:06,606 --> 00:56:08,908
The Crete, the Vikings.

489
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:10,478
How nice ...

490
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:13,952
Jared, the ancestor.

491
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:19,799
And Stan hippie.

492
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,867
Hey little buddy.

493
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:28,344
ZA where you going with this?

494
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:32,024
Look I made a lot of
studies and see.

495
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,795
Your friend Lyman has a
privilege of Wasington.

496
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:37,669
He can not cut and build on
what is a forest reserve.

497
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:42,245
LYMAN COMPANY MAKES PURCHASE LAND
IN FOREST PROTECTED RISKS.

498
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:47,961
- I'm sure that's not it.
- It is.

499
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,265
Okay, you're building
in a nature reserve.

500
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:53,200
And frankly you take
out to nature.

501
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:56,675
¿Me're saying that animals struggle
to arrest me for not doing that?

502
00:56:56,882 --> 00:57:01,882
No, I think I passed that.
I believe that animals
seek revenge.

503
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:12,908
I do not bite.

504
00:57:25,712 --> 00:57:26,578
Gotcha.

505
00:57:37,439 --> 00:57:39,876
Now I see you're
not fast enough.

506
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:49,764
Oh, there you are.

507
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:52,997
Hello little friend.

508
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,817
Look, this could be you.
It is now.

509
00:58:11,814 --> 00:58:13,011
Is your friend ...

510
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:54,764
No, no, stop that.

511
00:59:05,865 --> 00:59:07,059
I hate them!

512
00:59:19,996 --> 00:59:22,593
Hello, Zhas seen my husband
this morning?

513
00:59:22,836 --> 00:59:26,470
Ms. Sanders Sorry, I have no
time, has seen my daughter.

514
00:59:27,747 --> 00:59:29,579
That is something that
can not get worse.

515
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:32,014
No Aloque. Aloque not.

516
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:33,650
Someone came.

517
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,584
Well, well, well.

518
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,563
They have no idea what
is happening today.

519
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:53,460
Position of guilt.

520
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,071
I know I canzo of their
show or their pets.

521
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:04,015
I do not want to talk more.

522
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:07,691
Dan.

523
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:16,653
¿Dónde?

524
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,217
They must be kidding.

525
01:00:21,196 --> 01:00:24,262
Stan, Stan. ¯Cariño're inside?

526
01:00:24,805 --> 01:00:26,364
Is there any way I fall.

527
01:00:26,911 --> 01:00:29,904
Mr. Sanders not worry it will
go down in a little.

528
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:34,423
Served.

529
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,825
You might want to
cover your eyes.

530
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:44,639
Bring the hose.

531
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:50,222
Fuego.

532
01:01:03,457 --> 01:01:05,483
- Zest good boss?
- If I feel great.

533
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:08,359
Nothing like a shower on
a freezing cold morning.

534
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:11,367
They have made good progress
in these home.

535
01:01:12,076 --> 01:01:13,806
Pienza at his home in Lyman ...

536
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,721
You're dead.

537
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:22,392
Dan.

538
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,444
This ends now!

539
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,389
I do not know where you think
it goes without my keys.

540
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,907
And he left everything.

541
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,941
This ends now.

542
01:02:04,623 --> 01:02:08,826
3 ... 2 ...

543
01:02:12,908 --> 01:02:14,640
Do it again.

544
01:02:21,861 --> 01:02:24,025
I can not do.
I am not a murderer.

545
01:02:25,135 --> 01:02:27,607
Let's just fix this.

546
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:42,127
I came to fix it and you ...

547
01:02:45,246 --> 01:02:46,509
Oh God!

548
01:02:51,994 --> 01:02:53,521
You do not care about me ...

549
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:19,342
You fell.

550
01:03:23,062 --> 01:03:25,193
Lucky for you I came.

551
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,181
- Zest dead?
- Not only gave him
the gun reassuring.

552
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:34,812
You can download
a tiger with it.

553
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:36,357
¿Cuántas more you have?

554
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:38,788
I have a whole house full
of these things.

555
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:45,739
- Zen what you're thinking
- I am thinking of
cleaning my house.

556
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,151
It's time.

557
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:55,559
They start their cages.

558
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,868
MODEL HOUSE

559
01:04:04,353 --> 01:04:05,719
More boys.

560
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:07,620
Put them on top.

561
01:04:08,228 --> 01:04:09,093
Ok.

562
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:11,861
¿Qué happened to the other?

563
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:35,079
Take him away boys, take them.

564
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:39,195
I have not had turkey.

565
01:04:46,813 --> 01:04:48,714
- Good morning, Mr. Sanders.
- Good morning.

566
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,859
There are no raccoons.

567
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:15,398
You know with the animals confined
and under control.

568
01:05:15,642 --> 01:05:17,738
- I think that we will reduce months.
- That would be fabulous.

569
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,352
- No account yet something else?
- Please sit down.

570
01:05:20,553 --> 01:05:23,617
Thanks, Dan said I was going
to explain the details.

571
01:05:24,362 --> 01:05:28,461
- First place has done a fantastic job.
- Thanks.

572
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,474
Only a few things.

573
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,681
We are dealing with the best.

574
01:05:35,086 --> 01:05:40,154
And this whole thing
from the trees.

575
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:48,071
Please none of those things
better be disturbed.

576
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:50,344
Sure.

577
01:05:51,354 --> 01:05:55,591
- Oh, I see that they are dancers.
- Great idea.

578
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,467
Well done.

579
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:01,733
You owe me $ 25, if
25, do not forget.

580
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,030
Wait.

581
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:23,416
- ZLO leave?
- You're kidding,
I love running.

582
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,827
Well we even need 2 miles.

583
01:06:32,443 --> 01:06:33,344
Amazing.

584
01:06:33,547 --> 01:06:35,916
Hey, How To's your daddy?
ZSE feel better?

585
01:06:36,085 --> 01:06:39,059
Much seems to have
turned the corner.

586
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:43,632
Look, I know you see it as Mr.
Ego does not help.

587
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:47,139
But this saved the forest,
it feels good.

588
01:06:47,977 --> 01:06:51,645
Well, I do not think your
dad is a bad guy.

589
01:06:52,888 --> 01:06:55,623
Just for what it does.

590
01:06:56,063 --> 01:06:58,865
There will be trees in the Festibal,
that should tell you something.

591
01:06:59,036 --> 01:07:00,130
Yes.

592
01:07:03,179 --> 01:07:04,841
Amber, ¿Todo right?

593
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:13,160
Yeah, you know, I was just thinking
in the middle, my dance.

594
01:07:14,804 --> 01:07:18,768
And no one has invited me.
And you kiss me.

595
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:32,874
¿Todo right?

596
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,076
Hello!

597
01:07:57,163 --> 01:07:59,760
- Whatever.
- There must be a mistake.

598
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,404
Seriously, it makes perfect
sense to me.

599
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:06,273
- It's a good job of your father. 
- Amber expected.

600
01:08:07,186 --> 01:08:08,176
Just leave me alone.

601
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:10,415
- Do not blame me it was my dad.
- I intereza.

602
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:21,242
Stay boy, do not have all day.

603
01:08:22,987 --> 01:08:24,923
Here it is, waiting.

604
01:08:25,123 --> 01:08:28,689
Dan you have to do something, your boss
is ruining the whole festival.

605
01:08:28,867 --> 01:08:32,739
- Meat is not so bad.
- Yes, because everything was
going to be a disaster.

606
01:08:35,313 --> 01:08:36,782
But everything I say
my boss has done.

607
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:42,092
- ¯Cuándo hibas me to say?
- Tell you.

608
01:08:42,631 --> 01:08:48,097
- On your forest eviction.
- Not what you think, ok.

609
01:08:48,376 --> 01:08:50,745
It is only a couple of days.
... That's then

610
01:08:52,284 --> 01:08:52,910
¿Luego what?

611
01:08:53,486 --> 01:08:56,118
Liberate animals and everything
will be fine.

612
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:00,166
Know what I think are better
now because they are safe.

613
01:09:03,141 --> 01:09:07,812
You are so blind to the facts.
Working for a company ecologist

614
01:09:08,052 --> 01:09:10,853
giving orders to kill
the animals.

615
01:09:11,058 --> 01:09:12,493
You are so hypocritical.

616
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:17,169
Tyler ...

617
01:09:19,276 --> 01:09:20,142
Wait a minute.

618
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,646
¿Qué I'm the bad guy? Come on.

619
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:29,090
No, I'm tired.

620
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,242
It's working.

621
01:09:55,188 --> 01:09:57,387
They know that my family is
completely against me.

622
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:00,495
¿Por Why me?

623
01:10:01,202 --> 01:10:02,729
¿Qué have I done?

624
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,542
Well I try to talk to a raccoon.

625
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,642
As if you understand. "

626
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:12,383
And your children.

627
01:10:22,282 --> 01:10:24,114
I must wash a family?

628
01:10:27,594 --> 01:10:31,260
All this time has been
protecting me.

629
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,022
Festibal ROCKY SPRING SPRING

630
01:10:49,174 --> 01:10:51,702
SPRING FOREST Festibal

631
01:11:07,815 --> 01:11:09,373
Well do not complain.

632
01:11:09,751 --> 01:11:11,187
Enter.

633
01:11:12,391 --> 01:11:15,056
I love tickling, tickle master.

634
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:20,430
We think we're doing
reengineering.

635
01:11:22,212 --> 01:11:23,545
It's a good thing.

636
01:11:29,096 --> 01:11:29,720
Now.

637
01:11:30,697 --> 01:11:34,469
They try to destroy the forest.
Inform yourself, is big.

638
01:11:43,693 --> 01:11:45,093
Amber, Amber.

639
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:47,165
- ¯Qué wrong?
- ¯Qué you doing?

640
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:50,167
Well I continue my way to not
end up with the forest.

641
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:54,312
dcho ¿Bueno never have not returned
my calls or my text messages?

642
01:11:55,318 --> 01:11:58,257
Excuse me if I am a little
busy with my dad.

643
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,656
If you want to do something
you have to do it right.

644
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,553
Stop to end the forest.
They are destroying the forest.

645
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:17,464
Smug.

646
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,534
Here we can raise more things
and get on with the markets.

647
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:25,405
And this is a new concept.
Speaking of the economic
conscience.

648
01:12:25,585 --> 01:12:28,557
Dan's wife. Tammy Sanders.

649
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:35,704
Thanks in first place this Festibal
has nothing to do with the forest.

650
01:12:37,045 --> 01:12:37,671
Not true.

651
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:41,642
Oh, and this is the son of Dan.
Tyler.

652
01:12:41,854 --> 01:12:45,259
- Tyler ¿Qué this?
- You know we have found that
they give it to the forest.

653
01:12:47,099 --> 01:12:51,906
- Busy day.
- Tyler I know you must be
very upset right now.

654
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:55,448
- It has nothing to do with you dad.
- Van to kill animals.

655
01:12:55,684 --> 01:12:56,846
zMate?

656
01:12:58,189 --> 01:13:01,027
There must be some kind of
error in communication.

657
01:13:01,262 --> 01:13:05,068
Lyman industry does not kill animals.
Only we will relocate.

658
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,268
Yes but that is the same as killing them.
Will leave no trees to animals.

659
01:13:08,446 --> 01:13:11,748
Enough!
Heard everything you
needed to hear.

660
01:13:12,153 --> 01:13:14,624
Lyman earned it.

661
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:16,555
- ¯Qué?
- ¯Qué?

662
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:19,065
¿Qué about animals?

663
01:13:19,302 --> 01:13:22,800
Fewer animals, less discomfort
only take charge of them.

664
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:23,807
¿Qué?

665
01:13:23,945 --> 01:13:26,382
Great, because it is just like
the contract says so.

666
01:13:31,263 --> 01:13:33,095
- Now you're happy
- Hey guys.

667
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,964
- Congratulations, well done dad.
- Wait.

668
01:13:36,173 --> 01:13:39,203
Reubicabamos I thought that if the
animals would be no problem.

669
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,644
I'll take care of something.

670
01:13:46,028 --> 01:13:46,688
ZA where are you going?

671
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:48,392
There is something I have to do.

672
01:13:53,076 --> 01:13:56,276
You were the one who created all this.
Now I want to do

673
01:13:56,585 --> 01:13:58,612
is that you continue as you did.
Come on.

674
01:14:23,778 --> 01:14:27,273
Guys around here for the photo.
Say whiskey.

675
01:14:27,586 --> 01:14:30,023
Come on, come down here.

676
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,636
That is all.

677
01:15:00,826 --> 01:15:02,590
Hey you still!

678
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,797
Many of you Do not panic.

679
01:15:17,428 --> 01:15:19,366
Thanks to the band.

680
01:15:22,907 --> 01:15:25,435
Ok, just kidding.

681
01:15:29,722 --> 01:15:30,484
Thank you.

682
01:15:31,225 --> 01:15:34,859
Friends and neighbors.'m
Neal Lyman.

683
01:15:35,768 --> 01:15:40,802
And for us Industry Lyman has been a privilege
to be part of the community.

684
01:15:41,782 --> 01:15:48,215
Thank you.
Today is a new start
for this small town.

685
01:15:49,098 --> 01:15:53,402
- You can call bad, irrelevant.
- ¯Irrelevante?

686
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:59,120
2 teams of raccoons.
I see nature as it is.

687
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,981
The beginning of a
new leadership.

688
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:07,398
Thank you.

689
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:13,710
And here is a great man.
Who will change their
little world.

690
01:16:15,289 --> 01:16:16,587
So with this ...

691
01:16:18,629 --> 01:16:23,230
Stop the predation environment.

692
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:31,086
People, Tyler here, right,
you were right.

693
01:16:34,397 --> 01:16:40,036
He is a fraud.
Not even have thought
of anything natural.

694
01:16:41,947 --> 01:16:44,977
- No part of this.
- Very well.

695
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:47,317
That's something small ok.

696
01:16:49,363 --> 01:16:57,280
Forced my family that I mudarna
here a bit of fresh air.

697
01:16:58,617 --> 01:16:59,449
Having a better life.

698
01:16:59,653 --> 01:17:01,486
I was just trying to
grow in my career.

699
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:07,231
I came here because I thought
it would make a community.

700
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:12,201
But the truth is that
I just felt one.

701
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:16,620
I've seen, I've seen.

702
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:23,497
Safety, safety, please.

703
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:29,340
Ok, ¿Qué if I said that the forest
will have 100 million dollars?

704
01:17:31,086 --> 01:17:32,648
¿Quién is winning now?

705
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:36,158
Do not listen.

706
01:17:41,243 --> 01:17:45,913
Ok, folks, we'll see that Mr.
Gupta sign the contract.

707
01:17:48,993 --> 01:17:51,965

I have them, I have them.

710
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,421
Go, go!

711
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,563
- Ok, here.
- I will not sign this.

712
01:18:27,312 --> 01:18:28,678
- Do it, do it.
- No, no.

713
01:18:28,881 --> 01:18:30,110
- Forget it.
- Do it.

714
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:31,513
Well.

715
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,492
Please.

716
01:18:46,153 --> 01:18:47,050
Zahora what?

717
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:57,310
Oh, well.

718
01:18:59,315 --> 01:19:00,248
Mira.

719
01:19:05,093 --> 01:19:08,499
It is the raccoon.

720
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:28,503
- That sucks.
- You know.

721
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:03,681
- Zahora believe me?
- I never doubted ...

722
01:20:10,302 --> 01:20:13,744
I remember my first said ...

723
01:20:31,349 --> 01:20:33,820
- I have the key.
- Watch a portfolio.

724
01:20:37,196 --> 01:20:43,370
Well ...

4 years ago is ...

725
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:11,696
Tammy.

726
01:21:13,808 --> 01:21:15,072
Adios raccoon.

727
01:21:31,049 --> 01:21:32,745
Oh my God. ... I'll kill you

728
01:21:49,419 --> 01:21:52,359
Come strong, steady ...
well done.

729
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:03,780
It's not what you think.

730
01:22:08,964 --> 01:22:10,763
Sanders Hey, right back.

731
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:17,905
Bruce Lee emerged from the tomb.

732
01:22:43,573 --> 01:22:45,041
Come on. Come on.

733
01:22:46,213 --> 01:22:48,740
I think it's fair. What to eat.

734
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:50,084
It is good that too.

735
01:22:50,589 --> 01:22:54,187
That curse is wrong.

736
01:22:59,206 --> 01:23:04,776
¿Dije was sorry?
I had my priorities
completely wrong.

737
01:23:08,527 --> 01:23:11,592
- And just ... I love you Tyler.
- Dad, it's cool, ok.

738
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:15,536
- Tyler hug your dad.

739
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:18,741
Do it, do it.

01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:23,825
Tyler.

741
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:25,063
Come on.

Oh, really.

01:23:38,124 --> 01:23:39,720
This went well.

745
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,359
Everything will be fine.

746
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,435
AFTER 3 MONTHS
