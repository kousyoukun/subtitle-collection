1
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:46,662
Not tomorrow. The day after. Right.

2
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:49,457
You, me, Gary, Brad. We'll be teeing off at...

3
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:52,126
- I like Gary.
- Doctor, I'm in a hurry...

4
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:57,631
We'll tee off at 7:30. If you're not there
because of Gary, come on. I gotta go.

5
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,634
Am I missing something?

6
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:04,138
Why a head X-ray
when the man was bitten on the hand?

7
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,600
The patient was in a bar fight.
He was admitted at six.

8
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:11,395
That's 6:00am.
That's when I started my shift.

9
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,564
Where is he now? I'd like to see him.

10
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,276
- They moved him. A night nurse...
- Page me when you find him.

11
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:19,570
Sure.

12
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,614
I'll do that.

13
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:25,576
Cora, can you locate a patient for me?

14
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,912
Hey, Ana. Sure.

15
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,206
- Edward Solomon?
- Yep.

16
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:34,710
- Aren't you off?
- An hour ago.

17
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,841
Here he is. They had him backwards.
Solomon Edward. He's in ICU.

18
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,344
- From a bite?
- I don't know what from.

19
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:46,263
Toxicology's working him up tomorrow.

20
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:49,892
- I'm going. Can you let Dr. Dandewar know?
- Sure.

21
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:53,312
- Thanks.
- Did you talk to Luis about Sunday?

22
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:55,689
- I will. Night, Cora.
- Night.

23
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,543
- Hey.
- Hey, Ana.

24
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,629
- Let's go. It's starting early.

25
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,049
- Great. Later.
Let's go, let's go!

26

'... an unconfirmed... '
'... not an isolated... '

27
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:51,537
Hey, Vivian.

28
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,248
- Look, I can go backwards.
- Let me see.

29
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,752
Hey, that's amazing.

30
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:01,088
Maybe tomorrow I'll do
a few backward laps with you.

31
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,258
- OK.
- Careful, now, I gotta pull in.

32
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,678
- Say hey to your mom for me, OK?
- OK.

33
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,481
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

34
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:21,484
You missed it.
They just cut the mailman loose.

35
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,694
No, Richie? The chubby one?

36
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,114
He had such a sweet voice.
I can't believe that.

37
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:32,745
Hey, you.

38
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:34,955
Hey, you. Come here.

39
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,838
- How'd it go today?
- Not bad. You?

40
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:46,258
Good. I'm trading shifts with Cora
so if I take Sunday,

41
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,470
I'll have a three-day weekend
at the end of the month.

42
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:52,223
- Is that OK?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:58,145
I think Cora has a new guy
she's keeping secret.

44
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,272
Really? Wow. Lucky her.

45
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:04,610
I thought maybe you'd gone out with the girls.

46

146
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,518
I need to suture that.

147
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:07,980
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

148
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:18,824
- Find someplace else.
- We just need a place...

149
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:22,953
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- There is no place else.

150
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,791
Tough shit. This is our place
and you can't stay here.

Yeah. And you already trashed Metropolis.

- His arm...
- Those things are down there.

These are your problems, not mine.

155
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,390
If I put my foot up your ass,
would that be your problem?

156
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:46,727
Hey, asshole, I'm the one
pointing the gun at you.

157
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,521
He is a cop, CJ.

158
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:52,024
- So what?

159
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:55,069
We're not gonna cause any trouble.

160
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:58,864
Just let us stay here
for a little while. Please.

161
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,916
OK. Come out slowly
and give your weapons to Bart and Terry.

162
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,085
- Don't do it.
- You must be crazy.

163
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:14,380
You can take your ass on over
to Quality Inn, Shaq.

164
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:17,758
Huh? You want to do that?

165
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:21,011
Let's go.

166
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,389
Hey, don't give him that gun.

167
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:30,771
Fuck.

168
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,694
Smart move.

169
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:41,407
'Nobody knows what's going on.
There's a lot of blood and bodies.

170
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:45,619
'There's a slew of fires.
We're going back to a live picture now.'

171
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:55,880
'One second. Ma'am, are you American? '

172
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:04,847
All right. Let's go, guys.

173
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:09,060
Come on. Get your own little TV.
Come on. Let's go.

174
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:15,149
Excuse me.
Please. Is there a restroom?

175
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:17,485
No. You're staying here.

176
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:21,447
Then tell us where in here you'd like us to piss.

177
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:27,036
It's around the corner, that way.

178
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,622
Whoa, where are you going?

179
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,999
She's not going anywhere alone.

180
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:36,754
"She's not going anywhere..." This is a
fucking nursery school! Go with them.

181
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:40,007
'I'm Bill Vibert for 23-V Cable News.

188
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:01,737
Twitcher!

189
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:04,365
Now, that is one cool motherfucker.

190
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:08,160
He's still bleeding. I need to stitch his arm.

191
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:11,706
- You a fucking doctor?
- No, I'm a fucking nurse.

192
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,463
- 'I know some of these people.'
- First aid kit's in the office.

'What are you gonna do? It's gotta be done.'

194

- Huh? What did I tell you boys?
- 'Get those bodies off the truck! '

195
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:30,099
America always sorts its shit out.

196
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:43,195
You're lucky. He could have bitten it off.

our search-and-rescue teams will find you.'

My brother's there. He's waiting for me.

203

What's the holdup, darling?

204
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:50,596
Hm?

205
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:56,727
So what's the plan?

206
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:00,106
The plan is you drink a tall glass
of shut-the-fuck-up.

207
00:29:00,147 --> 00:29:03,317
- OK. That's one idea.

208
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:08,656
What about locking this place down?
Sooner or later, they'll get in.

209
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,285
That's good. I hadn't thought of that.

210
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:18,457
No doubt. You probably already thought
about putting a sign up on the roof

211
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:21,836
cos there's still planes in the air.

212
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:25,381
Might be good to let them know we're alive.

213
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:41,355
We can get paint from Case Hardware.
Use doors to board up the weak spots.

214
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:43,899
That's a solid plan.

215
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:46,152
CJ, is it?

216
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,031
- Yeah.
- All right, CJ.

217
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:02,293
Listen up. I'm giving
everybody a job and I expect you to do it.

218
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:05,212
I don't want to see any half-assin'.

219
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:08,841
You can start by cleaning up
that mess you made in Metropolis.

220
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:13,512
Hey, CJ, look!

221
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:15,181
Terry.

222
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:17,183
Look at Ben Cozine.

223
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:23,481
Hey, Ben. Ben!

224
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,900
Christ. Look at him.

225
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:29,403
Look, he's a twitcher.

226
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:35,993
TV says you gotta shoot 'em in the head.

227
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,162
TV said a lot of things.

228
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:42,083
Fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.

229
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:03,396
Let's go. Let's get to work.

230
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:08,109
Holy shit.

231
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:33,134
Let's do it.
All right, let's pick him up, then.

232
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:36,554
Ready? One, two, three.

233
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,597
On two. All right?

234
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:41,308
One, two.

235
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:46,772
What are they?

236
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:49,942
I don't know. Why are they coming here?

237
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:55,114
Memory, maybe. Instinct.
Maybe they're coming for us.

238
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:05,416
Look over there.
There's someone on the roof.

239
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:11,839
His name's Andy. He's alone.

240
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,760
He may as well be on the moon.

241
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,845
Poor guy.

242
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,641
What's he pointing at?

243
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:27,646
- Helicopter.
- Hey, it's coming.

244
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:32,902
Fuckin' A, man!

245
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:35,654
Hey!
Hey!

246
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:38,574
- Hey!
- Where's he...?

247
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:41,702
Please... What's he doing? Where's he going?

248
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,169
No. I mean, they saw us, so...

249
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:54,548
They'll be coming back, baby.
Don't worry. They'll send somebody.

250
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,011
It's safe here.
We'll just wait for them to come back.

251
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,117
I don't want anybody
sneaking around and stealing shit.

252
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,371
Comprende?

253
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,375
Sweet dreams.

254
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,758
Those assholes are gonna get us killed.

255
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,179
We have to do something.

256
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:46,225
I'm not doing anything
to create problems for Luda and me.

257
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:49,603
- The helicopter's coming back soon.
- I hope so.

258
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:55,609
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's means it might come and it might not.

259
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:58,946
What do you mean?
You said it was coming back!

260
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:02,992
- We have to get to hospital.
- Baby, listen. Don't worry, OK?

261
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:06,370
This guy, he doesn't know shit.

262
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,539
All right? It's coming back.

263
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:14,628
My man, I hear you talking a lot,
you're always saying something,

264
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,298
who the fuck are you that we should listen?

265
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:21,510
Were you like in the Marines?
What the fuck do you do?

266
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:26,557
I sell televisions at Best Buy.

267
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,980
Wow.

268
00:34:34,565 --> 00:34:40,029
Hey, Officer, how do you like
following a guy that sells TVs?

269
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:43,491
About as much as I like
following a guy who steals them.

270
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:50,122
I'm not following anyone.
I'm going to Fort Pastor to get my brother.

I would have tapped that shit.

What?

317
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:31,427
The bathroom in here is fake, it doesn't work.

318
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:37,850
- I'll tell CJ.
- I'm telling you.

319
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:04,001
You're the type of cat that goes to church
and all that shit, right?

320
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:06,128
Yeah, I do all that shit.

321
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:11,550
So what do you think?

322
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,679
What is this? Is this the end of times?

323
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:19,725
Cos if it is, I'm fucked.

324
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:23,521
I'm serious. I've done some bad things.

325
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:29,110
Oh, I get it. You saw hell yesterday,

326
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:33,447
now you're scared of going to hell
for all the bad things you've done.

327
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,574
Go in the stall, say five Hail Marys,

328
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:38,953
wipe your ass,
and you and God can call it even.

329
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:51,132
You think I feel like I deserve to be here?

330
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:54,135
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't.

331
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:55,970
And I'm cool with that.

332
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:59,974
But that's not it.
I feel like I'm here for another reason.

333
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:06,856
I feel like I'm here
to bring that baby on this earth

334
00:40:06,856 --> 00:40:09,650
and give it everything that I never had.

335
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:17,450
I just want the opportunity to change things.

336
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:44,977
Shit!

337
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,072
CJ!

338
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:59,450
How did you get out?
Who said you could loot the stores?

339
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:02,912
- What are we going to do about that truck?
- Nothing.

340
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:07,458
- There's people in it.
- How do you know they're not fucked up?

341
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,669
- For one thing, they're driving a truck.

342
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:12,755
Oh, and shooting guns.

343
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:17,843
We might let the wrong ones in.
Then I'm dead. And I don't want to die.

344
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:22,973
- Who are the wrong ones?
- Nobody here is sick. It stays that way.

345
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:25,726
- I think...
- I did not ask for your opinion!

346
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:28,771
- If you want to argue, argue with this.
- Relax.

347
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:31,023
Shut your fucking mouth.

348
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:35,903
- Move the gun.
- You can't turn them away. They'll die.

349
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:39,198
Tough shit. Self-defense.

350
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:42,576
- I won't kill anybody.
- I'll kill you.

351
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:46,330
- Stop it, CJ. Don't do this.
- Shut up!

352
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:48,749
I'll kill all of you to stay alive.

353
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:51,043
Get the fucking gun out of my face!

354
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:55,339
- Oh. You got a mouth on you.
- Somebody should show her how to use it.

355
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:07,268
- Is there a holding cell?
- Yeah. Back of the security room.

356
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:11,188
That's real good.
You're gonna get us all killed, dumb-ass!

357
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,274
Fucking traitor.

358
00:42:13,315 --> 00:42:15,943
Get off me.

359
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:18,279
I hope you got a good plan.

360
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:21,615
Come on.

361
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:38,132
- Hey!
- Through here.

362
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:46,807
- I can't see a damn thing.
- Me, either.

363
00:42:50,478 --> 00:42:52,938
Why is he backing up the truck?

364
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:05,242
- Through here!
- Hey!

365
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:10,164
Shit.

366
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:12,458
What the fuck?

367
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,253
- We gotta go out there.
- Throw that bullshit out of your head.

368
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:18,464
That's not part of the plan.

369
00:43:18,506 --> 00:43:20,966
Change of plan. I'll open the door.

370
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:22,468
No.

371
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,929
OK. One, two...

372
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,680
- Don't do it, man.
...three.

373
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:30,851
Come on, man.

374
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:32,436
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

375
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:38,984
Shoot them in the head!

376
00:43:39,694 --> 00:43:41,862
I don't see anybody.

377
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,865
- Get back inside!
- Get back inside!

378
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:49,120
- Here you go.
- There are six more people in the truck!

379
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:50,996
Andre!

380
00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:12,935
Thank God. I couldn't stay
in that fucking truck anymore.

381
00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:20,276
Anybody who's injured,
go to Metropolis. I'll take a look at you.

382
00:44:20,317 --> 00:44:22,737
Let me take a look at her.

383
00:44:23,863 --> 00:44:26,198
Can you help me? What's your name?

384
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,578
Glen. Yeah, sure.
Just give me a second to collect myself.

385
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:33,080
- Thanks.
- OK.

386
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:36,208
Wait in there. I'll look at your leg.

387
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:39,253
- Can you hold this?
- Yeah.

388
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,381
- We're just going right there.
- Oh, my arm.

389
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:44,842
We'll make you nice and comfortable.

390
00:44:44,884 --> 00:44:47,261
We got plenty of food and water.

391
00:44:48,095 --> 00:44:51,015
- Help should be along soon.

392
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:55,102
Help? You hear that from the same jackass
who said to go to St. Verbena?

393
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:57,104
- The church downtown?
- Yeah.

394
00:44:57,146 --> 00:45:02,943
It's the first place I went. Some dipshit on
the radio said it was safe. He was wrong.

395
00:45:02,985 --> 00:45:04,612
That's where you got them?

396
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:09,408
I got a call on the CB from Glen
saying these folks were in the chapel.

397
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:13,204
- He's a priest?
- No, he plays the organ.

398
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:16,374
I was in the neighborhood so I picked them up.

399
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,252
- Well done.
- Thanks.

400
00:45:20,294 --> 00:45:24,757
Excuse me, when you two fellows
are done blowing each other,

401
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:27,718
maybe Davy Crockett can tell us the deal.

402
00:45:28,844 --> 00:45:30,721
Since the TVs went down...

403
00:45:30,763 --> 00:45:34,517
- Excuse me. Whose rig is that?
- It's mine.

404
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:37,895
- You mind if I borrow it?
- I'm not using it.

405
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:40,439
- Keys?
- They're in the cab.

406
00:45:40,481 --> 00:45:45,736
- The truck won't make it to Fort Pastor.
- Forget it. That place is fucked.

407
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:48,489
- Bloodbath city.
- How do you know?

408
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:51,242
We just came from there.

409
00:45:51,283 --> 00:45:53,911
- Is everyone there dead?
- Dead-ish.

410
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:58,416
- Is everyone there dead?
- Yeah.

411
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:02,837
In the sense that
they all sort of fell down and then...

412
00:46:02,878 --> 00:46:05,172
- I have to see.
- You won't make it.

413
00:46:05,214 --> 00:46:07,508
...got up and...
- I'll get as far as I can.

414
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,177
- One foot.
...started eating each other.

415
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:13,055
- I'll take my chances.
- Don't be an idiot.

416
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:18,310
Please. The people here could use your help.

417
00:46:20,229 --> 00:46:23,024
Fuck y'all.

418
00:46:25,568 --> 00:46:29,697
It's nice to see
you've all bonded through this disaster.

419
00:47:41,143 --> 00:47:45,189
- Hey. You need anything?
- No, we're fine.

420
00:47:45,231 --> 00:47:47,400
He's got a bite on his hand.

421
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:57,493
- She's cold.

422
00:47:57,535 --> 00:48:00,287
That's good, right?

423
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,957
I don't know. It's weird.

424
00:48:02,998 --> 00:48:05,960
An infection this bad
usually comes with a fever.

425
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:11,632
That guy's arm looks pretty bad.
You should check it out.

426
00:48:11,674 --> 00:48:16,137
- All right. Stay with her for a minute.

427
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:23,602
- Let me take a look at that.
- I'm fine, really.

428
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:29,066
They don't hurt much. Tucker could use you
more than me. His ankle's cut pretty bad.

429
00:48:29,108 --> 00:48:31,569
I'll just clean it up a bit.

430
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,904
- You OK?

431
00:48:33,946 --> 00:48:37,199
Ma'am, can I get you something?
Like a glass of water?

432
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,914
Ana! Ana, come here!

433
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:11,275
Anyone know her name?

434
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:16,489
Died without a name?

435
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:19,450
Damn.

436
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:21,994
You wanna use the other room?

437
00:49:26,832 --> 00:49:28,834
Holy shit!

438
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:45,768
Holy shit.

439
00:49:47,812 --> 00:49:49,855
Holy shit.

440
00:49:54,443 --> 00:49:56,904
I think it's the bites.

441
00:49:56,946 --> 00:50:01,283
Frank said she was walking on her own
five hours ago.

442
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:04,578
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.

443
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,080
How do you know?

444
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:10,167
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse, she was gone. Then...

445
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:12,878
Yesterday I saw the same thing.

446
00:50:15,214 --> 00:50:17,717
I think that's why it spread so fast.

447
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:22,555
All right.

448
00:50:24,682 --> 00:50:27,226
So who else in the group is bitten?

449
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:30,396
- Frank for sure.
- And the one with the foot?

450
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:33,357
Tucker? He says no, he fell.

451
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:35,943
So it's Frank. Tall guy, right?

452
00:50:35,985 --> 00:50:39,030
Right. So we have to quarantine him.

453
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:41,032
Where do we do that?

454
00:50:41,073 --> 00:50:43,451
There must be a place in here.

455
00:50:43,492 --> 00:50:45,995
Then what?

456
00:50:46,037 --> 00:50:48,039
I don't know. But...

457
00:50:48,748 --> 00:50:51,250
It's too dangerous to keep him here.

458
00:50:55,004 --> 00:50:58,924
What are we talking about?
Are we talking about killing him?

459
00:50:59,008 --> 00:51:01,802
You'd rather wait for him to die
and then he kills us?

460
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:05,181
Yes. No. You can't kill him.
He's got a daughter!

461
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:07,350
I'm sorry.

462
00:51:08,142 --> 00:51:10,311
There's no other choice.

463
00:51:12,938 --> 00:51:14,940
He's right.

464
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:19,111
Michael, no. What if I'm wrong?

465
00:51:19,153 --> 00:51:21,489
You've seen it happen before.

466
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:27,161
Frank.

467
00:51:27,203 --> 00:51:29,246
Michael's coming to shoot you.

468
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:33,584
- What?
- You're infected.

469
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:36,462
You're going to become one of them.

470
00:51:37,713 --> 00:51:40,299
Is this true?

471
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:42,927
Are you here to kill me?

472
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:46,931
- You were bitten. It's only a matter of time.
- No. No. No.

473
00:51:46,972 --> 00:51:50,935
Leave my dad alone. Go away.
You can't do this.

474
00:51:52,603 --> 00:51:56,190
You have to understand
that she's lost everyone.

475
00:51:57,233 --> 00:52:00,361
Her mother, her two brothers.

476
00:52:02,405 --> 00:52:04,699
I'm all she's got.

477
00:52:07,868 --> 00:52:11,080
Well, Michael, what are you waiting for?

478
00:52:11,122 --> 00:52:14,041
- Go ahead. Kill him.

479
00:52:15,376 --> 00:52:19,213
- Hey, kill Tucker, too.
- Wait a minute. I was never bit.

480
00:52:19,255 --> 00:52:22,133
We can't be sure. Do it, Michael.

481
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:27,013
Are you sure it's the bite?

482
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:29,515
No.

483
00:52:29,598 --> 00:52:32,018
She's sure.

484
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:38,941
I'm sorry.

485
00:53:06,427 --> 00:53:09,180
- Hey.
- Hi.

486
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:11,599
- Are you OK?
- Mm.

487
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,893
Let me see your arm.

488
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:15,686
It hurts.

489
00:53:15,728 --> 00:53:17,938
It's already starting to heal.

490
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,941
Andre, I can't have baby here.

491
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:24,779
Why not? People have had babies
for millions of years,

492
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,615
all on their own, no hospitals.

493
00:53:27,656 --> 00:53:30,618
- Wait.
- Oh, yeah.

494
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:32,787
- It's moving.
- I felt it.

495
00:53:32,828 --> 00:53:35,247
We gotta come up with a name.

496
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:38,626
- I want Russian name.
- Don't start that. African name.

497
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:42,254
- Please?
- Come here and give me a hug.

498
00:53:48,552 --> 00:53:50,805
Sweetie.

499
00:53:51,847 --> 00:53:54,225
I'm so proud.

500
00:53:58,187 --> 00:54:01,482
I couldn't ask for anything more in a daughter.

501
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:13,202
I love you.

502
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:17,707
I love you too.

503
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:26,507
- Time to go, honey.
- No.

504
00:55:11,135 --> 00:55:13,596
Terry, come on. Open the door.

505
00:55:13,637 --> 00:55:18,392
- Shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up. Open the door.

506
00:55:18,434 --> 00:55:20,770
I got you this job. Come on.

507
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,455
You want...

508
00:55:41,415 --> 00:55:43,167
every...

509
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:48,047
single second.

510
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:17,284
Ana.

511
00:56:19,578 --> 00:56:22,123
I'm glad you didn't do it.

512
00:58:04,684 --> 00:58:08,062
- Fuck me harder.

513
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:31,377
OK, here's a good one. Top ten ingredients
to a successful relationship.

514
00:58:33,546 --> 00:58:35,548
I'm gonna skip to the top three.

515
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:38,968
Number three. "He listens to me."

516
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,179
Number two. "He tells me he loves me."

517
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:44,473
And number one.

518
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:49,562
It's trust. Number one is trust.

519
00:58:54,942 --> 00:58:57,236
Holy shit.

520
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,781
He got him.

521
00:59:05,661 --> 00:59:08,706
- So, who do we have next?
- Er...

522
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:14,295
Yeah. Burt Reynolds.

523
00:59:14,336 --> 00:59:16,922
Tell him to get Burt Reynolds.

524
00:59:33,647 --> 00:59:36,817
My goodness.
- Man, he's good.

525
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:39,487
It barely even looked like him.

526
00:59:39,528 --> 00:59:42,281
Oh, oh... er...

527
00:59:42,323 --> 00:59:45,618
- Rosie O'Donnell. Tell him Rosie.
- Yeah, Rosie.

528
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:48,454
Nah, too easy. Give him something hard.

529
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:51,957
You guys had rough childhoods?
A little bit rocky?

530
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:56,837
Hey, sweetheart, let me tell you something.

531
00:59:56,879 --> 01:00:01,133
You have my permission -
if I ever turn into one of those things,

532
01:00:01,175 --> 01:00:03,344
blow my fucking head off.

533
01:00:03,386 --> 01:00:06,013
Oh, yeah, you can count on that.

534
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:16,023
I guess the first time
I knew I was gay I was 13.

535
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:20,152
This guy,

536
01:00:20,194 --> 01:00:22,154
Todd,

537
01:00:23,698 --> 01:00:26,033
he was building a deck in our backyard...

538
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:29,203
OK! Just, please, stop.

539
01:00:33,249 --> 01:00:35,543
He had the most astonishing blue eyes.

540
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:38,170
Oh, my God! I'm in hell.

541
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:48,139
How's Luda doing?

542
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:52,184
She's fine. Hey, where's that lemon stuff?

543
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:55,646
It's all gone. Steve likes to put it in his booze.

544
01:00:57,398 --> 01:00:59,400
Try the vanilla stuff.

545
01:00:59,442 --> 01:01:01,485
All right.

546
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:04,822
I'd like to check on her, see how she's doing.

547
01:01:04,864 --> 01:01:06,365
No, thanks. She's fine.

548
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:10,036
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

549
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:12,413
It's OK, hon. We understand.

550
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:20,796
Thanks.

551
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:40,483
And before that, I worked in a stationery store.

552
01:01:40,524 --> 01:01:44,570
And I drove a snowplow. Fixed copiers.

553
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:49,033
It's a shame this whole
end-of-the-world thing's holding you back.

554
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,790
OK, worst job.

555
01:02:00,294 --> 01:02:04,882
I know which job I was the worst at -
it was being a husband.

556
01:02:04,924 --> 01:02:07,802
- That's not a job.
- It sure is.

557
01:02:08,678 --> 01:02:11,681
You guys just haven't met the right girl.

558
01:02:11,722 --> 01:02:14,433
I tried it three times and...

559
01:02:14,475 --> 01:02:17,103
I got pink slips every time.

560
01:02:17,978 --> 01:02:20,064
What were you best at?

561
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:27,655
Being a dad.

562
01:02:29,907 --> 01:02:31,951
I think I was best at that.

563
01:02:41,669 --> 01:02:43,129
Calm down.

564
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,756
Are they in?
No. Are there generators?

565
01:02:51,262 --> 01:02:54,765
- Shh. OK, shh.

566
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:58,269
Shhh... It's all right, baby.

567
01:03:14,243 --> 01:03:16,829
Baby, please. You got to be quiet, OK?

568
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:23,461
It's gonna be all right.
Our baby is on the way. It's coming.

569
01:03:25,755 --> 01:03:27,965
That's it.

570
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:33,763
It's in employee parking level 3.
They're in a pen near the parking shuttles.

571
01:03:33,804 --> 01:03:37,224
- Have fun.
- Wait a minute. You're coming too.

572
01:03:37,266 --> 01:03:41,854
No, I'm not. I said I'd tell you
where the generators are, not show you.

573
01:03:41,896 --> 01:03:46,567
Did you think I'd just leave you two up here?
You come with me or go back in the cell.

574
01:03:52,406 --> 01:03:54,575
All right.

575
01:03:54,617 --> 01:03:57,495
I ain't going anywhere without a gun.

576
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:02,541
- You're not getting a gun.
- Trust.

577
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,378
The primary ingredient in any relationship.

578
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:11,509
Have at 'em, cowboy.

579
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:15,054
Asshole.

580
01:04:17,181 --> 01:04:19,225
Bart, get the chains.

581
01:04:29,694 --> 01:04:33,072
- You ready to roll?
- You're coming with us?

582
01:04:33,114 --> 01:04:35,366
No, you're coming with me.

583
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:37,535
I've done this before.

584
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,122
Know how to use that?

585
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:45,042
This one's the dangerous end, right?

586
01:04:46,877 --> 01:04:49,630
- Now it is.

587
01:05:14,321 --> 01:05:17,199
This is level 1. We gotta walk down to 3.

588
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,298
What the fuck was that? I just saw something.

589
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,592
You didn't see shit. Shut the fuck up.

590
01:06:28,896 --> 01:06:30,648
Oh, shit. Here it comes.

591
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:40,700
Jesus Christ.

592
01:06:41,742 --> 01:06:44,370
It's a fucking dog.

593
01:06:44,412 --> 01:06:47,206
- Come here, boy.

594
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:52,044
Nothing's here or it would've eaten him.

595
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:55,214
- See? I told you I saw something.

596
01:06:55,256 --> 01:06:58,718
- What's wrong, boy?
- There's nothing wrong.

597
01:06:58,759 --> 01:07:01,137
That dog's just fucked up.

598
01:07:16,068 --> 01:07:18,070
Run!

599
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:23,409
Wait, CJ! Wait up! Wait!

600
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:26,662
It's locked! It's fucking locked!

601
01:07:34,003 --> 01:07:36,422
Come on, let's go!

602
01:07:46,515 --> 01:07:48,309
CJ!

603
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:06,327
I'm out!

604
01:08:15,419 --> 01:08:17,338
CJ! Matches!

605
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:53,791
Breathe. You're doing good. Breathe.

606
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,752
- You're doing good, baby.

607
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:29,076
I'm sorry.

608
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:34,749
I'm sorry.

609
01:10:55,413 --> 01:10:57,873
- Thanks.
- OK. That's the last.

610
01:10:57,915 --> 01:10:59,959
I'm gonna go check on Luda.

611
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,669
- I'll go.
- You sure?

612
01:11:01,711 --> 01:11:04,380
- Yeah. I'll take them some candles.
- OK.

613
01:11:04,422 --> 01:11:07,967
- Let me know if they need anything.
- I'll have a smoke on the way.

614
01:11:08,009 --> 01:11:10,261
- See you.
- Bye.

615
01:11:13,055 --> 01:11:14,849
It's coming.

616
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,647
I see it.

617
01:11:56,974 --> 01:11:59,685
Guys?

618
01:12:12,073 --> 01:12:14,200
Oh, my God.

619
01:12:19,413 --> 01:12:21,999
It's a girl.

620
01:12:27,213 --> 01:12:29,173
Oh...

621
01:12:36,722 --> 01:12:38,808
You want to kill Luda?

622
01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:43,813
You want to kill my family?

623
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:38,117
Norma! Come on, Norma.

624
01:13:39,618 --> 01:13:41,620
What happened?

625
01:13:41,662 --> 01:13:44,540
The son of a bitch shot me.

626
01:13:50,546 --> 01:13:53,632
- Get away from her.
- Wait. Just wait.

627
01:13:56,552 --> 01:13:58,346
She died of the gunshot.

628
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,807
She wasn't bitten.

629
01:14:02,475 --> 01:14:04,685
But she'll wake up, right?

630
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:09,857
No.

631
01:14:09,857 --> 01:14:12,777
No, if she was one of them,
she'd be up by now.

632
01:14:44,266 --> 01:14:46,727
- Terry?
- Yeah.

633
01:14:46,727 --> 01:14:49,522
Hold this.

634
01:14:56,779 --> 01:14:58,989
Oh, God.

635
01:15:26,058 --> 01:15:29,020
- Somebody should say something.
- Yeah.

636
01:15:29,061 --> 01:15:30,896
Glen?

637
01:15:30,938 --> 01:15:33,107
No.

638
01:15:33,149 --> 01:15:35,735
You worked in the church.

639
01:15:36,902 --> 01:15:38,404
I played the organ.

640
01:15:38,446 --> 01:15:43,200
You must have heard the priest say
something about life and death.

641
01:15:43,242 --> 01:15:46,328
It was a job. I don't believe in God.

642
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:50,124
I don't see how anyone could.

643
01:15:51,959 --> 01:15:54,170
Somebody should say something.

644
01:15:56,881 --> 01:15:59,592
There's nothing to say.

645
01:16:00,718 --> 01:16:02,762
I've been to a lot of funerals.

646
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:09,310
I've folded the flag and given it
to a lot of wives and fathers and kids

647
01:16:09,352 --> 01:16:11,479
and told them how sorry I was.

648
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:15,691
But that's not what I was really feeling.

649
01:16:15,733 --> 01:16:20,363
In the back of my mind,
I was always saying, "Better them than me."

650
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:24,950
But I don't believe that now.

651
01:16:24,992 --> 01:16:28,746
Now I realize there are some things
worse than death

652
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:32,041
and one of them is sitting here waiting to die.

653
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:38,255
I don't want to die here.

654
01:16:45,012 --> 01:16:47,640
I saw a couple of buses in the garage.

655
01:16:47,682 --> 01:16:51,185
We could reinforce them,
then get as far from here as possible.

656
01:16:51,227 --> 01:16:55,314
- And then what?
- I have an idea. Um...

657
01:16:55,356 --> 01:16:58,234
Why don't we swing by the marina

658
01:16:58,275 --> 01:17:03,197
and hop in my boat and take it
for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses.

659
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:08,536
Wait. There's islands in the lakes,
there's not a lot of people on them.

660
01:17:08,577 --> 01:17:10,538
I was kidding.

661
01:17:10,579 --> 01:17:13,249
- How far is the marina?
- Oh, my God!

662
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:17,878
- You're serious?
- I think it's a damn good idea.

663
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,674
How about the rest of you?

664
01:17:21,716 --> 01:17:24,885
- Kenneth?
- Yeah, it's a good idea.

665
01:17:24,927 --> 01:17:28,305
We have to pick up Andy.
He's part of the group.

666
01:17:28,347 --> 01:17:33,686
Excuse me. Not to shit on anyone's riff
but let me see if I grasp this concept.

667
01:17:33,728 --> 01:17:38,691
You're saying we take the parking shuttles,
reinforce them with aluminum siding

668
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:40,651
and then head to the gun store

669
01:17:40,693 --> 01:17:45,072
where our friend Andy plays some
cowboy-movie, jump-on-the-wagon bullshit.

670
01:17:45,072 --> 01:17:49,535
Then we drive across a ruined city
through thousands of dead cannibals,

671
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:53,831
all so we can sail off into the sunset
on this fucking asshole's boat?

672
01:17:53,873 --> 01:17:57,376
And head for some island
which may not even exist?

673
01:17:58,419 --> 01:18:03,007
- Yeah.
- Pretty much, yeah.

674
01:18:06,427 --> 01:18:08,679
Yeah.

675
01:18:09,764 --> 01:18:12,308
OK.

676
01:18:13,768 --> 01:18:15,186
I'm in.

677
01:19:22,503 --> 01:19:27,967
We have 12 of these shotgun shells,
26 of those pussy.9- Mils,

678
01:19:28,009 --> 01:19:30,845
and 16 of the.357 Magnums.

679
01:19:30,845 --> 01:19:33,055
Yeah? That's still not very much,

680
01:19:33,097 --> 01:19:37,935
so hopefully there won't be
too many of them at the dock.

681
01:19:37,977 --> 01:19:40,187
Nice to see you busting your ass.

682
01:19:40,187 --> 01:19:43,816
Oh, that's sarcasm. That is awesome.

683
01:19:43,858 --> 01:19:47,445
You know, I would love to help but, er,

684
01:19:47,486 --> 01:19:50,656
a captain never works alongside his men.

685
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:54,952
You guys have a good 'un.

686
01:19:54,994 --> 01:19:57,830
What a total dick.

687
01:19:57,872 --> 01:20:00,499
Guys, where did Chips go?

688
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:04,879
- Chips?
- I can't find him. Chips? Come on, Chips!

689
01:20:04,879 --> 01:20:08,466
"Come on, Chips!"
- Where'd you go, honey?

690
01:20:11,677 --> 01:20:15,306
There you are. There's my boy.

691
01:20:15,348 --> 01:20:18,225
Don't you ever leave me again, OK?
Ever, ever.

692
01:20:45,753 --> 01:20:48,381
Hey. Kenneth wants a meeting upstairs.

693
01:20:48,422 --> 01:20:51,384
Come in here first. I want you to see this.

694
01:20:56,013 --> 01:21:00,059
When those things are on
the side of the bus, this'll get them off.

695
01:21:01,102 --> 01:21:03,062
Cool, huh?

696
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:06,107
Wow.

697
01:21:06,148 --> 01:21:10,403
That might be the most romantic thing
anyone's ever shown me.

698
01:21:14,156 --> 01:21:16,117
I'm trying here.

699
01:21:17,451 --> 01:21:19,537
Yeah, I know.

700
01:21:34,844 --> 01:21:36,929
It's not just about him starving.

701
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:41,684
If we pick him up and he doesn't have
his strength, we'll be carrying him.

702
01:21:41,726 --> 01:21:44,729
She's right. He's a hell of a shot. We need him.

703
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:48,315
- I'm not saying we don't.
- There's no point in arguing.

704
01:21:48,357 --> 01:21:51,193
We need to get some food over there.

705
01:21:51,235 --> 01:21:55,906
I know. We draw straws and the loser runs
across the lot with a ham sandwich.

706
01:21:55,948 --> 01:21:59,535
- Could you be a bigger prick?
- Yes, but that's irrelevant.

707
01:21:59,577 --> 01:22:01,996
My question is, what's your plan?

708
01:22:01,996 --> 01:22:04,623
- Come on!

709
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:09,045
- I got it.

710
01:22:09,086 --> 01:22:11,505
- Shut up!
...more ammunition.

711
01:22:13,466 --> 01:22:15,343
I have an idea.

712
01:22:15,384 --> 01:22:19,513
- It's hurting him! It's not safe!
- They're not interested in him.

713
01:22:19,555 --> 01:22:23,642
They want us, OK? Chips is gonna be fine.

714
01:22:32,443 --> 01:22:36,697
See? Look, they're not even
paying attention to him.

715
01:22:39,283 --> 01:22:42,536
The walkie's in the bag?
Yeah.

716
01:22:45,414 --> 01:22:47,958
Let me see. Let me see!

717
01:22:52,463 --> 01:22:54,632
- There he is.

718
01:22:54,674 --> 01:22:56,842
Good boy. Good boy, Chips.

719
01:22:59,136 --> 01:23:02,181
- OK, he's there, he's in.
- Give me those.

720
01:23:04,433 --> 01:23:06,018
Oh, man.

721
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,187
- What? What?
- No.

722
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:11,190
No. Oh, man. They got him. They got him!

723
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:23,202
I'll try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?

724
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:26,622
Andy, can you hear me?

725
01:23:27,748 --> 01:23:30,251
Andy?

726
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:33,838
'Can you hear me? Hello?
This thing working?

727
01:23:33,879 --> 01:23:37,091
'I'm dinged up pretty bad but I think I'll be OK.'

728
01:23:38,217 --> 01:23:41,721
- Where are you hurt?
- 'Goddamn, those bastards bite hard.

729
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:47,435
'I just have to stop the bleeding.
It's really going.'

730
01:23:47,435 --> 01:23:51,814
- 'Easy, boy. Easy. Is this Ken?

731
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:53,941
'Is that you, man? '

732
01:23:55,401 --> 01:23:59,238
- Yeah, it's me, brother.
- 'Hey, man, good to hear your voice.

733
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,741
'I guess we'll meet up-close pretty soon.

734
01:24:01,782 --> 01:24:04,618
'Shit, hang on.

735
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,121
'Ah, Jesus. He got me good.'

736
01:24:07,163 --> 01:24:10,583
You just hang in there. You got the food, right?

737
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,710
- 'Yeah.'
- Do we tell him?

738
01:24:12,752 --> 01:24:16,255
- 'Hey, this dog got a name? '

739
01:24:18,549 --> 01:24:21,927
- See, Nicole, Chips... Nicole?

740
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:25,222
- What the hell's that?
- Oh, my God, it's Nicole!

741
01:24:30,144 --> 01:24:32,229
Shit.

742
01:24:39,153 --> 01:24:42,448
That idiot's going after the fucking dog.

743
01:24:45,493 --> 01:24:47,578
She made it! She's in!

744
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:53,959
'Guys, I found Chips!
I got him. He's OK! '

745
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:56,087
Nicole, how's Andy looking?

746
01:24:57,171 --> 01:25:01,801
'I don't know. There's a lot of blood in here.
There's blood everywhere.'

747
01:25:01,842 --> 01:25:03,969
Wait, I see him. He's on the roof.

748
01:25:05,179 --> 01:25:08,349
- He's writing something.
- What's it say?

749
01:25:10,059 --> 01:25:11,894
'Guys? '

750
01:25:11,936 --> 01:25:14,605
- Tell her to get out!
- What's wrong?

751
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:18,442
- Nicole, how's the truck?
- 'I'm not going back out there.'

752
01:25:18,484 --> 01:25:21,153
- 'Chips, be quiet! '

753
01:25:21,195 --> 01:25:23,030
Tell her to get the hell out!

754
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:27,952
- You need to hide. Can you do that?
- 'What do you mean? What's going on? '

755
01:25:27,993 --> 01:25:30,454
- Nicole?
- 'Here's Andy.

756
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,498
- 'Oh, my God! '
- Tell her to get out!

757
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,709
Nicole, listen to me.

758
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:38,587
'I'm in a closet
but he's outside trying to get... '

759
01:25:38,629 --> 01:25:40,756
Nicole? Nicole?

760
01:25:40,798 --> 01:25:45,011
'Help me. Please, you have to help me!
I'm gonna die! '

761
01:25:50,182 --> 01:25:53,019
We need to do something. Now.

762
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,862
Tucker, when we come back
we may have company.

763
01:26:02,903 --> 01:26:05,656
Stay here and make sure this door stays open.

764
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:08,659
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Why does he stay here

765
01:26:08,701 --> 01:26:13,414
while I go on the suicide mission
to rescue Terry's already dead girlfriend?

766
01:26:13,414 --> 01:26:15,541
- Fuck you.
- We don't know that.

767
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:19,754
Either way, we need the guns
to get out of this parking lot.

768
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:23,841
- Michael, it's OK. Let him stay.
- Yeah.

769
01:26:23,883 --> 01:26:27,053
- Steve, don't fuck this up.
- Yeah. Totally.

770
01:27:12,056 --> 01:27:16,602
- All right. That's it.
- Are you sure?

771
01:27:16,644 --> 01:27:18,813
I'd say we're at the end of the line.

772
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:09,363
Go! Go!

773
01:28:12,658 --> 01:28:16,287
- Through here!
- Hurry up!

774
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:38,976
- Hurry up, hurry.

775
01:28:53,532 --> 01:28:57,703
.357,.357. What do you need?
.38,.38.

776
01:28:57,745 --> 01:29:00,081
Here.
- Damn it.

777
01:29:00,122 --> 01:29:02,291
Hurry up.

778
01:29:07,338 --> 01:29:09,548
All right.

779
01:29:11,217 --> 01:29:13,260
Oh, shit.

780
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:20,059
Nicole?

781
01:29:47,962 --> 01:29:51,132
- Andy.

782
01:29:51,173 --> 01:29:53,467
I'm sorry, brother.

783
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,977
Nicole, are you in there?
- I'm here, I'm here!

784
01:30:05,938 --> 01:30:08,649
Get as much ammo as you can.

785
01:30:10,735 --> 01:30:14,989
- You got a plan?
- Uh-uh. You?

786
01:30:16,115 --> 01:30:18,242
How about a barbecue?

787
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:38,971
How do we know if he hits it?

788
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:09,293
CJ! Over here, hurry up!

789
01:31:09,335 --> 01:31:11,379
Over here!

790
01:31:12,254 --> 01:31:14,715
Go! Get down! Look out!

791
01:31:18,761 --> 01:31:21,347
Come on, Tucker!

792
01:31:21,389 --> 01:31:24,308
- Shit!

793
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:27,728
- Ah, my leg!
- I got you, Tucker.

794
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:32,650
- Go! Go!

795
01:31:32,692 --> 01:31:34,026
Shit!

796
01:31:36,904 --> 01:31:39,115
Go!

797
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:42,368
Go!

798
01:32:05,391 --> 01:32:08,352
Shoot me! Shoot me!

799
01:32:10,938 --> 01:32:13,774
Hurry! Come on!

800
01:32:13,774 --> 01:32:16,110
Hurry, hurry!

801
01:32:17,486 --> 01:32:19,613
Goddamn Steve Markus!

802
01:32:21,782 --> 01:32:24,243
- Steve, come on!
- Open up!

803
01:32:24,285 --> 01:32:28,247
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Steve!

804
01:32:28,289 --> 01:32:31,250
- I'll fucking kill him!
- Open the door.

805
01:32:31,292 --> 01:32:34,503
- Steve!

806
01:32:44,764 --> 01:32:46,474
Let's go.

807
01:32:52,813 --> 01:32:55,483
Goddamnit!

808
01:32:56,442 --> 01:32:58,569
Move!

809
01:33:04,658 --> 01:33:07,828
- Go!
- Move it, guys, move it!

810
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:10,456
- Where are you going?
- Just go right now!

811
01:33:10,498 --> 01:33:12,083
Go! Go!

812
01:33:12,124 --> 01:33:14,460
- They're right behind us!
- Go!

813
01:33:17,672 --> 01:33:20,591
Come on, move! They're right behind us!

814
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:24,637
Get in!

815
01:33:24,679 --> 01:33:27,056
Close the door!

816
01:33:37,858 --> 01:33:39,985
I like this song.

817
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:48,911
- Everybody in!
- What the hell happened to you guys?

818
01:33:48,953 --> 01:33:52,790
- Prick.
- I'll deal with you later, motherfucker!

819
01:33:52,832 --> 01:33:56,460
- Wait a minute! Nicole!
- Get in!

820
01:33:58,671 --> 01:34:01,382
I'll take the gun. OK.

821
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,635
OK, let's get out of here!

822
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:25,197
Hold on!

823
01:34:38,836 --> 01:34:40,838
Oh, Christ!

824
01:34:46,469 --> 01:34:48,888
CJ, now! Go!

825
01:35:05,446 --> 01:35:09,033
They're trying to turn us over!
Hit 'em with the saw!

826
01:35:34,767 --> 01:35:36,936
Give me a shotgun!

827
01:36:05,131 --> 01:36:07,425
Holy shit.

828
01:36:45,713 --> 01:36:48,549
There's still one hanging on.

829
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:51,552
- Which fucking side?
- Right side!

830
01:36:54,055 --> 01:36:57,183
- I got him.
- You gotta drive faster, man.

831
01:36:58,601 --> 01:37:01,187
Hard left here!

832
01:37:18,954 --> 01:37:21,540
Whoa, stop! Stop, guys.

833
01:37:21,582 --> 01:37:23,668
- What?
- We lost them.

834
01:37:23,709 --> 01:37:25,878
- Back it up!

835
01:37:31,425 --> 01:37:33,094
Kenneth, are you there?

836
01:37:38,099 --> 01:37:40,226
'Kenneth, are you there?

837
01:37:47,483 --> 01:37:49,568
'Kenneth, are you OK? '

838
01:38:11,507 --> 01:38:13,300
What the fuck?

839
01:38:18,681 --> 01:38:22,476
- What are you doing?
- Fucking nursery school.

840
01:38:26,689 --> 01:38:28,524
CJ!

841
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:35,322
Ana, no! Everyone's dead.

842
01:38:35,364 --> 01:38:38,451
- Steve took off.
- What?

843
01:38:39,368 --> 01:38:41,454
Let's go! Come on!

844
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,585
Steve!

845
01:38:47,626 --> 01:38:49,837
- I got him.

846
01:38:53,382 --> 01:38:54,759
Damn.

847
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,845
Look out!

848
01:38:58,471 --> 01:39:00,097
Come on, come on!

849
01:39:02,391 --> 01:39:04,643
Go, go, go!

850
01:39:04,685 --> 01:39:08,647
- Open the door! Hurry up!
- Come on!

851
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:11,859
Guys, get in!

852
01:39:18,699 --> 01:39:20,701
Let's go.

853
01:39:20,743 --> 01:39:22,953
Where's Ana? Ana!

854
01:39:25,247 --> 01:39:27,041
Ana!

855
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:30,544
Get in.

856
01:39:41,889 --> 01:39:44,725
What the hell were you doing?

857
01:40:21,762 --> 01:40:23,723
Hold on!

858
01:40:53,627 --> 01:40:55,963
Come on, boy.

859
01:40:57,465 --> 01:41:01,302
Kenneth. Here. Get out on the end of the dock.

860
01:41:01,969 --> 01:41:04,555
- CJ, come on.
- Do it! I'll catch up.

861
01:41:08,142 --> 01:41:10,644
- There it is!
- Terry, get the bowline!

862
01:41:11,979 --> 01:41:14,815
- Shit.

863
01:41:17,693 --> 01:41:19,528
CJ!

864
01:41:21,572 --> 01:41:23,783
Damn! Fuck!

865
01:41:24,825 --> 01:41:27,411
Come on!

866
01:41:34,377 --> 01:41:36,629
Come on!

867
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:39,840
Bitch! Shit.

868
01:41:49,183 --> 01:41:51,185
Come on.

869
01:41:55,731 --> 01:41:59,026
I'll blow every fucking thing up.

870
01:42:28,764 --> 01:42:31,225
OK, let's go, let's go.

871
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:33,853
- I can't go.
- What?

872
01:42:35,479 --> 01:42:39,984
- Downtown when they jumped on us.
- Oh, no, Michael. No.

873
01:42:40,026 --> 01:42:43,988
- I have to stay here.
- You can't. No, you...

874
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:46,782
- I'm sorry, Ana.
- I can help you.

875
01:42:46,824 --> 01:42:50,369
No, you can't. You can help them.

876
01:42:51,203 --> 01:42:53,539
Stay on the boat.

877
01:42:58,085 --> 01:43:00,004
I can help you.

878
01:43:00,046 --> 01:43:03,215
It's OK. It's gonna be all right.

879
01:43:03,257 --> 01:43:05,384
No.

880
01:43:07,011 --> 01:43:10,931
- It won't.
- Hey.

881
01:43:10,931 --> 01:43:13,642
It will.

882
01:43:27,823 --> 01:43:30,117
You sure you wanna do this?

883
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:33,829
Yeah. I think I'll just stay here a while.

884
01:43:33,871 --> 01:43:36,082
Enjoy the sunrise.

885
01:45:07,423 --> 01:45:09,467
'I run a tight ship.'

886
01:45:11,218 --> 01:45:15,181
- 'Where did you get that? '
'I found Steve's camera.'

887
01:45:48,756 --> 01:45:51,133
'Put that down and help us.'

888
01:45:53,928 --> 01:45:57,181
'Ah! Kenneth, fucking shoot it! '

889
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:12,613
'Christ! '

890
01:46:20,913 --> 01:46:23,124
'Oh, shit! '

891
01:46:26,252 --> 01:46:28,421
'Get your damn camera out my face.'

892
01:46:37,596 --> 01:46:40,599
- '... if there's anyone there.'

893
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,353
'Terry, put the camera down
and help us off the boat.'

894
01:46:52,153 --> 01:46:55,156
'Nicole, what is it? '

895
01:46:55,197 --> 01:46:58,409
'Chips, no! '

896
01:47:10,755 --> 01:47:13,007
'Oh, shit! '

897
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,346
'Stay behind me.'
