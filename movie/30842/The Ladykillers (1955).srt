When She Came To Report It,

I Thought It No More Than My
Duty To Come Here And Explain.

Mrs. Wilberforce, I Don't
Think You Quite Understand...

00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,700
The Intricacies Of This
Particular Situation.

642
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,100
Let Me Try To Explain, Mrs. Wilberforce.

643
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,940
You See, In This Case, It Would
Do No Good To Take The Money Back.

644
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,780
Strange As It May Seem To You,
Nobody Wants The Money Back.

00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,660
Don't Expect Me To Believe That.

646
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,540
But It's True, Mrs. Wilberforce.

647
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,140
You See, This Particular
Shipment Of Money Was Insured.

648
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,940
So Now The Insurance Company Simply
Pays To The Factory 60,000 Pounds,

649
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,820
And Then, In Order To Recover Its Money,

650
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:15,100
It Puts One Farthing On All The
Premiums, On All The Policies...

00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,340
So How Much Real Harm
Have We Done Anybody?

You Hadn't Thought Of
It Like That, Had You?

Hey, You Know What? I Never
Thought Of It Like That Either.

Surely It Isn't As Simple As All That.

I Assure You, If We Tried
To Take The Money Back Now,

659
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,220
It Would Simply Confuse The Whole Issue.

Back. That's Perfectly True.
