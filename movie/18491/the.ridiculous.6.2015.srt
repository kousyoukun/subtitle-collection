1
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,950
看这里。
Lookie here.

2
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,660
我的一天。
My day is made.

3
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,710
我甚至不吃早餐，我去杀了我一个讨厌的印第安。
I didn't even finish breakfast and I get to kill me a stinkin' Injun.

4
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,130
印第安？
Injun?

5
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,630
Nah。
Nah.

6
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,340
我只穿这样的我不要让黄牛在草原。
I just dress like this so's I don't get scalped out on the prairie.

7
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,470
哦，那是一个令人信服的装备。
Oh, well, that's a convincing outfit.

8
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,930
是的，你不能太安全了…
Yeah, you can't be too safe out there...

9
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,560
这些野蛮人在周围。
with all of them savages runnin' around.

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,440
那么，我能为你做什么？
So, what can I do you for?

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,730
需要面粉。五袋。
Need some flour. Five sacks.

12
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,070
一根胡萝卜加上花生酱。
And a carrot with peanut butter on it.

13
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,650
现在，什么让我跑？
Now, what's that gonna run me?

14
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,660
好了，一袋45美分。
Well, sack of flour's 45 cents.

15
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,990
所以，五个麻袋…
So, five sacks...

16
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,040
是40…
is 40...

17
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,830
想要回到我吗？
Wanna get back to me on that?

18
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,870
是的，看…
Yeah, look...

19
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,580
现在，面粉的地下室。
Now, the flour's in the basement.

20
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,880
你可以自己去拿。
You can fetch it yourself.

21
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,000
非常感谢。
Much obliged.

22
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,980
好吧，看看我们在这里得到了什么。
Well, lookie what we got here.

23
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,320
甜的一片红色的草原肉出来所有的她寂寞。
Sweet piece of red prairie meat out all by her lonesome.

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,030
你做的这个，说什么？哦，我想她在等你，会。
- What do you make of that, Nelly? - Oh, I think she's waiting on you, Will.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,620
-继续，得到它。现在就在现在。
- Go on, get on it. - It's on now.

26
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,000
-是的。-去得到她，将。
- Yeah. - Go get her, Will.

27
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
哦，哦，哦。
Oh, oh, oh.

28
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,420
我们在这里走。
Here we go.

29
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,760
现在，你必须知道，为什么五个男子完美的下巴…
Now, you must be wondering why five badass <i>hombres</i> with perfect jawlines...

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,970
所有的运动一样时尚的眼睛补丁。
all sport the same stylish eye patch.

31
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,020
不是我的事。
Not my business.

32
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,560
我们都把我们的眼球雕刻出来
We all carved our eyeballs out our skull

33
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,110
为了表示我们对这帮人的投入。
to show how devoted we are to this gang.

34
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,440
我们的左眼男孩！
We the Left-Eye Boys!

35
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,070
是啊
Yeah!

36
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,740
嘿！
Hey!

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,620
你真漂亮的眼睛，小姐。
You got real pretty eyes, miss.

38
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,830
你认为我们可以，我不知道，借一个？
You reckon we can, I don't know, borrow one?

39
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,920
我们可以借一个吗？
Can we borrow one?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,760
现在，是一个适当的问题，问一位女士吗？
Now, is that a proper question to ask a lady?

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,880
你是谁？男朋友？
Who are you, slick? The boyfriend?

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,180
很快成为丈夫。
Soon to be the husband.

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,520
哦，等一下！那是在那一个白人男孩。
Oh, wait a minute! That's a white boy under that getup.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,400
那是一个白人男孩？哦，该死。
That's a white boy? Oh, shit.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,690
你偏苍白的面孔，POCA热奶吗？
You partial to pale faces, Poca-hot-tits?

46
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,780
哈？
Huh?

47
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,320
因为我可以告诉你什么是真正的白人男子的。
'Cause I can show you what a real white man's like.

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,780
-是的，展示她，将。是的，继续。-是的，洗牌。
- Yeah, show her, Will. Yeah, go on. - Yeah, shuffle up, Will.

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,280
跳舞吧，男孩。-重新洗牌。
- Dance now, boy. - Shuffle on over.

50
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,040
?你走了。?这是一些白人男孩在那里。
- There you go. - That's some white boy shit right there.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,870
现在，我想把我的眼睛挖出来。
Now, I do want to carve my eyes out.

52
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,500
-你说什么？嘿，家伙…
- What'd you say? - Hey, fellers...

53
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,540
在你受伤之前，我会撞到你的踪迹。
I'd hit the trail before you get hurt.

54
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,420
在我们受伤之前？
Before we get hurt?

55
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,090
在我们受伤之前。
Before we get hurt.

56
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,130
我想你有吸烟太多的和平烟斗，科默粗俗。
I think you've been smokin' too much of that peace pipe, kemo-slobby.

57
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,680
现在，从我所看到的，有一个你，
Now, from what I see, there's one of you,

58
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,100
还有我们五个。
and there's five of us.

59
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
四的你。
Four of you.

60
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,770
发生了什么事？
What just happened?

61
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,150
你想再看一次吗？
You wanna see it again?

62
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,990
嗯…可以
Uh... yes.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,380
?我不喜欢这个大便。-闭嘴。
- I don't like this shit. - Shut up.

64
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,590
嗯，那是一些，嗯…真正的花式步法。
Well, that's some, uh... real fancy footwork.

65
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,430
但我想这喧嚣已经升级到枪械舞台。
But I think this hullabaloo has escalated to the firearms stage.

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,770
孩子们，让我们呼吸这。
Boys, let's ventilate this.

67
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,550
发生了什么事？
What the shit that just happened?

68
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,350
什么地狱？什么在地狱？
What the hell? What in the hell?

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,940
“撞到了小路”，很简单。
"Hit the trail." It was so simple.

70
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,480
你必须停止这样做，白刀。有一天，会有太多的。
You must stop doing this, White Knife. One day, there will be too many.

71
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,700
但不是今天，吸烟狐狸。
But not today, Smoking Fox.

72
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,700
请，我的爱…我们必须去。
Please, my love... we must go.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,490
这到底发生了什么？
What the hell happened out here?

74
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,790
印第安人。他们走到了那个方向。
Injuns. They went that way.

75
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,500
你不是没有白人男子。
You ain't no white man.

76
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,790
你是那个孤儿，白刀。
You're that orphan, White Knife.

77
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,500
在与阿帕奇直升机的动物。
Raised like an animal with those Apaches.

78
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,670
你认为你可以愚弄老克莱姆？
You think you can fool ol' Clem?

79
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
对不起，戈。
Sorry, Ringo.

80
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,930
好了，现在我要杀了你，你的印第安婊子。
Well, now I'm gonna shoot you and your Injun whore.

81
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,180
必须削减早餐短。
Gotta cut breakfast short.

82
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,640
你吸，先生！
You suck, mister!

83
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
你吮吸！
You suck!

84
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,320
你是什么？
What are you?

85
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,510
是的，白刀。
Yes, White Knife.

86
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,840
去，白刀。
Go, White Knife.

87
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,270
耶！
Yay!

88
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,980
你幸运的，吸烟的狐狸。
You lucky, Smoking Fox.

89
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,150
白刀所有人。最勇敢的勇士。
White Knife all man. Bravest of all braves.

90
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,570
不勇敢。愚蠢的。
Not brave. Foolish.

91
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,030
我想做妻子，而不是寡妇。
I want to be wife, not widow.

92
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,160
下午，女士们。
Afternoon, ladies.

93
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,920
这是Apache的土地。
This is Apache land.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,710
我不是来拿你的土地，酋长。
I'm not here to take your land, Chief.

95
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,710
我只是在找一个特别的男孩。
I'm just looking for a particular boy.

96
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,590
我是弗兰克stockburn。
I'm Frank Stockburn.

97
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,390
这个男孩的母亲是我的妻子。
This boy's mother was my wife.

98
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,350
和男孩，汤米…
And the boy, Tommy...

99
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,930
他是我的儿子。
he's my son.

100
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,240
慢慢地相信，白刀是明智的。
It is wise to be slow to trust, White Knife.

101
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,660
但每一个新的旅程都始于一个单一的步骤。
But every new journey begins with a single step.

102
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,500
和你的父亲说话。
Speak with your father.

103
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,670
但你是我的父亲，尖叫鹰。
But you are my father, Screaming Eagle.

104
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,050
自从我母亲…
Ever since my mother...

105
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,090
自从你找到我…
Ever since you found me...

106
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,430
你教我去打猎，去战斗…
you taught me to hunt, to fight...

107
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,640
什么时候说话，什么时候沉默。
when to speak and when to be silent.

108
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,930
做一个男人。一个好男人。
- To be a man. - A good man.

109
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,640
这stockburn弗兰克，
And this Frank Stockburn,

110
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,190
他充满谎言，就像其他的白人。
he is filled with lies, just like every other white man.

111
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,980
有时，白人讲真话。
Sometimes, the white man speaks the truth.

112
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,780
喜欢，一个在20个，25次。
Like, one in 20, 25 times.

113
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,570
我相信这是一个时代。
I believe this is one of those times.

114
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,080
他认识你的母亲，白刀。
He knew your mother, White Knife.

115
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,040
也许他能给你一些和平。和他说话。
Maybe he can give you some peace. Talk to him.

116
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,710
也许在我闭上眼睛去做梦。
Maybe after I close my eyes to dream.

117
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,650
妈妈！
Mommy!

118
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,220
哦，不
Oh, no.

119
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,270
一看我，你知道你的老男人做了很多坏事，不是吗？
One look at me, and you knew your old man had done a lot of bad things, didn't ya?

120
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,820
我欺骗了男人，我杀了人…
I cheated men, I killed men...

121
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,240
所以，我应该得到的会给我。
So I deserve whatever's comin' to me.

122
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,910
在我身上看到过的唯一的一个就是你的母亲。
The only one that ever saw any good in me was your mother.

123
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,670
哦
Oh!

124
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,250
你为什么来这儿？
Why have you come here?

125
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,460
没有一个人聊天，对吧？
Not a man for chitchat, huh?

126
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,630
好吧，我也不。
Well, me neither.

127
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,140
孩子，我快要死了…
Kid, I'm dying...

128
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,720
消费。
of consumption.

129
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,520
别担心…
Don't worry...

130
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,730
我不是在寻找什么大儿子呼啊。
I'm not looking for no big father-son hoo-ah.

131
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
“我爱你，儿子。”
"I love you, son."

132
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,110
“我也爱你，爸爸。”
"I love you too, Daddy."

133
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,040
没有
No.

134
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,920
我来了一个更具体的理由。
I've come for a more tangible reason.

135
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,470
汤米，我从九岁开始就一直在偷东西…
Tommy, I've been stealing from folks since I was nine years old...

136
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,680
这是我积累了一个好的小财富的方式。
and that's the way I've amassed a good little fortune.

137
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,400
我想做一些体面的事情。
I wanna do something decent with it.

138
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,320
我想给你，儿子。
I want to give it to you, son.

139
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,570
我不想要你的钱。
I don't want your money.

140
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,240
但也许你能给…
But maybe you could give...

141
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,700
50000美元，这些漂亮的印第安人抚养你。
$50,000 to these nice Injuns who raised you.

142
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,000
我们将把它。
We'll take it.

143
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,250
回到床上。
Go back to bed.

144
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,880
对不起
Sorry.

145
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,750
不过，我们会认真对待。
Seriously, though, we'll take it.

146
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,300
看，它是埋在草地上的线索，
Look, it's buried in the meadow just up the trail,

147
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,470
旁边的一个大的松树。
next to a big ol' pine tree.

148
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,930
你怎么说我们去把它挖掘出来
What do you say we go dig it up in the morning

149
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,010
开始玩圣诞老人克劳斯？
and start playing Santa Claus?

150
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,770
我不记得太多关于我的母亲…
I don't remember much about my mother...

151
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,310
但我记得她告诉我…
but I do remember her telling me...

152
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,730
你死了。
you were dead.

153
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,530
也许是因为…
Maybe it was because...

154
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,950
她不想你来找我。
she didn't want you to come looking for me.

155
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,120
她是个聪明的女人。
She was a smart lady.

156
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,250
她只为我做了一件愚蠢的事情。
Only stupid thing she ever did was fall for me.

157
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
会议贝蒂邓森…
Meeting Betty Dunson...

158
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,760
是我最幸运的事情发生在我。
was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me.

159
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,180
从第一天，我躺在她的眼睛…
From the first day I laid eyes on her...

160
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,100
她bawlin '这…
she was bawlin' out this...

161
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,110
醉了，大的强壮的铁匠…
half-drunk, big ol' burly blacksmith...

162
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,730
在银色峡谷。
down at Silver Canyon.

163
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,900
她是唯一一个，汤米。
She's been the only one, Tommy.

164
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,620
妈妈发脾气了吗？
Mom had a temper?

165
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,670
脾气？当她得到她动肝火，看看。
Temper? When she got her dander up, look out.

166
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,590
我们曾经在一家酒吧里。
We was in a saloon once.

167
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,840
这家伙坐在她旁边
This fellow sitting next to her

168
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,930
开始讲一个完美的方式来做一个樱桃派…
starts talking about the perfect way to make a cherry pie...

169
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,810
所以你妈妈对我说：“坦率的，来这儿一分钟。
So your mom says to me, "Frank, come here a minute.

170
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,650
再告诉我，你是在哪里弄到花的？”
Tell me again, just where did you get them flowers?"

171
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,770
我说，“我知道你认为我从墓地偷了他们。”
I said, "I know that you think I stole them from the graveyard."

172
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,610
早上好，男孩。
Good morning, boys.

173
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,110
早上，从来没有穿胸罩。
Morning, Never Wears Bra.

174
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,030
我昨晚梦见你了，白刀。
I had dream about you last night, White Knife.

175
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,950
哦，太好了。
Oh, that's nice.

176
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,290
不好的梦。
Not nice dream.

177
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,500
在梦里，你淘气。
In dream, you naughty.

178
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,710
你淘气，白刀。
You naughty, White Knife.

179
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,040
嗯，有人崇拜。
Mmm, somebody's got an admirer.

180
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,170
是的，是的。
Yes, yes.

181
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,260
但和你一样，只有一个女人。
But like you, there's only one woman for me.

182
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,430
我想我们stockburns是…
I guess we Stockburns are...

183
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,270
偏甜的。
partial to the sweet ones.

184
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,730
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

185
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,600
像你的母亲。
Like your mother.

186
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,400
汤米，她怎么死的？
How did she die, Tommy?

187
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,780
你告诉我？
You tell me?

188
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,830
嗯，有这些大孩子在学校就要打我。
Well, there were these big kids at school fixin' to beat me up.

189
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,870
我没有面对他们自己，我让她走我那里。
Instead of facing them myself, I had her walk me there.

190
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,960
这家伙出来的地方…
This feller comes out of nowhere...

191
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,670
走到她身边，把她打死。
walks right up to her and shoots her dead.

192
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,720
那她是怎么死的，保护她胆小的儿子
So that's how she died, protecting her gutless son

193
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,890
她不在家，安全的地方。
instead of being home, safe where she belonged.

194
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,190
那是谁？那骨快车吗？
Who's that? Is that Bony Express?

195
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,150
骨表达不来这里。
Bony Express don't come around here.

196
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,740
驾！
Giddyap!

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,170
他在这里的某个地方，男孩。
He's here somewhere, boys.

198
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,460
让我们把他烧了！
Let's burn him out!

199
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,090
哦
Oh...

200
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,090
下一个穿过你的额头。
Next one goes through your forehead.

201
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,930
嘿，嘿！没必要烧什么，男孩！
Hey, hey! No need to burn nothing, boys!

202
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,010
你好，老板。
Howdy, boss.

203
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,220
西塞罗…
Cicero...

204
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,230
你不会让一个人享受他退休的，是吗？
you're not gonna let a man enjoy his retirement, are ya?

205
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,860
不，坦白，我向你决定从你的罪恶的方式转向。
No, Frank, I salute your decision to turn from your sinful ways.

206
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,690
但钱…
But the money...

207
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,490
这属于我们所有人。
that belongs to all of us.

208
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,910
触摸那钢铁，男孩，
Touch that steel, boy,

209
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,160
我把一个在我放了一个在…
I got plenty of bullets left over after I put one in...

210
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
你父亲。
your father.

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,080
哦，你终于找到了你的长长的儿子。
Oh, you finally found your long lost son.

212
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,500
好吧，我真的不喜欢这样的家庭聚会。
Well, I sure hate to break up this nice family reunion.

213
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,880
所以，你为什么不给我们你偷的钱
So, why don't you give us the money you stole

214
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,760
在我把铅放在你的头。
before I put lead in your head.

215
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,060
钱的埋葬。
The money's buried.

216
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,350
儿子的方式来运行你的嘴。
Way to run your mouth, son.

217
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,850
它埋葬了吗？
It's buried?

218
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,690
是的，我埋葬了它。
Yeah, I buried it.

219
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,280
深地…旁边的一个风车。
Deep in the ground... next to a windmill.

220
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,650
西方的风车…
A windmill in the West...

221
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,860
不太窄，坦率。
doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.

222
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,330
哦，这是一个特别的风车。
Well, this is a special windmill.

223
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,120
这是一个唱歌的风车。
It's a singing windmill.

224
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,500
一个唱歌的风车！
A singing windmill!

225
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,800
从这里乘车大约一一零天。
It's about a ten-day ride from here.

226
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,920
我会带你去一个条件。
I'll lead you to it presently on one condition.

227
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,340
你不伤害我的男孩…
You don't hurt my boy...

228
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,850
或任何这些好心的印第安人在这里。
or any of these kindly Injuns here.

229
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,970
让我们骑，坦率。
Let's ride, Frank.

230
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,530
如果50000美元没有在那架风车下，
Frank, if that $50,000 isn't under that windmill,

231
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,320
我要把你埋葬在你的脖子上
I'm gonna bury you up to your neck

232
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,990
让沙漠动物活吃了你。
and let the desert critters eat you alive.

233
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,450
它的存在，西塞罗，它的存在。
It's there, Cicero, it's there.

234
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,250
我很高兴见到贝蒂邓森的儿子。
I'm glad I got to meet Betty Dunson's son.

235
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,420
你只是停留在这里，汤米。
You just stay here, Tommy.

236
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,840
享受你的生活与你美丽的新娘…
Enjoy your life with your beautiful bride...

237
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,970
在这些雄伟的松树。
amongst these majestic pine trees.

238
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,310
走吧
Let's go!

239
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,700
嗯，那是酷。
Well, that was uncool.

240
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,180
白刀，你要休息。
White Knife, you must rest.

241
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,720
我怎么休息？
How can I rest?

242
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,470
当他们到了唱歌的风车，发现没有钱，他们会杀了他。
When they get to the singing windmill and find no money, they will kill him.

243
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,850
我的儿子，有太多的树和太少的时间。
My son, there are too many trees and too little time.

244
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,520
然后，我必须得到这50000美元的另一种方式。
Then I must get this $50,000 another way.

245
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,530
如何？偷窃？没有荣誉的。
How? By stealing? There is no honor in that.

246
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,950
除非我偷了那些没有荣誉的人。
Unless I steal from those who have no honor.

247
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,240
哦…我喜欢。
Ooh... I like that.

248
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,250
但这太危险了。
But it is too dangerous.

249
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,790
我会送你十我们最强的勇士。
I will send ten of our strongest braves with you.

250
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,210
没有
No.

251
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,340
勇士队将在白人的世界太残酷的对待。
The braves would be treated too cruelly in the white man's world.

252
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,630
他们中的很多人可以通过苍白的脸。
A lot of them can pass for pale face.

253
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,930
熊的熊可以给一个白人大的印象。
Raging Bear can actually do a great impression of a white guy.

254
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,970
嘿，伙计们，让我们打我们的胸部头发，吃土豆片。
Hey, guys, let's play with our chest hair and eat potato chips.

255
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,480
那不是很好吗？他是从哪里来的？
Wasn't that great? Where does he come up with this stuff?

256
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,310
那很好，熊，但我必须独自走这条路。
That's very good, Bear, but I must walk this path alone.

257
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,240
我的爱…我会得到这笔钱…
My love... I will get this money...

258
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,610
把它带到了唱歌的风车，
bring it to the singing windmill,

259
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,780
和我们结婚的时间。
and be back in time for our wedding.

260
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,740
我不会让你走。
I won't let you go.

261
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,990
那些男人是杀手。
Those men are killers.

262
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,370
我是个胆小鬼，我妈妈付出了代价。
I was a coward once and my mother paid the price.

263
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,710
这不会发生在我的父亲。
That will not happen to my father.

264
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
哇！
Whoa!

265
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,770
早上好。
Good morning.

266
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,690
你从地狱来的地方？
Where in the hell did you come from?

267
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,860
我有点绑，男孩。
I'm in a bit of a bind, boys.

268
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,740
我骑着所有的出路，淘金
I rode all the way out here to pan for gold

269
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,870
我的马起来，死在我身上。
and my horse up and died on me.

270
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,450
他怎么死的？
How'd he die?

271
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,160
自杀。
Suicide.

272
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,040
淹死了。
Drowned himself.

273
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,500
把他的头放在小溪里，把它放在那里。
Put his head in the stream and just kept it there.

274
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,170
你见过的最伤心的事。
Saddest thing you ever seen.

275
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,170
它发生。
It happens.

276
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,210
不喜欢承认的权力，但它会发生。
Powers that be don't like to admit it, but it happens.

277
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,470
他看起来像个诚实的白人。
He looks like an honest white guy.

278
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,300
上车。
Hop on.

279
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,220
非常感谢。
Much obliged.

280
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,640
就在最近的城镇把我扔下。
Just drop me off at the nearest town.

281
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,270
女士们，先生们，聚集在一起。
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.

282
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,440
听到医生的神奇效应Chubb的Vita油，
Hear the wondrous effects of Dr. Chubb's Vita Oil,

283
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,900
治愈1001种疾病的奇迹。
the miracle cure for 1001 ailments.

284
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,820
放回你的活力…
Put the pep back in your...

285
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,620
这是谁的混蛋？
Who's this asshole?

286
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,340
好了，现在，看这家伙，从马饮水槽。
Well, now, look at this fella, drinking from the horse trough.

287
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,430
原谅我。
Excuse me.

288
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,930
你在那里！
You there!

289
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,060
你正在做的是令人恶心的。
What you're doing is disgusting.

290
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,480
那水是我们的脏马。
That water is for our filthy horses.

291
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,860
水从天空的精神，为所有的孩子。
Water flows from the sky spirit for all its children.

292
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,150
是不是对，表哥？
Isn't that right, cousin?

293
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,200
我们没有棉花，摩根吸烟废话围绕这些部分。
We don't cotton to that peyote-smoking nonsense around these parts.

294
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,240
你听到我说“表哥”吗？
Do you hear me, "cousin"?

295
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,580
好了，威廉，来吧。
Okay, William, come on back.

296
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,120
嘿，朋友。
Hey, <i>amigo.</i>

297
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,750
你打算呆在镇上吗？
You planning on staying in town?

298
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,210
可能需要一个地方放我的头。
Might need a place to lay my head for a bit.

299
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,430
很抱歉那个侮辱你的人。
Sorry about that ugly man that insulted you.

300
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,640
他经营银行，所以他认为他有资格对每个人都有意思。
He runs the bank, so he thinks he's entitled to be mean to everyone.

301
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,600
这个镇上有一家银行？
There's a bank in this town?

302
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,400
为什么？你想抢吗？
Why? You wanna rob it?

303
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,690
我看起来像一个银行抢劫犯你，夫人？
I look like a bank robber to you, ma'am?

304
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,690
有趣的是，有一些关于你的东西，让我想起了某银行抢劫犯。
Funny, there's something about you that reminds me of a certain bank robber.

305
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,240
他的名字是弗兰克stockburn。
His name was Frank Stockburn.

306
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,700
你知道弗兰克stockburn？
You know Frank Stockburn?

307
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,870
“知道”？喜欢，在圣经意义上？
"Know"? Like, in the biblical sense?

308
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,370
不，夫人。你以前见过他，这是我的要求。
No, ma'am. You've met him before is what I'm asking.

309
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,830
是的，我遇见了他。
Yes, I met him.

310
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,380
然后，20分钟后，
Then, 20 minutes later,

311
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,920
我知道他在床上的感觉，在那里。
I knew him in the biblical sense on that bed, right there.

312
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,010
哦
Oh.

313
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,970
我也认识他，在圣经的意义上，两次在这栏杆上。
And, I knew him, in the biblical sense, twice on this railing.

314
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,060
嗯哼。
Uh-huh.

315
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,480
然后，在做倒立，你靠在梳妆台上。
And then, while doing a handstand on that dresser you're leaning against.

316
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,270
他有没有提到一个唱歌的风车？
Did he happen to mention a singing windmill?

317
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,190
他确实提到了一个唱歌的风车。
He did mention a singing windmill.

318
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,150
他说这听起来像是一个天使合唱团。
He said it sounded like a choir of angels.

319
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,950
他说那是什么？
Where'd he say it was?

320
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:46,040
他说，这是在一个地方，他取得了最大的成绩。
He said that it was in a place where he made his biggest score.

321
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,160
不管那是什么。
Whatever that was.

322
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,500
然后他笑了。
And then he laughed.

323
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,790
他喜欢笑…
He liked to laugh...

324
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,880
和倒立性。
and have handstand sex.

325
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,840
是的，我们得去过去。
Yeah, we gotta get past that.

326
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,170
我想念他。
I miss him.

327
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,220
但他却让我想起他。
But he did leave me something to remember him by.

328
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,680
这是什么？
What's this?

329
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,180
镍?啊，拉蒙。
A <i>ni?o,</i> Ramon.

330
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,390
我有一个哥哥？
I have a brother?

331
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,440
哦，小毛驴，我们一起经历了许多冒险，你和我。
Oh, Burro, we had many adventures together, you and me.

332
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,020
我们没有得到任何年轻。
We're not getting any younger.

333
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,190
至少我们有我们的记忆。
At least we have our memories.

334
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,990
记得两个女孩，姐妹，在枯枝？
Remember the two girls, the sisters, in Deadwood?

335
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,370
你喜欢胖人。
You liked the fat one.

336
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,700
你知道这是真的。
You know it's true.

337
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,290
洛佩兹拉蒙？
Ramon Lopez?

338
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,620
的í。
<i>Sí.</i>

339
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,420
我刚从conversating你妈妈来了，比。
I just came from conversating with your mother, Esmerelda.

340
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,430
我们偶然发现了你的爸爸和我的爸爸…
We stumbled upon the fact that your dad and my dad...

341
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,760
都是一样的家伙。
are the same fella.

342
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,930
哦，那太好了。
Oh, that's neat.

343
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,680
是啊
Yeah.

344
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,980
同父。
Same father.

345
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,150
半兄弟。
Half-brothers.

346
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,190
你认为怎么样，驴子？
What do you think about that, Burro?

347
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,900
那么，爸爸呢？
So, how is Dad?

348
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,070
好了，他去了，自己被绑架了，
Well, he went and got himself kidnapped,

349
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,990
我需要拿出50000美元来挽救他的生命。
and I need to come up with $50,000 to save his life.

350
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,450
这是一个很大的比索。
That's a lot of pesos.

351
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,660
当然是。
Sure is.

352
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,960
这就是为什么我就去抢银行在镇。
That's why I'm fixin' to rob the bank here in town.

353
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,290
挂上。
Hang on.

354
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,960
我父亲有麻烦了。
My father is in trouble.

355
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,970
我的兄弟，他需要我的帮助。
My brother, he needs my help.

356
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,680
我将与你抢银行。
I'll rob the bank with you.

357
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,680
我必须独自做这件事。
I must do this alone.

358
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,310
现在发生了什么事？
What's happening right now?

359
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,320
自从我佩克?O，
Ever since I'm <i>peque?o,</i>

360
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,150
我梦想有一天我父亲花魔法，
I dream about spending one magical day with <i>mi padre,</i>

361
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,120
分享食物，把他介绍给驴子。
sharing meals, introducing him to the burro.

362
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,000
我不会放过你，直到你说我可以帮助你。
I will not let go of you until you say I can help you.

363
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,710
如果我说是的话，你会不停的刷牙？
Will you stop brushing me if I say yes?

364
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,880
可以
Yes.

365
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,300
然后你可以帮助。
Then you can help.

366
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,860
这意味着他喜欢你。
That means he likes you.

367
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,800
你要我们借给你的钱很好。
That's a good amount of money you want us to lend you.

368
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,920
现在，通常情况下，我们需要2种形式的识别，夫人，
Now, normally, we would require two forms of identification, madam,

369
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,970
但是，这是没有必要的，在你的情况下。
but that won't be necessary in your case.

370
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,970
我有点内疚的感觉，驴子，
I feel kinda guilty about this, Burro,

371
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,890
从好人的钱。
taking money from nice people.

372
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,310
我的意思是，你不喜欢你的墨西哥。
I mean, it's not like you're some greasy Mexican.

373
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,690
现在我觉得不那么内疚了。
I feel less guilty now.

374
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,480
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

375
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,490
这是一家银行！
This is a bank!

376
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,320
把驴从这里出去！
Get that donkey out of here!

377
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,110
它是一头驴子，SE?或。
It is a burro, <i>se?or.</i>

378
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,990
我不在乎，“硒?或得到它。”！
I don't care, <i>"se?or."</i> Get it out!

379
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,830
所有权利。VáMONOS。
All right. <i>Vámonos.</i>

380
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,710
驴子不想VáMONOS。
The burro don't want to <i>vámonos.</i>

381
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,670
嗯，我真的不在乎他想要的。
Well, I don't really care what the burro wants.

382
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,630
离开我的银行，你野兽！
Get out of my bank, you beast!

383
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,180
我知道你在想什么，但还不知道。
I know what you're thinking, but not yet.

384
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,550
抓住它。
Hold it.

385
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,560
移动！
Move!

386
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,570
这是怎样的混蛋了吗？
How is this jackass stuck?

387
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,450
如果它在这里，它可以肯定！
If it got in here, it can certainly get out!

388
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,240
它没有意义，这是不合乎逻辑的。
It doesn't make sense, it's not logical.

389
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,250
他们把它关好了，是吗？
They got it locked up good, do they?

390
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,670
哦你要离开！
Oh! You are leaving!

391
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,210
胆荡，他砍倒了他扫兴！
Gall dang, he felled on his pooper!

392
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,150
?这没有意义！?我道歉。
- That makes no sense! - I apologize.

393
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,570
?我不知道我能有多少次…?嘿，朋友。
- I don't know how many times I could... - Hey, friend.

394
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,480
需要任何帮助了她？
Need any help gettin' her out?

395
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,190
她不是真的卡住了，朋友。
She's not really stuck, <i>amigo.</i>

396
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,860
她只是一个消遣。
She's just a diversion.

397
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,070
她是处女？
She's a virgin?

398
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,240
我是处女…
I'm a virgin, too...

399
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,290
除非你把活泼的放大镜。
unless you count canty-loupes.

400
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,370
我相信，但她是一种消遣
I believe that, but she's a diversion

401
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,040
让银行忙
to keep the banker busy

402
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,790
让我弟弟有时间抢劫银行。
so that my brother has time to rob the bank.

403
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,960
你说抢劫银行？
You're robbin' the bank?

404
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,760
?胆！嘘，嘘。
- Gall dang! - Shh, shh.

405
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,340
胆。胆。胆。
Gall dang. Gall dang. Gall dang.

406
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,140
哦，不，哦，不。
Oh, no. Oh, no.

407
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,980
没有维吉尔！维吉尔，关键！
No! Virgil! Virgil, the key!

408
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,320
我的小皮特。
I'm Lil Pete.

409
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,030
所以，你的父亲，像，大皮特？
So, is your father, like, Big Pete?

410
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,120
我不知道我的爸爸
I didn't know my pa.

411
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,540
但他是一个银行抢劫犯喜欢你们！他的名字是坦率的。
But he was a bank robber like y'all! His name was Frank.

412
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,460
- stockburn？你怎么知道的？
- Stockburn? - How'd you know?

413
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,210
你是一个巫师吗？
Are you a wizard?

414
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,550
嘿，约翰。
<i>Hey, Johnny Law.</i>

415
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,380
我们会在颚骨等待你跌倒。
<i>We'll be waiting for you up at Jawbone Falls.</i>

416
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,970
弗兰克stockburn。
<i>Frank Stockburn.</i>

417
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
什么？
What?

418
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,850
抢劫！
Robbery!

419
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,180
我们被抢劫了！
We're being burgled!

420
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,690
你！马饮水机！
You! Horse-water-drinker!

421
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,100
你被抓住了，先生！
You are caught, sir!

422
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,120
哦
Oh!

423
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,870
你是什么？
What are you?

424
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,660
嘿，汤米，你猜怎么了？我们有一个小弟弟。
Hey, Tommy, guess what? We got ourselves a little brother.

425
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,870
是啊我们所有的妈妈里，由同一个逃犯。
Yeah! All our moms got porked by the same outlaw.

426
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,840
-那不是吗？-是的，这是一点。
- Ain't that a pip? - Yeah, that's something.

427
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,710
嘿！这些土匪刚抢了银行！
Hey! Those <i>bandidos</i> just robbed the bank!

428
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,010
品尝我的子弹，你肮脏的外国人！
Taste my bullets, you dirty foreigners!

429
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,550
现在
Now!

430
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,350
-不错，驴子。哇！

431
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,730
?它们是！?我们更好地制造铁轨。
- There they are! - We better make tracks.

432
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,310
我能来吗？我有一辆旅行车。
Can I come with? I got a wagon.

433
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,270
好吧，那不是个坏主意，我们走吧。
All right, that ain't a bad idea, let's go.

434
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,860
VáMONOS。加油！
<i>Vámonos.</i> Come on!

435
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,610
所以，如果你们是我的兄弟，
So, if you guys are my brothers,

436
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,450
你必须有三个乳头，太。
you must got three nipples, too.

437
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,740
我只有两只。
I only got two.

438
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,370
是的，刚刚得到了。
Yeah, just got the two.

439
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,660
哦，一定是我妈妈的身边。
Oh, must be from my mama's side.

440
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,620
我忘了告诉你，好吗？
Forget I tolded you that, okay?

441
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,790
将做。
Will do.

442
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,080
你准备好了，克莱姆？
Are you ready, Clem?

443
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,670
是的，是的。我..我准备好了。
Yep, yep. I'm... I'm ready.

444
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,050
匙。
Spoon.

445
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,100
该死的。
Damn sharp.

446
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,190
看，伙计们，我想找这个白色的印第安下来同你一样。
Look, fellas, I wanna hunt this white Injun down same as you.

447
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,030
但是，呃…一。
But, uh... I...

448
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,360
我的眼睛有些问题。
I have some problems with my eyes.

449
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,450
你想加入左眼睛帮，右眼必须出来。
You wanna join the Left-Eye Gang, that right eye has gotta come out.

450
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,540
它只会伤害一秒。
It'll only hurt for a second.

451
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,200
是的，像一百秒。
Yeah, like a hundred seconds.

452
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,170
-那么你就是我们中的一个。?为生活。
- Then you're one of us. - For life.

453
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,210
好吧，这很有意义。
Okay, that makes sense.

454
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,010
如果我把这把左眼挖出来了，好吗？
Is it okay if I scoop this left eye out?

455
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,840
这是…我基本上是盲人。
This is... I'm basically blind here.

456
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,090
这对一个像一只鹰。
This right one sees like an eagle.

457
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,100
是的，它看起来像一个废物，我会
Yeah, it just seems like a waste that I'd...

458
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,520
我理解你的困境，但规则就是规则。
I understand your predicament, but rules is rules.

459
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,100
是的，猜测…有意义。
Yeah, guess it... makes sense.

460
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,030
哦，上帝！
Oh, God!

461
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,490
地狱，没有！
Hell, no!

462
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,280
这是不正确的！
That ain't right!

463
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,700
该死
Damn!

464
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,120
这是一半的方式。
It's half way.

465
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,000
?这是一个静脉晃！-哇！哦，人！
- It's dangling by a vein! - Whoo! Oh, man!

466
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,370
这是疯狂的，我仍然可以看到它！
It's crazy, I can still see out of it!

467
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,880
-该死的，它伤害！我想我要吐了。
- Goddamn, it hurts! - I think I'm gonna puke.

468
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,250
只是去团团像脱衣舞女咪咪流苏！
It's just going round and round like a tassel on a stripper's titty!

469
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,920
好吧，要得到它，得到它！
Okay, gotta get it, gotta get it!

470
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,550
我晕了！
I'm getting dizzy!

471
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,300
得到它，得到它，得到它！
Got it, got it, got it!

472
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
是啊
Yeah!

473
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,180
啊！
Ah!

474
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,140
哦，主！天啊
Oh, Lord! Holy shit.

475
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,020
你做到了，合作伙伴。欢迎您的左眼睛帮。
You done it, partner. Welcome to the Left-Eye Gang.

476
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,150
喔！
Whoo!

477
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,480
我做到了！
I did it!

478
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,650
我很高兴这样做。
I'm glad that's done.

479
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,610
让我们去印第安爱婊子养的，是吧？
Let's just go get that Injun-loving son of a bitch, huh?

480
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,740
是啊
Yeah.

481
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,910
-是的！让我们让他。-是的。
- Yeah! Let's get him. - Yeah.

482
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,200
喜欢，所以…
Like, so...

483
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,370
哦，我碰了这个洞。我碰了这个洞！
Oh, I touched the hole. I touched the hole!

484
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,250
给我一个补丁！
Got me a patch!

485
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,130
亲爱的妈妈，你也许在想
<i>Dear Mama, you may be wondering</i>

486
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,380
为什么我没有回来，从我的冰淇淋店。
<i>why I have not returned from my trip to the ice cream store.</i>

487
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,850
因为我遇见了我的兄弟，拉蒙和汤米。
<i>It's because I met my brothers, Ramon and Tommy.</i>

488
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,100
我们想偷钱。
<i>And we're trying to steal money.</i>

489
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,730
我们需要钱给坏男人
<i>We need the money to give to the bad men</i>

490
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,650
谁把爸爸带到了唱歌的风车之地。
<i>who took Pa away to the land of the singing windmill.</i>

491
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,610
汤米说从正派的人拿钱是不好的。
<i>Tommy says it's not okay to take money from decent folks.</i>

492
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
我得到的钱！
I got the money!

493
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,530
幸运的是，在西方有很多不好的人。
<i>Luckily, there's a lot of bad people here in the West.</i>

494
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,200
绮山楂！
Yee-haw!

495
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,500
让我们骑！
Let's ride!

496
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,000
吃它！你知道你喜欢它。
Eat it! You know you like it.

497
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,790
你知道你喜欢它。
You know you like it.

498
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,670
好神！
Good God!

499
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,260
好的驴子！
Good burro!

500
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,590
这是正确的。
That's right.

501
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
享受它！
Enjoy it!

502
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,180
-这是错误的。是的，是的。
- That's just wrong. - Yeah, yeah.

503
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
是吗？
Is it?

504
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,450
这是比哈密瓜好太多了。
This is so much better than the cantaloupe.

505
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,540
好的驴子！
Good burro!

506
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,370
慢慢地，但肯定，
<i>Slowly, but surely,</i>

507
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,210
我们在50000美元的芯片管脚不需要保存参数
<i>we're chippin' away at the $50,000 we need to save Pa.</i>

508
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,720
那是很多钱，不是吗，妈妈？
<i>That's a lot of money, isn't it, Mama?</i>

509
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,430
妈妈？
<i>Mama?</i>

510
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,560
哦，是的，这是正确的。我写信给你。
<i>Oh, yeah, that's right. I'm writing you a letter.</i>

511
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,900
不管怎么说，我等不及要真正满足我的爸爸
<i>Anyways, I can't wait to actually meet my pa.</i>

512
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,520
我要他教我如何做婴儿。
<i>I want him to teach me how you make babies.</i>

513
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,070
如何与夫人拉出来。
<i>And how the lady poops 'em out.</i>

514
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,610
快到家了。
<i>Be home quick as I can.</i>

515
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,910
爱你的儿子，小皮特。
<i>Your loving son, Lil Pete.</i>

516
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,470
汤米？
Tommy?

517
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,350
是啊，小皮特？
Yeah, Lil Pete?

518
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,190
唱歌的风车在哪里？
Where's the singing windmill?

519
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,820
这是爸爸最大的成绩。
It's where dad made his biggest score.

520
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,990
也许我们会得到另一个线索在颌骨瀑布。
Maybe we'll get another clue up at Jawbone Falls.

521
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,490
这就是他用来隐藏时，他是一个逃犯。
That's where he used to hide out when he was an outlaw.

522
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,700
哦，酷豆。
Oh, cool beans.

523
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,620
汤米？
Tommy?

524
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,630
是啊，小皮特？
Yeah, Lil Pete?

525
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,590
如果我们被抓到偷窃…
If we get caught stealing...

526
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,960
我们会有麻烦吗？
would we be in trouble?

527
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,550
我想我们会挂。
I reckon we'll hang.

528
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,470
怎么样这是没有麻烦。
Well... that's no bother.

529
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,480
我有一个真正的强大的脖子。
I got a real strong neck.

530
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,520
妈妈让我用我的头拉犁如果我不完成我的学业。
Mama makes me pull the plow with my head if I don't finish my schoolwork.

531
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,280
这发生regularilly。
Which occurs regularilly.

532
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,910
强壮的脖子可能会很方便。
Strong neck might come in handy.

533
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,870
好吧，让我们休息一下。
Okay, let's get our rest.

534
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,330
晚安，汤米。
Good night, Tommy.

535
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,080
晚安，小皮特。

536
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,580
晚安，拉蒙。

537
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,090
晚安，兄弟们。
Good night, brothers.

538
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,250
晚安，小毛驴。
Good night, Burro.

539
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,220
这是一个干燥的。
That's a dry one.

540
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,260
明天我们会有好的天气。
We will have good dry weather tomorrow.

541
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,530
嘘，飞！
Shoo, fly!

542
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,740
嘘！
Shoo!

543
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,370
哦，来吧，飞，VáMONOS！我们需要睡眠。
Oh, come on, fly, <i>vámonos!</i> We need our sleep.

544
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,370
让我来照顾这个。
Let me take care of this.

545
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,210
你怎么能在黑暗中看见一只苍蝇？
How can you see a fly in the dark?

546
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,540
一个真正的猎人看到他的所有的感觉。
A true hunter sees with all his senses.

547
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,050
那是一些神秘的东西，人。

他应该知道他在这里不受欢迎。

553
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,610

那对你有一定的影响。

好吧，让我得到这个。

听起来像是一匹马飞。
Sounded like a horse fly.

557
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,800
那不是一匹马飞，那是我的马！

我们应该去吗？

Now, son, I would simply recommend that you stop doing

680
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,000
无论你做了什么，

681
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,250
与任何人…

或者无论你做了什么。

683
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,260
是的，现在他们叫他笑脸，
Yep, now they call him Smiley,

684
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,390
即使犯下最难以形容的暴行，

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,520
一个欢快的笑容从不离开他的脸。
a cheerful grin never leaves his face.

686

但从来没有当谈到我的业务。

希望你和你的饮料都好。
Hope you and your drink are okay.

737
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,640
你为什么想见见这个弗兰克stockburn如此糟糕，是吧？
Why do you want to meet this Frank Stockburn so badly, huh?

738
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,810
弗兰克stockburn的父亲。

739

奇科的权利。渐晚，开始瘦了。
Chico's right. Getting late, starting to thin out.

742
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,420
我能告诉你一些事情吗？
Can I tell you guys something?

743
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,880
因为我不想在我们之间没有秘密。
Because I don't wanna have no secrets between us.

744

当然。

其实是黑色的。
was actually black.

748
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,100
所以，从技术上讲，这让我有一半是黑色的。
So that, technically, makes me half-black.

749
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,980
是不是？
Is that right?

750
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,620
好吧，我不想逃避你
Well, I didn't wanna hide that from you

751
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,480
如果你们搞错了，做了一些种族歧视
in case you guys slipped up and made some racial slurs

752
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,860
?不知道我不是100%个白人。-嗯。
- not knowing I wasn't 100% white. - Hmm.

00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,320
我是说，我知道她一定是真的很强壮，
I mean, I knew she must've been really muscular,

754
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,700
但我不知道她是黑人。
but I had no idea she was black.

755
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,830
是的，我想，我想，

756
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,870
既然你提到了，我就明白了这一点。

758
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,670
我不这么认为。我想她是墨西哥人。
I don't think so. I reckon she's Mexican.

759
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,130
撒谎的婊子！
Lying bitch!

760
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,970
你的新兄弟有什么特殊技能

但当我们把它分开，

我们开始有麻烦的算术。

我只是想把他击倒。

我不认为他从那个人中醒来。
I don't think he's waking up from that one.

841

你在他身上做了一个数字，拉蒙。
You done a number on him, Ramon.

842
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,500
你做了！你在那里做了一个数字。

843
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,840
-是的，你！?嘿！嘿！

844
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,900
计划乙已正式疯狂！

You know everything, Tommy. Where'd you learn all this stuff?

848
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,210
我父亲教我。

不是我们的父亲。尖叫鹰。

他抚养我，因为我是一个孩子。

01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,190
短停。
Short Stop.

953
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,650
是的，好的。
Yes, all right.

954
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,070
罢工三！你出去！
Strike three! You're out!

955
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,290
不，不，球是…太低。
No, no, the ball was... too low.

956
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:33,420
为了把它算作一次打击，它必须经过…
In order for it to count as a strike, it has to pass through the...

957
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,750
走区。
strike zone.

958
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,500
-罢工区？?这是正确的。
- Strike zone? - That's right.

959
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:41,010
如果你不让球过去的我，我的膝盖，我的乳头之间，
And if you don't get the ball past me, between my knees and my titties,

960
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,260
这不是一个打击。
it's not a strike.

961
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,840
这是一个非攻击。
It's a non-strike.

962
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,550
如果你扔我四个非攻击，
And if you throw me four non-strikes,

963
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,680
我有一张票，第一个基地，没有我甚至打它。
I get an express ticket to first base without my even hitting it.

964
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,480
哦
Oh.

965
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,980
好吧，我们准备好了吗？
All right, are we ready?

966
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,730
这也让我第一个基地…以及。
That also gets me to first base... as well.

967
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,290
你要去哪里？没有人打它。
Where you going? Nobody hit it.

968
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,580
我偷了基地。你没在看，所以我偷了它。
I stole the base. You weren't looking, so I stole it.

969
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,790
你说你只能在击球后前进！
You said you could only advance after you hit the ball!

970
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,090
不是你在偷东西。
Not when you're stealing.

971
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:22,800
那是胡说。
That's bullshit.

972
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,130
好，短停。
Okay, Short Stop.

973
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,070
他在动！
He's moving!

974
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,740
安全！
Safe!

975
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,790
胆，我不知道。
Gall dang, I don't know.

976
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:57,880
?这是一条领带。-是的，和领带去赛跑！
- That was a tie. - Yes, and tie goes to the runner!

977
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,540
为什么这么说？
Why's that?

978
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:03,960
因为这些都是即时贴mcschnickens规则，这就是为什么。
Because those are the rules of Stickie McSchnickens, that's why.

979
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,720
好吧，这都是我的，我已经拿到了！
All right, it's all mine, I've got it!

980
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,010
没有不，你不能跑。你不能奔跑。
No! No, you can't run. You cannot run.

981
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:16,020
内野高飞球规则…在充分作用。
Infield fly rule... in full effect.

982
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,810
你出去。
You're out.

983
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,290
我们去这里了，她。好吧，她！
- Here we go, Herm. - Okay, Herm!

984
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,400
是啊
Yeah.

985
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,700
哦
Oh!

986
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,580
哦，我没有得到那个。
Oh, I'm not getting that.

987
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:33,790
是的，好的！
Yeah, <i>bueno!</i>

988
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:37,870
你可以一路跑回家。一个家的赛跑者。
You can just run all the way home. A home runner.

989
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:41,000
我需要一杯冷饮。
I need a cold drink.

990
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:44,800
让我们以一五分钟的时间，然后开始下半场。
Let's take a five-minute stretch and then start the second half.

991
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,590
戴先生，我们做的。
Mr. Doubleday, we're done.

992
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,720
但是，我们只打了九局。
But we've only played nine innings.

993
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,560
九局是不够的。告诉我们关于爸爸最大的成绩。
Nine innings is enough. Tell us about Dad's biggest score.

994
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,220
好极了
Fine.

995
01:06:54,310 --> 01:07:00,690
你的父亲和他的一伙人把整个骑兵团的120名男子撞倒了，
Your father and his gang knocked off an entire cavalry regiment, 120 men,

996
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:03,230
五树干充满了北方佬的钱。
five trunks filled with Yankee money.

997
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:05,690
那会发生什么事？
Where'd that happen?

998
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,700
在甜的猪摇滚…
Up at Sweet Hog Rock...

999
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:10,660
北100英里。
100 miles due north.

1000
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,490
当你看到它的时候你就会知道。
You'll know it when you see it.

1001
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,330
好了，伙计们，
Well, fellas,

1002
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:18,410
看来我们要找一个甜美的猪摇滚来找一个唱歌的风车。
looks like we're going to Sweet Hog Rock to find ourselves a singing windmill.

1003
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,210
但我们仍然需要10000块钱。
But we still need another 10,000 bucks.

1004
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:22,630
我想我们会尽快停下来。
I reckon we'll make a quick stop, then.

1005
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,460
在你走之前…
Before you go...

1006
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,510
你想排队和握手，说“好游戏”，对方？
do you wanna line up and shake hands and say "good game" to each other?

1007
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,130
没有
No.

1008
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,640
他们是很好的家伙。
Them boys were nice fellers.

1009
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,020
以现金支付。保持到最低限度的亵渎。
Paid in cash. Kept the profanity to a minimum.

1010
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:40,020
墨西哥的哥哥用铲子把这头驴的头撞了吗？
And the Mexican brother knocked this hard-ass' head off with a shovel?

1011
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,860
当事飞近40尺！还有a-smilin”。
Dang thing flew nearly 40 feet! And still a-smilin'.

1012
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:44,940
哦人！
Oh! Man!

1013
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,440
而且还没有停止。
And hasn't stopped yet.

1014
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,200
哦，地狱，没有！我的男人上胶头和狗屎！
Oh, hell, no! My man gluing on heads and shit!

1015
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:58,790
希望他胶头回到我的老二。
Wish he'd glue the head back on my pecker.

1016
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,330
你的弟弟怎么了？
What happened to your pecker?

1017
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,670
我加入了你们之前，我是另一个团伙的一部分。
I was part of another gang before I joined up with y'all.

1018
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,840
德克萨斯短桩假肢。
Texas Stubbies.

1019
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,170
好吧，不要介意所有这些。好吗？
Okay, never mind all that. Okay?

1020
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:12,890
现在，医生，你知道他们有6个骑着马走到哪条路吗？
Now, Doc, you know which way them there Ridiculous 6 rode off to?

1021
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,550
我们和他们的一个朋友一起旅行，呃…
We're traveling with a friend of theirs who, uh...

1022
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,720
看到他们将是真正的兴奋。
will be real excited to see them.

1023
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,180
嗯，他们往北去的绿径路。
Well, they headed up north to the Turquoise Trail.

1024
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,900
我可以带你在地图上。
I can show you on the map over here.

1025
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:27,730
期待看到你的男人乞求他的生活？
Looking forward to seeing your man beg for his life?

1026
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,150
因为这是什么事情发生，吸烟狐狸。
'Cause that's what's gonna happen, Smoking Fox.

1027
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,780
水痘！
Chicken pox!

1028
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,780
我们获得的每一天对他的印第安爱屁股。
We're gaining on his Injun-loving ass every day.

1029
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,410
他用左眼睛帮！
He messed with the Left-Eye Gang!

1030
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,660
他会像，
He's gonna be like,

1031
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:46,340
“等等，你是怎么找到我的…你是怎么得到我的女孩的？”
"Wait, how did you find me, and where... How did you get my girl?"

1032
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,550
然后又老又哑的刀，要知道他在他头上。
And then old Dumb Knife's gonna realize that he's in way over his head.

1033
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:57,510
看，当华盛顿发明了美国…
See, when George Washington invented America...

1034
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,870
对不起，警长。
Excuse me, Sheriff.

1035
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:18,740
这个镇上有教堂吗？
Is there a church in this town?

1036
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:22,000
这是响尾蛇的峡谷，你笨蛋。
This is Rattler's Gulch, you halfwit.

1037
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,830
最卑微的，弯曲的，在西方最可怕的小镇。
The meanest, crookedest, most hellacious town in the West.

1038
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,500
我们不需要任何一位牧师告诉我们我们能做什么，不能做什么。
We don't need no preacher telling us what we can and cannot do.

1039
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:32,340
所以，如果我这样做对你的妻子是好的吗？
So it's all right if I do this to your wife?

1040
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,160
我迫不及待地要看到所有你的人，当我悬空！
I can't wait to see all you nice people when I'm dangling!

1041
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,700
你生病的混蛋。
You sick bastard.

1042
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,330
得到这个。
Get this over with.

1043
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:04,200
你今天真的很享受。这会很有趣。
You're in for a real treat today. This is gonna be so much fun.

1044
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:15,300
我在想你。我很好！
I'm just messing with y'all. I'm fine!

1045
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,220
我把这一条鱼称为水。
I call this one Fish Out of Water.

1046
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:32,730
?他穿梭自如?空气
<i>? He flies through the air with the greatest of ease ?</i>

1047
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:36,610
?，大胆的年轻人在空中飞人?
<i>? That daring young man on the flying trapeze ?</i>

1048
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,280
是啊
Yeah!

1049
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,250
是啊
Yeah!

1050
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:49,540
她回来，把妓女。
Herm, put the hookers back.

1051
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,670
加油！
Come on!

1052
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,970
是的，你不能抓住我！
Yeah, you can't catch me!

1053
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,930
他不会死的，比利！他在愚弄你！
He ain't dying, Billy! He's making a fool of you!

1054
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,560
呼呼呼！
Whoo-hoo!

1055
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,640
好吧，那就是！
All right, that's it!

1056
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,520
我们要拍一个婊子养的！
We'll shoot the son of a bitch!

1057
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,230
在我的命令！
On my command!

1058
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,400
准备…
Ready...

1059
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,780
目标…
Aim...

1060
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,150
火！
Fire!

1061
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,870
风把他带了，汤米。该死的接近。
Wind took him, Tommy. Came damn close.

1062
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,170
我很好！
I'm okay!

1063
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,460
来吧，比利！得到他！
Come on, Billy! Get him!

1064
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,090
我们做到了！
We did it!

1065
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,220
我告诉你我有一个强大的脖子！
I told ya I got a strong neck!

1066
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,550
?雅皮士的溜溜球是?
<i>? Yippie-yo-yo-yea ?</i>

1067
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,390
?不会那么伤心?
<i>? Won't be so sad ?</i>

1068
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:47,310
?雅皮士的溜溜球是?
<i>? Yippie-yo-yo-yea ?</i>

1069
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:49,600
?我们想救爸爸?
<i>? We're gonna save Dad ?</i>

1070
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:56,530
我们还得在他们做的前先到甜的。
We still gotta get to Sweet Hog Rock before they do.

1071
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,110
要找到那唱歌的风车，所以它还没有结束。
Gotta find that singing windmill, so it ain't over yet.

1072
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,400
我们得到的钱！
We got the money!

1073
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:03,570
?荒谬的6得到了所有的钱！-是的！
- The Ridiculous 6 got all the money! - Yeah!

1074
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,740
是啊
Yeah!

1075
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,080
汤米！汤米！爸爸喜欢什么？他有趣吗？
Tommy! Tommy! What's Dad like? Is he funny?

1076
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,750
是的，他是一个好的听众吗？
Yeah, is he a good listener?

1077
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,250
他强壮吗？
Is he strong?

1078
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,130
所有重大问题。我会告诉你这个。
All great questions. I'll tell you this.

1079
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,140
我想你们一定会爱他。
I think you guys are gonna love him.

1080
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:27,220
但我肯定他会爱你的。
But I'm sure he's gonna love you guys.

1081
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,270
很抱歉打断了这样一个投标的时刻。
So sorry to interrupt such a tender moment.

1082
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:35,440
看起来我们在洗澡的一天，男孩！
Looks like we stumbled on bath day, boys!

1083
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,820
我听说你在路上捡到了一些兄弟，这家伙。
I heard you picked up some brothers along the way, tough guy.

1084
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,900
但我看不见相似。
But I don't see no resemblance.

1085
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:45,570
我做的，他们看起来都像我的屁眼。
I do, they all look like my butthole.

1086
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:50,750
那么你想什么时候，男孩？
So guess what time it is, boys?

1087
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,120
投资回收期！
Payback time!

1088
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:55,580
最后一句话，没有刀吗？
Any last words, No Knife?

1089
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:04,050
我告诉你我可以把我的呼吸好。
I told ya I could hold my breath good.

1090
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,340
是的，丹尼男孩！
Yeah, Danny boy!

1091
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:08,140
你在做什么，男人？我们得走了！
What are you doing, man? We gotta go!

1092
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:13,190
哦，中奖，男孩！?不！
- Oh, jackpot, boys! - No!

1093
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,190
?这是我们的！-在这里！
- That's ours! - Hyah!

1094
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,490
生锈的！
Rusty!

1095
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:23,900
生锈，不，回来！
Rusty, no, come back!

1096
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,030
没有
No.

1097
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,960
我们要怎么救他？我们是在全。
How are we gonna save him? We're startin' all over.

1098
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,380
有没有更多的好地方我们可以抢劫？
Is there any more good places we can rob?

1099
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:47,180
你知道，像一头驴子梳洗的地方还是一个鞋店的驴子？
You know like a burro-grooming place or a shoe store for burros?

1100
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,600
在西半执法者正在寻找我们。
Half the lawmen in the West are already looking for us.

1101
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,350
那什么？看，我们不能停止。
So what? Look, we can't stop.

1102
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,680
他们要杀死他！
They're going to kill him!

1103
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,150
是不是没有区别。他死了。
Ain't no difference. He's dying anyways.

1104
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,860
爸爸病了。
Dad's sick.

1105
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,650
我很抱歉我没有告诉你们。
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all.

1106
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,990
他已经死了一个很好的机会。
There's a good chance he's dead already.

1107
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,710
但他没有机会。你得去见他，汤米。
But there's a chance he's not. You got to meet him, Tommy.

1108
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,710
我们其他人…
The rest of us...

1109
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:20,290
即使只有五分钟，它还是值得的。
Even if it was just for five minutes, it'd be worth it.

1110
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:26,180
如果我不跟爸爸，我会死在我的胆量这肮脏的秘密烧一个洞。
If I don't talk to Dad, I'll die with this dirty secret burnin' a hole in my guts.

1111
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:30,930
danito，不管你做了什么，你必须原谅自己，人。
Danito, whatever it is you did, you have to forgive yourself, man.

1112
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:33,350
如果你知道我做了什么，你就不会这样说。
You wouldn't say that if you know what I done.

1113
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,890
每个人都有秘密，丹尼。-是的。
- Everybody's got secrets, Danny. - Yeah.

1114
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,350
你们是第一批我告诉我是黑人。
You guys are the first people I told I was black.

1115
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,900
你知道这让我感觉有多好吗？
You know how good that made me feel?

1116
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,070
我们是你的兄弟。
We're your brothers.

1117
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,150
你能告诉我们任何事。
You can tell us anything.

1118
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,030
我，呃…
I, uh...

1119
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:54,120
我曾经为美国总统工作。
I used to work for the President of the United States.

1120
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:57,910
我是他的私人保镖。
I was his personal bodyguard.

1121
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,170
最好的。
One of the best.

1122
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:02,960
直到有一天晚上…
Till one night...

1123
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:11,260
总统先生，说，我要去打那个小男孩的房间。
Mr. President, say, I'm gonna go hit the little boys' room.

1124
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,600
你是在耍我吗？
Are you shitting me?

1125
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,930
加油！你会很好，超级明星。
Come on! You'll be fine, superstar.

1126
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:19,270
我可以在回去的路上给你一些东西吗？阿瓜？啤酒？
Can I get ya something on the way back? <i>Agua?</i> Brewski?

1127
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,480
没有
No!

1128
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,770
林肯太太，如果其中之一大饼干或一个小枕头吗？
Mrs. Lincoln, how about one of them big pretzels or a little pillow?

1129
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,780
我听说这部戏有点长。
I hear this play's kind of a long one.

1130
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,400
好吧，公平。我会回来的。
All right, fair enough. I'll be back in two.

1131
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,370
总统的箱子在哪里？
Where's the president's box?

1132
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:41,080
约翰威尔克斯布斯，演员？-是的。
- John Wilkes Booth, the actor? - Yeah.

1133
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,920
没办法，人！大风扇！
No way, man! Big fan!

1134
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,840
你想对总统说你好吗？-是的。
- You wanna say hi to the president? - Yeah.

1135
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,550
他会得到一个真正的踢出。左上门。
He'd get a real kick out of that. Last door on the left.

1136
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,630
-谢谢。?真的很酷。
- Thank you. - Really cool.

1137
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,140
真的爱那个人！
Wow! Love that guy!

1138
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,650
安倍！
Abe!

1139
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:11,530
你怎么能继续过你的生活，知道你伤害了这么多人？
How can you go on living your life knowing you harmed so many people?

1140
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:13,450
这就是我想问爸爸。
That's what I wanna ask Dad.

1141
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:16,910
嘿，你不是那个扣动扳机的人。
Hey, you ain't the one who pulled that trigger.

1142
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:19,950
但是，如果爸爸有一个谁告诉你…
But if Dad's gotta be the one who tells you that...

1143
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,880
那我们去拿那笔钱吧。
then let's go get that money.

1144
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,460
我只希望我知道。
I just wish I knew how.

1145
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,340
她有了一个主意。
Herm's got an idea.

1146
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,140
他只是不能表达它。
He just can't express it.

1147
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,850
我只是希望有人会说她在这里。
I just wish somebody here could speak Herm.

1148
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,820
明天是情人节。
<i>Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.</i>

1149
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:51,450
那时以西结授予他的年度高赌注的扑克游戏。
<i>That's when Ezekiel Grant has his annual high-stakes poker game.</i>

1150
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:55,280
有很多的钱。很多，我说。
<i>There'll be oodles of money there. Oodles, I say.</i>

1151
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:56,830
哦。
Ooh.

1152
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:59,910
?我不知道。这听起来很危险。?有什么风险？
- I don't know. That sounds risky. - What's risky?

1153
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:04,210
他建议我们…下班结格兰特的扑克游戏。
He's suggesting we... knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.

1154
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,540
明天晚上在尤马。
It's in Yuma tomorrow night.

1155
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:07,880
尤马不到一天的步行从这里。
Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.

1156
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,720
这种扑克游戏，几乎有要军队保护它。
That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protectin' it.

1157
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,970
如果汤米说我们可以打败他们，我会相信他。
If Tommy says we can beat 'em, I'll believe him.

1158
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:19,010
我们都会。
We all will.

1159
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,600
我们可以击败他们。”
We can beat 'em...

1160
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,020
对爸爸。
for Dad.

1161
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,730
对爸爸！
For Dad!

1162
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:45,710
我希望你喜欢我送你的情人节礼物，以西结。
I hope you like the gift I'm giving you for Valentine's Day, Ezekiel.

1163
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:50,130
我会给你一个提示。一小时按摩，不收费。
I'll give you a hint. One-hour massage, no charge.

1164
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,510
哦，苏珊娜。
Oh, Susannah.

1165
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:54,470
你知道什么礼物我真的喜欢吗？
You know what gift I'd really love?

1166
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,220
如果你只是闭嘴！
If you would just shut up!

1167
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,640
没有什么破坏了一个好的扑克游戏…
Nothing ruins a good poker game more...

1168
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,520
比女人叽叽喳喳…
than a lady jabbering on and on...

1169
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,810
多么浪漫。
How romantic.

1170
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:10,730
?你好！?你好！
- Hello! - Hello!

1171
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,190
好吧，将军！
Well, General Custer!

1172
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,610
是的，在你的服务。
Yes, at your service.

1173
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,240
马克吐温。
Mr. Mark Twain.

1174
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,370
?单词！先生们，进来。
- Word up! - Gentlemen, do come in.

1175
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:23,040
哟，泽克，大男孩，我只是去这里的一般关于我的新书。
Yo, Zeke, big boy, I was just going off to the General here about my new book.

1176
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,330
这是汤姆索耶续集。?户外。
- It's a sequel to <i>Tom Sawyer.</i> - Ooh.

1177
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,290
这是关于索亚的家庭片，哈克贝利・费恩。
It's about Sawyer's home slice, Huckleberry Finn.

1178
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,210
白人男孩和兄弟筏。人们会失去他们的大便！
White boy goes raftin' with a brother. People gonna lose their shit!

1179
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:37,630
而且，将军，我看你让你帅气金发头发长出来。
And, General Custer, I see you've let your dashing blond hair grow out.

1180
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,890
嗯，是的，理发师在团是很糟糕的，
Well, yes, the barber down at the regiment is just awful,

1181
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:44,640
所以我有两种选择，要么让它成长或让黄牛。
so I had two choices, either let it grow or get scalped.

1182
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,440
我不会让这种事发生。
And I ain't gonna let that happen.

1183
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,400
现在，我们的老朋友会从墓碑上加入我们吗？
Now, will our old friend from Tombstone be joining us?

1184
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,520
像往常一样。
Late as usual.

1185
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:56,990
但我们有一个新的球员，一个富有的农场主的墨西哥咖啡豆。
But we have a new player, a wealthy Mexican coffee bean rancher.

1186
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:58,150
我tardy-o？
Am I tardy-o?

1187
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,200
哦鬼鬼祟祟的小墨西哥。
Oh. Sneaky little Mexican.

1188
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,660
我可以现在堂堂堂堂堂堂，迭戈。
May I present Don Don Diego.

1189
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,250
我们在这里经营一位绅士的游戏，迭戈先生。
We run a gentleman's game here, Mr. Diego.

1190
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,880
你，嗯，2个保镖是完全不必要的。
Your, uh, two bodyguards are completely unnecessary.

1191
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,800
保镖？
Bodyguards?

1192
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,430
你错了，将军。
You're mistaken, General.

1193
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,430
这是，嗯…
This is, um...

1194
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:24,560
墨西哥春卷…我忠诚的仆人。
Chimichanga... my loyal manservant.

1195
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,390
上帝保佑你。
God bless you.

1196
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,980
嗯，嗯…
And, um...

1197
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,690
布兰科beardio。
Blanco Beardio.

1198
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:36,820
他将为今天下午的庆祝活动提供娱乐节目。
He'll be providing the entertainment for this afternoon's festivities.

1199
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,400
好了，给我打个打。
Well, drop me a beat.

1200
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:45,410
好的
Okay.

1201
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,160
所有权利。
All right.

1202
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,750
现在我们走了。
Here we go now.

1203
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,720
先生们，购买的是15000美元。
Gentlemen, the buy-in is $15,000.

1204
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,220
十五大？
Fifteen large?

1205
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,050
你肯定总蛋奶冻可以荡秋千吗？
Are you sure General Custard can swing that?

1206
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:09,600
这是卡斯特，不是“蛋奶冻。“没有”“我不是一个甜点。
It's Custer, not "Custard." There is no "D." I'm not a dessert.

1207
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,520
我刚把一些讽刺作品放在你的屁股上！
Boom, I just dropped some satire on your ass, General!

1208
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,190
你难住我了
You got me!

1209
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:19,320
嘿！现在，当拉蒙给出的信号，时间是正确的，
Hey! Now, when Ramon gives the signal that the time is right,

1210
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,820
那是我们搬进来的时候。
that's when we move in.

1211
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,360
你还记得这个信号，对吗？
You remember the signal, right?

1212
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,660
?先生们。?你知道去哪儿，元帅。
- Gentlemen. - You know where to go, Marshal.

1213
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,710
哦，地狱，没有！
Oh, hell, no!

1214
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:34,630
那是怀亚特厄普！
That's Wyatt Earp!

1215
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:37,050
最快的枪在西方？
The fastest gun in the West?

1216
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,050
好吧，好吧，好吧！
All right, all right, all right!

1217
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:44,510
哦，怀亚特厄普，为我的生活和呼吸！怀亚特厄普。
- Oh, Wyatt Earp, as I live and breathe! - Wyatt Earp.

1218
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,300
-你在这里！怀亚特厄普。
- You're here! - Wyatt Earp.

1219
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:47,810
对不起我来晚了，大家。
Sorry I'm late, everybody.

1220
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:52,100
但显然，有一些新的团伙在那里抢劫大家盲目。
But apparently, there's some new gang out there robbing everybody blind.

1221
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:53,900
哦，他们称自己是荒谬的6。
Oh, they call themselves the Ridiculous 6.

1222
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:57,520
我发誓，一个人在这片领土上不能骑五英里
I swear, a man can't ride five miles in this territory

1223
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:01,070
没有遇到歹徒，响尾蛇，印第安人和…
without running into outlaws, rattlesnakes, Injuns and...

1224
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:04,030
嘿！你为什么不让我担心的例外？
Hey! Why don't you let me worry about the Injuns?

1225
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:06,370
将做，一般。
Will do, General.

1226
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,120
有什么新鲜事，吐温？
What's shakin', Twain?

1227
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,790
嘿，我对任何事都很好。就像肉汤，宝贝。
Hey, I'm good on anything. Just like gravy, baby.

1228
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,670
见到你很好，我的人。?你也一样。
- Good to see you, my man. - You too, man.

1229
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,420
嘿！我终于看到王子与乞丐。
Hey! I finally read <i>Prince and the Pauper.</i>

1230
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,750
哦，对吗？
Oh, is that right?

1231
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,090
没得到它。
Didn't get it.

1232
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,170
真的吗？
For reals?

1233
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,180
讽刺！繁荣！我得到了雅！
Satire! Boom! I got ya!

1234
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:29,180
我只是拉你的腿。?哦，男人。
- I'm just pulling your leg. - Oh, man.

1235
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,720
我不能读。
I can't read.

1236
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:35,940
好的一个…讽刺。
Good one with the... satire.

1237
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,770
滑稽。
Funny.

1238
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,110
这个笨蛋是谁？
Who's this idiot?

1239
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,660
嗯…我是不…
Um... I am Don...

1240
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,370
唐唐迭戈。
Don Don Diego.

1241
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,700
哦，唐，我是怀亚特…
Well, Don, I'm Wyatt...

1242
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,000
怀亚特怀亚特厄普。
Wyatt Wyatt Earp.

1243
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,670
让他。
Got him.

1244
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:03,470
现在让我们玩一些卡片！
Now let's play some cards!

1245
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:11,850
?说，说汤姆?
<i>? Say, say Tom Sawyer ?</i>

1246
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:12,970
?汤姆・索亚?
<i>? Tom Sawyer ?</i>

1247
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,060
?说汤姆?
<i>? Say Tom Sawyer ?</i>

1248
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:15,600
?汤姆・索亚?
<i>? Tom Sawyer ?</i>

1249
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,770
?说黑人和白人相处?
<i>? Say the blacks and the whites are getting along ?</i>

1250
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,770
?黑人和白人相处?
<i>? The blacks and the whites are getting along ?</i>

1251
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,070
我看不??
<i>? I can't read ?</i>

1252
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:22,230
我看不??
<i>? I can't read ?</i>

1253
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:25,490
请镇定自己！
Please calm yourself!

1254
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:29,910
让我们在这个怀亚特厄普毁了我们的计划之前。
Let's get inside before this Wyatt Earp ruins our plan.

1255
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:32,410
但没有办法让你偷偷越过他们的家伙，汤米。
But there's no way for you to sneak past them guys, Tommy.

1256
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,750
没有石头，没有树，没有什么可以隐藏。
There's no rocks, no trees, no nothing to hide behind.

1257
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:40,290
没有必要躲起来，兄弟，当你是朋友的风。
No need to hide, brother, when you are friends with the wind.

1258
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:43,090
我告诉你，在那里，他们不称之为“墨西哥”。
I'm telling you, down there, they don't call it "Mexico."

1259
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:48,300
它的“mehico。”“X”是一个“H”，我认为德克萨斯是“tehas。”
It's "Mehico." The "X" is an "H." I'm presuming Texas is "Tehas."

1260
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:52,180
现在，这是什么？
Now, what's this?

1261
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,810
只是说，你神经兮兮的混蛋。
Just a tumbleweed, you jumpy bastard.

1262
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,950
这是一些神秘的东西。
That is some mystical shit.

1263
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:21,790
我想把梳妆台移到靠近窗户的窗户上，
I wish to move the dresser in my bedroom closer to the window,

1264
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,130
但我没有力量去做它自己。
but I haven't the strength to do it myself.

1265
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:28,970
我很想帮你，夫人，但我真的应该继续弹钢琴。
I'd love to help, ma'am, but I really should keep playing the piano.

1266
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:33,810
没有人会知道你走了。
No one will even know you're gone.

1267
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,900
先生们，你们的购买惯。?所有权利！
- Gentlemen, cough up your buy-ins. - All right!

1268
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,270
让雨一样吐温。
Make it rain like Twain.

1269
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,070
?采取这一。-是的！
- Take that and that. - Yeah!

1270
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:48,360
肯定是有一些好的烈酒，泽克。你在哪里找到的？
Sure is some good hooch there, Zeke. Where'd you find that?

1271
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,910
哦，我从一个20年前的情况下得到的。
Oh, I got that from a case about, uh, 20 years ago.

1272
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,450
事实上，呃，你知道同居的颚骨瀑布吗？
In fact, uh, you know that shack up by Jawbone Falls?

1273
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:59,080
-是的。?有一位女士住在那里。
- Yeah. - There was a lady living there.

1274
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,750
这是一个坦率的stockburn的情妇。
It was one of Frank Stockburn's many paramours.

1275
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:06,500
这是我有生以来见过的最丑的女人。
Now this was one of the ugliest ladies I've ever seen in my life.

1276
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:08,550
听起来像一个真正的桶屎。
Sounds like a real bucket of turds.

1277
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:12,720
但她是个很有才华的蒸馏酒。
But she was a very talented distiller of alcohol.

1278
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,220
所以，她…
So, while she...

1279
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,680
当她在装我的教练时，她的小男孩出来了，
While she's loading up my coach, her young boy comes out,

1280
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:24,310
这个大步履蹒跚的笨家伙，静音，肮脏如猪，
this big shambling oaf, mute, filthy as a hog,

1281
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,820
他开始做这个可怕的小跳舞
and he starts doing this horrible little tap dance

1282
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,860
虽然唱“星条旗永不落”。
whilst singing "The Star-Spangled Banner."

1283
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:34,240
好吧，不唱的时候，真的，但是，哼哼，像一个穴居人！
Well, not singing it, really, but grunting it, like a caveman!

1284
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,370
？哦，说你能看见吗？
<i>? Oh, say can you see?</i>

1285
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,910
你知道，他要我给他扔几枚硬币，
You know, he wants me to throw him some pennies,

1286
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,960
所以我从口袋里掏出一枚硬币
so I fished a coin out of my pocket

1287
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,040
我想我不知道自己的力量。
and I guess I don't know my own strength.

1288
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:48,760
我扔了它，打在他的嘴里，把他的牙齿！
I tossed it, hit him in the mouth, and knocked his tooth out!

1289
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:52,510
哪一个混蛋！
What an asshole!

1290
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,090
妈妈。
Mama.

1291
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,930
在任何情况下，我仍然有一个瓶子离开的情况下。
In any event, I still have one bottle left from that case.

1292
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:04,650
我去把它拿来，我们可以为那可怕的女人和她那可怕的儿子干杯。
I'll go fetch it and we can drink a toast to that awful woman and her hideous son.

1293
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,280
哦，她是丑陋的！你根本就不会和她一起睡。
Oh, she was ugly! You wouldn't even sleep with her.

1294
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:16,320
说，唐唐迭戈…
Say, Don Don Diego...

1295
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:17,700
你在哪里买的？
where's your buy-in?

1296
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,580
我以为那是15个大男人。
I thought it was 15 grand a man.

1297
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:20,830
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1298
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,120
嗯…
Uh...

1299
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:32,840
让我们看看。啊！
Let's see. Ah!

1300
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:47,690
是你！
It's you!

1301
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:48,900
嗯哼。
Uh-huh.

1302
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:00,080
什么？
What?

1303
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:02,700
什么“什么”？
What "what"?

1304
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,660
你是如此惊讶？
What are you so surprised about?

1305
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:09,500
只是这么惊讶于所有…我们在这里的乐趣，
Just so surprised at all the... the fun that we're having here,

1306
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,880
用卡和钱，酒和…
with the card and the money and the booze and...

1307
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:17,140
你知道，当我把我的水放在早晨的时候，我也会做出同样的表情，
You know, I make that same face when I put my cologne on in the morning,

1308
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,300
特别是当我独自在家的时候。
especially when I'm home alone.

1309
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:20,640
你知道我的想法吗？
You know what I think?

1310
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,430
我认为迭戈不是一个真正的咖啡豆农场在所有。
I think Don Don Diego isn't really a coffee bean rancher at all.

1311
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,190
他真正的目的是为了抢我们。
And his true purpose here is to rob us.

1312
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,190
不要让我杀了你，先生，厄普。
Don't make me kill you, Mr. Earp.

1313
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,940
举起手。
Hands up high.

1314
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,990
哦，单元！你有怀亚特厄普的下降？
Oh, snap! You got the drop on Wyatt Earp?

1315
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:41,620
这是我兄弟。他是个坏男人。
It's <i>mi hermano.</i> He's one bad <i>hombre.</i>

1316
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:46,290
对不起，伙计们。
No disrespect, fellas.

1317
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:49,750
我们要把你绑起来，我们得借你的马。
We're gonna have to tie you up, and we'll have to borrow your horses.

1318
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,590
哦，我错过了什么？
Ooh, what'd I miss?

1319
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:57,260
香猪摇滚，在这里，我们来了！
Sweet Hog Rock, here we come!

1320
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,850
晕了，驴子。
Giddy up, Burro.

1321
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,140
加油，拉蒙！
Come on, Ramon!

1322
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,610
就在你身后，汤米！
Right behind you, Tommy!

1323
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:23,120
快点，驴子！移动你的屁股！
Hurry up, Burro! Move your ass!

1324
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:31,010
哇！哇，哇。
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

1325
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,960
是的，我想我们找到了。
Yeah, I think we found it.

1326
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:40,180
这是一个甜蜜的猪在那里。
That is one sweet hog right there.

1327
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,970
这是一个甜美的，雄伟的猪。
That is a sweet, majestic hog.

1328
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,390
是的，这是一个甜蜜的肯定。
Yeah, that's a sweet one for sure.

1329
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:48,480
这都是正确的。
It's all right.

1330
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:54,150
我很困惑。我看不到一个猪或一头猪。
I'm confused. I don't see a hog or a pig anywhere.

1331
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:57,820
我看到的都是大石头，看起来像一只尿尿。
All I see is the big old rock that looks like a weenie pee-pee.

1332
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,870
哦，你们叫一个“猪”。
- Oh, you guys call a pee-pee a "hog." - Yeah.

1333
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:07,750
?这很奇怪。我喜欢它，虽然。-是的。好的
- That's weird. I like it, though. - Yeah. Okay.

1334
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:10,540
问题是，我看不到任何地方唱歌的风车。
Problem is, I don't see no singing windmill anywhere.

1335
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,500
等一等
Wait...

1336
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,670
我听到了。
I hear it.

1337
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,590
是的，它是从那里来的。
Yeah, it's coming from over there.

1338
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:19,760
啊！爸爸！爸爸！
Ah! Daddy! Daddy!

1339
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:22,590
爸爸！哈？
Daddy! Huh?

1340
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,760
哇…
Whoa...

1341
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,890
我们得救了！我们得救了！
We're saved! We're saved!

1342
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,020
哦，这只是这些混蛋。
Oh, it's just these assholes.

1343
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,810
你们究竟发生了什么事？
What the hell happened to you guys?

1344
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:41,280
我们是到西部去旧金山后我们窃取了你的战利品。
We was headed west to Frisco after we absconded with your loot.

1345
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,910
但我们遇到了这些真正的坏角色。
But we ran into these real bad characters.

1346
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:49,620
它是西塞罗的东西和他的疯狂的团伙。
It was Cicero something and his crazy-ass gang.

1347
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:53,420
他在这里吗？然后他离开了？
Cicero was here? Then he left?

1348
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:57,170
他让我们在泥土里玩的很开心。
He left us in the dirt for fun.

1349
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,800
自己的！自己的！
Ow! Ow, ow!

1350
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:00,550
谁做的？
Who does that?

1351
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,970
精神病人！
Sicko!

1352
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,890
如果这是歌唱的风车的地方，那么为什么他们会起来离开？
If this is where the singing windmill is, then why would they just up and leave?

1353
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:11,390
也许，即时贴mcschnickens家伙是骗我们的。
Maybe that Stickie McSchnickens guy was just pulling our leg.

1354
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,690
他们往北走…大约2小时前。
They went north... about two hours ago.

1355
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:15,980
哦，是的！汤米可以跟踪他们。
Oh, yeah! Tommy can track 'em.

1356
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,980
让我们骑上马鞍。我们正燃烧着白昼。
Let's saddle up. We're burning daylight.

1357
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:19,110
等一等
Wait!

1358
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,650
你不能把我们在这里，你得让我们出去！
You can't just leave us here, you gotta get us out!

1359
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:23,200
你不需要…嘿，嘿，嘿！
You don't need to... Hey, hey, hey!

1360
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,450
我们还有钱！
We still got the money!

1361
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:27,450
是的，我把它藏在我的裤子里。我们会把它还给你！
Yeah, I hid it in my pants. We'll give it back to ya!

1362
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:28,990
我们不需要更多。走吧
We don't need no more. Let's go!

1363
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,620
嘿！你能帮我挑这些蚂蚁吗
Hey! Can you at least help me pick these ants

1364
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:36,330
在我的胡须上，在你的脑袋出来之前？
out of my beard before you head out?

1365
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:37,670
请？
Please?

1366
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:40,250
告诉你，我们会在一个条件下挖你。
Tell you what, we'll dig you up on one condition.

1367
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:42,670
你说的，我们会做的！
You say it, we'll do it!

1368
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,090
你放弃你的生活
That you give up your lives of crime

1369
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:48,470
并借此机会开始做好事的人。
and take this second chance to start doing good by people.

1370
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,930
我宁愿死！?地狱，没有！我不这么做！
- I'd rather die! - Hell, no! I ain't doing that!

1371
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:53,390
没办法！哑印度一半！
No way! Dumb Indian half!

1372
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:55,690
那是个笑话！那是个笑话！
That was a joke! That was a joke!

1373
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:58,060
我将是一个好男孩！我会是个好孩子，爸爸！
I'll be a good boy! I'll be a good boy, Daddy!

1374
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:08,490
现在怎么了？东方还是西方？
Now what? East or west?

1375
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,660
哇。
Whoa.

1376
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:24,170
一天中的晚。
Late in the day.

1377
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:26,840
很多交通都经过这里。
Lot of traffic been going through here.

1378
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:28,510
要花一分钟。
It's going to take a minute.

1379
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:31,640
嗯，我们必须得到强大的关闭。
Well, we must be getting mighty close.

1380
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,810
他们最好是对爸爸好，或者他们要回答我们。
They'd better be treating Dad well, or they're gonna have to answer to us.

1381
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,640
在那里他。
There he is.

1382
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:38,020
这人自己。
There's the man himself.

1383
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,980
看着那个英俊的男人。-是的。
- Look at that handsome <i>hombre.</i> - Yeah.

1384
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,190
那就是我们的好地方。
That's where we get our good looks.

1385
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,440
让我看到的流行。
Let me see ol' Pop.

1386
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,080
他还像那样吗，汤米？
Does he still look like that, Tommy?

1387
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:01,250
汤米？
Tommy?

1388
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:03,710
是的，他做。
Yeah, he does.

1389
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,510
今晚让我们来集中营。就在那里。
Let's set up camp tonight. Right out there.

1390
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:08,930
但我们不能浪费任何时间。
But we can't waste any time.

1391
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:12,180
奇科…我现在不能弄明白。
Chico... I can't figure it out right now.

1392
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:13,430
我得…
I gotta...

1393
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,520
只是给我直到日出。让我想想。
Just give me till sunrise. Let me think.

1394
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,760
亲爱的兄弟们，
<i>Dear brothers,</i>

1395
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:51,140
你读到这一点的时候，我会赶上爸爸的。
<i>by the time you read this, I will have caught up with Dad.</i>

1396
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:55,010
我敢肯定你在我的喉咙痛。
<i>And I'm sure you're sore at me for sneaking out on you.</i>

1397
01:31:55,100 --> 01:32:00,850
但这家伙，西塞罗，谁拿了PA，还把我母亲的生命，
<i>But this fellow, Cicero, who took Pa, also took my mother's life,</i>

1398
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,980
我的意思是让他付出代价。
<i>and I mean to make him pay for that.</i>

1399
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,020
事情可能会变得混乱。
<i>Things might get messy.</i>

1400
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:09,320
我能和我们所做的所有坏东西一起生活，
<i>I can live with all the bad stuff we've done,</i>

1401
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:14,870
很快，盗窃，意外斩首，
<i>the hold-ups, the burglaries, the accidental decapitation,</i>

1402
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:19,330
但我不能和自己生活在一起，如果发生在你的一个。
<i>but I couldn't live with myself if something happened to one of you.</i>

1403
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:24,590
所以留在原地，我会和爸爸一起回来，只要我能。
<i>So stay put and I'll be back with Dad as soon as I can.</i>

1404
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,550
如果我不回来，
<i>And if I don't come back,</i>

1405
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:30,760
我知道我爱你男孩我的心。
<i>know that I love you boys with all my heart.</i>

1406
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,340
你弟弟，汤米。
<i>Your brother, Tommy.</i>

1407
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,320
哇。
Whoa.

1408
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:00,450
在银色峡谷…
<i>Down at Silver Canyon...</i>

1409
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:03,000
会议贝蒂邓森…
Meeting Betty Dunson...

1410
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:06,290
是我最幸运的事情发生在我。
was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me.

1411
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,510
妈妈是他最大的成绩。
Mom was his biggest score.

1412
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:13,180
在这里。
Hyah.

1413
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:22,270
我们在这里。
Here we are.

1414
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:24,650
我们最好别为这一切而来。
We'd better not have come all this way for nothing.

1415
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:27,650
?我要的钱，坦率。我知道你想要什么。
- I want the money, Frank. - I know what you want.

1416
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:30,400
你的钱。
There's your money.

1417
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,650
伯爵。
Count it.

1418
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,490
汤米！
Tommy!

1419
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:34,860
哦，看谁出现了。
Oh, look who showed up.

1420
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:38,370
我不知道是否有人把你埋葬的，爸，
I didn't know if somebody dug up what you buried, Pa,

1421
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:41,040
所以我想确保你被覆盖。
so I wanted to make sure you were covered either way.

1422
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,960
谢谢你，儿子。
Thank you, son.

1423
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,750
好吧，那不是一个好男孩。
Well, ain't that a good boy.

1424
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:46,460
那是我的男孩。
That's my boy.

1425
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,960
嗯，这是一种乐趣，坦率的。
Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

1426
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,800
但是，呃…
But, uh...

1427
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,130
我们将在我们的路上。
we'll be on our way.

1428
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,970
不那么快。
Not so fast.

1429
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:57,090
你和我有一些未完成的业务。
You and me got some unfinished business.

1430
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:59,390
不，我们的生意做得很。
No, our business is done.

1431
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:03,230
参数。你还记得我是怎么跟你说的吗？
Pa... you remember how I told you Ma died?

1432
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:04,310
是啊
Yeah.

1433
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:08,150
好吧，一个女人的儿子开枪…
Well, the son of a bitch who shot her...

1434
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:10,360
他手上有个纹身…
had a tattoo on his hand...

1435
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:14,570
正如西塞罗这里。
just like Cicero here.

1436
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:17,740
你是什么意思…
What, you mean...

1437
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:19,530
我的小马蹄？
my little horseshoe?

1438
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,830
这总是给我带来好运。
That's always brought me luck.

1439
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:24,870
特别是当我拍摄某人。
Especially when I was shooting somebody.

1440
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,170
哦，凶手，你的运气刚刚用完。
Well, killer, your luck just ran out.

1441
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,880
你的手碰那把刀，男孩，
Your hand touch that knife, boy,

1442
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,340
这将是你所接触过的最后一件事。
it'll be the last thing you ever touch.

1443
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,760
哦，我没用这些刀。
Oh, I ain't using these knives.

1444
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,510
没有
No.

1445
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,810
不是我的妈妈。
Not for my mama.

1446
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:46,060
我为你救了一个特别的人。
I saved a special one just for you.

1447
01:35:00,410 --> 01:35:02,580
现在你死了，印第安情人。
Now you die, Injun-lover.

1448
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,670
他死了，你死了。
He dies, you die.

1449
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,380
我们中的十四个，你们中的六个。似乎不太公平，是吗？
Fourteen of us, six of you. Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?

1450
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,800
使我们十二个。
Make that twelve of us.

1451
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:22,470
十二的我们！
Twelve of us!

1452
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:29,350
我是不是为了这个大便。
I ain't sign up for this shit.

1453
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:03,220
你看到了吗？
You seeing this?

1454
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:04,930
?它不工作。?你在干什么？
- It's not working. - What are you doing?

1455
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,890
看起来根本不象风滚草，爱马仕。
Don't look like a tumbleweed at all, Herm.

1456
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,310
爱马仕，回来！回来，她。
Herm, come back! Come back, Herm.

1457
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:12,560
好吧，好吧。现在，大家都冷静下来。
All right, all right. Now, everybody just calm down.

1458
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:16,780
男人的权利…杀死他母亲的凶手。
A man's entitled... to kill his mother's killer.

1459
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:22,530
加…那是一个你不得不把钱分开的人！
Plus... that's one less guy you've got to split the money with!

1460
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:25,370
良好的思想，坦率。让我们骑！
Good thinking, Frank. Let's ride!

1461
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:27,700
-是的！-是的，在这里得到！
- Yeah! - Yeah, get on out of here!

1462
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:34,500
好工作，儿子。我真的为你感到骄傲。
Good job, son. I'm really proud of you.

1463
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:38,590
让你的朋友们一路与你在一起，辉煌。
And getting your friends to come all the way out here with you, brilliant.

1464
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:43,640
好的，先生…他们不只是我的朋友，他们，嗯…
Well, sir... they ain't just my friends, they, uh...

1465
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,760
他们是我的兄弟。
They're my brothers.

1466
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:52,940
五？
Five?

1467
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,110
你玩得很开心，不是吗，先生？
You had fun, didn't you, sir?

1468
01:36:57,690 --> 01:37:00,690
好了，我要介绍一下我自己。
Well, I'm gonna introduce myself.

1469
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,950
我想他们会喜欢的。
I think they'd like that.

1470
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,710
弗兰克stockburn，你爸爸。
Frank Stockburn, your dad.

1471
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:16,840
很高兴认识你。很高兴认识你。
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1472

1473
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:23,050
这是我的驴子。
This is my burro.

1474
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:25,140
为你觉得自豪，驴子。
Proud to know you, Burro.

1475
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,350
他很骄傲。
He's proud.

1476
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:31,770
你一定是，嗯，圣路易斯，对吗？
You must be, uh, Saint Louis, right?

1477
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:33,100
奇科。
Chico.

1478
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:36,350
男孩，你有你妈妈的肌肉。
Boy, you got your mom's muscles.

1479
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:39,020
你有吗？
You a prizefighter?

1480
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,360
不，事实上，我是一个。钢琴演奏者。
No, actually, I'm a... piano player.

1481
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:45,070
哦，好吧，我会！
Oh, well, I'll be!

1482
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:48,990
你知道，我一直知道自己弹钢琴。
You know, I've been known to tickle the ivories myself.

1483
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,080
现在，你知道。
Now and then, you know.

1484
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,410
有时我们应该一起玩。
We should play together sometime.

1485
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:57,170
我会喜欢的，爸爸。
I'd like that, Dad.

1486
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:59,090
我想要很多。
I'd like that a lot.

1487
01:37:59,170 --> 01:38:00,750
是的，儿子，我们会做的。
Yeah, son, we'll do that.

1488
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:13,810
你必须拉的男孩。
You must be Delilah's boy.

1489
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:19,440
男孩，她做了一些罚款，罚款威士忌。
Boy, she made some fine, fine whiskey.

1490
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,730
哦，是的。
Ooh, yeah.

1491
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:26,570
当她怀孕的时候，她一定是很难的。
She must've been really hitting it hard when she was pregnant with you.

1492
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:38,130
好孩子，好孩子。
Atta boy, atta boy.

1493
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:41,000
达。
Da-da.

1494
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:43,130
嗯，呃…你是什么？
And, uh... you are?

1495
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:47,050
我的小皮特。我是你的儿子！我爱你这么多，爸爸！
I'm Lil Pete. I'm your son! I love you so much, Dad!

1496
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,970
我有三个乳头。-是的，很好…
- I have three nipples. - Yeah, well...

1497
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:50,970
拥有一个空闲的很好。
It's always good to have a spare.

1498
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:55,270
-你有一个，你有一个，太？-是的。
- Gall dang, you have one, too? - Yeah.

1499
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:57,100
你喜欢玩多余的吗？
Do you like to play with the extra one?

1500
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:58,650
哦，你知道吗。
Oh, you betcha.

1501
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:01,310
哦，爸，我有个问题要问你。
Oh, Pa, I have a question for you.

1502
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,820
是啊
Yeah.

1503
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:05,820
婴儿是从哪里来的？
Where do babies come from?

1504
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:09,530
好吧，儿子，妈妈只是拉出来。
Well, son, the mom just poops 'em out.

1505
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:13,080
我知道它！我知道，爸爸！
I knewed it! I knewed it, Dad!

1506
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,870
好吧，看看这个英俊的恶魔。
Well, look at this handsome devil.

1507
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,420
先生，我是丹尼。
Sir, I'm Danny.

1508
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,540
很高兴终于见到你。
It's awful nice to finally meet ya.

1509
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:24,170
你能帮我解决一个问题吗？
Could you help me with a problem?

1510
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,210
我真愚蠢
I did a real stupid thing

1511
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:30,890
那不经意间导致了美国总统的死亡，
that inadvertently led to the death of a United States President,

1512
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:35,020
我感觉很糟糕。
and I'm feeling pretty lousy about it.

1513
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:39,020
嗯，儿子…
Well, son...

1514
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,560
看我的眼睛。
look in my eyes.

1515
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,730
发生了。
Shit happens.

1516
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:47,780
是啊
Yeah.

1517
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:50,110
是的，对。
Yeah, right.

1518
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,490
谢谢谢谢您，先生。
Thanks. Thank you, sir.

1519
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:53,950
不客气
You're welcome.

1520
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:57,160
那么，到现在，对吧？
So, where to now, huh?

1521
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:00,790
好了，先生，吸烟狐狸和我在几天内结婚，
Well, sir, Smoking Fox and me are getting married in a few days,

1522
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:04,130
和尖叫鹰的走她在过道，
and Screaming Eagle's walking her down the aisle,

1523
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:07,380
我希望…
and I was hoping...

1524
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,840
你可以在那里，在我旁边。
you could be there, next to me.

1525
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:12,640
哦，你是说你最好的男人？
Oh, you mean your best man?

1526
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,140
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

1527
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,010
哦，汤米…
Oh, Tommy...

1528
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:18,730
你知道，那是..这是相当的荣誉。
You know, that's... that's quite an honor.

1529
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:21,350
这将是我的荣幸，先生。-是的。嗯，嗯…
- It would be my honor, sir. - Yeah. Well, uh...

1530
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:27,530
但不幸的是，我。
But unfortunately, I...

1531
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:30,990
我有一些商业上的北方，我必须参加。
I got some business up north that I gotta attend to.

1532
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:34,120
我要收集一些赌博的债务和…
I gotta collect some gambling debts and...

1533
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,910
你知道，只是为了支付医生的报酬。
You know, just to pay the doctors and such.

1534
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,460
说，爸爸。你永远不需要再担心钱了。
Say, Dad. You don't ever gotta worry about money ever again.

1535
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:44,250
我们不得不联想到50大两倍！
We had to conjure up 50 grand twice!

1536
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,290
因此，我们结束了100！
So we ended up with 100!

1537
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:48,660
?一百？-是的，先生。
- A hundred? - Yes, sir.

1538
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,920
还有另外50个大？
There's another 50 grand?

1539
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:52,760
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

1540
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,680
在这里，在驴子的工具包。
Right here, in the burro's saddlebag.

1541
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:00,890
所以，企业可以在北等待，不能…最好的男人？
So that business can wait up north, can't it... best man?

1542
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:06,770
好吧，既然你提到了，也许我应该改变我的计划。
Well, now that you mention it, maybe I should change my plans.

1543
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:09,530
-好的。布埃诺。-是的。
<i>- Bueno. Bueno.</i> - Yeah.

1544
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,200
嘿！他们在做什么？
Hey! What are they doing back?

1545
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,880
这是什么？
What is this?

1546
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:28,550
我想是时候你孩子
I guess it's time you kids

1547
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:33,260
得知你亲爱的老爸爸的真相，是吧？
learned the truth about your dear old dad, huh?

1548
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:36,800
我太有名了。
I'm just too famous.

1549
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:40,020
我不能走到落基山脉的任何城镇西
I can't walk into any town west of the Rockies

1550
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,850
没有人打电话。
without someone calling the law.

1551
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:47,310
所以，我想出了一个办法，我们可以使50个大
So, I came up with a way we could make 50 grand

1552
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,480
没有举起一根手指。
without lifting a finger.

1553
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:53,450
你给我们带来了双重的无赖！
And you rascals brought us double!

1554
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:55,860
这些是我的孩子还是什么？
Are these my kids or what?

1555
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,410
一个婊子养的！
Son of a bitch!

1556
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,370
如果我们的两个帮派势力加入，
If our two gangs joined forces,

1557
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:06,370
没有一个执法者在西方，会站起来反对我们。
there's not a lawman in the West that would stand up against us.

1558
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:09,210
是什么让你认为我们会变成一个犯罪的生活？
What makes you think we'd turn to a life of crime?

1559
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,210
因为这是你的血。
'Cause it's in your blood.

1560
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:13,260
回答我。
Answer me something.

1561
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:18,890
你在生活中的任何事情都是伟大的，除了偷窃吗？
Were you ever great at anything in your life besides stealing?

1562
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,270
号
No. No.

1563
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:26,190
你的苹果并没有从这棵树上掉下来。
You apples didn't fall far from this tree.

1564
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:28,610
不要否认你是谁。
Don't deny who you are.

1565
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:31,360
如果你知道我们是谁，
If you knew who we really were,

1566
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,070
你会很害怕现在。
you'd be very scared right now.

1567
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:39,280
不要夸大你的手，儿子。
Don't overplay your hand, son.

1568
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:43,120
我还抱着一个王牌。
I'm still holding an ace.

1569
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,670
我发现她。一。
I found her. I...

1570
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,220
我告诉过你我会找到她。
I told you I'd find her.

1571
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:05,020
这只小美女在几天前无意中发现了我们的营地。
This little beauty stumbled into our camp a few days ago.

1572
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:10,190
她实际上是想救我。
She actually tried to rescue me.

1573
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:15,150
我猜这意味着你不想让我成为你最好的男人，对吧？
I'm guessing this means you don't want me to be your best man no more, huh?

1574
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:21,120
好吧，我要把这个简单的给你。
Well, I'm gonna make this real simple for you.

1575
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:28,580
另50个大的手…在那个愚蠢的工具包，
Hand over the other 50 grand... in that stupid ass' saddlebag,

1576
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:34,000
我把一颗子弹在她漂亮的Apache的头。
or I put a bullet in her pretty Apache head.

1577
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,180
那是不会发生的。
That ain't gonna happen.

1578
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,220
哦，不是吗？
Oh, it ain't?

1579
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,590
不，先生。
No, sir.

1580
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:43,810
为什么这么说？
Why's that?

1581
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:46,770
嗯…秘密的种类。
Mmm... kind of a secret.

1582
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:50,940
嗯，你可以告诉你的老男人，是不是？
Well, you can tell your old man, can't ya?

1583
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,860
你知道那个袋子…
You know that bag...

1584
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:58,360
?你男孩的控股？?恩。
- your boy's holding? - Uh-huh.

1585
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:00,820
它的意思是西塞罗。
It was meant for Cicero.

1586
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:03,910
所以在那里有一些特别的东西。
So there's something special in there.

1587
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:06,450
?计划B计划？
- Plan B. - Plan B?

1588
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:07,700
计划B
Plan B.

1589
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,540
把那个袋子给我。
Give me that bag.

1590
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:18,800
哦，该死！
Oh, shit!

1591
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,800
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1592
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:47,450
吸烟狐狸。
Smoking Fox.

1593
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:00,840
晚安，儿子。
Nighty-night, son.

1594
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:12,060
丹尼，你还好吗？
Danny, are you all right?

1595
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:16,770
你做得很好，丹尼尔。你救了我。
You done good, Daniel. You saved me.

1596
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:20,940
总统先生，这是我的责任。
It's my duty, Mr. President.

1597
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:26,070
林肯夫人。
Mrs. Lincoln.

1598
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:29,700
加油！加油！来到这里。
Come on! Come on! Come here.

1599
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:35,750
进入。
Get in.

1600
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,020
我得到了一个！
I got one!

1601
01:45:58,110 --> 01:45:59,690
克莱姆，你差点打中我！
Clem, you almost shot me!

1602
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,230
加油，把马！
Come on, get the horses!

1603
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:04,110
我的屁股！我的屁股！
My ass! My ass!

1604
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:08,740
嘿！
Hey!

1605
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:12,290
这在这里还是有效的，或者是太烧了？
Is this here still valid, or is it too burnt up?

1606
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:13,910
让我看一看。

Uh, that looks good to me. I mean, this looks good.

1608
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:17,170
什么在地狱？
What in the hell?

1609
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:19,710
你没把你的，是吗？
You didn't scoop yours out, did you?

1610
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,220
又是什么问题？
What was the question again?

1611
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:26,300
什么？
What?

1612
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,430
你们真的这样做吗？
Did any of you really do it?

1613
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,020
那么，那是谁的眼睛？
Well, then whose eyes are in that jar?

1614
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:37,310
嗯…
Uh...

1615
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,820
嗯，娃娃脸发现一些岩石，和，呃，画。
Well, Babyface found some rocks, and, uh, painted them.

1616
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:42,690
惊讶？

1617
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:59,630
嘿，汤姆，你想玩一个游戏
Hey, Tom, you wanna play a game

1618
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:04,210
为了弥补所有的父亲儿子的时间，我们错过了？

1619
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:05,880
躲猫猫。

1620

1621

不，来那边！

1622

你可以拥有一切，儿子。

1623
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,650
但你必须做正确的事情。

1624
01:47:30,490 --> 01:47:34,490
你的离开让我有一点建议。
Let me leave you with a bit of fatherly advice.

1625
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:41,000
不带刀枪战。

1626

有一天，会有太多，我的爱。

但不是今天。

1628
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:03,070
那是一些神秘的东西。
That was some mystical shit.

1629
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:09,950
汤米。
Tommy.

1630
01:48:10,030 --> 01:48:13,410
你知道西塞罗杀了我妈妈。

1631

不，我不知道。

不再有谎言！

1634
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:21,670
是的，我知道。我知道。

你母亲坚持要告诉你。
Your mother insisted on telling.

1636

她正准备把这帮人的一大群人，我试图说服她…
She was going to rat the whole gang out, and I tried to convince her...

1637
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,050
汤米，看，我是你的父亲，为了上帝的缘故。
Tommy, look, I'm your father, for God's sake.

1638
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:34,260
你不会杀了你的父亲，汤米。
You don't kill your father, Tommy.

1639

他的名字叫白刀。

1640

我不会杀了你。

1641
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:57,740
因为我的父亲教过我。

1642
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:13,300
你不能这样离开我！
You can't leave me like this!

1643
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:17,260
汤米！
Tommy!

1644
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:21,060
你不能离开我独自在这里！
You can't leave me here alone!

1645
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:58,470
亲爱的妈妈，自从我上一封信以来已经改变了很多。

我几乎不知道从哪里开始。
<i>I scarcely know where to begin.</i>

1647
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:05,770
首先，它证明我们的爸爸是一个坏的，坏男人，
<i>First off, it turns out our daddy is a bad, bad man,</i>

1648

他被扔进监狱。
<i>and he got thrown in jail.</i>

1649

但这是好的，因为尖叫鹰，印度酋长谁提出了汤米，
<i>But it's okay, 'cause Screaming Eagle, the Indian chief who raised Tommy,</i>

1650
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:19,910
说他将是我们的所有的爸爸。

这些白人不能跳舞。

1656
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,480

1657

拉蒙和她正在努力学习印度方式。

我终于有了一个女朋友，

1660

她比很多漂亮活泼的放大镜。
<i>and she's much prettier than a canty-loupe.</i>

1661
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:14,920
加油，你们俩！你错过了所有的乐趣。
Come on, you two! You're missing all the fun.

1662

不管怎么说，妈妈，谢谢你养育我。
