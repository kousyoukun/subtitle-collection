Well, that's some, uh...

00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:50,438
[coughing]

166
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:52,940
No.

167
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:58,821
I've come for a more tangible reason.

168
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:08,373
Tommy, I've been stealing from folks
since I was nine years old...

169
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:14,587
and that's the way I've amassed
a good little fortune.

170
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:18,300
[Sighs] I wanna do something
decent with it.

171
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,220
I want to give it to you, son.

172
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,476
I don't want your money.

173
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:32,146
But maybe you could give...

174
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,609
$50,000 to these nice Injuns
who raised you.

175
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:37,902
We'll take it.

176
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,154
Go back to bed.

177
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:41,781
Sorry.

178
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:43,658
Seriously, though,
we'll take it.

179
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:47,204
Look, it's buried in the meadow
just up the trail,

180
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:49,372
next to a big ol' pine tree.

181
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,833
What do you say
we go dig it up in the morning

182
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,919
and start playing Santa Claus?

183
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:58,673
I don't remember much about my mother...

184
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:02,219
but I do remember her telling me...

185
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:05,638
you were dead.

186
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:08,391
[Clicks tongue]

187
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:10,768
[exhales]

188
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:13,438
Maybe it was because...

189
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:16,858
she didn't want
you to come looking for me.

190
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:19,026
She was a smart lady.

191
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:24,156
Only stupid thing she ever did
was fall for me.

192
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:26,784
Meeting Betty Dunson...

193
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:30,663
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

194
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,086
From the first day I laid eyes on her...

195
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,006
she was bawlin' out this...

196
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:45,011
half-drunk, big ol' burly blacksmith...

197
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:47,639
down at Silver Canyon.

198
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,808
She's been the only one, Tommy.

199
00:12:57,982 --> 00:12:59,526
Mom had a temper?

200
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:05,573
[Chuckling] Temper?
When she got her dander up, look out.

201
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:07,492
We was in a saloon once.

202
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:09,744
This fellow sitting next to her

203
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:14,832
starts talking about the perfect way
to make a cherry pie...

204
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:19,712
So your mom says to me,
"Frank, come here a minute.

205
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:23,550
Tell me again,
just where did you get them flowers?"

206
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:27,679
I said, "I know that you think
I stole them from the graveyard."

207
00:13:27,762 --> 00:13:29,431
[Both chuckling]

208
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,516
Good morning, boys.

209
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,018
Morning, Never Wears Bra.

210
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:36,938
I had dream about you last night,
White Knife.

211
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,856
Oh, that's nice.

212
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,191
Not nice dream.

213
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,403
In dream, you naughty.

214
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,613
You naughty, White Knife.

215
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:47,949
Mmm, somebody's got an admirer.

216
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:50,076
- [Chuckles]
- Yes, yes.

217
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,162
But like you,
there's only one woman for me.

218
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,337
I guess we Stockburns are...

219
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,171
partial to the sweet ones.

220
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:03,631
Yes, sir.

221
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:05,508
Like your mother.

222
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:10,304
How did she die, Tommy?

223
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:12,682
You tell me?

224
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:19,731
Well, there were these big kids at school
fixin' to beat me up.

225
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:25,778
Instead of facing them myself,
I had her walk me there.

226
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,865
This feller comes out of nowhere...

227
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,577
walks right up to her and shoots her dead.

228
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:37,624
So that's how she died,
protecting her gutless son

229
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:41,794
instead of being home,
safe where she belonged.

230

Who's that?
Is that Bony Express?

00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:53,055

don't come around here.

He's here somewhere, boys.

00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:16,996
Next one goes through your forehead.

242

Hey, hey!
No need to burn nothing, boys!

you're not gonna let a man
enjoy his retirement, are ya?

246
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:33,763
No, Frank, I salute your decision
to turn from your sinful ways.

247
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:35,598
But the money...

248
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:37,392
that belongs to all of us.

249
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:38,810
Touch that steel, boy,

250
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:42,063
I got plenty of bullets left over
after I put one in...

Oh, you finally found your long lost son.

254
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:54,409
Well, I sure hate to break up
this nice family reunion.

255
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:57,787
So, why don't you give us
the money you stole

256
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,665
before I put lead in your head.

257
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:07,964
The money's buried.

258
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,257
Way to run your mouth, son.

259
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:11,759
It's buried?

00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:13,595
Yeah, I buried it.

261
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:17,181
Deep in the ground...
next to a windmill.

262
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:19,559
A windmill in the West...

263
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:21,769
doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.

264
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,230
Well, this is a special windmill.

265
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:27,024
It's a singing windmill.

It's about a ten-day ride from here.

I'll lead you to it presently
on one condition.

Frank, if that $50,000
isn't under that windmill,

275
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,229
I'm gonna bury you up to your neck

276
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:07,899
and let the desert critters eat you alive.

277
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:10,359
It's there, Cicero, it's there.

278
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:14,155
I'm glad I got to meet Betty Dunson's son.

279
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:17,324
You just stay here, Tommy.

280
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,744
Enjoy your life
with your beautiful bride...

281
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:24,874
amongst these majestic pine trees.

00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:28,210
Let's go!

283
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,609
Well, that was uncool.

284
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:04,080
White Knife, you must rest.

285
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,623
How can I rest?

286
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:09,376
When they get to the singing windmill
and find no money, they will kill him.

287
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,756
My son, there are too many trees
and too little time.

288
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,427
Then I must get this $50,000 another way.

289
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,431
How? By stealing?
There is no honor in that.

290
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:27,854
Unless I steal from those
who have no honor.

291
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:31,148
Ooh... I like that.

292
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:33,150
But it is too dangerous.

293
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:35,695
I will send ten of our
strongest braves with you.

294
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:37,113
No.

295
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:40,241
The braves would be treated too cruelly
in the white man's world.

296
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:42,534
A lot of them can pass for pale face.

297
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,830
Raging Bear can actually do
a great impression of a white guy.

298
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:49,876
Hey, guys, let's play with our chest hair
and eat potato chips.

299

[All laughing]

300
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,381
Wasn't that great?
Where does he come up with this stuff?

301
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:59,218
That's very good, Bear,
but I must walk this path alone.

302
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:04,140
My love...
I will get this money...

303
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:06,517
bring it to the singing windmill,

304
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,686
and be back in time for our wedding.

305
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,647
I won't let you go.

306
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:12,899
Those men are killers.

307
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,278
I was a coward once
and my mother paid the price.

308
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:21,616
That will not happen to my father.

309
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:40,426

- Good morning.

Where in the hell did you come from?

312
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,766
I'm in a bit of a bind, boys.

313
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:49,644
I rode all the way out here
to pan for gold

314
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,771
and my horse up and died on me.

315
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,355
How'd he die?

316
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,066
Suicide.

317
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:56,943
Drowned himself.

318
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,404
Put his head in the stream
and just kept it there.

319
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,073
Saddest thing you ever seen.

320
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:04,075
It happens.

321
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:07,119
Powers that be don't like to admit it,
but it happens.

322
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:09,371
He looks like an honest white guy.

323
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,207
Hop on.

324
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,125
Much obliged.

325
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,545
[Tommy] Just drop me off
at the nearest town.

326

[Man] Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around.

327
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:27,348
Hear the wondrous effects
of Dr. Chubb's Vita Oil,

328
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:29,809
the miracle cure for 1001 ailments.

329
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,728
Put the pep back in your--

330
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:33,520
Who's this asshole?

331
00:20:34,438 --> 00:20:36,899
[Indistinct chattering]

332
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:51,247
Well, now, look at this fella,
drinking from the horse trough.

333
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,331
Excuse me.

334
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:54,834
You there!

335
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:58,963
What you're doing is disgusting.

336
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:01,382
That water is for our filthy horses.

337
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:05,762
Water flows from the sky spirit
for all its children.

338
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:07,054
Isn't that right, cousin?

339
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:11,100
We don't cotton to that peyote-smoking
nonsense around these parts.

340
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:13,144
Do you hear me, "cousin"?

341
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:17,481
[Chuckling] Okay, William, come on back.

342
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,025
Hey, <i>amigo.</i>

343
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,652
You planning on staying in town?

344
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,114
Might need a place
to lay my head for a bit.

345
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:36,333
Sorry about that ugly man
that insulted you.

346
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:40,546
He runs the bank, so he thinks
he's entitled to be mean to everyone.

347
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:42,506
There's a bank in this town?

348
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,300
Why? You wanna rob it?

349
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:47,594
I look like a bank robber to you, ma'am?

350
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:52,599
Funny, there's something about you that
reminds me of a certain bank robber.

351
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:55,144
His name was Frank Stockburn.

352
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,605
You know Frank Stockburn?

353
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,775
"Know"? Like, in the biblical sense?

354
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:04,278
No, ma'am.
You've met him before is what I'm asking.

355
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:06,738
Yes, I met him.

356
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,282
Then, 20 minutes later,

357
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:11,828
I knew him in the biblical sense
on that bed, right there.

358
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:12,912
Oh.

359
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:17,875
And, I knew him, in the biblical sense,
twice on this railing.

360
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:18,960
Uh-huh.

361
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:23,380
And then, while doing a handstand
on that dresser you're leaning against.

362
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:29,178
Did he happen to mention
a singing windmill?

363
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:32,098
He did mention a singing windmill.

364
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:35,059
He said it sounded like a choir of angels.

365
00:22:35,142 --> 00:22:36,853
Where'd he say it was?

366
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:41,941
He said that it was in a place
where he made his biggest score.

367
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,068
Whatever that was.

368
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,402
And then he laughed.

369
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:47,696
He liked to laugh...

370
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:49,781
and have handstand sex.

371
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,742
Yeah, we gotta get past that.

372
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:53,077
I miss him.

373
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,121
But he did leave me something
to remember him by.

374
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:56,580
What's this?

375
00:22:56,663 --> 00:23:00,084
A <i>niño,</i> Ramon.

376
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:03,295
I have a brother?

377
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,341
Oh, Burro, we had many adventures
together, you and me.

378
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:08,926
We're not getting any younger.

379
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,302
[Chuckles]

380
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:13,097
At least we have our memories.

[Laughing]

382
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:18,895
Remember the two girls,
the sisters, in Deadwood?

383
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:20,271
You liked the fat one.

384
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:21,939
[Laughing]

385
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:23,607
You know it's true.

386
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,192
[Tommy] Ramon Lopez?

387
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:27,528
<i>Sí.</i>

388
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:33,325
I just came from conversating
with your mother, Esmerelda.

389
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:38,330
We stumbled upon the fact that
your dad and my dad...

390
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:41,667
are the same fella.

391
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,835
Oh, that's neat.

392
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:45,587
Yeah.

393
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:47,881
Same father.

394
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:50,051
Half-brothers.

395
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:52,094
What do you think about that, Burro?

396
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,806
So, how is Dad?

397
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:58,976
Well, he went and got himself kidnapped,

398
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,896
and I need to come up with $50,000
to save his life.

399
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:05,357
That's a lot of pesos.

400
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:06,567
Sure is.

401
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:10,862
That's why I'm fixin'
to rob the bank here in town.

402
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,199
Hang on.

403
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:16,868
My father is in trouble.

404

My brother, he needs my help.

405

I'll rob the bank with you.

406

I must do this alone.

one magical day with <i>mi padre,</i>

sharing meals,
introducing him to the burro.

I will not let go of you
until you say I can help you.

Will you stop brushing me
if I say yes?

Yes.

414

00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:08,827
[Crowd screaming]

487
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:12,914
Taste my bullets,
you dirty foreigners!

488
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:14,458
Now!

489
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,256
- Nice one, Burro.
- Wow!

490
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:21,632
- There they are!
- [Ramon] We better make tracks.

491
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:23,217
Can I come with?
I got a wagon.

492
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,176
All right, that ain't a bad idea,
let's go.

493
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:26,762
[Ramon] <i>Vámonos.</i> Come on!

494
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:29,515
[Lil Pete] So, if you guys are
my brothers,

495
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:31,350
you must got three nipples, too.

496
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:32,643
[Ramon] I only got two.

497
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:34,270
[Tommy] Yeah, just got the two.

498
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:36,563
[Lil Pete] Oh, must be
from my mama's side.

499
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,524
Forget I tolded you that, okay?

500
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:39,691
[Tommy] Will do.

501
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:42,986
[Will Patch] Are you ready, Clem?

502
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:46,573
[Clem] Yep, yep. I'm... I'm ready.

503
00:29:52,746 --> 00:29:53,955
Spoon.

504
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:57,000
Damn sharp.

505
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:08,094
Look, fellas, I wanna hunt
this white Injun down same as you.

506
00:30:08,178 --> 00:30:09,930
But, uh... I...

507
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:13,267
I have some problems with my eyes.

508
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,354
You wanna join the Left-Eye Gang,
that right eye has gotta come out.

509
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:19,440
It'll only hurt for a second.

510
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:22,108
Yeah, like a hundred seconds.

511
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:25,070
- Then you're one of us.
- For life.

512
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,114
Okay, that makes sense.

513
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:33,912
Is it okay if I scoop this left eye out?

514
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:35,747
This is... I'm basically blind here.

515
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,999
This right one sees like an eagle.

516
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:41,002
Yeah, it just seems
like a waste that I'd...

517
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:44,423
I understand your predicament,
but rules is rules.

518
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:47,008
Yeah, guess it... makes sense.

519
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:50,971
[Breathing heavily]

520
00:30:52,473 --> 00:30:53,932
Oh, God!

521
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:56,393
- [Clem grunting]
- [Gus Patch] Hell, no!

522
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:59,187
That ain't right!

523
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:01,607
- [Grunts]
- [Gus Patch] Damn!

524
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,024
[Will Patch] It's half way.

525
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:04,901
- It's dangling by a vein!
- [Clem] Whoo! Oh, man!

526
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:07,278
It's crazy,
I can still see out of it!

527
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:08,780
- Goddamn, it hurts!
- I think I'm gonna puke.

528
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:12,158
It's just going round and round like
a tassel on a stripper's titty!

529
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:13,827
Okay, gotta get it, gotta get it!

530
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,454
I'm getting dizzy!

531
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:17,205
Got it, got it, got it!

532
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:18,289
Yeah!

533
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:20,083
[Groaning] Ah!

534
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,044
Oh, Lord! Holy shit.

535
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:27,924
You done it, partner.
Welcome to the Left-Eye Gang.

536
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:29,050
Whoo!

537
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:30,386
I did it!

538
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:33,555
[Laughing] I'm glad that's done.

539
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:36,517
Let's just go get that
Injun-loving son of a bitch, huh?

540
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,643
Yeah.

541
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:39,811
- Yeah! Let's get him.
- Yeah.

542
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:42,105
Like, so...

543
00:31:42,188 --> 00:31:44,274
Oh, I touched the hole.
I touched the hole!

544
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:49,154
Got me a patch! [Chuckles]

Yeah, Lil Pete?

00:34:14,174 --> 00:34:16,092
Where's the singing windmill?

583
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:18,720
It's where dad made
his biggest score.

584
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:22,891
Maybe we'll get another clue
up at Jawbone Falls.

585
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:26,394
That's where he used to hide out
when he was an outlaw.

Yeah, Lil Pete?

589
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:39,490
If we get caught stealing...

590
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:41,868
would we be in trouble?

591
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,456
I reckon we'll hang.

00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:52,378
Well... that's no bother.

593

I got a real strong neck.

Mama makes me pull the plow with my head
if I don't finish my schoolwork.

[Chuckling] Which occurs regularilly.

596
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,810
Strong neck might come in handy.

Okay, let's get our rest.

[Ramon] Oh, come on, fly, <i>vámonos!</i>
We need our sleep.

[Tommy] Let me take care of this.

613
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,113
[Ramon] How can you see a fly in the dark?

614
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:03,449
[Tommy] A true hunter sees
with all his senses.

615

[Buzzing stops]

616

[Lil Pete] Uh-oh.

I think you just nicked his biscuits off.

620
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,216
[Tommy] That's what I was aiming for.

621
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:22,969
He didn't deserve to die.

622
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:26,556
He deserved to know
he was not welcome here.

623
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,517
[Ramon] Raised by Indians, huh?

624
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,687
That had some impact on you.

625

[Fly buzzing]

626
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,733

- [horse neighing]

629
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:46,827
[Ramon] Sounded like a horse fly.

630
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,705
That wasn't a horse fly,
that was my horse!

631
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:51,247
Peanut?

632
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:53,124
Oh, Peanut!

633
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:57,420
[Ramon] Oh, the burro's gonna be pissed.

634
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:00,173
[Ramon] You're doing <i>bueno,</i> Burro!

635
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:03,134
Don't be intimidated by the horse,
you're just as good as him.

636
00:37:03,218 --> 00:37:05,136
[Lil Pete] I'm so hungry.

637
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,347
[Tommy] There's breakfast all around.

638
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,227
Nuts, berries, bark,
different kinds of mud.

639
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,479
I wish there were taco trees.

640
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:16,022
What's a taco?

641
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:17,523
They're the best.

642
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,236
Meat and cheese and tomatoes
in a crispy shell.

643
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:22,738
You'd love it, man.

644

Mr. Stockburn and I

was actually black.

Strike three!
You're out!

1109
01:04:20,061 --> 01:04:24,190
No, no, the ball was... too low.

1110
01:04:24,273 --> 01:04:29,321
In order for it to count as a strike,
it has to pass through the...

1111
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,655
strike zone.

- Strike zone?
- That's right.

1113
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,911
And if you don't get the ball past me,
between my knees and my titties,

1114
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:38,162
it's not a strike.

[Stammering] It's a non-strike.

And if you throw me four non-strikes,

1117
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:44,586
I get an express ticket to first base
without my even hitting it.

1122
01:05:06,941 --> 01:05:08,192
Where you going?
Nobody hit it.

1123
01:05:08,276 --> 01:05:11,488
I stole the base.
You weren't looking, so I stole it.

1124
01:05:11,571 --> 01:05:14,699
You said you could only advance
after you hit the ball!

1125
01:05:14,783 --> 01:05:16,993
Not when you're stealing.

1126
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:18,703
That's bullshit.

1127
01:05:18,787 --> 01:05:20,038
Okay, Short Stop.

1128
01:05:37,889 --> 01:05:38,973
[Chico] He's moving!

1129
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,644
Safe!

1130

[Cheering]

1131
01:05:49,693 --> 01:05:50,694
Gall dang, I don't know.

1132
01:05:50,777 --> 01:05:53,780
- That was a tie.
- Yes, and tie goes to the runner!

1133
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:55,449
Why's that?

1134
01:05:55,532 --> 01:05:59,869
Because those are the rules
of Stickie McSchnickens, that's why.

1135
01:06:02,956 --> 01:06:04,624
All right, it's all mine,
I've got it!

1136
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:07,919
No! No, you can't run.
You cannot run.

1137
01:06:08,002 --> 01:06:11,923
Infield fly rule... in full effect.

1138

[Speaking Spanish]

1139
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:15,719
You're out.

1140
01:06:17,596 --> 01:06:19,180
- Here we go, Herm.
- [Ramon] Okay, Herm!

1141
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,306
[Lil Pete] Yeah.

1142
01:06:23,184 --> 01:06:24,393
[Grunts]

1143
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,605
[Ramon] Oh!

1144
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:28,482
Oh, I'm not getting that.

1145
01:06:28,565 --> 01:06:29,691
[Ramon] Yeah, <i>bueno!</i>

1146
01:06:29,774 --> 01:06:33,778
You can just run all the way home.
A home runner.

1147
01:06:35,196 --> 01:06:36,906
I need a cold drink.

1148
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:40,702
Let's take a five-minute stretch
and then start the second half.

1149
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:42,496
Mr. Doubleday, we're done.

1150
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:44,623
But we've only played nine innings.

1151
01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:48,460
Nine innings is enough.
Tell us about Dad's biggest score.

1152
01:06:48,543 --> 01:06:50,128
Fine.

1153
01:06:50,211 --> 01:06:56,593
Your father and his gang knocked off
an entire cavalry regiment, 120 men,

1154
01:06:56,676 --> 01:06:59,137
five trunks filled with Yankee money.

1155
01:07:00,472 --> 01:07:01,598
Where'd that happen?

1156
01:07:01,681 --> 01:07:04,601
Up at Sweet Hog Rock...

1157
01:07:04,684 --> 01:07:06,561
100 miles due north.

1158
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:08,396
You'll know it when you see it.

1159
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,231
Well, fellas,

1160
01:07:10,314 --> 01:07:14,318
looks like we're going to Sweet Hog Rock
to find ourselves a singing windmill.

1161
01:07:14,402 --> 01:07:16,112
But we still need another 10,000 bucks.

1162
01:07:16,195 --> 01:07:18,532
I reckon we'll make a quick stop, then.

1163
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:20,366
Before you go...

1164
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:23,411
do you wanna line up and shake hands
and say "good game" to each other?

1165
01:07:24,037 --> 01:07:25,038
No.

1166
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:28,542
{\An8}Them boys were nice fellers.

1167
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:31,920
{\An8}Paid in cash.
Kept the profanity to a minimum.

1168
01:07:32,003 --> 01:07:35,924
And the Mexican brother knocked
this hard-ass' head off with a shovel?

1169
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:39,761
Dang thing flew nearly 40 feet!
And still a-smilin'.

1170
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:40,845
Oh! Man!

1171
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:43,347
And hasn't stopped yet.

1172

[Chuckles]

1173
01:07:47,185 --> 01:07:52,106
Oh, hell, no!
My man gluing on heads and shit!

1174
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,693
Wish he'd glue the head back on my pecker.

1175
01:07:54,776 --> 01:07:56,235
What happened to your pecker?

1176
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:59,573
I was part of another gang
before I joined up with y'all.

1177
01:07:59,656 --> 01:08:00,740
Texas Stubbies.

1178

[Stammering] Okay,
never mind all that. Okay?

1179
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,790
Now, Doc, you know which way
them there Ridiculous 6 rode off to?

1180
01:08:08,873 --> 01:08:11,459
We're traveling
with a friend of theirs who, uh...

1181
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:13,628
- will be real excited to see them.
- [Snickering]

1182
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:16,089
Well, they headed up north
to the Turquoise Trail.

1183
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:18,800
I can show you on the map over here.

1184
01:08:20,885 --> 01:08:23,638
Looking forward to seeing
your man beg for his life?

1185
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:24,764
[Clem chuckles]

1186

'Cause that's what's gonna happen,
Smoking Fox.

Chicken pox! [Laughs]

1188
01:08:29,769 --> 01:08:32,689
We're gaining on his
Injun-loving ass every day.

1189
01:08:32,772 --> 01:08:34,315
He messed with the Left-Eye Gang!

1190
01:08:34,398 --> 01:08:35,567
He's gonna be like,

1191
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:42,240
"Wait, how did you find me, and where...
How did you get my girl?" [Laughs]

1192
01:08:42,323 --> 01:08:46,452
And then old Dumb Knife's gonna realize
that he's in way over his head.

[Laughing and imitating gunshots]

Excuse me, Sheriff.

1197
01:09:12,854 --> 01:09:14,648
Is there a church in this town?

1198
01:09:14,731 --> 01:09:17,901
This is Rattler's Gulch, you halfwit.

1199
01:09:17,984 --> 01:09:21,738
The meanest, crookedest,
most hellacious town in the West.

1200
01:09:21,821 --> 01:09:25,408
We don't need no preacher telling us
what we can and cannot do.

1201
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:28,244
So it's all right
if I do this to your wife?

01:13:17,473 --> 01:13:19,808
Rusty, no, come back!

1280
01:13:19,893 --> 01:13:20,935
[Mouthing] No.

[eagle screeching]

1283
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:36,868
How are we gonna save him?
We're startin' all over.

1284
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:39,287
Is there any more good places
we can rob?

1285
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:43,082
You know like a burro-grooming place
or a shoe store for burros?

1286
01:13:43,749 --> 01:13:46,502
Half the lawmen in the West
are already looking for us.

1287
01:13:46,585 --> 01:13:49,255
So what?
Look, we can't stop.

1288
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:50,589
They're going to kill him!

1289
01:13:50,673 --> 01:13:53,051
Ain't no difference.
He's dying anyways.

1290
01:13:57,096 --> 01:13:58,764
Dad's sick.

1291
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:01,559
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all.

1292
01:14:02,435 --> 01:14:04,896
There's a good chance
he's dead already.

1293
01:14:07,731 --> 01:14:11,610
But there's a chance he's not.
You got to meet him, Tommy.

1294
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:13,612
The rest of us...

1295
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:16,199
Even if it was just for five minutes,
it'd be worth it.

1296
01:14:16,282 --> 01:14:22,080
If I don't talk to Dad, I'll die with this
dirty secret burnin' a hole in my guts.

1297
01:14:22,163 --> 01:14:26,834
Danito, whatever it is you did,
you have to forgive yourself, man.

1298
01:14:26,918 --> 01:14:29,253
You wouldn't say that if you know
what I done.

1299
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:31,797
- Everybody's got secrets, Danny.
- [Ramon] Yeah.

1300
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,258
You guys are the first people
I told I was black.

1301
01:14:34,342 --> 01:14:36,802
You know how good that made me feel?

1302
01:14:36,885 --> 01:14:38,972
We're your brothers.

1303
01:14:39,055 --> 01:14:41,057
You can tell us anything.

1304

[sighs]

1306
01:14:47,271 --> 01:14:50,024

One of the best.

01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:58,866

[indistinct talking]

1312

Mr. President, say, I'm gonna go
hit the little boys' room.

1313
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:09,502
Are you shitting me?

1314
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:11,837
Come on!
You'll be fine, superstar.

1315

Can I get ya something on the way back?

No!

Mrs. Lincoln, how about one of them
big pretzels or a little pillow?

1318
01:15:19,762 --> 01:15:21,680
I hear this play's kind of a long one.

1319
01:15:22,806 --> 01:15:25,309
All right, fair enough.
I'll be back in two.

Where's the president's box?

1322
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,988
- John Wilkes Booth, the actor?
- Yeah.

1323
01:15:37,071 --> 01:15:39,823
No way, man! Big fan!

1324
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:41,742
- You wanna say hi to the president?
- Yeah.

1325
01:15:41,825 --> 01:15:44,453
He'd get a real kick out of that.
Last door on the left.

That's what I wanna ask Dad.

Hey, you ain't the one
who pulled that trigger.

1333
01:16:12,898 --> 01:16:15,859
But if Dad's gotta be
the one who tells you that...

then let's go get that money.

to the General here about my new book.

- It's a sequel to <i>Tom Sawyer.</i>

It's about Sawyer's home slice,

And, General Custer, I see you've let
your dashing blond hair grow out.

1377
01:18:33,622 --> 01:18:36,792
Well, yes, the barber down at
the regiment is just awful,

1378
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:40,546
so I had two choices,
either let it grow or get scalped.

- And I ain't gonna let that happen.

Gentlemen, the buy-in is $15,000.

Fifteen large?

1406

Are you sure General Custard
can swing that?

1407
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:05,506
It's Custer, not "Custard."
There is no "D." I'm not a dessert.

1408
01:20:05,589 --> 01:20:08,426
Boom, I just dropped some satire
on your ass, General!

You got me!

1411

Hey! Now, when Ramon gives
the signal that the time is right,

1412
01:20:15,308 --> 01:20:16,725
that's when we move in.

You remember the signal, right?

1414

Oh, hell, no!

1416
01:20:28,696 --> 01:20:30,531
That's Wyatt Earp!

1417
01:20:30,614 --> 01:20:32,950
The fastest gun in the West?

1418

All right, all right, all right!

1419
01:20:37,037 --> 01:20:40,416

out there robbing everybody blind.

Oh, they call themselves
the Ridiculous 6.

five miles in this territory

worry about the Injuns?

Hey, I'm good on anything.
Just like gravy, baby.

1431
01:21:08,777 --> 01:21:10,571
- Good to see you, my man.
- You too, man.

1432
01:21:10,654 --> 01:21:13,324
Hey! I finally read <i>Prince and the Pauper.</i>

1433
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:14,658
Oh, is that right?

1434
01:21:14,742 --> 01:21:15,993
Didn't get it.

1435
01:21:16,994 --> 01:21:18,078
For reals?

1436
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:22,082
- Satire! Boom! I got ya!
- [All laughing]

- Oh, man.

I can't read.

1439

Good one with the... satire.

1440
01:21:31,925 --> 01:21:33,677
[Laughs] Funny.

Who's this idiot?

1442
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:41,560
Um... I am Don...

01:21:41,644 --> 01:21:43,270
Don Don Diego.

1444
01:21:44,605 --> 01:21:46,607
Well, Don, I'm Wyatt...

1445
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,900
Wyatt Wyatt Earp.

[In sing-song voice] Now let's play
some cards!

Let's get inside before this Wyatt Earp
ruins our plan.

1460
01:22:25,896 --> 01:22:28,315
But there's no way for you to sneak
past them guys, Tommy.

1461
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,652
There's no rocks, no trees,
no nothing to hide behind.

1462
01:22:31,735 --> 01:22:36,198
No need to hide, brother,
when you are friends with the wind.

1463
01:22:36,281 --> 01:22:38,992
I'm telling you, down there,
they don't call it "Mexico."

1464
01:22:39,076 --> 01:22:44,206
It's "Mehico." The "X" is an "H."
I'm presuming Texas is "Tehas."

1465
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:48,085
Now, what's this?

1466
01:22:48,168 --> 01:22:50,713
Just a tumbleweed,
you jumpy bastard.

[Tommy speaking gibberish]

That is some mystical shit.

[Piano music playing]

1470
01:23:13,652 --> 01:23:17,698
I wish to move the dresser
in my bedroom closer to the window,

1471
01:23:17,781 --> 01:23:21,034
but I haven't the strength
to do it myself.

1472
01:23:21,118 --> 01:23:24,872
I'd love to help, ma'am, but I really
should keep playing the piano.

[Lever squeaks]

[Exclaiming]

- Gentlemen, cough up your buy-ins.
- All right!

1477
01:23:37,885 --> 01:23:39,177
Make it rain like Twain.

1478
01:23:39,261 --> 01:23:40,971
[General Custer] Take that and that.
[Mark] Yeah!

1479
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:44,266
Sure is some good hooch there, Zeke.
Where'd you find that?

1480
01:23:44,349 --> 01:23:48,812
Oh, I got that from a case
about, uh, 20 years ago.

1481
01:23:48,896 --> 01:23:52,357
In fact, uh, you know that shack
up by Jawbone Falls?

1482
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,985
- Yeah.
- There was a lady living there.

1483
01:23:55,068 --> 01:23:57,655
It was one of Frank Stockburn's
many paramours.

1484
01:23:57,738 --> 01:24:02,409
Now this was one of the ugliest ladies
I've ever seen in my life.

1485
01:24:02,493 --> 01:24:04,452
Sounds like a real bucket of turds.

1486
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:08,624
But she was a very talented
distiller of alcohol.

1487
01:24:08,707 --> 01:24:11,126
[Chucking] So, while she--

1488
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:14,588
While she's loading up my coach,
her young boy comes out,

1489
01:24:14,672 --> 01:24:20,218
this big shambling oaf,
mute, filthy as a hog,

1490
01:24:20,302 --> 01:24:23,722
and he starts doing
this horrible little tap dance

1491
01:24:23,806 --> 01:24:26,767
whilst singing "The Star-Spangled Banner."

1492
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:30,145
Well, not singing it, really,
but grunting it, like a caveman!

[Grunting]

[Laughing]

1495
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:36,819
You know,
he wants me to throw him some pennies,

1496
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:38,862
so I fished a coin out of my pocket

1497
01:24:38,946 --> 01:24:40,948
and I guess I don't know my own strength.

1498
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:44,660
I tossed it, hit him in the mouth,
and knocked his tooth out!

1499
01:24:44,743 --> 01:24:46,912
[Laughing]

1500
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:48,413

[Mumbles] Mama.

1502

In any event, I still have
one bottle left from that case.

1503
01:24:55,921 --> 01:25:00,551
I'll go fetch it and we can drink a toast
to that awful woman and her hideous son.

Oh, she was ugly!
You wouldn't even sleep with her.

where's your buy-in?

1508
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:15,482
I thought it was 15 grand a man.

- Yeah.

What "what"?

1519
01:25:58,692 --> 01:26:00,568
What are you so surprised about?

1520
01:26:00,653 --> 01:26:05,407
Just so surprised at all the...
the fun that we're having here,

1521
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,785
with the card and the money
and the booze and...

1522
01:26:09,953 --> 01:26:13,040
You know, I make that same face when
I put my cologne on in the morning,

1523
01:26:13,123 --> 01:26:15,208
especially when I'm home alone.

You know what I think?

1525
01:26:16,627 --> 01:26:20,338
I think Don Don Diego isn't really
a coffee bean rancher at all.

1526
01:26:20,422 --> 01:26:24,092
And his true purpose here is to rob us.

Don't make me kill you, Mr. Earp.

[Tommy] Yeah, I think we found it.

That is one sweet hog right there.

That is a sweet, majestic hog.

Yeah, that's a sweet one for sure.

It's all right.

1547

I'm confused.
I don't see a hog or a pig anywhere.

- Yeah. Okay.

1552
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:06,444
Problem is, I don't see

Oh, it's just these assholes.

What the hell happened to you guys?

1563
01:28:30,803 --> 01:28:37,184
[Spits] We was headed west to Frisco
after we absconded with your loot.

[Chuckles and spits]

1565
01:28:39,269 --> 01:28:41,814
But we ran into these real bad characters.

1566
01:28:41,897 --> 01:28:45,525
It was Cicero something
and his crazy-ass gang.

[Screams]

1568

Cicero was here?
Then he left?

He left us in the dirt for fun.

- [crow caws]
- [crying]

1574
01:29:00,582 --> 01:29:03,794
If this is where the singing windmill is,
then why would they just up and leave?

1575
01:29:03,877 --> 01:29:07,297
Maybe that Stickie McSchnickens guy
was just pulling our leg.

1576
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,592
They went north...
about two hours ago.

1577
01:29:10,675 --> 01:29:11,885
Oh, yeah! Tommy can track 'em.

1578

Let's saddle up.
We're burning daylight.

1579

[Left-Eye Boys] Wait!

1580
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:17,557
[Will Patch] You can't just leave us here,
you gotta get us out!

- Yeah.

1738
01:38:51,255 --> 01:38:53,007
Do you like to play with the extra one?

1739
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:54,551
Oh, you betcha.

1740
01:38:54,634 --> 01:38:57,219
Oh, Pa, I have a question for you.

1741
01:38:57,303 --> 01:38:58,721
Yeah.

1742
01:38:58,805 --> 01:39:01,724
Where do babies come from?

1743
01:39:01,808 --> 01:39:05,437
Well, son, the mom just poops 'em out.

1744
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,981
[Laughing] I knewed it!
I knewed it, Dad!

1745
01:39:10,483 --> 01:39:12,777
Well, look at this handsome devil.

1746
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:15,321
Sir, I'm Danny.

1747
01:39:15,404 --> 01:39:17,449
It's awful nice to finally meet ya.

1748
01:39:17,532 --> 01:39:20,076
Could you help me with a problem?

1749
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,119
I did a real stupid thing

1750
01:39:22,203 --> 01:39:26,791
that inadvertently led to the death
of a United States President,

1751
01:39:26,874 --> 01:39:30,920
and I'm feeling pretty lousy about it.

1752
01:39:32,589 --> 01:39:34,924
Well, son...

1753
01:39:35,007 --> 01:39:36,468
look in my eyes.

1754
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:40,638
Shit happens.

1755
01:39:41,931 --> 01:39:43,683
Yeah.

1756
01:39:43,766 --> 01:39:46,018
- Yeah, right.
- [Both chuckling]

1757
01:39:46,102 --> 01:39:48,395
Thanks. Thank you, sir.

1758
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,856
- [Frank] You're welcome.
- [Exhales]

1759
01:39:49,939 --> 01:39:53,067
So, where to now, huh?

1760
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:56,696
Well, sir, Smoking Fox and me
are getting married in a few days,

1761
01:39:56,779 --> 01:40:00,032
and Screaming Eagle's
walking her down the aisle,

1762
01:40:00,116 --> 01:40:03,285
and I was hoping...

1763
01:40:03,369 --> 01:40:05,747
you could be there, next to me.

1764
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:08,541
Oh, you mean your best man?

1765
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:10,042
Yes, sir.

1766
01:40:10,126 --> 01:40:11,919
Oh, Tommy...

1767
01:40:12,003 --> 01:40:14,631
You know, that's...
that's quite an honor.

1768
01:40:14,714 --> 01:40:17,258
- It would be my honor, sir.
- Yeah. Well, uh...

1769
01:40:18,843 --> 01:40:20,344
[clicks tongue]

1770
01:40:20,427 --> 01:40:23,430
But unfortunately, I...

1771
01:40:23,515 --> 01:40:26,893
I got some business up north
that I gotta attend to.

1772
01:40:26,976 --> 01:40:30,021
I gotta collect some gambling debts and...

1773
01:40:30,104 --> 01:40:33,816
You know,
just to pay the doctors and such.

1774
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:37,361
Say, Dad. You don't ever gotta worry
about money ever again.

1775
01:40:37,444 --> 01:40:40,156
We had to conjure up 50 grand twice!

1776
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:42,199
So we ended up with 100!

1777
01:40:43,325 --> 01:40:44,536
- A hundred?
- [Tommy] Yes, sir.

1778
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:46,829
There's another 50 grand?

1779
01:40:46,913 --> 01:40:48,665
Yes, sir.

1780
01:40:48,748 --> 01:40:51,584
Right here,
in the burro's saddlebag.

1781
01:40:52,126 --> 01:40:56,798
So that business can wait up north,
can't it... best man?

1782
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,679
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I should change my plans.

1783
01:41:02,762 --> 01:41:05,431
<i>- Bueno. Bueno.</i> [Laughs]
- [Frank] Yeah. [Whistles]

1784
01:41:06,223 --> 01:41:07,809
[men shouting indistinctly]

1785
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:13,105
Hey! What are they doing back?

1786
01:41:19,278 --> 01:41:20,780
What is this?

1787
01:41:21,698 --> 01:41:24,450
I guess it's time you kids

1788
01:41:24,533 --> 01:41:29,163
learned the truth
about your dear old dad, huh?

1789
01:41:29,246 --> 01:41:32,709
I'm just too famous.

1790
01:41:32,792 --> 01:41:35,920
I can't walk into any town
west of the Rockies

1791
01:41:36,003 --> 01:41:38,756
without someone calling the law.

1792
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:43,219
So, I came up with a way
we could make 50 grand

1793
01:41:43,302 --> 01:41:45,387
without lifting a finger. [Chuckles]

1794
01:41:45,471 --> 01:41:49,350
And you rascals brought us double!

1795
01:41:49,433 --> 01:41:51,769
Are these my kids or what?

1796
01:41:51,853 --> 01:41:52,979
[Laughing]

1797
01:41:53,062 --> 01:41:54,313
Son of a bitch!

1798
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:58,275
If our two gangs joined forces,

1799
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:02,279
there's not a lawman in the West
that would stand up against us.

1800
01:42:02,363 --> 01:42:05,116
What makes you think we'd turn
to a life of crime?

1801
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,118
'Cause it's in your blood.

1802
01:42:07,201 --> 01:42:09,161
Answer me something.

1803
01:42:09,245 --> 01:42:14,792
Were you ever great at anything
in your life besides stealing?

1804
01:42:16,628 --> 01:42:18,170
No. No.

1805
01:42:18,254 --> 01:42:22,091
You apples didn't fall far from this tree.

1806
01:42:22,174 --> 01:42:24,510
Don't deny who you are.

1807
01:42:24,593 --> 01:42:27,263
If you knew who we really were,

1808
01:42:27,346 --> 01:42:29,974
you'd be very scared right now.

1809
01:42:32,559 --> 01:42:35,187
Don't overplay your hand, son.

1810
01:42:36,773 --> 01:42:39,025
I'm still holding an ace.

1811
01:42:39,859 --> 01:42:40,860
[Woman whimpering]

1812
01:42:48,409 --> 01:42:50,577
I found her. I--

1813
01:42:50,662 --> 01:42:52,121
I told you I'd find her.

1814
01:42:56,417 --> 01:43:00,922
This little beauty stumbled into our camp
a few days ago.

1815
01:43:01,756 --> 01:43:03,507
[Chuckling]

1816
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:06,093
She actually tried to rescue me.

1817
01:43:06,177 --> 01:43:11,057
I'm guessing this means you don't want
me to be your best man no more, huh?

1818
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:13,893
[All laughing]

1819
01:43:13,976 --> 01:43:17,021
Well, I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

1820
01:43:18,314 --> 01:43:24,486
Hand over the other 50 grand...
in that stupid ass' saddlebag,

1821
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:29,909
or I put a bullet
in her pretty Apache head.

1822
01:43:32,829 --> 01:43:34,080
That ain't gonna happen.

1823
01:43:34,789 --> 01:43:36,123
Oh, it ain't?

1824
01:43:36,207 --> 01:43:37,499
No, sir.

1825
01:43:38,459 --> 01:43:39,711
Why's that?

1826
01:43:39,794 --> 01:43:42,671
Mmm... kind of a secret.

1827
01:43:42,755 --> 01:43:46,843
Well, you can tell your old man,
can't ya?

1828
01:43:46,926 --> 01:43:48,260
[Snickers]

1829
01:43:49,804 --> 01:43:51,764

- your boy's holding?
- Uh-huh.

1831
01:43:54,934 --> 01:43:56,728
It was meant for Cicero.

1832
01:43:56,811 --> 01:43:59,814
So there's something special in there.

1833
01:43:59,897 --> 01:44:02,358
- Plan B.
- Plan B?

1834

[Garbled] Plan B.

1835
