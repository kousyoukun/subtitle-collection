- [dog whimpers]

8
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,957
Lookie here.

9
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,669
My day is made. [laughs]

10
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:16,714
I didn't even finish breakfast
and I get to kill me a stinkin' Injun.

11
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:19,133
Injun?

12
00:01:20,217 --> 00:01:21,635
Nah.

13
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,347
I just dress like this so's I don't get
scalped out on the prairie.

14
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,475
Oh, well, that's a convincing outfit.

15
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:31,938
Yeah, you can't be too safe out there...

16
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:34,565
with all of them savages runnin' around.

17
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:36,442
So, what can I do you for?

18
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:39,737
Need some flour.
Five sacks.

19
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:43,074
And a carrot with peanut butter on it.

20
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:44,659
Now, what's that gonna run me?

21
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:47,662
Well, sack of flour's 45 cents.

22
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,997
So, five sacks...

23
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,042
is 40...

24
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,836
Wanna get back to me on that?

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,879
Yeah, look...

26
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:58,589
Now, the flour's in the basement.

27
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:00,883
You can fetch it yourself.

28
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,009
Much obliged.

29
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,989
Well, lookie what we got here.

30
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:27,326
Sweet piece of red prairie meat
out all by her lonesome.

31
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:32,039
- What do you make of that, Nelly?
- Oh, I think she's waiting on you, Will.

32
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:34,666
[laughing and jeering]

33
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:37,628
[Nelly Patch] Go on, get on it.
[man 1] It's on now.

34
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,005
[man 2] Yeah.
[Nelly Patch] Go get her, Will.

35
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:40,089
[man 1] Oh, oh, oh.

36
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,423
[Nelly Patch] Here we go.

37
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:47,764
Now, you must be wondering why five badass
<i>hombres</i> with perfect jawlines...

38
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,978
all sport the same stylish eye patch.

39
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,022
Not my business.

40
00:02:56,105 --> 00:03:00,567
[laughs] We all carved our eyeballs
out our skull

41
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:04,113
to show how devoted
we are to this gang.

42
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:05,447
We the Left-Eye Boys!

43

[men cheering]

44
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:09,076
- Yeah!
- [woman screams]

45
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:11,745
Hey!

46
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,623
You got real pretty eyes, miss.

47
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,834
You reckon we can,
I don't know, borrow one?

48
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:18,920
- [screaming]
- Can we borrow one?

49
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,760
Now, is that a proper question
to ask a lady?

50
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:29,889
Who are you, slick?
The boyfriend?

51
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:31,057
[laughing]

52
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,184
Soon to be the husband.

53
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,144
[Will Patch scoffs]

54
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:38,522
Oh, wait a minute!
That's a white boy under that getup.

55
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,400
That's a white boy? Oh, shit.

56
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:44,695
You partial to pale faces, Poca-hot-tits?

57
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:45,780
- Huh?
- [laughing]

58
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:48,324
'Cause I can show you
what a real white man's like.

59
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:51,786
- Yeah, show her, Will. Yeah, go on.
- Yeah, shuffle up, Will.

60
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:53,287
- Dance now, boy.
- Shuffle on over.

61
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,040
- There you go.
- That's some white boy shit right there.

62
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:57,875
Now, I do want to carve my eyes out.

63
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,501
- What'd you say?
- Hey, fellers...

64
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,546
I'd hit the trail before you get hurt.

65
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:05,424
[snickering] Before we get hurt?

66
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:08,094
- Before we get hurt.
- [laughing]

67
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:12,139
I think you've been smokin' too much
of that peace pipe, kemo-slobby.

68
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:15,684
- [Left-Eye Boys laughing]
- Now, from what I see, there's one of you,

69
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:18,104
and there's five of us.

70
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:24,944
Four of you.

71
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:26,778
What just happened?

72
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:28,155
You wanna see it again?

73
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:30,992
Uh... yes.

74
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,746
[screaming]

75
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:37,539
[grunts]

76
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:44,380
- I don't like this shit.
- Shut up.

77
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:48,592
Well, that's some, uh...
real fancy footwork.

78
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:53,430
But I think this hullabaloo has escalated
to the firearms stage.

79
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:04,775
Boys, let's ventilate this.

80
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,568
[guns cocking]

81
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:14,994

[men screaming]

84
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:29,550
What the shit that just happened?

85
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,386
[mumbling gibberish]

86
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:41,353
[weakly] What the hell?
What in the hell?

87
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:47,944
"Hit the trail."
It was so simple.

88
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:52,489
You must stop doing this, White Knife.
One day, there will be too many.

89
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,700
But not today, Smoking Fox.

90
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:57,703
Please, my love...
we must go.

91
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,497
[shouting] What the hell
happened out here?

92
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,791
Injuns.
They went that way.

93
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:04,501
You ain't no white man.

94
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:07,796
You're that orphan, White Knife.

95
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,508
Raised like an animal with those Apaches.

96
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:13,677
[scoffs] You think you can fool ol' Clem?

97
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,886
Sorry, Ringo.

98
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:18,932
Well, now I'm gonna shoot you
and your Injun whore.

99
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,184
Gotta cut breakfast short.

100
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:25,231
[screaming]

101
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:27,649
You suck, mister!

102
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,444
[shouting] You suck!

103
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,324
What are you?

104
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,210
[all cheering]

105
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:51,007

[indistinct chattering]

107
00:06:58,055 --> 00:06:59,515
[child] Yes, White Knife.

108
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:00,849
Go, White Knife.

109
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,273
[all cheering] Yay!

110
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:08,983
You lucky, Smoking Fox.

111
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:12,153
White Knife all man.
Bravest of all braves.

112
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:15,572
Not brave. Foolish.

113
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:18,034
I want to be wife, not widow.

114
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:21,453
[horse neighs]

115
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:24,165
Afternoon, ladies.

116
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,126
[screaming and shouting]

117
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:31,922
This is Apache land.

118
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,716
I'm not here to take your land, Chief.

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,719
I'm just looking for a particular boy.

120
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:40,597
I'm Frank Stockburn.

121
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,392
This boy's mother was my wife.

122
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,353
And the boy, Tommy...

123
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:48,939
he's my son.

124
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:52,693
[indigenous music playing]

125
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:03,412
[chuckling]

126
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:06,248
It is wise to be slow to trust,
White Knife.

127
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:09,668
But every new journey begins
with a single step.

128
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:12,504
Speak with your father.

129
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,674
But you are my father,
Screaming Eagle.

130
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,052
Ever since my mother...

131
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,098
Ever since you found me...

132
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,433
you taught me to hunt,
to fight...

133
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:27,644
when to speak and when to be silent.

134
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,938
- To be a man.
- A good man.

135
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:31,648
And this Frank Stockburn,

136
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:35,194
he is filled with lies,
just like every other white man.

137
00:08:35,694 --> 00:08:38,989
Sometimes, the white man speaks the truth.

138
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,783
Like, one in 20, 25 times.

139
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,579
I believe this is one of those times.

140
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,083
He knew your mother, White Knife.

141
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:53,044
Maybe he can give you some peace.
Talk to him.

142
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,714
Maybe after I close my eyes to dream.

143
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:17,819
[crying]

144
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:20,656
Mommy!

145
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:22,658
[metal clanging]

146
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:34,420
[metal clanging]

147
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:48,225
[groans] Oh, no.

148
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,278
One look at me, and you knew your old man
had done a lot of bad things, didn't ya?

149
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:02,823
I cheated men, I killed men...

150
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,244
So I deserve whatever's comin' to me.

151
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:08,995
[sighs]

152
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,916
The only one that ever saw any good in me
was your mother.

153
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:17,671
Oh!

154
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:19,256
Why have you come here?

155
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:23,469
Not a man for chitchat, huh?
[chuckles]

156
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:26,638
Well, me neither.

157
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,141
Kid, I'm dying...

158
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,728
of consumption.

159
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:35,647
[chuckling]

160
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:38,525
Don't worry...

161
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:43,739
I'm not looking
for no big father-son hoo-ah.

162
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:45,324
"I love you, son."

163
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:47,117
[imitates child's voice]
"I love you too, Daddy."

00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,538
[coughing]

166
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:54,040
No.

167
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:59,921
I've come for a more tangible reason.

168
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:09,473
Tommy, I've been stealing from folks
since I was nine years old...

169
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:15,687
and that's the way I've amassed
a good little fortune.

170
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:19,400
[sighs] I wanna do something
decent with it.

171
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,320
I want to give it to you, son.

172
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,576
I don't want your money.

173
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,246
But maybe you could give...

174
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,709
$50,000 to these nice Injuns
who raised you.

175
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,002
We'll take it.

176
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,254
Go back to bed.

177
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:42,881
Sorry.

178
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,758
Seriously, though,
we'll take it.

179
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:48,304
Look, it's buried in the meadow
just up the trail,

180
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:50,472
next to a big ol' pine tree.

181
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,933
What do you say
we go dig it up in the morning

182
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:56,019
and start playing Santa Claus?

183
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:59,773
I don't remember much about my mother...

184
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:03,319
but I do remember her telling me...

185
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:06,738
you were dead.

186
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:09,491
[clicks tongue]

187
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:11,868
[exhales]

188
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,538
Maybe it was because...

189
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:17,958
she didn't want
you to come looking for me.

190
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,126
She was a smart lady.

191
00:12:21,294 --> 00:12:25,256
Only stupid thing she ever did
was fall for me.

192
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,884
Meeting Betty Dunson...

193
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,763
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

194
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:38,186
From the first day I laid eyes on her...

195
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:41,106
she was bawlin' out this...

196
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:46,111
half-drunk, big ol' burly blacksmith...

197
00:12:46,194 --> 00:12:48,739
down at Silver Canyon.

198
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:51,908
She's been the only one, Tommy.

199
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:00,626
Mom had a temper?

200
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:06,673
[chuckling] Temper?
When she got her dander up, look out.

201
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,592
We was in a saloon once.

202
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:10,844
This fellow sitting next to her

203
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:15,932
starts talking about the perfect way
to make a cherry pie...

204
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:20,812
So your mom says to me,
"Frank, come here a minute.

205
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:24,650
Tell me again,
just where did you get them flowers?"

206
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:28,779
I said, "I know that you think
I stole them from the graveyard."

207
00:13:28,862 --> 00:13:30,531
[both chuckling]

208
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,616
Good morning, boys.

209
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:35,118
Morning, Never Wears Bra.

210
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:38,038
I had dream about you last night,
White Knife.

211
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,956
Oh, that's nice.

212
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,291
Not nice dream.

213
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,503
In dream, you naughty.

214
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:46,713
You naughty, White Knife.

215
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:49,049
Mmm, somebody's got an admirer.

216
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,176
- [chuckles]
- Yes, yes.

217
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,262
But like you,
there's only one woman for me.

218
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:01,437
I guess we Stockburns are...

219
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,271
partial to the sweet ones.

220
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:04,731
Yes, sir.

221
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:06,608
Like your mother.

222
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,404
How did she die, Tommy?

223
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:13,782
You tell me?

224
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:20,831
Well, there were these big kids at school
fixin' to beat me up.

225
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,878
Instead of facing them myself,
I had her walk me there.

226
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:29,965
This feller comes out of nowhere...

227
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:33,677
walks right up to her and shoots her dead.

228
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,724
So that's how she died,
protecting her gutless son

229
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:42,894
instead of being home,
safe where she belonged.

230
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,065
[horses neighing]

231
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:48,484
[men shouting]

232
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,194
Who's that?
Is that Bony Express?

233
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:54,155
[Tommy] Bony Express
don't come around here.

234
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,116
[howling]

235
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,743
- [man] Giddyap!
- [howling continues]

236
00:14:57,826 --> 00:14:59,369
[screaming]

237
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:12,173
He's here somewhere, boys.

238
00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:13,467
Let's burn him out!

239
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,968
[Bony Express Gang shouting]

240
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,094
[man] Oh...

241
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,096
Next one goes through your forehead.

242
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:21,933
Hey, hey!
No need to burn nothing, boys!

243
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,019
Howdy, boss.

244
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:25,228
Cicero...

245
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:30,233
you're not gonna let a man
enjoy his retirement, are ya?

246
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:34,863
No, Frank, I salute your decision
to turn from your sinful ways.

247
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,698
But the money...

248
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,492
that belongs to all of us.

249
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:39,910
Touch that steel, boy,

250
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:43,163
I got plenty of bullets left over
after I put one in...

251
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,125
your father.

252
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,919
[chuckles]

253
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:52,088
Oh, you finally found your long lost son.

254
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:55,509
Well, I sure hate to break up
this nice family reunion.

255
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:58,887
So, why don't you give us
the money you stole

256
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,765
before I put lead in your head.

257
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:09,064
The money's buried.

258
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:11,357
Way to run your mouth, son.

259
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:12,859
It's buried?

260
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:14,695
Yeah, I buried it.

261
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:18,281
Deep in the ground...
next to a windmill.

262
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:20,659
A windmill in the West...

263
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,869
doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.

264
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:25,330
Well, this is a special windmill.

265
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,124
It's a singing windmill.

266
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,001
[all laughing]

267
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,502
[Cicero] A singing windmill!

268
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,800
It's about a ten-day ride from here.

269
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,928
I'll lead you to it presently
on one condition.

270
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:42,347
You don't hurt my boy...

271
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,851
or any of these kindly Injuns here.

272
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:48,979
Let's ride, Frank.

273
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,731
[speaking Spanish]

274
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:04,535
Frank, if that $50,000
isn't under that windmill,

275
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,329
I'm gonna bury you up to your neck

276
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:08,999
and let the desert critters eat you alive.

277
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:11,459
It's there, Cicero, it's there.

278
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:15,255
I'm glad I got to meet Betty Dunson's son.

279
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:18,424
You just stay here, Tommy.

280
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:20,844
Enjoy your life
with your beautiful bride...

281
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:25,974
amongst these majestic pine trees.

282
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,310
Let's go!

283
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:52,709
Well, that was uncool.

284
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:05,180
White Knife, you must rest.

285
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,723
How can I rest?

286
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:10,476
When they get to the singing windmill
and find no money, they will kill him.

287
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,856
My son, there are too many trees
and too little time.

288
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:19,527
Then I must get this $50,000 another way.

289
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,531
How? By stealing?
There is no honor in that.

290
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:28,954
Unless I steal from those
who have no honor.

291
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:32,248
Ooh... I like that.

292
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,250
But it is too dangerous.

293
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,795
I will send ten of our
strongest braves with you.

294
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,213
No.

295
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:41,341
The braves would be treated too cruelly
in the white man's world.

296
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,634
A lot of them can pass for pale face.

297
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:46,930
Raging Bear can actually do
a great impression of a white guy.

298
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:50,976
Hey, guys, let's play with our chest hair
and eat potato chips.

299
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,686
[all laughing]

300
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,481
Wasn't that great?
Where does he come up with this stuff?

301
00:18:56,564 --> 00:19:00,318
That's very good, Bear,
but I must walk this path alone.

302
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:05,240
My love...
I will get this money...

303
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:07,617
bring it to the singing windmill,

304
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,786
and be back in time for our wedding.

305
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,747
I won't let you go.

306
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:13,999
Those men are killers.

307
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:18,378
I was a coward once
and my mother paid the price.

308
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,716
That will not happen to my father.

309
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,526
Whoa!

310
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,779
- [horse neighs]
- Good morning.

311
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,696
Where in the hell did you come from?

312
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,866
I'm in a bit of a bind, boys.

313
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:50,744
I rode all the way out here
to pan for gold

314
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:52,871
and my horse up and died on me.

315
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:54,455
How'd he die?

316
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,166
Suicide.

317
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:58,043
Drowned himself.

318
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:01,504
Put his head in the stream
and just kept it there.

319
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:03,173
Saddest thing you ever seen.

320
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:05,175
It happens.

321
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:08,219
Powers that be don't like to admit it,
but it happens.

322
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:10,471
He looks like an honest white guy.

323
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:12,307
Hop on.

324
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:14,225
Much obliged.

325
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,645
[Tommy] Just drop me off
at the nearest town.

326
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,278
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around.

327
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:28,448
Hear the wondrous effects
of Dr. Chubb's Vita Oil,

328
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,909
the miracle cure for 1001 ailments.

329
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:32,828
Put the pep back in your...

330
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:34,620
Who's this asshole?

331
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,999
[indistinct chattering]

332
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:52,347
Well, now, look at this fella,
drinking from the horse trough.

333
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,431
Excuse me.

334
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:55,934
You there!

335
00:20:57,352 --> 00:21:00,063
What you're doing is disgusting.

336
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:02,482
That water is for our filthy horses.

337
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:06,862
Water flows from the sky spirit
for all its children.

338
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:08,154
Isn't that right, cousin?

339
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:12,200
We don't cotton to that peyote-smoking
nonsense around these parts.

340
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:14,244
Do you hear me, "cousin"?

341
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:18,581
[chuckling] Okay, William, come on back.

342
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:20,125
Hey, <i>amigo.</i>

343
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,752
You planning on staying in town?

344
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,214
Might need a place
to lay my head for a bit.

345
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:37,433
Sorry about that ugly man
that insulted you.

346
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:41,646
He runs the bank, so he thinks
he's entitled to be mean to everyone.

347
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:43,606
There's a bank in this town?

348
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:45,400
Why? You wanna rob it?

349
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:48,694
I look like a bank robber to you, ma'am?

350
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:53,699
Funny, there's something about you that
reminds me of a certain bank robber.

351
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:56,244
His name was Frank Stockburn.

352
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,705
You know Frank Stockburn?

353
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,875
"Know"? Like, in the biblical sense?

354
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,378
No, ma'am.
You've met him before is what I'm asking.

355
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,838
Yes, I met him.

356
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:09,382
Then, 20 minutes later,

357
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:12,928
I knew him in the biblical sense
on that bed, right there.

358
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:14,012
Oh.

359
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:18,975
And, I knew him, in the biblical sense,
twice on this railing.

360
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,060
Uh-huh.

361
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:24,480
And then, while doing a handstand
on that dresser you're leaning against.

362
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,278
Did he happen to mention
a singing windmill?

363
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:33,198
He did mention a singing windmill.

364
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:36,159
He said it sounded like a choir of angels.

365
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:37,953
Where'd he say it was?

366
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:43,041
He said that it was in a place
where he made his biggest score.

367
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:45,168
Whatever that was.

368
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:46,502
And then he laughed.

369
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:48,796
He liked to laugh...

370
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:50,881
and have handstand sex.

371
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,842
Yeah, we gotta get past that.

372
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,177
I miss him.

373
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,221
But he did leave me something
to remember him by.

374
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:57,680
What's this?

375
00:22:57,763 --> 00:23:01,184
A <i>niño,</i> Ramon.

376
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:04,395
I have a brother?

377
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:08,441
Oh, Burro, we had many adventures
together, you and me.

378
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:10,026
We're not getting any younger.

379
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,402
[chuckles]

380
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:14,197
At least we have our memories.

381
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,948
[laughing]

382
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:19,995
Remember the two girls,
the sisters, in Deadwood?

383
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:21,371
You liked the fat one.

384
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:23,039
[laughing]

385
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,707
You know it's true.

386
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,292
[Tommy] Ramon Lopez?

387
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:28,628
<i>Sí.</i>

388
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:34,425
I just came from conversating
with your mother, Esmerelda.

389
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:39,430
We stumbled upon the fact that
your dad and my dad...

390
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,767
are the same fella.

391
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,935
Oh, that's neat.

392
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,687
Yeah.

393
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,981
Same father.

394
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:51,151
Half-brothers.

395
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:53,194
What do you think about that, Burro?

396
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,906
So, how is Dad?

397
00:23:56,989 --> 00:24:00,076
Well, he went and got himself kidnapped,

398
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,996
and I need to come up with $50,000
to save his life.

399
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,457
That's a lot of pesos.

400
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,667
Sure is.

401
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:11,962
That's why I'm fixin'
to rob the bank here in town.

402
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,299
Hang on.

403
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:17,968
My father is in trouble.

404
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:20,971
My brother, he needs my help.

405
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:24,684
I'll rob the bank with you.

406
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,686
I must do this alone.

407
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:31,316
What's happening right now?

408
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,320
Ever since I'm <i>pequeño,</i>

409
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:40,158
I dream about spending
one magical day with <i>mi padre,</i>

410
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:44,120
sharing meals,
introducing him to the burro.

411
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:50,000
I will not let go of you
until you say I can help you.

412
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:59,719
Will you stop brushing me
if I say yes?

413
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:00,886
Yes.

414
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,307
Then you can help.

415
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:10,855
[farting]

416
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:19,864
That means he likes you.

417
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:21,824
[horse whinnying]

418
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:23,409
[indistinct chatter]

419
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:40,801
That's a good amount of money
you want us to lend you.

420
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:43,929
Now, normally, we would require
two forms of identification, madam,

421
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:46,974
but that won't be necessary in your case.

422
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:49,977
- [woman sighs]
- I feel kinda guilty about this, Burro,

423
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,896
taking money from nice people.

424
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:54,315
I mean, it's not like
you're some greasy Mexican.

425
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:56,151
- [speaking gibberish]
- [laughing]

426
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:57,693
I feel less guilty now.

427
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:01,489
What are you doing?

428
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,491
This is a bank!

429
00:26:03,574 --> 00:26:05,326
Get that donkey out of here!

430
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,119
It is a burro, <i>señor.</i>

431
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:09,997
I don't care, <i>"señor."</i>
Get it out!

432
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,832
All right.
<i>Vámonos.</i>

433
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:15,711
The burro don't want to <i>vámonos.</i>

434
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:19,674
Well, I don't really care
what the burro wants.

435
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:25,638
Get out of my bank, you beast!

436
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:28,183
I know what you're thinking,
but not yet.

437
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:29,559
Hold it.

438
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:31,561
[bank manager straining] Move!

439
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,575
How is this jackass stuck?

440
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:48,453
If it got in here,
it can certainly get out!

441
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:51,247
It doesn't make sense,
it's not logical.

442
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,250
They got it locked up good,
do they?

443
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,670
Oh! You are leaving!

444
00:26:58,754 --> 00:26:59,964
[groans]

445
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:01,216
[laughs]

446
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:04,219
Gall dang,
he felled on his pooper!

447
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:06,053
[laughing]

448
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:20,150
- [bank manager] That makes no sense!
- [Ramon stammering] I apologize.

449
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:22,570
- I don't know how many times I could...
- Hey, friend.

450
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:24,489
Need any help gettin' her out?

451
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:27,199
[quietly] She's not
really stuck, <i>amigo.</i>

452
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:28,868
She's just a diversion.

453
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:31,078
She's a virgin?

454
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:33,248
I'm a virgin, too...

455
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:35,291
unless you count canty-loupes.

456
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,378
I believe that,
but she's a diversion

457
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:40,045
to keep the banker busy

458
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:42,798
so that my brother has time
to rob the bank.

459
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:44,967
[stammers] You're robbin' the bank?

460
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,761
- Gall dang!
- Shh, shh.

461
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:49,347

Gall dang. Gall dang.

Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,987
No! Virgil! Virgil, the key!

466
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:09,325
I'm Lil Pete.

467
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:11,035
So, is your father, like, Big Pete?

468
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:13,120
I didn't know my pa.

469
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:16,541
But he was a bank robber like y'all!
His name was Frank.

470
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,460
- Stockburn?
- How'd you know?

471
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:22,212
Are you a wizard?

472
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:27,552
[Frank] <i>Hey, Johnny Law.</i>

What?

476
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:35,851
Robbery!

477
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:38,187
We're being burgled!

You! Horse-water-drinker!

You are caught, sir!

What are you?

482
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,668
Hey, Tommy, guess what?
We got ourselves a little brother.

483
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:03,879
Yeah! All our moms got porked
by the same outlaw.

484
00:29:03,963 --> 00:29:05,840
- Ain't that a pip?
- Yeah, that's something.

485
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:08,718
Hey! Those <i>bandidos</i> just robbed the bank!

00:29:11,637 --> 00:29:14,014
Taste my bullets,
you dirty foreigners!

488
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:15,558
Now!

489
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,356
- Nice one, Burro.
- Wow!

490
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,732
- There they are!
- [Ramon] We better make tracks.

491
00:29:22,815 --> 00:29:24,317
Can I come with?
I got a wagon.

492
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,276
All right, that ain't a bad idea,
let's go.

493
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:27,862
[Ramon] <i>Vámonos.</i> Come on!

494
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:30,615
[Lil Pete] So, if you guys are
my brothers,

495
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:32,450
you must got three nipples, too.

496
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,743
[Ramon] I only got two.

497
00:29:33,826 --> 00:29:35,370
[Tommy] Yeah, just got the two.

498
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,663
[Lil Pete] Oh, must be
from my mama's side.

499
00:29:37,747 --> 00:29:39,624
Forget I tolded you that, okay?

500
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:40,791
[Tommy] Will do.

501
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:44,086
[Will Patch] Are you ready, Clem?

502
00:29:45,295 --> 00:29:47,673
[Clem] Yep, yep. I'm... I'm ready.

503
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:55,055
Spoon.

504
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:58,100
Damn sharp.

505
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:09,194
Look, fellas, I wanna hunt
this white Injun down same as you.

506
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:11,030
But, uh... I...

507
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,367
I have some problems with my eyes.

508
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,454
You wanna join the Left-Eye Gang,
that right eye has gotta come out.

509
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,540
It'll only hurt for a second.

510
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:23,208
Yeah, like a hundred seconds.

511
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:26,170
- Then you're one of us.
- For life.

512
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:29,214
Okay, that makes sense.

513
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:35,012
Is it okay if I scoop this left eye out?

514
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:36,847
This is... I'm basically blind here.

515
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:39,099
This right one sees like an eagle.

516
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:42,102
Yeah, it just seems
like a waste that I'd...

517
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:45,523
I understand your predicament,
but rules is rules.

518
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:48,108
Yeah, guess it... makes sense.

519
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,071
[breathing heavily]

520
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:55,032
Oh, God!

521
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:57,493
- [Clem grunting]
- [Gus Patch] Hell, no!

522
00:30:57,577 --> 00:31:00,287
That ain't right!

523
00:31:01,205 --> 00:31:02,707
- [grunts]
- [Gus Patch] Damn!

524
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,124
[Will Patch] It's half way.

525
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,001
- It's dangling by a vein!
- [Clem] Whoo! Oh, man!

526
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:08,378
It's crazy,
I can still see out of it!

527
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:09,880
- Goddamn, it hurts!
- I think I'm gonna puke.

528
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:13,258
It's just going round and round like
a tassel on a stripper's titty!

529
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:14,927
Okay, gotta get it, gotta get it!

530
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,554
I'm getting dizzy!

531
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,305
Got it, got it, got it!

532
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:19,389
Yeah!

533
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,183
[groaning] Ah!

534
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:24,144
Oh, Lord! Holy shit.

535
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:29,024
You done it, partner.
Welcome to the Left-Eye Gang.

536
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:30,150
Whoo!

537
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,486
I did it!

538
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:34,655
[laughing] I'm glad that's done.

539
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:37,617
Let's just go get that
Injun-loving son of a bitch, huh?

540
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,743
Yeah.

541
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,911
- Yeah! Let's get him.
- Yeah.

542
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:43,205
Like, so...

543
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:45,374
Oh, I touched the hole.
I touched the hole!

544
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:50,254
Got me a patch! [chuckles]

545
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,135
[Lil Pete] <i>Dear Mama,</i>
<i>you may be wondering</i>

546
00:31:56,218 --> 00:32:00,389
<i>why I have not returned
from my trip to the ice cream store.</i>

547
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:04,852
<i>It's because I met my brothers,
Ramon and Tommy.</i>

548
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:07,104
<i>And we're trying to steal money.</i>

549
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:10,733
<i>We need the money
to give to the bad men</i>

550
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:15,655
<i>who took Pa away
to the land of the singing windmill.</i>

551
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:20,618
<i>Tommy says it's not okay
to take money from decent folks.</i>

552
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:21,702
I got the money!

553
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:24,539
<i>Luckily, there's a lot of bad people
here in the West.</i>

554
00:32:24,622 --> 00:32:26,206
Yee-haw!

555
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,500
Let's ride!

556
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:33,005
- [Ramon] Eat it! You know you like it.
- [Lil Pete laughing]

557
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:34,799
[Ramon] You know you like it.

558
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:36,676
Good God!

559
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,261
[laughing] Good burro!

560
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:40,596
[Ramon] That's right.

561
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,681
Enjoy it!

562
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:45,184
- That's just wrong.
- Yeah, yeah.

563
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,268
Is it?

564
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:57,446
[Lil Pete continues laughing]

565
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:01,033
[laughing]

566
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:04,453
This is so much better
than the cantaloupe.

567
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,288
[continues laughing]

568
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,543
Good burro!

569
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:13,378
[Lil Pete] <i>Slowly, but surely,</i>

570
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:18,217
<i>we're chippin' away
at the $50,000 we need to save Pa.</i>

571
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,720
<i>That's a lot of money,
isn't it, Mama?</i>

572
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:23,430
<i>Mama?</i>

573
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:29,562
[laughs] <i>Oh, yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>I'm writing you a letter.</i>

574
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:34,900
<i>Anyways, I can't wait
to actually meet my pa.</i>

575
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:37,527
<i>I want him to teach me
how you make babies.</i>

576
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:41,073
<i>And how the lady poops 'em out.</i>

577
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:43,618
<i>Be home quick as I can.</i>

578
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,912
<i>Your loving son, Lil Pete.</i>

579
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:49,749
[crow cawing]

580
00:34:11,228 --> 00:34:12,479
Tommy?

581
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,356
Yeah, Lil Pete?

582
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:17,192
Where's the singing windmill?

583
00:34:17,276 --> 00:34:19,820
It's where dad made
his biggest score.

584
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:23,991
Maybe we'll get another clue
up at Jawbone Falls.

585
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:27,494
That's where he used to hide out
when he was an outlaw.

586
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:30,706
[laughs] Oh, cool beans.

587
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:35,628
Tommy?

588
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:37,630
Yeah, Lil Pete?

589
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:40,590
If we get caught stealing...

590
00:34:41,258 --> 00:34:42,968
would we be in trouble?

591
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:47,556
I reckon we'll hang.

592
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:53,478
Well... that's no bother.

593
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:56,481
I got a real strong neck.

594
00:34:56,565 --> 00:35:00,527
Mama makes me pull the plow with my head
if I don't finish my schoolwork.

595
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:03,280
[chuckling] Which occurs regularilly.

596
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:07,910
Strong neck might come in handy.

597
00:35:07,993 --> 00:35:10,871
Okay, let's get our rest.

598
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,333
Good night, Tommy.

599
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,086
Good night, Lil Pete.

600
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:19,588
[Lil Pete] Good night, Ramon.

601
00:35:19,672 --> 00:35:21,090
[Ramon] Good night, brothers.

602
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:23,258
Good night, Burro.

603
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:24,927
[farts]

604
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:29,223
[Ramon] That's a dry one.

605
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:31,266
We will have good dry weather tomorrow.

606
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:39,274
[sighs]

607
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:43,738
[fly buzzing]

608
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:46,531
[Lil Pete] Shoo, fly!

609
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:47,742
Shoo!

610
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:53,372
[Ramon] Oh, come on, fly, <i>vámonos!</i>
We need our sleep.

611
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:57,084
[fly continues buzzing]

612
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,378
[Tommy] Let me take care of this.

613
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,213
[Ramon] How can you see a fly in the dark?

614
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:04,549
[Tommy] A true hunter sees
with all his senses.

615
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:07,219
[buzzing stops]

616
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,057
[Ramon] That was some mystical shit, man.

617
00:36:13,558 --> 00:36:14,601
[shrill buzzing]

618
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,603
[Lil Pete] Uh-oh.

619
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:19,064
I think you just nicked his biscuits off.

620
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:21,316
[Tommy] That's what I was aiming for.

621
00:36:22,317 --> 00:36:24,069
He didn't deserve to die.

622
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:27,656
He deserved to know
he was not welcome here.

623
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,617
[Ramon] Raised by Indians, huh?

624
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,787
That had some impact on you.

625
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,873
[fly buzzing]

626
00:36:35,956 --> 00:36:37,833
[Ramon] Well, let me get this one.

627
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:40,127
[gunshots]

628
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:44,631
- [horse neighing]
- [thudding]

629
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:47,927
[Ramon] Sounded like a horse fly.

630
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,805
That wasn't a horse fly,
that was my horse!

631
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:52,347
Peanut?

632
00:36:52,431 --> 00:36:54,224
Oh, Peanut!

633
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:58,520
[Ramon] Oh, the burro's gonna be pissed.

634
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:01,273
[Ramon] You're doing <i>bueno,</i> Burro!

635
00:37:01,356 --> 00:37:04,234
Don't be intimidated by the horse,
you're just as good as him.

636
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:06,236
[Lil Pete] I'm so hungry.

637
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,447
[Tommy] There's breakfast all around.

638
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,327
Nuts, berries, bark,
different kinds of mud.

639
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,579
I wish there were taco trees.

640
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:17,122
What's a taco?

641
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,623
They're the best.

642
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:22,336
Meat and cheese and tomatoes
in a crispy shell.

643
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:23,838
You'd love it, man.

644
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:26,340
Ooh, I want one.
I want 50.

645
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:29,093
Hate to put an end

01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:15,799
You said you could only advance
after you hit the ball!

1125
01:05:15,883 --> 01:05:18,093
Not when you're stealing.

1126
01:05:18,176 --> 01:05:19,803
That's bullshit.

1127

Okay, Short Stop.

Why's that?

1134
01:05:56,632 --> 01:06:00,969
Because those are the rules

and then start the second half.

Mr. Doubleday, we're done.

1150
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:45,723
But we've only played nine innings.

1151
01:06:45,806 --> 01:06:49,560
Nine innings is enough.
Tell us about Dad's biggest score.

1152
01:06:49,643 --> 01:06:51,228
Fine.

1153
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:57,693

an entire cavalry regiment, 120 men,

Well, fellas,

1160
01:07:11,414 --> 01:07:15,418
looks like we're going to Sweet Hog Rock
to find ourselves a singing windmill.

1161
01:07:15,502 --> 01:07:17,212
But we still need another 10,000 bucks.

1162
01:07:17,295 --> 01:07:19,632
I reckon we'll make a quick stop, then.

1163
01:07:19,715 --> 01:07:21,466
Before you go...

1164
01:07:21,549 --> 01:07:24,511
do you wanna line up and shake hands
and say "good game" to each other?

1165
01:07:25,137 --> 01:07:26,138
No.

1166
01:07:27,598 --> 01:07:29,642
Them boys were nice fellers.

1167

Paid in cash.
Kept the profanity to a minimum.

1168
01:07:33,103 --> 01:07:37,024
And the Mexican brother knocked
this hard-ass' head off with a shovel?

1169
01:07:37,107 --> 01:07:40,861

And still a-smilin'.

Wish he'd glue the head back on my pecker.

1175
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:57,335
What happened to your pecker?

1176
01:07:57,419 --> 01:08:00,673

- will be real excited to see them.
- [snickering]

01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:22,035
[mouthing] No.

1281
01:13:22,953 --> 01:13:24,454
[birds chirping]

1282
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:25,705
[eagle screeching]

1283
01:13:33,921 --> 01:13:37,968
How are we gonna save him?
We're startin' all over.

1284
01:13:38,051 --> 01:13:40,387
Is there any more good places
we can rob?

1285
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:44,182
You know like a burro-grooming place
or a shoe store for burros?

1286
01:13:44,849 --> 01:13:47,602
Half the lawmen in the West
are already looking for us.

1287
01:13:47,685 --> 01:13:50,355
So what?
Look, we can't stop.

1288
01:13:50,438 --> 01:13:51,689
They're going to kill him!

1289
01:13:51,773 --> 01:13:54,151
Ain't no difference.
He's dying anyways.

1290
01:13:58,196 --> 01:13:59,864
Dad's sick.

1291
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:02,659
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all.

1292
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:05,996
There's a good chance
he's dead already.

1293
01:14:08,831 --> 01:14:12,710
But there's a chance he's not.
You got to meet him, Tommy.

1294
01:14:12,794 --> 01:14:14,712
The rest of us...

1295
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:17,299
Even if it was just for five minutes,
it'd be worth it.

1296
01:14:17,382 --> 01:14:23,180
If I don't talk to Dad, I'll die with this
dirty secret burnin' a hole in my guts.

1297
01:14:23,263 --> 01:14:27,934
Danito, whatever it is you did,
you have to forgive yourself, man.

1298
01:14:28,018 --> 01:14:30,353
You wouldn't say that if you know
what I done.

1299
01:14:30,437 --> 01:14:32,897
- Everybody's got secrets, Danny.
- [Ramon] Yeah.

1300
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,358
You guys are the first people
I told I was black.

1301
01:14:35,442 --> 01:14:37,902
You know how good that made me feel?

1302
01:14:37,985 --> 01:14:40,072
We're your brothers.

1303
01:14:40,155 --> 01:14:42,157
You can tell us anything.

1304
01:14:43,908 --> 01:14:45,035
I, uh...

1305
01:14:46,828 --> 01:14:48,288
[sighs]

1306
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:51,124
I used to work
for the President of the United States.

1307
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:52,834
[grunts]

1308
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:54,919
I was his personal bodyguard.

1309
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,172
One of the best.

1310
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,966
Till one night...

1311
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:01,634
[indistinct talking]

1312
01:15:05,012 --> 01:15:08,266
Mr. President, say, I'm gonna go
hit the little boys' room.

1313
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:10,602
Are you shitting me?

1314
01:15:10,685 --> 01:15:12,937
Come on!
You'll be fine, superstar.

1315
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,274
Can I get ya something on the way back?
<i>Agua?</i> Brewski?

1316
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:17,484
No!

1317
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:20,778
Mrs. Lincoln, how about one of them
big pretzels or a little pillow?

1318
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:22,780
I hear this play's kind of a long one.

1319
01:15:23,906 --> 01:15:26,409
All right, fair enough.
I'll be back in two.

1320
01:15:32,415 --> 01:15:33,458
[gasps]

1321
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,377
Where's the president's box?

1322
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:38,088
- John Wilkes Booth, the actor?
- Yeah.

1323
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:40,923
No way, man! Big fan!

1324
01:15:41,007 --> 01:15:42,842
- You wanna say hi to the president?
- Yeah.

1325
01:15:42,925 --> 01:15:45,553
He'd get a real kick out of that.
Last door on the left.

1326
01:15:45,637 --> 01:15:47,639
- Thank you. [chuckles nervously]
- Really cool.

1327
01:15:47,722 --> 01:15:50,142
Wow! Love that guy!

1328
01:15:52,269 --> 01:15:55,563
- [gunshot]
- [woman screams]

1329
01:15:55,647 --> 01:15:59,651
[screaming] Abe!

1330
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:08,535
[sighs] How can you go on living your life
knowing you harmed so many people?

1331
01:16:08,618 --> 01:16:10,453
That's what I wanna ask Dad.

1332
01:16:10,537 --> 01:16:13,915
Hey, you ain't the one
who pulled that trigger.

1333
01:16:13,998 --> 01:16:16,959
But if Dad's gotta be
the one who tells you that...

1334
01:16:19,129 --> 01:16:20,880
then let's go get that money.

1335
01:16:20,963 --> 01:16:23,466
I just wish I knew how.

1336
01:16:25,677 --> 01:16:27,011
[speaking gibberish]

1337
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:28,346
Herm's got an idea.

1338
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:29,639
[speaking gibberish]

1339
01:16:29,722 --> 01:16:31,141
He just can't express it.

1340
01:16:32,767 --> 01:16:34,852
I just wish somebody here
could speak Herm.

1341
01:16:35,603 --> 01:16:36,896
[chanting]

1342
01:16:41,526 --> 01:16:43,820
[man] <i>Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.</i>

1343
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:48,450
<i>That's when Ezekiel Grant has his annual
high-stakes poker game.</i>

1344
01:16:48,533 --> 01:16:52,287
<i>There'll be oodles of money there.
Oodles, I say.</i>

1345
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:53,830
Ooh.

1346
01:16:53,913 --> 01:16:56,916
- I don't know. That sounds risky.
- What's risky?

1347
01:16:56,999 --> 01:17:01,213
He's suggesting we...
knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.

1348
01:17:01,296 --> 01:17:02,547
- It's in Yuma tomorrow night.
- [speaks gibberish]

1349
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,882
Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.

1350
01:17:04,966 --> 01:17:08,720
That poker game, there's practically
gonna be an army protectin' it.

1351
01:17:08,803 --> 01:17:12,974
If Tommy says we can beat 'em,
I'll believe him.

1352
01:17:13,057 --> 01:17:16,018
- We all will.
- [grunts]

1353
01:17:18,271 --> 01:17:19,606
We can beat 'em...

1354
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,024
for Dad.

1355
01:17:22,108 --> 01:17:23,735
[all] For Dad!

1356
01:17:23,818 --> 01:17:24,819
[speaks gibberish]

1357
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:42,712
I hope you like the gift I'm giving you
for Valentine's Day, Ezekiel.

1358
01:17:42,795 --> 01:17:47,133
I'll give you a hint.
One-hour massage, no charge.

1359
01:17:47,217 --> 01:17:49,511
Oh, Susannah.

1360
01:17:49,594 --> 01:17:51,471
You know what gift I'd really love?

1361
01:17:51,554 --> 01:17:54,224
If you would just shut up!

1362
01:17:54,849 --> 01:17:57,644
Nothing ruins a good poker game more...

1363
01:17:57,727 --> 01:18:01,523
than a lady jabbering on and on...

1364
01:18:01,606 --> 01:18:03,816
- How romantic.
- [knocking on door]

1365
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:06,653
[clears throat]

1366
01:18:06,736 --> 01:18:07,737
- Hello!
- Hello!

1367
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:10,197
Well, General Custer!

1368
01:18:10,282 --> 01:18:11,616
Yes, at your service.

1369
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:13,243
Mr. Mark Twain.

1370
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:15,370
- Word up!
- Gentlemen, do come in.

1371
01:18:15,453 --> 01:18:20,041
Yo, Zeke, big boy, I was just going off
to the General here about my new book.

1372
01:18:20,124 --> 01:18:22,335
- It's a sequel to <i>Tom Sawyer.</i>
- Ooh.

1373
01:18:22,419 --> 01:18:25,297
It's about Sawyer's home slice,
Huckleberry Finn.

1374
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:29,216
White boy goes raftin' with a brother.
People gonna lose their shit!

1375
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:30,302
[all laughing]

1376
01:18:30,385 --> 01:18:34,639
And, General Custer, I see you've let
your dashing blond hair grow out.

1377
01:18:34,722 --> 01:18:37,892
Well, yes, the barber down at
the regiment is just awful,

1378
01:18:37,975 --> 01:18:41,646
so I had two choices,
either let it grow or get scalped.

1379
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:44,441
- And I ain't gonna let that happen.
- [Mark and Ezekiel laughing]

1380
01:18:44,524 --> 01:18:47,402
Now, will our old friend
from Tombstone be joining us?

1381
01:18:47,485 --> 01:18:48,528
[Ezekiel] Late as usual.

1382
01:18:48,611 --> 01:18:53,991
But we have a new player,
a wealthy Mexican coffee bean rancher.

1383
01:18:54,075 --> 01:18:55,159
Am I tardy-o?

1384
01:18:55,242 --> 01:18:58,204
Oh. [laughing] Sneaky little Mexican.

1385
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:01,666
May I present Don Don Diego.

1386
01:19:03,293 --> 01:19:04,461
[speaking Spanish]

1387
01:19:04,544 --> 01:19:07,254
We run a gentleman's game here, Mr. Diego.

1388
01:19:07,339 --> 01:19:10,883
Your, uh, two bodyguards
are completely unnecessary.

1389
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:12,802
Bodyguards? [laughing]

1390
01:19:13,803 --> 01:19:15,430
[lisping] You're mistaken, General.

1391
01:19:15,513 --> 01:19:17,432
This is, um...

1392
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:21,561
Chimichanga... my loyal manservant.

1393
01:19:21,644 --> 01:19:23,270
[speaking gibberish]

1394
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:24,397
God bless you.

1395
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:25,982
[Ramon] And, um...

1396
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:29,694
Blanco Beardio.

1397
01:19:30,862 --> 01:19:33,823
He'll be providing the entertainment
for this afternoon's festivities.

1398
01:19:33,906 --> 01:19:35,408
Well, drop me a beat.

1399
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:39,537
[piano playing]

1400
01:19:41,414 --> 01:19:42,415
Okay.

1401
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:45,167
All right.

1402
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:48,755
Here we go now.

1403
01:19:53,801 --> 01:19:55,302
[laughing]

1404
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:58,723
Gentlemen, the buy-in is $15,000.

1405
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:00,224
Fifteen large?

1406
01:20:00,307 --> 01:20:02,059
Are you sure General Custard
can swing that?

1407
01:20:02,143 --> 01:20:06,606
It's Custer, not "Custard."
There is no "D." I'm not a dessert.

1408
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:09,526
Boom, I just dropped some satire
on your ass, General!

1409
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:11,068
[all laughing]

1410
01:20:11,152 --> 01:20:12,194
You got me!

1411
01:20:13,738 --> 01:20:16,323
Hey! Now, when Ramon gives
the signal that the time is right,

1412
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:17,825
that's when we move in.

1413
01:20:17,909 --> 01:20:19,369
You remember the signal, right?

1414
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:27,669
- [man] Gentlemen.
- You know where to go, Marshal.

1415
01:20:28,252 --> 01:20:29,712
Oh, hell, no!

1416
01:20:29,796 --> 01:20:31,631
That's Wyatt Earp!

1417
01:20:31,714 --> 01:20:34,050
The fastest gun in the West?

1418
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:38,054
All right, all right, all right!

1419
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:41,516
- Oh, Wyatt Earp, as I live and breathe!
- [whispers] Wyatt Earp.

1420
01:20:41,599 --> 01:20:43,309
[Ezekiel] You're here!
[General Custer] Wyatt Earp.

1421
01:20:43,393 --> 01:20:44,811
[Wyatt] Sorry I'm late, everybody.

1422
01:20:44,894 --> 01:20:49,106
But apparently, there's some new gang
out there robbing everybody blind.

1423
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,900
Oh, they call themselves
the Ridiculous 6.

1424
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:54,529
I swear, a man can't ride
five miles in this territory

1425
01:20:54,612 --> 01:20:58,074
without running into outlaws,
rattlesnakes, Injuns and...

1426
01:20:58,157 --> 01:21:01,035
Hey! Why don't you let me
worry about the Injuns?

1427
01:21:01,118 --> 01:21:03,370
- [all laughing]
- [Wyatt] Will do, General.

1428
01:21:03,455 --> 01:21:05,289
[all continue laughing]

1429
01:21:05,915 --> 01:21:07,124
What's shakin', Twain?

1430
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:09,794
Hey, I'm good on anything.
Just like gravy, baby.

1431
01:21:09,877 --> 01:21:11,671
- Good to see you, my man.
- You too, man.

1432
01:21:11,754 --> 01:21:14,424
Hey! I finally read <i>Prince and the Pauper.</i>

Oh, is that right?

1434

Didn't get it.

1435

For reals?

I can't read.

Good one with the... satire.

1440
01:21:33,025 --> 01:21:34,777
[laughs] Funny.

Who's this idiot?

Um... I am Don...

Don Don Diego.

Well, Don, I'm Wyatt...

Let's get inside before this Wyatt Earp

But there's no way for you to sneak
past them guys, Tommy.

There's no rocks, no trees,
no nothing to hide behind.

1462
01:22:32,835 --> 01:22:37,298
No need to hide, brother,
when you are friends with the wind.

1463
01:22:37,381 --> 01:22:40,092
I'm telling you, down there,
they don't call it "Mexico."

1464
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:45,306
It's "Mehico." The "X" is an "H."
I'm presuming Texas is "Tehas."

1465
01:22:47,058 --> 01:22:49,185
Now, what's this?

1466
01:22:49,268 --> 01:22:51,813
Just a tumbleweed,

but I haven't the strength
to do it myself.

1472
01:23:22,218 --> 01:23:25,972
I'd love to help, ma'am, but I really
should keep playing the piano.

[General Custer] Take that and that.
[Mark] Yeah!

1479
01:23:42,154 --> 01:23:45,366
Sure is some good hooch there, Zeke.
Where'd you find that?

1480
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:49,912
Oh, I got that from a case
about, uh, 20 years ago.

1481
01:23:49,996 --> 01:23:53,457
In fact, uh, you know that shack
up by Jawbone Falls?

1482
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:56,085
- Yeah.
- There was a lady living there.

1483
01:23:56,168 --> 01:23:58,755
It was one of Frank Stockburn's
many paramours.

1484
01:23:58,838 --> 01:24:03,509
Now this was one of the ugliest ladies
I've ever seen in my life.

1485
01:24:03,593 --> 01:24:05,552
Sounds like a real bucket of turds.

1486
01:24:05,637 --> 01:24:09,724
But she was a very talented
distiller of alcohol.

1487
01:24:09,807 --> 01:24:12,226
[chucking] So, while she...

1488
01:24:12,309 --> 01:24:15,688
While she's loading up my coach,
her young boy comes out,

1489
01:24:15,772 --> 01:24:21,318
this big shambling oaf,
mute, filthy as a hog,

1490
01:24:21,402 --> 01:24:24,822
and he starts doing
this horrible little tap dance

1491
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:27,867
whilst singing "The Star-Spangled Banner."

1492
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:31,245
Well, not singing it, really,
but grunting it, like a caveman!

[laughing]

1495
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,919
You know,
he wants me to throw him some pennies,

1496
01:24:38,002 --> 01:24:39,962
so I fished a coin out of my pocket

1497
01:24:40,046 --> 01:24:42,048
and I guess I don't know my own strength.

1498
01:24:42,131 --> 01:24:45,760
I tossed it, hit him in the mouth,
and knocked his tooth out!

[laughing]

[mumbles] Mama.

In any event, I still have
one bottle left from that case.

1503

I'll go fetch it and we can drink a toast
to that awful woman and her hideous son.

I thought it was 15 grand a man.

What "what"?

What are you so surprised about?

Just so surprised at all the...

You know, I make that same face when
I put my cologne on in the morning,

You know what I think?

I think Don Don Diego isn't really
a coffee bean rancher at all.

And his true purpose here is to rob us.

If this is where the singing windmill is,
then why would they just up and leave?

1575
01:29:04,977 --> 01:29:08,397
Maybe that Stickie McSchnickens guy
was just pulling our leg.

1576
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,692
They went north...

Yeah, I hid it in my pants.
[stuttering] We'll give it back to ya!

[Left-Eye Boys shouting indistinctly]

1586
01:29:28,084 --> 01:29:30,627
Hey! Can you at least
help me pick these ants

1587
01:29:30,711 --> 01:29:33,339
out of my beard before you head out?

1588
01:29:33,422 --> 01:29:34,673
Please?

1589
01:29:34,756 --> 01:29:37,259
Tell you what,
we'll dig you up on one condition.

1590
01:29:37,343 --> 01:29:39,678
- [all exclaiming]
- You say it, we'll do it!

1591
01:29:39,761 --> 01:29:42,098
That you give up your lives of crime

1592
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:45,476
and take this second chance to start
doing good by people.

1593
01:29:45,559 --> 01:29:47,936
- I'd rather die!
- Hell, no! I ain't doing that!

1594
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:50,397
No way! Dumb Indian half!

1595
01:29:51,357 --> 01:29:52,691
That was a joke!
That was a joke!

1596
01:29:52,774 --> 01:29:55,069
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, Daddy!

1597
01:30:03,494 --> 01:30:05,496
[Ramon] Now what?
East or west?

1598
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:06,663
[Tommy] Whoa.

1599
01:30:19,218 --> 01:30:21,178
Late in the day.

1600
01:30:21,262 --> 01:30:23,847
Lot of traffic been going through here.

1601
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:25,516
It's going to take a minute.

1602
01:30:25,599 --> 01:30:28,644
Well, we must be getting mighty close.

1603
01:30:28,727 --> 01:30:31,813
They'd better be treating Dad well,
or they're gonna have to answer to us.

1604
01:30:31,897 --> 01:30:33,649
There he is.

1605
01:30:33,732 --> 01:30:35,026
- There's the man himself.
- [Herm grunting]

1606
01:30:35,109 --> 01:30:36,985
- Look at that handsome <i>hombre.</i>
- [Danny] Yeah.

1607
01:30:37,069 --> 01:30:39,196
- That's where we get our good looks.
- [chuckling]

1608
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,448
Let me see ol' Pop.

1609
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:56,088
[Ramon] Does he still
look like that, Tommy?

1610
01:30:57,173 --> 01:30:58,257
Tommy?

1611
01:30:59,216 --> 01:31:00,717
Yeah, he does.

1612
01:31:01,885 --> 01:31:04,513
Let's set up camp tonight.
Right out there.

1613
01:31:04,596 --> 01:31:05,931
But we can't waste any time.

1614
01:31:06,014 --> 01:31:09,185
Chico... I can't figure it out right now.

1615
01:31:09,268 --> 01:31:10,436
I gotta...

1616
01:31:10,519 --> 01:31:12,521
Just give me till sunrise.
Let me think.

1617
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:18,110
[snoring]

1618
01:31:42,426 --> 01:31:43,760
[Tommy] <i>Dear brothers,</i>

1619

1620

Meeting Betty Dunson...

01:33:00,086 --> 01:33:03,299
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

1635
01:33:05,467 --> 01:33:07,511
Mom was his biggest score.

Hyah.

1637
01:33:18,272 --> 01:33:19,273
[Cicero] Here we are.

1638
01:33:19,356 --> 01:33:21,650
We'd better not have come
all this way for nothing.

1639
01:33:21,733 --> 01:33:24,653
- I want the money, Frank.
- I know what you want.

1640

[Tommy] There's your money.

1641

Count it.

Oh, look who showed up.

1644
01:33:31,952 --> 01:33:35,372
I didn't know if somebody
dug up what you buried, Pa,

1645
01:33:35,456 --> 01:33:38,041
so I wanted to make sure
you were covered either way.

1646
01:33:38,124 --> 01:33:39,960
Thank you, son.

That's my boy.

Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

1650
01:33:46,049 --> 01:33:47,801
But, uh...

1651
01:33:47,884 --> 01:33:49,135
we'll be on our way.

1652
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:50,971
Not so fast.

1653
01:33:51,054 --> 01:33:54,099
You and me got some unfinished business.

1654
01:33:54,182 --> 01:33:56,393
No, our business is done.

1655

Yeah.

What, you mean...

1661
01:34:14,828 --> 01:34:16,538
my little horseshoe?

1662

That's always brought me luck.

1663
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,877
Especially when I was shooting somebody.

1664
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,171
Well, killer, your luck just ran out.

1665

Your hand touch that knife, boy,

1666
01:34:28,967 --> 01:34:31,345
it'll be the last thing you ever touch.

1667

Oh, I ain't using these knives.

1668

No.

Now you die, Injun-lover.

Fourteen of us, six of you.
Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?

1674
01:35:11,468 --> 01:35:13,804
Make that twelve of us.

- It's not working.
- What are you doing?

1680

Don't look like a tumbleweed at all, Herm.

Herm, come back!
Come back, Herm.

1682
01:36:06,773 --> 01:36:09,568
All right, all right.
Now, everybody just calm down.

1683

Plus... that's one less guy
you've got to split the money with!

You a prizefighter?

No, actually, I'm a...
piano player.

Do you like to play with the extra one?

Oh, you betcha.

Oh, Pa, I have a question for you.

01:38:58,403 --> 01:38:59,821
Yeah.

1742
01:38:59,905 --> 01:39:02,824
Where do babies come from?

1743
01:39:02,908 --> 01:39:06,537
Well, son, the mom just poops 'em out.

1744
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:10,081
[laughing] I knewed it!
I knewed it, Dad!

1745
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:13,877
Well, look at this handsome devil.

1746
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,421
Sir, I'm Danny.

1747
01:39:16,504 --> 01:39:18,549
It's awful nice to finally meet ya.

1748
01:39:18,632 --> 01:39:21,176
Could you help me with a problem?

1749
01:39:21,259 --> 01:39:23,219
I did a real stupid thing

1750
01:39:23,303 --> 01:39:27,891
that inadvertently led to the death
of a United States President,

1751
01:39:27,974 --> 01:39:32,020
and I'm feeling pretty lousy about it.

1752
01:39:33,689 --> 01:39:36,024
Well, son...

1753
01:39:36,107 --> 01:39:37,568
look in my eyes.

1754
01:39:39,861 --> 01:39:41,738
Shit happens.

1755
01:39:43,031 --> 01:39:44,783
Yeah.

1756
01:39:44,866 --> 01:39:47,118
- Yeah, right.
- [both chuckling]

1757
01:39:47,202 --> 01:39:49,495
Thanks. Thank you, sir.

1758
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:50,956
- [Frank] You're welcome.
- [exhales]

1759
01:39:51,039 --> 01:39:54,167
So, where to now, huh?

1760
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:57,796
Well, sir, Smoking Fox and me
are getting married in a few days,

1761
01:39:57,879 --> 01:40:01,132
and Screaming Eagle's
walking her down the aisle,

1762
01:40:01,216 --> 01:40:04,385
and I was hoping...

1763
01:40:04,469 --> 01:40:06,847
you could be there, next to me.

1764
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:09,641
Oh, you mean your best man?

1765
01:40:09,725 --> 01:40:11,142
Yes, sir.

1766
01:40:11,226 --> 01:40:13,019
Oh, Tommy...

1767
01:40:13,103 --> 01:40:15,731
You know, that's...
that's quite an honor.

1768
01:40:15,814 --> 01:40:18,358
- It would be my honor, sir.
- Yeah. Well, uh...

1769
01:40:19,943 --> 01:40:21,444
[clicks tongue]

1770
01:40:21,527 --> 01:40:24,530
But unfortunately, I...

1771
01:40:24,615 --> 01:40:27,993
I got some business up north
that I gotta attend to.

1772
01:40:28,076 --> 01:40:31,121
I gotta collect some gambling debts and...

1773
01:40:31,204 --> 01:40:34,916
You know,
just to pay the doctors and such.

1774
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,461
Say, Dad. You don't ever gotta worry
about money ever again.

1775
01:40:38,544 --> 01:40:41,256
We had to conjure up 50 grand twice!

1776
01:40:41,339 --> 01:40:43,299
So we ended up with 100!

1777
01:40:44,425 --> 01:40:45,665
- A hundred?
- [Tommy] Yes, sir.

1778
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:47,929
There's another 50 grand?

1779
01:40:48,013 --> 01:40:49,765
Yes, sir.

1780
01:40:49,848 --> 01:40:52,684
Right here,
in the burro's saddlebag.

1781
01:40:53,226 --> 01:40:57,898
So that business can wait up north,
can't it... best man?

1782
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:03,779
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I should change my plans.

1783
01:41:03,862 --> 01:41:06,531
<i>- Bueno. Bueno.</i> [laughs]
- [Frank] Yeah. [whistles]

1784
01:41:07,323 --> 01:41:08,909
[men shouting indistinctly]

1785
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,205
Hey! What are they doing back?

1786
01:41:20,378 --> 01:41:21,880
What is this?

1787
01:41:22,798 --> 01:41:25,550
I guess it's time you kids

1788
01:41:25,633 --> 01:41:30,263
learned the truth
about your dear old dad, huh?

1789
01:41:30,346 --> 01:41:33,809
I'm just too famous.

1790
01:41:33,892 --> 01:41:37,020
I can't walk into any town
west of the Rockies

1791
01:41:37,103 --> 01:41:39,856
without someone calling the law.

1792
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:44,319
So, I came up with a way
we could make 50 grand

1793
01:41:44,402 --> 01:41:46,487
without lifting a finger. [chuckles]

1794
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:50,450
And you rascals brought us double!

1795
01:41:50,533 --> 01:41:52,869
Are these my kids or what?

1796
01:41:52,953 --> 01:41:54,079
[laughing]

1797
01:41:54,162 --> 01:41:55,413
Son of a bitch!

1798
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:59,375
If our two gangs joined forces,

1799
01:41:59,459 --> 01:42:03,379
there's not a lawman in the West
that would stand up against us.

1800
01:42:03,463 --> 01:42:06,216
What makes you think we'd turn
to a life of crime?

1801
01:42:06,299 --> 01:42:08,218
'Cause it's in your blood.

1802
01:42:08,301 --> 01:42:10,261
Answer me something.

1803
01:42:10,345 --> 01:42:15,892
Were you ever great at anything
in your life besides stealing?

1804
01:42:17,728 --> 01:42:19,270
No. No.

1805
01:42:19,354 --> 01:42:23,191
You apples didn't fall far from this tree.

1806
01:42:23,274 --> 01:42:25,610
Don't deny who you are.

1807
01:42:25,693 --> 01:42:28,363
If you knew who we really were,

1808
01:42:28,446 --> 01:42:31,074
you'd be very scared right now.

1809
01:42:33,659 --> 01:42:36,287
Don't overplay your hand, son.

1810
01:42:37,873 --> 01:42:40,125
I'm still holding an ace.

1811
01:42:40,959 --> 01:42:41,960
[woman whimpering]

1812
01:42:49,509 --> 01:42:51,677
I found her. I...

1813
01:42:51,762 --> 01:42:53,221
I told you I'd find her.

1814
01:42:57,517 --> 01:43:02,022
This little beauty stumbled into our camp
a few days ago.

1815
01:43:02,856 --> 01:43:04,607
[chuckling]

1816
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:07,193
She actually tried to rescue me.

1817
01:43:07,277 --> 01:43:12,157
I'm guessing this means you don't want
me to be your best man no more, huh?

1818
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,993
[all laughing]

1819
01:43:15,076 --> 01:43:18,121
Well, I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

1820
01:43:19,414 --> 01:43:25,586
Hand over the other 50 grand...
in that stupid ass' saddlebag,

1821
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:31,009
or I put a bullet
in her pretty Apache head.

1822
01:43:33,929 --> 01:43:35,180
That ain't gonna happen.

1823
01:43:35,889 --> 01:43:37,223
Oh, it ain't?

1824
01:43:37,307 --> 01:43:38,599
No, sir.

1825
01:43:39,559 --> 01:43:40,811
Why's that?

1826
01:43:40,894 --> 01:43:43,771
Mmm... kind of a secret.

1827
01:43:43,855 --> 01:43:47,943
Well, you can tell your old man,
can't ya?

1828
01:43:48,026 --> 01:43:49,360
[snickers]

1829
01:43:50,904 --> 01:43:52,864
You know that bag...

1830
01:43:52,948 --> 01:43:55,366
- your boy's holding?
- Uh-huh.

1831
01:43:56,034 --> 01:43:57,828
It was meant for Cicero.

1832
01:43:57,911 --> 01:44:00,914
So there's something special in there.

1833
01:44:00,997 --> 01:44:03,458
- Plan B.
- Plan B?

1834
01:44:03,541 --> 01:44:04,709
[garbled] Plan B.

1835
01:44:04,792 --> 01:44:06,544
Give me that bag.

1836
01:44:09,881 --> 01:44:11,257

[gun clicks]

1847
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:09,065
- Danny, are you all right?
- [groaning]

1848
01:45:10,858 --> 01:45:13,778
You done good, Daniel.
You saved me.

1849
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:17,949
It's my duty, Mr. President.

1850
01:45:21,619 --> 01:45:23,079
Mrs. Lincoln.

1851
01:45:23,163 --> 01:45:24,455
[Smoking Fox struggling]

1852
01:45:24,539 --> 01:45:26,707

Come here.

[horse whinnying]

1855
01:45:31,712 --> 01:45:32,755
[Frank] Get in.

1856
01:45:38,594 --> 01:45:40,013

[Herm grunting]

01:45:53,901 --> 01:45:55,028
I got one!

1859
01:45:55,111 --> 01:45:56,696
Clem, you almost shot me!

1860

[man] Come on, get the horses!

1861

My ass! My ass!

1862
01:46:04,245 --> 01:46:05,746
Hey!

1863
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:09,292
Is this here still valid,
or is it too burnt up?

1864
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:10,918
Let me take a look here.

1865
01:46:11,002 --> 01:46:13,088
Uh, that looks good to me.
I mean, this looks good.

1866
01:46:13,171 --> 01:46:14,172
What in the hell?

1867
01:46:14,255 --> 01:46:16,716

What?

1871
01:46:23,389 --> 01:46:25,433
Did any of you really do it?

1872
01:46:30,563 --> 01:46:33,024
Well, then whose eyes are in that jar?

1873
01:46:33,108 --> 01:46:34,317
Uh...

1874
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,820
Well, Babyface found some rocks,
and, uh, painted them.

you wanna play a game

1880
01:46:56,714 --> 01:47:01,219
to make up for all the father-son time
we missed?

[laughter echoing]

1886
01:47:19,195 --> 01:47:21,906
You could have had everything, son.

1887
01:47:21,989 --> 01:47:24,659
But you had to do the right thing.

1888

[Frank chuckling]

1889

Let me leave you
with a bit of fatherly advice.

- Never bring a knife to a gunfight.
- [gun cocking]

there will be too many, my love.

[Smoking Fox] But not today.

1893

You knew Cicero killed my mother.

1897

No!

1898
01:48:12,415 --> 01:48:13,749
No, I didn't know that.

1899

No more lies!

1900
01:48:16,294 --> 01:48:18,671
Yeah, I knew. I knew.

1901
