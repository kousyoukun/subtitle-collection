纳森

61
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,750
可怜的纳森

纳森爱我，他尊重我
Nathan loves me, and Nathan respects me.

64
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,260
首先，男孩再尊重女孩 也不会放弃性爱
Okay. A, a guy never respects a girl enough to give up sex.

65
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,660
其次，你自己呢？
And, B, well, what about you?

66
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,730
你现在也情欲高涨了吧，黛娜

Okay, well, yeah, maybe, like, the tiniest bit,

68
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,670
但我真的觉得 我和上帝更接近了
but l really feel like l'm connecting with the higher power here.

69

我知道，那样很好

70
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,780
但是我做不到 我太喜欢吹萧了
but l know l couldn't do it. l'm way too into giving blow Jobs.

71
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,040
你问理查

72
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,750
嘿，别听伊茉珍的

性爱是重大决定 如果你觉得还没准备好
sex is a really big deal, and if you feel like you're not ready,

74
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,080
我认为你就该再等等
then l think you should wait.

75
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,850
但是...
DANA: But...

76
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,290
恕我直言，海蒂，但你不知道 自己在说什么
No offense, Heidi, but you have no idea what you're talking about.

77
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,530
再传简讯给我
Text me later.

78
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,370
- 嘿，罗伯 - 啥事？

79
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,970
- 可以问你一件事吗？ - 当然，什么事？
-Can l ask you something? -sure. What's up?

80
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,070
嗯，挺私人的事
Well, it's kind of personal.

81
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,510
好
Okay.

82
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,950
我一直在想 你知道我是处女吧？
l've been thinking. You know l'm a virgin, right?

83
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,360
只是...我不知道
lt's Just... l don't know.

84
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,760
大家好像都做过无数次了
Everyone's already done it like a million times already,

85
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,300
我知道我没有男朋友 但是...
and l know l don't have a boyfriend or whatever, but...

86
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,400
有时我觉得该克服此事
But sometimes l feel like l should Just get it over with.

87
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,670
我是说快点结束整件事，处女的事
You know? l mean, Just get past this whole thing, this virgin.

88
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,330
那到底有什么意义？
What does that even mean, anyway?

89
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,010
我的阴道没有小弟弟进去过 那又怎样？
so l've never had a penis in my vagina, but so what?

90
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,710
为何他们凡事就针对我？ 像是她太天真了
Why do l have to label everything? Like, ''she's too innocent.

91
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,810
“她无法应付的” 我没那么天真
''she can't handle it.'' l'm not that innocent.

92
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,580
我看过 《美国舞娘》 和 《蓝色珊瑚礁》
l've seen showgirls and Blue Lagoon.

93
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,250
总之，我决定要去做了 你觉得如何？
Anyways, l think l've decided to Just do it. But what do you think?

94
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,130

105
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,080
我不知道，邀她跳舞吧
l don't know. Ask her to dance, l guess.

106
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,600
你需要计划，好吗？ 这是要建立你的企图心
You need a plan, all right? lt's all about establishing your intentions.

107
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,770
现在她只当你是朋友
see, right now, she thinks of you as Just a friend.

108
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,610
你要打破这种形式
You need to break that paradigm.

109
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,350
记住，好朋友 不会让你和她只做普通朋友
Remember, friends don't let friends Just be friends.

110
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,260
- 好 - 我说真的，你不能退缩
-Right. -l'm serious. You cannot puss out here.

111
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,990
好啦，别激动 我过去找她聊聊
All right, take it easy. l'm gonna go talk to her.

112
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,090
等等，你是否忘了这个？
Wait. Aren't you forgetting something?

113
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,070
还有，别忘了这个
Here, don't forget these.

114
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,840
那是你没伴才会用到的
You only need those when you're alone.

115
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,400
好，好吧

118
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,650
- 但我才上二垒耶 - 我知道，但如果上了二垒

119
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,860
就会继续前进
then we're gonna wanna go further.

120
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,060
可是亚当和夏娃就做了
But Adam and Eve did it.

121

对不起，嘿

我以为你了解我的感受

l told you, it's important for me to save myself until marriage.

你上过七个男人了
You've had sex with seven guys.

128
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,170
只有六个，不是七个！
And it was six, not seven!

129
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,100
其中一个是黑人 因此他可以抵上两个人
Well, one was a black guy, so he counts as two.

130
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,600
黛娜
Dana.

131
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,170
- 黛娜 - 去死啦

我把这个丢给辣妹
l throw this at a hot girl,

150
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,860
她绝对忘不了 我朝她丢了张百元大钞
and she's so impressed that l'm literally throwing around a BenJamin

151
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,250
所以她会和我上床
that she wants to hook up with me.

152

161
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,880

-Yeah, maybe. -Dana's pissed at me.

172
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,320
你必须忍耐这整个守贞的事
Dude, you gotta play along with this whole pledge thing.

173
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,950
你说得倒容易
Well, that's easy for you to say.

174

你也还没破处男之身啊
You haven't exactly broken the seal yet, either.

175
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,290
老兄，我上三垒都已经习以为常了
Dude, l've been getting to third base on a regular basis.

176
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,560
不能回头再去打手枪
l can't go back to Jacking off now.

177
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,690
老兄，改用你的左手 感觉会完全不一样

老兄，你真是电灯泡啊

这里到底怎么了？
What the hell is going on in here?

200
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,100
连续两个月周六留校 似乎太长了
Two months seems like an awfully long time for saturday detention.

201
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,340
我们要打扫图书馆
We're supposed to clean up the library.

202
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,970
你们知道吸尘器放哪了？
Do you guys know where the vacuum is?

203
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,600
不知
Nope.

204
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,680
你到底去图书馆做什么？

209
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,230
妈，我不懂为何处罚我 我又没做什么
Mom, l don't see what that has to do with it. l didn't do anything.

210
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,460
我听说你是负责助性的

罗伯？ 我想和你聊聊
Rob? l wanna have a little chat with you.

216
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,250

我不知道你爸有没有教你

but l think it's important to discuss everything, you know?

220
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,560

''2003. l Just had the most amazing sexual experience.''

262
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,520
有些烧坏了看不到 “她用了口腔芳香剂”
something l can't read. ''she used a breath mint.''

263
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,620
口腔芳香剂？ 干嘛用的？
A breath mint? For what?

264
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,590
笨蛋，你让她把那个 伸进你的小菊花，超刺激的
You moron. You stick it up your tailpipe and the minty-ness makes your asshole twitch.

265
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,560
大家都知道啊
Everyone knows that.

266
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,360
天啊，我不知道，这个似乎很怪
Dude, l don't know. This sounds pretty weak.

267
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,030
况且这些绝大多数 网路就找得到了
Plus, l mean, we can find most of this stuff on the internet anyway.

268
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,900
不，这不一样 里面有个人的经验
No, this is different. This has personal experiences.

269
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,410
况且是针对东瀑女孩 量身撰写的
Plus, it's custom-tailored to Great Falls girls.

270
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,310
曾几何时 连阴道都有邮递区号了？
since when does punani have a zip code?

271
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,470
我们有什么损失？ 纳森 你一直想搞定黛娜，多久了？
What have we got to lose? Nathan, you've been working on Dana for, what?

272
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,420
六个月了吧？ 结果只发现 她爱上帝胜过做爱
Like six months? Only to find out that she loves the Lord more than sex?

273
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,550
还有你，路伯 你那些做爱计划有效吗？
And, Lube, how have all your schemes to get laid been working out so far?

274
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,750
损失了一百元
Minus $100.

275
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,560
没错，至于我 我一直在幻想有一天
Exactly, and me, well, l've been wasting all my time on some fantasy that someday

276
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,830
海蒂将会爱上我 面对现实吧，各位，我们需要帮助
Heidi's gonna fall madly in love with me. Face it, guys, we need help.

277
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,430
就是这个，答案就在我们面前
And this is it, staring us right in the face.

278
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,010
- 我加入 - 好耶
-l'm in. -All right.

279

282
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,870
轻点，这书很旧了
Hey, easy. Guys, it's old.

283
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,640
1990年5月1日
''May 1st, 1990.

284
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,850
“钻进女生裤子 最简单的方法还是吹捧”
''The simplest way into a girl's pants is still basic flattery.''

285
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,860
就这样？ 只要捧她？
That's it? Just flatter her?

286
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,890
- 就是这样 - 嗯，想一想
-That's it. -Well, think about it.

287
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,990
你真正捧过她几次？
How many times do you actually do it?

288
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,100
走过去对女孩说 “哇，你的眼睛真美”
Walk up to a girl and say, ''Wow, you have beautiful eyes.''

289
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,970
从来没有，它教导我们 把女人的唯一方法是当笨蛋
Like, never. lt's telling us the only proven way to get women is to be an asshole,

290
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,300
因为会说这些话的男人 才把得到妹
'cause the guys that actually spew that kind of crap get laid.

291
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,810
注意看，十二点钟方向
Check it out. Twelve o'clock.

292
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,480
- 好，来测试一下这本宝典 - 好
-All right. Let's put this bible to a test. -Yes.

293
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,480
- 你去搭讪 - 我不要拿爱西莉做测试
-You go talk to her. -l'm not trying it out on Ashley.

294
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,610
你为什么不去？ 你才是喜欢她的那个人
Why don't you go talk to her, 'cause you're the one who likes her?

295
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,190
- 我在吃东西 - 好，我去
-l'm eating. -Okay. l'll do it.

296
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,980
嘿，爱西莉
Hey, Ashley.

297
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,120
嘿，罗伯，买礼物给女朋友？

300
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,380
我...事实上我只想说

你的牙齿真的好漂亮
you know, you have the most gorgeous teeth.

302
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,690
嘿，跟我来
Hey. Come with me.

303
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,090
吃醋吗？ 他对你的梦中情人 采取行动了
Jealous? He's making a move on your lady friend.

304
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,870
我不像你，我不介意分享女人
Unlike you, l don't mind sharing my women.

305
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,200
你们两个白痴在干嘛？
(LAUGHs) And what are you wankers up to today?

306
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,870
- 哈罗 - 嗨，亲爱的

问候你老妈
Word to your mumsie.

308
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,280
只是等几个女孩加入我们
Just waiting for some ladies to Join us, in fact.

309
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,010
就算握有一叠 强纳斯兄弟演唱会的后台通行证
You nancy boys couldn't get laid at a Jonas Brothers concert

310
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,710
你们两个孬种也把不到女孩，再见喽
with a fistful of backstage passes. Cheerio.

311
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,060
她在侮辱人吗？
(lN NORMAL ACCENT) Was that a slam?

312
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,860
当然啊，笨鸟蛋
(lN NORMAL ACCENT) You bet your bollocks.

313
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,690

走出专柜，到美食街和我会合

我能帮忙吗？

00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,780
不，我...随便逛逛

- 祝你今天顺心 - 你也一样
-Have a nice day. -You, too.

l'm sorry! l wasn't stealing. lt was a... lt was a prank.

326

l am so sorry. l think we left the tags on your garments.

请回到柜台 我会弄好的，真不好意思
Please come back to the register. We'll figure this out. l'm so embarrassed.

328

That'll be 1 49.90.

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,230
- 多少？ - 149.90元
-How much? -1 49.90.

332
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,000
那么小件耶
But they're so small.

333
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,610
- 玛德莲？ - 是我妈的，我...她批准的
-Madeleine? -lt's my mom. l'm... l have a note.

欢迎再度光临
Come again.

336
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,840
你怎么那么久？ 拿到没？
What took you so long? Did you get it?

337
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,900
当然，我还偷了袋子 这样你就能拎着回家
sure did. l even stole you a bag so you don't have to touch it till you get home.

338
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,750
真好，谢谢
Great. Thanks.

339
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,210
嘿，你好吗？ 爱西莉
Hey. What's up, Ashley?

340
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,250
你们这些娘炮来干嘛？
What are you pillow biters doing here?

341
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,620
史提弗
stifler.

342
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,220
别吃那个，你会变胖
Don't eat that. You're gonna get fat.

343
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,460
我好想来一发 到电器行来帮我吹？
l'm super horny. Wanna suck me off in the sharper lmage?

344
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,250
好啊
Okay.

345
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,740
黛娜，对不起，我很抱歉
(WHlsPERlNG) Dana. Excuse me. l'm so sorry.

346
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,580
我无意打断这... 这个晨间弥撒
Didn't mean to disrupt the... This morning's mass.

347
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,620
你来干什么？
(WHlsPERlNG) What are you doing here?

348
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,550
我想向你道歉
l wanted to say l'm sorry.

349
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,950
现在不适合讨论这个吧？
Did you really think that this is the best time to discuss this?

350
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,030
你不肯回我简讯
Well, you weren't answering any of my texts.

351
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,890
- 我马上回来，好吗？ - 好
-l'll be right back, okay? -(WHlsPERlNG) Okay.

352
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,870
信心是什么？
PRIEsT ON PA.; what is faith?

353
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,640
当你打开厨房的电灯开关
when you flip the light switch in your kitchen,

354
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,140
你知道电灯会亮
you know that the light will turn on.

355
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,670
有人说这就是信心 但我告诉你，这不是真正的信心
some might call that faith, but I tell you, that is not the real faith.

356
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,910
好，什么事那么重要 非要过来打断我听道？
Okay, so what is so important that you needed to come and interrupt church?

357
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,680
我不懂你现在为何那么气我
l don't really get why you're so mad at me right now.

358
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,880
因为你不尊重我 你觉得这一切是个大笑话
Because you don't respect me. This is all Just a big Joke to you.

359
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,580
你说得对，因为这只是 你的另一个阶段
You know what? You're right, because this is Just another phase for you.

360
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,180
就像你年鉴上的声明
Just like your little stint on yearbook.

361
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,750
你能坚守多久 两个星期就腻了？
You stuck with that for, what, two weeks before you got bored with it?

362
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,300
你为何就不能相信 我要等到
Why is it so hard for you to believe that l wanna

363
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,770
结婚之后才有性生活？
(ON PA) wait until marriage?

364
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,290
因为你同一个晚上 睡过道格惠勒和史考特汤姆森
NATHAN ON PA.; Because you slept with Doug wheeler and scott Thompson on the same night.

365
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,430
那不算，我喝醉了
DANA.; That doesn't count. I was drunk.

366
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,630
那是黛娜？
(WHlsPERlNG) ls that Dana?

367
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,870
等你对守贞的事厌烦了
As soon as you get bored with this whole pledge thing,

368
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,510
你又会立刻大干特干
you're just gonna jump right back in the saddle again.

369
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,710
等你上大学以后，别告诉我
And when you get to college, don't even tell me

370
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,650
你不会想试试 标准的女同性爱
that you won't be experimenting with the standard lesbian hookups,

371
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,020
3P性爱、走后门等等
having three-ways, trying anal.

372
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,310
- 耶 - 耶
-Yeah. -Yeah.

373
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,720
- 我就说嘛... - 好，别激动
That's what l'm talking... (LAUGHs NERVOUsLY) Fine. Just relax.

374
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,920
- 想点办法！ - 信心是...
-Do something! -PRIEsT.; Faith is...

375
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,430
- 她是你女儿 - 快去！
-she's your daughter. -Go!

376
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,160
信心如磐石...
PRIEsT.; Faith is the rock-solid...

377
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,230
你认为我做不到？ 我爸妈就守到新婚之夜
DANA.; You don't think I'm committed to this? My parents waited until marriage.

378
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,400
我爸和你妈一起上高中
NATHAN.; (LAUGHs) My dad went to high school with your mom.

379
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,990
他说她帮整个足球队吹过
He said she blew the whole football team

380
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,040
吹到必须去洗胃
and had to have her stomach pumped.

381
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,600
少恶心了，行吗？
DANA.; Don't be gross, okay?

382
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,170
况且你爸是兄弟会的
Plus, your dad was a Beta.

383
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,270
那些家伙超爱办事的
Those guys are notorious poon slayers.

384
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,980
去你的！ 全是胡扯！
Fuck it! This is bullshit!

385
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,290
你知道你想要的
You know you want this.

386
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,350
我们错过圣餐了？
Did we miss communion?

387

-He's up. -No, no. Why am l first?

536
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,130
是你的主意
NATHAN: lt was your idea.

537
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,330
不...别侮辱莫妮 宝典有一整章都在讲她
Don't... Don't insult Monique. she has an entire chapter in the bible.

541
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,300
不，还不用

你的想像力很丰富，孩子
You've got one active imagination, boy.

544
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,980
我晃神多久了？
How long was l out?

545

大概八秒钟而已
Only about eight seconds that time.

546
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,970
我的阴阜 阴道润滑剂


547
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,830
不、不行、不行
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. No, no, no.

548
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,430

Yes. Yes.

549
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,440
莫妮！ 真是太棒了
ROB: Monique! That's really nice.

550
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,430
就是这样
ROB: That's it.

551
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,130
抱歉，我平常可以更久一点

哦，不好了
Oh, no. No.

- 天啊 - 我的天！
-Jesus. Dude. -Oh, God!

558
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,060
你需要观众啊？
What, do you need an audience?

559
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,430
不，等一下，我想她死了！
No, no. Wait, guys. l think she's dead!

560
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,560
你说什么？
Excuse me?

561
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,430
我的天，这可不妙
Oh, my God. This is not good.

562
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,130
我无法拉开她 她应该是心脏病发
l can't get her off. l think she had a heart attack.

563
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,300
救命啊！ 她咬紧我了，快弄开她！
Help! she's got lockJaw. Get her off of me!

564
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,640
- 我的天 - 她牙关紧闭
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. -lt's lockJaw.

565
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,740
牙关紧闭！ 牙关紧闭
LockJaw! LockJaw, lockJaw, lockJaw, lockJaw, lockJaw!

566
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,780
- 好 - 弄开她！
-Okay. -Get her off!

567
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,220
对不起！
l'm sorry!

568
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,950
电话，等等，退后！
Phone. Phone. Wait. Clear!

569
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,560
可恶，我在干嘛？
shit. What am l doing?

570
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,530
后退、后退！
Clear, clear!

571
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,160
好，蹲下来 抓住她的腿，一、二、三
Okay. Come down here. Grab her legs. One, two, three.

572
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:55,300
全搞砸了，天啊
Forget it. lt's totally screwed up. Oh, God.

573
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,620
你对妈妈怎么了？
What you do to maman?

574
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:12,960
妈妈！ 你杀了妈妈！ 你杀了妈妈！
(CRYING) Maman! You killed maman! You killed maman!

575
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:35,170
死美国佬！ 给我回来 我要杀了你们！ 懦夫！
Fucking Americans! Come back here. l'll kill you! l'll kill you, you cowards!

576
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,090
我杀了她
ROB: l killed her.

577
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,950
我用精子杀了她！
l killed her with my sperm!

578
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,120
嘿，生死有命 她也活得够精彩了
Hey, man, when it's your time to go, it's your time to go. she led a full life.

579
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,220
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

580
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,590
不然你要我说什么？ 人是你杀的耶！
Man, what do you want me to say? You're the one that murdered her!

581
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,260
我不敢相信宝典记载 我们应该和她做爱
l can't believe that was the woman the bible said we should have sex with.

582
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,860
就在这里 “1995年9月9日”
Right here. ''september 9th, 1995.''

583
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,400
让我看看
Let me see that.

584
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,110
不，那是7！ 是1975年，70年代的事了
No. No, that's a seven! That's 1975. lt's from the '70s.

585
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,740
- 我以为那是9 - 闭嘴！ 闭嘴！
-l thought it was a nine. -NATHAN: shut up! shut up!

586
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,450
- 我什么也没做！ - 闭嘴！ 我要回家
-l didn't do anything! -shut up! Just shut up! l wanna go home.

587
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,180
我不要待在这里
l don't wanna be here.

588
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,190
天啊！ 我撞到一只松鼠
(THUDs) Oh, my God! l Just hit a squirrel.

589
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,990
还真不顺利
LUBE: Well, that went well.

590
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,660
各位，我想该试试我的解读了
ROB: Guys, l think it's time we try my interpretation.

591
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,860
听着，纳森 你一直想求黛娜和你上床
Look, Nathan, you've been trying to convince Dana to sleep with you,

592
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,130
但你没有认真听她讲话 你懂吗？
instead of Just listening to her. Right, you know?

593
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,230
你试过从她的观点看吗？ 表现出...
Trying to see things from her point of view? showing Just...

594
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,330
一点尊重
Just a little respect.

595
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,350
还有你，你还想用花招 骗女人和你上床
And you, you're still trying to trick women into sleeping with you,

596
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,480
你从来不坦白
instead of Just being honest.

597
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,280
你还是太孬种 不敢告诉海蒂你喜欢她
And you're still too much of a pussy to tell Heidi you're into her.

598
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,780
图书馆入口


599
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,690
你晚上要去史提弗他家？
You going to stifler's house tonight?

600
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,170
对，也许和黛娜一起去
Yeah. l'll probably go with Dana.

601
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,830
所以你摆脱掉处女的事了没？
so any luck losing that thing you were trying to get rid of?

602
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,300
- 罗伯 - 只是问问嘛
-Rob. -l'm Just asking.

603
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,540
也许你管好自己就行了
Maybe you should mind your own business.

604
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,510
你今天怎么搞的？
What's with you today?

605
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,960
我想告诉你 一些我很早就想讲的事
l wanna tell you something that l've been wanting to say for a long time.

606
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,520

607
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,340
我真的很喜欢你
l really like you.

608
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,660
我也喜欢你
l really like you, too.

609
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,540
不，不是那样，我真的喜欢你
No, not like that. l really like you.

610
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,680
- 罗伯... - 我认为你很棒
-Rob... -l think you're great.

611
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,490
你个性很好 你的笑话常逗我笑，你很漂亮
You have a great personality. l laugh at all your Jokes. You're pretty.

612
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,290
天啊，你好漂亮，闻起来好香
Oh, God, you're pretty. You even smell great.

613
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,160
我不知道，我只是... 有你在身边我就很开心
l don't know. l'm Just... l'm happy when l'm around you.

614
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,100
不知你有没有相同感觉 但如果你有...
Now, l don't know if you feel the same way, but if you do...

615
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,600
让我们别浪费时间了，好吗？
Let's not waste any more time. Right? Let's Just

616
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,640
我们就来交往看看
see where our feelings take us.

617
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,450
我也有相同感觉
l feel the same way.

618
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,370
- 真的？ - 对
-You do? -Yes.

619
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,680
这太棒了，你为何都不说？
This is great. Why didn't you say something?

620
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,650
你怎么不说？
Why didn't you?

621
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:33,430
是时候了，我该走了 今晚能见到你？
lt's about that time, so l gotta go. But l'll see you tonight?

622
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,750
好
Yes.

623
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,680
爸？
-DANA: Dad? -Mmm-hmm?

624
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,620
她在那里
There she is.

625
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,860
他们看到我了！ 快伏低！
(GAsPlNG) They saw me! Get down! Get down!

626
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,730
- 我的天啊 - 快开车
-Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. -Drive. Drive.

627
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,600
没事，没事
lt's cool. lt's cool.

628
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,770
纳森，我一直在想
Nathan, look, l've been thinking.

629
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,000
也许我对你太严厉了
Maybe l've been too hard on you.

630
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,980
你吗？
You have?

631
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,880
你显然爱我女儿 你们两个应该在一起
You obviously love my daughter, and you two should be together.

632
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,410
- 我们应该？ - 当然
-We should? -Absolutely.

633
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,390
亲爱的，你不该让男人硬忍着
Honey, it is not right to give a man blue balls.

634
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:42,770
想要男孩喜欢你，就要开放点 先从纳森的朋友开始
lf you want boys to like you, you gotta put out. Here, start with Nathan's friend.

635
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,140
这太逊了
This is so not cool.

636
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,810
对你麻吉的女朋友 心存幻想？
l mean, fantasizing about your best friend's girlfriend?

637
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,380
我的天！
(sCREAMlNG) Oh, my God!

638
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,480
- 爸！ 住手！ - 该死！
-Dad! stop! stop. -Fucknut!

639
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,350
好耶，女孩们
All right, girls.

640
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,080
- 派对看来不错 - 对
-Party looks good. -Yeah.

641
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,950
好了，注意听我说
All right, listen to me. stay focused.

642
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,420
要诚实，要懂得尊重 心里有话就说出来
Be honest, show respect and Just say whatever's on your mind.

643
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,360
少来，混蛋
stop, Jerk.

644
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,660
我甚至无法靠近黛娜
l can't even get near Dana.

645
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,160
她会来的，和海蒂一起来
she'll be here. she's coming with Heidi.

646
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:49,790
试着从她的观点来看
Just try and think of things from her point of view.

647
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,600
对，我努力看圣经 顺便破解达文西密码
Yeah, and l might as well Just crack the Da Vinci Code while l'm at it.

648
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,690
给她乳香和没药就行了
Just get her some frankincense and myrrh.

649
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,830
真是好主意
That's a great idea.

650
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,240
我出去顺便帮你买些强暴丸
l'll Just pick up some roofies for you while l'm out.

651
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:01,540
就我所知，你必须有处方笺
You need a prescription for that, from what l hear.

652
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,550
路伯，注意点，你也一样啦
Lube, pay attention. This applies to you, too.

653
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,610
好，我们进去吧 试着忠于自我
All right. Let's try to go in there and Just be real.

654
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,450
好的，欧普拉
All right, Oprah.

655
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,440
嘿，那不是中央高中的辣妹？
Hey. lsn't that that chick from Central?

656
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,580
对

657
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,410
嘿，史提弗

00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,550
凯蒂，对，我知道 只是逗你玩玩
Katie, right. l knew that. Just having some fun with you.

661
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,620
我可以私下和你谈谈吗？
Can l talk to you for a second, like, in private?

662
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,420
当然，这样吧？
Yeah, sure, you know what?

663
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,490
我再去拿罐啤酒 马上就回来找你
Let me Just grab another beer and l'll be right back with you.

664
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,430
别抛下我哦
Don't you flake on me.

665
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,570
老兄，你有在运动吗？ 我看没有哦
Dude, you been working out? Didn't think so.

666
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,140
你们两个，还是超酷，天啊
You two, stay amazing. My God.

667
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,170
你好吗？ 美女
Hey, what's up, beautiful?

668
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,180
我上星期醉到不行
You know, l got so drunk last weekend

669
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,680
竟然把小鸡鸡钉在桌上 然后拿它起火
that l nailed my cock to a table, then set it on fire.

670
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,580
想看一下吗？
Wanna check it out?

671
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,620
看桌子还是鸡鸡？
The table or your cock?

672
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,790
天啊，我爱你的口音
God, l love that accent.

673
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,690
拜托你说一下
Could you do me a favor and Just say,

674
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,590
“打我屁股，史提弗 轻轻打我的小屁股”
''spank me, stifler. spank me wee little bum.''

675
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,530
你怎么知道我爱这一套？
How did you know l like to be spanked?

你一直挂在嘴边的男朋友 那个理查人呢？
so where's this boyfriend Richard you keep talking about non-stop all the time?

678
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,230
他不参加高中派对
He doesn't attend high-school parties.

679
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,870
看来你对美国的牛肉棒 很有兴趣
sounds like you might be in the market for some home-grown American beef.

680
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,850
抱歉，我吃素

干杯
Cheers.

682
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,020
如果我改成小黄瓜呢？
What if l use a cucumber?

683
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,820
好，各位，就是今晚了 祝我好运

686
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,960
没错，今晚我要开荤了！
That's it. Tonight, l'm getting laid!

687
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,290
- 耶，兄弟！ - 好耶，兄弟

688
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,800
- 对！ - 就在今夜
-Yes! -Right here.

689
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,840
一开始先慢慢来

然后做快一点

691
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,600
黛娜！
Dana!

692
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,770
黛娜！
Dana!

693
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,570
耶！
Yeah!

694
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,330
- 什么？ - 错了
-What? -sorry.

695
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,390
- 我找不到海蒂 - 也许她没来
-l can't find Heidi anywhere. -Maybe she didn't come.

696
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,580
不，她的车在外面
No, no. Her car is outside.

697
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,850
你的进展如何？
How you making out?

698
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,560
你看看
Check it out.

699
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,690
你不觉得 爱西莉和你搭不在一起？
Don't you think maybe Ashley's Just a little bit out of your league?

700
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:55,000
我不知道，我只是说说 你试过好几年了
l don't know. l'm Just saying, you know, you've been at it for years.

701
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,470
也许她不是你的真命天女
Maybe it's Just not in the cards for you.

702
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,010
我是很讲究的人
l'm a man of refinement.

703
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,340
能找到十分的女孩 为何要屈就六分的？
Why settle for a six when you can get a perfect 10?

704
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,580
好，随便你，祝你好运
Okay, whatever you say, man. Good luck.

705
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,220
好，我要行动了
Right. l'm gonna do it.

706
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,780
嘿，你好吗？ 爱西莉

710
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,020

你显然知道 我对你非常着迷吧？
You obviously know that l'm, like, totally into you. Right?

713
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,180
对，我早就知道了

714
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,800
好吧
All right.

715
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,480
所以我就老实说了 我决定有话直说
Okay, so l'm Just gonna be honest with you. l'm Just gonna lay it out on the line.

716
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,080
不耍花招，没有隐瞒
No tricks, no hidden agenda at all.

717
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,620
我刚好是敏感老练的爱人
l happen to be a sensitive and expert lover.

718
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:56,130
我保证满足你各方面的需求
l can guarantee that l will satisfy you in every way possible,

719
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,430
除非你满意我的努力
and l shall not stop until l'm certain

720
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,800
否则我绝对不会停止
that you are completely happy with my endeavors.

721
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,670
好吧
Okay.

722
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:20,750
听着，很有趣的告白
Look, that was a really interesting speech,

723
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:24,960
我真的不想当众给你难堪，但...
and l don't really wanna embarrass you in front of everyone, but...

724
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,660
我们是不可能的
But it's not gonna happen.

725
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:31,220
我知道你超酷的
l mean, l think that you're, like, really super cool,

726
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,130
你在班上真的很风趣
and you're really funny in class and everything,

727
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,970
但我不想和你上床
but l don't wanna have sex with you.

728
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,310
好吗？
Okay?

729
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,280
嗯，当然喽

731
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:45,640
好的
All right.

732
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,310
我要再来罐啤酒，你要吗？
Well, l'm gonna go get another beer. Do you want one?

733
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:50,050
不，我...我有啤酒了
No, no. l'm... l'm good. l'm good.

734
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,690
- 嘿 - 嘿
-Hey. -Hey.

735
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,030
你刚刚说什么？
(CLEARs THROAT) What you said Just now?

736
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,430
啥？
Yeah?

737
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,400
那是真的吗？
Was that true?

738
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:09,130
保证女孩满意了 不然你保证不会停？
Guaranteed satisfaction and you won't stop until a girl is completely satisfied?

739
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,760
对

740
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,710
好啊，管它的

00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,650
到楼上和我会合 左边第一间卧室
Meet me upstairs in the first bedroom to the left.

742
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:30,320
我和艾咪在一起 我要上床了！


743
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,700
老实说，对 我想对你施压
NATHAN: The truth is, yes, l was trying to pressure you,

744
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,530
因为我真的很想做爱
because l really, really wanna have sex.

745
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,700
但我真正想要的 是和你做爱
But l really wanna have sex with you.

746
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,540
同时，我们在一起 总是谈到我的需要
And, also, l mean, with us, hooking up has always been about me.

747
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,980
这次我想忘了自己 试着改变，先让你觉得舒服
l wanna forget myself for once and try to make you feel good for a change.

748
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:59,010
也许试着让你感受到 你所给我的感觉
Like, maybe try and make you feel the way that you make me feel.

749
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,310
你不该...你不该... 那是我的手机
You shouldn't... You shouldn't... lt's my phone.

750

别看我的手机
Don't read my phone.

751
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:32,410
这是什么意思？ “和她疯狂大干吧” ？
What's this supposed to mean? ''Give her a dose of manthrax''?

752
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,650
我不知...那...
Well, l don't... What does that...

753

我不知道那是... 你懂它的意思？
l don't know what that... Do you know what that means?

754
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,590
“我要上床了” ？
''l'm getting laid''?

755
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,190
事情还没发生 你就大肆宣传起来？
You're advertising this before it even happens?

756
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,250
- 不是 - 哇
-No. -Wow.

757

766
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,760
- 我的左边还是你的？ - 我的！

767
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,390

Hey, doggy style. l told you, you snooze, you lose.

773
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,470
除非你要执勤扫荡 关上门啦，变态
so unless you want mop-up duty, close the door, pervert.

774
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,320
嘿，你要去哪里？
sTlFLER: Hey, where are you going?

775

778
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,440
- 滚开 - 我没有...
-Go away. -l didn't. l...

779
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,140
我现在不想看到你
l don't wanna see your face right now.

780
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,580
罗伯
Rob.

781
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,460
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

782
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,670
你不是要忘了自己 先让我舒服吗？
What happened to forgetting about yourself and making me feel good?

783
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,140
但我以为刚刚...
But l thought l Just...

784
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,730
什么？ 你以为什么？ 纳森
What? You thought that what, Nathan?

785
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:39,140
你可以假装在乎我的感觉 以及我的守贞
That you could Just pretend that you cared about my feelings and my pledge

786
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,150
等我疏于防备 你好再试一次看看？
and then Just go and try again when my guard was down?

787
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,550
不，你不了解，我...
No. You don't get it. l...

788
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,650
不，你才不了解，你得不到的
No. No, you're the one that's not gonna get it.

789
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,060
老兄，你要放慢脚步
Dude, you need to slow down.

790
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,430
对，说真的，我们回家吧
Yeah, seriously. Let's Just go home.

791
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,030
你这位先生... 宝典的事你说对了
You, sir... You, sir, were right about the bible.

792
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:10,740
因为混蛋才能上床搞！
Because assholes get laid!

793
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,340
对
Yes.

794
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,350
不，老兄，你是对的
No. No, no, dude. You were right.

795
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,880
- 里面有些道理的 - 你在说什么？
-There's something to it. -What are you talking about?

796
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,580
我们试过当好人了 我相信我们都还是处男
We tried the nice guy thing and l believe we're all still virgins.

797
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:28,060
当好人差点让我上床成功呢
Well, the nice guy vibe got me past the bouncer, man.

798
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,250
嘿
Hey.

799
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:40,330
各位先生，你们输了 证明就在果冻中
Well, gentlemen, you failed, and the proof, as they say, is in the Jell-o.

800
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,830
我们晚点见，好人
so l will see you later, nice guys.

801
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,480
- 嘿 - 嘿
-Hey. -Hey.

802
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,340
我知道你要我
l know you want me.

803
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,880
我愿意和你上楼 让你大干一场
l'm gonna let you take me upstairs and do me right now.

804
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,120
- 真的？ - 对
-Really? -Yeah.

805
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,020
吻我
Kiss me.

806
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,090
想来点痛苦的吗？
sTlFLER: Y'all ready for some pain?

807
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,510
小姐们
Hey, ladies.

808
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,280
我的天
GlRL: Oh, my God.

809
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,280
天啊！
sTlFLER: Oh, my God!

810
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,720
看看她们的咪咪！
Look at those taters!

811
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,230
从后面上我
Do me from behind.

812
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,130
什么？
What?

813
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,760
我以为你喜欢狗爬式
l thought you liked it doggy style.

814
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,840
你以为你在干什么？

815
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,800
你杵在后面干嘛？ 快点啊
What are you doing back there? Let's go.

816
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,140
你不会把小鸡鸡放进去吧？
You're not putting your dick in that, are you?

817
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,050
你开啥玩笑？ 太恶心了
Are you kidding me? Gross.

818
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,910
给你，这会舒服点
Here. This'll help.

819
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,570
谢了
Thanks.

820
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,550
儿子，我知道我无法阻止你 去做某些事情
Honey, l know that l can't stop you from doing certain things,

821
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,820
但我坚持你要注意安全
but l can insist that you are safe.

822
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,950
你喝酒又开车吗？
Did you drink and drive?

823
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,550
没有，约翰卡特罗载我回家
No. John Costello drove me home.

824
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:44,360
我要告诉你 如果你要和人发生关系
Well, l want you to know that if you find yourself in any carnal situation,

825
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,990
你...要做好保护措施
that you... You will use protection.

826
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,500
你在说什么？
What do you mean by carnal?

827
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,700
这个
This.

828
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,080
你开啥玩笑？ 太恶心了
(GROANs) GIRL.; Are you kidding me? Gross.

829
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,240
现在都没隐私了吗？
ls there no such thing as privacy anymore?

830
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,080
我会告诉你爸爸 你今天不能起床见他
l will tell your father that you're Just not up to seeing him today.

831
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,090
你身体不舒服
You're not feeling well.

832
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,480
谢谢
Thanks.

833
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,660
她怎样啊？
How was she?

834
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,060
- 谁怎样？ - 呕吐女孩
-How was who? -Vomit girl.

835
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:20,360
你怎么知道的？
How do you know about that?

836
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,770
不然你以为是谁 把短片寄给老妈？
Who do you think is forwarding all those videos to Mom?

837
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,540
我准备放弃了
ROB: l'm ready to give up.

838
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,180
我以为我有答案的
l thought l had the answers.

839
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,940
可惜宝典有九成九都看不清楚了
lt's too bad that 99% of the bible's completely unreadable.

840
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,580
就是这样
That's it.

841
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,120
我们必须重建宝典
We need to reconstruct the bible.

842
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,180
为什么？
Why?

843
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,690
秘密都在里面
The secrets are in there.

844
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,730
想上床没有单一解答
l mean, there's no one single answer to getting laid.

845
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,760
对吧？ 我们必须了解 整本书的内容
Right? We need the whole book to understand.

846
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,920
或许里面还有很多 我们必须知道的东西
Probably has a lot of crap in there that we need to know, too,

847
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,990
像姿势、技巧、插入角度
like positions, techniques, angle of insertion.

848
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:59,300
没错，宝典的作用就在这里 帮助像我们这样的人
Exactly. That's what the bible was created for, to help guys like us.

849
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,600
我们欠大家一个交待 我毁了宝典
And we owe it to the others. l ruined the bible.

850
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,470
这是我欠未来新生代的 我要重拾智慧
l owe it to future generations to restore its wisdom.

851
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,310
老兄，我愿意帮忙，但要怎么做？
Dude, l'm all for it, but how?

852
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,220
从哪里开始？
Where do we start?

853
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,760
从最初开始
From the beginning.

854
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,990
这一定是宝典的原创者
LUBE: This must be the guy who created the bible.

855
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,190
诺亚雷文斯坦 1969年11月6日


856
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:28,360
哈罗？
Hello?

857
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,340
嗨，我找诺亚雷文斯坦？
ROB.; Hi. May I speak to Noah Levenstein, please?

858
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,400
我就是
speaking.

859
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:34,810
你是首创宝典的人吗？
Are you the one who created the bible?

860
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,070
雷文斯坦 地毯大卖场


861
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,540
不，那应该是上帝
No, that would be God.

862
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,540
不，等等
No, no, no. Hold on.

863
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:44,180
我是指那本宝典
l'm referring to the bible.

864
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,140
我从东瀑高中打来的
I'm calling from East Great Falls High school.

865
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,310
把上你


866
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:54,120
那是我国中的暑假，1969年
NOAH: lt was the summer of my Junior year, 1969,

867
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,960
我的死党和我 去阿姆斯特丹旅行
and my buddies and l, we take this trip to Amsterdam,

868
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:00,970
我们遇到一批 还算迷人的荷兰花痴
where we run into a group of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos

869
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,270
她们愿意以身体交换 几张吉米罕醉克斯的黑胶唱片
who were willing to trade their bodies for a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPs.

870
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,830
不用说，我们和这些女孩 狂欢了一个周末
Well, needless to say, we had ourselves one super weekend with those gals,

871
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,740
也就是开荤了，懂我意思吧
sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

872
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:16,450
坏消息是我们不知道自己在干嘛
But the sad news was, we had no idea what we were doing.

873
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,420
我们不懂技巧
We had no technique.

874
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,380
有一天我们出外观光
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

875
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,430
遇到红灯区的几名妓女
and we run into this Dutch hooker in the red-light district,

876
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,930
她提到这本书
and she tells us about this book.

877
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:33,160
一本性爱指南 十九世纪某个神父写的
lt was a sex manual, evidently written in the 19th century by some priest.

878
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,600
我们从头读到尾
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

879
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,160
然后回到东瀑高中
and then when we got back to East Great Falls,

880
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,000
我决定自己写本书
l had the bright idea to write my own book

881
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,140
加上我自己的观察、经验和忠告
and add my own observations and experiences and advice

882
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:49,150
把书放在图书馆 造福之后的处男学弟
and leave it in the library for some other hapless virgin in the class below us.

883
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:53,280
但我没想到 这本书能流传四十年
But l had no idea it had been passed down for 40 years.

884
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,150
你的书是传奇，雷文斯坦先生
Your book is a legend, Mr. Levenstein.

885
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,150
你带来了？
Do you have it here?

886
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,320
对
Yeah.

887
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,360
我可以看看吗？
May l see it?

888
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,060
我的天
Oh, my.

889
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,260
孩子们
Boys.

890
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,740
这是真正的历史啊
This is a real piece of history here.

891
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:19,350
这本书怎么变这样？
What happened to it?

892
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,180
这就是我们来的原因
Well, that's why we're here.

893
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,510
宝典算是毁了
The bible kinda got ruined,

894
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:26,540
所以我们打给名单上的人 希望重建这本书
so we wanna call everyone on the list and try to reconstruct it.

895
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:33,930
我想你们可能需要帮助
Well, l think you boys might need some help.

896
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:39,830
女孩有个优势 她们彼此会聊天
Well, girls have the advantage, because girls talk to each other,

897
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,630
别自欺欺人了 她们会聊那话儿的
and don't kid yourself, they talk about the penis.

898
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:46,140
它的大小、形状 弯曲的角度
Penis size, penis shape, the angle of the bend.

899
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,170
是否对你眨眼，她们都会聊
Whether it winks at you. They talk.

900
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,200
听好，想和女人做爱 你必须真的关心她
Now, to really make love to a woman, you gotta really care about her.

901
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,240
但...性爱很好 但和你爱的人做？ 那才棒呆了
But... Hey, sex is great, but sex with someone you love? That's awesome.

902
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,080
老兄，真是发人深省
Dude, that is so profound.

903
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,310
我说了算
Telling you.

904
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,290
对，上路绝对很孤独
Yeah, definitely gets lonely on the road.

905
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,920
当然，我和各种菜色做过
sure, l made love to all kinds of different food groups.

906
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,190
你和奶油三明治做过吗？
Did you ever try making love to a peanut-butter sandwich?

907
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,660
无与伦比
Nothing comes close.

908
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:08,750
什么？
What?

909
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:13,100
也许去骨的腿肉有得比 但那需要很多准备
Well, maybe a deboned ham hock, but that takes a whole lot of prep.

910
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:14,760
膝盖弯曲
Bend your knees.

911
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,630
下次手淫时，采印地安坐姿
Next time you spank it, sit lndian-style.

912
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,600
你不会射，永远不会射
You won't come, not in a million years.

913
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,370
性器官就像乐器
MAN: Our sex organs are like musical instruments.

914
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,410
随便找个技师 当然都能吹你的乐器
sure, you can have any technician blow on your horn,

915
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,570

916

我的年轻朋友，那才叫和谐
That, my young friend, is true harmony.

917
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,390
男孩子彼此不聊这些
NOAH: Guys don't talk to each other

918
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:34,390
因为他们视彼此为竞争对手
because they view each other as competitors,

919
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,180
我认为这很疯狂，你懂吗？
which l think is crazy. You know?

920
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,750
因为男人要互相帮助 共同合作才能达阵
Because men need to help each other and work together to get laid.

You said bros befo' hos.

927

lsn't that what you said? Bros befo' hos. And then you screwed my girlfriend.

Well, so did the entire glee club, Carlito. What's your point?

小子，我们得到另一项确认
Boys, we got another confirmation.

932
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:19,240
你必须好好对待女人
MAN: You gotta treat your lady right.

933
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:24,190
你必须温柔、和善 尊重你所爱的人
You've got to be gentle, kind and respectful to the one you love.

934
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:26,920

把手指叉进她的菊花，相信我
stick your finger in her ass. Trust me.

937
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,660
一根还是两根？
Was that two fingers or one?

938
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:37,440
抱歉，这是机密
LUBE: l'm sorry. Confidential matter.

939
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,770
电话、电话，好
NOAH: Phone, phone. Okay.

940
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,060
然后怎么了？
LUBE: Then what happened?

941
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,230
喂，对，77年那一届

2010年 新宝典


950
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,480
这不是性爱宝典
This is not a sex manual.

951
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,380
而是人生宝典

952
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:37,590
我结婚35年了
Now, l've been married for 35 years

953
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:41,220
不只因为我是帅哥一个
and not Just because l'm this handsome dude

954
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,700
知道如何满足女人
who knows how to satisfy a woman.

955
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:47,930
我结婚35年 是因为我爱我太太
l've been married 35 years because l love my wife

956
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:50,940
我尊重太太

957
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,940
不管在阿姆斯特丹 或东瀑高中
And whether it's Amsterdam or East Great Falls,

958
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:55,740
结论都一样
it all comes down to this.

959
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:59,680
如果你够诚实，并尊重女孩
lf you're honest and treat a girl with respect,

960
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:06,450
那么该发生的就会发生 因为那再自然不过了
then whatever happens is meant to happen, because it's all perfectly natural.

961
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,620
孩子们，我为你们准备这场征途

这本书是强而有力的武器

所以要用在好的方面

965
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,080
别做坏事

01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:12,220
宝典


967

你还在找吸尘器？
ROB: You still looking for the vacuum?

969
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:38,910
不，我在柯弟房间找到了，真怪
No. l found it in Cody's room. so strange.

970
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:42,040
我不记得曾放在那里
l mean, l Just don't remember leaving it there.

971
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,990
我显然很健忘
(LAUGHs) Losing my mind, clearly.

972
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:46,580
妈，我可以参加滑雪之旅吗？
Hey, Mom, can l go on the ski trip?

973
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,020

974
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:54,390
但不能喝酒 如果真喝了酒，就不能开车
But no drinking, and if you do drink, no driving.

975
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:58,030
别担心，如果我做错事 一定会被人放上网路...
Don't worry. lf l do anything wrong, l'm sure it'll end up on YouTube, so...

976
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,070
我到了打给你
Call you when l get there.

977
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,490
干杯吧！
Drinking round!

978
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,270
- 算我一份 - 你在这里做什么？

980
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,800
我知道，但你来干嘛？

981
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:38,400
- 我想玩牌 - 是哦
-l wanna play. -Right.

982
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,740
就发牌给她嘛，史提弗，怎么了？
Just deal her in, stifler. What's the big deal?

983
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:42,580
对，发给她
AMY: Yeah, deal her in.

984
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,550
嗨，纳森

01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,720
谢谢你送的花
Thanks for the flowers.

986
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:58,280
抱歉我一直像个混蛋 我已经学到教训了
l'm sorry about being a Jerk. And, for the record, l've learned my lesson.

987
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,330
我准备去尊重你 支持你的守贞誓言
l'm ready to respect you and support you on your pledge.

988
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,860
真的？ 为什么？
Really? But why?

989
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,540
我爱的是你 不是为了性爱
l'm in this for you. l'm not in it Just to have sex.

990
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,910
我了解我爱的是你
Well, l realized that l'm in this for you,

991
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:16,850
如果守贞成为阻碍 那我们感情能好到哪里？
and if the pledge gets in the way of that, then how good can it really be?

992
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:21,650
看来我们有基本共识了 先缓缓，看看未来会如何
sounds like a good basis for the two of us to Just relax and see what happens.

993
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,580

997
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,960
前三章是前戏
The first three chapters are foreplay.

998
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:35,520

1001
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,710
好，我们走吧
Okay, let's go.

1002
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,940
这应该很好玩的
This is supposed to be fun.

1003
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:52,980
一点也不好玩
This isn't fun.

1004
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:56,210
你耐心等，你现在拥有智慧了
Just you wait. You possess wisdom now.

1005
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:58,850
相信宝典说的
Trust in the book.

1006
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:07,250
那是什么意思？ 我太黏人吗？
l mean, what does that mean, anyway? Do you think l'm too clingy?

1007
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,730
不，当然不是
No. No, of course not.

1008
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,690
你知道怎么玩牌吗？

我知道怎么玩
KATlE: l know the game.

1010
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,670
如果我输了，我会脱光光
And l tell you what, if l lose, l'll take off all my clothes.

01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,730
- 好样的 - 真好
AMY: snap. AsHLEY: Nice.

1012
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,640
如果我输了呢？
And if l lose?

1013
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,610
你要向我道歉
You apologize to me.

1014
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,780
- 为了什么？ 不鸟你？ - 对
-For what? Blowing you off? -KATlE: Yes.

1015
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:30,650
如果这还不够，那是我的第一次
lf it's not enough, it was my first time.

1016
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,920
我值得更好的
l deserve better.

1017
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,790
但如果我赢了，你不但要道歉
But if l win, not only do you apologize to me,

1018
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,090
你还要在雪地裸奔

1019
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:45,000
- 耶 - 说定了

感觉好运来了？
Feeling lucky?

1023
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,380
你最好祈祷最后一张是5，宝贝
You better hope for a five on the river, baby.

1024
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,730

1044
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:29,410
那是非常激动的经验
lt's a very intense experience for me.

1045
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,580
快打911
Call 91 1 .

1046
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,760
嘿，我们晚点在小屋见
Hey, l'll meet you at the lodge later.

1047
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,730
好啊，你走吧
Yeah, yeah, sure. Go.

1048
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,670
海蒂，等等
ROB: Heidi. Wait up.

1049
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:05,380
你介意我一起搭吗？
Do you mind if l ride up with you?

1050
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,340
好啊
Okay.

1051
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:38,180
嘿，你好吗？
Hey. What's up?

1052
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,180
我们...我们要坐同一个缆车
We... We're in the same gondola.

1053
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,520
是啊，你看看
Yeah, look at that.

1054
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,690
天啊
Oh, God.

1055
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,780
我没和史提弗上床
l didn't sleep with stifler.

1056
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,750
嗯，我听说了
Yeah. l heard.

1057
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,850
- 你还在恨我？ - 没有
-But you still hate me? -No.

1058
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,430
没有，你怎么这样说？
No. Why would you say that?

1059
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:27,590
那晚之后你没和我说过话
You haven't said a word to me since that night.

1060
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,290
我知道，抱歉
l know. l'm sorry.

1061
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:34,930
我想我只是... 我需要时间厘清我的感觉
l guess l Just... l needed time to work through my feelings.

1062
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:43,170
然后呢？ 你决定呢？
And? What did you decide?

1063
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,180
吉布说史提弗六周内 都要坐在橡皮护垫上
Gibbs says that stifler has to sit on a foam rubber donut for six weeks.

1064
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:54,050
他说他们在考虑 冻伤的部分是否要截肢
And he says they're talking about amputating his feet from frostbite.

1065
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,320
吉布是个骗子 史提弗不需截肢
Gibbs is a liar. stifler doesn't need amputation.

1066
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,990
太可惜了，我工艺课都拿甲的
That's too bad. l got an A in shop.

1067
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:07,670
天啊，那是鼾声吗？
Oh, my. Was that a snort?

1068
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,650
吊车控制室 闲人勿入


1069
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,910
来幸灾乐祸的？
Come to gloat?

1070
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:26,110
不，我来找根香烟
No. Just looking for a fag.

1071
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:30,090
虽然我被麋鹿从后面上了 不代表我就是同志
Just 'cause l took a moose pickle up my ass doesn't mean l'm gay.

1072
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,920
真好笑，你的屁股还好吧？
Very funny. How's your bum?

1073
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,130
感觉像是生了罐美乃滋 谢谢关心
Feels like l gave birth to a mayonnaise Jar, but thanks for asking.

1074
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:41,000
我听说你男友的事了，那真混蛋
Hey, l heard about your boyfriend. That really sucks.

1075
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:44,300
是啊，我还以为 只有高中男生是混蛋
Yeah. l thought only high school boys were Jerks.

1076
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,100
结果他们还是长不大
lt turns out they never outgrow it.

1077
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,870
伊茉珍，恕我直言 你是我认识最成熟的女孩
lmogen, no offense, and you're the most mature girl l know,

1078
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,480
但是24岁的男人 对高中女生是不会认真的
but a 24-year-old dude isn't gonna take a high-school girl seriously.

1079
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,250
我想是吧
l suppose not.

1080
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,050
你想坐一下吗？
You wanna sit down?

1081
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:00,850
干嘛？
What for?

1082
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,860
只是觉得我们现在都需要朋友
l Just thought we could both use a friend right now.

1083
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:17,560
史提弗
stifler.

1084
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,870
是我不好，只是反射动作
My bad. Reflex.

1085
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,040
我很抱歉
ROB: l'm sorry.

1086
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,440
你必须自己做决定
You have to make your own decisions.

1087
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,470
我只是... 我以为我们挺来电的
You know, l Just... l thought we had something.

1088
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,250
以前是啊
We did.

1089
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,180
现在还是
We do.

1090
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,750
我在害怕
l was scared.

1091
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,920
怕什么？
Of what?

1092
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,300
我真的喜欢你
l really like you.

1093
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,870
我希望这段很特别
And l want it to be special.

1094
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:52,430
我猜我只想做好准备
l guess l Just wanted to be ready.

1095
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,880
所以你差点和史提弗上床 是为了我，想做好准备
so you almost had sex with stifler so you'd be ready for me.

1096
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,770
对
Yeah.

1097
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,120
那是我听过最蠢的事
That's the dumbest thing l've ever heard.

1098
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:08,780
嗯，听说你就做了些练习
Well, l heard you got some practice.

1099
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:12,390
事实上根本没发生什么事
You know, the truth is, is nothing happened.

1100
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,130
我不想随便和人上床
l didn't want it to be random like that.

1101
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:18,990
而且...
And...

1102
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:25,360
我无法想像我的第一次 不是和你一起
l couldn't picture my first time being with anybody else but you.

1103
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,520
怎么了？
What was that?

1104
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,830
我不知道
l don't know.

1105
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:55,230
- 我们好像困住了 - 对
-Looks like we're stuck. -Yeah.

1106
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:04,280
我们可能要待上一下子
You know, we could be up here for a while.

1107
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:05,840
对
Yeah.

1108
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:33,340
能问你一个问题吗？
LUBE: Hey, can l ask you a question?

1109
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:35,140
当然，问吧
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1110
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,770
你为何和史考特史提弗 那种混蛋约会？
Why do you hook up with assholes like scott stifler anyway?

1111
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:40,150
什么，你又不认识我
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

1112
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,390
你和其他人一样
(sCOFFs) You know, you're Just the same as all the rest.

1113
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:44,650
我只是你的战利品
l'm Just some sort of trophy to you.

1114
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,190
你不关心我，你只想上我
You don't care about me. You Just wanna sleep with me,

1115
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,120
因为你觉得 那是某种地位象征
because you think it's some sort of status symbol.

1116
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,750
抱歉
sorry.

1117
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,320
天啊
God.

1118
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,800
我们还要困多久？
How long are we gonna be up here?

1119
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,330
我来求救
l'll get help.

1120
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,170
你在做什么？
AsHLEY: What are you doing?

1121
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,010
这不会很高 离雪地大约6公尺
lt's not that far down, and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.

1122
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,100
你想引我注意啊？
What, is this supposed to impress me?

1123
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,200
我是有闪过这个念头
The thought had crossed my mind.

1124
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,370
绝对不行，首先，这样不对
Absolutely not. First of all, it's Just wrong.

1125
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:16,780
其次，你根本不该开门的
second of all, you're not even supposed to touch the door.

1126
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:21,120
第三，这样很危险好吗？ 别靠在那里了
And third, it's Just really dangerous, okay? so Just get away from there.

1127
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:23,660
对，我在想什么？
Right. What was l thinking?

1128
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,530
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1129
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,570
我想我的腿受伤了
l think l hurt my leg.

1130
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,200
白痴
ldiot.

1131
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,890
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1132
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,320
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

1133
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,020
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1134
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:03,560
对，我很好，没事
Yeah, l'm fine. No, l'm fine. l'm fine.

1135
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:07,160
关于你刚说的 说什么我不关心你
About what you said about how l don't care about you

1136
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,000
你只是个战利品，那完全不是真的
and you're Just a trophy, that's actually not true.

1137
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:14,630
我真的喜欢你 我们一起上小学的
l really like you. We went to elementary school together.

1138
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:18,110
我记得六年级的才艺表演 你唱了 《嘿呀！ 》
l remember when you sang Hey Ya! in the sixth-grade talent show.

1139
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:22,310
我记得国一校庆 你从叠罗汉顶端摔下来
l remember when you fell off the pyramid at the homecoming game, freshman year.

1140
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:25,290
你非常不好意思，但我不在乎
You were so embarrassed, but l didn't care.

1141
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:29,150
我喜欢你的反应 好像本来就计划那样
l Just liked how you played it off like it was all part of the routine.

1142
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:35,820
对，你当然是超辣的美女 但我是因为你才喜欢你的
l mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe, but l actually like you for you.

1143
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,730
这也许会吓到你
Look, this may be a shock to you,

1144
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,070
但我完全不懂怎么和女孩相处
but l have no idea what l'm doing with girls.

1145
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:49,940
但我真的想学，只要你给我机会
But l really wanna learn. You Just give me a chance.

1146
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:52,710
我只要求这样
That's all l'm asking.

1147
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:57,440
我保证我会当成这辈子的使命
And l guarantee that l will make it my life's mission

1148
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,850
在各方面全力满足你
to satisfy you in every way possible.

1149
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:40,120
- 我们回去... - 回小屋吧
-Let's go back to the... -To the cabin.

1150
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,150
老兄，你忘了签名
Dude. You forgot to sign it.

1151
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:50,290
你确定我们不能再多保留一年？
You sure we can't Just keep it for one more year?

1152
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:52,600
不，各位，该轮到别人了
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.

1153

and this is what he does with the vacuum every day.

1155
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,420
不！ 嘿！ 不要！

1162

她在利用我，我...那真的很烂
she was using me. l... That was really bad.

1163
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,710
天父，汝为何遗弃我？
Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?

1164
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:16,240
到电器行来帮我吹？
Wanna suck me off in the sharper lmage?

1165
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:19,210
罗伯，你又在胡言乱语？
Rob, are you some kind of Jive turkey?

1166
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:24,280
他和本尊只有分寸之差
He's like an inch away from the real McCoy.

1167
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,960
你有带保险套吗？
Did you bring condoms?

1168
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,090
什么？
What?

1169
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,330
我13岁以前都会尿床，行吗？
l wet the bed until l was 13 years old, okay?

1170
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,990
就算握有一叠 强纳斯兄弟演唱会的后台通行证
You nancy boys couldn't get lucky at a Jonas Brothers concert

1171
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,370
你们两个孬种也把不到女孩
with a fistful of backstage passes.

1172
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:40,300
信上帝得永生
Faith in God and His promise of eternal life.

1173
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:44,880
把保险套套在香蕉上
Now, put the condom on the banana.

1174
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:49,580
谁会想得到？ 时间不早了，该走人了
Who didn't see that coming? Look at the time. Gotta go.
