1
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,824
Mistress, spank my bottom. Spank it really hard!

2
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,488
Please, spank my bottom!

3
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:28,820
- That is unpleasant. -Spank it really hard.

4
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:31,331
Lick my nipples.

5
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,244
No, thank you, pregnant lady.

6
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:35,456
Strip, soldier!

7
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:38,119
You're gonna find out why they call me the drill sergeant.

8
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:32,974
That's... that's nice, baby.

9
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:37,851
No, Frizzy! no!

10
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,363
No, no, no, Frizzy! No!

11
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:46,731
Frizzy.

12
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:50,490
No, no, no, wait! Cody! No.

13
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:13,299
No, no, no, Frizzy! No!

14
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,885
Don't worry about it, man. Everyone's got a sex tape.

15
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,059
Please.

16
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:19,140
Yeah, except they're having sex with people.

17
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:21,313
-Frizzy. - Right.

18
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,846
It's not technically incest 

19
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,150
If your family member's a different species.

20
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,030
So, are you getting close with Dana yet?

21
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:29,654
The rumours are true. She's taken the pledge.

22
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:32,281
No sex? She was your sure thing.

23
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:36,031
-Faith-camp propaganda, man. She's waiting until marriage.

24
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,290
I thought she had sex with six guys.

25
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,413
What?

26
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:46,873
Get to class.

27
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,131
No cell phones in the hall, Alyson.

28
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,593
You can pick this up from my office today after school.

29
00:02:51,682 --> 00:02:55,265
No, no, no,Frizzy! No! Frizzy!

30
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:57,430
Well, I've seen worse.

31
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:00,602
No, no, no, Frizzy! No!

32
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:04,726
Miss Johnson. Lunch today?

33
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:08,905
I'll have to check my calendar, perv...Pete.

34
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,953
No, no, no, Frizzy! No! Frizzy!

35
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,783
Look. Look. Look at that.

36
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,828
No, no, no, Frizzy! No! Frizzy!

37
00:03:23,714 --> 00:03:27,582
- Hey, just ignore them. -Oh, god. You saw it, too?

38
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,899
Just so you know, it's not at all... 

39
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,467
Hey, don't worry about it.

40
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:34,385
Frizzy's a good-looking dog.

41
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,802
So, do you wanna do it? Are we on?

42
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,476
Rob? Rob? Are we on for seventh period?

43
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,100
Yeah. l...i'll...

44
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:49,104
- I'll meet you over there. -Okay.

45
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,616
- Doggy style! - Hey, stifler.

46
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:55,161
Is that your girlfriend?

47
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:57,618
No, we're just...we're just...we're friends.

48
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:00,406
Just friends? How sweet.

49
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:02,528
Well, she seems awful ripe. 

50
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,709
If you don't pick the fruit, I will.

51
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,005
Hey, beautiful.

52
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:17,516
Good morning, east great falls blazers.

53
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,519
Don't forget about the big game against central this week

54
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:24,684
And the aloha dance this friday from 7:00 to midnight.

55
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:28,987
Hawaiian shirts and leis are recommended for entrance.

56
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:33,442
- Charles, knock that off. -Sorry.

57
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:57,881
Let's focus on the quiz, please.

58
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,397
Douche bag.

59
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,639
I'm serious about this pledge, you know.

60
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,847
I know.

61
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:44,972
- So just dancing tonight. - Yeah. Just dancing.

62
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:46,933
The horizontal hula.

63
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,768
Nathan.

64
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,230
Poor Nathan.

65
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:59,947
His willy must be hard enough to cut glass by now.

66
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:02,409
Nathan loves me, and nathan respects me.

67
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:06,745
Okay. A, a guy never respects a girl enough to give up sex.

68
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,120
And, B, well, what about you?

69
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:12,209
You must be feeling pretty randy by now, Dana.

70
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:15,582
Okay, well, yeah, maybe, like, the tiniest bit,

71
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:18,133
But I really feel like I'm connecting with the higher power here.

72
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,795
Yes, I know, and that is totally fab,

73
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:24,260
But I know I couldn't do it. I'm way too into giving blow jobs.

74
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,306
Ask Richard.

75
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,223
Hey, don't listen to Lmogen, okay?

76
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:32,317
Sex is a really big deal, and if you feel like you're not ready,

77
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:34,561
Then I think you should wait.

78
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:37,319
But...

79
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,777
No offence,Heidi, but you have no idea what you're talking about.

80
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,747
Text me later.

81
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,749
-Hey, Rob. -Yeah?

82
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,465
-Can I ask you something? - Sure. What's up?

83
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,546
Well, it's kind of personal.

84
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,760
Okay.

85
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:07,433
I've been thinking. You know I'm a virgin, right?

86
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,809
It's just...I don't know.

87
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,224
Everyone's already done it like a million times already,

88
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:15,775
And I know I don't have a boyfriend or whatever, but...

89
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,862
But sometimes I feel like I should just get it over with.

90
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,161
You know? I mean, just get past this whole thing, this virgin.

91
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,822
What does that even mean, anyway?

92
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,492
So I've never had a penis in my vagina, but so what?

93
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,204
Why do I have to label everything? like, "She's too innocent."

94
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,744
She can't handle it.

95
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:36,298
I'm not that innocent.

96
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,672
I've seen Showgirls and Blue Lagoon.

97
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:45,718
Anyways, I think I've decided to just do it. But what do you think?

98
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:51,601
Yeah. I think you should definitely go ahead and get it over with.

99
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,476
Thanks.

100
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,071
Let's get back to work.

101
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:21,462
Stifler  coming at you live from the aloha dance

102
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:23,671
Here at the east great falls...

103
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:25,759
This chick just grabbed my ass.

104
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,388
She wants to play the stifmeister's flute skin.

105
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:31,312
Let go find some of that sweet-looking pinoche, Gibbsy.

106
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:58,373
Hey, check it out. There's Heidi.

107
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,957
All right, all right. She looks highly doable.

108
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:04,546
All right, so what's the game plan here?

109
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,548
I don't know. Ask her to dance, I guess.

110
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,679
You need a plan, all right? 

111
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,092
It's all about establishing your intentions.

112
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:13,270
See, right now, she thinks of you as just a friend.

113
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:15,106
You need to break that paradigm.

114
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:18,809
Remember, friends don't let friends just be friends.

115
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:21,738
-Right. - I'm serious. you cannot puss out here.

116
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,492
All right, take it easy. I'm gonna go talk to her.

117
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,573
Wait. Aren't you forgetting something?

118
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,291
Here, don't forget these.

119
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,292
You only need those when you're alone.

120
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,583
Right. Right. Okay.

121
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,605
-Okay! -What? What's wrong?

122
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,969
I can't.

123
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:59,149
-But it's only second base. -I know. But if we go there,

124
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,311
Then we're gonna wanna go further.

125
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,189
But Adam and Eve did it.

126
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,857
I'm sorry. Hey, hey.

127
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:10,698
I love you. Do you know that?

128
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:15,124
Come here.

129
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:20,833
Is god okay with a blow job?

130
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,298
I thought you understood how I felt about this.

131
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:26,639
I told you, it's important for me 

132
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,173
To save myself until marriage.

133
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,841
You've had sex with seven guys.

134
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:36,642
And it was six, not seven!

135
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:39,429
Well, one was a black guy, so he counts as two.

136
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:41,557
Dana.

137
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,569
-Dana, come on. -Fuck off.

138
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,031
Dana. Come on, Dana. Dana!

139
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,494
Hey, girls. This is gonna be for sit-on-my-face-book.

140
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,959
I need you to kiss one time, okay?

141
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:03,829
I don't know.

142
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:07,128
Come on. It's gonna be seen by millions of people.

143
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:09,669
Okay.

144
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,430
Okay, we're gonna go again,

145
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,306
But this time, sneak in some tongue for daddy.

146
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,726
Okay.

147
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,820
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

148
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:33,570
Stifmeister strikes again!

149
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:36,577
Dude.

150
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,825
You're gonna love this. Check this out.

151
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:43,749
Yeah. So?

152
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:45,460
Watch and learn.

153
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:51,763
"You're hot."

154
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,669
"Give me your number "

155
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:58,737
"And let's get together"

156
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,811
I throw this at a hot girl,

157
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,798
And she's so impressed that 

158
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,316
I'm literally throwing around a benjamin

159
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,734
That she wants to hook up with me.

160
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,361
Yeah. Good luck with that.

161
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,317
-I'm gonna go find dana. -All right, man.

162
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,973
Oh, no.

163
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:42,808
Oh, god.

164
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:49,155
Excuse me, excuse me, Watch out. Coming through.

165
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,067
So, I was thinking about what 

166
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,570
We were talking about, you know, before.

167
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:00,988
-Yeah. Yeah, I remember. -Right. So I was thinking, why wait?

168
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,002
Right? I mean, you might as well, you know, get it over with.

169
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:06,328
What? Like, here? At the dance?

170
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,331
Well, there's always the library.

171
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,177
-Yeah, the library. - I'm kidding.

172
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:14,179
-Yeah. I know. -But seriously, after the dance,

173
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,342
I don't know if you...

174
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,852
-What are you doing? -Looking for my money.

175
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,518
-C-note thing? -Yeah.

176
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:25,897
-Lose your money? -Shut up.

177
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:34,987
And we're back. What's up, dude? Where's Heidi?

178
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:38,031
I don't know.

179
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:41,997
She was here a second ago. Maybe she went to the bathroom.

180
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,120
-Yeah, maybe. -Dana's pissed at me.

181
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:47,786
Dude, you gotta play along with this whole pledge thing.

182
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,422
Well, that's easy for you to say.

183
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,215
You haven't exactly broken the seal yet, either.

184
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,756
Dude, I've been getting to third base on a regular basis.

185
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:56,051
I can't go back to jacking off now.

186
00:13:56,138 --> 00:14:00,183
Dude, just use your left hand. It feels completely different.

187
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,645
-I'm gonna go find Heidi. -I'm gonna go find Dana.

188
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,083
No! dude, you're gonna make me hurl.

189
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,475
Heidi?

190
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:52,351
No, no, no, no!

191
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,775
Wait.

192
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:57,574
Dude, yo.

193
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,775
What are you doing?

194
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,894
Rob? you said...

195
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:19,478
Rob!

196
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,401
Dude, nice cock block.

197
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:29,623
I'm on fire.

198
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,911
- I'm on fire. -Oh, my god.

199
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:35,786
There's a fire. there's a fire, and it's on me.

200
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,291
Oh, my god.

201
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:46,423
Rob! Rob! put it out. Take off your pants! 

202
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:47,930
Take off...Take your pants off!

203
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,555
Oh, god!

204
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,346
Come on!

205
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,853
Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

206
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:59,434
Hurry, Rob, Come on.

207
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,648
Get it out! Get it out!

208
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:07,824
Oh, god.

209
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,659
What the hell is going on in here?

210
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,537
Two months seems like an awfully 

211
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,084
Long time for saturday detention.

212
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:25,254
We're supposed to clean up the library.

213
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,971
Do you guys know where the vacuum is?

214
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:29,220
Nope.

215
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:33,683
What were you doing in the library anyway?

216
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:36,724
I wasn't doing anything. Heidi was already in there.

217
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,734
-I was just looking for her. -I heard she was blowing some dude.

218
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,017
Cody! well, I don't know how you're 

219
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:43,817
Gonna go on the school ski trip

220
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,318
If you're still on detention.

221
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:48,196
Mom, I don't see what that has to do with it. I didn't do anything.

222
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:49,828
I heard you were the fluffer.

223
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,573
-Cody. -Look. Lis lips are chapped.

224
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,162
Well, we'll see.

225
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:58,660
All right. I have to go get ready.

226
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,250
Maybe it's in the garage.

227
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:09,841
Rob? I wanna have a little chat with you.

228
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,221
Do we have to?

229
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:14,761
Honey, I know that you're growing older,

230
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:18,520
And I don't know what your father has told you about things,

231
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:21,645
But I think it's important to discuss everything, you know?

232
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,528
Like about sex.

233
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:28,022
-Are you having sex? -Mom, I don't wanna talk about this.

234
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:32,827
No, well, it's just that I found this sock in the laundry, and, well...

235
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,697
Oh, god, mom. Put that away.

236
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:43,413
And, also, somebody sent me a link to this video.

237
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:45,882
No, no, no, Frizzy! No.

238
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,629
-Mom, just turn it off! -I don't know how!

239
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,345
Your brother made it my start-up screen.

240
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,423
-Okay, I can...I can fix that. You can? Great.

241
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,547
-Yeah. -Thanks.

242
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,434
-No, no, no, Frizzy! no! -Thank you for that.

243
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,144
-Okay. -And we're done. right? Yeah.

244
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:58,554
Well, honey, please. There's no reason to be ashamed.

245
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:00,308
Masturbation is perfectly natural.

246
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,350
I mean, boys your age are maybe into experimentation

247
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:07,696
And trying new things with animals.

248
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:11,054
I mean, Frizzy, she's been in our family for... 

249
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:11,859
Since she was a puppy...

250
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,988
Hey, I'm late.

251
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:27,249
-You're tardy. -Sorry.

252
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,586
You can start by cleaning off all the damaged books

253
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,215
And separating the ruined ones. I'll be checking on you.

254
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,730
Heidi. Look, about last night...

255
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:41,774
I don't wanna talk about it.

256
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,517
-Well, I just wanted to tell you... - Rob.

257
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,655
I'm gonna go empty this bucket.

258
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,373
Do you have any idea what I found here?

259
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,581
This is the Bible. 

260
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,951
I thought that was an urban legend.

261
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,419
No. This is real. This goes back decades.

262
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,416
Okay. So what?

263
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:52,083
This is exactly what we need to finally get laid.

264
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:55,337
How is this thing gonna help us get laid? It's ruined.

265
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:57,674
You can't even read most of it.

266
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,044
This book has helped one lucky guy 

267
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:00,685
Each year at Great Falls.

268
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:04,015
And this year, that lucky guy is us.

269
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:05,754
Even with the damage, 

270
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,288
It still has a ton of useful stuff. 

271
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,495
Check this out.

272
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:12,737
"February 1st, 1977. The G-spot:"

273
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:17,990
- I can dig it. - What else you got?

274
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:20,458
"1991. How to shave your pubes 

275
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,031
to make your dick look bigger"

276
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,120
Dad showed me that one.

277
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:28,339
"2003. I just had the most amazing sexual experience"

278
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,504
Something I can't read. "She used a breath mint"

279
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:35,591
A breath mint? For what?

280
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:38,298
You moron. You stick it up your tailpipe and

281
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,552
The minty-ness makes your asshole twitch.

282
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:43,222
Everyone knows that.

283
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:46,354
Dude, I don't know. This sounds pretty weak.

284
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:47,389
Plus, I mean, 

285
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,014
We can find most of this stuff on the internet anyway.

286
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,898
No, this is different. This has personal experiences.

287
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:54,396
Plus, it's custom-tailored to Great Falls girls.

288
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:56,282
Since when does Punani have a zip code?

289
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:57,325
What have we got to lose? 

290
00:20:57,326 --> 00:20:59,452
Nathan, you've been working on Dana for, what?

291
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:00,768
Like six months? 

292
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:03,405
Only to find out that she loves the lord more than sex?

293
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:06,832
And, lube, how have all your schemes 

294
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,543
To get laid been working out so far?

295
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,745
Minus $100.

296
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,061
Exactly, and me, well,

297
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,645
I've been wasting all my time 

298
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,548
On some fantasy that someday

299
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:16,267
Heidi's gonna fall madly in love with me. 

300
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:17,803
Face it, guys, we need help.

301
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:20,422
And this is it, staring us right in the face.

302
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,305
- I'm in. - All right.

303
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:25,260
I'm in.

304
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:26,470
- Yeah. - Yes.

305
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:28,978
- Yeah! - Yeah!

306
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,858
Hey, easy. Guys, it's old.

307
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:33,402
"May 1st, 1990.

308
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:38,815
"The simplest way into a girl's pants is still basic flattery"

309
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,826
That's it? Just flatter her?

310
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:44,866


311
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,832
How many times do you actually do it?

312
00:21:47,168 --> 00:21:50,086
Walk up to a girl and say, "Wow, you have beautiful eyes"

313
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:50,815
Like, never.

314
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:53,811
It's telling us the only proven way 

315
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,964
To get women is to be an asshole,

316
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:57,140
'Cause the guys that actually 

317
00:21:57,141 --> 00:21:58,301
Spew that kind of crap get laid.

318
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:00,879
Check it out. Twelve o'clock.

319
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:38,458
- All right. Let's put this bible to a test. - Yes.

320
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:41,473
- You go talk to her. - I'm not trying it out on Ashley.

321
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:43,176
Why don't you go talk to her, 

322
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:44,593
'cause you're the one who likes her?

323
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:48,177
- I'm eating. - Okay. I'll do it.

324
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:21,967
Hey, Ashley.

325
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,095
Hey, Rob. Shopping for your girlfriend?

326
00:23:24,182 --> 00:23:27,516
No...This is...It's for my mom.

327
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,808
She's dating again.

328
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:48,362
Well, you know, I... Actually, I wanted to say,

329
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:53,418
You know, you have the most gorgeous teeth.

330
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:01,675
Hey. Come with me.

331
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:09,100
Jealous? He's making a move on your lady friend.

332
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,850
Unlike you, I don't mind sharing my women.

333
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:14,847
And what are you wankers up to today?

334
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,850
- Cheerio. - Hello, love.

335
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:17,974
Word to your mumsie.

336
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,276
Just waiting for some ladies to join us, in fact.

337
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:21,509
You nancy boys couldn't get laid 

338
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,985
At a Jonas brothers concert

339
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:26,220
With a fistful of backstage passes. 

340
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:26,693
Cheerio.

341
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:30,789
Was that a slam?

342
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:32,702
You bet your bollocks.

343
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,293
- Hold this. - Yeah.

344
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,136
How does this look?

345
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,938


346
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,221
Stand up.

347
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:03,569
Wait, what...what's...Wait, hold...hold on.

348
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:19,666
Should I call you?

349
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:23,842
Just walk out of the store and meet me at the food court.

350
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,342
Act natural.

351
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,329
Can I help you?

352
00:25:56,418 --> 00:26:00,747


353
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,675
Okay, then.

354
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:07,549
- Have a nice day. - You, too.

355
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:17,559
I'm sorry! I wasn't stealing. It was a...it was a prank.

356
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:20,648
I am so sorry. I think we left the tags on your garments.

357
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,507
Please come back to the register. We'll figure this out.

358
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:24,566
I'm so embarrassed.

359
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,158
Oh, my god.

360
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,125
Sorry, l...i got excited.

361
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:49,629
That'll be 149.90.

362
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:53,219
- How much? - 149.90.

363
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:55,768
But they're so small.

364
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:06,607


365
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,292
- Thank you. - Have a nice day.

366
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:25,381
Come again.

367
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:35,800
What took you so long? Did you get it?

368
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:38,088
Sure did. I even stole you a bag

369
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,890
So you don't have to touch it till you get home.

370
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,474
Great. Thanks.

371
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:44,183
Hey. What's up, Ashley?

372
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:46,227
What are you pillow biters doing here?

373
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,399
Stifler.

374
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:50,192
Don't eat that. You're gonna get fat.

375
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:53,448
I'm super horny. Wanna suck me off in the Sharper Image?

376
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,775
Okay.

377
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,710
Dana. Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

378
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:16,552
Didn't mean to disrupt the... This morning's mass.

379
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:19,215
What are you doing here?

380
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,512
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

381
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:23,829
Did you really think 

382
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,933
That this is the best time to discuss this?

383
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,734
Well, you weren't answering any of my texts.

384
00:28:29,863 --> 00:28:31,855


385
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:34,071
What is faith?

386
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:36,614
When you flip the light switch in your kitchen,

387
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:39,111
You know that the light will turn on.

388
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:41,578
Some might call that faith, 

389
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:44,662
but I tell you, that is not the real faith.

390
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:47,501
Okay, so what is so important 

391
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:48,877
That you needed to come and interrupt church?

392
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:50,673
I don't really get why you're so mad at me right now.

393
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,714
Because you don't respect me. 

394
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,887
This is all just a big joke to you.

395
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:57,154
You know what? You're right, 

396
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,554
Because this is just another face for you.

397
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:00,184
Just like your little stint on yearbook.

398
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:01,742
You stuck with that for, what, 

399
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:02,724
Two weeks before you got bored with it?

400
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:05,268
Why is it so hard for you to believe that I wanna

401
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:06,732
Wait until marriage?

402
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:08,015
Because you slept with Doug Wheeler.

403
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:10,232
And Scott Thompson on the same night.

404
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,396
That doesn't count: I was drunk.

405
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:13,603
Is that Dana?

406
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,572
As soon as you get bored with this whole pledge thing,

407
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:18,409
You're just gonna jump right back in the saddle again.

408
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:20,701
And when you get to college, don't even tell me

409
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,443
That you won't be experimenting 

410
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:23,624
with the standard lesbian hookups,

411
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,997
Having three-ways, trying anal.

412
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:28,243
- Yeah. - Yeah.

413
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:29,369
That's what I'm talking...

414
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:30,709
Just relax.

415
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:31,913
- Do something! - Faith is...

416
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:33,419


417
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,134
Faith is the rock-solid...

418
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,741
You don't think I'm committed to this? 

419
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,137
My parents waited until marriage.

420
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:41,390
My dad went to high school with your mom.

421
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:42,970
He said she blew the whole football team

422
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,436
And had to have her stomach pumped.

423
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,350
Don't be gross, okay?

424
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:49,143
Plus, your dad was a beta.

425
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,942
Those guys are notorious poon slayers.

426
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,937
Fuck it! This is bullshit!

427
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:58,192
You know you want this.

428
00:29:58,994 --> 00:30:00,322
Did we miss communion?

429
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,465
Go for the East Great Falls Blazers

430
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:06,292
Go, Blazers!

431
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:07,588
Which is surprising, 

432
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:09,710
since this is the last home game of the season.

433
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:11,789
You'd think they'd really pump up the power there.

434
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:13,625
Look at him! Watch that guy! Watch that guy!

435
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:17,928
Even though it's close to a tie, 

436
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:20,800
Oh, my gosh, wait. So, what did your dad say?

437
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:23,216
He said if he ever sees Nathan within 100 feet of me,

438
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,386
He's gonna castrate him with a rusty garden weasel.

439
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:29,179
Oh, no. So what? Is it over between you guys or what?

440
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:30,472
I don't know.

441
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,312
Well, if you ever want to try a mage, 

442
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:34,150
You're welcome to join Richard and me.

443
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:36,859
- No. - No.

444
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,487
Please don't say "young boy" around Coach Daly.

445
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:41,035
Yeah, out here he's...

446
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,494
- What about you, missy? - What?

447
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,038
How's your sex life?

448
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:46,743
You guys, I'm gonna go through with it. I am. I am.

449
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:47,775
You're so boring. 

450
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:50,036
I would've thought you'd be fielding offers

451
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:52,168
After your striptease in the library.

452
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,705


453
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,290
Blue and white, let's go, fight, win. 

454
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,474
Let's go, fight, win.

455
00:31:04,684 --> 00:31:09,809
Blue and white, let's go, fight, win. Blazers!

456
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:13,018
Fight, win. Blue and white, let's go, fight, win.

457
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:44,258
I think that is quite enough pictures of the cheerleaders.

458
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:46,757
How about we get some of the game?

459
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:07,365
As you were.

460
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:13,664
Douche bag.

461
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:15,747
Blue and white...

462
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,214
Shearson's bringing the ball up court.

463
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,706
He passes it off to Scott Stifler.

464
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,096
Central takes a charge from Shearson.

465
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:33,271
Time out, Blazers. What are we gonna do now, bill?

466
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:34,680
Ten seconds in the game.

467
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:36,399
I think these guys really need to get their act

468
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:38,334
Get your head in the game, doggy style.

469
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,185
You can finish your wet dream later.

470
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,071
- I'm sorry. - This is it for this game.

471
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:44,149
Hey, Scott? Can I talk to you for a sec?

472
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:45,752
Are you nuts? I'm in the middle of a game.

473
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:46,912
Last home game of the season.

474
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:49,325
Really gotta get their act together.

475
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,621
Tie game, 89 all, 3:9 seconds left. 

476
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,079
Let's see what's gonna happen here.

477
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,498


478
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:59,340
They have the advantage.

479
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,414
Looks like... Double screen!

480
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:04,713
Shearson gets the ball. It's good! It's in!

481
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:09,596
The game's over. 91-89 for East Great Falls Blazers.

482
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:11,500
This is incredible, folks! 

483
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:13,468
This means we're going on to the playoffs!

484
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:15,686
Unbelievable! It's exciting.

485
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:19,976
What a chain of events that has occurred here today!

486
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:28,157
Honey, I need to talk to you.

487
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:30,329
Yeah, sure.

488
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:33,289
Is...is that a bible?

489
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,917
What? No. No, it's...

490
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,800
Well, honey, it's okay to read the bible. 

491
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,038
I mean, gosh, you act like

492
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:39,161
I caught you reading pornography.

493
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:42,919
What did you wanna talk about?

494
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:45,796
Well, I just got my credit card statement and...

495
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,613
And here on your card 

496
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:49,339
There's a charge here for a lingerie store.

497
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:52,853


498
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:56,354
Is there a girl you're seeing?

499
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:59,643
No. Mom, it's complicated.

500
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:03,530
- did you buy something for yourself? - no!

501
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:05,357
Because it's a very normal area of exploration.

502
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:06,089
My book says that 

503
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,864
Most fetishes are not homosexual in nature,

504
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:10,779
And, well, you know, boys, they tend to...

505
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:13,014
Yes, mom, that's it. You figured it out. 

506
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:14,489
I love wearing women's underwear.

507
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,204
Thongs, g-strings, a little teddy now and then.

508
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:19,832
It's so soft and silky smooth. The frillier the better.

509
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:20,952
Sexy.

510
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:23,254
Oh, god! Come on.

511
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:24,373
Gotcha.

512
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:31,013
So it was for a girl.

513
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:33,720
Yeah, mom.

514
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:35,473
Great.

515
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:53,036
So, you know that thing you told me before the dance?

516
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,200
Yeah.

517
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,745
Right, well, I was thinking about that conversation.

518
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,577
So, what about it?

519
00:34:58,793 --> 00:35:02,838
I was just thinking, you know, maybe you should wait.

520
00:35:03,798 --> 00:35:07,582


521
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:10,251
But I still feel like I'm making this whole thing

522
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,351
Into, like, this huge deal. 

523
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:14,510
I mean, it's consuming my every thought.

524
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,931
I don't know, Rob.

525
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:23,439
I still feel like it's best if I just get it over with.

526
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:26,523
Yeah. I can see that.

527
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:32,400
You figured it out. I love wearing women's underwear.

528
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:34,819
Thongs, g-strings, a little teddy now and then.

529
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:37,665
It's so soft and silky smooth. The frillier the better.

530
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,955
What is up with this crap, butt nugget?

531
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:42,131
That was taken completely out of context.

532
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,957
All right? I was being facetious.

533
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:46,959
That means he wasn't being serious.

534
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:51,089
I know what facetious means, dick face.

535
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:53,838
Are you trying to repel all the pussy in school?

536
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,474
- No... - Tick tock, doggy boy.

537
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,969
You cock is on the clock.

538
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:01,305
Excuse me. Take notes.

539
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:07,611
- Hey, Imogen. - Stifler.

540
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,569
The word for the day is legs

541
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,522
So?

542
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,248
So, why don't we go back to my place 

543
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,152
And spread the word?

544
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,653
Well, how about you save your breath?

545
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,205
You're gonna need it to inflate your date later.

546
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:29,342
Gentlemen, it is time we got laid.

547
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,875
Really? And what is it we've been trying to do all this time?

548
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,188
No, no. We need to get laid.

549
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:37,011
Right here. September 9th, 1995.

550
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:40,515
Can you give us the executive summary?

551
00:36:40,604 --> 00:36:44,553
No, not that. This.

552
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:49,522
We are going on a road trip.

553
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:10,250
How long do you intend on staying in Canada?

554
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:13,091
Just a couple of hours.

555
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:15,715
What's the nature of your visit?

556
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:19,388
We've driven many miles in search of vertical smiles.

557
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,679
We use kilometres here.

558
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:31,397
Then we've driven many clicks to wet our dicks?

559
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:33,103
Yes! Yeah!

560
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:34,941
- That works, right? - Bye bye.

561
00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:39,071
Fucking Americans.

562
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:43,398
You know, the exchange rate 

563
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,871
On the dollar is really gonna help us out.

564
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,991
Yeah.

565
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:47,746
Okay, up ahead, turn right.

566
00:37:47,837 --> 00:37:49,118
- You sure? - Yes. Turn right.

567
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:09,938
Okay, boys. Let's do this.

568
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,569
Are you sure this is a good idea?

569
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:13,610
Come on, you pussy. Let's get laid.

570
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,989
The bible says to ask for Monique.

571
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,703
Hi. Are you Monique?

572
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:33,255
No, moi, no, no, no. mais, 

573
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:35,962
Monique, she is inside.

574
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:37,886
Come. Come, boys.

575
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:48,810
Boys, entrez chez nous.

576
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:51,092
C'est magnifique, no? 

577
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:53,726
I will get Monique.

578
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:58,234
She will be so happy to see you.

579
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:01,242
In the meantime, make yourselves at home.

580
00:39:04,748 --> 00:39:06,339
Jesus, tits. 

581
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,665
We came to the right place.

582
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,871
Is that a moose?

583
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:11,535
Condom?

584
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,497
Why, thank you.

585
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:17,212
Gentlemen.

586
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,843
Thank you.

587
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:23,385
Very much.

588
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,059
Thank you.

589
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:29,348
Can't wait to see Monique.

590
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:47,285
We're here to see Monique.

591
00:39:50,085 --> 00:39:53,536
I am Monique.

592
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:58,127
Well, that's...that's okay.

593
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:05,401
Come, come. I make you a nice drink.

594
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:29,603
Could you just give us just one minute?

595
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:36,067
This could be very educational for all of us. 

596
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:36,971
Really?

597
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:46,174
He's up. 

598
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,775
No, no. Why am I first?

599
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,187
It was your idea.

600
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:51,125
Don't...don't insult Monique. 

601
00:40:51,126 --> 00:40:52,396
She has an entire chapter in the bible.

602
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:54,066
Come on, you're going to have a nice time.

603
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:57,027
You two crazy kids have fun.

604
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:20,513
And welcome.

605
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:26,376
So...so, how does this work? 

606
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:27,472
Am I supposed to pay you?

607
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,392
No, no, no. Not yet.

608
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:38,569
I see.

609
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:37,084
You've got one active imagination, boy.

610
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,639
How long was I out?

611
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:44,801
Only about eight seconds that time.

612
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,903
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. no. no. no, no, no.

613
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:09,489
Yes. yes.

614
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:19,509
Monique! That's really nice.

615
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:34,144
That's it.

616
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:44,197
I'm so sorry. I usually last a lot longer.

617
00:43:46,245 --> 00:43:47,277
Hey.

618
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:51,371
Hey, was I supposed to tap you on the shoulder or something?

619
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:55,211
Oh, no. No.

620
00:43:56,714 --> 00:44:00,498
Help! help! help, help, help!

621
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:03,716
Go, go, go! go! I'm coming!

622
00:44:05,598 --> 00:44:06,761
- Jesus. Dude. - Oh, god!

623
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,130
What, do you need an audience?

624
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:09,446
No, no. Wait, guys. 

625
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:09,969
I think she's dead!

626
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:11,641
Excuse me?

627
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:13,521
Oh, my god. This is not good.

628
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:14,709
I can't get her off. 

629
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,227
I think she had a heart attack.

630
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:16,852
Help! 

631
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:17,833
she's got lockjaw.

632
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:18,393
Get her off of me!

633
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:19,747
oh, my god. oh, my god. 

634
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:20,728
It's lockjaw.

635
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:23,822
Lockjaw! Lockjaw, lockjaw, lockjaw, lockjaw, lockjaw!

636
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:25,568
- Okay. - Get her off!

637
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,861
I'm sorry!

638
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,045
Phone. Phone. Wait. Clear!

639
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:40,625
Shit. What am I doing?

640
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:42,376
Clear, clear!

641
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:48,101
Okay. Come down here. 

642
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,265
Grab her legs. One, two, three.

643
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:55,396
Forget it. It's totally screwed up.Oh, god.

644
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:00,526
What you do to maman?

645
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:11,910
Maman! You killed maman! 

646
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,035
You killed maman!

647
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:32,146
Fucking Americans! Come back here.

648
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,264
I'll kill you! I'll kill you, you cowards!

649
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:39,149
I killed her.

650
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,025
I killed her with my sperm!

651
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,722
Hey, man

652
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,335
When it's your time to go, it's your time to go.

653
00:45:43,335 --> 00:45:44,195
She led a full life.

654
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,311
How do you know that?

655
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:47,024
Man, what do you want me to say? 

656
00:45:47,025 --> 00:45:47,648
You're the one that murdered her!

657
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:48,995
I can't believe that was the woman 

658
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,325
The bible said we should have sex with.

659
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:54,947
Right here,"September 9th, 1995:"

660
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:57,167
Let me see that.

661
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:00,939
No. no, that's a seven! 

662
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,172
That's 1975. It's from the '70s.

663
00:46:04,634 --> 00:46:06,840
- I thought it was a nine. - Shut up! Shut up!

664
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:08,800
I didn't do anything! 

665
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:11,506
Shut up! Just shut up! I wanna go home.

666
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,797
I don't wanna be here.

667
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,183
Oh, my god! I just hit a squirrel.

668
00:46:19,273 --> 00:46:21,065
Well, that went well.

669
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,726
Guys, I think it's time we try my interpretation.

670
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,379
Look, Nathan

671
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,939
You've been trying to convince Dana to sleep with you

672
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:29,190
Instead of just listening to her. Right, you know?

673
00:46:29,283 --> 00:46:31,520
Trying to see things from her point of view? 

674
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:32,320
Showing just...

675
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:34,404
Just a little respect.

676
00:46:34,497 --> 00:46:35,354
And you, you're still 

677
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:37,414
Trying to trick women into sleeping with you

678
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,540
Instead of just being honest.

679
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:41,349
And you're still too much of a pussy 

680
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,378
To tell Heidi you're into her.

681
00:46:47,278 --> 00:46:49,178


682
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,763
You going to Stifler's house tonight?

683
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:57,223
Yeah. I'll probably go with Dana.

684
00:46:57,353 --> 00:47:00,888
So any luck losing that thing you were trying to get rid of?

685
00:47:00,982 --> 00:47:03,389
- Rob. - I'm just asking.

686
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:05,607
Maybe you should mind your own business.

687
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:11,240
What's with you today?

688
00:47:21,127 --> 00:47:22,507
I wanna tell you something that 

689
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:25,041
I've been wanting to say for a long time.

690
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:26,210
Okay.

691
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:33,089
I really like you.

692
00:47:33,723 --> 00:47:35,762
I really like you, too.

693
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:41,600
No, not like that. I really like you.

694
00:47:47,153 --> 00:47:48,433
- Rob... - I think you're great.

695
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:52,067
You have a great personality. I laugh at all your jokes. 

696
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:53,567
You're pretty.

697
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:58,368
Oh, god, you're pretty. You even smell great.

698
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:01,665
I don't know. I'm just... 

699
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,249
I'm happy when I'm around you.

700
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:04,527
Now, I don't know if you feel the same way 

701
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:05,163
but if you do...

702
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:06,467
Let's not waste any more time. 

703
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:07,247
Right? let's just

704
00:48:08,341 --> 00:48:10,713
See where our feelings take us.

705
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:16,215
I feel the same way.

706
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:19,468
- You do? - Yes.

707
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,764
This is great. Why didn't you say something?

708
00:48:22,855 --> 00:48:24,349
Why didn't you?

709
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:32,663
It's about that time, so I gotta go. but I'll see you tonight?

710
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:35,404
Yes.

711
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:56,258
Dad?

712
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,473
There she is.

713
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:09,103
They saw me! Get down! Get down!

714
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,366
Oh, my god. Oh, my gosh. 

715
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,753
Drive. drive.

716
00:49:16,014 --> 00:49:16,699
It's cool. It's cool.

717
00:49:17,827 --> 00:49:20,863
Nathan, look, I've been thinking.

718
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:23,747
Maybe I've been too hard on you.

719
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:25,864
You have?

720
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:28,468
You obviously love my daughter, 

721
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:29,959
And you two should be together.

722
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:33,503
- We should? - Absolutely.

723
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:37,835
Honey, it is not right to give a man blue balls.

724
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,964
If you want boys to like you

725
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:40,746
you gotta put out.

726
00:49:40,746 --> 00:49:42,842
Here, start with nathan's friend.

727
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:56,239
This is so not cool.

728
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:58,897
I mean, fantasising about your best friend's girlfriend?

729
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:02,154
Oh, my god!

730
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:05,407
- Dad! Stop! Stop. - Fucknut!

731
00:50:31,526 --> 00:50:33,435
All right, girls.

732
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:35,687
- Party looks good. - Yeah.

733
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:40,028
All right, listen to me. Stay focused.

734
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:42,047
Be honest, show respect 

735
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:43,451
And just say whatever's on your mind.

736
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:44,569
Stop, jerk.

737
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:45,743
I can't even get near Dana.

738
00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:47,242
She'll be here. She's coming with Heidi.

739
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,871
Just try and think of things from her point of view.

740
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:51,313
Yeah, and I might as well just crack the da vinci code 

741
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,665
While I'm at it.

742
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:54,795
Just get her some frankincense and myrrh.

743
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:55,914
That's a great idea.

744
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:58,297
I'll just pick up some roofies for you while I'm out.

745
00:50:58,386 --> 00:51:01,636
You need a prescription for that, from what I hear.

746
00:51:01,722 --> 00:51:03,632
Lube, pay attention. This applies to you, too.

747
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:07,674
All right. Let's try to go in there and just be real.

748
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:10,306
All right, Oprah.

749
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:38,823
Hey. Isn't that that chick from Central?

750
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,654
Yeah.

751
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,500
Hey, Stifler.

752
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,454
Oh, hey, there...

753
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:47,160
Katie.

754
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,859
Katie, right. I knew that. 

755
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,962
Just having some fun with you.

756
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,001
Can I talk to you for a second, like, in private?

757
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,794
Yeah, sure, you know what?

758
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:59,890
Let me just grab another beer and I'll be right back with you.

759
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:01,802
Don't you flake on me.

760
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:06,981
- Dude, you been working out? - Didn't think so.

761
00:52:07,108 --> 00:52:10,524
- You two, stay amazing. - My god.

762
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:15,572
Hey, what's up, beautiful?

763
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:17,567
You know, I got so drunk last weekend

764
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,356
That I nailed my cock to a table 

765
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:21,076
then set it on fire.

766
00:52:21,497 --> 00:52:22,991
Wanna check it out?

767
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:24,956
The table or your cock?

768
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:27,160
God, I love that accent.

769
00:52:27,253 --> 00:52:29,080
Could you do me a favour and just say,

770
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:30,541
"spank me, Stifler. "

771
00:52:31,557 --> 00:52:33,351
"Spank me wee little bum."

772
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:36,923
How did you know I like to be spanked?

773
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:40,047
Awesome!

774
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:42,978
So where's this boyfriend Richard you 

775
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:45,015
Keep talking about non-stop all the time?

776
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:47,642
He doesn't attend high-school parties.

777
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,003
Sounds like you might be 

778
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:52,275
In the market for some home-grown American beef.

779
00:52:52,361 --> 00:52:53,986
Sorry, I'm vegan.

780
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,270
Cheers.

781
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:01,326
What if I use a cucumber?

782
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:06,294
All right, boys. Tonight's the night. 

783
00:53:06,295 --> 00:53:07,180
Wish me luck.

784
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:08,463
Good luck, buddy.

785
00:53:08,557 --> 00:53:09,540
Good luck, dude. 

786
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:11,013
Tonight, you become a man.

787
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:13,308
That's it. Tonight, I'm getting laid!

788
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,644
- Yeah, buddy! Yes! - Yeah, buddy.

789
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:17,142
- Yes! - Right here.

790
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:19,190
Just give it to her nice and slow at first.

791
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:20,984
Then speed her up.

792
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,435
Dana!

793
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:24,817
Dana!

794
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:38,322
I can't find Heidi anywhere. 

795
00:53:38,323 --> 00:53:39,316
Maybe she didn't come.

796
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,530
No, no. Her car is outside.

797
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:43,781
How you making out?

798
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:45,364
Check it out.

799
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,062
Don't you think maybe 

800
00:53:48,063 --> 00:53:50,622
Ashley's just a little bit out of your league?

801
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,110
I don't know. I'm just saying, you know

802
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:54,956
You've been at it for years.

803
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,419
Maybe it's just not in the cards for you.

804
00:53:57,508 --> 00:53:58,967
I'm a man of refinement.

805
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:02,301
Why settle for a six when you can get a perfect 10?

806
00:54:05,307 --> 00:54:08,511
Okay, whatever you say, man. Good luck.

807
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:11,135
Right. I'm gonna do it.

808
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,647
Hey, what's up, ashley?

809
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,479
Hey, Lube.

810
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:17,849
You want a beer?

811
00:54:17,945 --> 00:54:19,320
Got a beer.

812
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,651
Right.

813
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:23,189
So...

814
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,862
You obviously know that I'm, like, totally into you. Right?

815
00:54:30,124 --> 00:54:31,702
Yeah. I've seen the Shrine.

816
00:54:34,128 --> 00:54:35,752
All right.

817
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:38,610
Okay, so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

818
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,414
I'm just gonna lay it out on the line.

819
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:43,000
No tricks, no hidden agenda at all.

820
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,550
I happen to be a sensitive and expert lover.

821
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:56,055
I can guarantee that I will satisfy you in every way possible,

822
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,356
And I shall not stop until I'm certain

823
00:54:58,444 --> 00:55:01,729
That you are completely happy with my endeavours.

824
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:07,149
Okay.

825
00:55:15,419 --> 00:55:20,662
Look, that was a really interesting speech,

826
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:22,345
And I don't really wanna embarrass you in front of

827
00:55:22,346 --> 00:55:24,886
everyone, but...

828
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:27,589
But it's not gonna happen.

829
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:31,181
I mean, I think that you're, like, really super cool,

830
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:33,060
And you're really funny in class and everything,

831
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:35,897
But I don't wanna have sex with you.

832
00:55:36,774 --> 00:55:37,853
Okay?

833
00:55:38,317 --> 00:55:40,191
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Okay.

834
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,026
- So are we cool? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

835
00:55:44,365 --> 00:55:45,563
All right.

836
00:55:45,658 --> 00:55:47,235
Well, I'm gonna go get another beer. Do you want one?

837
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:49,995
No, no. I'm...I'm good. I'm good.

838
00:55:56,877 --> 00:55:59,878
What you said just now?

839
00:56:00,172 --> 00:56:01,287
Yeah?

840
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,966
Was that true?

841
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:06,097
Guaranteed satisfaction and you won't 

842
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:09,055
Stop until a girl is completely satisfied?

843
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:11,303
Yeah.

844
00:56:12,977 --> 00:56:15,646
All right. Well, what the hell.

845
00:56:16,355 --> 00:56:19,558
Meet me upstairs in the first bedroom to the left.

846
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:30,931


847
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:35,617
The truth is, yes, I was trying to pressure you,

848
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:38,460
Because I really, really wanna have sex.

849
00:56:38,586 --> 00:56:42,630
But I really wanna have sex with you.

850
00:56:43,591 --> 00:56:44,956
And, also, I mean, with us,

851
00:56:44,957 --> 00:56:47,458
hooking up has always been about me.

852
00:56:49,597 --> 00:56:51,761
I wanna forget myself for once 

853
00:56:51,762 --> 00:56:53,926
And try to make you feel good for a change.

854
00:56:54,018 --> 00:56:57,876
Like, maybe try and make you feel the way that

855
00:56:57,877 --> 00:56:58,929
You make me feel.

856
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:26,838
You shouldn't...You shouldn't... It's my phone.

857
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:28,387
Don't read my phone.

858
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:32,932
What's this supposed to mean? "Give her a dose of manthrax"?

859
00:57:33,143 --> 00:57:34,174
Well, I don't...what does that...

860
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:36,095
I don't know what that... Do you know what that means?

861
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:38,096
"I'm getting laid"?

862
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:41,599
You're advertising this before it even happens?

863
00:57:41,693 --> 00:57:42,772
- No. - Wow.

864
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:45,233
You must be some special kind of asshole.

865
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:47,610
No. no, no, no! no. I didn't...It was...

866
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:50,284
Later, loser.

867
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:59,376
Faster. Okay. Now, slower. Yes, Yes.

868
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:02,462
Slower. Tickle the bunny. Yes, Yes.

869
00:58:02,547 --> 00:58:05,085
Oh, God, the man in the boat is out.

870
00:58:05,175 --> 00:58:07,500
Paddle, paddle, do the Alphabet. Swirl.

871
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:11,212
Back to the bunny. That's it. Okay. Now, more to the left.

872
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:13,299
More to the left!

873
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,266
- My left or your left? - My left, my left, my left!

874
00:58:15,351 --> 00:58:16,383
All right.

875
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:20,138
Hey, have you seen Heidi?

876
00:58:20,899 --> 00:58:22,097
Thanks.

877
00:58:23,693 --> 00:58:24,974
Hey, Rob.

878
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:27,978
Heidi?

879
00:58:29,032 --> 00:58:32,448
Hey, doggy style. I told you, you snooze, you lose.

880
00:58:32,535 --> 00:58:35,987
So unless you want mop-up duty, close the door, pervert.

881
00:58:46,674 --> 00:58:47,837
Hey, where are you going?

882
00:58:47,926 --> 00:58:50,132
This was a horrible idea.

883
00:58:57,435 --> 00:58:59,309
Rob? Excuse me.

884
00:59:00,563 --> 00:59:04,312
Excuse me. Rob. Rob.

885
00:59:05,235 --> 00:59:06,978
- Go away. - I didn't. I...

886
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,643
I don't wanna see your face right now.

887
00:59:10,532 --> 00:59:11,646
Rob.

888
00:59:26,923 --> 00:59:28,002
What are you doing?

889
00:59:28,091 --> 00:59:29,331
What happened to forgetting about yourself 

890
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:32,171
And making me feel good?

891
00:59:32,971 --> 00:59:34,679
But I thought I just...

892
00:59:34,764 --> 00:59:36,258
What? You thought that what, Nathan?

893
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:38,201
That you could just pretend that you cared about

894
00:59:38,202 --> 00:59:39,683
My feelings and my pledge

895
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:42,687
And then just go and try again when my guard was down?

896
00:59:42,772 --> 00:59:45,061
No. You don't get it. I...

897
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:48,186
No. no, you're the one that's not gonna get it.

898
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:01,576
Dude, you need to slow down.

899
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:03,955
Yeah, seriously. Let's just go home.

900
01:00:04,043 --> 01:00:07,543
You, Sir... you, Sir, were right about the Bible.

901
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:11,127
Because assholes get laid!

902
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:13,416
Yes.

903
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,884
No. no, no, dude. You were right.

904
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:21,384
- There's something to it. - What are you talking about?

905
01:00:21,478 --> 01:00:23,060
We tried the nice guy thing

906
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:25,096
and I believe we're all still virgins.

907
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,559
Well, the nice guy vibe got me past the bouncer, man.

908
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:37,633
Well, gentlemen, you failed, 

909
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,860
And the proof, as they say, is in the jell-o.

910
01:00:41,873 --> 01:00:44,364
So I will see you later, nice guys.

911
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:51,876
I know you want me.

912
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:55,252
I'm gonna let you take me upstairs and do me right now.

913
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,262
- Really? - Yeah.

914
01:00:57,972 --> 01:00:59,217
Kiss me.

915
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:12,025
Hey, ladies.

916
01:01:21,162 --> 01:01:22,573
Oh, my god.

917
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:24,742
Oh, my god!

918
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,076
Look at those taters!

919
01:01:35,969 --> 01:01:37,677
Do me from behind.

920
01:01:38,012 --> 01:01:39,127
What?

921
01:01:40,765 --> 01:01:43,256
I thought you liked it doggy style.

922
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:52,312
What are you doing back there? let's go.

923
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:56,654
You're not putting your dick in that, are you?

924
01:01:58,992 --> 01:02:01,565
Are you kidding me? Gross.

925
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:25,218
Here. This'll help.

926
01:02:25,518 --> 01:02:26,716
Thanks.

927
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:29,164
Honey, I know that

928
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:31,061
I can't stop you from doing certain things,

929
01:02:31,149 --> 01:02:34,316
But I can insist that you are safe.

930
01:02:34,777 --> 01:02:36,485
Did you drink and drive?

931
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:39,062
No. John Costello drove me home.

932
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:40,954
I want you to know that

933
01:02:40,954 --> 01:02:44,859
if you find yourself in any carnal situation,

934
01:02:44,954 --> 01:02:47,492
That you...You will use protection.

935
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:49,992
What do you mean by carnal?

936
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,702
This.

937
01:02:58,802 --> 01:03:00,593
Are you kidding me? gross.

938
01:03:00,678 --> 01:03:02,754
Is there no such thing as privacy any more?

939
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:04,596
I will tell your father that

940
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,596
You're just not up to seeing him today.

941
01:03:06,684 --> 01:03:08,594
You're not feeling well.

942
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:10,682
Thanks.

943
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,859
How was she?

944
01:03:17,403 --> 01:03:19,396
- How was who? - Vomit girl.

945
01:03:19,781 --> 01:03:20,860
How do you know about that?

946
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:24,282
Who do you think is forwarding all those videos to mom?

947
01:03:29,165 --> 01:03:30,957
I'm ready to give up.

948
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:32,662
I thought I had the answers.

949
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:36,453
It's too bad that 99% of the Bible's completely unreadable.

950
01:03:38,383 --> 01:03:39,711
That's it.

951
01:03:40,426 --> 01:03:42,549
We need to reconstruct the Bible.

952
01:03:42,637 --> 01:03:43,716
Why?

953
01:03:43,805 --> 01:03:45,216
The secrets are in there.

954
01:03:45,306 --> 01:03:48,224
I mean, there's no one single answer to getting laid.

955
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:50,267
Right? We need the whole book to understand.

956
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:52,429
Probably has a lot of crap in there that we need to know, too,

957
01:03:52,522 --> 01:03:55,523
Like positions, techniques, angle of insertion.

958
01:03:55,608 --> 01:03:57,714
Exactly. That's what the Bible was created for,

959
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:59,820
To help guys like us.

960
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:03,107
And we owe it to the others. I ruined the bible.

961
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:05,987
I owe it to future generations to restore its wisdom.

962
01:04:06,077 --> 01:04:08,829
Dude, I'm all for it, but how?

963
01:04:14,836 --> 01:04:16,496
Where do we start?

964
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:20,256
From the beginning.

965
01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:22,508
This must be the guy who created the Bible.

966
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:24,775


967
01:04:27,682 --> 01:04:28,880
Hello?

968
01:04:28,975 --> 01:04:31,762
Hi, may I speak to Noah Levenstein, please?

969
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:32,884
Speaking.

970
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:35,304
Are you the one who created the Bible?

971
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:39,057
No, that would be God.

972
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:41,062
Hold on.

973
01:04:41,362 --> 01:04:44,696
I'm referring to the Bible.

974
01:04:45,617 --> 01:04:47,360
I'm calling from east great falls high school.

975
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,625
It was the summer of my junior year, 1969,

976
01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:57,461
And my buddies and I, we take this trip to Amsterdam,

977
01:04:57,545 --> 01:05:01,460
Where we run into a group of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos

978
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:02,831
Who were willing to trade their bodies for

979
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,761
a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPS.

980
01:05:05,845 --> 01:05:06,701
Well, needless to say,

981
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:10,341
we had ourselves one super weekend with those gals,

982
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:13,263
Sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

983
01:05:14,062 --> 01:05:16,932
But the sad news was, we had no idea what we were doing.

984
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:18,766
We had no technique.

985
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,902
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

986
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,940
And we run into this dutch hooker in the red-light district,

987
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:27,439
And she tells us about this book.

988
01:05:28,618 --> 01:05:30,130
It was a sex manual,

989
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:33,659
evidently written in the 19th century by some priest.

990
01:05:33,748 --> 01:05:36,120
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

991
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:38,665
And then when we got back to east great falls,

992
01:05:38,753 --> 01:05:41,505
I had the bright idea to write my own book

993
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:45,634
And add my own observations and experiences and advice

994
01:05:45,718 --> 01:05:47,480
And leave it in the library for some 

995
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,633
Other hapless virgin in the class below us.

996
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:53,803
But I had no idea it had been passed down for 40 years.

997
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:56,640
Your book is a legend, Mr. Levenstein.

998
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:00,643
Do you have it here?

999
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:01,813
Yeah.

1000
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:03,561
May I see it?

1001
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:10,148
Oh, my.

1002
01:06:11,703 --> 01:06:12,782
Boys.

1003
01:06:14,456 --> 01:06:17,243
This is a real piece of history here.

1004
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:19,750
What happened to it?

1005
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:21,663
Well, that's why we're here.

1006
01:06:21,754 --> 01:06:22,999
The Bible kinda got ruined,

1007
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:27,039
So we wanna call everyone on the list and try to reconstruct it.

1008
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:34,428
Well, I think you boys might need some help.

1009
01:06:36,436 --> 01:06:38,083
Well, girls have the advantage,

1010
01:06:38,084 --> 01:06:40,350
because girls talk to each other,

1011
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,145
And don't kid yourself, they talk about the penis.

1012
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:46,650
Penis size, penis shape, the angle of the bend.

1013
01:06:46,988 --> 01:06:48,696
Whether it winks at you. they talk.

1014
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:50,521
Now, to really make love to a woman,

1015
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,696
You gotta really care about her.

1016
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:53,715
But...hey, sex is great,

1017
01:06:53,716 --> 01:06:56,735
But sex with someone you love? That's awesome.

1018
01:06:56,831 --> 01:06:58,575
Dude, that is so profound.

1019
01:06:58,666 --> 01:06:59,829
Telling you.

1020
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:01,791
Yeah, definitely gets lonely on the road.

1021
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:04,416
Sure, I made love to all kinds of different food groups.

1022
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:06,712
Did you ever try making love to a peanut-butter sandwich?

1023
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,080
Nothing comes close.

1024
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:09,255
What?

1025
01:07:09,344 --> 01:07:10,994
Well, maybe a deboned ham hock,

1026
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:13,591
But that takes a whole lot of prep.

1027
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:15,261
Bend your knees.

1028
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,137
Next time you spank it, sit Indian-Style.

1029
01:07:18,353 --> 01:07:20,096
You won't come, not in a million years.

1030
01:07:20,188 --> 01:07:22,893
Our sex organs are like musical instruments.

1031
01:07:22,982 --> 01:07:24,892
Sure, you can have any technician blow on your horn,

1032
01:07:24,984 --> 01:07:28,069
But to place your instrument into the hands of a true expert?

1033
01:07:28,154 --> 01:07:30,859
That, my young friend, is true harmony.

1034
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,906
Guys don't talk to each other

1035
01:07:32,992 --> 01:07:34,902
Because they view each other as competitors,

1036
01:07:34,994 --> 01:07:36,702
Which I think is crazy. You know?

1037
01:07:36,788 --> 01:07:37,938
Because men need to help each other and work together

1038
01:07:37,939 --> 01:07:40,239
To get laid.

1039
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:42,624
Noah Levenstein, class of '70.

1040
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,415
- Pete Sambrelli? - That's right, the Noah Levenstein.

1041
01:07:45,505 --> 01:07:46,536
Do you have a number for him?

1042
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:49,087
This is regarding his advice on the lubricants.

1043
01:07:49,175 --> 01:07:52,378
We found the tongue tornado in Regina.

1044
01:07:53,763 --> 01:07:55,970
You said bros befo' hos.

1045
01:07:56,057 --> 01:07:58,134
Isn't that what you said? bros befo' hos.

1046
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:00,055
And then you screwed my girlfriend.

1047
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:02,422
Well, so did the entire glee club, Carlito.

1048
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:03,181
What's your point?

1049
01:08:05,517 --> 01:08:08,850
It's all about chemistry, and confidence is the key.

1050
01:08:13,108 --> 01:08:15,777
R-e-s-p-e-c-t, you've heard that song, right?

1051
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:17,604
Boys, we got another confirmation.

1052
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:19,273
You gotta treat your lady right.

1053
01:08:19,364 --> 01:08:21,351
You've got to be gentle, kind 

1054
01:08:21,353 --> 01:08:24,192
And respectful to the one you love.

1055
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:26,945
- Who are you talking to? - Shut the fuck up.

1056
01:08:27,038 --> 01:08:28,865
This is how you get her really excited.

1057
01:08:28,957 --> 01:08:32,326
Stick your finger in her ass. Trust me.

1058
01:08:32,544 --> 01:08:34,667
Was that two fingers or one?

1059
01:08:35,463 --> 01:08:37,255
I'm sorry. Confidential matter.

1060
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,460
Phone, phone. Okay.

1061
01:08:41,052 --> 01:08:42,084
Then what happened?

1062
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:45,263
Hello. Yeah. Class of '77.

1063
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:46,891
Yeah, hold on. Let me get a pen.

1064
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,090
Pete O'donnell, please.

1065
01:08:48,852 --> 01:08:50,263
Who is this?

1066
01:08:51,146 --> 01:08:54,313
Mr O'donnell, this is Marshall Lubetski.

1067
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,234
I just wanted to talk to you about what you wrote in the Bible.

1068
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:01,316
You know, about having anal sex with Miss Johnson.

1069
01:09:13,502 --> 01:09:16,337
Thank you very much! Mark S.!

1070
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,512
This is not a sex manual.

1071
01:09:30,852 --> 01:09:33,390
It is a life manual.

1072
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:37,596
Now, I've been married for 35 years

1073
01:09:37,692 --> 01:09:41,227
And not just because I'm this handsome dude

1074
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:43,693
Who knows how to satisfy a woman.

1075
01:09:43,865 --> 01:09:47,945
I've been married 35 years because I love my wife

1076
01:09:48,036 --> 01:09:50,954
And I respect my wife.

1077
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:53,959
And whether it's Amsterdam or East Great Falls

1078
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:55,750
It all comes down to this.

1079
01:09:55,836 --> 01:09:59,703
If you're honest and treat a girl with respect,

1080
01:10:00,757 --> 01:10:03,722
Then whatever happens is meant to happen,

1081
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:06,463
Because it's all perfectly natural.

1082
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,644
Boys, I've prepared you for this quest.

1083
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:18,521
And before you lies the biggest test of your lives.

1084
01:10:27,284 --> 01:10:29,572
This book is a powerful weapon,

1085
01:10:31,955 --> 01:10:33,746
So use it for good

1086
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:36,662
Not evil.

1087
01:11:26,259 --> 01:11:27,338
Yes.

1088
01:11:34,142 --> 01:11:35,767
You still looking for the vacuum?

1089
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:38,937
No. I found it in Cody's room. So strange.

1090
01:11:39,022 --> 01:11:42,058
I mean, I just don't remember leaving it there.

1091
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,977
Losing my mind, clearly.

1092
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:46,607
Hey, mom, can I go on the ski trip?

1093
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,569
Yes.

1094
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,405
But no drinking, and if you do drink, no driving.

1095
01:11:54,496 --> 01:11:56,193
Don't worry. If I do anything wrong

1096
01:11:56,194 --> 01:11:57,891
I'm sure it'll end up on youtube, so.

1097
01:11:58,124 --> 01:12:00,117
Call you when I get there.

1098
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:21,188
Drinking round!

1099
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:32,278
- Deal me in. - What are you doing here?

1100
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:33,398
Katie.

1101
01:12:33,493 --> 01:12:35,818
I know. But what are you doing here?

1102
01:12:35,912 --> 01:12:38,403
- I wanna play. - Right.

1103
01:12:38,498 --> 01:12:40,128
Just deal her in, Stifler.

1104
01:12:40,129 --> 01:12:40,740
What's the big deal?

1105
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:42,494
Yeah, deal her in.

1106
01:12:48,884 --> 01:12:50,259
Hi, Nathan.

1107
01:12:53,096 --> 01:12:54,756
Thanks for the flowers.

1108
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:56,574
I'm sorry about being a jerk.

1109
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,299
And, for the record, I've learned my lesson.

1110
01:12:58,393 --> 01:13:01,347
I'm ready to respect you and support you on your pledge.

1111
01:13:01,438 --> 01:13:04,889
Really? But why?

1112
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:09,568
I'm in this for you. I'm not in it just to have sex.

1113
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:12,942
Well, I realised that I'm in this for you

1114
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:15,906
And if the pledge gets in the way of that

1115
01:13:15,907 --> 01:13:16,865
then how good can it really be?

1116
01:13:16,953 --> 01:13:19,126
Sounds like a good basis for the two

1117
01:13:19,126 --> 01:13:21,662
Of us to just relax and see what happens.

1118
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:24,615
Look. I bought a book.

1119
01:13:25,462 --> 01:13:27,454
I was thinking that we could

1120
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:29,255
Start on page one and then

1121
01:13:29,256 --> 01:13:30,963
see how far we get this weekend.

1122
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:33,960
The first three chapters are foreplay.

1123
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:39,097
You know, I've actually been reading a book, as well.

1124
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:42,220
Have you ever heard of the Tongue Tornado?

1125
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:44,355
Okay, let's go.

1126
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:50,977
This is supposed to be fun.

1127
01:13:51,363 --> 01:13:52,905
This isn't fun.

1128
01:13:53,073 --> 01:13:56,239
Just you wait. You possess wisdom now.

1129
01:13:56,993 --> 01:13:58,653
Trust in the book.

1130
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,103
I mean, what does that mean, anyway?

1131
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:07,294
Do you think I'm too clingy?

1132
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:09,746
No. no, of course not.

1133
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,714
Do you even know how to play poker?

1134
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,831
I know the game.

1135
01:14:12,926 --> 01:14:16,674
And I tell you what, if I lose, I'll take off all my clothes.

1136
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,760
Snap. Nice.

1137
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:22,345
And if I lose?

1138
01:14:22,727 --> 01:14:24,519
You apologise to me.

1139
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,806
- For what? Blowing you off?  - Yes.

1140
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:30,686
If it's not enough, it was my first time.

1141
01:14:30,902 --> 01:14:31,934
I deserve better.

1142
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:37,815
But if I win, not only do you apologise to me

1143
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:40,116
You gotta run through the snow naked.

1144
01:14:42,164 --> 01:14:45,034
- Yeah. - It's a deal.

1145
01:14:53,049 --> 01:14:55,208
Start stripping, sweetheart.

1146
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:57,170
It's not over yet.

1147
01:14:59,848 --> 01:15:01,342
Feeling lucky?

1148
01:15:03,351 --> 01:15:06,388
You better hope for a five on the river, baby.

1149
01:15:14,404 --> 01:15:16,729
She got the five! Unbelievable.

1150
01:15:18,241 --> 01:15:19,570
Oh, my god.

1151
01:15:21,244 --> 01:15:22,904
- Strip. - Hold on a second.

1152
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:24,490
- Strip. - Strip.

1153
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:27,535
 strip! strip! strip! strip!

1154
01:15:27,626 --> 01:15:32,703
Strip! strip! strip! strip!

1155
01:15:32,797 --> 01:15:35,882
You want me to strip? You want some of this?

1156
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:39,547
It's time to get it going, baby!

1157
01:15:41,348 --> 01:15:44,349
All right, let's go! here we go, baby.

1158
01:15:45,977 --> 01:15:48,100
Wait, let's talk this over.

1159
01:15:50,398 --> 01:15:53,352
Shit. it's freezing out here.

1160
01:15:53,527 --> 01:15:55,069
Now apologise.

1161
01:15:55,362 --> 01:15:57,153
- I'm sorry. - For what?

1162
01:15:57,531 --> 01:16:00,022
I'm sorry for not calling you afterwards.

1163
01:16:00,116 --> 01:16:01,361
And what else?

1164
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:03,859
I'm sorry for being a dick, okay?

1165
01:16:04,246 --> 01:16:06,369
Now, open the stinking door.

1166
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:19,009
Open the door!

1167
01:16:19,094 --> 01:16:23,590
Now, tell everyone how you cry like a little girl after you come.

1168
01:16:23,682 --> 01:16:26,255
I cry like a girl after I come, okay?

1169
01:16:26,977 --> 01:16:29,432
It's a very intense experience for me.

1170
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:36,356
Call 911 .

1171
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,839
Hey, I'll meet you at the lodge later.

1172
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,211
Yeah, yeah, sure. go.

1173
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:54,760
Heidi. Wait up.

1174
01:18:02,986 --> 01:18:05,441
Do you mind if I ride up with you?

1175
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:06,943
Okay.

1176
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,266
Hey. What's up?

1177
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:42,273
We...we're in the same gondola.

1178
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,610
Yeah, look at that.

1179
01:18:56,206 --> 01:18:57,486
Oh, god.

1180
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:15,849
I didn't sleep with Stifler.

1181
01:19:15,934 --> 01:19:17,642
Yeah. I heard.

1182
01:19:18,812 --> 01:19:20,934
- But you still hate me? - No.

1183
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,516
No. Why would you say that?

1184
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:27,693
You haven't said a word to me since that night.

1185
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,355
I know. I'm sorry.

1186
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:35,025
I guess I just... I needed time to work through my feelings.

1187
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:43,244
And? What did you decide?

1188
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:48,225
Gibbs says that Stifler has to sit

1189
01:19:48,225 --> 01:19:50,248
On a foam rubber doughnut for six weeks.

1190
01:19:50,343 --> 01:19:52,089
And he says they're talking about 

1191
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,127
Amputating his feet from frostbite.

1192
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:57,389
Gibbs is a liar. Stifler doesn't need amputation.

1193
01:19:57,475 --> 01:20:00,049
That's too bad. I got an A in shop.

1194
01:20:05,859 --> 01:20:07,732
Oh, my. Was that a snort?

1195
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,995
Come to gloat?

1196
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,208
No. Just looking for a fag.

1197
01:20:26,379 --> 01:20:30,080
Just 'cause I took a moose pickle up my ass doesn't mean I'm gay.

1198
01:20:30,175 --> 01:20:33,010
Very funny. How's your bum?

1199
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:37,222
Feels like I gave birth to a mayonnaise jar, but thanks for asking.

1200
01:20:37,974 --> 01:20:41,094
Hey, I heard about your boyfriend. that really sucks.

1201
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:44,389
Yeah. I thought only high school boys were jerks.

1202
01:20:44,481 --> 01:20:46,188
It turns out they never outgrow it.

1203
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,732
Lmogen, no offence, and

1204
01:20:47,732 --> 01:20:49,975
you're the most mature girl I know,

1205
01:20:50,653 --> 01:20:54,568
But a 24-year-old dude isn't gonna take a high-school girl seriously.

1206
01:20:54,657 --> 01:20:56,068
I suppose not.

1207
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,903
You wanna sit down?

1208
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:00,824
What for?

1209
01:21:00,997 --> 01:21:03,951
I just thought we could both use a friend right now.

1210
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:17,669
Stifler.

1211
01:21:17,764 --> 01:21:19,306
My bad. reflex.

1212
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:23,810
I'm sorry.

1213
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:25,509
You have to make your own decisions.

1214
01:21:25,605 --> 01:21:29,555
You know, I just... I thought we had something.

1215
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:30,896
We did.

1216
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:33,768
We do.

1217
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:36,615
I was scared.

1218
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:38,570
Of what?

1219
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,121
I really like you.

1220
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,950
And I want it to be special.

1221
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:52,545
I guess I just wanted to be ready.

1222
01:21:54,551 --> 01:21:58,963
So you almost had sex with stifler so you'd be ready for me.

1223
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,469
Yeah.

1224
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:05,227
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1225
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:08,886
Well, I heard you got some practise.

1226
01:22:09,566 --> 01:22:12,483
You know, the truth is, is nothing happened.

1227
01:22:14,445 --> 01:22:17,233
I didn't want it to be random like that.

1228
01:22:17,448 --> 01:22:18,647
And...

1229
01:22:21,411 --> 01:22:25,455
I couldn't picture my first time being with anybody else but you.

1230
01:22:45,935 --> 01:22:47,430
What was that?

1231
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:49,812
I don't know.

1232
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:55,108
- Looks like we're stuck. - Yeah.

1233
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:04,367
You know, we could be up here for a while.

1234
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:05,533
Yeah.

1235
01:23:31,648 --> 01:23:33,439
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1236
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:35,233
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1237
01:23:35,318 --> 01:23:37,856
Why do you hook up with assholes like scott stifler anyway?

1238
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:40,234
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

1239
01:23:40,323 --> 01:23:43,490
You know, you're just the same as all the rest.

1240
01:23:43,576 --> 01:23:44,739
I'm just some sort of trophy to you.

1241
01:23:44,828 --> 01:23:47,283
You don't care about me. You just wanna sleep with me,

1242
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:50,207
Because you think it's some sort of status symbol.

1243
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,454
Sorry.

1244
01:23:53,878 --> 01:23:54,910
God.

1245
01:23:56,506 --> 01:23:58,878
How long are we gonna be up here?

1246
01:24:00,718 --> 01:24:02,213
I'll get help.

1247
01:24:03,847 --> 01:24:05,257
What are you doing?

1248
01:24:05,348 --> 01:24:08,100
It's not that far down, and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.

1249
01:24:08,184 --> 01:24:10,177
What, is this supposed to impress me?

1250
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,309
The thought had crossed my mind.

1251
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:14,473
Absolutely not. first of all, it's just wrong.

1252
01:24:14,566 --> 01:24:16,854
Second of all, you're not even supposed to touch the door.

1253
01:24:16,943 --> 01:24:18,403
And third, it's just really dangerous, okay?

1254
01:24:18,403 --> 01:24:21,190
So just get away from there.

1255
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:23,736
Right. What was I thinking?

1256
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,625
Are you okay?

1257
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,204
I think I hurt my leg.

1258
01:24:36,754 --> 01:24:37,869
Idiot.

1259
01:24:53,229 --> 01:24:54,723
Are you okay?

1260
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:57,191
Are you crazy?

1261
01:24:58,359 --> 01:24:59,818
Are you okay?

1262
01:25:00,445 --> 01:25:03,648
Yeah, I'm fine. no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1263
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:07,275
About what you said about how I don't care about you

1264
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:10,120
And you're just a trophy, that's actually not true.

1265
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:14,748
I really like you. We went to elementary school together.

1266
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:18,209
I remember when you sang Hey Ya! in the sixth-grade talent show.

1267
01:25:18,296 --> 01:25:21,588
I remember when you fell off the pyramid at the homecoming game

1268
01:25:21,588 --> 01:25:22,424
Freshman year.

1269
01:25:22,509 --> 01:25:25,379
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

1270
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:29,254
I just liked how you played it off like it was all part of the routine.

1271
01:25:29,349 --> 01:25:33,025
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe,

1272
01:25:33,025 --> 01:25:35,932
But I actually like you for you.

1273
01:25:38,107 --> 01:25:40,812
Look, this may be a shock to you,

1274
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:45,149
But I have no idea what I'm doing with girls.

1275
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:48,199
But I really wanna learn.

1276
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,033
You just give me a chance.

1277
01:25:50,954 --> 01:25:52,827
That's all I'm asking.

1278
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:57,537
And I guarantee that I will make it my life's mission

1279
01:25:57,627 --> 01:26:00,961
To satisfy you in every way possible.

1280
01:26:37,584 --> 01:26:40,205
- Let's go back to the... - to the cabin.

1281
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,265
Dude. You forgot to sign it.

1282
01:27:47,821 --> 01:27:50,394
You sure we can't just keep it for one more year?

1283
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:52,482
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.

1284
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:38,491
Rob on computer. This is my little brother, Cody,

1285
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,614
And this is what he does with the vacuum every day.

1286
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:45,542
No! hey! no!

1287
01:28:46,045 --> 01:28:49,130
Help! it's stuck! I can't get it off!

1288
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:53,250
Help! Help! it's stuck.

1289
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:55,049
Gotcha.

1290
01:28:56,347 --> 01:28:57,462
Help!

1291
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:01,800
No!

1292
01:29:05,356 --> 01:29:10,018
She was using me. l...that was really bad.

1293
01:29:10,403 --> 01:29:12,811
Father, why hast thou forsaken me?

1294
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:16,367
Wanna suck me off in the sharper lmage?

1295
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:19,329
Rob, are you some kind of jive turkey?

1296
01:29:21,372 --> 01:29:24,409
He's like an inch away from the real McCoy.

1297
01:29:25,084 --> 01:29:26,958
Did you bring condoms?

1298
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:28,207
What?

1299
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:31,416
I wet the bed until I was 13 years old, okay?

1300
01:29:31,549 --> 01:29:34,087
You nancy boys couldn't get lucky at a Jonas Brothers concert

1301
01:29:34,177 --> 01:29:36,300
With a fistful of backstage passes.

1302
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:40,428
Faith in god and his promise of eternal life.

1303
01:29:42,018 --> 01:29:44,972
Now, put the condom on the banana.

1304
01:29:46,022 --> 01:29:49,687
Who didn't see that coming? Look at the time. gotta go.

1305
01:29:50,735 --> 01:29:53,487
I think that is quite enough pictures of the cheerleaders.

1306
01:29:53,571 --> 01:29:55,030
How about we get some of the game?

1307
01:29:56,533 --> 01:29:57,612
We're eating.

1308
01:29:59,744 --> 01:30:02,152
You've been fucking americans or...

1309
01:30:02,789 --> 01:30:04,497
Watching, loving...

1310
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:09,200
Bear with me.

1311
01:30:09,295 --> 01:30:12,166
If she's down, bring her flowers.

1312
01:30:12,465 --> 01:30:14,956
If she's thirsty, serve her fine champagne.

1313
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:17,423
Yeah, 'cause, I'm telling you, my wife is pretty effing hot.

1314
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:20,963
I'm talking a tight, tight ass and squeaky clean.

1315
01:30:21,808 --> 01:30:24,513
Is that cream-filled? You rock.

1316
01:30:25,103 --> 01:30:27,261
Oh. Don't mention that, okay?

1317
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:29,041
And whenever it comes to making out, 

1318
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:32,310
Put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.
