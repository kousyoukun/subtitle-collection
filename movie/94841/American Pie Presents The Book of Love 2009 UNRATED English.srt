talking about non-stop all the time?

781

He doesn't attend high-school parties.

782

Sounds like you might be in the market
for some home-grown American beef.

Just give it to her nice and slow at first.

793

- Sorry.

800
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:39,048
- I can't find Heidi anywhere.
- Maybe she didn't come.

No, no. Her car is outside.

when you can get a perfect 10?

Okay, whatever you say, man. Good luck.

Honey, I know that I can't stop you
from doing certain things,

942
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,078
but I can insist that you are safe.

943

944

No. John Costello drove me home.

Well, I want you to know that if
you find yourself in any carnal situation,

946
01:02:44,726 --> 01:02:47,266
that you...You will use protection.

947
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:49,767
What do you mean by carnal?

948
01:02:52,448 --> 01:02:53,480

- Vomit girl.

ROB: I'm ready to give up.

960
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:32,289
I thought I had the answers.

961
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:36,079
It's too bad that 99% of the bible's
completely unreadable.

962
01:03:38,009 --> 01:03:39,338
That's it.

963
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:42,176
We need to reconstruct the bible.

964
01:03:42,263 --> 01:03:43,343
Why?

965
01:03:43,431 --> 01:03:44,842
The secrets are in there.

966
01:03:44,933 --> 01:03:47,850
I mean, there's no one single answer
to getting laid.

967
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:49,893
Right? We need the whole book
to understand.

968
01:03:49,979 --> 01:03:52,056
Probably has a lot of crap in there
that we need to know, too,

969
01:03:52,148 --> 01:03:55,149
like positions, techniques,
angle of insertion.

970
01:03:55,235 --> 01:03:59,446
Exactly. That's what the bible was
created for, to help guys like us.

971
01:03:59,614 --> 01:04:02,734
And we owe it to the others.
I ruined the bible.

972

to restore its wisdom.

973

<i>I'm calling from
East Great Falls High School.</i>

986
01:04:50,206 --> 01:04:54,251
NOAH: It was the summer
of my junior year, 1969,

987
01:04:54,335 --> 01:04:57,087
and my buddies and I,
we take this trip to Amsterdam,

988
01:04:57,171 --> 01:05:01,086
where we run into a group
of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos

989
01:05:01,175 --> 01:05:05,387
who were willing to trade their bodies
for a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPs.

990
01:05:05,471 --> 01:05:09,968
Well, needless to say, we had ourselves
one super weekend with those gals,

991
01:05:10,184 --> 01:05:12,889
sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

992
01:05:13,688 --> 01:05:16,558
But the sad news was,
we had no idea what we were doing.

993
01:05:16,649 --> 01:05:18,393
We had no technique.

994
01:05:18,776 --> 01:05:21,528
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

995
01:05:21,612 --> 01:05:24,566
and we run into this Dutch hooker
in the red-light district,

996
01:05:24,657 --> 01:05:27,065
and she tells us about this book.

997
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:33,286
It was a sex manual, evidently written
in the 19th century by some priest.

998
01:05:33,374 --> 01:05:35,746
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

999
01:05:35,835 --> 01:05:38,291
and then when we got back
to East Great Falls,

1000
01:05:38,379 --> 01:05:41,131
I had the bright idea to write my own book

1001
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:45,260
and add my own observations
and experiences and advice

1002
01:05:45,344 --> 01:05:49,259
and leave it in the library for some
other hapless virgin in the class below us.

1003
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:53,429
But I had no idea it had been
passed down for 40 years.

1004
01:05:53,644 --> 01:05:56,266
Your book is a legend, Mr Levenstein.

1005
01:05:58,774 --> 01:06:00,269

1006
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:01,439

1011

This is a real piece of history here.

1012
01:06:17,585 --> 01:06:19,376
What happened to it?

1013
01:06:19,545 --> 01:06:21,289
Well, that's why we're here.

1014
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,625
The bible kinda got ruined,

1015
01:06:22,715 --> 01:06:26,665
so we wanna call everyone on the list
and try to reconstruct it.

1016

Well, I think you boys might need
some help.

1018
01:06:36,062 --> 01:06:39,976
Well, girls have the advantage,
because girls talk to each other,

1019
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:42,770
and don't kid yourself,
they talk about the penis.

1020
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,276
Penis size, penis shape,
the angle of the bend.

1021
01:06:46,614 --> 01:06:48,322
Whether it winks at you. They talk.

1022
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:52,322
Now, to really make love to a woman,
you gotta really care about her.

1023
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:56,361
But...Hey, sex is great, but sex with
someone you love? That's awesome.

1026
01:06:59,543 --> 01:07:01,417

of different food groups.

to a peanut-butter sandwich?

NOAH: Guys don't talk to each other

1040
01:07:32,618 --> 01:07:34,527
because they view each other
as competitors,

1041
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,328
which I think is crazy. You know?

ROB: You still looking for the vacuum?

1094
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:38,965
No. I found it in Cody's room. So strange.

1095
01:11:39,051 --> 01:11:42,085
I mean, I just don't remember
leaving it there.

1096
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:44,002
(LAUGHS) Losing my mind, clearly.

1097
01:11:44,094 --> 01:11:46,630
Hey, Mom, can I go on the ski trip?

1098
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:49,590
Yes.

1099
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:54,423
But no drinking,
and if you do drink, no driving.

1100
01:11:54,513 --> 01:11:58,046
Don't worry. If I do anything wrong,
I'm sure it'll end up on YouTube, so...

1101
01:11:58,139 --> 01:12:00,131
Call you when I get there.

- Deal me in.
- What are you doing here?

1106
01:12:32,357 --> 01:12:33,388
Katie.

1107
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:35,806
I know. But what are you doing here?

1108
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,389
- I wanna play.
- Right.

1109
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:40,724
Just deal her in, Stifler. What's the big deal?

1110
01:12:40,818 --> 01:12:42,477
AMY: Yeah, deal her in.

1111
01:12:48,862 --> 01:12:50,236
Hi, Nathan.

1112
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:54,730
Thanks for the flowers.

1113
01:12:54,822 --> 01:12:58,271
I'm sorry about being a jerk.
And, for the record, I've learned my lesson.

1114
01:12:58,364 --> 01:13:01,316
I'm ready to respect you
and support you on your pledge.

1115
01:13:01,407 --> 01:13:04,856
Really? But why?

1116
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,531
I'm in this for you.
I'm not in it just to have sex.

1117
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:12,903
Well, I realised that I'm in this for you,

1118
01:13:12,994 --> 01:13:16,823
and if the pledge gets in the way of that,
then how good can it really be?

1119
01:13:16,911 --> 01:13:21,617
Sounds like a good basis for the two of us
to just relax and see what happens.

1120
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:24,568
Look. I bought a book.

1121
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:27,405
I was thinking that we could

1122
01:13:27,498 --> 01:13:30,911
start on page one
and then see how far we get this weekend.

1123
01:13:31,749 --> 01:13:33,906
The first three chapters are foreplay.

1124
01:13:33,999 --> 01:13:35,078
Wow.

1125
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:39,039
You know, I've actually been
reading a book, as well.

1126
01:13:39,126 --> 01:13:42,160
Have you ever heard of the tongue tornado?

1127
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,293
Okay, let's go.

1128
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:50,910
This is supposed to be fun.

1129

This isn't fun.

Just you wait. You possess wisdom now.

1131

Trust in the book.

1132
01:14:03,174 --> 01:14:07,216
I mean, what does that mean, anyway?
Do you think I'm too clingy?

1133
01:14:07,425 --> 01:14:09,665
No. No, of course not.

1134
01:14:10,009 --> 01:14:11,633
Do you even know how to play poker?

1135
01:14:11,718 --> 01:14:12,749
KATIE: I know the game.

1136
01:14:12,843 --> 01:14:16,589

You apologise to me.

- KATIE: Yes.

- I'm sorry.
- For what?

1168
01:15:57,673 --> 01:16:00,157
I'm sorry for not calling you afterwards.

1169

And what else?

1170
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:03,985
I'm sorry for being a dick, okay?

Yeah. I heard.

01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,832
- But you still hate me?
- No.

1193
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:24,414
No. Why would you say that?

1194
01:19:24,507 --> 01:19:27,591
You haven't said a word to me
since that night.

1195
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,253
I know. I'm sorry.

1196
01:19:31,138 --> 01:19:34,922
I guess I just...
I needed time to work through my feelings.

1197
01:19:40,105 --> 01:19:43,141
And? What did you decide?

1198
01:19:46,444 --> 01:19:50,144
Gibbs says that Stifler has to sit on
a foam rubber doughnut for six weeks.

1199
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:54,023
And he says they're talking about
amputating his feet from frostbite.

1200
01:19:54,118 --> 01:19:57,284
Gibbs is a liar.
Stifler doesn't need amputation.

1201
01:19:57,371 --> 01:19:59,944
That's too bad. I got an A in Shop.

Come to gloat?

01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:26,102
No. Just looking for a fag.

1206
01:20:26,273 --> 01:20:29,973
Just 'cause I took a moose pickle up my ass
doesn't mean I'm gay.

1207

Very funny. How's your bum?

1208
01:20:32,987 --> 01:20:37,115
Feels like I gave birth to a mayonnaise jar,
but thanks for asking.

1209
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:40,986
Hey, I heard about your boyfriend.
That really sucks.

1210
01:20:41,078 --> 01:20:44,281
Yeah. I thought only high school boys
were jerks.

1211
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,081
It turns out they never outgrow it.

1212
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:49,866
Lmogen, no offence,
and you're the most mature girl I know,

1213
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:54,459
but a 24-year-old dude isn't gonna take
a high-school girl seriously.

1214
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,960
I suppose not.

1215
01:20:57,051 --> 01:20:58,795
You wanna sit down?

1216
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:00,715
What for?

1217
01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:03,842
I just thought we could both use
a friend right now.

1218
01:21:16,528 --> 01:21:17,559
Stifler.

1219
01:21:17,654 --> 01:21:19,196
My bad. Reflex.

ROB: I'm sorry.

1222
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:25,399
You have to make your own decisions.

1223
01:21:25,494 --> 01:21:29,444
You know, I just...
I thought we had something.

1224
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:30,785
We did.

1225
01:21:32,459 --> 01:21:33,657
We do.

1226
01:21:35,045 --> 01:21:36,504
I was scared.

1227
01:21:37,214 --> 01:21:38,459
Of what?

1228
01:21:42,385 --> 01:21:44,010
I really like you.

1229
01:21:45,513 --> 01:21:47,838
And I want it to be special.

1230
01:21:49,267 --> 01:21:52,433
I guess I just wanted to be ready.

1231
01:21:54,438 --> 01:21:58,851
So you almost had sex with Stifler
so you'd be ready for me.

1232
01:22:00,277 --> 01:22:01,356
Yeah.

1233
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:05,114
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1234
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:08,772
Well, I heard you got some practise.

1235
01:22:09,452 --> 01:22:12,369
You know, the truth is,
is nothing happened.

1236
01:22:14,332 --> 01:22:17,119
I didn't want it to be random like that.

1237
01:22:17,334 --> 01:22:18,532
And...

1238
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:25,341
I couldn't picture my first time
being with anybody else but you.

1239
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:47,313
What was that?

1240
01:22:48,071 --> 01:22:49,696
I don't know.

1241
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,991
- Looks like we're stuck.
- Yeah.

1242
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:04,250
You know, we could be up here for a while.

1243
01:23:04,337 --> 01:23:05,416
Yeah.

1244
01:23:31,529 --> 01:23:33,320
LUBE: Hey, can I ask you a question?

1245
01:23:33,405 --> 01:23:35,113
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1246
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,736
Why do you hook up with assholes
like Scott Stifler anyway?

1247
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:40,115
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

1248
01:23:40,203 --> 01:23:43,370
(SCOFFS) You know,
you're just the same as all the rest.

1249
01:23:43,456 --> 01:23:44,619
I'm just some sort of trophy to you.

1250
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:47,163
You don't care about me.
You just wanna sleep with me,

1251
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:50,087
because you think
it's some sort of status symbol.

1252
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:51,334
Sorry.

1253
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:53,669
(ASHLEY SIGHS)

1254
01:23:53,758 --> 01:23:54,789
God.

1255
01:23:56,385 --> 01:23:58,757
How long are we gonna be up here?

1256
01:24:00,597 --> 01:24:02,091
I'll get help.

1257
01:24:03,725 --> 01:24:05,136
ASHLEY: What are you doing?

1258
01:24:05,227 --> 01:24:07,978
It's not that far down,
and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.

1259
01:24:08,063 --> 01:24:10,055
What, is this supposed to impress me?

1260
01:24:10,148 --> 01:24:12,187
The thought had crossed my mind.

1261
01:24:12,275 --> 01:24:14,351
Absolutely not. First of all, it's just wrong.

1262
01:24:14,444 --> 01:24:16,732
Second of all,
you're not even supposed to touch the door.

1263
01:24:16,821 --> 01:24:21,068
And third, it's just really dangerous, okay?
So just get away from there.

1264
01:24:21,158 --> 01:24:23,614
Right. What was I thinking?

1265
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:28,618
Whoa!

1266
01:24:28,707 --> 01:24:30,367
(ASHLEY SCREAMING)

1267
01:24:32,127 --> 01:24:33,502
Are you okay?

1268
01:24:33,586 --> 01:24:35,081
I think I hurt my leg.

1269
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:36,416
(SIGHS)

1270
01:24:36,631 --> 01:24:37,746
Idiot.

1271
01:24:53,105 --> 01:24:54,599
Are you okay?

1272
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:57,066
Are you crazy?

1273
01:24:58,234 --> 01:24:59,693
Are you okay?

1274
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,523
Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1275
01:25:03,614 --> 01:25:07,149
About what you said
about how I don't care about you

1276
01:25:07,243 --> 01:25:09,994
and you're just a trophy,
that's actually not true.

1277
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,622
I really like you.
We went to elementary school together.

1278
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:18,083
<i>I remember when you sang Hey Ya!
In the sixth-grade talent show.</i>

1279
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:22,298
I remember when you fell off the pyramid
at the homecoming game, freshman year.

1280
01:25:22,382 --> 01:25:25,252
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

1281
01:25:25,426 --> 01:25:29,127
I just liked how you played it off
like it was all part of the routine.

1282
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:35,805
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe,
but I actually like you for you.

1283
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,684
Look, this may be a shock to you,

1284
01:25:40,774 --> 01:25:45,021
but I have no idea what I'm doing with girls.

1285
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:49,904
But I really wanna learn.
You just give me a chance.

1286
01:25:50,825 --> 01:25:52,699
That's all I'm asking.

1287
01:25:53,411 --> 01:25:57,408
And I guarantee that
I will make it my life's mission

1288
01:25:57,498 --> 01:26:00,831
to satisfy you in every way possible.

1289
01:26:37,452 --> 01:26:40,073
- Let's go back to the...
- To the cabin.

1290
01:27:37,425 --> 01:27:40,129
Dude. You forgot to sign it.

1291
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,257
You sure we can't just keep it
for one more year?

1292
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:52,346
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.

No!

1302
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:09,876
She was using me. l...That was really bad.

1303
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:12,669
Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?

1304
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:16,225
Wanna suck me off in the Sharper lmage?

1305
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,186
Rob, are you some kind of jive turkey?

1306
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:24,266
He's like an inch away from the real McCoy.

1307
01:29:24,941 --> 01:29:26,815
Did you bring condoms?

1308
01:29:26,985 --> 01:29:28,064
What?

1309
01:29:28,153 --> 01:29:31,272
I wet the bed until I was 13 years old, okay?

1310
01:29:31,406 --> 01:29:33,944
You nancy boys couldn't get lucky
at a Jonas Brothers concert

1311
01:29:34,033 --> 01:29:36,156
with a fistful of backstage passes.

<i>Faith in God and His promise of eternal life.</i>

1313
01:29:41,874 --> 01:29:44,828
Now, put the condom on the banana.

1314
01:29:45,878 --> 01:29:49,543
Who didn't see that coming?
Look at the time. Gotta go.

1315
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:53,342
I think that is quite enough pictures
of the cheerleaders.

1316
01:29:53,426 --> 01:29:54,885
How about we get some of the game?

1317
01:29:56,387 --> 01:29:57,467

If she's thirsty, serve her fine champagne.

Yeah, 'cause, I'm telling you,
my wife is pretty effing hot.
