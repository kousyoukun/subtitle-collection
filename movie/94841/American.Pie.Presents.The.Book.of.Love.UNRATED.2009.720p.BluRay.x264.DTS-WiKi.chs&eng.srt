3
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:28,820

00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:38,119
你们就会知道为什么他们叫我操练军官
You're gonna find out why they call me the drill sergeant.

8
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:32,974
真爽  宝贝
That's... that's nice, baby.

9
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:37,851
不要  卷毛  不要

15
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,059

16
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:19,140

17
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:21,313
-卷毛  -对
-Frizzy. - Right.

18
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,846
如果你的家庭是特殊物种的话  
It's not technically incest 

19
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,150
理论上不算是乱伦
If your family member's a different species.

20
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,030
所以  你跟达娜有什么进展吗
So, are you getting close with Dana yet?

21
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:29,654
谣言是真的  她发誓禁欲
The rumours are true. She's taken the pledge.

22
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:32,281
禁欲  你对她可是很有把握的啊
No sex? She was your sure thing.

23
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:36,031
-信念夏令营的宣传  伙计  她等结婚后再做爱
-Faith-camp propaganda, man. She's waiting until marriage.

24
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,290
我以为她和六个男生做过爱
I thought she had sex with six guys.

25
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,413
怎么了
What?

26
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:46,873

00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,131
走廊上不准用手机  艾莉森

33
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:08,905
我得先看看日程表  变态...皮特

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,953
不要  不要  不要  卷毛  不要  卷毛
No, no, no, Frizzy! No! Frizzy!

35
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,783
看  看  看这个
Look. Look. Look at that.

36
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,828
不要 不要 不要 卷毛  不要 卷毛
No, no, no, Frizzy! No! Frizzy!

37

- Hey, just ignore them. -Oh, god. You saw it, too?

38
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,899
你知道 那不是 
Just so you know, it's not at all... 

39
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,467
不要紧
Hey, don't worry about it.

40
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:34,385
卷毛是只很好看的狗
Frizzy's a good-looking dog.

41
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:38,802
所以  你想做吗  我们上吗
So, do you wanna do it? Are we on?

42
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,476
罗伯  罗伯  我们上不上第七节课吗
Rob? Rob? Are we on for seventh period?

43
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,100

Yeah. l...i'll...

44
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:49,104

混蛋

59
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,639
你知道  我是认真发誓的
I'm serious about this pledge, you know.

60
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,847
我知道

00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:44,972
-所以今晚我只跳舞  -行  只跳舞

横向呼啦舞
The horizontal hula.

63
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,768
内森
Nathan.

64
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,230
可怜的内森
Poor Nathan.

65
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:59,947
他的小弟弟肯定硬得能够割草了
His willy must be hard enough to cut glass by now.

66
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:02,409
内森爱我  也很尊重我
Nathan loves me, and nathan respects me.

67
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:06,745
一  男人永远不会尊重一个不要性爱的女人
Okay. A, a guy never respects a girl enough to give up sex.

68
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,120
二  那你呢
And, B, well, what about you?

69
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:12,209
你现在肯定觉得性欲特强吧 达娜
You must be feeling pretty randy by now, Dana.

70
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:15,582
好吧  可能有那么一点点吧
Okay, well, yeah, maybe, like, the tiniest bit,

71
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:18,133
但我真觉得自己有极强的控制力
But I really feel like I'm connecting with the higher power here.

72
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,795
是  我知道  这非常好啊
Yes, I know, and that is totally fab,

73
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:24,260
我就不行了  我太热衷于口交了
But I know I couldn't do it. I'm way too into giving blow jobs.

74
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,306
问问理查德就知道了
Ask Richard.

75
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,223
别听伊莫金的好吗
Hey, don't listen to Lmogen, okay?

76
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:32,317
性爱还是很重要的  如果你觉得还没准备好
Sex is a really big deal, and if you feel like you're not ready,

77
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:34,561
那我认为你应该再等等
Then I think you should wait.

78
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:37,319
但是
But...

79
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,777
无意冒犯  海蒂  你根本不知道自己在说什么
No offence,Heidi, but you have no idea what you're talking about.

80
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,747
等下给我发短信
Text me later.

81
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,749
-嘿  罗伯  -怎么了
-Hey, Rob. -Yeah?

82
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,465
-我可以问你一些事吗  -当然  什么事
-Can I ask you something? - Sure. What's up?

83
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,546
个人的一些事情
Well, it's kind of personal.

84
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,760
没问题
Okay.

85
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:07,433
我一直在想  你知道我还是处女吧
I've been thinking. You know I'm a virgin, right?

86
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,809
只是  我不知道
It's just...I don't know.

87
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,224
好像别人已经做过一百万次爱了
Everyone's already done it like a million times already,

88
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:15,775
我知道我还没有男朋友  但是
And I know I don't have a boyfriend or whatever, but...

89
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,862
有时候我感觉我应该去试试
But sometimes I feel like I should just get it over with.

90
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,161
你知道吗   我是说我想破处
You know? I mean, just get past this whole thing, this virgin.

91
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,822
那到底是什么意思呢
What does that even mean, anyway?

92
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,492
还没有小弟弟插进过我阴道  但是那又怎样
So I've never had a penis in my vagina, but so what?

93
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,204
为什么我要记得这些事  比如  她太单纯了
Why do I have to label everything? like, "She's too innocent."

94
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,744
肯定不能做爱
She can't handle it.

95
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:36,298
我一点都不单纯
I'm not that innocent.

96
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,672
我看过《脱衣舞娘》和《蓝色珊瑚》
I've seen Showgirls and Blue Lagoon.

97
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:45,718
总之  我决定去试试  你觉得怎么样
Anyways, I think I've decided to just do it. But what do you think?

98
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:51,601
是啊  我觉得你应该把这事给做圆满了
Yeah. I think you should definitely go ahead and get it over with.

99
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,476
谢了
Thanks.

100
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,071
回到学习上去吧
Let's get back to work.

101
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:21,462

107
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,957
不错  不错  她看上去容易得手
All right, all right. She looks highly doable.

108
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:04,546
所以游戏计划是什么
All right, so what's the game plan here?

109
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,548
我不知道  我想应该请她跳舞  
I don't know. Ask her to dance, I guess.

110
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,679
你得有个计划  知道吗  
You need a plan, all right? 

111
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,092
这样你才能建立目标
It's all about establishing your intentions.

112
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:13,270
看  现在  她只觉得你是个朋友
See, right now, she thinks of you as just a friend.

113
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:15,106
你需要打破这个形象
You need to break that paradigm.

114
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:18,809
记住  朋友不会让朋友只是朋友
Remember, friends don't let friends just be friends.

115
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:21,738
-没错  -我说真的  你别搞黄了
-Right. - I'm serious. you cannot puss out here.

116
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,492
知道了 别紧张   我会去跟她说的
All right, take it easy. I'm gonna go talk to her.

117
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,573
等等  难道你没忘记什么吗
Wait. Aren't you forgetting something?

118
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,291
这里  可别忘了这个
Here, don't forget these.

119
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:37,292
这是你孤单的时候需要的东西
You only need those when you're alone.

120
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,583
对  对  好吧

121
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,605
-好了  -什么  怎么了

122
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,969
我不能
I can't.

123
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:59,149
-才到二垒  -我知道  但是如果我们进行到那里
-But it's only second base. -I know. But if we go there,

124
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,311
我们会更深入进去的
Then we're gonna wanna go further.

125
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,189
可亚当和夏娃都做爱了
But Adam and Eve did it.

126

来吧
Come here.

129
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:20,833
那上帝接受口交吗
Is god okay with a blow job?

130
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,298
我以为你知道我有多在乎这件事
I thought you understood how I felt about this.

131
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:26,639
我告诉你  结婚前
I told you, it's important for me 

132
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,173
保持贞操对我来说很重要
To save myself until marriage.

133
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,841
你都跟七个男生做过了
You've had sex with seven guys.

134
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:36,642
是六个  不是七个
And it was six, not seven!

135
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:39,429
其中一人是黑人  他一人顶两人
Well, one was a black guy, so he counts as two.

136
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:41,557
达娜
Dana.

137
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,569
-达娜  别生气  -滚开

138
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,031

Hey, girls. This is gonna be for sit-on-my-face-book.

140
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,959
你们亲一下好吗
I need you to kiss one time, okay?

141
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:03,829
我不知道
I don't know.

142
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:07,128
来吧  数百万人会点击看的
Come on. It's gonna be seen by millions of people.

143
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:09,669
好吧
Okay.

144
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,430
好了 我们再来一次
Okay, we're gonna go again,

145
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,306
但是这一次   给爸爸伸出舌头
But this time, sneak in some tongue for daddy.

146
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,726
好吧
Okay.

147
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,820
我说的就是这样  宝贝
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

148
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:33,570
斯戴福尔再次袭来
Stifmeister strikes again!

149
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:36,577
伙计
Dude.

150
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,825
你肯定会喜欢这个  看看吧
You're gonna love this. Check this out.

151
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:43,749
是啊  所以呢
Yeah. So?

152
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:45,460
看着跟我学学
Watch and learn.

153
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:51,763
你真性感
"You're hot."

154
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,669
给我你的电话号码
"Give me your number "

155
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:58,737
一起出去玩吧
"And let's get together"

156
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,811
我把这个丢给一位辣妹
I throw this at a hot girl,

157
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,798
然后她很有兴趣   
And she's so impressed that 

158
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,316
我的阴谋就得逞了
I'm literally throwing around a benjamin

159
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,734
接着她会想认识认识我
That she wants to hook up with me.

160
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,361
好吧  祝你好运
Yeah. Good luck with that.

161
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,317
-我要去找达娜  -好吧 
-I'm gonna go find dana. -All right, man.

162
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,973
糟了
Oh, no.

163
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:42,808
天啊
Oh, god.

164
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:49,155
借过  借过  小心  有人要过去
Excuse me, excuse me, Watch out. Coming through.

165
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,067
我在想之前说的那些话  
So, I was thinking about what 

166
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:55,570
你知道之前那些
We were talking about, you know, before.

167
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:00,988
-是的  是的  我记得  -好  所以我想还等什么呢
-Yeah. Yeah, I remember. -Right. So I was thinking, why wait?

168
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,002
对吗   我是说你也想了却这么一桩事
Right? I mean, you might as well, you know, get it over with.

169
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:06,328
什么  在这里  舞会上吗
What? Like, here? At the dance?

170
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,331
通常都是在图书馆
Well, there's always the library.

171
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,177
-对  图书馆     -我开玩笑的
-Yeah, the library. - I'm kidding.

172
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:14,179
-我知道  -但是说真的  舞会完了之后
-Yeah. I know. -But seriously, after the dance,

173
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,342
我不知道是否你
I don't know if you...

174
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,852
-你在干什么  -找我的钱
-What are you doing? -Looking for my money.

175
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,518
-那一百块吗  -是的
-C-note thing? -Yeah.

176
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:25,897
-钱没了吗  -闭嘴
-Lose your money? -Shut up.

177
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:34,987
回神啦  怎么了  伙计  海蒂在哪
And we're back. What's up, dude? Where's Heidi?

178
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:38,031
我不知道
I don't know.

179
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:41,997
她几秒前还在这  可能上厕所去了
She was here a second ago. Maybe she went to the bathroom.

180
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,120
-是啊  可能     -达娜现在很生我气
-Yeah, maybe. -Dana's pissed at me.

181
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:47,786
伙计   你得陪着她守住誓言
Dude, you gotta play along with this whole pledge thing.

182
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,422
对你来说是简单
Well, that's easy for you to say.

183
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,215
你也没有真正搞到她啊
You haven't exactly broken the seal yet, either.

184
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,756
伙计  我平时都能打到三垒
Dude, I've been getting to third base on a regular basis.

185
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:56,051
而且我现在都不打飞机了
I can't go back to jacking off now.

186
00:13:56,138 --> 00:14:00,183
伙计  你用左手打飞机会有很不一样的感觉
Dude, just use your left hand. It feels completely different.

187
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,645
-我要去找海蒂   -我也去找达娜
-I'm gonna go find Heidi. -I'm gonna go find Dana.

188
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,083
小子 你差点把我推倒
No! dude, you're gonna make me hurl.

189
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,475
海蒂
Heidi?

190
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:52,351
不要  不要  不要 
No, no, no, no!

191
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,775
等等
Wait.

192
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:57,574
兄弟  嘿
Dude, yo.

193
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,775
你在干什么
What are you doing?

194
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,894
罗伯  你说
Rob? you said...

195
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:19,478
罗伯
Rob!

196
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,401
兄弟  来的真是时候
Dude, nice cock block.

197
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:29,623
我着火了
I'm on fire.

198
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,911
-我着火了  -天啊
- I'm on fire. -Oh, my god.

199
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:35,786
着火了  着火了  我身上着火了
There's a fire. there's a fire, and it's on me.

200
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,291
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

201
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:46,423
罗伯  罗伯  把它扑灭  把你裤子脱了  
Rob! Rob! put it out. Take off your pants! 

202
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:47,930
快脱了  把你裤子脱了
Take off...Take your pants off!

203
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,555
天啊
Oh, god!

204
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,346
快点
Come on!

205
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,853
我的天啊  我的天啊  我的天啊 
Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

206
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:59,434
快点  罗伯  快
Hurry, Rob, Come on.

207
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,648
把火熄灭   把火熄灭
Get it out! Get it out!

208
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:07,824
天啊
Oh, god.

209
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,659
该死的  发生什么事了
What the hell is going on in here?

210
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,537
为期两个月的每周六
Two months seems like an awfully 

211
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,084
留堂也太长了吧
Long time for saturday detention.

212
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:25,254
我们应该是去打扫图书馆
We're supposed to clean up the library.

213
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,971
你们知道吸尘器在哪吗
Do you guys know where the vacuum is?

214
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:29,220
不知道
Nope.

215
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:33,683
你当时到底在图书馆做什么
What were you doing in the library anyway?

216
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:36,724
什么都没做  当时海蒂已经在那了
I wasn't doing anything. Heidi was already in there.

217
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,734
-我只是去找她  -我听说她在帮某男口交
-I was just looking for her. -I heard she was blowing some dude.

218
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,017
科迪  如果你被留堂的话  
Cody! well, I don't know how you're 

219
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:43,817
我不知道
Gonna go on the school ski trip

220
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,318
你还怎么参加学校的滑雪旅行
If you're still on detention.

221
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:48,196
妈  我不懂两者有什么关系  我什么都没做
Mom, I don't see what that has to do with it. I didn't do anything.

222
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:49,828
我听说你就是那个男的
I heard you were the fluffer.

223
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,573
-科迪  -看  他的嘴唇都裂开了
-Cody. -Look. Lis lips are chapped.

224
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,162
再看吧
Well, we'll see.

225
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:58,660
好了  我要去准备一下了
All right. I have to go get ready.

226
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,250
可能吸尘器在仓库
Maybe it's in the garage.

227
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:09,841
罗伯  我想跟你谈谈
Rob? I wanna have a little chat with you.

228
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,221
我们有什么好谈的吗
Do we have to?

229
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:14,761
亲爱的  我知道你长大了
Honey, I know that you're growing older,

230
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:18,520
我不知道你爸爸跟你说过什么
And I don't know what your father has told you about things,

231
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:21,645
但是我觉得什么事都应该讨论讨论
But I think it's important to discuss everything, you know?

232
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,528
比如说性
Like about sex.

233
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:28,022
-你做过爱了吗  -妈  我不想讨论这个事
-Are you having sex? -Mom, I don't wanna talk about this.

234
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:32,827
不是  我只是在洗衣的时候找到条袜子  而且
No, well, it's just that I found this sock in the laundry, and, well...

235
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,697
天啊  妈  把它扔了
Oh, god, mom. Put that away.

236
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:43,413
还有  有人给我发了个视频的链接
And, also, somebody sent me a link to this video.

237
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:45,882
不要  不要  不要  卷毛  不要
No, no, no, Frizzy! No.

238
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,629
-妈  把那东西关了  -我不知道怎么关
-Mom, just turn it off! -I don't know how!

239
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,345
你弟弟帮我打开的
Your brother made it my start-up screen.

240
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,423
-好了  我能  我能弄好  -你能  太好了
-Okay, I can...I can fix that. You can? Great.

241
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,547
-好  -谢谢
-Yeah. -Thanks.

242
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,434
-不要  不要  卷毛  不要  -谢谢你了
-No, no, no, Frizzy! no! -Thank you for that.

243
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,144
-好吧  -所以我们讨论完了  对吗
-Okay. -And we're done. right? Yeah.

244
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:58,554
亲爱的  这没什么好羞愧的
Well, honey, please. There's no reason to be ashamed.

245
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:00,308
手淫是很正常的事
Masturbation is perfectly natural.

246
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,350
你这个年纪的男孩都会想试验一下
I mean, boys your age are maybe into experimentation

247
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:07,696
跟动物尝试些新东西
And trying new things with animals.

248
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:11,054
卷毛  我是说她还是小狗的时候  
I mean, Frizzy, she's been in our family for... 

249
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:11,859
就来我们家了
Since she was a puppy...

250
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,988
我要迟到了
Hey, I'm late.

251
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:27,249
-你来迟了  -不好意思
-You're tardy. -Sorry.

252
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,586
你先从清理那些烧过的书开始
You can start by cleaning off all the damaged books

253
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,215
然后把坏的分类出来  我会随时检查 
And separating the ruined ones. I'll be checking on you.

254
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,730
Heidi 听着 关于昨天晚上
Heidi. Look, about last night...

255
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:41,774
我不想谈那个
I don't wanna talk about it.

256
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,517
-我只是想告诉你  -罗伯
-Well, I just wanted to tell you... - Rob.

257
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,655
我去倒脏水
I'm gonna go empty this bucket.

258
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,373
看我找到了什么
Do you have any idea what I found here?

259
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,581
这可是《索爱天书》
This is the Bible. 

260
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,951
我以为这只是个都市传说
I thought that was an urban legend.

261
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,419
不  这是真的  这可以追溯到几十年前
No. This is real. This goes back decades.

262
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,416
那又怎样
Okay. So what?

263
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:52,083
这书可以帮我们把到妹
This is exactly what we need to finally get laid.

264
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:55,337
这东西怎么帮我们呢  它全毁了
How is this thing gonna help us get laid? It's ruined.

265
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:57,674
大部分都看不了
You can't even read most of it.

266
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,044
这书每年都帮了

I'm sorry! I wasn't stealing. It was a...it was a prank.

356

00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:35,800
怎么这么久  搞定了吗
What took you so long? Did you get it?

368
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:38,088
当然 我还帮你偷了个袋子  
Sure did. I even stole you a bag

369
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,890
你回家之前都不用碰到它
So you don't have to touch it till you get home.

370
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,474
很好  谢了
Great. Thanks.

371
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:44,183
嘿  你好啊  艾什莉
Hey. What's up, Ashley?

372
00:27:44,317 --> 00:27:46,227
你们几个同性恋在这个干嘛
What are you pillow biters doing here?

373
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,399
斯蒂夫勒
Stifler.

374
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:50,192
别吃那个  会增肥的
Don't eat that. You're gonna get fat.

375
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:53,448
我超级饥渴  想去夏普专卖店搞我吗
I'm super horny. Wanna suck me off in the Sharper Image?

376
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,775
好啊
Okay.

377
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,710
达娜  打扰了  真抱歉
Dana. Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

378
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:16,552
我不是故意要扰乱...  晨间弥撒的
Didn't mean to disrupt the... This morning's mass.

379
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:19,215
你来做什么
What are you doing here?

380
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,512
我是来道歉的
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

381
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:23,829
你觉得现在适合
Did you really think 

382
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,933
说这个吗
That this is the best time to discuss this?

383
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,734
可是你都不回我短信
Well, you weren't answering any of my texts.

384
00:28:29,863 --> 00:28:31,855
-我出去一下  行吗  -去吧
- I’ll be right back, okay? -  Okay.

385
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:34,071
什么是信念
What is faith?

386
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:36,614
当你按下厨房灯的开关
When you flip the light switch in your kitchen,

387
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:39,111
你知道灯会亮
You know that the light will turn on.

388
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:41,578
有人说这就是信念  
Some might call that faith, 

389
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:44,662
但我说  这不是真正的信念
but I tell you, that is not the real faith.

390
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:47,501
好吧 什么事这么重要
Okay, so what is so important 

391
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:48,877
非得你打断弥撒
That you needed to come and interrupt church?

392
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:50,673
真不明白你现在干嘛这么生我的气
I don't really get why you're so mad at me right now.

393
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,714
因为你不尊重我  
Because you don't respect me. 

394
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,887
对你来说只是个大笑话
This is all just a big joke to you.

395
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:57,154
知道吗  你说得没错  
You know what? You're right, 

396
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,554
这就是你的另一面
Because this is just another face for you.

397
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:00,184
就像你在做年鉴的时候一样
Just like your little stint on yearbook.

398
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:01,742
一开始坚持  然后呢  
You stuck with that for, what, 

399
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:02,724
两周以后就厌倦了
Two weeks before you got bored with it?

400
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:05,268
为什么让你相信我希望等到结婚后
Why is it so hard for you to believe that I wanna

401
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:06,732
再做这件事这么难
Wait until marriage?

402
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:08,015
因为你一个晚上同时和道格・威尔勒
Because you slept with Doug Wheeler.

403
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:10,232
还有斯科特・汤普逊睡过
And Scott Thompson on the same night.

404
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,396
那不算  我喝醉了
That doesn't count: I was drunk.

405
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:13,603
是达娜在说话吗
Is that Dana?

406
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,572
一旦你厌倦这个誓言之后
As soon as you get bored with this whole pledge thing,

407
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:18,409
你就会回到之前的状况了
You're just gonna jump right back in the saddle again.

408
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:20,701
等你到了大学  别告诉我说
And when you get to college, don't even tell me

409
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,443
你没和女同性恋
That you won't be experimenting 

410
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:23,624
尝试过交往
with the standard lesbian hookups,

411
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,997
3P  还有肛交
Having three-ways, trying anal.

412
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:28,243
-耶  -耶
- Yeah. - Yeah.

413
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:29,369
我就说嘛
That's what I'm talking...

414
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:30,709
放松
Just relax.

415
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:31,913
-别愣着啊  -信念是...
- Do something! - Faith is...

416
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:33,419
-她是你女儿  -快去
- She’s your daughter. - Go!

417
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,134
信念坚如磐石...
Faith is the rock-solid...

418
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,741
你不相信我是认真的吗
You don't think I'm committed to this? 

419
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,137
我父母就等到结婚后才做
My parents waited until marriage.

420
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:41,390
我爸和你妈一起上的高中
My dad went to high school with your mom.

421
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:42,970
他说她上过整个橄榄球队
He said she blew the whole football team

422
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,436
搞得不得不去洗胃
And had to have her stomach pumped.

423
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,350
别这么恶心行不
Don't be gross, okay?

424
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:49,143
另外  你爸只是替补
Plus, your dad was a beta.

425
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,942
那些家伙可是性交好手
Those guys are notorious poon slayers.

426
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,937
他妈的  全是胡扯
Fuck it! This is bullshit!

427
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:58,192
你知道你想这么做
You know you want this.

428
00:29:58,994 --> 00:30:00,322
我们错过圣餐了吗
Did we miss communion?

429
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,465
东大瀑布高中的开拓者加油
Go for the East Great Falls Blazers

430
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:06,292
加油  开拓者
Go, Blazers!

431
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:07,588
令人惊讶的是  
Which is surprising, 

432
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:09,710
鉴于这是本季最后一场主场比赛
since this is the last home game of the season.

433
00:30:09,796 --> 00:30:11,789
他们使出了全部的力气
You'd think they'd really pump up the power there.

434
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:13,625
小心  盯住他  盯住他
Look at him! Watch that guy! Watch that guy!

435
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:17,928
尽管现在比分接近平局
Even though it's close to a tie, 

436
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:20,800
哦  天哪  对了  你爸刚才说什么
Oh, my gosh, wait. So, what did your dad say?

437
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:23,216
他说如果再看到内森在我100英尺内出现
He said if he ever sees Nathan within 100 feet of me,

438
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,386
他会用生锈的园艺工具把他阉了
He's gonna castrate him with a rusty garden weasel.

439
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:29,179
不是吧  那你们结束了还是怎样
Oh, no. So what? Is it over between you guys or what?

440
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:30,472
不知道
I don't know.

441
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,312
如果你想整他的话
Well, if you ever want to try a mage, 

442
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:34,150
欢迎加入我和理查德
You're welcome to join Richard and me.

443
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:36,859
-别  -不用了
- No. - No.

444
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,487
别在戴利教练面前说"年轻男孩"
Please don't say "young boy" around Coach Daly.

445
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:41,035
没错  他是...
Yeah, out here he's...

446
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,494
-那你呢  美女  -什么
- What about you, missy? - What?

447
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,038
你的性生活啊
How's your sex life?

448
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:46,743
拜托  我打算开始性生活  是的  没错
You guys, I'm gonna go through with it. I am. I am.

449
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:47,775
真无聊  
You're so boring. 

450
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:50,036
我以为你在图书馆脱衣服后
I would've thought you'd be fielding offers

451
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:52,168
早就已经都搞定了
After your striptease in the library.

452
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,705
是的  我只是在等待好的时机
Yeah, I’m... I'm still just waiting for the right time.

453
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,290
蓝白军  先前冲  加油  必胜  
Blue and white, let's go, fight, win.

Fight, win. Blue and white, let's go, fight, win.

457
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:44,258
我想你拍啦啦队拍得够多了吧
I think that is quite enough pictures of the cheerleaders.

458
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:46,757
应该多拍点比赛吧
How about we get some of the game?

459
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:07,365
继续
As you were.

460
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:13,664
蠢货
Douche bag.

461
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:15,747
蓝白军
Blue and white...

462
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,214
希尔森把球带到了前场
Shearson's bringing the ball up court.

463
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,706
把球传给了斯科特・斯戴福尔
He passes it off to Scott Stifler.

464
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:30,096
中心高中队拦下了希尔森的球
Central takes a charge from Shearson.

465
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:33,271
时间到  开拓者  现在该怎么做呢  比尔
Time out, Blazers. What are we gonna do now, bill?

466
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:34,680
离比赛结束还有10秒
Ten seconds in the game.

467
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:36,399
我想他们该好好努力打下去
I think these guys really need to get their act

468
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:38,334
用心比赛  傻子
Get your head in the game, doggy style.

469
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,185
你可以比赛完了再做你的春梦
You can finish your wet dream later.

470
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,071
-对不起  -比赛情况就是这样
- I'm sorry. - This is it for this game.

471
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:44,149
嗨  斯科特  我能和你说两句吗
Hey, Scott? Can I talk to you for a sec?

472
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:45,752
你疯了吗  我还在比赛
Are you nuts? I'm in the middle of a game.

473
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:46,912
本赛季的最后一场主场比赛
Last home game of the season.

474
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:49,325
真的让他们好好行动起来
Really gotta get their act together.

475
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,621
89平  还剩3.9秒  
Tie game, 89 all, 3:9 seconds left. 

476
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,079
看看会发生什么
Let's see what's gonna happen here.

477

479
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,414
看起来...  双掩护
Looks like... Double screen!

480
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:04,713
希尔森得球了  太好了  进了
Shearson gets the ball. It's good! It's in!

481
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:09,596
比赛结束  91比89  东大瀑布的开拓者获胜
The game's over. 91-89 for East Great Falls Blazers.

482
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:11,500
不可思议  朋友们
This is incredible, folks! 

483
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:13,468
这意味着我们打入季后赛了

今天发生的这些太美妙了
What a chain of events that has occurred here today!

486
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:28,157
亲爱的  我们得谈谈
Honey, I need to talk to you.

487
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:30,329
哦  好的
Yeah, sure.

488
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:33,289
那个...是圣经吗
Is...is that a bible?

489
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,917
什么  不是  这是...
What? No. No, it's...

490
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,800
亲爱的  读圣经没什么不好啊  
Well, honey, it's okay to read the bible. 

491
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,038
我的意思是  你表现得
I mean, gosh, you act like

492
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:39,161
像我抓到你读色情书
I caught you reading pornography.

493
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:42,919
你刚要说什么来着
What did you wanna talk about?

494
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:45,796
我刚收到我的信用卡账单
Well, I just got my credit card statement and...

495
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,613
你的刷卡记录里
And here on your card 

496
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:49,339
有项来自内衣店
There's a charge here for a lingerie store.

497
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:52,853
是的...我会把钱还你的  老妈
Yeah, I’m... I'm gonna pay you back for that, mom.

498
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:56,354
你谈恋爱了吗
Is there a girl you're seeing?

499
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:59,643
不是  老妈  这很复杂
No. Mom, it's complicated.

500
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:03,530
-你是买给自己的吗  -不是
- did you buy something for yourself? - no!

501
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:05,357
你对这方面好奇很正常
Because it's a very normal area of exploration.

502
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:06,089
书上说
My book says that 

503
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,864
某些恋物癖不代表就是同性恋
Most fetishes are not homosexual in nature,

504
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:10,779
而且  你知道的  男孩子么...
And, well, you know, boys, they tend to...

505
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:13,014
好了老妈  没错  你说的对  
Yes, mom, that's it. You figured it out. 

506
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:14,489
我就是喜欢穿女性的内衣
I love wearing women's underwear.

507
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,204
小内裤  丁字裤  还有连衫衬裤
Thongs, g-strings, a little teddy now and then.

508
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:19,832
穿起来又软又滑  有花边的更好
It's so soft and silky smooth. The frillier the better.

509
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:20,952
淫荡啊
Sexy.

510
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:23,254
天哪  拜托
Oh, god! Come on.

511
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:24,373
搞定
Gotcha.

512
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:31,013
所以是给女生的咯
So it was for a girl.

513
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:33,720
是的  老妈
Yeah, mom.

514
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:35,473
很好
Great.

515
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:53,036
你还记得在舞会前你和我说的话吗
So, you know that thing you told me before the dance?

516
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,200
记得
Yeah.

517
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,745
好吧  我在想你说的那些话
Right, well, I was thinking about that conversation.

518
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,577
怎么了
So, what about it?

519
00:34:58,793 --> 00:35:02,838
我在想  我觉得  你或许该等等
I was just thinking, you know, maybe you should wait.

520
00:35:03,798 --> 00:35:07,582
我知道  我也一直在想这事儿
I know. You know, I’ve thought about it, too,

521
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:10,251
但我一直觉得这整件事
But I still feel like I'm making this whole thing

522
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,351
好像  变成了一个大问题  
Into, like, this huge deal. 

523
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:14,510
我的意思是  它一直困扰着我
I mean, it's consuming my every thought.

524
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,931
我不知道该怎么做  罗伯
I don't know, Rob.

525
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:23,439
我总觉得搞定这件事是最好的
I still feel like it's best if I just get it over with.

526
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:26,523
没错  我懂
Yeah. I can see that.

527
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:32,400
你说的对  我就是喜欢穿女性的内衣
You figured it out. I love wearing women's underwear.

528
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:34,819
小内裤  丁字裤  还有连衫衬裤
Thongs, g-strings, a little teddy now and then.

529
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:37,665
穿起来又软又滑  有花边的更好
It's so soft and silky smooth. The frillier the better.

530
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,955
这是什么东西  蠢货
What is up with this crap, butt nugget?

531
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:42,131
这完全是断章取义
That was taken completely out of context.

532
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,957
我当时说的是玩笑话
All right? I was being facetious.

533
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:46,959
他的意思是他不是当真的
That means he wasn't being serious.

534
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:51,089
我知道玩笑是什么意思  蠢货
I know what facetious means, dick face.

535
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:53,838
你是想全校的女生都讨厌你吗
Are you trying to repel all the pussy in school?

536
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,474
-不是  -滴答滴答  和狗搞的人

537
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,969

540
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,569
今天的关键词是腿
The word for the day is legs

541
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,522
所以呢
So?

542
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,248
为何不去我那
So, why don't we go back to my place 

543
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,152
探讨一下这个词
And spread the word?

544
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,653
为什么你不省口气
Well, how about you save your breath?

545
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,205
还是留着对你的马子说吧
You're gonna need it to inflate your date later.

546
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:29,342
绅士们  是找个妞上床的时候了
Gentlemen, it is time we got laid.

547
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,875

Really? And what is it we've been trying to do all this time?

548
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,188
不不  我们得做爱  
No, no. We need to get laid.

549
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:37,011
这写着  1995年9月9号
Right here. September 9th, 1995.

550
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:40,515
你能不能说个简洁扼要的纲领
Can you give us the executive summary?

551
00:36:40,604 --> 00:36:44,553
不  不是那个  看这
No, not that. This.

552
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:49,522
我们得来次公路旅行
We are going on a road trip.

553
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:10,250
你们打算在加拿大呆多长时间

就几个小时
Just a couple of hours.

555
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:15,715
你们来这干什么
What's the nature of your visit?

556
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:19,388
我们驱车好几百英里来这找辣妹
We've driven many miles in search of vertical smiles.

557
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,679
这用的是公里
We use kilometres here.

558
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:31,397
那我们驱车几百公里来这润滑一下老二
Then we've driven many clicks to wet our dicks?

559
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:33,103
是这样

操你们美国佬
Fucking Americans.

562
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:43,398
加拿大的外汇率
You know, the exchange rate 

563
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,871
真的能帮我们解决不少问题
On the dollar is really gonna help us out.

564
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,991

性经上说我们得找莫妮克
The bible says to ask for Monique.

571
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,703
嗨  你是莫妮克吗

看来我们是来对地方了
We came to the right place.

582

那是头麋鹿吗
Is that a moose?

583
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:11,535
要套套吗

你能给我们一分钟时间吗
Could you just give us just one minute?

595
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:36,067
也许能够让我们学到不少知识 
This could be very educational for all of us. 

596

热烈欢迎
And welcome.

605
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:26,376
那...应该怎么做
So...so, how does this work? 

606
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:27,472
我该付你钱吗
Am I supposed to pay you?

607
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,392
不不不  现在不需要
No, no, no. Not yet.

608
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:38,569
我明白了
I see.

609
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:37,084
你是在做白日梦呢  年轻人
You've got one active imagination, boy.

610
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,639

这次只有八秒钟

623
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,130
怎么了  你难道还想要个观众吗
What, do you need an audience?

624
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:09,446
不  不  等等  伙计  
No, no. Wait, guys. 

625
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:09,969
我猜她是死了

626
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:11,641
你说什么
Excuse me?

Forget it. It's totally screwed up.Oh, god.

644
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:00,526

What you do to maman?

645
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:11,910
妈妈  你们杀了妈妈

651
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,722
伙计  
Hey, man

00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,335
阎王要你二更死  不会留你到五更
When it's your time to go, it's your time to go.

653
00:45:43,335 --> 00:45:44,195
她人生已经很完整了
She led a full life.

654
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,311
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

You're the one that murdered her!

657
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:48,995
真不敢相信
I can't believe that was the woman 

658
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,325
她就是性经上说的做爱对象

Guys, I think it's time we try my interpretation.

670
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,379
听着  内森
Look, Nathan

671
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,939
你想说服达娜和你上床
You've been trying to convince Dana to sleep with you

672
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:29,190
而不是对她言听计从是吧
Instead of just listening to her. Right, you know?

673
00:46:29,283 --> 00:46:31,520
为何不从她的角度考虑一下  
Trying to see things from her point of view? 

674
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:32,320
给她...
Showing just...

675
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:34,404
...一点点的尊重
Just a little respect.

676
00:46:34,497 --> 00:46:35,354
还有你  
And you, you're still 

677
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:37,414
你还在引诱女孩子和你上床
Trying to trick women into sleeping with you

678
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,540
而不是坦诚相待
Instead of just being honest.

679
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:41,349
你还不是个不敢告诉
And you're still too much of a pussy 

680
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,378
海蒂自己喜欢她的孬种
To tell Heidi you're into her.

681
00:46:47,278 --> 00:46:49,178
(图书馆入口)

682
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,763
你今晚会去斯戴福尔那吗
You going to Stifler's house tonight?

683
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:57,223
是的  我有可能和达娜一块
Yeah. I'll probably go with Dana.

684
00:46:57,353 --> 00:47:00,888
那个你想赶快解决的事有什么进展吗
So any luck losing that thing you were trying to get rid of?

685
00:47:00,982 --> 00:47:03,389
-罗伯  -我只是随便问问
- Rob. - I'm just asking.

686
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:05,607
也许你该少管闲事
Maybe you should mind your own business.

687
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:11,240
你今天怎么了
What's with you today?

688
00:47:21,127 --> 00:47:22,507
我想跟你说件
I wanna tell you something that 

689
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:25,041
很早之前就想告诉你的事
I've been wanting to say for a long time.

690
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:26,210
好的
Okay.

691
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:33,089
我很喜欢你
I really like you.

692
00:47:33,723 --> 00:47:35,762
我也很喜欢你
I really like you, too.

693
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:41,600
不  不是那样的  我是真的很喜欢你
No, not like that. I really like you.

694
00:47:47,153 --> 00:47:48,433
-罗伯  -我觉得你很棒
- Rob... - I think you're great.

695
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:52,067
你性格好  很会说笑话  
You have a great personality. I laugh at all your jokes. 

696
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:53,567
还有你很漂亮
You're pretty.

697
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:58,368
天啊  你很漂亮  闻起来都这么香
Oh, god, you're pretty. You even smell great.

698
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:01,665
我不知道  只是...
I don't know. I'm just... 

699
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,249
和你在一起很快乐
I'm happy when I'm around you.

700
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:04,527
我不知道你是否有这样的感觉  
Now, I don't know if you feel the same way 

701
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:05,163
如果有的话...
but if you do...

702
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:06,467
那我们就不要再浪费时间了  
Let's not waste any more time. 

703
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:07,247
好吗  我们...
Right? let's just

704
00:48:08,341 --> 00:48:10,713
试着跟着感觉走
See where our feelings take us.

705
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:16,215
我也有同样的感觉
I feel the same way.

706
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:19,468
-真的吗  -是的
- You do? - Yes.

707
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,764
这太棒了  你为什么不说呢
This is great. Why didn't you say something?

708
00:48:22,855 --> 00:48:24,349
你为什么不说
Why didn't you?

709
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:32,663
时间到了  我得走了  晚上见
It's about that time, so I gotta go. but I'll see you tonight?

710
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:35,404
好的
Yes.

711
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:56,258
爸爸
Dad?

712
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,473
她过来了
There she is.

713
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:09,103
他们看到我了  快蹲下  蹲下
They saw me! Get down! Get down!

714
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,366
哦  上帝啊  上帝啊  
Oh, my god. Oh, my gosh. 

715
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,753
快开车
Drive. drive.

716
00:49:16,014 --> 00:49:16,699
没什么  没什么
It's cool. It's cool.

717
00:49:17,827 --> 00:49:20,863
内森  听着  我在想
Nathan, look, I've been thinking.

718
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:23,747
或许我对你太苛刻了
Maybe I've been too hard on you.

719
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:25,864
有吗
You have?

720
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:28,468
看得出你喜欢我女儿  
You obviously love my daughter, 

721
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:29,959
你们应该在一起
And you two should be together.

722
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:33,503
-我们应该吗  -当然
- We should? - Absolutely.

723
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:37,835
亲爱的  这样招待人家可不对
Honey, it is not right to give a man blue balls.

724
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,964
如果你想男孩子喜欢自己  
If you want boys to like you

725
00:49:39,965 --> 00:49:40,746
就得秀出来
you gotta put out.

726
00:49:40,746 --> 00:49:42,842
先从内森的朋友入手
Here, start with nathan's friend.

727
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:56,239
这真是逊毙了
This is so not cool.

728
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:58,897
意淫你死党的女朋友吗
I mean, fantasising about your best friend's girlfriend?

729
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:02,154
哦  上帝啊
Oh, my god!

730
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:05,407
-爸爸  不要  -操你他妈的混蛋
- Dad! Stop! Stop. - Fucknut!

731
00:50:31,526 --> 00:50:33,435
好的  女孩们
All right, girls.

732
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:35,687
-派对看起来不错  -是的
- Party looks good. - Yeah.

733
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:40,028
听我说  集中精神
All right, listen to me. Stay focused.

734
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:42,047
坦白点  尊重对方  
Be honest, show respect 

735
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:43,451
说出自己心声
And just say whatever's on your mind.

736
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:44,569
闭嘴  混球
Stop, jerk.

737
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:45,743
甚至都不能接近达娜
I can't even get near Dana.

738
00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:47,242
她很快就到  和海蒂一起
She'll be here. She's coming with Heidi.

739
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,871
尽量设身处地为她着想
Just try and think of things from her point of view.

740
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:51,313
这点如果我在行的话  
Yeah, and I might as well just crack the da vinci code 

741
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,665
达芬奇密码早被我解出来了
While I'm at it.

742
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:54,795
给她送点乳香精油和没药
Just get her some frankincense and myrrh.

743
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:55,914
好主意
That's a great idea.

744
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:58,297
如果不奏效的话我会给你好果子吃
I'll just pick up some roofies for you while I'm out.

745
00:50:58,386 --> 00:51:01,636
据我所知  那得有配方才行
You need a prescription for that, from what I hear.

746
00:51:01,722 --> 00:51:03,632
卢贝  听仔细  这对你也有用
Lube, pay attention. This applies to you, too.

747
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:07,674
我们进去后  尽量保持自我
All right. Let's try to go in there and just be real.

748
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:10,306
好的  奥普拉
All right, Oprah.

749
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:38,823
嘿  那不是从中心高中来的妞吗
Hey. Isn't that that chick from Central?

750
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,654
没错
Yeah.

751
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,500
嘿  斯戴福尔
Hey, Stifler.

752
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,454
嘿  你叫
Oh, hey, there...

753
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:47,160
是凯蒂
Katie.

754
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,859
对  是凯蒂  我当然知道  
Katie, right. I knew that. 

755
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,962
只是和你开个玩笑
Just having some fun with you.

756
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,001
我能和你谈谈吗  就我俩的谈话
Can I talk to you for a second, like, in private?

757
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,794
可以  你知道吗
Yeah, sure, you know what?

758
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:59,890
我再去拿杯酒  随后就来找你
Let me just grab another beer and I'll be right back with you.

759
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:01,802
不要放我鸽子
Don't you flake on me.

760
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:06,981
-伙计看来收获不错  -我不这么认为
- Dude, you been working out? - Didn't think so.

761
00:52:07,108 --> 00:52:10,524
-你们两个真能扛  -上帝
- You two, stay amazing. - My god.

762
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:15,572
嘿  怎么样  美人儿
Hey, what's up, beautiful?

763
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:17,567
我上周末烂醉如泥
You know, I got so drunk last weekend

764
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,356
结果把自己的小弟弟钉在桌上  
That I nailed my cock to a table 

765
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:21,076
放在火上烤
then set it on fire.

766
00:52:21,497 --> 00:52:22,991
想检查一下吗
Wanna check it out?

767
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:24,956
检查桌子还是你的老二
The table or your cock?

768
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:27,160
天啊  我爱死那个腔调了
God, I love that accent.

769
00:52:27,253 --> 00:52:29,080
你能够帮我个忙  说一下...
Could you do me a favour and just say,

770
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:30,541
"打我的屁股  斯戴福尔"
"spank me, Stifler. "

771
00:52:31,557 --> 00:52:33,351
"打我的小屁股"
"Spank me wee little bum."

772
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:36,923
你怎么知道我喜欢被人打屁股
How did you know I like to be spanked?

773
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:40,047
太棒了
Awesome!

774
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:42,978
那个你一直叨叨念念的
So where's this boyfriend Richard you 

775
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:45,015
男友理查德哪去了
Keep talking about non-stop all the time?

776
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:47,642
他不参加高中派对
He doesn't attend high-school parties.

777
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,003
听起来你是想要些
Sounds like you might be 

778
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:52,275
国产的美国牛肉啊
In the market for some home-grown American beef.

779
00:52:52,361 --> 00:52:53,986
对不起  我是素食主义者
Sorry, I'm vegan.

780
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,270
干杯
Cheers.

781
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:01,326
那用黄瓜行吗
What if I use a cucumber?

782
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:06,294
伙计们  就在今晚  
All right, boys. Tonight's the night. 

783
00:53:06,295 --> 00:53:07,180
快祝我好运
Wish me luck.

784
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:08,463
祝你好运  伙计
Good luck, buddy.

785
00:53:08,557 --> 00:53:09,540
祝你好运  伙计  
Good luck, dude. 

786
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:11,013
今晚  你将成为真正的男人
Tonight, you become a man.

787
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:13,308
说得对  今晚  我要做爱
That's it. Tonight, I'm getting laid!

788
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,644
-是的  伙计  -是的  伙计
- Yeah, buddy! Yes! - Yeah, buddy.

789
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:17,142
-是的  -就在这
- Yes! - Right here.

790
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:19,190
开始的时候慢点温柔点
Just give it to her nice and slow at first.

791
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:20,984
然后加快节奏
Then speed her up.

792
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,435
达娜
Dana!

793
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:24,817
达娜
Dana!

794
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:38,322
我找遍了  没见到海蒂
I can't find Heidi anywhere. 

795
00:53:38,323 --> 00:53:39,316
或许她根本就没来
Maybe she didn't come.

796
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,530
不  不 她的车就停在外面 
No, no. Her car is outside.

797
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:43,781
你认为是怎么回事
How you making out?

798
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:45,364
看那边
Check it out.

799
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,062
你难道不觉得或许
Don't you think maybe 

800
00:53:48,063 --> 00:53:50,622
艾什莉对你来说太有难度吗
Ashley's just a little bit out of your league?

801
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,110
我不知道  我只是想说  
I don't know. I'm just saying, you know

802
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:54,956
你已经盯上她好几年了
You've been at it for years.

803
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,419
或许你和她之间没有可能
Maybe it's just not in the cards for you.

804
00:53:57,508 --> 00:53:58,967
我是个有修养的人
I'm a man of refinement.

805
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:02,301
能得十分为什么要去得六分呢
Why settle for a six when you can get a perfect 10?

806
00:54:05,307 --> 00:54:08,511
好吧  随便你怎么说  祝你好运了
Okay, whatever you say, man. Good luck.

807
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:11,135

You obviously know that I'm, like, totally into you. Right?

815
00:54:30,124 --> 00:54:31,702
是啊  我去求过签的
Yeah. I've seen the Shrine.

816
00:54:34,128 --> 00:54:35,752

I'm just gonna lay it out on the line.

819
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:43,000
并且毫无保留的
No tricks, no hidden agenda at all.

820
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,550
我碰巧是个敏感专业的情人
I happen to be a sensitive and expert lover.

821

我保证让你爽到极限
I can guarantee that I will satisfy you in every way possible,

822
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,356
在你飘飘欲仙之前
And I shall not stop until I'm certain

823
00:54:58,444 --> 00:55:01,729
我绝不会停止
That you are completely happy with my endeavours.

824
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:07,149

825
00:55:15,419 --> 00:55:20,662

828
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:27,589
但我们之间是不可能的
But it's not gonna happen.

829
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:31,181
我是说  我知道你超酷
I mean, I think that you're, like, really super cool,

830
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:33,060
班里班外看起来也都很可爱
And you're really funny in class and everything,

831
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:35,897
但我不想跟你做爱
But I don't wanna have sex with you.

832
00:55:36,774 --> 00:55:37,853
明白吗
Okay?

833
00:55:38,317 --> 00:55:40,191
当然  当然  好的

835
00:55:44,365 --> 00:55:45,563
好的
All right.

836
00:55:45,658 --> 00:55:47,235
我要再去拿杯啤酒  你还要吗
Well, I'm gonna go get another beer. Do you want one?

837
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:49,995
不  不  不用了  谢谢
No, no. I'm...I'm good. I'm good.

838
00:55:56,877 --> 00:55:59,878
你刚才说什么
What you said just now?

839
00:56:00,172 --> 00:56:01,287
怎么了
Yeah?

840
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,966
是真的吗
Was that true?

841
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:06,097
保证满意而且绝不
Guaranteed satisfaction and you won't 

842
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:09,055
停止除非女生爽歪之后
Stop until a girl is completely satisfied?

843
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:11,303
当然
Yeah.

844
00:56:12,977 --> 00:56:15,646
那好吧  管它呢
All right. Well, what the hell.

845
00:56:16,355 --> 00:56:19,558
到楼上左边第一间卧室找我
Meet me upstairs in the first bedroom to the left.

846
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:30,931
我要和艾米做爱了

847
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:35,617
事实上  我一直都对你施压
The truth is, yes, I was trying to pressure you,

848
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:38,460
因为我太想  太想做爱了
Because I really, really wanna have sex.

849
00:56:38,586 --> 00:56:42,630
但我只想跟你做爱
But I really wanna have sex with you.

850
00:56:43,591 --> 00:56:44,956
而且一直以来
And, also, I mean, with us,

851
00:56:44,957 --> 00:56:47,458
约会也总以我为中心
hooking up has always been about me.

852
00:56:49,597 --> 00:56:51,761
我想改变一下  
I wanna forget myself for once 

853
00:56:51,762 --> 00:56:53,926
来好好满足一下你
And try to make you feel good for a change.

854
00:56:54,018 --> 00:56:57,876
就像  让你满足我那样
Like, maybe try and make you feel the way that

855
00:56:57,877 --> 00:56:58,929
满足你
You make me feel.

856
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:26,838
别看  别看  那是我的手机
You shouldn't...You shouldn't... It's my phone.

857
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:28,387
别看我的手机
Don't read my phone.

858
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:32,932
这是什么意思  "给她一剂炭疽病毒"
What's this supposed to mean? "Give her a dose of manthrax"?

859
00:57:33,143 --> 00:57:34,174
我不知道  我也不知道什么意思
Well, I don't...what does that...

860
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:36,095
我也不知道  你知道吗
I don't know what that... Do you know what that means?

861
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:38,096
"我要上床了"
"I'm getting laid"?

862
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:41,599
还没发生你就到处宣扬
You're advertising this before it even happens?

863
00:57:41,693 --> 00:57:42,772
-不  -哇
- No. - Wow.

864
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:45,233
你还真是个怪异的变态
You must be some special kind of asshole.

865
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:47,610
不  不  不  不  我没有  那是
No. no, no, no! no. I didn't...It was...

866
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:50,284
等着吧  你个败寇
Later, loser.

867
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:59,376
再快点  好的  现在  慢点 就这样
Faster. Okay. Now, slower. Yes, Yes.

00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:02,462
再慢点  舔外阴  对  就这样
Slower. Tickle the bunny. Yes, Yes.

869
00:58:02,547 --> 00:58:05,085
天呢  开始高潮了
Oh, God, the man in the boat is out.

870
00:58:05,175 --> 00:58:07,500
继续  继续  口交舌功  打卷
Paddle, paddle, do the Alphabet. Swirl.

871
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:11,212
回到外阴那  太爽了  往左边移
Back to the bunny. That's it. Okay. Now, more to the left.

872
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:13,299
再往左点
More to the left!

873
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,266
-我左边还是你左边  -我左边  
- My left or your left? - My left, my left, my left!

874
00:58:15,351 --> 00:58:16,383
好的
All right.

875
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:20,138
嗨  看见海蒂了吗
Hey, have you seen Heidi?

876
00:58:20,899 --> 00:58:22,097
谢谢
Thanks.

877
00:58:23,693 --> 00:58:24,974
嗨  罗伯

00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:27,978
海蒂
Heidi?

879
00:58:29,032 --> 00:58:32,448
狗仔  告诉过你  打个盹你就输了
Hey, doggy style. I told you, you snooze, you lose.

880
00:58:32,535 --> 00:58:35,987
若不想看我们做爱  就走人  变态
So unless you want mop-up duty, close the door, pervert.

881
00:58:46,674 --> 00:58:47,837
你去哪
Hey, where are you going?

882
00:58:47,926 --> 00:58:50,132
这个主意太差劲了
This was a horrible idea.

883
00:58:57,435 --> 00:58:59,309
罗伯  借过一下
Rob? Excuse me.

884
00:59:00,563 --> 00:59:04,312
借过一下  罗伯  罗伯
Excuse me. Rob. Rob.

885
00:59:05,235 --> 00:59:06,978
-走开  -我不想

886
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,643
我现在不想看见你
I don't wanna see your face right now.

887
00:59:10,532 --> 00:59:11,646
罗伯
Rob.

888
00:59:26,923 --> 00:59:28,002
你在干什么
What are you doing?

889
00:59:28,091 --> 00:59:29,331
你不是说不管自己  
What happened to forgetting about yourself 

890
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:32,171
就让我爽吗
And making me feel good?

891
00:59:32,971 --> 00:59:34,679
但是我想
But I thought I just...

892
00:59:34,764 --> 00:59:36,258
什么  你想什么  内森 
What? You thought that what, Nathan?

893
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:38,201
你就假装关心我的想法
That you could just pretend that you cared about

894
00:59:38,202 --> 00:59:39,683
在意我的誓言
My feelings and my pledge

895
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:42,687
然后再趁机占我便宜吗
And then just go and try again when my guard was down?

896
00:59:42,772 --> 00:59:45,061
不  你没明白  我
No. You don't get it. I...

897
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:48,186
不  不  是你没搞明白
No. no, you're the one that's not gonna get it.

898
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:01,576
兄弟  你要悠着点
Dude, you need to slow down.

899
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:03,955
是啊  真的  我们还是回去吧
Yeah, seriously. Let's just go home.

900
01:00:04,043 --> 01:00:07,543
对  对  关于《索爱天书》  你说的对
You, Sir... you, Sir, were right about the Bible.

901
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:11,127
因为贱人喜欢做爱
Because assholes get laid!

902
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:13,416
对
Yes.

903
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,884
不  不  不  兄弟  你才是对的
No. no, no, dude. You were right.

904
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:21,384
-里面蕴意深刻  -你在说什么
- There's something to it. - What are you talking about?

905
01:00:21,478 --> 01:00:23,060
我们试着做好男
We tried the nice guy thing

906
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:25,096
还保留着处男身
and I believe we're all still virgins.

907
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,559
而这种好男情怀让我越界了
Well, the nice guy vibe got me past the bouncer, man.

908
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:37,633
绅士们  你们都输了  
Well, gentlemen, you failed, 

909
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,860
因为你们都嫉妒
And the proof, as they say, is in the jell-o.

910
01:00:41,873 --> 01:00:44,364
兄弟们  一会见
So I will see you later, nice guys.

911
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:51,876
我知道你对我感兴趣
I know you want me.

912
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:55,252
我跟你上楼  让你爽死
I'm gonna let you take me upstairs and do me right now.

913
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,262

- Really? - Yeah.

914
01:00:57,972 --> 01:00:59,217
吻我
Kiss me.

915
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:12,025
嗨  女士们
Hey, ladies.

916
01:01:21,162 --> 01:01:22,573

Oh, my god.

917
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:24,742
哦  天啊
Oh, my god!

918
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,076

从后面干我
Do me from behind.

920
01:01:38,012 --> 01:01:39,127

What?

921
01:01:40,765 --> 01:01:43,256
我以为你喜欢后进式
I thought you liked it doggy style.

922
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:52,312
你在那干什么呢  进来啊
What are you doing back there? let's go.

923
01:01:53,653 --> 01:01:56,654
你不会把你的弟弟插进去是吧
You're not putting your dick in that, are you?

924
01:01:58,992 --> 01:02:01,565
你搞啥  太恶心了
Are you kidding me? Gross.

925
01:02:23,475 --> 01:02:25,218
给你  喝点这个有好处
Here. This'll help.

926

929
01:02:31,149 --> 01:02:34,316
但你一定要注意安全
But I can insist that you are safe.

930
01:02:34,777 --> 01:02:36,485
你有没有酒后驾车
Did you drink and drive?

931
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:39,062
没有  约翰・卡斯特罗开车送我回来的
No. John Costello drove me home.

932
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:40,954
我只是想告诉你
I want you to know that

933
01:02:40,954 --> 01:02:44,859
即便欲火焚身
if you find yourself in any carnal situation,

934
01:02:44,954 --> 01:02:47,492
也要注意安全措施
That you...You will use protection.

935
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:49,992
你说欲火指什么啊

现在还有隐私没有
Is there no such thing as privacy any more?

939

我会告诉你父亲
I will tell your father that

940
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,596
说你今天不能见他

How do you know about that?

946
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:24,282
那你认为是谁把这些视频给妈妈看
Who do you think is forwarding all those videos to mom?

947
01:03:29,165 --> 01:03:30,957
我要放弃了
I'm ready to give up.

948
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:32,662
我认为我知道问题答案了
I thought I had the answers.

949
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:36,453
《索爱天书》99%都不能读
It's too bad that 99% of the Bible's completely unreadable.

950
01:03:38,383 --> 01:03:39,711
这样好了
That's it.

951
01:03:40,426 --> 01:03:42,549
我们来重编《索爱天书》
We need to reconstruct the Bible.

952
01:03:42,637 --> 01:03:43,716
为什么
Why?

953
01:03:43,805 --> 01:03:45,216
因为秘密都在这
The secrets are in there.

954
01:03:45,306 --> 01:03:48,224
想要上床不是一下两下能搞定的
I mean, there's no one single answer to getting laid.

955
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:50,267
对吧  我们需要通读才行
Right? We need the whole book to understand.

956
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:52,429
说不定还有好多我们需要知道的呢
Probably has a lot of crap in there that we need to know, too,

957
01:03:52,522 --> 01:03:55,523
比如位置  技巧  插入角度
Like positions, techniques, angle of insertion.

958
01:03:55,608 --> 01:03:57,714
没错  《索爱天书》就是
Exactly. That's what the Bible was created for,

959
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:59,820
给我们这种人看的
To help guys like us.

960
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:03,107
我们亏欠别人  是我毁了这本书
And we owe it to the others. I ruined the bible.

961
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:05,987
为了未来的人  我也要恢复这本书的精华
I owe it to future generations to restore its wisdom.

962
01:04:06,077 --> 01:04:08,829
哥们  我也想这么做  但怎么做
Dude, I'm all for it, but how?

963
01:04:14,836 --> 01:04:16,496
从谁开始
Where do we start?

964
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:20,256
从最早开始
From the beginning.

965
01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:22,508
肯定是这个人创了《索爱天书》
This must be the guy who created the Bible.

966
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:24,775
诺亚・莱文斯坦

967
01:04:27,682 --> 01:04:28,880
哪位
Hello?

968
01:04:28,975 --> 01:04:31,762
您好  请问诺亚・莱文斯坦在吗
Hi, may I speak to Noah Levenstein, please?

969
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:32,884
请讲
Speaking.

970
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:35,304
是你创了《圣经》吗
Are you the one who created the Bible?

971
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:39,057
不  应该是上帝
No, that would be God.

972
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:41,062
等等
Hold on.

973
01:04:41,362 --> 01:04:44,696
我指的是《索爱天书》
I'm referring to the Bible.

974
01:04:45,617 --> 01:04:47,360
我是从东大瀑布高中打来的
I'm calling from east great falls high school.

975
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,625
那是1969年高三夏天
It was the summer of my junior year, 1969,

976
01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:57,461
我跟朋友一块去阿姆斯特丹玩
And my buddies and I, we take this trip to Amsterdam,

977
01:04:57,545 --> 01:05:01,460
碰上一群还不错的荷兰淫女
Where we run into a group of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos

978
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:02,831
愿意卖身换一把
Who were willing to trade their bodies for

979
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,761
吉米・亨德里克斯LPS系列电吉他
a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPS.

980
01:05:05,845 --> 01:05:06,701
毋庸置疑
Well, needless to say,

981
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:10,341
那个周末我们和那群小妞玩的超爽
we had ourselves one super weekend with those gals,

982
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:13,263
我指性趣上  如果你理解我说的
Sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

983
01:05:14,062 --> 01:05:16,932
但不幸的是  我们都懵懂无知
But the sad news was, we had no idea what we were doing.

984
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:18,766
什么技巧也不会
We had no technique.

985
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,902
但有一天  我们外出观光时
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

986
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,940
我们在红灯区碰上一个荷兰妓女
And we run into this dutch hooker in the red-light district,

987
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:27,439
她跟我们提起有这么一本书
And she tells us about this book.

988
01:05:28,618 --> 01:05:30,130
一本性爱指南
It was a sex manual,

989
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:33,659
是由19世纪某个牧师写的
evidently written in the 19th century by some priest.

990
01:05:33,748 --> 01:05:36,120
我们详读了一遍又一遍
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

991
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:38,665
然后回到东大瀑布高中
And then when we got back to east great falls,

992
01:05:38,753 --> 01:05:41,505
我有了写一本自己的书的想法
I had the bright idea to write my own book

993
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:45,634
写上自己的观察  经验和建议
And add my own observations and experiences and advice

994
01:05:45,718 --> 01:05:47,480
然后把它留在图书馆
And leave it in the library for some 

995
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,633
给那些不幸处男后辈们
Other hapless virgin in the class below us.

996
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:53,803
但我没想到居然流传了40年
But I had no idea it had been passed down for 40 years.

997
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:56,640
您的书简直是个传奇  莱文斯坦先生
Your book is a legend, Mr. Levenstein.

998
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:00,643
你们带了吗
Do you have it here?

999
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:01,813
带了
Yeah.

1000
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:03,561
我能看一下吗
May I see it?

1001
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:10,148
哦  天啊
Oh, my.

1002
01:06:11,703 --> 01:06:12,782
孩子们
Boys.

1003
01:06:14,456 --> 01:06:17,243
这可真有点历史了
This is a real piece of history here.

1004
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:19,750
它怎么了
What happened to it?

1005
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:21,663
这就是我们来的原因了
Well, that's why we're here.

1006
01:06:21,754 --> 01:06:22,999
《索爱天书》有点被毁了
The Bible kinda got ruined,

1007
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:27,039
所以我们想咨询相关作者来进行重编
So we wanna call everyone on the list and try to reconstruct it.

1008
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:34,428
那看来你们是需要帮助了
Well, I think you boys might need some help.

1009
01:06:36,436 --> 01:06:38,083
女孩们通常有优势
Well, girls have the advantage,

1010
01:06:38,084 --> 01:06:40,350
因为她们会彼此聊天
because girls talk to each other,

1011
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,145
不是跟你们开玩笑  她们连阴茎都聊
And don't kid yourself, they talk about the penis.

1012
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:46,650
阴茎大小  形状  弯曲角度
Penis size, penis shape, the angle of the bend.

1013
01:06:46,988 --> 01:06:48,696
不管你注意没注意的  她们都聊
Whether it winks at you. they talk.

1014
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:50,521
真要想跟女人做爱
Now, to really make love to a woman,

1015
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,696
首先要真正关心她
You gotta really care about her.

1016
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:53,715
做爱很爽
But...hey, sex is great,

1017
01:06:53,716 --> 01:06:56,735
但跟你爱的人做爱才最爽
But sex with someone you love? That's awesome.

1018
01:06:56,831 --> 01:06:58,575
哥们  这太有意义了
Dude, that is so profound.

1019
01:06:58,666 --> 01:06:59,829
我说嘛
Telling you.

1020
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:01,791
是啊  在路上难免会感觉孤单
Yeah, definitely gets lonely on the road.

1021
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:04,416
当然  我用个各种食物自慰
Sure, I made love to all kinds of different food groups.

1022
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:06,712
你试过用花生酱三明治做爱吗
Did you ever try making love to a peanut-butter sandwich?

1023
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,080
超爽
Nothing comes close.

1024
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:09,255
什么
What?

1025
01:07:09,344 --> 01:07:10,994
也可用去骨蹄膀
Well, maybe a deboned ham hock,

1026
01:07:10,995 --> 01:07:13,591
不过准备起来太麻烦
But that takes a whole lot of prep.

1027
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:15,261
屈膝
Bend your knees.

1028
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,137
下次做时  试试印度式
Next time you spank it, sit Indian-Style.

1029
01:07:18,353 --> 01:07:20,096
即使是一百万年都不会泄
You won't come, not in a million years.

1030
01:07:20,188 --> 01:07:22,893
我们的性器官就像音乐器材
Our sex organs are like musical instruments.

1031
01:07:22,982 --> 01:07:24,892
你可以请任何技术员来帮你吹喇叭
Sure, you can have any technician blow on your horn,

1032
01:07:24,984 --> 01:07:28,069
但把乐器放入一位真正的专家手中呢
But to place your instrument into the hands of a true expert?

1033
01:07:28,154 --> 01:07:30,859
年轻的朋友们  那才是真正的和声
That, my young friend, is true harmony.

1034
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,906
男孩们从不交流这方面的事情
Guys don't talk to each other

1035
01:07:32,992 --> 01:07:34,902
因为他们视彼此如对手
Because they view each other as competitors,

1036
01:07:34,994 --> 01:07:36,702
尽管我觉的这很荒谬
Which I think is crazy. You know?

1037
01:07:36,788 --> 01:07:37,938
男人们也需要同心协力
Because men need to help each other and work together

1038
01:07:37,939 --> 01:07:40,239
如果想把到妹
To get laid.

1039
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:42,624
诺亚・莱文斯坦  70级
Noah Levenstein, class of '70.

1040
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,415
- 皮特・萨姆布雷利  -没错  诺亚・莱文斯坦
- Pete Sambrelli? - That's right, the Noah Levenstein.

1041
01:07:45,505 --> 01:07:46,536
你有他的电话吗
Do you have a number for him?

1042
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:49,087
这是一些关于他对润滑剂的使用建议
This is regarding his advice on the lubricants.

1043
01:07:49,175 --> 01:07:52,378
我们在女王篇发现了舌转风暴功
We found the tongue tornado in Regina.

1044
01:07:53,763 --> 01:07:55,970
还说为朋友两肋插刀
You said bros befo' hos.

1045
01:07:56,057 --> 01:07:58,134
是不是你说的  为朋友两肋插刀
Isn't that what you said? bros befo' hos.

1046
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:00,055
那你还上了我女朋友
And then you screwed my girlfriend.

1047
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:02,422
卡里托  合唱团的人都是这样啊
Well, so did the entire glee club, Carlito.

1048
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:03,181
你什么意思
What's your point?

1049
01:08:05,517 --> 01:08:08,850
都是生理需求  但信心是关键
It's all about chemistry, and confidence is the key.

1050
01:08:13,108 --> 01:08:15,777
相敬如宾  你听过那歌  对不对
R-e-s-p-e-c-t, you've heard that song, right?

1051
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:17,604
孩子们  我们又确认一个
Boys, we got another confirmation.

1052
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:19,273
你要正确的对待你的小姐客户
You gotta treat your lady right.

1053
01:08:19,364 --> 01:08:21,351
你需要温柔和蔼
You've got to be gentle, kind 

1054
01:08:21,353 --> 01:08:24,192
并且尊重你爱的那个人
And respectful to the one you love.

1055
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:26,945
-你在跟谁打电话  -闭嘴
- Who are you talking to? - Shut the fuck up.

1056
01:08:27,038 --> 01:08:28,865
这样你才能让她芳心欲动
This is how you get her really excited.

1057
01:08:28,957 --> 01:08:32,326
把你的手指插入她的屁眼  相信我
Stick your finger in her ass. Trust me.

1058
01:08:32,544 --> 01:08:34,667
用两根还是一根手指
Was that two fingers or one?

1059
01:08:35,463 --> 01:08:37,255
对不起  那是机密
I'm sorry. Confidential matter.

1060
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,460
电话  电话  好的
Phone, phone. Okay.

1061
01:08:41,052 --> 01:08:42,084
然后呢
Then what happened?

1062
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:45,263
你好  对  77级的
Hello. Yeah. Class of '77.

1063
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:46,891
等一下  我找只笔记下
Yeah, hold on. Let me get a pen.

1064
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,090
请皮特・奥唐奈听电话
Pete O'donnell, please.

1065
01:08:48,852 --> 01:08:50,263
你是谁
Who is this?

1066
01:08:51,146 --> 01:08:54,313
奥唐奈先生  我是马歇尔・卢布斯基
Mr O'donnell, this is Marshall Lubetski.

1067
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,234
我想和你交流一下《索爱天书》的内容
I just wanted to talk to you about what you wrote in the Bible.

1068
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:01,316
你知道的  是关于你和约翰逊女士的肛交
You know, about having anal sex with Miss Johnson.

1069
01:09:13,502 --> 01:09:16,337
非常感谢  划掉马克 S.
Thank you very much! Mark S.!

1070
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,512
这不是一本关于性的手册
This is not a sex manual.

1071
01:09:30,852 --> 01:09:33,390
这是人生手册
It is a life manual.

1072
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:37,596
我结婚已经35年了
Now, I've been married for 35 years

1073
01:09:37,692 --> 01:09:41,227
没有离婚不仅是因为我帅
And not just because I'm this handsome dude

1074
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:43,693
知道怎样满足女人
Who knows how to satisfy a woman.

1075
01:09:43,865 --> 01:09:47,945
35年不离不弃是因为我爱我的妻子
I've been married 35 years because I love my wife

1076
01:09:48,036 --> 01:09:50,954
我尊重她
And I respect my wife.

1077
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:53,959
无论是在阿姆斯特丹还是东大瀑布高中
And whether it's Amsterdam or East Great Falls

1078
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:55,750
都因为我爱着她
It all comes down to this.

1079
01:09:55,836 --> 01:09:59,703
如果你真诚并尊重女孩
If you're honest and treat a girl with respect,

1080
01:10:00,757 --> 01:10:03,722
该发生的就会发生
Then whatever happens is meant to happen,

1081
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:06,463
因为这一切都是自然而然的
Because it's all perfectly natural.

1082
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,644
孩子们  兵马未动粮草先行
Boys, I've prepared you for this quest.

1083
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:18,521
在你面前的是人生最大的考验
And before you lies the biggest test of your lives.

1084
01:10:27,284 --> 01:10:29,572
这本书是强大的杀手锏
This book is a powerful weapon,

1085
01:10:31,955 --> 01:10:33,746
好好地利用它吧
So use it for good

1086
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:36,662
别适得其反
Not evil.

1087
01:11:26,259 --> 01:11:27,338
太好了
Yes.

1088
01:11:34,142 --> 01:11:35,767
你还在找吸尘器吗
You still looking for the vacuum?

1089
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:38,937
没  很奇怪它在科迪的房间里
No. I found it in Cody's room. So strange.

1090
01:11:39,022 --> 01:11:42,058
我是说我都忘了放在那里了
I mean, I just don't remember leaving it there.

1091
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,977
显然我糊涂了
Losing my mind, clearly.

1092
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:46,607
妈妈  我可以参加滑雪旅行吗
Hey, mom, can I go on the ski trip?

1093
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,569
好
Yes.

1094
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,405
但是别喝酒  如果喝了别开车
But no drinking, and if you do drink, no driving.

1095
01:11:54,496 --> 01:11:56,193
别担心 如果我做糗事 
Don't worry. If I do anything wrong

1096
01:11:56,194 --> 01:11:57,891
Youtube上肯定马上就有了
I'm sure it'll end up on youtube, so.

1097
01:11:58,124 --> 01:12:00,117
到了给你打电话
Call you when I get there.

1098
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:21,188
喝酒的环节到了
Drinking round!

1099
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:32,278
-我也要参加  -你在这里干嘛啊
- Deal me in. - What are you doing here?

1100
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:33,398
我叫凯蒂
Katie.

1101
01:12:33,493 --> 01:12:35,818
我知道  但你在这里做什么呢
I know. But what are you doing here?

1102
01:12:35,912 --> 01:12:38,403
-我也想参加  -好
- I wanna play. - Right.

1103
01:12:38,498 --> 01:12:40,128
斯戴福尔  让她参加吧  
Just deal her in, Stifler.

1104
01:12:40,129 --> 01:12:40,740
有什么关系呢
What's the big deal?

1105
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:42,494
让她参加吧
Yeah, deal her in.

1106
01:12:48,884 --> 01:12:50,259
内森
Hi, Nathan.

1107
01:12:53,096 --> 01:12:54,756
谢谢你的花
Thanks for the flowers.

1108
01:12:54,848 --> 01:12:56,574
我为我以前的行为道歉
I'm sorry about being a jerk.

1109
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,299
而且我已经自尝苦果
And, for the record, I've learned my lesson.

1110
01:12:58,393 --> 01:13:01,347
我会尊敬你并支持你的的誓言
I'm ready to respect you and support you on your pledge.

1111
01:13:01,438 --> 01:13:04,889
真的吗  为什么呢
Really? But why?

1112
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:09,568
我是因为你  而不是性这么做的
I'm in this for you. I'm not in it just to have sex.

1113
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:12,942
我意识到我是因为你才这么做
Well, I realised that I'm in this for you

1114
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:15,906
如果誓言祈祷了某种作用
And if the pledge gets in the way of that

1115
01:13:15,907 --> 01:13:16,865
那这个作用会有多好的效果呢
then how good can it really be?

1116
01:13:16,953 --> 01:13:19,126
我们两个好像结成了统一战线
Sounds like a good basis for the two

1117
01:13:19,126 --> 01:13:21,662
我们好好玩静观其变
Of us to just relax and see what happens.

1118
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:24,615
看我带来一本书
Look. I bought a book.

1119
01:13:25,462 --> 01:13:27,454
我正想我们两个
I was thinking that we could

1120
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:29,255
可以从第一页开始然后
Start on page one and then

1121
01:13:29,256 --> 01:13:30,963
看周末我们能读到哪里
see how far we get this weekend.

1122
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:33,960
前三章是前奏
The first three chapters are foreplay.

1123
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:39,097
你知道吗  我也正在看一本书
You know, I've actually been reading a book, as well.

1124
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:42,220
你听过舌转风暴吗
Have you ever heard of the Tongue Tornado?

1125
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:44,355
我们走
Okay, let's go.

1126
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:50,977
这肯定很好玩
This is supposed to be fun.

1127
01:13:51,363 --> 01:13:52,905
一点都不好玩
This isn't fun.

1128
01:13:53,073 --> 01:13:56,239
等一下  你现在智力无边
Just you wait. You possess wisdom now.

1129
01:13:56,993 --> 01:13:58,653
相信这本书吧
Trust in the book.

1130
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,103
我想问那到底什么意思呢
I mean, what does that mean, anyway?

1131
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:07,294
你觉得我会不会太粘人了
Do you think I'm too clingy?

1132
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:09,746
当然不是
No. no, of course not.

1133
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,714
你知道怎么打扑克吗
Do you even know how to play poker?

1134
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,831
我知道这个游戏
I know the game.

1135
01:14:12,926 --> 01:14:16,674
如果我输了  我就脱光衣服
And I tell you what, if I lose, I'll take off all my clothes.

1136
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,760
哟  棒极了
Snap. Nice.

1137
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:22,345
那我输了呢
And if I lose?

1138
01:14:22,727 --> 01:14:24,519
向我道歉
You apologise to me.

1139
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,806
-为什么呢  甩了你  -对
- For what? Blowing you off?  - Yes.

1140
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:30,686
道歉还不够  那是我的第一次
If it's not enough, it was my first time.

1141
01:14:30,902 --> 01:14:31,934
你应该给我更多
I deserve better.

1142
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:37,815
如果我赢了  你不仅要道歉
But if I win, not only do you apologise to me

1143
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:40,116
你得全裸在雪地里跑
You gotta run through the snow naked.

1144
01:14:42,164 --> 01:14:45,034
-太棒了  -一言为定
- Yeah. - It's a deal.

1145
01:14:53,049 --> 01:14:55,208
亲爱的  开始脱衣服吧
Start stripping, sweetheart.

1146
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:57,170
还没有结束呢
It's not over yet.

1147
01:14:59,848 --> 01:15:01,342
运气好吗
Feeling lucky?

1148
01:15:03,351 --> 01:15:06,388
你最好期待会有一个5
You better hope for a five on the river, baby.

1149
01:15:14,404 --> 01:15:16,729
她真拿到了5  太不可思议了
She got the five! Unbelievable.

1150
01:15:18,241 --> 01:15:19,570
天啊
Oh, my god.

1151
01:15:21,244 --> 01:15:22,904
-脱掉  -等一下
- Strip. - Hold on a second.

1152
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:24,490
-脱掉  -脱掉
- Strip. - Strip.

1153
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:27,535
脱掉  脱掉  脱掉  脱掉
 strip! strip! strip! strip!

1154
01:15:27,626 --> 01:15:32,703
脱掉  脱掉  脱掉  脱掉
Strip! strip! strip! strip!

1155
01:15:32,797 --> 01:15:35,882
你们想让我全裸  你们想看吧
You want me to strip? You want some of this?

1156
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:39,547
宝贝们  我真脱了
It's time to get it going, baby!

1157
01:15:41,348 --> 01:15:44,349
好啊  我们走
All right, let's go! here we go, baby.

1158
01:15:45,977 --> 01:15:48,100
等一下  我们再谈谈吧
Wait, let's talk this over.

1159
01:15:50,398 --> 01:15:53,352
该死的  外面冷死了
Shit. it's freezing out here.

1160
01:15:53,527 --> 01:15:55,069
现在道歉
Now apologise.

1161
01:15:55,362 --> 01:15:57,153
-对不起  -为什么呢
- I'm sorry. - For what?

1162
01:15:57,531 --> 01:16:00,022
因为之后我没有给你打电话
I'm sorry for not calling you afterwards.

1163
01:16:00,116 --> 01:16:01,361
还有呢
And what else?

1164
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:03,859
我猪狗不如  好了吧
I'm sorry for being a dick, okay?

1165
01:16:04,246 --> 01:16:06,369
现在  打开这该死的门
Now, open the stinking door.

1166
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:19,009
开门
Open the door!

1167
01:16:19,094 --> 01:16:23,590
告诉所有人你进来后会如何哭
Now, tell everyone how you cry like a little girl after you come.

1168
01:16:23,682 --> 01:16:26,255
像娘们儿一样哭好吧
I cry like a girl after I come, okay?

1169
01:16:26,977 --> 01:16:29,432
那可是我的极限了
It's a very intense experience for me.

1170
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:36,356
报警
Call 911 .

1171
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,839
待会去屋里找你
Hey, I'll meet you at the lodge later.

1172
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,211
好啊
Yeah, yeah, sure. go.

1173
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:54,760
海蒂  等一下
Heidi. Wait up.

1174
01:18:02,986 --> 01:18:05,441
你介意我和你一起坐吗
Do you mind if I ride up with you?

1175
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:06,943
不介意
Okay.

1176
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,266
还好吗
Hey. What's up?

1177
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:42,273
我们一起坐缆车
We...we're in the same gondola.

1178
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,610
对啊
Yeah, look at that.

1179
01:18:56,206 --> 01:18:57,486
天啊
Oh, god.

1180
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:15,849
我并没有和斯戴福尔上床
I didn't sleep with Stifler.

1181
01:19:15,934 --> 01:19:17,642
嗯  我听说
Yeah. I heard.

1182
01:19:18,812 --> 01:19:20,934
-你还在讨厌我吗  -没有啊
- But you still hate me? - No.

1183
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,516
你为什么这样说呢
No. Why would you say that?

1184
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:27,693
那晚后你都没和我讲过一句话
You haven't said a word to me since that night.

1185
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,355
我知道  对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

1186
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:35,025
我觉得我需要时间整理一下思绪
I guess I just... I needed time to work through my feelings.

1187
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:43,244
然后呢  决定什么了吗
And? What did you decide?

1188
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:48,225
吉布斯说斯戴福尔不得不
Gibbs says that Stifler has to sit

1189
01:19:48,225 --> 01:19:50,248
在泡沫橡胶甜甜圈垫子上坐六周
On a foam rubber doughnut for six weeks.

1190
01:19:50,343 --> 01:19:52,089
他说斯戴福尔
And he says they're talking about 

1191
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,127
因为冻伤要截肢
Amputating his feet from frostbite.

1192
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:57,389
吉布斯是骗子  斯戴福尔不用截肢的
Gibbs is a liar. Stifler doesn't need amputation.

1193
01:19:57,475 --> 01:20:00,049
那可太坏了  我在商店里做爱都得过A
That's too bad. I got an A in shop.

1194
01:20:05,859 --> 01:20:07,732
天啊  那是喷鼻声吗
Oh, my. Was that a snort?

1195
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,995
心满意足了吧
Come to gloat?

1196
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,208
只是在找同性恋罢了
No. Just looking for a fag.

1197
01:20:26,379 --> 01:20:30,080
我和一只麋鹿做了并不代表我是同性恋
Just 'cause I took a moose pickle up my ass doesn't mean I'm gay.

1198
01:20:30,175 --> 01:20:33,010
很搞笑  屁股怎么样了
Very funny. How's your bum?

1199
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:37,222
好像生了一堆蛋黄酱  不过谢谢关心
Feels like I gave birth to a mayonnaise jar, but thanks for asking.

1200
01:20:37,974 --> 01:20:41,094
我听说了你的男朋友  真要命
Hey, I heard about your boyfriend. that really sucks.

1201
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:44,389
我还以为只有高中男生是混蛋呢
Yeah. I thought only high school boys were jerks.

1202
01:20:44,481 --> 01:20:46,188
事实并非如此
It turns out they never outgrow it.

1203
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,732
伊莫金 希望你不介意
Lmogen, no offence, and

1204
01:20:47,732 --> 01:20:49,975
你是我见过最成熟的女孩
you're the most mature girl I know,

1205
01:20:50,653 --> 01:20:54,568
但是24岁的男人不适合你
But a 24-year-old dude isn't gonna take a high-school girl seriously.

1206
01:20:54,657 --> 01:20:56,068
我想不是吧
I suppose not.

1207
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,903
要坐下吗
You wanna sit down?

1208
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:00,824
为什么
What for?

1209
01:21:00,997 --> 01:21:03,951
我认为我们可以共同用一个朋友
I just thought we could both use a friend right now.

1210
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:17,669
斯戴福尔
Stifler.

1211
01:21:17,764 --> 01:21:19,306
我错了  本能反应
My bad. reflex.

1212
01:21:22,435 --> 01:21:23,810
对不起
I'm sorry.

1213
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:25,509
你得自己做决定
You have to make your own decisions.

1214
01:21:25,605 --> 01:21:29,555
我还以为我们关系非同寻常
You know, I just... I thought we had something.

1215
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:30,896
我们以前是啊
We did.

1216
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:33,768
现在也是
We do.

1217
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:36,615
我很害怕
I was scared.

1218
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:38,570
为什么呢
Of what?

1219
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,121
我真的喜欢你
I really like you.

1220
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,950
我只是想初夜非同一般
And I want it to be special.

1221
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:52,545
我只想做做准备工作
I guess I just wanted to be ready.

1222
01:21:54,551 --> 01:21:58,963
你和斯戴福尔上床只是为我做准备工作
So you almost had sex with stifler so you'd be ready for me.

1223
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,469
对
Yeah.

1224
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:05,227
这是我听过最蠢的话
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1225
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:08,886
我听说你有过些经验
Well, I heard you got some practise.

1226
01:22:09,566 --> 01:22:12,483
其实事实上是什么也没有
You know, the truth is, is nothing happened.

1227
01:22:14,445 --> 01:22:17,233
我不想那么随意
I didn't want it to be random like that.

1228
01:22:17,448 --> 01:22:18,647
而且
And...

1229
01:22:21,411 --> 01:22:25,455
我不想我的第一次给除了你之外的人
I couldn't picture my first time being with anybody else but you.

1230
01:22:45,935 --> 01:22:47,430
怎么了
What was that?

1231
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:49,812
不知道
I don't know.

1232
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:55,108
-好像我们被困住了  -对
- Looks like we're stuck. - Yeah.

1233
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:04,367
我们可能会在这里待上一段时间
You know, we could be up here for a while.

1234
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:05,533
对
Yeah.

1235
01:23:31,648 --> 01:23:33,439
我能问你一些问题吗
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1236
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:35,233
对  随意问
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1237
01:23:35,318 --> 01:23:37,856
你为什么和像斯戴福尔那样的人渣搞在一起
Why do you hook up with assholes like scott stifler anyway?

1238
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:40,234
你说什么啊  你都不了解我
Excuse me, but you don't know me.

1239
01:23:40,323 --> 01:23:43,490
你和其它人都是一样的
You know, you're just the same as all the rest.

1240
01:23:43,576 --> 01:23:44,739
我只是一种战利品
I'm just some sort of trophy to you.

1241
01:23:44,828 --> 01:23:47,283
你并不关心我  只关心和我睡觉的事
You don't care about me. You just wanna sleep with me,

1242
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:50,207
你认为这是值得炫耀的事
Because you think it's some sort of status symbol.

1243
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,454
不好意思
Sorry.

1244
01:23:53,878 --> 01:23:54,910
天啊
God.

1245
01:23:56,506 --> 01:23:58,878
我们会在这里待多久呢
How long are we gonna be up here?

1246
01:24:00,718 --> 01:24:02,213
我来求助
I'll get help.

1247
01:24:03,847 --> 01:24:05,257
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

1248
01:24:05,348 --> 01:24:08,100
这儿并不高  而且有20英尺左右的雪
It's not that far down, and there's, like, 20 feet of snow.

1249
01:24:08,184 --> 01:24:10,177
这是你想在我面前表现的吗
What, is this supposed to impress me?

1250
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,309
曾经想过
The thought had crossed my mind.

1251
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:14,473
别这样做  第一  这是错误的
Absolutely not. first of all, it's just wrong.

1252
01:24:14,566 --> 01:24:16,854
第二  你都不能碰到那扇门
Second of all, you're not even supposed to touch the door.

1253
01:24:16,943 --> 01:24:18,403
第三  这十分危险 
And third, it's just really dangerous, okay?

1254
01:24:18,403 --> 01:24:21,190
别这样  过来
So just get away from there.

1255
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:23,736
对啊  我在想什么呢
Right. What was I thinking?

1256
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,625
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1257
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,204
我的腿好像受伤了
I think I hurt my leg.

1258
01:24:36,754 --> 01:24:37,869
笨蛋
Idiot.

1259
01:24:53,229 --> 01:24:54,723
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1260
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:57,191
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

1261
01:24:58,359 --> 01:24:59,818
没事吧
Are you okay?

1262
01:25:00,445 --> 01:25:03,648
没事  没事
Yeah, I'm fine. no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1263
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:07,275
你刚刚说我不关心你
About what you said about how I don't care about you

1264
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:10,120
你只是一个战利品  那都不是真的  
And you're just a trophy, that's actually not true.

1265
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:14,748
我真的喜欢你  我们一起上的小学
I really like you. We went to elementary school together.

1266
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:18,209
我还记得你在六年级表演唱的《嘿  你好》
I remember when you sang Hey Ya! in the sixth-grade talent show.

1267
01:25:18,296 --> 01:25:21,588
我还记得你在回家游戏中从金字塔上摔下
I remember when you fell off the pyramid at the homecoming game

1268
01:25:21,588 --> 01:25:22,424
大一的时候
Freshman year.

1269
01:25:22,509 --> 01:25:25,379
你当时很  不过我不介意
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

1270
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:29,254
摔下就好像是你表演的一部分
I just liked how you played it off like it was all part of the routine.

1271
01:25:29,349 --> 01:25:33,025
是啊  你是学校的风云人物
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe,

1272
01:25:33,025 --> 01:25:35,932
我只是喜欢你这个人
But I actually like you for you.

1273
01:25:38,107 --> 01:25:40,812
可能你会觉得很突兀
Look, this may be a shock to you,

1274
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:45,149
但我不知道怎么和女孩交流
But I have no idea what I'm doing with girls.

1275
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:48,199
我真的想好好学学 
But I really wanna learn.

1276
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,033
你给了我机会
You just give me a chance.

1277
01:25:50,954 --> 01:25:52,827
这是我所有的愿望
That's all I'm asking.

1278
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:57,537
我保证我会为你的幸福
And I guarantee that I will make it my life's mission

1279
01:25:57,627 --> 01:26:00,961
奋斗终生
To satisfy you in every way possible.

1280
01:26:37,584 --> 01:26:40,205
-走  我们回去  -回到缆车上
- Let's go back to the... - to the cabin.

1281
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,265
伙计  你忘了签字了
Dude. You forgot to sign it.

1282
01:27:47,821 --> 01:27:50,394
你确定我们不能再留它一年吗
You sure we can't just keep it for one more year?

1283
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:52,482
不能  轮到其他人了
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.

1284
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:38,491
这是我的弟弟科迪
Rob on computer. This is my little brother, Cody,

1285
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,614
他每天都用吸尘器这样做
And this is what he does with the vacuum every day.

1286
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:45,542
天啊
No! hey! no!

1287
01:28:46,045 --> 01:28:49,130
救命啊  塞住了  我不能把它取下来
Help! it's stuck! I can't get it off!

1288
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:53,250
救命啊  塞住了
Help! Help! it's stuck.

1289
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:55,049
逮住你了
Gotcha.

1290
01:28:56,347 --> 01:28:57,462
救命
Help!

1291
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:01,800
不
No!

1292
01:29:05,356 --> 01:29:10,018
她过去利用我  真糟糕
She was using me. l...that was really bad.

1293
01:29:10,403 --> 01:29:12,811
神父  你为什么抛弃了我
Father, why hast thou forsaken me?

1294
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:16,367
想更淫荡地对我口淫吗
Wanna suck me off in the sharper lmage?

1295
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:19,329
罗伯  你是不是特会甜言蜜语啊
Rob, are you some kind of jive turkey?

1296
01:29:21,372 --> 01:29:24,409
他都不像他本人了
He's like an inch away from the real McCoy.

1297
01:29:25,084 --> 01:29:26,958
带避孕套了吗
Did you bring condoms?

1298
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:28,207
什么
What?

1299
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:31,416
我从13岁开始就想做爱了
I wet the bed until I was 13 years old, okay?

1300
01:29:31,549 --> 01:29:34,087
你们没有机会去乔纳斯兄弟的演唱会
You nancy boys couldn't get lucky at a Jonas Brothers concert

1301
01:29:34,177 --> 01:29:36,300
纵使有很多后台通行证
With a fistful of backstage passes.

1302
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:40,428
相信上帝和他对生命永恒的承诺
Faith in god and his promise of eternal life.

1303
01:29:42,018 --> 01:29:44,972
现在  把避孕套套上香蕉
Now, put the condom on the banana.

1304
01:29:46,022 --> 01:29:49,687
谁没有看到啊  看看时间  得走了
Who didn't see that coming? Look at the time. gotta go.

1305
01:29:50,735 --> 01:29:53,487
我觉得关于拉拉队的照片太多了
I think that is quite enough pictures of the cheerleaders.

1306
01:29:53,571 --> 01:29:55,030
照点比赛的
How about we get some of the game?

1307
01:29:56,533 --> 01:29:57,612
正吃着呢
We're eating.

1308
01:29:59,744 --> 01:30:02,152
你们是该死的美国人吗
You've been fucking americans or...

1309
01:30:02,789 --> 01:30:04,497
看着  爱着
Watching, loving...

1310
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:09,200
容忍我一下
Bear with me.

1311
01:30:09,295 --> 01:30:12,166
如果她沮丧  送她花
If she's down, bring her flowers.

1312
01:30:12,465 --> 01:30:14,956
她渴了  给她来一杯香槟
If she's thirsty, serve her fine champagne.

1313
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:17,423
我告诉你  我妻子太他妈性感了
Yeah, 'cause, I'm telling you, my wife is pretty effing hot.

1314
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:20,963

I'm talking a tight, tight ass and squeaky clean.

1315

很多奶油吗  太好了
Is that cream-filled? You rock.

1316
01:30:25,103 --> 01:30:27,261
拜托你别提了
Oh. Don't mention that, okay?

1317
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:29,041
做爱的时候  
And whenever it comes to making out, 

1318
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:32,310
摆出齐柏林飞船四世(乐队)的架子
Put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.
