00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,640
去告訴風紀組我的身心正常
Now,will you tell I.A. I'm just your average...

137
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,240
是個完全健全的好警察…
healthy, totally fucked up cop...

138
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,340
放我出去吧，求求你？
and let me out of here,please?

139
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,790
好的
Yes.

140
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,860
謝謝
Thank you.

141
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,770
我還在想念你，尼克
I still miss you,Nick.

142
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,620
-尼克，還好吧？ -還好
- How are you doing? - Fine.

143
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,650
塔克他們在等你
Tallcott's in there. They're waiting. How did it go?

144
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
她說仍想念我
She misses me.

145
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,530
你這輩子擺脫不了了
Boy,when that girl mates, it's for life.

146
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,720
咱們開始吧
All right,let's start. Harrigan.

147
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,270
頸部和胸部有31處刺傷
Well,we got 31 stab wounds, neck and the chest.

148
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,770
沒有可用的指紋
No usable prints, no forceable entry,nothing missing.

149
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,640
冰錐上也沒有指紋. 市場內到處可以買到
No prints on the ice pick,either. You can pick it up at any KMart.

150
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,670
用的是愛美仕牌的昂貴絲巾
The scarf was Hermes. It's expensive.

151
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,770
全世界一年售出兩萬條
They sell about 20,000 a year, worldwide.

152
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,810
那個粉末是高純度的可卡因， 他有吸了一些
Bottle was cocaine. High quality, high content. He inhaled it.

153
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
嘴唇和生殖器上也沾了一點
There were minute quantities on his lips and penis.

154
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,880
他留下五百萬美元遺產
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million.

155
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,090
沒有直接繼承人，也沒前科
No direct survivors. No criminal record.

156
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,420
他喜歡毒品，女孩和搖滾樂
He liked his drugs. He liked his girls. He liked his rock and roll.

157
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,090
他也喜歡市長，不是嗎？
He liked the mayor too,right?

158
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,670
他的女友呢？
What about his girlfriend?

159
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,760
-她有嫌疑嗎？ -她有嫌疑
- Is she relevant here? Is she a suspect? - She's a suspect.

160
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,400
根據什麼線索？
On what basis?

161
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,600
"女友是三十歲的凱瑟琳楚梅. 沒有前科，沒有犯罪記錄
"Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell. Age 30. No priors. No convictions.

162
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,150
一九八三年畢業於柏克萊
Magna cum laude at Berkeley,1983.

163
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,780
雙主修:文學及心理學
Double major: Literature and psychology.

164
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,480
父母在七九年一次船難喪生…
Daughter,sole survivor, Marvin and Elaine Tramell...

165
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,850
她是唯一生還的獨生女， 也是唯一財產繼承人
killed in a boating accident,1979.

166
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,460
其財富估計為一億一千萬."
Catherine Tramell,sole heir. Estimated assets: $ 110 million."

167
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,460
你沒亂蓋？
You're shitting me.

168
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,290
"曾嫁給曼尼瓦斯卡…"
"Formerly engaged to Manuel Vasquez,deceased."

169
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,760
你說的是那個曼尼瓦斯卡？
Whoa,whoa! Manny Vasquez?

170
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,460
沒錯，前任中量級拳王， 死於八四年一場拳賽
Former middleweight contender. Killed in the ring,Atlantic City,1984.

171
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,700
太好了，她有著數億元身價
I love it. She's got 100 million bucks.

172
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,800
他操拳王和搖滾歌手…
She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars...

173
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,170
還有精神病的學位 知道怎樣干人的腦袋
and she's got a degree in screwing with people's heads.

174
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,180
你忘了她還有文學學位. 她還是個作家
You forgot about her degree in literature. She's a writer.

175
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,370
去年用筆名出版了一本書.猜猜看內容？
She published a novel under a pen name. Want to know what it's about?

176
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,420
是講一個被女友謀殺的搖滾歌手
It's about a retired rock and roll star who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

177
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,470
翻到67頁，老大
Page 67,cowboy.

178
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,840
你猜她怎樣對付她的男友？
You know how she does the boyfriend?

179
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,640
在床上用一根冰錐…
With an ice pick,in bed...

180
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,170
用白色絲斤綁在床上
his hands tied with a white silk scarf.

181
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,690
嘉納大夫
Dr. Garner.

182
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,790
我請拉蒙大夫過來討論. 這件事我擔當不起
I've asked Dr. Lamont to consult with us. This isn't really my turf.

183
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,390
拉蒙大夫在史丹佛大學 教授變態心理…
Dr. Lamont teaches the pathology of psychopathic behavior at Stanford...

184
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,860
也是司法部犯罪心理組的成員
and also on the Justice Department Psychological Profile Team.

185
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,860
請說
Dr. Lamont.

186
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
我想有兩種可能
I see two possibilities.

187
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,840
第一點: 寫出這本書的人，就是凶手…
One: The person who wrote this book is your murderer...

188
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,370
完全根據書上儀式進行殺人
and acted out the killing described in ritualistic,literal detail.

189
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,510
第二點: 有人想嫁禍給本書作者…
Two: Someone who wants to harm the writer...

190
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,180
看到這本書正好利用機會
read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate her.

191
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,820
若是作者干的，我們該怎麼辦？
What if the writer did it? Then what are we dealing with?

192
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,420
你們面對一個邪惡無比的心靈
You're dealing with a devious,diabolical mind.

193
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,900
這本書在出版之前 至少花了半年才完成--
You see,this book had to have been written at least six months...

194
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,790
這表示作者早在構思之前 在潛意識中已經有了計劃
maybe even years... before it was published...

195
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,630
這表示作者早在構思之前 在潛意識中已經有了計劃
which means the writer must have planned the crime in the subconscious back then.

196
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,830
而她執行的方式…
Now,the fact that she carried it out...

197
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,170
顯示著強烈的變態行為…
indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior...

198
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,210
不僅是殺人本身…
in terms not only of the killing itself...

199
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,110
而是一種侵略性的強烈本能
but also in terms of the applied advance defense mechanism.

200
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,140
有時候我真被搞糊塗了
Sometimes I can't tell shit from shinola,Doc.

201
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,690
你剛說的那些字眼是什麼意思？
What was all that you just said?

202
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,420
-她利用那本書作掩護. -沒錯
- She intended the book to be her alibi. - Correct.

203
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,190
一個人會用自己書中描述的方式
She's going to say,"Do you think I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone...

204
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,590
去謀殺一個人嗎？
in the exact way I described in my book?"

205
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,760
我不會笨到拿自己當嫌疑犯
I wouldn't do that because I know I'd be the suspect.

206
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,670
假如不是作者呢？ 假設是別人看到這本書？
So,what if it's not the writer? What if it's someone who read the book?

207
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,200
你面對一位瘋狂的殺手…
You're dealing,then, with someone so obsessed...

208
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,600
不論是男女 會殺害一切不相關的人…
that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim...

209
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,740
只為了嫁禍給本書作者
in order to place the blame on the person who wrote that book.

210
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,610
這是一種深藏在內心裡的仇恨…
I'm talking about a deep-seated obsessional hatred...

211
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,590
對於人命毫不尊重
and an utter lack of respect for human life.

212
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:42,460
所以我們遇到一位千載難逢 世間少見的瘋子
So,we got a once in a lifetime, top of the line looney-tuney.

213
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,620
你是這個意思嗎？
That's what you're saying, right,Doc?

214
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,640
這個凶手十分危險…
You're dealing with someone very dangerous...

215
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,470
而且變態
and very ill.

216
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,480
你明知不可能的. 你根本沒有具體證據
You know there's no case here. You've got no physical evidence.

217
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,110
她沒有不在場證明
She hasn't got an alibi.

218
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,120
她也沒動機. 相信我的話…
She hasn't got a motive,either. Believe me...

219
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,880
辯護根本會打得我們 無招架之力
her defense would just beat us to death with this copycat thing.

220
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,490
看過這本書的人都有嫌疑
Anybody who read the book could have done it.

221
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,790
-你打算什麼都不做？ -我們叫她來問話
- What do you want to do now? Nothing? - We call her in for questioning.

222
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,800
她有的是錢， 我們根本弄不過--
She's got enough money to burn the department down...

223
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,270
她是最後一位見到死者的人
She was the last person seen with the guy.

224
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,910
一切由我負責
I'll take the responsibility.

225
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,110
交給你了
It's yours.

226
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,780
這樣沒用的
It won't do any good.

227
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,110
她會找個明星律師辯護…
She'll just waltz in with some superstar lawyer...

228
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,880
我們只是浪費納稅人的錢
who'll get us all canned for wasting the taxpayers' money.

229
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,520
-她一定會那樣做. -不會的
- That's exactly what she'll do. - No,she won't.

230
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,880
我認為她不會找律師
I don't think she'll hide behind anybody.

231
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,190
她誰都不用找
I don't think she's gonna hide at all.

232
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,200
也許她跟你一樣神經，柯倫
Then she's as crazy as you are,Curran.

233
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,200
俗話說得好:
You know what they say:

234
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,770
一物克一物
Takes one to know one.

235
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,360
我們想請你到局裡問話
Miss Tramell,we'd like you to come downtown to answer a few questions.

236
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,540
你們要逮捕我？
Are you arresting me?

237
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,640
你喜歡那樣嗎
If that's the way you want to play it.

238
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,870
我能換一下衣服嗎？
Could I change into something more appropriate?

239
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,380
一下就好，請進
It'll only take a minute. Come on in.

240
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,580
你們隨便坐，我馬上來
Make yourselves comfortable. I'll be right back.

241
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,400
加斯
- Hey,Gus. - Hmm?

242
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,410
-要花多少時間？ -不知道
- So,how long is this gonna take? - I don't know.

243
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,850
你喜歡保有舊報紙嗎？
Do you always keep old newspapers around?

244
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,850
只收集有趣的新聞
Only when they make interesting reading.

245
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,300
-我准備好了. -你可以請律師
- I'm ready. - You have the right to an attorney.

246
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,840
我要律師干嘛？
Why would I need an attorney?

247
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,880
-有煙嗎？ -我不吸煙的
- Do you have a cigarette? - I don't smoke.

248
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,890
你會吸煙
Yes,you do.

249
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,590
-我戒了. -恭喜你
- I quit. - Congratulations.

250
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,770
我以為你自己沒煙
I thought you didn't have any cigarettes.

251
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,670
我剛在口袋裡找到，要不要？
Oh,I found some in my pocket. Would you like one?

252
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,780
我說過我戒了
I told you,I quit.

253
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,250
戒不了多久的
It won't last.

254
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,420
-你在寫新書嗎？ -是的
- You working on another book? - Yes,I am.

255
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,260
寫這種書可真是了不起
It must really be something making stuff up all the time.

256
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,790
可以練習說謊
Yeah,it teaches you to lie.

257
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,840
感覺怎樣？
How's that?

258
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,770
你自己編造一些故事，卻使人相信. 這稱作不定的不信狀態
You make up believable stuff. It's called suspension of disbelief.

259
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,400
太好了！
I like that! Suspension of disbelief.

260
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,170
你的新書寫些什麼？
What's your new book about?

261
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,080
一個探長愛上了不該愛的女人
A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.

262
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,300
然後呢？
What happens?

263
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,490
她把他宰了
She kills him.

264
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,210
我是約翰卡拉利，地方檢察官
I'm John Carreli,Miss Tramell, assistant district attorney.

265
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,310
這段過程會錄制下來
I have to inform you this session's being taped.

266
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,250
-這是塔可組長. -幸會
- This is Captain Tallcott. - My pleasure.

267
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,350
這是華克組長
- And Lieutenant Walker. - Hi.

268
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,860
-要不要喝杯咖啡？ -不用，謝了
- Can we get you a cup of coffee? - No,thank you.

269
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,890
要請律師參加嗎？
Are your attorneys going to join us?

270
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,290
她放棄請律師的權利
Miss Tramell has waived her rights to an attorney.

271
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,300
有什麼事嗎？
Did I miss something?

272
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,340
我說你不想請律師
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.

273
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,200
你為何放棄請律師的權利？
Why have you waived your right to an attorney,Miss Tramell?

274
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,210
你們為何認為我有需要？
Why did you think I wouldn't want one?

275
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,470
我說過你不想請律師
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.

276
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,210
我沒什麼好隱藏的
I have nothing to hide.

277
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,350
這裡不能抽煙
There's no smoking in this building.

278
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,460
你們想告我抽煙嗎？
What are you gonna do? Charge me with smoking?

279
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,240
請告訴我們你和巴茲的關系
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

280
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,250
我和他大約有一年半的性交往
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.

281
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,520
我喜歡和他性交
I liked having sex with him.

282
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,160
他不怕進行實驗
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.

283
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,260
我喜歡那種男人
I like men like that.

284
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,460
能夠給我樂趣的男人
Men who give me pleasure.

285
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,500
他給我很多樂趣
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

286
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:05,170
你們可曾有進行任何 性虐待的活動？
You ever engage in any sadomasochistic activity?

287
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,820
你想的一點也不錯
Exactly what did you have in mind,Mr. Carreli?

288
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,490
-你會把他綁起來？ -沒有
- You ever tie him up? - No.

289
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,110
你從未把他綁起來？
You never tied him up?

290
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,130
沒有
No.

291
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,890
強尼喜歡利用雙手
Johnny liked to use his hands too much.

292
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,120
我喜歡手掌和手指
I like hands and fingers.

293
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,390
你在書中提到白色的絲巾
You describe a white silk scarf in your book.

294
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,200
我一向喜歡用白色的絲巾
I've always had a fondness for white silk scarves.

295
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,210
任何場合都適用
They're good for all occasions.

296
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,800
你說你喜歡男人用手是嗎？
But you said you liked men to use their hands,didn't you?

297
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,470
不是，我喜歡強尼用他的手
No,I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.

298
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,520
我不會制定規則，尼克. 我一向順其自然
I don't make any rules,Nick. I go with the flow.

299
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,490
你殺了巴茲嗎？
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Miss Tramell?

300
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,530
我沒有笨到 用我自己書中的方法…
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about killing...

301
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,530
去殺一個人
and then kill somebody the way I described it in my book.

302
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,470
再宣布自己是凶手. 我沒那麼笨
I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid.

303
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,470
我們知道你沒那麼笨
We know you're not stupid.

304
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,440
或許那正是你脫罪的方法
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.

305
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,240
寫一本書來做籍口
Writing the book gives you an alibi.

306
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,870
沒錯！不是嗎
Yes,it does.

307
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,440
我說不是. 不是我殺的
The answer's no. I didn't kill him.

308
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,250
-你有吸毒嗎？ -有時候
- Do you use drugs,Miss Tramell? - Sometimes.

309
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,260
-和巴茲一起吸毒嗎？ -當然
- Did you ever use drugs with Mr. Boz? - Sure.

310
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,480
哪一種毒品？
What kind of drugs?

311
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,620
可卡因
Cocaine.

312
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,820
你吸過可卡因嗎？尼克
Have you ever fucked on cocaine,Nick?

313
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,880
味道好極了
It's nice.

314
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,480
你喜歡玩游戲對不對？
You like playing games,don't you?

315
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,550
我有心理學學位，這是我專長
I have a degree in psychology. It goes with the turf.

316
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,390
游戲很有意思
Games are fun.

317
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,130
拳擊也很有意思
What about boxing? That's a game. Is that fun too?

318
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,300
我認為那根本不相干
I don't think that's relevant to this inquiry.

319
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,860
曼尼死之前是很有意思
Boxing was fun 'til Manny died.

320
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,670
你當時感覺如何？
How did you feel when he died?

321
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,370
我愛他，那令我傷心
I loved him. It hurt.

322
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,710
你知道強尼死時感覺如何？
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died?

323
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,610
我認為我有一位讀者在玩游戲
I felt like someone had read my book and was playing a game.

324
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,240
-但你不傷心？ -是的
- But it didn't hurt? - No.

325
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,620
-因為你不愛他. -沒錯
- Because you didn't love him? - That's right.

326
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,250
雖然你在操他？
Even though you were fucking him?

327
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,260
仍然樂趣無窮
You still get the pleasure.

328
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,160
你結婚時沒操過別人嗎？
Didn't you ever fuck anybody else when you were married,Nick?

329
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,660
我怎麼知道他結婚了？
How'd you know he was married?

330
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,220
或許我只是瞎猜
Maybe I was just guessing.

331
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,530
那有什麼差別？
What difference does it make?

332
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,400
要一支煙嗎？尼克
Would you like a cigarette,Nick?

333
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,220
-你們相識嗎？ -不認識
- Do you two know each other? - No.

334
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,380
你是如何認識巴茲的？
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

335
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,750
我想寫一本書有關搖滾歌手 被謀殺的記事
I wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock and roll star.

336
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,430
然後我在俱樂部中挑上他. 我們發生了性關系
I went down to his club, I picked him up and I had sex with him.

337
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,660
你對他沒別的感覺 只是為了寫書才和他上床
You didn't feel anything for him? You just had sex with him for your book?

338
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,430
那是開始. 然後我喜歡上他為我做的
In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me.

339
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,440
那不是太冷酷了一點
That's pretty cold,ain't it,lady?

340
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,210
我是個作家，我得利用別人
I'm a writer. I use people for what I write.

341
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,370
讓世人去評定
Let the world beware.

342
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,580
讓我做個測謊機試驗
Do you want me to take a lie detector test?

343
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,200
請等一下
Wait here,please.

344
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,200
血壓脈搏完全沒有改變
No blips,no blood pressure variations,no pulse variance.

345
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,400
我從來沒有見過這種現象
Either she's telling the truth, or I've never seen anyone like her.

346
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,480
我想這下該明白了
I guess that settles it.

347
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,710
-她在說謊. -她騙得過我，也騙不過機器
- She's lying. - Forget it. You can't fool the machine.

348
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,350
相信我，她辦得到
Trust me. It can be done.

349
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,220
你怎麼這麼清楚？
And what makes you such an expert?

350
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,760
因為我知道有人辦得到
Because I know people that have done it.

351
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,700
謝謝
Thank you.

352
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,700
謝謝你過來跑一趟. 很抱歉這麼麻煩你
Thanks for coming in,Miss Tramell. Sorry to inconvenience you.

353
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,540
誰能載我回家？
Could someone give me a ride home?

354
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,540
當然
Sure.

355
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,610
謝了
Thank you.

356
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,620
想喝一杯嗎？
Want to get a drink?

357
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,300
-好不容易捱過一天. -那倒不見的
- Rough day? - Not really.

358
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,630
騙過那台機器可不容易
Beating that machine can't be easy.

359
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,460
我有罪的話會用那台機器嗎？
If I was guilty and wanted to beat that machine,it wouldn't be hard.

360
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,400
其實並不難.一點都不難
It wouldn't be hard at all.

361
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,780
在你射殺兩人之後 也曾接受測謊測驗對不對？
You took a lie detector test after you shot those two people,didn't you?

362
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,650
我通過了
I passed.

363
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,550
你看吧，咱們兩人都是無辜的
You see? We're both innocent,Nick.

364
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,840
似乎你對我十分了解
You seem to know an awful lot about me.

365
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,580
你對我了解也不少
You know an awful lot about me.

366
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,650
我知道的都是工作上的事
I don't know anything that's not police business.

367
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,560
你知道我沒穿內衣. 對不對，尼克？
You know I don't wear any underwear. Don't you,Nick?

368
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,740
謝謝你載我一程
Thanks for the ride.

369
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,820
要再來杯酒嗎？
Would you like another glass of wine?

370
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,520
-嘿！尼克. -晚上好
- Hi,Nick. - Evening.

371
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,220
她那樣一直叫你是什麼意思？
What's all this "Nick" stuff?

372
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,730
尼克東尼克西的
"Nick,do you want a cigarette? Nick,can I have a ride?"

373
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,630
她沒叫我開車送她. 她問大家誰能送她
She didn't ask me to give her a ride. She asked anybody.

374
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,260
-但你自告奮勇. -尼克，喝點什麼？
- And you volunteered. - Hey,Nick. Evian?

375
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,670
給我雙份黑傑克加冰塊
No,Chuckie. Get me a double blackjack on the rocks,please.

376
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,510
你這是干嘛？
What you doing,Hoss?

377
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,510
我三個月沒沾一滴酒
I haven't had a drink in three months.

378
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,740
你覺得可以嗎？
All right with you,cowboy?

379
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,790
她不認識我可以了吧？
- She doesn't know me,okay? - Here you go.

380
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,850
我和加斯一起去找她的
I never seen her before Gus and I talked with her.

381
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,850
你確定嗎？
- Thanks,Chuck. - You're sure?

382
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,080
是的，十分確定
Yes,I'm sure.

383
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,090
干杯
Cheers.

384
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,830
現在怎麼辦？
Now what?

385
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,740
什麼怎麼辦，咱們玩完了
What "now what"? Now nothing.

386
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,810
她通過測謊機就是過關了
She passed the polygraph. That's it.

387
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,900
她知道如何通過測謊機 所以才願意一試
She knew how to beat it, that's why she took it.

388
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,380
你怎麼知道得這麼清楚？ 你到底和她有什麼牽扯？
How in the fuck do you know? What is it with you and this broad?

389
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,820
別讓她輕易溜掉了
Come on,Phil. Don't let this one slide.

390
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,380
她的父母和她其他的事
What about her parents? What about what else she published?

391
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,390
或許書中所說的都會實現
Maybe all her books come true.

392
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,480
她的父母死於意外. 我也不在乎她還寫了什麼事
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she published.

393
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,620
你想叫我作書評嗎？
What are you,a book critic?

394
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,820
他們怎麼死的？你們調查過嗎？
How'd they die? Was there an investigation?

395
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,400
你是說他先殺了自己父母， 然後殺了曼尼瓦斯卡？
You're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Manny Vasquez too?

396
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,630
難道她一上床就會突然變成一個殺人狂
Not unless she climbed into the ring and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

397
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,900
或許她學會用一招左鉤拳
Maybe she did. Maybe she grew herself an afro...

398
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,700
用鞋油塗在臉上假裝拳王
developed a hell of a left hook and put shoe polish all over her face.

399
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,410
-讓我們再替她測驗一次. -去你媽的
- Let's polygraph her again. - Fuck you.

400
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,780
也去你媽的
Fuck you too.

401
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,320
別擔心，尼克自己會去干
Don't worry,Phil. Nick'll fuck himself.

402
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,320
你們的笑話很好笑. 傑克，再給我一杯雙份的
You guys are very funny. Hey,Chuckie,get me another double.

403
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,750
嘿！開槍的
Hey,shooter!

404
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,730
你又酗酒了
Are you back on the blackjack,shooter?

405
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,490
-我們正在討論你的案子. -我知道，我也不懷疑
- We're discussing a case here. - I know that. I have no doubts.

406
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,400
尼克，你的酒
Here you go,Nick.

407
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,470
雙份的？
A double,huh,shooter?

408
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,570
我已經下班了
I'm off duty,Nilsen.

409
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,640
聽到了嗎？我下班了， 正在討論這件案子
You hear me? I'm off duty discussing a case.

410
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,380
你有什麼問題嗎？
Now,I.A. Shouldn't have a problem with that.

411
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,790
或許我該申請加班費
Maybe I should put in for some overtime?

412
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,420
工作別太賣力. 會使你酗酒
Don't work too hard,shooter. It might drive you to drink.

413
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,630
老子我爽，你閃一邊去！
Stop riding me,man! I'll kick your fucking teeth in!

414
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,430
-怎麼回事？ -沒什麼事，大夫
- What's the problem? - No problem,Doctor.

415
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,530
精神病醫生來了， 及時來解救她心愛的病人
Here comes the shrink,just in time to save her favorite patient.

416
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,870
滾一邊去，馬提！
Just fuck off,Marty!

417
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,550
你們今晚可以好好爽一下
You kids have a good time tonight,huh?

418
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,090
-他自找的. -沒錯！別上他的當
- He's asking for it. - That's right,so don't take the bait.

419
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,130
想走嗎？
Do you want to go?

420
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,530
-是的. -我們走
- Yes. - Let's go.

421
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,570
有時候我覺的他勾上她 只是為了擺脫風紀組
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get Internal Affairs off him.

422
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,700
那倒不盡然. 他是認真的
He ain't that way. He's got a heart.

423
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,110
她人怎麼樣？
What was she like?

424
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,680
-誰？ -凱瑟琳楚梅
- Who? - Catherine Tramell.

425
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,710
確定是她. 但她的書提供了藉口
You had her pegged. She used her book as an alibi.

426
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,120
我在柏克萊見過她
I met her at Berkeley.

427
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,120
我們同樣選修某些課程
We were in some of the same classes.

428
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,790
你為何不早告訴我？
Why didn't you tell me?

429
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,840
我現在告訴你了
I'm telling you.

430
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,350
你從未這個樣子，為什麼？
You've never been like that before. Why?

431
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,350
你說呢，你是心理醫生
You tell me. You're the shrink.

432
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,320
-你不是在跟我作愛. -那我是在跟誰作愛？
- You weren't making love to me. - Who was I making love to?

433
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,760
你根本不是在作愛
You weren't making love.

434
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,730
我想抽支煙
I need a cigarette.

435
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,200
你說你已經戒了
I thought you said you quit.

436
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,110
在最上層抽屜裡
It's the top drawer in the foyer.

437
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,110
出去時順便帶著！
Get it on your way out!

438
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,680
-開始了嗎？ -在等你
- Have you started? - Waitin' on you.

439
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,090
-你看起來糟透了. -不是，他剛作過心理分析
- You look like dog shit. - No,he looks a little shrunk is all.

440
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,600
不光是腦袋
And not just in the head.

441
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,260
我打電話和柏克萊聯絡
All right,I made a couple of calls to Berkeley.

442
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,890
八九年有位教授曾被謀殺
There was a murder in '80. A professor.

443
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,230
在床上被刺的渾身是洞， 冰錐刺的
In his bed,multiple stab wounds, with an ice pick.

444
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,410
當時楚梅在學校
Tramell was there then, wasn't she?

445
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:29,080
學校記錄說是的
University records say she was.

446
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,780
好吧！咱們開始進行. 加斯，你去柏克萊
Okay,let's move on this. Gus,get out to Berkeley.

447
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,880
你去找她其他寫的書
Harrigan,find out what else she's published.

448
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,650
你拿她父母死亡檔案給我看
Andrews,get me that file on the parents' accident.

449
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,620
把貝絲心理分析資料拿一份來
Copy Beth on everything. I want psychological input.

450
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,100
-我呢？ -你已經有一份心理分析資料了
- What about me? - You're already getting input.

451
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,100
你去沖個冷水澡
You go soak your head in a tub of ice water.

452
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,400
你去追查她的行蹤
You see where she leads.

453
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,340
周末愉快
You have a good weekend.

454
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,880
你也是
You too.

455
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,480
小心開車
Drive carefully.

456
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,080
-我會的. -再見
- I will. - Bye-bye.

457
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,390
我會給你電話的
I'll call you.

458
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,470
你閒著沒別的事干 竟然來辦公室和電腦打手槍
Ain't you got nothing better to do than to jack off the damn machine?

459
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,370
你來干嘛？
What are you doing here,cowboy?

460
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,460
我也來和電腦打手槍
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.

461
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,240
一個心理學教授死亡
One dead psychology professor.

462
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,340
高斯丁博士. 你猜怎麼樣？
Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?

463
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,250
他是她的指導教授
He was her counselor.

464
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,510
她有嫌疑嗎？
Was she a suspect?

465
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,580
沒有，根本沒叫她問話
No,sir. They never even got a statement from her.

466
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,380
艾索達普金斯？
Hazel Dobkins?

467
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,260
認識她嗎？
Do you know her?

468
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,660
這麼多年都忘不掉
Couldn't get it out of my head for years.

469
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,460
三個孩子的賢妻良母
Nice little housewife. Three little kids.

470
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,300
有一個顧家的好丈夫， 也沒有財務問題
Nice husband wasn't porking around. No financial problems.

471
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:33,170
一個晴朗的日子裡 她把全家人都做了
One day,out of the clear blue sky, she does them,all of them.

472
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,300
拿了一把結婚禮物收到的刀
Used a knife she got for a wedding present.

473
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,580
事後也不否認. 笑得很甜美
Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey.

474
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,550
她也說不出原因
Said she didn't know why she'd done it.

475
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,300
吵到你了嗎？
- Hi. - Am I disturbing you?

476
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,390
沒有，請進
No,come on in.

477
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,400
咱們上樓去
Let's go upstairs.

478
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,520
我把你當作我書中的探長
I'm using you for my detective in my book.

479
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,620
不介意吧？
You don't mind,do you?

480
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,330
我正在調酒
I was just gonna make myself a drink.

481
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,430
-想喝一點嗎？ -不用，謝了
- Do you want one? - No,thanks.

482
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,440
你也戒酒了嗎？
Oh,right. You're off the Jack Daniels too,aren't you?

483
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,240
有幾個問題請教一下
I've got a few more questions to ask you.

484
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,440
我也正想問你. 為了我的書
I have some for you too. For my book.

485
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,420
你對冰塊很不滿嗎？
Do you have something against ice cubes?

486
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,460
我喜歡粗糙的稜角
I like rough edges.

487
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,500
你想問我什麼？
So,what did you want to ask me?

488
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,190
殺人的滋味如何？
How does it feel to kill someone?

489
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,330
你來告訴我
You tell me.

490
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,740
我不知道，你該知道
I don't know, but you do.

491
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,380
那是一次意外
It was an accident.

492
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,380
我的槍忽然走火
They got in the line of fire.

493
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,450
五年中的4次都是意外？
Four shootings in five years, all accidents?

494
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,330
他們都是毒販，我當時在臥底
They were drug buys. I was working undercover.

495
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,270
想談談高斯丁教授的事嗎？
You want to tell me about Professor Goldstein?

496
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,460
那是老掉牙的人物了
Well,there's a name from the past.

497
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,570
現代也有個艾索達普金斯
You want a name from the present? What about Hazel Dobkins?

498
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,380
高斯丁是我一年紀的指導教授
Noah Goldstein was my counselor my freshman year.

499
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,680
我的冰錐靈感大概就由此而來 在我書中
That's probably where I got the idea for the ice pick for my book.

500
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,220
潛意識的力量真是驚人
Funny how the subconscious works.

501
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,580
的確
Hilarious.

502
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,730
-艾索是我的朋友. -你的朋友把一家人全宰了
- Hazel's my friend. - Your friend took out her whole family.

503
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,890
她使我了解殺人的沖動
Yes,she helped me understand homicidal impulse.

504
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,100
你在學校就學到了
I thought you would have learned that at school.

505
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,640
只是理論上的
Only in theory.

506
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,910
你對殺人沖動了解十分透徹. 不是嗎，槍手？
But you know all about homicidal impulse,don't you,shooter?

507
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,910
不是理論，是實務的
Not in theory,in practice.

508
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,690
卷入其中的滋味如何？
What happened? Did you get sucked into it?

509
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,550
你無法自拔嗎？
Did you like it too much?

510
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,360
我不知道你在說什麼
I don't know what you're talking about.

511
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,700
談談可卡因吧，尼克
Tell me about the coke,Nick.

512
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,770
你殺了觀光客的那天…
The day you shot those two tourists...

513
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,810
你吸了多少可卡因？
how much coke did you do?

514
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,810
你可以告訴我
Come on,you can tell me.

515
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,550
-我吸了. -你吸了…
- I didn't. - Yes,you did.

516
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,890
他們沒替你檢驗
They never tested you,did they?

517
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,890
風紀組的人知道
Internal Affairs knew.

518
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,290
你老婆也知道，對不對？
Your wife knew too,didn't she?

519
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,800
她知道怎麼回事
She knew what was going on.

520
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,670
你離火焰太近了
I think you got too close to the flame.

521
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,650
我想你很喜歡
I think you liked it.

522
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,800
所以她才自殺
That's why she killed herself.

523
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,180
嗨，海倫
Hi,hon.

524
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,650
你們兩位見過面
You two have met,haven't you?

525
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,800
你會是位了不起的角色
You're gonna make a terrific character,Nick.

526
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,580
她正在打電話，馬上會叫你
She's on the phone. She'll be right with you.

527
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,140
-我馬上會打回去給你. -探長，你不能進去--
- I'm gonna have to call you back. - Detective,you can't go in...

528
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,720
-誰動過我的檔案？ -你在說什麼？
- Who's got access to my file? - What are you talking about?

529
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,880
誰動過我那些檔案？
Who has access to my goddamn file?

530
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,750
沒人動過. 那些是機密的個人心理資料
Nobody. It's a confidential psychiatric record. It would be illegal.

531
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,560
你干的，少對我扯謊言
Don't you fucking lie to me!

532
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,620
是風紀組動的
It was Internal Affairs,wasn't it?

533
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,720
不是的
No,please.

534
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,790
-是誰？ -是尼爾森
- Who? - It's Nilson.

535
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,380
有何貴干，柯倫？
What do you want,Curran?

536
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,680
你把我的檔案賣了
You sold her my file,didn't you?

537
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,840
你在說誰？
Who are you talking about?

538
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,520
凱瑟琳楚梅. 她付你多少？
Catherine Tramell. How much did she pay you?

539
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:25,120
快點住手
Hey,Curran,come on! Damn it,stop it!

540
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,520
多少錢？
How much?

541
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,460
快住手，柯倫！
Hey,back off! Back off,Curran!

542
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,590
輕松一點
Nice and easy now. Nice and easy.

543
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,610
去你媽的頭，你完蛋了
You fucked yourself,shooter. You hear me? You are out!

544
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,440
-柯倫，輕松點. -你死定了！
- Curran,take it easy. - You are out!

545
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,470
省省吧
Save it,save it.

546
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,180
-尼克，你沒事吧？ -我沒事
- What's going down,Hoss? - Nothing. I'll be okay.

547
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,510
-他們不會放過你的. -我痛恨被人耍著玩
- They're gonna want your badge. - I'm tired of being played with.

548
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,110
你表現的方式真是與眾不同
You got a real conclusive way of demonstrating that.

549
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,600
她把我摸的一清二楚
She knows where I live and breathe.

550
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,270
我被她盯上了，加斯
She's coming after me,Gus.

551
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,170
她和你有什麼瓜葛？
What is it you got between you?

552
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,640
-我不知道. -是有點不對
- I don't know. - Something,though.

553
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:22,770
是的，沒錯
Something.

554
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,520
TV:GeorgeJefferson is unfair. He's short with no hair.

555
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,840
尼克，你在裡面嗎？
Nick,are you there?

556
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:46,810
走開.貝絲，我不想見你
Go away,Beth. I don't want to see you.

557
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,840
我還有鑰匙
I still have my key.

558
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,590
放在桌上然後離開
Put them on the table and leave.

559
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,080
放在他媽的桌上快離開！
Put them on the goddamn table and leave!

560
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,160
媽的！別轟我出去. 你欠我的不只是這些
Damn it! Don't shove me out! You owe me more than that!

561
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,260
我什麼也不欠你！
I don't owe you anything!

562
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,130
你也不欠我什麼
And you don't owe me anything.

563
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,300
我們是有上床，大概十到十五次
We went to bed,what,10,15 times?

564
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:23,140
那可不是我的責任
It wasn't memorable enough to carry an obligation.

565
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,540
有時候我真的很恨你
Sometimes I really hate you.

566
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,550
你為何不替自己開些藥方…
Why don't you get yourself some friendly little therapist...

567
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,880
讓自己溫柔一點？
to work out some of that hostility?

568
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:36,180
或許能有些用處
And maybe you can get off once in a while.

569
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,750
你這神經病
Are you nuts?

570
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,340
對不起
I'm sorry.

571
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,200
我很少這個樣子
I don't usually act like that.

572
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,910
你怎麼把我的檔案流出去？
How could you give him my file?

573
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,620
我是被迫的！
I had to!

574
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,580
他打算將你從局裡除名
He was going to recommend your discharge from the force.

575
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,880
他也不接受我的評估 認為不夠客觀
He didn't buy my evaluation. He said I wasn't objective.

576
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,750
所以我拿那個和他作交換條件
So I made a deal with him to review the session notes himself.

577
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,260
我沒想到他會給別人看
I didn't think he'd show them to anybody.

578
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,160
-你是為了我？ -是的
- You did it for me? - Yes.

579
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,730
因為我關心你. 才為你這樣做
I care about you. I did it for you.

580
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:29,640
你走吧，拜托你快走
Go away. Please,just go away.

581
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,370
喂。
Yo.

582
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,210
我馬上趕去
I'm on my way.

583
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,800
一槍斃命，近距離射擊. 大概是點三八左輪
One shot. Close range. Probably a.38 caliber revolver.

584
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,700
你的槍給我，尼克
Give me your gun,Nick.

585
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,380
你以為--
You think that...

586
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:25,120
我不認為是你. 但我的意見是少數
I don't,Hoss. But I got the minority opinion.

587
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:34,130
是的，我討厭他！ 我一時失去控制
Okay,I went after him! I lost my temper.

588
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,230
你有證據他把你的心理檔案 給別人看嗎？
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?

589
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,150
等一下會找你談，嘉納大夫
We'll speak with you afterwards,Dr. Garner.

590
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:48,200
-我想參加，不介意吧. -我想你還是--
- I'd like to sit in. - I'd really rather wait...

591
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,180
我想有她在座應該無所謂， 柯倫探長不反對的話
It's all right if Dr. Garner sits in, if Detective Curran doesn't object.

592
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:01,080
-你昨晚人在何處？ -在家看電視
- Where were you last night? - Home,watching TV.

593
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,750
整晚都在？
All night?

594
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,160
是的，一整晚
Yes,all night.

595
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,430
在喝酒嗎？
Were you drinking?

596
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,760
是的，喝了一點
Yeah,I was drinking.

597
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,740
-你何時有開始喝的？ -幾天前
- When did you start drinking again? - A couple of days ago.

598
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,280
大約昨晚十點左右 我看見他在家裡
I saw Detective Curran at his apartment about 10:00 last night.

599
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,250
他當時神智清醒
He was sober and lucid.

600
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,840
我問他對尼爾森警官的感受
I asked him,in my capacity as his departmental therapist...

601
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,180
我問他對尼爾森警官的感受
about his altercation with Lieutenant Nilsen.

602
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,420
他深表悔意
He expressed regret and displayed no hostility.

603
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,430
-你在他公寓待了多久？ -大約十五分鍾
- How long were you at his apartment? - About 15 minutes.

604
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,830
直到我放心了才離去
I saw there was no reason for my concern and left.

605
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,560
這裡不能吸煙的
There's no smoking in this building,Detective.

606
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,570
你想告我吸煙嗎？
What are you gonna do? Charge me with smoking?

607
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:49,170
天哪--尼克，我再問你一次就夠了
Oh,for Christ's... All right,Nick, I'm gonna ask you this just once.

608
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,470
為了記錄，你是否殺了尼爾森？
For the record, did you kill Marty Nilsen?

609
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,410
沒有
No.

610
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,180
我不會當著大家的面先詛咒他…
I'm gonna storm into his office in front of everybody...

611
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,220
然後當晚把他宰了
in the middle of the day and kill him that night?

612
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,280
我沒那麼笨
I'm not that dumb.

613
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,260
你先離去 再回頭殺他正好可脫罪. 那是你的不在場證明
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him. That's your alibi.

614
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:10,790
你也是看書學來的這一套
Like writing a book about killing a guy gets you off the hook for killing him.

615
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,870
說的好
Good point.

616
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,830
我不懂你在說什麼書
What are you talking about?

617
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,430
-這是我們自己的笑話，混賬. -我不覺得好笑
- A private joke,asshole. - I don't think it's funny.

618
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,840
你的職務暫時被吊銷…
You're going on leave...

619
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:23,340
繼續進行心理狀態評估
pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation.

620
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:37,860
貝絲，我馬上回來拿行李
I'll get my stuff in a minute.

621
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,560
謝謝你
Thank you.

622
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,290
我至少能幫上這個忙
It's the least I could do.

623
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,200
是我害你來問話的
Considering I got you into this mess with those reports.

624
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:55,830
我是說真的，謝謝
No,I mean it. Thank you.

625
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:00,580
你怎知道凱瑟琳看過你的檔案？
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw your file?

626
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:04,440
她知道一些事， 我只告訴過你
She knows things about me that I only told you.

627
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,110
一定有什麼不對
She must really be something.

628
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,450
從治療的觀點來看
From a clinical point of view.

629
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,390
-她在學校表現如何？ -我跟她不熟
- What was she like in school? - I hardly knew her.

630
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,160
她讓我有些毛骨悚然
She gave me the creeps.

631
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,160
不知道為什麼
I don't know why.

632
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:23,330
休息一下.答應我
Get some rest. Promise?

633
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,340
-我昨天說的那些話不是認真的-- -你是的
- I didn't mean what I said about... - Yes,you did.

634
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:35,380
我不是小孩子，我會處理的
I'm a big girl. I can handle it.

635
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:02,370
-你自己多保重. -你對她父母的調查怎樣？
- You take care of yourself. - What'd you find out about the parents?

636
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,340
別提了
No lead,man.

637
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,510
你簡直是神經病
You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible wacko!

638
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:11,520
你知道我神經病，到底怎樣？
You know I'm wacko. What'd you find out?

639
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,660
游艇爆炸. 燃料箱漏洞
The boat blew. There was a leak in the fuel line.

640
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:22,660
曾經修理過兩次 兩人投了高額的保險
There were two previous repairs and a five mil policy on both of them.

641
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,260
曾經積極的調查都沒結果
A real heavy investigation but they got zilch.

642
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,100
賠了一大筆錢，說是意外
Big goose egg. It was an "accident."

643
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,500
風紀組還要找你問話. 由他們調查，我們不插手
I.A.'s gonna talk to you about Nilsen. They're handling the investigation.

644
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:34,340
你和嘉納大夫保持聯絡. 對你的評估有幫助
Stay in touch with Dr. Garner. It'll help on the evaluation.

645
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:37,710
是她干的
She killed him.

646
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:39,410
你說貝絲殺人？
Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?

647
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,480
是凱瑟琳殺的
Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game.

648
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:45,580
你先說她偷了你的檔案， 現在又說她殺了尼爾森？
First you got her stealing your file, now she's killing Nilsen?

649
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,550
少來這一套，看在老天的份上. 找個地方曬曬太陽
Forget about her! Go somewhere,sit in the sun.

650
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,250
-讓你神智清醒一下！ -你不相信嗎？
- Get her the hell out of your system! - You don't buy it,do you?

651
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,450
她知道沒人會相信
She knew nobody'd buy it.

652
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,090
她知道沒人相信我說的話
She knew I'd say she did it and nobody'd buy it!

653
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,400
她把你搞得神經錯亂！ 離她遠一點！
She is screwing with your head! Stay away from her!

654
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,390
那件事我聽說了
I heard what happened.

655
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:42,130
你沒帶槍看來更帥
What good's a shooter without his gun?

656
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,210
-你到底發現了什麼？ -我有律師
- How exactly did you find out? - I have attorneys.

657
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:48,280
一些好朋友
They have friends. I have friends.

658
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,710
我請了一大堆律師當朋友
Money buys a lot of attorneys and friends.

659
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:53,250
我沒辦法，我一文不名…
I wouldn't know about that. I don't have any money...

660
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,760
沒錢請律師朋友， 加斯是唯一的朋友
I don't have any attorneys, and Gus is my only real friend.

661
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,250
我們說的是真正的朋友
I wasn't talking about real friends.

662
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,120
加斯干嘛不喜歡我？
Why doesn't Gus like me?

663
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,760
我喜歡你
I like you.

664
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,500
-真的嗎？ -是的
- You do? - Yes.

665
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:15,770
想上樓喝兩杯嗎？
You want to go upstairs and have a drink?

666
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,800
我以為你不會請我
I didn't think you'd ask me.

667
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,780
你倒真有自知之明
I guess you don't know your character that well.

668
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,640
或許，可我學的很快
Maybe,but I'm learning.

669
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,520
很快我就會比你更了解你自己
Pretty soon I'll know you better than you know yourself.

670
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:31,720
-別太過自信. -為什麼不行？
- Don't be so sure. - Why not?

671
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,520
-我非常難以捉摸. -難以捉摸？
- I'm very unpredictable. - Unpredictable?

672
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,730
你該加一點暖色調
You should put some warmth into the place.

673
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,500
你不想反映出自己性格
You don't want it to reflect your personality.

674
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,370
我不喜歡愚弄別人
I'm not trying to fool anybody.

675
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,240
還是喝傑克丹尼爾？
Jack Daniels all right? It's going to have to be.

676
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:56,250
-加冰塊？ -好的
- Ice? - Great.

677
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,720
我在等著你來
I was expecting you.

678
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,430
超市買的，一塊六毛五
K-Mart. A buck,sixty-five.

679
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,800
讓我來好了
Why don't you let me do this for you.

680
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,210
你喜歡看著我做，對不對？
You like watching me do it, don't you?

681
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,590
能不能給我一根煙？
Could I have a cigarette too,please?

682
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,290
我說過你戒煙戒不久
I told you you'd start smoking again.

683
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:42,330
替我點個火
Would you light it for me?

684
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,270
謝了
Thanks.

685
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:55,540
你花了多少錢向尼爾森買檔案？
So how much did you pay Nilsen for my file?

686
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:00,340
是那個被你干掉的警察嗎，槍手？
Isn't he the policeman that you shot,shooter?

687
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,440
別叫我槍手
What if I ask you not to call me "shooter"?

688
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:06,380
好的，叫你尼基如何？
Okay. How about if I call you Nicky?

689
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:10,460
我老婆都是這樣叫我
My wife used to call me Nicky.

690
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,860
我知道.我喜歡
Yeah,I know. I like it.

691
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,300
干杯，朋友都叫我凱瑟琳
Cheers. My friend call me Catherine.

692
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,890
曼尼怎樣叫你？
What did Manny Vasquez call you?

693
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,760
大部分都叫婊子
Bitch,mostly.

694
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,330
但他那樣叫代表親熱
But he meant it affectionately.

695
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,840
你有可卡因嗎？
Do you have any coke?

696
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:35,350
我喜歡可卡因配上傑克丹尼爾
I just love coke with Jack Daniels.

697
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,380
冰箱裡有百事可樂
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

698
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,690
這兩種東西不大一樣吧？
It's not really the same thing now, is it?

699
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,490
是不一樣
No,it's not.

700
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,430
這是干嘛？
So where's this going?

701
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,000
你到底想拿我怎麼樣？
What do you want from me?

702
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:59,200
你該說，“你到底想拿我怎麼樣， 凱瑟琳？”
Say,"what do you want from me, Catherine?"

703
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:05,140
你他媽的想拿我怎麼樣，凱瑟琳？
What the fuck do you want from me,Catherine?

704
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,150
帶樣東西給你
Brought you something.

705
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:23,270
不說聲謝謝嗎？
Aren't you going to say thank-you?

706
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:26,830
-內容怎麼樣？ -敘述一個殺害雙親的男孩
- What's it about? - It's about a boy who kills his parents.

707
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,930
然後布置的象是件意外
They have a play, and he makes it look like an accident.

708
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,140
干嘛那樣做？
Why did he do that?

709
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:38,880
看看是否有辦法脫罪
To see if he could get away with it.

710
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,080
你何時寫的？
When did you write this?

711
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,020
你是指是否在我父母死前寫的？
You mean, did I write it before my parents died?

712
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:54,930
我過了好幾年才寫的
No. I wrote it years afterwards.

713
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:00,170
你不會因為現在被吊銷職務 就停止跟蹤我吧？
You wont stop following me around now just because you're on leave?

714
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,860
絕對不會
Absolutely not.

715
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,300
很好，我會想念你
Good,I'd miss you.

716
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:07,910
你會惹上麻煩，你不再算警察
You could get in trouble. You're not really a cop anymore.

717
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:10,910
-我寧願冒險. -干嘛冒險？
- I'll risk it. - Why take the risk?

718
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,980
看看我是否能脫罪
To see if I can get away with it.

719
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,880
-你的新書怎樣？ -故事正在進行當中
- How's your new book? - Practically writing itself.

720
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:24,190
我大概午夜時會離開， 如果你想跟蹤我的話
I'll be leaving about midnight, in case you are going to follow me.

721
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,790
-我會去巴茲的俱樂部. -到時候見
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club. - I'll meet you there.

722
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,000
嗨，加斯
Hi,Gus.

723
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:53,250
原諒我請問一下， 我不想多費唇舌…
Forgive me for asking,and I don't mean to belabor the obvious...

724
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,320
她為什麼讓你魂不守捨？
but why've you got your head so far up your ass?

725
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,860
她想玩，我就陪她玩
She wants to play. Fine,I can play.

726
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:04,630
和她玩的人都死光了
Everybody she plays with dies.

727
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:08,100
我知道那種滋味
I know what that's like.

728
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:39,980
你再跟著他，我就宰了你
If you don't leave her alone, I'll kill you.

729
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:48,350
我問你一件事，"洛茜"
Let me ask you something,"Rocky."

730
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,720
男人對男人
Man to man.

731
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,800
我認為她是世界第一作愛高手
I think she's the fuck of the century.

732
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,710
你認為呢？
What do you think?

733
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,770
你來多久了？
How long you been here?

734
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:13,050
你喜歡在旁邊偷看，對不對？
You like watching, don't you?

735
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,720
她喜歡我看她
She likes me to watch.

736
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:12,170
（海灘上）
"The beach C"

737
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:57,050
早上好
Good morning.

738
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:00,710
洛茜好象不太高興
I guess Roxy's not taking this too well.

739
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,790
她看過我和很多人作愛
She's seen me fuck plenty of guys.

740
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,630
或許她看到些沒看過的事
Well,maybe she saw something she's never seen before.

741
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,200
她什麼事都見過
She's seen everything before.

742
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,870
我認為我什麼都見識過了
Honey,I thought I'd seen everything before.

743
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,770
你真認為自己與眾不同？
Did you really think it was so special?

744
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:21,100
我說你是世界第一做愛高手
I told her I thought it was the fuck of the century.

745
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,910
你覺得呢？
What do you think?

746
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:31,950
我認為這是個很好的開始
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

747
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:37,150
洛茜呢？
What about Roxy?

748
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,720
她更有趣嗎？
Is she more fun?

749
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,700
要不要叫他改天一起參加？
Would you like her to join us sometime?

750
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:47,600
-她有參加你和強尼作愛嗎？ -沒有，強尼覺得她太具威脅性
- Did she join you and Johnny? - No,he felt intimidated.

751
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,730
看看他的下場
Look what happened to him.

752
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,710
你昨晚被嚇到了嗎？
Tell me, were you frightened last night?

753
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,110
那才是重點嗎？
That's the point, wasn't it?

754
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,170
那正是好玩的地方
That's what made it so good.

755
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:01,740
-你不該玩這種游戲. -為什麼？我很喜歡
- You shouldn't play this game. - Why not? I like it.

756
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:02,980
你玩的太過火了
You're in over your head.

757
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:06,990
或許吧， 但這是我抓凶手的辦法
Maybe,but this is how I'll catch my killer.

758
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:16,900
我不會在高潮的時候 供出一切秘密的
I'm not going to confess all my secrets just because I have an orgasm.

759
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:19,160
我想隱瞞的事你不會知道
You won't learn anything I don't want you to know.

760
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:23,900
我會知道的. 我會逮到你
Yes,I will. Then I'll nail you.

761
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:27,100
不會的，你愛上我了
You'll just fall in love with me.

762
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:29,200
我已經愛上你了
I'm in love with you already.

763
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:35,610
但我還是會逮到你
But I'll nail you anyway.

764
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,980
你可以寫進書裡
You can put that in your book.

765
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:43,800
{\i1}# No #{\r}

766
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,790
{\i1}# Not that bar again #{\r}

767
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,640
{\i1}# Oh,I want to know you're the one #{\r}

768
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,970
{\i1}# And I don't mean the one I regret #{\r}

769
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,320
{\i1}# The heart's still going #{\r}

770
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,170
-我就知道你在這裡. -你死到哪裡去了？
- Thought I'd find you here. - Where the fuck you been?

771
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,980
-我到處找你. -別急，小子
- I've been over to your place. - Easy,cowboy,easy.

772
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:13,050
-我不在家. -我昨天晚上也去找過你
- I wasn't there. - I went over last night too.

773
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,320
那時我也不在
Well,I wasn't there either.

774
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,830
你操了她
You fucked her.

775
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:27,930
天殺的王八蛋
God damned,dumb son of a bitch!

776
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,030
你操了她！
You fucked her!

777
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,170
你真他媽的王八蛋！
God damn! You are one...

778
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,270
你真他媽的王八蛋！
dumb son of a bitch!

779
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:35,900
我下次會戴保險套
Next time,I'll use a rubber.

780
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:40,350
我才不管你用什麼！
I don't give a flying,chili bean fart about that!

781
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:43,310
-多少錢？ -三十二塊
- How about it,Harry. How much? - Thirty-two.

782
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,050
我在擔心他，他在擔心保險套
I'm worried about him, he's worried about rubbers.

783
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,020
你必須保護自己
You really gotta protect yourself.

784
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:50,860
有什麼必要？
What in the hell for?

785
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:56,190
你想我有機會嗎？ 我也能找到一些馬子上床！
You think I'm getting any? Sure,I can get laid by blue haired women!

786
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:59,900
-但我不喜歡！ -你試過才知道！
- I don't like them! - Don't knock it 'til you tried it!

787
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:07,200
好一點了嗎？
Feeling better?

788
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,140
很好
I feel fine.

789
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,710
你怎麼能跟她上床？
How could you fuck her?

790
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,680
拜托一下
Come on.

791
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:20,720
你活的不耐煩了？
You want to die,Hoss?

792
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,790
是因為那些觀光客的意外？
What is it? Those tourists?

793
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:28,330
你仍然為那件事感到抱歉？
You still so bad about that,you're wiggling your way into an ice pick?

794
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,930
干脆投向一根冰錐？ 這裡的觀光客太多了
Got too many,god damn tourists coming here anyway!

795
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,770
-別這樣. -觀光客多得是，來自世界各地！
- Hold it down. - Plenty more where they came from!

796
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,040
我不會怕她
I'm not afraid of her.

797
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:48,550
干嘛不怕？
Why the hell not?

798
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,190
我不知道
I don't know.

799
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,720
就是不怕
I'm just not.

800
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,090
都是她的BB害你神魂顛倒！
That's her pussy talking! It ain't your brain!

801
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,720
拜托好不好
Come on.

802
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:12,170
風紀組去追查尼爾森身前的物品
I.A. Did a track on Lieutenant Martin D-for-dickhead Nilsen.

803
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,770
發現一個保險箱裝了五萬美金…
They found a safety deposit box with $50,000 in it...

804
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,840
三個月前領出來尚未花用
taken out three months ago and not used since.

805
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,810
這樣沒道理. 三個月前她還不認識我
That doesn't make any sense. She didn't know me three months ago.

806
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,580
或許不是她付的錢
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.

807
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:28,290
或許這錢有別的用途，天知道
Maybe the money was for something else. How the fuck do I know?

808
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,860
我現在是泥菩薩過江自身難保
I'm just an old city cowboy trying not to fall out of his saddle.

809
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:53,820
-你沒事吧？ -沒事
- All right,cowboy? - Yeah.

810
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,820
來吧！載你回家
Come on. I'm going to drive you home.

811
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:58,050
坐你那部爛車？
In that little piss-ant car of yours?

812
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:02,220
不必了. 我不想退休時患上背痛
Hell,no. I ain't getting no back pain disability retirement.

813
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:07,360
我想得到全額退休金 加上一付鍍金的精工表
I'm gonna get a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

814
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,930
快點，我載你回家--
I'm driving you...

815
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,230
我才不讓你這混小子 開我的凱迪拉克！
You're not driving my Cadillac car!

816
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:16,140
我才不讓你這混小子 開我的凱迪拉克！
I won't let no head-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car!

817
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,570
再見了
So long!

818
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,360
你喜歡玩就上啊！
You wanna play? Come on!

819
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:32,190
組長！有情報了
Lieutenant! I got the information.

820
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,200
快下來說！
Get it down here!

821
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:36,800
這是你的自白書嗎？
You signed your name to this crock of shit?

822
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,200
這本來就是意外
Why not? It was an accident.

823
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:42,300
"你在這附近開車閒逛 碰上這輛車閃躲不及."
"Your driving around North Beach and this car won't get out of the way."

824
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,210
我不認為她想自殺
I don't think she meant to go off the edge.

825
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,010
-插嘴一下. -閃一邊去！
- Could we have him for a minute? - No,you can't!

826
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:51,020
別跟我扯爛污. 我可以叫你吃不完兜著走
Don't fuck with me on this. I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

827
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,350
全名是洛珊哈迪. 上一個地址是加州克勞弗
Full name is Roxanne Hardy. Last known address,Cloverdale,California.

828
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,550
完全沒有前科
No priors, no convictions.

829
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:59,750
車子登記在凱瑟琳楚梅名下
Car is registered to Catherine Trammel.

830
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:01,800
-你認識她！對不對？ -我在楚梅家見過她
- You knew her! - I met her at Trammel's house.

831
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,560
記下她的名字
All I did was write her name down.

832
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:06,690
你記下她的名字…
You wrote her name down and then big surprise...

833
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,260
然後她開車滑下山坡 死在了你面前
she rolls her car down a hill and dies.

834
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:13,140
-你是這個意思嗎？ -我所知僅有這些
- Is that what you're telling me? - That's all I know.

835
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:16,340
你想知道嗎，去你媽的
You know what then? Fuck you!

836
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,310
-我想你去嘉納大夫的辦公室-- -我叫你離楚梅遠一點！
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office... - I told you to stay away from Trammel!

837
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:23,020
你沒叫我離她的車子遠一點！
You didn't tell me to stay away from the car!

838
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,610
-我想你九點去嘉納大夫的辦公室. -你們這次要把我檔案賣給誰？
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office! - Who are you selling my file to now?

839
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:32,360
你發神經了，柯倫. 你聽到沒？
You are out of control,Curran. You hear me?

840
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:44,640
你好，尼克. 這是麥倫大夫…
Hello,Nick. This is Dr. Myron...

841
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:46,640
麥克溫大夫
and Dr. McElwaine.

842
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:52,850
他們是被請來一起和我 替你做精神狀態評估
They've been asked to consult with me on this psychiatric evaluation.

843
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,810
請坐
Sit down.

844
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,590
據說你最近常常難以控制脾氣
We understand you're having difficulty controlling your temper lately.

845
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:08,190
都是關於某一個人
Only in regard to one person.

846
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:13,070
你認為尼爾森死有余辜嗎？
Do you think Lieutenant Nilsen deserved to die?

847
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,200
我根本不太了解他
I didn't know him well enough.

848
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:17,700
我也不會想念他
I won't miss him.

849
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:23,140
當你想起你的童年…
When you recollect your childhood...

850
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:25,810
那些回憶令你愉快嗎？
are your recollections pleasing to you?

851
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:33,220
第一點: 這不知被挑起多少遍了，但的確很多次
Number one: I don't remember how often I jerked off,but it was a lot.

852
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:35,720
第二點: 我不生我老爸的氣…
Number two: I wasn't pissed off at my dad...

853
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:38,730
就算我知道他和媽在房間干好事
even when I was old enough to know what he and mom did in the bedroom.

854
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,820
第三點: 我沖馬桶時不會多看
Number three: I don't look in the toilet before I flush.

855
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:45,270
第四點: 我已很久沒尿床
Number four: I haven't wet my bed for a long time.

856
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:47,670
第五點…
Number five...

857
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:49,860
你們兩個死一邊去
why don't the two of you go fuck yourselves.

858
01:29:50,110 --> 01:29:51,870
我要走了
I'm out of here.

859
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,370
你到底是怎麼回事？ 我一直想辦法幫你
What's your problem? I'm trying to help.

860
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,250
-你為什麼就不能合作點？ -我不要你幫忙！
- Why won't you let me? - I don't want your help!

861
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:05,150
-我不需要. -你需要！
- I don't need it. - Yes,you do!

862
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,280
事態不妙
Something's going on.

863
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,350
你和她上床對不對？
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

864
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:13,560
-你對她干嘛這麼有興趣？ -我的興趣是你，不是她
- Why are you interested in her? - My interest is in you,not her.

865
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,590
她會利用別人，操縱別人
She seduces and manipulates people.

866
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:18,130
-她會想盡一切辦法-- -我以為你跟她不熟
- She'll do anything she can... - I thought you hardly knew her?

867
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,730
-我是心理醫生，我知道這種人. -什麼意思…
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist. - That means...

868
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,360
你也一樣會操縱別人！
you manipulate people too!

869
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,700
你是職業的心理醫生
You're a practicing psychologist.

870
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:27,900
你比她還高明！
You're better at it than she is!

871
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:32,650
我替你遺憾，尼克！
I feel sorry for you!

872
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:31,860
我早該料到
I should have known.

873
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:38,710
我當時在屋裡
I came in to the house.

874
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:40,680
然後我們到海灘上…
When we were down on the beach...

875
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:44,810
她用詭異的眼光看著我
she looked at me so strangely.

876
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,750
你走之後，她就離開了
She left right after you.

877
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:56,230
我--
I...

878
01:31:57,330 --> 01:32:00,560
我不該讓她看見我們
I shouldn't have let her watch us.

879
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:04,970
她一向喜歡看著我做愛
She wanted to watch me all the time.

880
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:15,710
她試圖殺你，對不對？
She tried to kill you, didn't she?

881
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:20,020
-你喜歡她看你嗎？ -你以為我叫她去殺你嗎？
- Did you like her to watch you? - You think I told her to kill you?

882
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:22,020
不是
No.

883
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:28,900
我關心的所有人...
Everybody that I care about...

884
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,900
都死了
dies.

885
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,590
跟我做愛
Make love to me.

886
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:15,910
你覺得強尼是她殺的嗎？
You think she killed Johnny Boz?

887
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:19,040
為什麼？陷害我嗎？
For what, to set me up?

888
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,640
她愛我，她不會害我
She loved me. She wouldn't frame me.

889
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,750
-或許她也嫉妒強尼. -不會
- Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too. - No,she didn't.

890
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,850
她從前從來不會嫉妒
She'd never get jealous before.

891
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,890
她只會感到興奮
She got excited.

892
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,900
我沒有女人緣
I don't have luck with women.

893
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,760
有一個女孩
There was this girl...

894
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,330
我在大學時認識的
I met when I was in college.

895
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:45,940
我和她上過一次床
I slept with her once.

896
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:50,740
她開始纏著我不放， 偷拍我
She started following me around, taking my picture.

897
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:55,010
她染了頭發， 模仿我穿衣服
She dyed her hair, copied my clothes.

898
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,020
好象叫麗莎…
Lisa...

899
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,020
歐伯曼的
something,Oberman.

900
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:06,090
真恐怖
It was awful.

901
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:10,090
我以為你不會這麼坦白
I thought you didn't make confessions.

902
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:16,660
我從前不會
I never did before.

903
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,040
又一個漂亮女孩
Another nice girl.

904
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,660
事發時她多大？
How old was she when it happened?

905
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:50,740
十六歲
Sixteen.

906
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,140
她少年時記錄被封查起來
We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.

907
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:55,140
所以你在電腦上查不到
That's why you couldn't find it in your computer.

908
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:57,980
動機是什麼？
What was the motive?

909
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,010
她說她不知道. 只憑一股沖動
She said she didn't know. Just sort of did it on impulse.

910
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:05,010
剃刀正好放在那裡. 她是這樣說的
The razor just happened to be there. That's what she said.

911
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:14,700
-想喝咖啡自己來. -謝了
- Help yourself to some coffee. - Thanks.

912
01:35:14,730 --> 01:35:17,670
我這下真的搞糊塗了
I don't understand what the hell is going on here.

913
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:19,960
沒那麼困難. 這個純樸的農家女孩…
It ain't hard,Hoss. This young farm girl...

914
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:23,560
認為大家都偏愛她的弟弟們…
got tired of all that attention going to her little brothers...

915
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,770
干脆把他們做了
so she fixed them.

916
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,810
就如艾索把一家子全做了
Just like old Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family.

917
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,680
只是小洛茜當時沒結婚禮物
Except young Roxy,here, didn't use a wedding present.

918
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:34,150
她用老爸的剃刀
She used daddy's razor.

919
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,990
你現在明白她們坐在營火前…
Sure makes you wonder what they talk about...

920
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:48,050
都在聊些什麼
when they sit in front of the campfire at night.

921
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,690
你認識他那幾個無辜的朋友
You ever met a friend of hers that hasn't killed somebody?

922
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:54,740
你以為天下女孩都一樣
Must of beat your ordinary, every day girl talk.

923
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,140
我不大確認是她干的
I'm not sure,anymore,she did it.

924
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,570
你到底在說誰？
Which one we talking about now?

925
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:02,740
我們知道是艾索干的， 小洛茜也干過
We know Hazel did it. We know young Roxy did it.

926
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:04,070
另一個呢--
And the other one...

927
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:09,640
她的BB欲火難消， 把你的腦袋都烤焦了
She's got that magna cum laude pussy that fried up your brain.

928
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,140
"歐伯曼…馬克…唐納."
"Oberman,Mark W., Donald M."

929
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:33,800
抱歉，沒有"麗莎"
Sorry,no "Lisa."

930
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,640
你肯定嗎？
You sure about the year?

931
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:39,680
楚梅是八三年畢業的
Catherine Tramell graduated in '83.

932
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,580
她說麗莎也是同一年
She said Lisa Oberman was here at the same time.

933
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,780
沒錯，有楚梅
Yeah,we have Tramell.

934
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:52,850
沒有麗莎歐伯曼
But no Lisa Oberman.

935
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,260
你確定沒搞錯嗎？
Are you sure? There can't be a mistake?

936
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:59,660
除非是你搞錯了
Only if you're making it,Detective.

937
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,780
艾索，這是我說過的尼克
Hazel,this is Nick. I told you all about him.

938
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:18,880
這是艾索達普金斯
Nick,this is Hazel Dobkins.

939
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:21,050
你就是那個開槍的
You're the shooter, aren't you?

940
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,090
幸會
How are you?

941
01:37:23,190 --> 01:37:25,890
謝謝，可以談一下嗎？
Fine,thank you. Can I speak to you for a minute?

942
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,660
-甜心，你去車裡等我. -我馬上過去
Honey，Would you wait for me in the car? I'll be right there.

943
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:33,670
再見，槍手
Good-bye,shooter.

944
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,870
你喜歡和凶手鬼混
You like to hang out with murderers,or what?

945
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:41,030
-你知道洛茜是-- -我當然知道
- You know that Roxy was involved... - Yes,of course,I knew.

946
01:37:41,110 --> 01:37:44,010
我寫的都是不尋常的人…
I write about unusual people, and sometimes when I do my research...

947
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,640
有時候為了研究他們必須如此
I get involved with them.

948
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:48,980
你的情形也一樣
It happened with you.

949
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:53,020
殺人和抽煙不一樣
Killing isn't like smoking.

950
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:55,320
可以戒掉
You can quit.

951
01:37:57,790 --> 01:38:00,020
我得走了
I gotta go.

952
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,290
我保證六點前一定會回家
I promised I'd get her home by 6:00.

953
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:06,100
她太喜歡“美國頭號通緝犯”
She just loves "America's Most Wanted."

954
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:09,870
你在柏克萊時 根本沒麗莎這個人
There was no Lisa Oberman when you were at Berkeley.

955
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:13,140
你在調查我嗎？
What are you doing? Checking up on me?

956
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:16,270
什麼意思？ 我說的是"何伯曼"
For what? I said "Hoberman."

957
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:23,050
"何伯曼". 麗莎何伯曼.開頭是"H"
"Hoberman." Lisa Hoberman,with an H.

958
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,690
有嗎？
You do?

959
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:31,250
好的，多謝
All right. Thank you very much.

960
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:37,100
要是讓別人知道准被炒魷魚
You know I can get my butt kicked for this.

961
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,690
你不該進來的
- You're not even supposed to be here.

962
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:42,130
山姆，一下就好了. - 才怪
- Come on,Sam.- This is only gonna take a minute. - Yeah.

963
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,910
調出來
Bring it up.

964
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:57,950
這不是嘉納大夫嗎？
That's Dr. Garner,isn't it?

965
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:03,760
調八三年的資料. - 收到
Bring up '83. - Come on.

966
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,740
你不該把門開著
You shouldn't leave your door open.

967
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:26,340
我沒有，鎖有點問題
I didn't. There's something wrong with my lock.

968
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:27,980
有何貴干？
What do you want?

969
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:29,210
告訴我凱瑟琳的事
Tell me about Catherine.

970
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,780
她告訴你了，對不對？
She told you, didn't she?

971
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:37,790
她告訴我什麼了？
What did she tell me?

972
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:43,060
我在學校和她上過一次
I slept with her once in school.

973
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:46,360
只是為了好玩. 是為了做實驗
I was just a kid. I was experimenting.

974
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,940
就那麼一次
It was just that one time.

975
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:52,810
她開始迷戀我
She developed a fixation on me.

976
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,940
把頭發染成我的顏色 和我穿同樣的衣服
She styled her hair like mine, wore the same kind of clothes as I did.

977
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:58,010
把我嚇到了
It scared me.

978
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,920
她是這樣告訴你的？
Isn't that what she told you?

979
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:06,350
她說是你
She said it was you.

980
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,590
你穿成和她一樣 頭發染成金色--
You dressed like her. You dyed your hair blonde...

981
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:10,850
我是染了頭發，那和她無關
I did dye my hair. It had nothing to do with her.

982
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,220
我有一段時間也染了紅發。- 你認識高斯丁嗎？
- I was a redhead for a while too.- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

983
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,760
- 我選了他的兩門課 - 你看到所有的報告
- I had him for two classes. - You saw all the reports.

984
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:17,200
你什麼都知道 卻從來不說！
Phil copied you. You never said anything!

985
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:19,060
你要我說什麼？
What am I supposed to say?

986
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:22,570
"我不是同性戀， 但我操了你的疑犯？"
"I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect"?

987
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:29,210
我很不好意思. 我只和女人上床一次
I was embarrassed. It was the only time I'd been with a woman.

988
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:33,010
她根本是病態
She's really sick,you know.

989
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:34,910
你猜她干了什麼？
Do you know what she's doing?

990
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:38,150
她知道我在伯克萊認識高斯丁
She knows I went to Berkeley. She knows I knew Noah.

991
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,150
她替我編造這些故事
She makes up this story about me.

992
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:42,820
她騙你說有人迷戀她
She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with her.

993
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:44,890
她沒騙我 她根本不知道你是誰
She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't know who you are.

994
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:46,620
她只說是麗莎何伯曼
You told me about a Lisa Hoberman.

995
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:49,990
她知道你會找出來. 你是個能干的警察
She knows you'd find out who Lisa is. You're a good cop.

996
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:53,260
她不經意間說出來的？
She tell you casually?

997
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:55,570
看來似乎不是安排的？
Make it seem irrelevant?

998
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:59,130
她在床上告訴你的？
Did she tell you in bed?

999
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:04,870
我也會這樣做
That's what I'd do.

1000
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:09,210
你干嘛改名？
Why'd you change your name?

1001
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,280
我結婚了，他叫我貝絲
I got married. He called me "Beth."

1002
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:14,820
他在沙林納診所執業
He was on staff at the clinic in Salinas.

1003
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:17,120
沒待了多久
Didn't last long.

1004
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:23,130
尼克 你以為我會殺人嗎？
Do you really think that I could kill someone?

1005
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,060
我根本沒碰過強尼巴茲！
I never even met Johnny Boz!

1006
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:28,630
我又有什麼動機殺尼爾森？
And what about Nilsen? What motive would I have to kill him?

1007
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:31,600
把鎖修好
- You should get that lock fixed. - God...

1008
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:35,100
她是個魔鬼！ 她聰明絕頂！
She's evil! She's brilliant!

1009
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:02,600
嚇到你了？
Did I scare you?

1010
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,000
本想給你一個驚喜
I wanted to surprise you.

1011
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:08,040
-有什麼不對？ -我找到麗莎何伯曼了
- What's wrong? - I found Lisa Hoberman.

1012
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:10,080
是嗎？她現在怎樣
Oh,you did? What's she doing?

1013
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:16,180
你不打算告訴我
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.

1014
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:19,650
-我們到底在玩什麼游戲. -我也是在玩
- I thought we were done playing games. - I did too.

1015
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,580
她說你纏著她不放
She said you got it backwards.

1016
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:24,280
把頭發染的和她一樣
She said you styled your hair like she did.

1017
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,550
你相信她
And you believed her.

1018
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:33,230
我曾去校園警局檢舉她
I had to go to the campus police and file a report about her.

1019
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:36,360
-你八成認為人是我殺的？
I suppose you still think I kill people too?

1020
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,060
不！
No！

1021
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,980
說謊
Liar.

1022
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:50,210
-你說是哪裡？ -舊金山凶殺組
- Who'd you say you're with? - Homicide,San Francisco.

1023
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,600
在這裡
Here we go.Kind of.

1024
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:59,680
的確有人報案檢舉麗莎何伯曼， 是在八零年一月
There was a report about Lisa Hoberman, January,1980.

1025
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,360
-但不在這裡. -誰拿去了？
- But it's out of here. - Who's got it?

1026
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:05,620
你們的人…尼爾森
One of your guys. Nilsen.

1027
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:08,030
-認識他？ -認識
- You know him? - Yeah.

1028
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,260
謝了
Thanks a lot.

1029
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:13,270
叫他拿回來. 他拿走一年了
Tell him to bring it back. He's had it a whole year.

1030
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:16,710
尼爾森拿了檔案又怎樣 你也不知道裡面寫什麼
So Nilsen had a report on Beth. You don't know what was in it.

1031
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:19,350
-凱瑟琳告訴我了. -她說的話能信嗎
- Catherine told me what was in it. - If she's telling you the truth.

1032
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:21,170
加斯，你還不明白嗎？
Gus,don't you get it?

1033
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,180
貝絲殺了強尼陷害凱瑟琳…
If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine...

1034
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:25,190
她怕別人知道柏克賴的往事！
she wouldn't want anybody to know what happened in Berkeley!

1035
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:28,310
但被尼爾森發現了，使她有動機殺他
But Nilsen found out about it. That gives her the motive to kill him.

1036
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,360
她怎麼知道尼爾森發現了？
How did she know Nilsen found out, if it happened?

1037
01:43:31,590 --> 01:43:33,750
他是風紀組長，或許他去問她！
He probably asked her!

1038
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,360
她一點也不象是神經病！
She'd have to be nuttier than a 20 pound fruitcake!

1039
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:39,330
她也不象是連環殺人狂！
She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers!

1040
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:41,970
-是你女朋友干的！ -她是作家，那是她的工作！
- You're girlfriend is! - She's a writer! That's her job!

1041
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:45,160
我才不信 柏克萊一定有人知道真相
I don't buy it. There must be somebody at Berkeley who knows what happened!

1042
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,170
我知道真相！凱瑟琳說的！
I know what happened! Catherine told me!

1043
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,300
- 我都去查過了！    - 你真的是...
- Everything she says has checked out! - You got tweety birds...

1044
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:52,600
 操B操昏頭了！
fluttering around in your head!

1045
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,740
你認為你可以隨便亂搞
You think you can fuck like minks, raise rug rats...

1046
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:56,780
然後永遠逍遙自在嗎？
and live happily ever after?

1047
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:58,780
少來了！
Oh,man!

1048
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:13,630
你怎麼進來的？
How'd you get in here?

1049
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,360
這是什麼？
What's this?

1050
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,660
我決定再給你一次機會
I decided to give you a second chance.

1051
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:22,770
-我想你. -我才剛走你就想我
- I missed you. - I wasn't gone long enough.

1052
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:25,040
你想我嗎？
Did you miss me?

1053
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:27,050
不想
No.

1054
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:40,790
過來告訴我你不想我
Why don't you come over here and tell me no.

1055
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:45,990
我已經看過了。- 是嗎？
- I've seen them before. - Yeah?

1056
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:48,800
不想再多看幾眼嗎？
Well,you might not see them again.

1057
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,060
我的書快完成了
My book's nearly finished.

1058
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:53,370
書中探長也快死了
My detective's almost dead.

1059
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,200
我可以吸最後一根煙嗎？
So I've got time for a last cigarette?

1060
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,610
事後再說
Afterwards.

1061
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:12,150
我明天早上要作些研究
I've got to do some research tomorrow morning.

1062
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:15,200
研究我很在行，我來幫你
I'm good at research. I'll help you.

1063
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:17,060
不用，謝了
No,thanks.

1064
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:20,330
你打算研究什麼？嗯...
What are you researching? Oh...

1065
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:23,660
替你的書找新的結局
a new ending to your book.

1066
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:26,730
真的？怎麼弄？
Oh,really? What's the twist?

1067
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:30,780
探長愛上不該愛的女人
The detective falls for the wrong girl.

1068
01:45:30,850 --> 01:45:33,610
但他沒死
But he doesn't die.

1069
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,280
他結果怎樣了？
So what happens to him?

1070
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:42,820
他們不停瘋狂的做愛…
They fuck like minks, raise rug rats...

1071
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:44,820
永遠過著幸福的日子
and live happily ever after.

1072
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,290
這不會暢銷
It won't sell.

1073
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,790
為什麼？
Why not?

1074
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:55,100
總得有人死掉
Somebody has to die.

1075
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:59,260
為什麼？
Why?

1076
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:03,610
天天有人死
Somebody always does.

1077
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,790
早安，我找嘉納大夫
Morning. I'm looking for a Dr. Garner.

1078
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:26,630
她已經不在這裡工作了. 她好象去舊金山警局
She doesn't work here anymore. She's in San Francisco with the police.

1079
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,230
我找的是他丈夫
Actually,I'm looking for her husband.

1080
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:31,600
-他也在這裡工作吧？ -約瑟夫嘉納？
- He works here too,doesn't he? - Dr. Joseph Garner?

1081
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:33,370
你認識他？
- She married? - You know him?

1082
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:36,300
他五六年前就去世了
He died about five or six years ago.

1083
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:40,250
-怎麼死的？ -中彈身亡
- How did he die? - He was shot.

1084
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:44,610
謝了
Thank you.

1085
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:48,350
他下班走路回家
He was walking home from work.

1086
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:50,850
他住所離辦公室很近
He only lived a couple of blocks from the clinic.

1087
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:52,590
有人開車經過射死她
Somebody just drove by and shot him.

1088
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:56,220
-是謀殺嗎？ -點三八左輪手槍
- What was the murder weapon? - Revolver,.38. Unrecovered.

1089
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:58,890
-小心些. -有疑犯嗎？
- Watch yourself. - Were there any suspects?

1090
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:02,590
沒有疑犯，沒有動機. 無頭懸案
No suspects,no motive. Unsolved.

1091
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,900
他的太太有嫌疑嗎？
Was his wife ever a suspect?

1092
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:09,630
大約一年前也有人來問過
One of your guys was down here from Frisco a year ago.

1093
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,150
他問了同樣的問題
He was asking the same,exact thing.

1094
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,180
可以告訴我怎麼回事嗎？
You mind telling me what's going on?

1095
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,770
例行公事
Routine.

1096
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:18,790
他是那樣說的
That's exactly what he said.

1097
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:21,790
現在你又來說是"例行公事"
Now I got two of you guys telling me it's "routine."

1098
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:24,190
記得那家伙的名字嗎？
You remember what the other guy's name was?

1099
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,590
不記得.我想不能確認
No. I can't really say that I do.

1100
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:32,170
尼爾森？
Nilsen?

1101
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:34,170
沒錯，正是
Yeah. That was it.

1102
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:39,300
-她曾經是疑犯嗎？ -沒有
- So was she ever a suspect? - No.

1103
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:41,770
是有些閒言閒語
There was some talk.

1104
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,900
但一直沒有證據
But it never panned out.

1105
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:46,980
-說些什麼？ -女人
- What kind of talk? - Girlfriend.

1106
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:49,270
他有別的女人？
He had a girlfriend?

1107
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:50,710
不
No.

1108
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,250
是她有女人
She did.

1109
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:59,790
如我所說，沒有證據
But like I said, it never panned out.

1110
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:04,660
-謝謝. -希望對你有幫助
- Thank you. - Hope that helped you out.

1111
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:08,900
是的，你幫了大忙
Yes,you did. You sure did.

1112
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:40,300
我好想你
I missed you.

1113
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:43,730
我弄完我的研究
I finished my research.

1114
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,280
-我的書寫完了. -故事是怎麼結尾的呢？
- I finished my book. - So how does it end?

1115
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:50,330
我跟你說過了
I told you.

1116
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:52,340
她殺了他
She kills him.

1117
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:57,180
再見，尼克
Good-bye,Nick.

1118
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:00,880
再見？
Good-bye?

1119
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:03,860
對，我的書寫完了
Yeah. I finished my book.

1120
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,620
你沒聽見嗎？
Didn't you hear me?

1121
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:10,290
你的人物死了
Your character's dead.

1122
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,730
再見
Good-bye.

1123
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:20,230
你還在等什麼，送花嗎？
What do you want,flowers?

1124
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,610
我會給你一本我親筆簽的書
I'll send you an autographed copy.

1125
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:26,980
這是干嘛，你在開什麼玩笑
What is this, some kind of joke?

1126
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:33,010
我們在玩游戲嗎？
You playing a game here?

1127
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:36,050
游戲結束了
The games are over.

1128
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:39,320
你說得對
You were right.

1129
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:43,730
它是本世紀最轟動的書，槍手
It was the fuck of the century, shooter.

1130
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,700
我馬上過去
I'll be right there.

1131
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,980
凱瑟琳楚梅大學一年級的室友
Catherine Tramell's roommate, freshman year?

1132
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:31,980
我剛接到她電話，她在奧克蘭. 快上車
I just got a call from her. She's in Oakland. Come on!

1133
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,280
我找了他宿捨的朋友 找了一整天
I've been phoning people from her dorm all day.

1134
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:37,910
她大概知道我想聯絡到她
She must've heard I was trying to reach her.

1135
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:42,010
她說她知道 凱瑟琳和麗莎何伯曼的底細
Says she knows all about Catherine and Lisa Hoberman.

1136
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:45,920
你還好吧？
You feeling okay?

1137
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,660
還有一件事
Here's something else.

1138
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:53,060
強尼巴茲的心理醫生 在凡內士有個辦公室
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an office on Van Ness.

1139
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:54,930
猜猜看他和誰共用那辦公室？
Guess who he shares space with?

1140
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,800
是伊麗莎白嘉納大夫
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1141
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:04,010
你究竟是怎麼一回事？
What in the hell's the matter with you?

1142
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:20,050
我會在405號房
I'll be in suite 405.

1143
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:24,550
-你要上哪去？ -和你一起去呀
- Where the hell you going? - I'm going with you.

1144
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:26,360
你在休假
You're on leave,Hoss.

1145
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:29,570
我不會去很久的
It ain't gonna take long.

1146
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:53,180
別動！
Freeze!

1147
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,870
你在這干嘛？
What are you doing here?

1148
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:56,810
把你他媽的手舉起來！
Put your fucking hands up!

1149
01:53:56,890 --> 01:53:58,820
加斯在我留言機上留言要會我
I got a message to meet Gus here.

1150
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:01,050
-他在哪裡？ -別動，叫你別動！
- Where is he? - Don't you move!

1151
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,850
我知道你先生是怎麼回事！ 你仍然是女同性戀嗎，貝絲？
I know about your husband! You still like girls,Beth?

1152
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,260
-什麼？ -把你的手從口袋裡拿出來！
- What? - Take you hands out of your pocket!

1153
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:10,890
-把手拿出來！ -你是怎麼了？
- Take them out! - What's wrong with you?

1154
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:12,300
把手拿出來！
Take them out!

1155
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:34,190
我愛你
I loved you.

1156
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,330
老天！
Oh,God!

1157
01:55:15,730 --> 01:55:18,060
你為什麼會以為她有槍？
What made you think she had a gun?

1158
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,740
她跑到這裡來干嘛？ 加斯在這做什麼？
What was she doing here? What was Gus doing here?

1159
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:28,940
組長
Lieutenant.

1160
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,270
我們的人
One of ours.

1161
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:03,770
老天
Jesus.

1162
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:06,210
我們得去搜貝絲的住所
We'll have to check Beth's apartment.

1163
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:10,940
點三八口徑的左輪槍
Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

1164
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:13,820
藏在書架上
In the bookcase, behind some books.

1165
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:19,320
查查它是不是殺尼爾森那把槍
Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.

1166
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,890
你最好進來看一下
Lieutenant. You better come in here.

1167
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:53,990
我想大致是這樣了
I guess that's it.

1168
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:13,840
絕對不是. 所有證據都不利於伊莉莎白嘉納
Definitely not. We feel all the evidence points to Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1169
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,910
我們查過了，是她的尺寸沒錯
We checked. It's her size.

1170
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:18,140
她在樓梯聽到你聲音 就把假發扔了
She probably heard you on the stairway and dumped this stuff.

1171
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:19,950
這裡沒有405
There's no suite 405.

1172
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:21,960
凱瑟琳楚梅的大一室友…
Catherine Tramell's freshman roommate is dead.

1173
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:23,960
兩年前就因血癌去世了
She died of leukemia two years ago.

1174
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:26,590
-這是她的死亡證明. -莎莉娜如何？
- Here's a fax of her death certificate. - What about Salinas?

1175
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:29,590
是嗎.等等，傑克！
Yeah,hold on. Jack!

1176
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:33,290
你去尼爾森辦公室 找過嘉納的檔案沒？
Did you check Nilsen's office for any files on Beth Garner?

1177
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:37,230
柏克森那沒有任何警方檔案
No police report from Berkeley. Nothing at all about Salinas.

1178
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:40,070
是我
I'm back.

1179
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:41,940
太好了
Great.

1180
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:45,270
專家說那把點三八口徑的左輪槍 與尼爾森的傷口吻合
Ballistics says the.38 we found in her apartment was used on Nilsen.

1181
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:47,810
沒有登記
No registration. They're checking with Salinas.

1182
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:50,650
冰錐和巴茲那案子的凶器 既同牌又同型
The ice pick was the same brand and model as the Boz weapon.

1183
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:53,120
查過了嘉納住所和辦公室的電話錄音--
Checked the tape machines at Dr. Garner's apartment and office...

1184
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:54,650
全部的辦公室
both here and the one on Van Ness.

1185
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:56,220
加斯沒在任何地方留言
There's no message from Gus on any of them.

1186
01:57:56,290 --> 01:57:58,260
她公寓裡的錄音機沒有用過

強尼巴茲的心理醫生說…
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he thinks he remembers...

1188
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:04,290
他記得嘉納和巴茲是一年前…
Dr. Garner and Boz meeting at a Christmas party at his house.

1189
01:58:04,570 --> 01:58:06,290
在他家舉行的聖誕派對中認識的
A year ago.

1190
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:12,230
人心莫測，對不對？
You just can't tell about people, can you?

1191
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:18,340
即便是上過床的女人
Even the ones you think you know inside and out.

1192
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:24,110
恭喜，柯倫

我聽說了…

1194
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:30,980
電視播了
On TV.

1195
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:45,730
我不能對你用情
I can't allow myself to care about you.

1196
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:51,670
我不能對…
I can't allow myself...

1197
01:59:51,770 --> 01:59:54,330
任何人用情
to care.

1198
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:59,710
我不想這麼做的
I don't want to do this.

1199
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:02,610
我不想這麼做的
Please. I don't want to do this.

1200
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:06,980
我失去了所有的人
I lose everybody.

1201
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:09,960
我不想失去你
I don't want to lose you.

1202
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,290
我們現在怎麼辦，尼克？
What do we do now?

1203
02:01:59,030 --> 02:02:02,590
拼命做愛…
Fuck like minks...

1204
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:06,070
象老鼠一樣快樂的活下去
raise rug rats and live happily ever after.

1205
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:18,640
我討厭老鼠
I hate rug rats.

1206
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:24,620
那拼命做愛好了，別想老鼠了…
Fuck like minks, forget the rug rats...

1207
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:27,660
快樂的生活下去
and live happily ever after.
