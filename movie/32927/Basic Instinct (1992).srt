1
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,876
- Here we go, Nick.
- All right

2
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,752
- Good morning, Detective.
- I want a shot of the two detectives.

3
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,836
Keep it back, folks.

4
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,846
- Howdy.
- Morning.

5
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,416
Up there.

6
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,856
- How's it going, Gus?
- Morning, Pete.

7
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:57,326
- Who was this fucking guy?
- Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

8
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,526
- Never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.

9
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,936
- Hey, Ronny, where they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.

10
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:05,566
Mid '60s, had five or six hits.
Got a club down on Fillmore now.

11
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,296
Not now, he don't.

12
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,906
Do we have a time
of death? Almost.

13
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,446
- Do you guys know Captain Tallcott?
- Sure.

14
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:16,776
- What's the Chief's office doing here?
- Observing.

15
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:22,776
- What's it say, Doc?
- Ninety-two degrees. About six hours.

16
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,416
Puts time of death
at around 2:00 a. m.

17
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:28,826
Can somebody close
the drapes over there?

18
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,526
Maid came in about an hour
ago and found the body.

19
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:33,936
- She's not a live-in.
- Maybe the maid did it.

20
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:36,536
She's 54 years old
and weighs 240 pounds.

21
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:39,066
- No bruises on the body.
- It ain't the maid.

22
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,536
Never know.

23
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,816
Sorry.

24
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,406
He was last seen leaving the club
with his girlfriend about midnight.

25
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:53,316
- What was it?
- Ice pick. Left it in the living room.

26
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:58,856
There's come stains
all over the sheets.

27
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:09,896
- Very impressive.
- He got off before he got off.

28
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:12,036
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.

29
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,806
Mr. Boz was a major contributor
to the mayor's campaign.

30
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,366
He was chairman of the board
of the Palace of Fine Arts.

31
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,416
I thought he was a
rock and roll star.

32
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,506
He was a retired
rock and roll star.

33
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:24,846
A civic-minded, very
respectable rock and roll star.

34
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,446
Then, what's that over there?

35
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,856
Looks like civic-minded,
very respectable cocaine.

36
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:38,296
Listen to me, Curran. I'm
gonna get a lot of heat on this.

37
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,296
I don't want any mistakes.

38
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,706
What's Boz's girl friend's name?

39
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,866
"Catherine Tramell,
162 Divisadero."

40
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:02,586
- Always a pleasure, Captain.
- He's up bright and early.

41
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,716
He doesn't usually punch
in 'til after his 18 holes.

42
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,296
Johnny and the mayor
must have been very tight.

43
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:10,735
Nick, keep your 3:00.

44
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:12,596
You want me to work the case...

45
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,426
- I said, keep it!
- All right.

46
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,296
I'll keep it.

47
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,712
Good morning. I'm Detective
Curran. This is Detective Moran.

48
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:56,406
San Francisco Police Department. I'd
like to speak to Catherine Tramell.

49
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,676
Come in.

50
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,756
Sit, please. Just a moment.

51
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:17,356
Ain't that cute? They got
his and hers Picasso's.

52
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:20,726
- I didn't know you knew a Picasso.
- Sure I do. It says right here.

53
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,756
Hers is bigger.

54
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,646
Sorry to bother you. We just
got a couple of questions.

55
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:39,446
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.

56
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,286
What do you want?

57
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,826
When was the last
time you saw John Boz?

58
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:46,656
Is he dead?

59
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:49,766
Why do you think he's dead?

60
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,496
Well, you wouldn't be
here otherwise, would you?

61
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,726
Were you with him last night?

62
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,336
You're looking for
Catherine, not me.

63
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:03,606
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxy.

64
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:07,676
I'm her friend.

65
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:14,486
Well, Roxy, do you know
where your friend is?

66
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:20,786
She's out at the beach house
at Stenson. Seadrift 1402.

67
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:22,356
Thanks.

68
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:27,366
You're wasting your time.

69
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:32,366
Catherine didn't kill him.

70
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,606
Miss Tramell?

71
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,536
Good afternoon. I'm Detective
Curran. This is Detective Moran.

72
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,006
- We're with the San Francisco Police...
- I know who you are.

73
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:15,836
So, how did he die?

74
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:17,406
He was murdered.

75
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:18,846
Obviously.

76
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:22,476
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.

77
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:28,826
How long were you dating him?

78
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,846
I wasn't dating him.
I was fucking him.

79
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,756
What are you, a pro?

80
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,626
No, I'm an amateur.

81
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,896
How long were you
having sex with him?

82
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,806
About a year and a half.

83
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,436
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.

84
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:48,682
Did you leave the club with him?

85
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:51,306
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?

86
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:55,316
No. We had a drink at the
club. We left together.

87
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:57,316
He went home, and
I came out here.

88
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:59,516
Was there anyone
with you last night?

89
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:02,816
No. I wasn't in
the mood last night.

90
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,596
Let me ask you
something, Miss Tramell.

91
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,796
Are you sorry he's dead?

92
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,836
Yeah.

93
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,436
I liked fucking him.

94
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,876
Look, I don't really
feel like talking anymore.

95
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,356
Listen, lady, we can do
this downtown, if you want.

96
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,446
So read me my rights
and arrest me...

97
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,686
and then I'll go downtown.

98
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,496
Otherwise, get the
fuck out of here.

99
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,596
Please.

100
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,026
Nice girl.

101
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:39,086
I'm sorry, Beth. I
got hung up in Stenson.

102
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:44,786
- How are you, Nick?
- I'm fine.

103
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:47,796
Come on, Beth. You know I'm fine. How
long do we have to keep doing this?

104
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,856
As long as Internal Affairs
wants you to, I suppose.

105
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,886
- Have a seat.
- It's bullshit. You know it is.

106
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:58,056
I know it is. But sit down, anyway,
so we can get it over with, okay?

107
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:08,776
So, how are things?

108
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:11,815
Things are fine.

109
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:14,686
I told you, all
right? Things are fine.

110
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,656
How is your personal life?

111
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:18,686
My sex life is fine.

112
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:24,696
My sex life is actually pretty
shitty since I stopped seeing you.

113
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,566
I started developing calluses.

114
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,576
Sorry.

115
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:39,906
How's the booze?

116
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:42,546
Haven't had a drink
in three months.

117
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:45,716
- What about the coke?
- No.

118
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:49,886
No. I'm working my ass
off. I'm off the sauce.

119
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,046
I even stopped smoking.

120
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,756
How is not smoking?

121
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,816
It sucks.

122
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,896
Now, will you tell I.A.
I'm just your average...

123
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:03,565
healthy, totally
fucked up cop...

124
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:06,596
and let me out of here, please?

125
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,276
Yes.

126
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,306
Thank you.

127
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:28,086
I still miss you, Nick.

128
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,836
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

129
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,876
Tallcott's in there. They're
waiting. How did it go?

130
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:44,776
She misses me.

131
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:47,816
Boy, when that girl
mates, it's for life.

132
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,076
All right, let's
start. Harrigan.

133
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,586
Well, we got 31 stab
wounds, neck and the chest.

134
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:55,316
No usable prints, no forceable
entry, nothing missing.

135
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:58,846
No prints on the ice pick, either.
You can pick it up at any K-Mart.

136
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,896
The scarf was Hermes.
It's expensive.

137
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:05,056
They sell about 20,000
a year, worldwide.

138
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:09,096
Bottle was cocaine. High quality,
high content. He inhaled it.

139
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,326
There were minute quantities
on his lips and penis.

140
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,336
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million.

141
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,376
No direct survivors.
No criminal record.

142
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:20,706
He liked his drugs. He liked his
girls. He liked his rock and roll.

143
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,406
He liked the mayor too, right?

144
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,876
What about his girlfriend?

145
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,086
- Is she relevant here? Is she a suspect?
- She's a suspect.

146
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,696
On what basis?

147
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:37,856
"Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell.
Age 30. No priors. No convictions."

148
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,426
Magna cum laude
at Berkeley, 1983.

149
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:43,106
Double major: Literature
and psychology.

150
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,736
Daughter, sole survivor,
Marvin and Elaine Tramell...

151
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:48,336
killed in a boating
accident, 1979.

152
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:52,746
"Catherine Tramell, sole heir.
Estimated assets: $ 110 million."

153
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,785
You're shitting me.

154
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,616
"Formerly engaged to
Manuel Vasquez, deceased."

155
00:16:57,656 --> 00:17:00,276
Whoa, whoa! Manny Vasquez?

156
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,726
Former middleweight contender. Killed
in the ring, Atlantic City, 1984.

157
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:06,026
I love it. She's got
100 million bucks.

158
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:08,286
She fucks fighters and
rock and roll stars...

159
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,526
and she's got a degree in
screwing with people's heads.

160
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:13,466
You forgot about her degree
in literature. She's a writer.

161
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:17,666
She published a novel under a pen
name. Want to know what it's about?

162
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:22,676
It's about a retired rock and roll star
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

163
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:37,726
Page 67, cowboy.

164
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:40,316
You know how she
does the boyfriend?

165
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:43,856
With an ice pick, in bed...

166
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:47,456
his hands tied with
a white silk scarf.

167
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:53,906
Dr. Garner.

168
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:59,276
I've asked Dr. Lamont to consult
with us. This isn't really my turf.

169
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,476
Dr. Lamont teaches the pathology of
psychopathic behavior at Stanford...

170
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:06,316
and also on the Justice Department
Psychological Profile Team.

171
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,356
Dr. Lamont.

172
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,286
I see two possibilities.

173
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:16,296
One: The person who wrote
this book is your murderer...

174
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:20,496
and acted out the killing described
in ritualistic, literal detail.

175
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:23,726
Two: Someone who wants
to harm the writer...

176
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:27,436
read the book and enacted the
killing described to incriminate her.

177
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,276
What if the writer did it?
Then what are we dealing with?

178
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:33,676
You're dealing with a
devious, diabolical mind.

179
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,346
You see, this book had to have
been written at least six months...

180
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,316
maybe even years...
before it was published...

181
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:43,886
which means the writer must have planned
the crime in the subconscious back then.

182
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,356
Now, the fact that
she carried it out...

183
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,486
indicates psychopathic
obsessive behavior...

184
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,565
in terms not only of
the killing itself...

185
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:54,436
but also in terms of the applied
advance defense mechanism.

186
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:59,466
Sometimes I can't tell
shit from shinola, Doc.

187
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,066
What was all that you just said?

188
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:03,576
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.

189
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,492
She's going to say, "Do you think
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone..."

190
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:08,816
in the exact way I
described in my book?"

191
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:11,286
I wouldn't do that because
I know I'd be the suspect.

192
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,916
So, what if it's not the writer? What
if it's someone who read the book?

193
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,526
You're dealing, then,
with someone so obsessed...

194
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:23,826
that he or she is willing to kill
an irrelevant and innocent victim...

195
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,096
in order to place the blame on
the person who wrote that book.

196
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:30,866
I'm talking about a deep-seated
obsessional hatred...

197
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:33,836
and an utter lack of
respect for human life.

198
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:44,776
So, we got a once in a lifetime,
top of the line looney-tuney.

199
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,916
That's what you're
saying, right, Doc?

200
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:51,856
You're dealing with
someone very dangerous...

201
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,586
and very ill.

202
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:02,626
You know there's no case here.
You've got no physical evidence.

203
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,426
She hasn't got an alibi.

204
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:08,436
She hasn't got a motive,
either. Believe me...

205
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,445
her defense would just beat us
to death with this copycat thing.

206
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:14,816
Anybody who read the
book could have done it.

207
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:19,306
- What do you want to do now? Nothing?
- We call her in for questioning.

208
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:21,362
She's got enough money to
burn the department down...

209
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,586
She was the last person
seen with the guy.

210
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,426
I'll take the responsibility.

211
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:29,466
It's yours.

212
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:33,296
It won't do any good.

213
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,456
She'll just waltz in with
some superstar lawyer...

214
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:38,435
who'll get us all canned for
wasting the taxpayers' money.

215
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,876
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No, she won't.

216
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:46,406
I don't think she'll
hide behind anybody.

217
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,536
I don't think she's
gonna hide at all.

218
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:51,546
Then she's as crazy
as you are, Curran.

219
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:58,546
You know what they say:

220
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:01,356
Takes one to know one.

221
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:29,686
Miss Tramell, we'd like you to come
downtown to answer a few questions.

222
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,856
Are you arresting me?

223
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:34,916
If that's the way
you want to play it.

224
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:38,396
Could I change into
something more appropriate?

225
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,726
It'll only take a
minute. Come on in.

226
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,906
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll be right back.

227
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:06,686
Hey, Gus. Hmm?

228
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,686
- So, how long is this gonna take?
- I don't know.

229
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,366
Do you always keep
old newspapers around?

230
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:21,376
Only when they make
interesting reading.

231
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:39,616
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.

232
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:42,356
Why would I need an attorney?

233
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:55,436
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

234
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:57,446
Yes, you do.

235
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:01,946
- I quit.
- Congratulations.

236
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:16,326
I thought you didn't
have any cigarettes.

237
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,796
Oh, I found some in my
pocket. Would you like one?

238
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:24,326
I told you, I quit.

239
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:26,566
It won't last.

240
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:34,776
- You working on another book?
- Yes, I am.

241
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:38,616
It must really be something
making stuff up all the time.

242
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:41,386
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.

243
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:44,386
How's that?

244
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:49,366
You make up believable stuff. It's
called suspension of disbelief.

245
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,726
I like that!
Suspension of disbelief.

246
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,526
What's your new book about?

247
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:03,406
A detective. He falls
for the wrong woman.

248
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,606
What happens?

249
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:12,776
She kills him.

250
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:27,566
I'm John Carreli, Miss Tramell,
assistant district attorney.

251
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:29,626
I have to inform you this
session's being taped.

252
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:32,566
- This is Captain Tallcott.
- My pleasure.

253
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:34,666
- And Lieutenant Walker.
- Hi.

254
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:37,406
- Can we get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

255
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,446
Are your attorneys
going to join us?

256
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,606
Miss Tramell has waived
her rights to an attorney.

257
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:47,656
Did I miss something?

258
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:49,686
I told them you wouldn't
want an attorney present.

259
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:53,596
Why have you waived your right
to an attorney, Miss Tramell?

260
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,596
Why did you think
I wouldn't want one?

261
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,786
I told them you
wouldn't want to hide.

262
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:00,566
I have nothing to hide.

263
00:25:14,316 --> 00:25:16,676
There's no smoking
in this building.

264
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,786
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

265
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,566
Would you tell us the nature of
your relationship with Mr. Boz?

266
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,576
I had sex with him for
about a year and a half.

267
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:44,836
I liked having sex with him.

268
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,506
He wasn't afraid
of experimenting.

269
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:51,606
I like men like that.

270
00:25:51,656 --> 00:25:53,776
Men who give me pleasure.

271
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,856
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

272
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:07,526
You ever engage in any
sadomasochistic activity?

273
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:12,336
Exactly what did you
have in mind, Mr. Carreli?

274
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:16,776
- You ever tie him up?
- No.

275
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:18,436
You never tied him up?

276
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:20,476
No.

277
00:26:20,516 --> 00:26:23,416
Johnny liked to use
his hands too much.

278
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:26,456
I like hands and fingers.

279
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:30,716
You describe a white
silk scarf in your book.

280
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,526
I've always had a fondness
for white silk scarves.

281
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,566
They're good for all occasions.

282
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:39,366
But you said you liked men to
use their hands, didn't you?

283
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:41,766
No, I said I liked
Johnny to use his hands.

284
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:47,826
I don't make any rules,
Nick. I go with the flow.

285
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:51,806
Did you kill Mr.
Boz, Miss Tramell?

286
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,846
I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about killing...

287
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,886
and then kill somebody the
way I described it in my book.

288
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,816
I'd be announcing myself as
the killer. I'm not stupid.

289
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,786
We know you're not stupid.

290
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:05,772
Maybe that's what you're counting
on to get you off the hook.

291
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,586
Writing the book
gives you an alibi.

292
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,386
Yes, it does.

293
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:15,766
The answer's no.
I didn't kill him.

294
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:21,606
- Do you use drugs, Miss Tramell?
- Sometimes.

295
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:24,606
- Did you ever use drugs with Mr. Boz?
- Sure.

296
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,806
What kind of drugs?

297
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:28,036
Cocaine.

298
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,386
Have you ever fucked
on cocaine, Nick?

299
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,436
It's nice.

300
00:27:57,816 --> 00:27:59,806
You like playing
games, don't you?

301
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,816
I have a degree in psychology.
It goes with the turf.

302
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,716
Games are fun.

303
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:08,486
What about boxing? That's
a game. Is that fun too?

304
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:11,646
I don't think that's
relevant to this inquiry.

305
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:14,096
Boxing was fun 'til Manny died.

306
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,056
How did you feel when he died?

307
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:18,686
I loved him. It hurt.

308
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,066
How did you feel when I
told you Johnny Boz had died?

309
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,036
I felt like someone had read
my book and was playing a game.

310
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:26,596
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.

311
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:28,052
- Because you didn't love him?
- That's right.

312
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:29,596
Even though you
were fucking him?

313
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:31,606
You still get the pleasure.

314
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,546
Didn't you ever fuck anybody
else when you were married, Nick?

315
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,076
How'd you know he was married?

316
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:38,576
Maybe I was just guessing.

317
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:40,816
What difference does it make?

318
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,716
Would you like a
cigarette, Nick?

319
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:57,566
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

320
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,706
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

321
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:06,266
I wanted to write a book about the
murder of a retired rock and roll star.

322
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:09,716
I went down to his club, I picked
him up and I had sex with him.

323
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,046
You didn't feel anything for him? You
just had sex with him for your book?

324
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:19,746
In the beginning. Then I got
to like what he did for me.

325
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:22,766
That's pretty cold,
ain't it, lady?

326
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:25,556
I'm a writer. I use
people for what I write.

327
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,696
Let the world beware.

328
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:33,006
Do you want me to take
a lie detector test?

329
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,586
Wait here, please.

330
00:29:51,596 --> 00:29:54,556
No blips, no blood pressure
variations, no pulse variance.

331
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,726
Either she's telling the truth,
or I've never seen anyone like her.

332
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,836
I guess that settles it.

333
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:08,266
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can't fool the machine.

334
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,706
Trust me. It can be done.

335
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:11,606
And what makes
you such an expert?

336
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:15,336
Because I know people
that have done it.

337
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:21,276
Thank you.

338
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:24,326
Thanks for coming in, Miss
Tramell. Sorry to inconvenience you.

339
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,846
Could someone give
me a ride home?

340
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,896
Sure.

341
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,926
Thank you.

342
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:39,056
Want to get a drink?

343
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,716
- Rough day?
- Not really.

344
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:54,276
Beating that machine
can't be easy.

345
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:59,816
If I was guilty and wanted to beat
that machine, it wouldn't be hard.

346
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,756
It wouldn't be hard at all.

347
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:10,356
You took a lie detector test after
you shot those two people, didn't you?

348
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:14,066
I passed.

349
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,906
You see? We're
both innocent, Nick.

350
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:40,426
You seem to know an
awful lot about me.

351
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:42,936
You know an awful lot about me.

352
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:47,266
I don't know anything
that's not police business.

353
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:53,906
You know I don't wear any
underwear. Don't you, Nick?

354
00:32:02,726 --> 00:32:05,286
Thanks for the ride.

355
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,396
Would you like
another glass of wine?

356
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:24,906
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.

357
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:28,646
What's all this "Nick" stuff?

358
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:31,306
"Nick, do you want a cigarette?
Nick, can I have a ride?"

359
00:32:31,386 --> 00:32:33,946
She didn't ask me to give
her a ride. She asked anybody.

360
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,686
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?

361
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:40,086
No, Chuckie. Get me a double
blackjack on the rocks, please.

362
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,866
What you doing, Hoss?

363
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:47,856
I haven't had a
drink in three months.

364
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:51,366
All right with you, cowboy?

365
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:54,396
- She doesn't know me, okay?
- Here you go.

366
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:57,436
I never seen her before
Gus and I talked with her.

367
00:32:57,506 --> 00:32:59,446
- Thanks, Chuck.
- You're sure?

368
00:32:59,516 --> 00:33:01,506
Yes, I'm sure.

369
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:03,476
Cheers.

370
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,346
Now what?

371
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,356
What "now what"? Now nothing.

372
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:16,366
She passed the
polygraph. That's it.

373
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:18,456
She knew how to beat it,
that's why she took it.

374
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:21,726
How in the fuck do you know? What
is it with you and this broad?

375
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,396
Come on, Phil. Don't
let this one slide.

376
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:26,782
What about her parents? What
about what else she published?

377
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:28,776
Maybe all her books come true.

378
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:31,836
Her parents died in an accident. I
don't care what else she published.

379
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:34,276
What are you, a book critic?

380
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:37,446
How'd they die? Was
there an investigation?

381
00:33:37,486 --> 00:33:40,786
You're saying she killed her parents?
Did she kill Manny Vasquez too?

382
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:45,946
Not unless she climbed into the ring
and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

383
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:49,486
Maybe she did. Maybe she
grew herself an afro...

384
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:52,356
developed a hell of a left hook and
put shoe polish all over her face.

385
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:54,836
- Let's polygraph her again.
- Fuck you.

386
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,405
Fuck you too.

387
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:58,736
Don't worry, Phil.
Nick'll fuck himself.

388
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:02,576
You guys are very funny. Hey,
Chuckie, get me another double.

389
00:34:02,746 --> 00:34:05,306
Hey, shooter!

390
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,276
Are you back on the
blackjack, shooter?

391
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,806
- We're discussing a case here.
- I know that. I have no doubts.

392
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,786
Here you go, Nick.

393
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:17,826
A double, huh, shooter?

394
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:23,896
I'm off duty, Nilsen.

395
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:30,066
You hear me? I'm off
duty discussing a case.

396
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:32,776
Now, I.A. Shouldn't
have a problem with that.

397
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:37,406
Maybe I should put
in for some overtime?

398
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:43,806
Don't work too hard, shooter.
It might drive you to drink.

399
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:50,286
Stop riding me, man! I'll
kick your fucking teeth in!

400
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:53,816
- What's the problem?
- No problem, Doctor.

401
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:57,926
Here comes the shrink, just in
time to save her favorite patient.

402
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,526
Just fuck off, Marty!

403
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:03,856
You kids have a good
time tonight, huh?

404
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:13,476
- He's asking for it.
- That's right, so don't take the bait.

405
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:18,546
Do you want to go?

406
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:21,916
- Yes.
- Let's go.

407
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:28,916
Sometimes I think he started banging
her just to get Internal Affairs off him.

408
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:33,366
He ain't that way.
He's got a heart.

409
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,526
What was she like?

410
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,326
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.

411
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,376
You had her pegged. She
used her book as an alibi.

412
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:00,576
I met her at Berkeley.

413
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:05,546
We were in some of
the same classes.

414
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:08,386
Why didn't you tell me?

415
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:10,426
I'm telling you.

416
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:23,706
You've never been
like that before. Why?

417
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,706
You tell me. You're the shrink.

418
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:31,706
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?

419
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:34,376
You weren't making love.

420
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:40,346
I need a cigarette.

421
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:42,616
I thought you said you quit.

422
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:51,565
It's the top
drawer in the foyer.

423
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:54,556
Get it on your way out!

424
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:07,306
- Have you started?
- Waitin' on you.

425
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,546
- You look like dog shit.
- No, he looks a little shrunk is all.

426
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,846
And not just in the head.

427
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,686
All right, I made a couple
of calls to Berkeley.

428
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:18,486
There was a murder
in '80. A professor.

429
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:22,616
In his bed, multiple stab
wounds, with an ice pick.

430
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:26,796
Tramell was there
then, wasn't she?

431
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,526
University records say she was.

432
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:34,406
Okay, let's move on this.
Gus, get out to Berkeley.

433
00:39:34,476 --> 00:39:36,496
Harrigan, find out what
else she's published.

434
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:38,352
Andrews, get me that file
on the parents' accident.

435
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,866
Copy Beth on everything.
I want psychological input.

436
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:44,506
- What about me?
- You're already getting input.

437
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:47,516
You go soak your head
in a tub of ice water.

438
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:57,826
You see where she leads.

439
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,796
You have a good weekend.

440
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:26,536
You too.

441
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:27,906
Drive carefully.

442
00:43:28,076 --> 00:43:30,566
- I will.
- Bye-bye.

443
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:31,876
I'll call you.

444
00:45:53,286 --> 00:45:56,916
Ain't you got nothing better to do
than to jack off the damn machine?

445
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,816
What are you doing here, cowboy?

446
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,916
I came in here to jack
off the damn machine.

447
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:04,656
One dead psychology professor.

448
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:08,756
Dr. Noah Goldstein.
And guess what?

449
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:11,706
He was her counselor.

450
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,075
Was she a suspect?

451
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:16,066
No, sir. They never even
got a statement from her.

452
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:19,776
Hazel Dobkins?

453
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:21,706
Do you know her?

454
00:46:21,776 --> 00:46:24,306
Couldn't get it out
of my head for years.

455
00:46:24,386 --> 00:46:26,906
Nice little housewife.
Three little kids.

456
00:46:26,956 --> 00:46:30,756
Nice husband wasn't porking
around. No financial problems.

457
00:46:30,826 --> 00:46:35,656
One day, out of the clear blue
sky, she does them, all of them.

458
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:38,756
Used a knife she got
for a wedding present.

459
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:42,096
Didn't even deny
it. Sweet as honey.

460
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:45,066
Said she didn't know
why she'd done it.

461
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,786
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?

462
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:03,816
No, come on in.

463
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:06,826
Let's go upstairs.

464
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:25,936
I'm using you for my
detective in my book.

465
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,306
You don't mind, do you?

466
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:34,816
I was just gonna
make myself a drink.

467
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:36,846
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

468
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,856
Oh, right. You're off the
Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

469
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:46,726
I've got a few more
questions to ask you.

470
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:49,856
I have some for you
too. For my book.

471
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,866
Do you have something
against ice cubes?

472
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,906
I like rough edges.

473
00:48:04,946 --> 00:48:07,946
So, what did you want to ask me?

474
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:10,516
How does it feel
to kill someone?

475
00:48:13,426 --> 00:48:14,826
You tell me.

476
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:19,386
I don't know, but you do.

477
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:22,866
It was an accident.

478
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:24,836
They got in the line of fire.

479
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:31,906
Four shootings in five
years, all accidents?

480
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:36,776
They were drug buys. I
was working undercover.

481
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:41,586
You want to tell me
about Professor Goldstein?

482
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:46,926
Well, there's a
name from the past.

483
00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:50,296
You want a name from the
present? What about Hazel Dobkins?

484
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:55,866
Noah Goldstein was my
counselor my fresh man year.

485
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:59,396
That's probably where I got the
idea for the ice pick for my book.

486
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:03,566
Funny how the
subconscious works.

487
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:05,266
Hilarious.

488
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:11,386
- Hazel's my friend.
- Your friend took out her whole family.

489
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:14,546
Yes, she helped me
understand homicidal impulse.

490
00:49:14,586 --> 00:49:16,556
I thought you would have
learned that at school.

491
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:20,326
Only in theory.

492
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:25,526
But you know all about homicidal
impulse, don't you, shooter?

493
00:49:27,896 --> 00:49:30,496
Not in theory, in practice.

494
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:34,366
What happened? Did
you get sucked into it?

495
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:37,276
Did you like it too much?

496
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,776
I don't know what
you're talking about.

497
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:46,376
Tell me about the coke, Nick.

498
00:49:48,456 --> 00:49:51,446
The day you shot
those two tourists...

499
00:49:51,526 --> 00:49:53,496
how much coke did you do?

500
00:49:57,296 --> 00:50:00,496
Come on, you can tell me.

501
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,306
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

502
00:50:10,346 --> 00:50:13,576
They never tested you, did they?

503
00:50:13,616 --> 00:50:16,586
Internal Affairs knew.

504
00:50:18,646 --> 00:50:21,646
Your wife knew too, didn't she?

505
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:29,486
She knew what was going on.

506
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:34,356
I think you got too
close to the flame.

507
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,366
I think you liked it.

508
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:51,476
That's why she killed herself.

509
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,686
Hi, hon.

510
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:16,396
You two have met, haven't you?

511
00:51:24,946 --> 00:51:28,476
You're gonna make a
terrific character, Nick.

512
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:41,000
She's on the phone.
She'll be right with you.

513
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,696
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Detective, you can't go in...

514
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:48,466
- Who's got access to my file?
- What are you talking about?

515
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:50,596
Who has access to
my goddamn file?

516
00:51:50,676 --> 00:51:54,506
Nobody. It's a confidential
psychiatric record. It would be illegal.

517
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:57,346
Don't you fucking lie to me!

518
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,386
It was Internal
Affairs, wasn't it?

519
00:51:59,456 --> 00:52:00,476
No, please.

520
00:52:00,556 --> 00:52:03,526
- Who?
- It's Nilson.

521
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,736
What do you want, Curran?

522
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:18,426
You sold her my
file, didn't you?

523
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:20,526
Who are you talking about?

524
00:52:20,576 --> 00:52:23,976
Catherine Tramell. How
much did she pay you?

525
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:27,646
Hey, Curran, come
on! Damn it, stop it!

526
00:52:27,716 --> 00:52:28,976
How much?

527
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:34,976
Hey, back off! Back off, Curran!

528
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:38,356
Nice and easy
now. Nice and easy.

529
00:52:38,426 --> 00:52:41,356
You fucked yourself, shooter.
You hear me? You are out!

530
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:43,826
- Curran, take it easy.
- You are out!

531
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:46,996
Save it, save it.

532
00:52:50,506 --> 00:52:52,696
- What's going down, Hoss?
- Nothing. I'll be okay.

533
00:52:52,776 --> 00:52:56,036
- They're gonna want your badge.
- I'm tired of being played with.

534
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:58,706
You got a real conclusive
way of demonstrating that.

535
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:08,316
She knows where I
live and breathe.

536
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,756
She's coming after me, Gus.

537
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,696
What is it you got between you?

538
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:22,356
- I don't know.
- Something, though.

539
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:25,496
Something.

540
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:46,556
Nick, are you there?

541
00:53:46,596 --> 00:53:49,526
Go away, Beth. I
don't want to see you.

542
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:58,596
I still have my key.

543
00:54:00,406 --> 00:54:02,336
Put them on the table and leave.

544
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:07,576
Put them on the
goddamn table and leave!

545
00:54:07,646 --> 00:54:10,676
Damn it! Don't shove me out!
You owe me more than that!

546
00:54:13,356 --> 00:54:15,756
I don't owe you anything!

547
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:18,656
And you don't owe me anything.

548
00:54:18,686 --> 00:54:21,786
We went to bed,
what, 10, 15 times?

549
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:25,656
It wasn't memorable enough
to carry an obligation.

550
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:30,326
Sometimes I really hate you.

551
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:32,856
Why don't you get yourself some
friendly little therapist...

552
00:54:33,376 --> 00:54:35,566
to work out some
of that hostility?

553
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,736
And maybe you can get
off once in a while.

554
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,476
Are you nuts?

555
00:54:53,596 --> 00:54:54,856
I'm sorry.

556
00:54:57,396 --> 00:54:59,726
I don't usually act like that.

557
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,566
How could you give him my file?

558
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,326
I had to!

559
00:55:04,406 --> 00:55:08,336
He was going to recommend
your discharge from the force.

560
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:11,566
He didn't buy my evaluation.
He said I wasn't objective.

561
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:15,515
So I made a deal with him to
review the session notes himself.

562
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:17,746
I didn't think he'd
show them to anybody.

563
00:55:17,816 --> 00:55:20,686
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

564
00:55:20,756 --> 00:55:23,486
I care about you.
I did it for you.

565
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:32,426
Go away. Please, just go away.

566
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,736
I'm on my way.

567
00:56:59,956 --> 00:57:04,516
One shot. Close range.
Probably a.38 caliber revolver.

568
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:08,416
Give me your gun, Nick.

569
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,866
You think that...

570
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:27,676
I don't, Hoss. But I
got the minority opinion.

571
00:57:32,046 --> 00:57:36,676
Okay, I went after
him! I lost my temper.

572
00:57:36,756 --> 00:57:39,746
Do you have any evidence that he
showed your psychiatric file to anyone?

573
00:57:46,736 --> 00:57:48,696
We'll speak with you
afterwards, Dr. Garner.

574
00:57:48,736 --> 00:57:50,726
- I'd like to sit in.
- I'd really rather wait...

575
00:57:50,806 --> 00:57:54,736
It's all right if Dr. Garner sits in,
if Detective Curran doesn't object.

576
00:58:00,646 --> 00:58:03,616
- Where were you last night?
- Home, watching TV.

577
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,446
All night?

578
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:07,646
Yes, all night.

579
00:58:07,716 --> 00:58:09,876
Were you drinking?

580
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,486
Yeah, I was drinking.

581
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:18,496
- When did you start drinking again?
- A couple of days ago.

582
00:58:18,526 --> 00:58:21,766
I saw Detective Curran at his
apartment about 10:00 last night.

583
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,736
He was sober and lucid.

584
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:26,566
I asked him, in my capacity as
his departmental therapist...

585
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:28,696
about his altercation
with Lieutenant Nilsen.

586
00:58:28,736 --> 00:58:32,036
He expressed regret and
displayed no hostility.

587
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:35,876
- How long were you at his apartment?
- About 15 minutes.

588
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:39,536
I saw there was no reason
for my concern and left.

589
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,276
There's no smoking in
this building, Detective.

590
00:58:44,526 --> 00:58:46,486
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

591
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:51,726
Oh, for Christ's... All right, Nick,
I'm gonna ask you this just once.

592
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:55,066
For the record, did
you kill Marty Nilsen?

593
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,896
No.

594
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:01,696
I'm gonna storm into his
office in front of everybody...

595
00:59:01,776 --> 00:59:03,746
in the middle of the day
and kill him that night?

596
00:59:03,776 --> 00:59:05,746
I'm not that dumb.

597
00:59:05,806 --> 00:59:09,766
Going after him before gets you off the
hook for killing him. That's your alibi.

598
00:59:09,816 --> 00:59:13,476
Like writing a book about killing a guy
gets you off the hook for killing him.

599
00:59:13,556 --> 00:59:14,556
Good point.

600
00:59:14,616 --> 00:59:16,556
What are you talking about?

601
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,886
- A private joke, asshole.
- I don't think it's funny.

602
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,526
You're going on leave...

603
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:25,856
pending the outcome of
a psychiatric evaluation.

604
00:59:37,906 --> 00:59:40,606
I'll get my stuff in a minute.

605
00:59:44,986 --> 00:59:46,316
Thank you.

606
00:59:50,756 --> 00:59:52,846
It's the least I could do.

607
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:55,756
Considering I got you into
this mess with those reports.

608
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,596
No, I mean it. Thank you.

609
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,366
How do you know Catherine
Tramell saw your file?

610
01:00:03,406 --> 01:00:07,066
She knows things about
me that I only told you.

611
01:00:07,306 --> 01:00:09,706
She must really be something.

612
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:12,266
From a clinical point of view.

613
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:14,906
- What was she like in school?
- I hardly knew her.

614
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:16,746
She gave me the creeps.

615
01:00:16,816 --> 01:00:18,746
I don't know why.

616
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:25,876
Get some rest. Promise?

617
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:34,886
- I didn't mean what I said about...
- Yes, you did.

618
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:37,936
I'm a big girl. I can handle it.

619
01:01:01,796 --> 01:01:04,886
- You take care of yourself.
- What'd you find out about the parents?

620
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:07,895
No lead, man.

621
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:11,296
You're on psycho leave. I'm
talking to a possible wacko!

622
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:14,306
You know I'm wacko.
What'd you find out?

623
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:21,406
The boat blew. There was
a leak in the fuel line.

624
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:25,446
There were two previous repairs and
a five mil policy on both of them.

625
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:27,816
A real heavy investigation
but they got zilch.

626
01:01:27,856 --> 01:01:30,686
Big goose egg. It
was an "accident."

627
01:01:30,726 --> 01:01:34,316
I.A.'s gonna talk to you about Nilsen.
They're handling the investigation.

628
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:36,886
Stay in touch with Dr. Garner.
It'll help on the evaluation.

629
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:40,656
She killed him.

630
01:01:40,736 --> 01:01:42,312
Beth? Now you've got
Beth killing people?

631
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:44,266
Catherine Tramell.
It's part of her game.

632
01:01:44,336 --> 01:01:48,366
First you got her stealing your
file, now she's killing Nilsen?

633
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:51,376
Forget about her! Go
somewhere, sit in the sun.

634
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:54,846
- Get her the hell out of your system!
- You don't buy it, do you?

635
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:57,276
She knew nobody'd buy it.

636
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:00,716
She knew I'd say she did
it and nobody'd buy it!

637
01:02:00,756 --> 01:02:03,916
She is screwing with your
head! Stay away from her!

638
01:02:31,486 --> 01:02:32,916
I heard what happened.

639
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:44,756
What good's a shooter
without his gun?

640
01:02:44,826 --> 01:02:47,796
- How exactly did you find out?
- I have attorneys.

641
01:02:47,866 --> 01:02:50,836
They have friends.
I have friends.

642
01:02:50,906 --> 01:02:53,496
Money buys a lot of
attorneys and friends.

643
01:02:53,706 --> 01:02:55,836
I wouldn't know about that.
I don't have any money...

644
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:59,706
I don't have any attorneys,
and Gus is my only real friend.

645
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,836
I wasn't talking
about real friends.

646
01:03:06,346 --> 01:03:08,716
Why doesn't Gus like me?

647
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:11,516
I like you.

648
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:14,286
- You do?
- Yes.

649
01:03:15,356 --> 01:03:18,526
You want to go upstairs
and have a drink?

650
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,526
I didn't think you'd ask me.

651
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,536
I guess you don't know
your character that well.

652
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:29,436
Maybe, but I'm learning.

653
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:32,336
Pretty soon I'll know you
better than you know yourself.

654
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:34,506
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?

655
01:03:34,576 --> 01:03:37,346
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?

656
01:03:47,396 --> 01:03:49,556
You should put some
warmth into the place.

657
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:52,356
You don't want it to
reflect your personality.

658
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:53,956
I'm not trying to fool anybody.

659
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:56,866
Jack Daniels all right?
It's going to have to be.

660
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,866
- Ice?
- Great.

661
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,466
I was expecting you.

662
01:04:13,456 --> 01:04:14,946
K-Mart. A buck, sixty-five.

663
01:04:21,426 --> 01:04:23,556
Why don't you let
me do this for you.

664
01:04:31,466 --> 01:04:33,806
You like watching
me do it, don't you?

665
01:04:36,436 --> 01:04:39,406
Could I have a
cigarette too, please?

666
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:41,916
I told you you'd
start smoking again.

667
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:44,936
Would you light it for me?

668
01:04:50,156 --> 01:04:52,086
Thanks.

669
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:58,316
So how much did you
pay Nilsen for my file?

670
01:04:58,356 --> 01:05:02,816
Isn't he the policeman
that you shot, shooter?

671
01:05:02,896 --> 01:05:05,196
What if I ask you not
to call me "shooter"?

672
01:05:05,266 --> 01:05:08,826
Okay. How about if
I call you Nicky?

673
01:05:10,276 --> 01:05:12,896
My wife used to call me Nicky.

674
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:17,546
Yeah, I know. I like it.

675
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:23,786
Cheers. My friend
call me Catherine.

676
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:26,586
What did Manny Vasquez call you?

677
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:28,456
Bitch, mostly.

678
01:05:28,526 --> 01:05:30,856
But he meant it affectionately.

679
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:34,516
Do you have any coke?

680
01:05:35,596 --> 01:05:37,856
I just love coke
with Jack Daniels.

681
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:39,866
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

682
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,496
It's not really the
same thing now, is it?

683
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,776
No, it's not.

684
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:50,746
So where's this going?

685
01:05:53,856 --> 01:05:56,516
What do you want from me?

686
01:05:58,856 --> 01:06:02,586
Say, "what do you want
from me, Catherine?"

687
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:07,526
What the fuck do you
want from me, Catherine?

688
01:06:14,406 --> 01:06:16,496
Brought you something.

689
01:06:20,816 --> 01:06:25,646
Aren't you going
to say thank-you?

690
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:28,986
- What's it about?
- It's about a boy who kills his parents.

691
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:32,046
They have a play, and he
makes it look like an accident.

692
01:06:35,396 --> 01:06:36,556
Why did he do that?

693
01:06:38,426 --> 01:06:41,056
To see if he could
get away with it.

694
01:06:43,806 --> 01:06:45,466
When did you write this?

695
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:49,476
You mean, did I write it
before my parents died?

696
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:57,076
No. I wrote it years afterwards.

697
01:06:58,816 --> 01:07:02,516
You wont stop following me around
now just because you're on leave?

698
01:07:02,556 --> 01:07:03,856
Absolutely not.

699
01:07:05,756 --> 01:07:07,656
Good, I'd miss you.

700
01:07:07,726 --> 01:07:09,885
You could get in trouble.
You're not really a cop anymore.

701
01:07:09,886 --> 01:07:13,056
- I'll risk it.
- Why take the risk?

702
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:16,336
To see if I can
get away with it.

703
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:22,036
- How's your new book?
- Practically writing itself.

704
01:07:23,376 --> 01:07:26,576
I'll be leaving about midnight,
in case you are going to follow me.

705
01:07:28,676 --> 01:07:32,846
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.
- I'll meet you there.

706
01:07:34,486 --> 01:07:36,416
Hi, Gus.

707
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:55,666
Forgive me for asking, and I don't
mean to belabor the obvious...

708
01:07:55,706 --> 01:07:59,736
but why've you got your
head so far up your ass?

709
01:07:59,816 --> 01:08:02,836
She wants to play.
Fine, I can play.

710
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:06,816
Everybody she plays with dies.

711
01:08:07,886 --> 01:08:10,476
I know what that's like.

712
01:09:04,906 --> 01:09:06,876
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

713
01:16:39,496 --> 01:16:42,466
If you don't leave her
alone, I'll kill you.

714
01:16:48,536 --> 01:16:50,806
Let me ask you
something, "Rocky."

715
01:16:52,546 --> 01:16:53,976
Man to man.

716
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:59,046
I think she's the
fuck of the century.

717
01:17:02,926 --> 01:17:04,916
What do you think?

718
01:17:09,426 --> 01:17:10,956
How long you been here?

719
01:17:12,596 --> 01:17:15,496
You like watching, don't you?

720
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:20,966
She likes me to watch.

721
01:18:05,586 --> 01:18:07,556
Oh, God.

722
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,586
<i><font color=#66CCCC>The beach C</font></i>

723
01:18:57,606 --> 01:18:59,536
Good morning.

724
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:02,936
I guess Roxy's not
taking this too well.

725
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:06,966
She's seen me fuck
plenty of guys.

726
01:19:07,016 --> 01:19:11,846
Well, maybe she saw something
she's never seen before.

727
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:13,616
She's seen everything before.

728
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:17,056
Honey, I thought I'd
seen everything before.

729
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:19,686
Did you really think
it was so special?

730
01:19:19,896 --> 01:19:23,556
I told her I thought it
was the fuck of the century.

731
01:19:28,636 --> 01:19:30,366
What do you think?

732
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:34,426
I thought it was a
pretty good beginning.

733
01:19:38,346 --> 01:19:39,606
What about Roxy?

734
01:19:39,676 --> 01:19:41,946
Is she more fun?

735
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:44,946
Would you like her
to join us sometime?

736
01:19:45,016 --> 01:19:49,746
- Did she join you and Johnny?
- No, he felt intimidated.

737
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:52,016
Look what happened to him.

738
01:19:52,086 --> 01:19:54,996
Tell me, were you
frightened last night?

739
01:19:55,026 --> 01:19:56,586
That's the point, wasn't it?

740
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,656
That's what made it so good.

741
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:04,026
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.

742
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:05,506
You're in over your head.

743
01:20:05,536 --> 01:20:09,496
Maybe, but this is how
I'll catch my killer.

744
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:18,975
I'm not going to confess all my
secrets just because I have an orgasm.

745
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,676
You won't learn anything
I don't want you to know.

746
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:26,015
Yes, I will. Then I'll nail you.

747
01:20:26,016 --> 01:20:29,656
You'll just fall
in love with me.

748
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,716
I'm in love with you already.

749
01:20:35,566 --> 01:20:37,766
But I'll nail you anyway.

750
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:41,496
You can put that in your book.

751
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:46,976
<i>No</i>

752
01:20:47,016 --> 01:20:50,966
<i>Not that bar again</i>

753
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:55,816
<i>Oh, I want to
know you're the one</i>

754
01:20:55,986 --> 01:20:59,146
<i>And I don't mean
the one I regret</i>

755
01:21:01,596 --> 01:21:03,496
<i>The heart's still going</i>

756
01:21:03,566 --> 01:21:06,656
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Where the fuck you been?

757
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:10,536
- I've been over to your place.
- Easy, cowboy, easy.

758
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:15,576
- I wasn't there.
- I went over last night too.

759
01:21:16,646 --> 01:21:18,806
Well, I wasn't there either.

760
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:26,116
You fucked her.

761
01:21:26,976 --> 01:21:30,015
God damned, dumb son of a bitch!

762
01:21:30,016 --> 01:21:32,516
You fucked her!

763
01:21:32,586 --> 01:21:34,686
God damn! You are one...

764
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:36,746
dumb son of a bitch!

765
01:21:36,796 --> 01:21:37,985
Next time, I'll use a rubber.

766
01:21:37,986 --> 01:21:42,796
I don't give a flying,
chili bean fart about that!

767
01:21:42,866 --> 01:21:45,836
- How about it, Harry. How much?
- Thirty-two.

768
01:21:46,006 --> 01:21:48,566
I'm worried about him,
he's worried about rubbers.

769
01:21:48,636 --> 01:21:50,536
You really gotta
protect yourself.

770
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:53,136
What in the hell for?

771
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:58,676
You think I'm getting any? Sure, I
can get laid by blue haired women!

772
01:21:58,746 --> 01:22:02,446
- I don't like them!
- Don't knock it 'til you tried it!

773
01:22:08,596 --> 01:22:09,686
Feeling better?

774
01:22:09,726 --> 01:22:12,666
I feel fine.

775
01:22:12,696 --> 01:22:13,856
How could you fuck her?

776
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:16,836
Come on.

777
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:22,866
You want to die, Hoss?

778
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:25,046
What is it? Those tourists?

779
01:22:26,516 --> 01:22:30,846
You still so bad about that, you're
wiggling your way into an ice pick?

780
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:34,045
Got too many, god damn
tourists coming here anyway!

781
01:22:34,046 --> 01:22:37,916
- Hold it down.
- Plenty more where they came from!

782
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,596
I'm not afraid of her.

783
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:50,866
Why the hell not?

784
01:22:53,736 --> 01:22:55,706
I don't know.

785
01:22:55,736 --> 01:22:56,896
I'm just not.

786
01:22:57,106 --> 01:22:59,596
That's her pussy talking!
It ain't your brain!

787
01:22:59,676 --> 01:23:01,906
Come on.

788
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:14,656
I.A. Did a track on Lieutenant
Martin D-for-dickhead Nilsen.

789
01:23:14,726 --> 01:23:17,886
They found a safety deposit
box with $50,000 in it...

790
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:21,126
taken out three months
ago and not used since.

791
01:23:22,766 --> 01:23:25,935
That doesn't make any sense. She
didn't know me three months ago.

792
01:23:25,936 --> 01:23:27,866
Maybe it wasn't
her that paid him.

793
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:30,776
Maybe the money was for something
else. How the fuck do I know?

794
01:23:33,936 --> 01:23:39,406
I'm just an old city cowboy trying
not to fall out of his saddle.

795
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:55,895
- All right, cowboy?
- Yeah.

796
01:23:55,896 --> 01:23:57,895
Come on. I'm going
to drive you home.

797
01:23:57,896 --> 01:24:00,596
In that little
piss-ant car of yours?

798
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:04,696
Hell, no. I ain't getting no
back pain disability retirement.

799
01:24:04,776 --> 01:24:09,836
I'm gonna get a full pension and
a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

800
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:11,515
I'm driving you...

801
01:24:11,516 --> 01:24:13,716
You're not driving
my Cadillac car!

802
01:24:13,786 --> 01:24:18,656
I won't let no head-up-his-ass
person drive my Cadillac car!

803
01:24:18,726 --> 01:24:19,886
So long!

804
01:26:19,846 --> 01:26:21,816
You wanna play? Come on!

805
01:27:32,546 --> 01:27:34,676
Lieutenant! I got
the information.

806
01:27:34,756 --> 01:27:36,725
Get it down here!

807
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:39,055
You signed your name
to this crock of shit?

808
01:27:39,056 --> 01:27:40,716
Why not? It was an accident.

809
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:44,786
"Your driving around North Beach and
this car won't get out of the way."

810
01:27:44,866 --> 01:27:46,726
I don't think she meant
to go off the edge.

811
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:49,566
- Could we have him for a minute?
- No, you can't!

812
01:27:49,596 --> 01:27:53,556
Don't fuck with me on this. I don't
need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

813
01:27:53,636 --> 01:27:56,866
Full name is Roxanne Hardy. Last
known address, Cloverdale, California.

814
01:27:56,906 --> 01:27:58,896
No priors, no convictions.

815
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:02,136
Car is registered
to Catherine Trammel.

816
01:28:02,346 --> 01:28:04,336
- You knew her!
- I met her at Trammel's house.

817
01:28:04,386 --> 01:28:05,846
All I did was
write her name down.

818
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:09,006
You wrote her name down
and then big surprise...

819
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:11,746
she rolls her car
down a hill and dies.

820
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:15,686
- Is that what you're telling me?
- That's all I know.

821
01:28:15,726 --> 01:28:18,816
You know what then? Fuck you!

822
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,812
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office...
- I told you to stay away from Trammel!

823
01:28:23,836 --> 01:28:25,596
You didn't tell me to
stay away from the car!

824
01:28:25,636 --> 01:28:29,936
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office!
- Who are you selling my file to now?

825
01:28:31,676 --> 01:28:34,836
You are out of control,
Curran. You hear me?

826
01:28:44,156 --> 01:28:47,056
Hello, Nick. This
is Dr. Myron...

827
01:28:47,126 --> 01:28:49,056
and Dr. McElwaine.

828
01:28:50,696 --> 01:28:55,566
They've been asked to consult with
me on this psychiatric evaluation.

829
01:28:55,736 --> 01:28:57,526
Sit down.

830
01:29:04,546 --> 01:29:07,976
We understand you're having difficulty
controlling your temper lately.

831
01:29:08,046 --> 01:29:10,776
Only in regard to one person.

832
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:15,716
Do you think Lieutenant
Nilsen deserved to die?

833
01:29:16,886 --> 01:29:18,826
I didn't know him well enough.

834
01:29:18,856 --> 01:29:20,086
I won't miss him.

835
01:29:22,896 --> 01:29:25,756
When you recollect
your childhood...

836
01:29:25,826 --> 01:29:28,456
are your recollections
pleasing to you?

837
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:35,876
Number one: I don't remember how
often I jerked off, but it was a lot.

838
01:29:35,906 --> 01:29:38,136
Number two: I wasn't
pissed off at my dad...

839
01:29:38,476 --> 01:29:41,122
even when I was old enough to know
what he and mom did in the bedroom.

840
01:29:41,146 --> 01:29:44,476
Number three: I don't look
in the toilet before I flush.

841
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:47,886
Number four: I haven't
wet my bed for a long time.

842
01:29:47,956 --> 01:29:50,076
Number five...

843
01:29:50,156 --> 01:29:52,556
why don't the two of
you go fuck yourselves.

844
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:54,556
I'm out of here.

845
01:30:01,966 --> 01:30:03,956
What's your problem?
I'm trying to help.

846
01:30:04,036 --> 01:30:05,912
- Why won't you let me?
- I don't want your help!

847
01:30:05,936 --> 01:30:07,836
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do!

848
01:30:07,906 --> 01:30:09,896
Something's going on.

849
01:30:09,976 --> 01:30:11,996
You're sleeping
with her, aren't you?

850
01:30:12,046 --> 01:30:16,006
- Why are you interested in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.

851
01:30:16,046 --> 01:30:18,016
She seduces and
manipulates people.

852
01:30:18,086 --> 01:30:20,776
- She'll do anything she can...
- I thought you hardly knew her?

853
01:30:20,856 --> 01:30:23,146
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
- That means...

854
01:30:23,486 --> 01:30:25,976
you manipulate people too!

855
01:30:26,056 --> 01:30:28,146
You're a practicing
psychologist.

856
01:30:28,526 --> 01:30:30,586
You're better at it than she is!

857
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:35,096
I feel sorry for you!

858
01:31:32,526 --> 01:31:34,546
I should have known.

859
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:41,156
I came in to the house.

860
01:31:41,236 --> 01:31:43,096
When we were down
on the beach...

861
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:47,526
she looked at me so strangely.

862
01:31:50,036 --> 01:31:52,206
She left right after you.

863
01:31:56,946 --> 01:31:58,936
I...

864
01:31:59,986 --> 01:32:03,046
I shouldn't have
let her watch us.

865
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:07,646
She wanted to watch
me all the time.

866
01:32:14,066 --> 01:32:18,156
She tried to kill
you, didn't she?

867
01:32:18,506 --> 01:32:22,696
- Did you like her to watch you?
- You think I told her to kill you?

868
01:32:22,906 --> 01:32:24,706
No.

869
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:31,616
Everybody that I care about...

870
01:32:31,686 --> 01:32:33,646
dies.

871
01:32:53,136 --> 01:32:55,076
Make love to me.

872
01:33:14,626 --> 01:33:18,586
You think she killed Johnny Boz?

873
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:21,686
For what, to set me up?

874
01:33:21,766 --> 01:33:24,136
She loved me. She
wouldn't frame me.

875
01:33:25,136 --> 01:33:29,506
- Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.
- No, she didn't.

876
01:33:29,576 --> 01:33:32,546
She'd never get jealous before.

877
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:34,596
She got excited.

878
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:40,616
I don't have luck with women.

879
01:33:42,086 --> 01:33:44,216
There was this girl...

880
01:33:44,556 --> 01:33:47,026
I met when I was in college.

881
01:33:47,056 --> 01:33:48,616
I slept with her once.

882
01:33:48,696 --> 01:33:53,186
She started following me
around, taking my picture.

883
01:33:53,566 --> 01:33:57,696
She dyed her hair,
copied my clothes.

884
01:33:57,766 --> 01:33:59,736
Lisa...

885
01:34:00,776 --> 01:34:02,706
something, Oberman.

886
01:34:06,776 --> 01:34:08,766
It was awful.

887
01:34:10,786 --> 01:34:12,776
I thought you didn't
make confessions.

888
01:34:17,086 --> 01:34:19,116
I never did before.

889
01:34:29,536 --> 01:34:30,696
Another nice girl.

890
01:34:49,686 --> 01:34:51,156
How old was she
when it happened?

891
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,176
Sixteen.

892
01:34:53,526 --> 01:34:55,786
We seal juvenile records
until they're deceased.

893
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:57,796
That's why you couldn't
find it in your computer.

894
01:34:57,866 --> 01:35:00,656
What was the motive?

895
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:03,636
She said she didn't know.
Just sort of did it on impulse.

896
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:07,656
The razor just happened to be
there. That's what she said.

897
01:35:13,176 --> 01:35:17,116
- Help yourself to some coffee.
- Thanks.

898
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:20,116
I don't understand what
the hell is going on here.

899
01:35:20,146 --> 01:35:22,646
It ain't hard, Hoss.
This young farm girl...

900
01:35:22,686 --> 01:35:26,056
got tired of all that attention
going to her little brothers...

901
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:28,186
so she fixed them.

902
01:35:28,526 --> 01:35:31,516
Just like old Hazel Dobkins
fixed her whole family.

903
01:35:31,566 --> 01:35:34,126
Except young Roxy, here,
didn't use a wedding present.

904
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:36,796
She used daddy's razor.

905
01:35:45,776 --> 01:35:47,676
Sure makes you wonder
what they talk about...

906
01:35:47,746 --> 01:35:50,736
when they sit in front
of the camp-fire at night.

907
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:54,186
You ever met a friend of hers
that hasn't killed somebody?

908
01:35:54,216 --> 01:35:57,215
Must of beat your ordinary,
every day girl talk.

909
01:35:57,216 --> 01:35:59,816
I'm not sure,
anymore, she did it.

910
01:35:59,856 --> 01:36:01,916
Which one we talking about now?

911
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:05,186
We know Hazel did it. We
know young Roxy did it.

912
01:36:05,566 --> 01:36:06,756
And the other one...

913
01:36:06,796 --> 01:36:12,136
She's got that magna cum laude
pussy that fried up your brain.

914
01:36:31,256 --> 01:36:33,816
"Oberman, Mark W., Donald M."

915
01:36:34,896 --> 01:36:36,256
Sorry, no "Lisa."

916
01:36:36,556 --> 01:36:38,996
You sure about the year?

917
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:42,156
Catherine Tramell
graduated in '83.

918
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:45,966
She said Lisa Oberman
was here at the same time.

919
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:50,536
Yeah, we have Tramell.

920
01:36:53,976 --> 01:36:55,566
But no Lisa Oberman.

921
01:36:55,616 --> 01:36:57,946
Are you sure? There
can't be a mistake?

922
01:36:59,746 --> 01:37:02,146
Only if you're
making it, Detective.

923
01:37:16,736 --> 01:37:19,536
Hazel, this is Nick. I
told you all about him.

924
01:37:19,566 --> 01:37:21,596
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.

925
01:37:21,676 --> 01:37:23,726
You're the shooter, aren't you?

926
01:37:23,806 --> 01:37:25,776
How are you?

927
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:28,606
Fine, thank you. Can I
speak to you for a minute?

928
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:32,976
Would you wait for me in
the car? I'll be right there.

929
01:37:34,186 --> 01:37:35,986
Good-bye, shooter.

930
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:40,586
You like to hang out
with murderers, or what?

931
01:37:40,656 --> 01:37:43,716
- You know that Roxy was involved...
- Yes, of course, I knew.

932
01:37:43,796 --> 01:37:46,726
I write about unusual people, and
sometimes when I do my research...

933
01:37:46,766 --> 01:37:49,026
I get involved with them.

934
01:37:49,066 --> 01:37:51,656
It happened with you.

935
01:37:52,836 --> 01:37:55,736
Killing isn't like smoking.

936
01:37:55,776 --> 01:37:57,966
You can quit.

937
01:38:00,246 --> 01:38:02,676
I gotta go.

938
01:38:03,876 --> 01:38:05,906
I promised I'd get
her home by 6:00.

939
01:38:05,986 --> 01:38:08,776
She just loves
"America's Most Wanted."

940
01:38:08,816 --> 01:38:12,586
There was no Lisa Oberman
when you were at Berkeley.

941
01:38:12,626 --> 01:38:15,816
What are you doing?
Checking up on me?

942
01:38:15,856 --> 01:38:18,916
For what? I said "Hoberman."

943
01:38:21,766 --> 01:38:25,706
"Hoberman." Lisa
Hoberman, with an H.

944
01:38:27,066 --> 01:38:29,036
You do?

945
01:38:31,046 --> 01:38:33,906
All right. Thank you very much.

946
01:38:35,876 --> 01:38:39,786
You know I can get my
butt kicked for this.

947
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:42,016
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- Come on, Sam.

948
01:38:42,086 --> 01:38:44,816
- This is only gonna take a minute.
- Yeah.

949
01:38:53,726 --> 01:38:55,626
Bring it up.

950
01:38:58,006 --> 01:39:00,696
That's Dr. Garner, isn't it?

951
01:39:02,676 --> 01:39:05,006
Bring up '83.

952
01:39:22,026 --> 01:39:24,016
You shouldn't leave
your door open.

953
01:39:26,066 --> 01:39:28,996
I didn't. There's something
wrong with my lock.

954
01:39:29,066 --> 01:39:30,656
What do you want?

955
01:39:30,696 --> 01:39:31,856
Tell me about Catherine.

956
01:39:34,776 --> 01:39:37,536
She told you, didn't she?

957
01:39:37,576 --> 01:39:40,066
What did she tell me?

958
01:39:42,916 --> 01:39:45,746
I slept with her once in school.

959
01:39:45,786 --> 01:39:48,976
I was just a kid.
I was experimenting.

960
01:39:49,056 --> 01:39:52,616
It was just that one time.

961
01:39:52,686 --> 01:39:55,126
She developed a fixation on me.

962
01:39:55,596 --> 01:39:58,656
She styled her hair like mine, wore
the same kind of clothes as I did.

963
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:00,716
It scared me.

964
01:40:03,736 --> 01:40:06,666
Isn't that what she told you?

965
01:40:06,736 --> 01:40:09,075
She said it was you.

966
01:40:09,076 --> 01:40:11,066
You dressed like her. You
dyed your hair blonde...

967
01:40:11,146 --> 01:40:13,136
I did dye my hair. It had
nothing to do with her.

968
01:40:13,176 --> 01:40:15,946
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

969
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:18,136
- I had him for two classes.
- You saw all the reports.

970
01:40:18,616 --> 01:40:19,962
Phil copied you. You
never said anything!

971
01:40:19,986 --> 01:40:21,776
What am I supposed to say?

972
01:40:21,816 --> 01:40:25,086
"I'm not gay, but I
did fuck your suspect"?

973
01:40:26,986 --> 01:40:31,926
I was embarrassed. It was the
only time I'd been with a woman.

974
01:40:33,726 --> 01:40:35,786
She's really sick, you know.

975
01:40:35,866 --> 01:40:37,696
Do you know what she's doing?

976
01:40:37,736 --> 01:40:40,866
She knows I went to Berkeley.
She knows I knew Noah.

977
01:40:40,936 --> 01:40:42,906
She makes up this
story about me.

978
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:45,636
She's handing you somebody
who's obsessed with her.

979
01:40:45,676 --> 01:40:47,722
She didn't hand you to me.
She doesn't know who you are.

980
01:40:47,746 --> 01:40:49,146
You told me about
a Lisa Hoberman.

981
01:40:49,616 --> 01:40:52,776
She knows you'd find out who
Lisa is. You're a good cop.

982
01:40:53,986 --> 01:40:55,956
She tell you casually?

983
01:40:56,016 --> 01:40:58,076
Make it seem irrelevant?

984
01:40:59,886 --> 01:41:01,876
Did she tell you in bed?

985
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:07,656
That's what I'd do.

986
01:41:09,996 --> 01:41:11,936
Why'd you change your name?

987
01:41:11,966 --> 01:41:14,936
I got married. He
called me "Beth."

988
01:41:15,006 --> 01:41:17,566
He was on staff at
the clinic in Salinas.

989
01:41:17,646 --> 01:41:19,836
Didn't last long.

990
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:25,846
Do you really think that
I could kill someone?

991
01:41:25,916 --> 01:41:27,816
I never even met Johnny Boz!

992
01:41:27,856 --> 01:41:31,146
And what about Nilsen? What
motive would I have to kill him?

993
01:41:31,626 --> 01:41:34,116
- You should get that lock fixed.
- God...

994
01:41:34,156 --> 01:41:37,856
She's evil! She's brilliant!

995
01:42:02,816 --> 01:42:05,155
Did I scare you?

996
01:42:05,156 --> 01:42:07,746
I wanted to surprise you.

997
01:42:07,826 --> 01:42:10,756
- What's wrong?
- I found Lisa Hoberman.

998
01:42:10,826 --> 01:42:12,816
Oh, you did? What's she doing?

999
01:42:16,066 --> 01:42:18,896
You're not going to
tell me what she's doing.

1000
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:22,136
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.

1001
01:42:22,606 --> 01:42:24,096
She said you got it backwards.

1002
01:42:24,136 --> 01:42:26,976
She said you styled
your hair like she did.

1003
01:42:27,046 --> 01:42:29,066
And you believed her.

1004
01:42:30,146 --> 01:42:35,946
I had to go to the campus police
and file a report about her.

1005
01:42:35,986 --> 01:42:39,846
- I suppose you still think I kill people too?
- No.

1006
01:42:43,826 --> 01:42:45,726
Liar.

1007
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:52,966
- Who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide, San Francisco.

1008
01:42:55,736 --> 01:42:57,836
Here we go.

1009
01:42:57,906 --> 01:42:59,876
Kind of.

1010
01:42:59,906 --> 01:43:02,436
There was a report about
Lisa Hoberman, January, 1980.

1011
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:05,036
- But it's out of here.
- Who's got it?

1012
01:43:06,116 --> 01:43:08,106
One of your guys. Nilsen.

1013
01:43:08,486 --> 01:43:10,746
- You know him?
- Yeah.

1014
01:43:10,816 --> 01:43:12,986
Thanks a lot.

1015
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:15,956
Tell him to bring it back.
He's had it a whole year.

1016
01:43:16,496 --> 01:43:19,486
So Nilsen had a report on Beth.
You don't know what was in it.

1017
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:22,042
- Catherine told me what was in it.
- If she's telling you the truth.

1018
01:43:22,066 --> 01:43:23,826
Gus, don't you get it?

1019
01:43:23,896 --> 01:43:25,896
If Beth killed Johnny
Boz to frame Catherine...

1020
01:43:25,936 --> 01:43:27,912
she wouldn't want anybody to
know what happened in Berkeley!

1021
01:43:27,936 --> 01:43:30,996
But Nilsen found out about it. That
gives her the motive to kill him.

1022
01:43:31,076 --> 01:43:34,046
How did she know Nilsen
found out, if it happened?

1023
01:43:34,106 --> 01:43:36,506
He probably asked her!

1024
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:39,076
She'd have to be nuttier
than a 20 pound fruitcake!

1025
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:42,016
She's not the one who hangs
out with multiple murderers!

1026
01:43:42,056 --> 01:43:44,716
- You're girlfriend is!
- She's a writer! That's her job!

1027
01:43:44,786 --> 01:43:47,886
I don't buy it. There must be somebody
at Berkeley who knows what happened!

1028
01:43:47,956 --> 01:43:49,896
I know what happened!
Catherine told me!

1029
01:43:49,956 --> 01:43:53,016
- Everything she says has checked out!
- You got tweety birds...

1030
01:43:53,096 --> 01:43:55,126
fluttering around in your head!

1031
01:43:55,196 --> 01:43:57,526
You think you can fuck like
minks, raise rug rats...

1032
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,696
and live happily ever after?

1033
01:43:59,736 --> 01:44:01,706
Oh, man!

1034
01:44:13,786 --> 01:44:16,146
How'd you get in here?

1035
01:44:16,186 --> 01:44:18,056
What's this?

1036
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:21,186
I decided to give
you a second chance.

1037
01:44:21,526 --> 01:44:25,586
- I missed you.
- I wasn't gone long enough.

1038
01:44:25,766 --> 01:44:27,786
Did you miss me?

1039
01:44:27,866 --> 01:44:29,796
No.

1040
01:44:39,776 --> 01:44:43,606
Why don't you come over
here and tell me no.

1041
01:44:46,586 --> 01:44:48,776
- I've seen them before.
- Yeah?

1042
01:44:48,816 --> 01:44:51,616
Well, you might
not see them again.

1043
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,816
My book's nearly finished.

1044
01:44:53,856 --> 01:44:56,086
My detective's almost dead.

1045
01:44:56,156 --> 01:44:57,956
So I've got time
for a last cigarette?

1046
01:44:58,026 --> 01:44:59,186
Afterwards.

1047
01:45:12,106 --> 01:45:14,876
I've got to do some
research tomorrow morning.

1048
01:45:14,946 --> 01:45:17,916
I'm good at research.
I'll help you.

1049
01:45:17,946 --> 01:45:19,816
No, thanks.

1050
01:45:19,886 --> 01:45:21,976
What are you researching?

1051
01:45:22,056 --> 01:45:23,606
Oh...

1052
01:45:23,816 --> 01:45:26,156
a new ending to your book.

1053
01:45:26,526 --> 01:45:29,516
Oh, really? What's the twist?

1054
01:45:29,596 --> 01:45:33,556
The detective falls
for the wrong girl.

1055
01:45:33,596 --> 01:45:36,126
But he doesn't die.

1056
01:45:38,006 --> 01:45:40,996
So what happens to him?

1057
01:45:42,106 --> 01:45:45,596
They fuck like minks,
raise rug rats...

1058
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:47,606
and live happily ever after.

1059
01:45:49,116 --> 01:45:51,046
It won't sell.

1060
01:45:52,146 --> 01:45:53,586
Why not?

1061
01:45:55,216 --> 01:45:57,846
Somebody has to die.

1062
01:46:00,526 --> 01:46:01,986
Why?

1063
01:46:03,126 --> 01:46:06,156
Somebody always does.

1064
01:46:23,116 --> 01:46:25,576
Morning. I'm looking
for a Dr. Garner.

1065
01:46:25,616 --> 01:46:29,146
She doesn't work here anymore. She's
in San Francisco with the police.

1066
01:46:29,186 --> 01:46:30,946
Actually, I'm looking
for her husband.

1067
01:46:30,986 --> 01:46:34,146
- He works here too, doesn't he?
- Dr. Joseph Garner?

1068
01:46:34,186 --> 01:46:36,086
- She married?
- You know him?

1069
01:46:36,126 --> 01:46:39,026
He died about five
or six years ago.

1070
01:46:39,066 --> 01:46:42,996
- How did he die?
- He was shot.

1071
01:46:45,066 --> 01:46:47,126
Thank you.

1072
01:46:47,206 --> 01:46:51,076
He was walking home from work.

1073
01:46:51,136 --> 01:46:53,636
He only lived a couple
of blocks from the clinic.

1074
01:46:53,676 --> 01:46:55,106
Somebody just drove
by and shot him.

1075
01:46:55,176 --> 01:46:58,976
- What was the murder weapon?
- Revolver, .38. Unrecovered.

1076
01:46:59,046 --> 01:47:01,676
- Watch yourself.
- Were there any suspects?

1077
01:47:01,716 --> 01:47:05,116
No suspects, no
motive. Unsolved.

1078
01:47:05,156 --> 01:47:07,646
Was his wife ever a suspect?

1079
01:47:09,126 --> 01:47:12,156
One of your guys was down
here from Frisco a year ago.

1080
01:47:12,496 --> 01:47:14,726
He was asking the
same, exact thing.

1081
01:47:14,936 --> 01:47:16,696
You mind telling
me what's going on?

1082
01:47:16,896 --> 01:47:19,526
Routine.

1083
01:47:19,606 --> 01:47:21,575
That's exactly what he said.

1084
01:47:21,576 --> 01:47:24,575
Now I got two of you guys
telling me it's "routine."

1085
01:47:24,576 --> 01:47:26,906
You remember what the
other guy's name was?

1086
01:47:28,046 --> 01:47:32,106
No. I can't really
say that I do.

1087
01:47:32,146 --> 01:47:34,916
Nilsen?

1088
01:47:34,986 --> 01:47:36,916
Yeah. That was it.

1089
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:42,026
- So was she ever a suspect?
- No.

1090
01:47:43,096 --> 01:47:44,586
There was some talk.

1091
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:46,656
But it never panned out.

1092
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:49,696
- What kind of talk?
- Girlfriend.

1093
01:47:49,896 --> 01:47:51,996
He had a girlfriend?

1094
01:47:52,066 --> 01:47:53,536
No.

1095
01:47:55,176 --> 01:47:57,006
She did.

1096
01:47:59,076 --> 01:48:02,536
But like I said,
it never panned out.

1097
01:48:04,616 --> 01:48:07,106
- Thank you.
- Hope that helped you out.

1098
01:48:07,486 --> 01:48:11,616
Yes, you did. You sure did.

1099
01:48:41,786 --> 01:48:43,046
I missed you.

1100
01:48:45,226 --> 01:48:46,586
I finished my research.

1101
01:48:46,656 --> 01:48:50,026
- I finished my book.
- So how does it end?

1102
01:48:51,096 --> 01:48:53,066
I told you.

1103
01:48:53,126 --> 01:48:55,066
She kills him.

1104
01:48:57,736 --> 01:48:59,826
Good-bye, Nick.

1105
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:03,626
Good-bye?

1106
01:49:03,706 --> 01:49:06,606
Yeah. I finished my book.

1107
01:49:09,076 --> 01:49:11,136
Didn't you hear me?

1108
01:49:11,216 --> 01:49:13,046
Your character's dead.

1109
01:49:14,856 --> 01:49:16,476
Good-bye.

1110
01:49:20,756 --> 01:49:22,816
What do you want, flowers?

1111
01:49:22,856 --> 01:49:25,156
I'll send you an
autographed copy.

1112
01:49:27,126 --> 01:49:29,726
What is this, some kind of joke?

1113
01:49:34,566 --> 01:49:35,766
You playing a game here?

1114
01:49:36,876 --> 01:49:38,806
The games are over.

1115
01:49:40,576 --> 01:49:42,046
You were right.

1116
01:49:42,116 --> 01:49:46,546
It was the fuck of
the century, shooter.

1117
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:01,226
I'll be right there.

1118
01:50:28,826 --> 01:50:30,796
Catherine Tramell's
roommate, freshman year?

1119
01:50:30,826 --> 01:50:34,786
I just got a call from her.
She's in Oakland. Come on!

1120
01:50:36,896 --> 01:50:38,886
I've been phoning people
from her dorm all day.

1121
01:50:39,106 --> 01:50:40,782
She must've heard I
was trying to reach her.

1122
01:50:40,806 --> 01:50:44,796
Says she knows all about
Catherine and Lisa Hoberman.

1123
01:50:47,176 --> 01:50:48,736
You feeling okay?

1124
01:50:50,776 --> 01:50:52,246
Here's something else.

1125
01:50:52,586 --> 01:50:55,846
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
has an office on Van Ness.

1126
01:50:55,916 --> 01:50:57,786
Guess who he shares space with?

1127
01:50:57,816 --> 01:51:00,656
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1128
01:51:03,226 --> 01:51:06,786
What in the hell's
the matter with you?

1129
01:51:19,776 --> 01:51:22,806
I'll be in suite 405.

1130
01:51:24,816 --> 01:51:27,146
- Where the hell you going?
- I'm going with you.

1131
01:51:27,216 --> 01:51:29,155
You're on leave, Hoss.

1132
01:51:29,156 --> 01:51:32,146
It ain't gonna take long.

1133
01:53:54,726 --> 01:53:55,996
Freeze!

1134
01:53:56,066 --> 01:53:57,696
What are you doing here?

1135
01:53:57,766 --> 01:53:59,666
Put your fucking hands up!

1136
01:53:59,736 --> 01:54:01,666
I got a message
to meet Gus here.

1137
01:54:01,736 --> 01:54:03,826
- Where is he?
- Don't you move!

1138
01:54:03,906 --> 01:54:06,706
I know about your husband!
You still like girls, Beth?

1139
01:54:07,746 --> 01:54:11,046
- What?
- Take you hands out of your pocket!

1140
01:54:11,116 --> 01:54:13,706
- Take them out!
- What's wrong with you?

1141
01:54:13,786 --> 01:54:15,076
Take them out!

1142
01:54:34,966 --> 01:54:36,936
I loved you.

1143
01:54:53,186 --> 01:54:55,126
Oh, God!

1144
01:55:18,116 --> 01:55:20,846
What made you
think she had a gun?

1145
01:55:22,616 --> 01:55:26,106
What was she doing here?
What was Gus doing here?

1146
01:55:29,796 --> 01:55:31,726
Lieutenant.

1147
01:55:59,726 --> 01:56:01,056
One of ours.

1148
01:56:03,856 --> 01:56:06,556
Jesus.

1149
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:08,966
We'll have to check
Beth's apartment.

1150
01:56:12,036 --> 01:56:13,766
Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

1151
01:56:13,836 --> 01:56:16,636
In the bookcase,
behind some books.

1152
01:56:18,976 --> 01:56:22,066
Have ballistics
check it for Nilsen.

1153
01:56:22,116 --> 01:56:25,736
Lieutenant. You
better come in here.

1154
01:56:54,046 --> 01:56:56,846
I guess that's it.

1155
01:57:11,996 --> 01:57:16,656
Definitely not. We feel all the
evidence points to Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1156
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:18,686
We checked. It's her size.

1157
01:57:18,766 --> 01:57:20,942
She probably heard you on the
stairway and dumped this stuff.

1158
01:57:20,966 --> 01:57:22,736
There's no suite 405.

1159
01:57:22,806 --> 01:57:24,736
Catherine Tramell's
freshman roommate is dead.

1160
01:57:24,806 --> 01:57:26,746
She died of leukemia
two years ago.

1161
01:57:26,806 --> 01:57:29,436
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- What about Salinas?

1162
01:57:29,646 --> 01:57:32,476
Yeah, hold on. Jack!

1163
01:57:34,016 --> 01:57:36,132
Did you check Nilsen's office
for any files on Beth Garner?

1164
01:57:36,156 --> 01:57:40,016
No police report from Berkeley.
Nothing at all about Salinas.

1165
01:57:40,056 --> 01:57:42,886
I'm back.

1166
01:57:42,926 --> 01:57:44,786
Great.

1167
01:57:44,856 --> 01:57:48,056
Ballistics says the.38 we found in
her apartment was used on Nilsen.

1168
01:57:48,126 --> 01:57:50,656
No registration. They're
checking with Salinas.

1169
01:57:50,696 --> 01:57:53,496
The ice pick was the same brand
and model as the Boz weapon.

1170
01:57:53,706 --> 01:57:55,982
Checked the tape machines at Dr.
Garner's apartment and office...

1171
01:57:56,006 --> 01:57:57,666
both here and the
one on Van Ness.

1172
01:57:57,706 --> 01:57:59,052
There's no message
from Gus on any of them.

1173
01:57:59,076 --> 01:58:01,046
The tape in her
apartment was unused.

1174
01:58:01,106 --> 01:58:03,876
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
says he thinks he remembers...

1175
01:58:03,946 --> 01:58:07,036
Dr. Garner and Boz meeting at
a Christmas party at his house.

1176
01:58:07,116 --> 01:58:09,086
Ayear ago.

1177
01:58:11,986 --> 01:58:15,016
You just can't tell
about people, can you?

1178
01:58:16,796 --> 01:58:21,096
Even the ones you think
you know inside and out.

1179
01:58:24,136 --> 01:58:26,896
Congratulations, Curran.

1180
01:59:26,596 --> 01:59:28,496
I heard about what happened.

1181
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:33,766
On TV.

1182
01:59:44,776 --> 01:59:48,576
I can't allow myself
to care about you.

1183
01:59:51,616 --> 01:59:54,556
I can't allow myself...

1184
01:59:54,586 --> 01:59:57,116
to care.

1185
02:00:00,166 --> 02:00:02,566
I don't want to do this.

1186
02:00:02,636 --> 02:00:05,496
Please. I don't want to do this.

1187
02:00:06,966 --> 02:00:09,806
I lose everybody.

1188
02:00:09,876 --> 02:00:12,806
I don't want to lose you.

1189
02:01:58,176 --> 02:02:00,146
What do we do now?

1190
02:02:01,916 --> 02:02:05,216
Fuck like minks...

1191
02:02:05,556 --> 02:02:08,956
raise rug rats and
live happily ever after.

1192
02:02:20,006 --> 02:02:21,556
I hate rug rats.

1193
02:02:24,576 --> 02:02:27,546
Fuck like minks,
forget the rug rats...

1194
02:02:27,606 --> 02:02:30,576
and live happily ever after.
