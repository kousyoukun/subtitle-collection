1
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,630
这世界已永久改变
The world is changed.

2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,870
我从水中触摸到
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,550
我从土地中感觉到
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,110
我从空气中嗅到
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,430
过去的一切
Much that once was

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,150
都已失落
is lost.

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,910
被世人所遗忘
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,190
这一切都从铸造魔戒开始
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,270
精灵族得到三只戒指
Elves got three ring.

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,260
他们长生不老，也是最有智慧 、最公正的种族
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,390
矮人族分到七只戒指
Dwarves assigned to the seven ring.

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,590
他们擅长挖掘矿坑，是山洞的巧心工匠
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,260
而人类
And nine,

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,510
人类则分到九只戒指
nine rings were gifted to the race of Men,

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,550
他们比别人更贪图权力
who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,870
每只戒指都拥有统治各种族的意志与力量
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,550
但他们都受到欺骗
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,910
因为另外还有一只被铸造了
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,220
魔多

20
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,310
在魔多末日火山的烈焰中
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom,

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,190
黑暗魔君索伦暗地里铸造了可以奴役世界的
the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,430
至尊魔戒
to control all others.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,630
他在魔戒中注入他的邪恶，残酷
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice,

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,030
以及统治天下的可怕欲望
and his will to dominate all life.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,870
一只驾驭一切的至尊魔戒
One Ring to rule them all.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,390
一个接着一个
One by one,

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,270
中土世界的自由之士感受到至尊魔戒的力量
the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,510
但是有些人群起反抗
But there were some who resisted.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,630
人类与精灵组成了最后同盟，携手对抗对抗魔多的邪恶军团
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,470
在险恶的魔多火山下，他们为中土世界的自由而战
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,430
胜利终于在望
Victory was near.

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,950
但是至尊魔戒的力量
But the power of the Ring

33
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,190
却无人能敌
could not be undone.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,710
就在此时
It was in this moment,

35
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,300
正当大家都失去希望之际
when all hope had faded,

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,630
人皇之子埃西铎举起他父亲的宝剑
that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword.

37
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,230
索伦，中土世界自由之民的死敌，终于被击败
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,270
至尊魔戒落入埃西铎手中
The Ring passed to Isildur,

39
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,670
他只有一次机会永恒地摧毁罪恶
who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

40
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,510
但是人心
But the hearts of Men

41
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,220
却很容易受到蛊惑
are easily corrupted.

42
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,110
而且魔戒有它自己的意志
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.

43
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,950
它背叛了埃西铎
It betrayed Isildur

44
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,180
最后将他害死
to his death.

45
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,230
于是那些不应被遗忘的东西
And some things that should not have been forgotten

46
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,790
也逐渐遗失
were lost.

47
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,830
历史成为传说
History became legend,

48
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,030
传说成为神话
legend became myth.

49
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,070
两千五百年来
And for two and a half thousand years,

50
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,990
至尊魔戒的下落无人得知
the Ring passed out of all knowledge.

51
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,470
命运巧妙的安排
Until, when chance came,

52
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,270
让它蛊惑一个新的持有者
it ensnared a new bearer.

53
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,430
我的宝贝
My precious.

54
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,190
至尊魔戒落入咕噜手中
The Ring came to the creature Gollum,

55
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,310
带着这枚戒指，他无声无息的消失在迷雾山脉之中
who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,470
他的身心完全被魔戒占据
And there it consumed him.

57
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,750
它属于我
It came to me.

58
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,350
这是我的，我的爱，我一个人的
My own. My love. My own.

59
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,270
我的宝贝
My precious.

60
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,350
至尊魔戒使咕噜获得违反自然的长寿
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

61
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,390
五百年来它扭曲他的心智
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

62
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,190
而在阴暗潮湿的洞穴之中，它静静的等待着
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

63
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,630
黑暗再度笼罩大地
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

64
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,710
谣传东方聚起邪恶的力量
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East,

65
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,750
人们心中产生无言的恐惧
whispers of a nameless fear.

66
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,230
于是至尊魔戒知道
And the Ring of Power perceived,

67
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,230
它即将再度现身
its time had now come.

68
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,310
它舍弃了咕噜
It abandoned Gollum.

69
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,510
但是出乎意料之外
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.

70
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,910
它被一个料想不到的人捡到
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.

71
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,180
这是什么？
What's this?

72
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,790
一个霍比特人
A Hobbit.

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,750
夏尔的比尔博·巴金斯
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

74
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,710
一只戒指
A ring.

75
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,790
不见了！
Lost!

76
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,030
我的宝贝不见了！
My precious is lost!

77
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,510
不久的将来
For the time will soon come,

78
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,950
霍比特人将决定世界的命运
when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

79
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,750
夏尔纪元
The 22nd day of September,

80
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,150
一四零零年
in the year 1400,

81
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,630
九月第二十二日
by Shire-reckoning.

82
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,590
袋底洞·巴格谢尔街·霍比顿西区
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, Westfarthing,

83
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,790
夏尔
the Shire.

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,830
中土世界
Middle-earth.

85
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,830
第三纪元
The Third Age of this world.

86
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,710
《去而复返·霍比特人的故事》
There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale.

87
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,990
比尔博·巴金斯著
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,590
"《去而复返·霍比特人的故事》  比尔博·巴金斯著"

89
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,430
现在
Now,

90
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,150
我该怎么起头呢？
where to begin?

91
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,470
对了
Ah, yes.

92
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,790
关于
Concerning

93
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,490
霍比特人
Hobbits.

94
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,150
千百年来，霍比特人一直都定居在夏尔的
Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,310
四个大区务农
for many hundreds of years，

96
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,470
他们完全无视于外界的存在
quite content to ignore and be ignored

97
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,870
也满足于被外界忽视的状态
by the world of the Big Folk.

98
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,830
毕竟中土世界充满了数不清的奇异生物
Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count.

99
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,190
霍比特人则显得并不引人注目
Hobbits must seem of little importance,

100
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,430
因为我们既不是骁勇的战士
being neither renowned as great warriors

101
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,790
也不被认为特别有智慧
nor counted among the very wise.

102
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,190
弗罗多，有人在敲门
Frodo! Someone at the door.

103
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,960
事实上，有人曾经评论过
In fact, it has been remarked by some

104
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,550
霍比特人唯一真正热爱的就是美食
that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

105
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,110
这评论相当不公平
A rather unfair observation

106
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,990
因为我们也对酿啤酒
as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales

107
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,150
和抽烟斗有浓厚的兴趣
and the smoking of pipe-weed.

108
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,470
但是真正让我们热爱的
But where our hearts truly lie

109
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,750
还是和平宁静的生活
is in peace and quiet,

110
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,630
与平整肥沃的农耕地
and good, tilled earth.

111
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,990
所有的霍比特人都衷心热爱生长的植物
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

112
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,510
无庸置疑，我们的生活方式对其他人而言非常奇特
And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.

113
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,990
特别是今天
But today of all days,

114
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,430
安享宁谧的生活其实不赖
it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

115
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,630
生日快乐  比尔博·巴金斯

116
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,870
弗罗多，有人在敲门
Frodo! The door!

117
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,900
讨厌
Sticklebacks.

118
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,500
-那孩子跑到哪里去了  -弗罗多
-Where is that boy?   -Frodo!

119
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,830
眼前道路无止尽
Down from the door where it began

120
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,380
蜿蜒崎岖又漫长
And I must follow if I can

121
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,510
虽然路程尚遥远
The road goes ever on and on

122
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,190
眼前道路无止尽
Down from the door where it began

123
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,340
虽然路程尚遥远
Now far ahead the road has gone

124
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,790
-但我一定要继续前进  -你迟到了
-And I must follow if I can  -You're late.

125
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,860
巫师既不会迟到，也不会早到
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

126
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,310
弗罗多·巴金斯，他总是说到就到
Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

127
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,710
见到你真好，甘道夫
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

128
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,300
你不会认为我会错过你伯伯比尔博的生日吧
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo birthday?

129
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,150
那个老家伙还好吗？
How is the old rascal?

130
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,190
听说生日宴会非常盛大
I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.

131
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,820
你也知道比尔博的性子，他把这儿搞得鸡飞狗跳
You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place in an uproar.

132
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,950
这样他应该高兴了
Well, that should please him.

133
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,030
夏尔有一半的人被邀请
Half the Shire's been invited.

134
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,910
另一半也不请自来
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

135
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,390
夏尔的日子就这样继续下去
And so life in the Shire goes on,

136
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,590
跟上个纪元没有什么不同
very much as it has this past Age,

137
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,310
有人来就有人离去，改变很缓慢的进行着
full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly.

138
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,430
如果那真的称得上是什么改变的话
If it comes at all.

139
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,110
夏尔的一切都井然有序
For things are made to endure in the Shire,

140
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,830
一代一代的传承下去
passing from one generation to the next.

141
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,180
巴金斯家族一直都住在
There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill

142
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,750
袋底洞的山丘下
in Bag End.

143
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,310
也会永远住在那里
And there always will be.

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,430
说真的，比尔博最近怪怪的
To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

145
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,870
我是说，比平常更怪
I mean, more than usual.

146
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,870
他常常把自己关在书房里
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

147
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,550
花好几个小时研究那些旧地图，他以为我没看到
He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

148
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,950
它跑到哪儿去了？
Where's it gone?

149
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,870
他好像在搞什么名堂
He's up to something.

150
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,460
-好吧，你不说算了  -什么？
-All right, then. Keep your secrets.  -What?

151
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,430
我知道这一定跟你有关
But I know you have something to do with it.

152
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,710
我可是冤枉的
Good gracious me.

153
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,790
在你出现之前，巴金斯家族的声誉一向都很好
Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.

154
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,020
的确
Indeed.

155
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,540
我们从不冒险或犯规
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.

156
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,990
如果你指的是恶龙，那件事可与我无关
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.

157
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,750
我只是推了你叔叔一把
All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.

158
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,110
不管怎样，你都正式被列为捣乱分子
Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.

159
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,350
真的吗？
Oh, really?

160
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,990
甘道夫，甘道夫！
Gandalf! Gandalf!

161
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,350
放烟火，甘道夫！
Fireworks, Gandalf!

162
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,070
-甘道夫  -放烟火，甘道夫！
-Gandalf!  -Fireworks, Gandalf!

163
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,980
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

164
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,630
-我很高兴你回来了  -我也是，好孩子
-I'm glad you're back.  -So am I, dear boy.

165
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,910
我也是……
So am I.

166
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,510
和宴会无关者，不准进入

167
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,150
不要，多谢了！
No, thank you!

168
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,310
我不欢迎访客，祝寿者或远亲
We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!

169
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,030
如果是一个老朋友呢？
And what about very old friends?

170
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,910
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

171
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,030
-比尔博·巴金斯  -亲爱的甘道夫！
-Bilbo Baggins.  -My dear Gandalf!

172
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,390
见到你真好，111岁大寿，谁会相信？
Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it?

173
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,110
你一点都没老
You haven't aged a day.

174
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,750
请进，快进来吧！
Come on, come in!

175
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,340
欢迎，欢迎
Welcome, welcome.

176
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,080
来吧
Oh, here we are.

177
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,150
喝杯茶，或是小酌两杯？
Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger?

178
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,140
我还有几瓶1296年的陈年好酒
I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

179
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,390
很好的年分，几乎跟我一样老
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

180
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,030
我父亲珍藏的，开一瓶如何？
It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh?

181
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,910
我喝茶就好，谢谢
Just tea, thank you.

182
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,950
你上礼拜就该到了
I was expecting you sometime last week.

183
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,630
其实也没关系，你什么时候来都没关系
Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will.

184
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,870
只是我有点措手不及，家里只有冻鸡和腌黄瓜
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle.

185
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,470
还有乳酪，不行，太寒酸了
There's some cheese here. No, that won't do.

186
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,590
我有覆盆子果酱，苹果馅饼
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart.

187
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,270
但没什么其他可以当甜点的了，噢，不，现在可有了
But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're all right.

188
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,310
我找到一些海绵蛋糕
I've just found some sponge cake.

189
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,710
孤山
<font face="微软雅黑"><font size="15"></b></font><font color="#ffffff">The Lonely Mountain.</font></font>

190
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,550
我可以煮几颗蛋
I could make you some eggs if you'd.

191
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,670
跑到哪儿去了？
Run where were you?

192
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,030
-茶就行了，谢谢  -好吧
-Just tea, thank you.  -Oh, right.

193
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,470
-介意我先吃吗？  -你尽管吃吧
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?  -No, not at all.

194
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,430
比尔博！比尔博·巴金斯！
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

195
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,230
我可不在家！
I'm not at home!

196
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,800
是塞克维尔·巴金斯家的人
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

197
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,150
-我知道你在家  -他们想要这房子
-I know you're in there!  -They're after the house.

198
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,270
我活了这么久，他们还不肯放过我
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

199
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,230
我被这些烦人的亲戚
I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day,

200
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,390
吵得一刻不得安宁
never giving me a moment's peace.

201
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,630
我好想再看看那高耸的山脉,高耸的山脉，甘道夫！
I want to see mountains again. Mountains, Gandalf!

202
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,350
然后找一个安静的地方写写书……噢，茶好了
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

203
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,510
-你真的要实行你的计划吗？  -对，一切都在计划中
-So you mean to go through with your plan?  -Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

204
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,950
我全都安排好了
All the arrangements are made.

205
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,550
噢，谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

206
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,390
佛罗多起了疑心
Frodo suspects something.

207
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,030
当然了，他可是巴金斯家的人
Of course he does. He's a Baggins,

208
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,870
不是布罗克海德家的笨小孩
not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.

209
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,230
你会告诉他吧？
You will tell him, won't you?

210
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,150
-会的  -他很爱你
-Yes, yes.  -He's very fond of you.

211
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,910
我知道
I know.

212
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,590
我开口的话，他一定会跟我去
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

213
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,670
但是我知道，他还是衷心深爱夏尔的家园
I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire.

214
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,550
绿油油的树林和草地
The woods, the fields.

215
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,060
潺潺的溪流
Little rivers.

216
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,270
我老了，甘道夫
I am old, Gandalf.

217
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,870
虽然我看起来并不老，但是我的心老了
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.

218
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,540
我的意志变得很薄弱
I feel thin.

219
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,470
一切感觉起来都索然无味
Sort of stretched,

220
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,070
就像没涂够黄油的面包
like butter scraped over too much bread.

221
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,790
我需要一个假期，一个很长的假期
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

222
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,190
而我并不打算回来
And I don't expect I shall return.

223
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,630
事实上，我打定主意不回来了
In fact, I mean not to.

224
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,390
老托比种的，南区最棒的烟草
Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

225
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,280
甘道夫，我的老朋友
Gandalf, my old friend,

226
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,270
今晚将永生难忘
this will be a night to remember.

227
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,230
你好，你们好
Hello, hello.

228
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,510
小胖博哲，很高兴见到你，欢迎，欢迎
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome, welcome.

229
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,120
山姆，快去邀罗丝跳舞
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

230
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,260
-我还是再喝一杯啤酒吧  -不，你不能喝了
-I think I'll just have another ale.  -Oh, no, you don't.

231
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,110
快去呀！
Go on!

232
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,070
我站在那儿
So there I was

233
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,310
面对三个可怕的食人妖
at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

234
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,550
它们争吵着
And they were all arguing amongst themselves

235
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,110
要怎么把我们煮来吃
about how they were going to cook us.

236
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,380
是一口就把我们给吞了，还是一个接着一个把我们压成肉酱
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

237
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,910
他们喋喋不休吵个没完没了
They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors

238
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,700
直到天边亮起第一丝曙光
that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees

239
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,230
甘道夫把他们都变成了石头！
and turned them all to stone!

240
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,910
快点
Quickly.

241
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,110
飞走喽！
Up they go!

242
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,190
不，拿最大的那个！
No, the big one!

243
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,230
布雷斯太太，真高兴看到你，欢迎，欢迎
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome, welcome.

244
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,310
这些都是你的孩子吗
Are all these children yours?

245
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,510
天啊，你还真能生
Good gracious, you have been productive.

246
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,830
比尔博？
Bilbo?

247
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,270
是塞克维尔·巴金斯！
Sackville-Bagginses!

248
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,540
快，快躲起来！
Quickly, hide!

249
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,670
孩子，谢谢你
Thank you, my boy.

250
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,510
你是个好小伙子，弗罗多
You're a good lad, Frodo.

251
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,590
我一直都很自私
I'm very selfish, you know.

252
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,510
是的，一直都自私自利
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

253
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,950
我不知道为什么，当你父母去世后我会想收养你
I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died,

254
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,670
但那不是因为我想做善事
but it wasn't out of charity.

255
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,670
我想也许那是因为
I think it was because

256
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,230
在我那么多的亲戚当中
of all my numerous relations,

257
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,030
你是最富有冒险精神的人
you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

258
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,020
-比尔博，你偷偷喝酒了吗？  -没有
-Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?  -No.

259
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,910
好吧，我喝了，但那不是重点
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

260
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,390
重点是，弗罗多
The point is, Frodo,

261
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,470
一切都会好起来的
you'll be all right.

262
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,910
-好！  -你居然把他插在地上？
-Done!  -You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

263
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,590
-就应该插在地上呀  -那也应该插到外面去！
-It is in the ground.  -Outside!

264
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,310
都是你出的馊主意！
This was your idea!

265
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,710
比尔博
Bilbo.

266
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,630
比尔博，当心那只飞龙！
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

267
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,230
胡扯，这里已经有一千年没出现什么飞龙了
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.

268
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,310
-太棒了  -咱们再来一次吧
-That was good.  -Let's get another one.

269
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,110
梅里亚达克·布兰德巴克和皮瑞格林·图克！
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

270
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,230
我早该料到
I might've known.

271
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,190
致辞，比尔博！
Speech, Bilbo!

272
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,350
致辞！
Speech!

273
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,590
致辞！
Speech!

274
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,110
亲爱的巴金斯家和波芬家
My dear Bagginses and Boffins,

275
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,070
图克家和布兰德巴克家
Tooks and Brandybucks,

276
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,790
葛鲁伯家，丘伯家
Grubbs, Chubbs,

277
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,030
吹号者家
Hornblowers,

278
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,870
博哲家
Bolgers,

279
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,790
布雷斯家
Bracegirdles,

280
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,630
-和傲脚家  -是傲足！
-and Proudfoots.  -Proudfeet!

281
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,950
今天是我111岁生日！
Today is my 111th birthday!

282
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,310
生日快乐！
Happy birthday!

283
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,750
但是和你们这群优秀的霍比特人住在一起
But alas, eleventh-one years is far too short a time to live among

284
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,870
111年也显得太短了
such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

285
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,550
我只认识你们之中一小部分人
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like

286
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,350
而你们值得我更多的热爱
and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.

287
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,700
我要做一件事
I have things to do.

288
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,190
这件事我拖了太久
I've put this off far too long.

289
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,990
很遗憾我要宣布，宴会结束了！
I regret to announce this is the end!

290
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,340
我要走了
I'm going now.

291
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,350
我要向大家道别
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

292
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,940
再见了
Goodbye.

293
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,310
你一定觉得这招很高明
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

294
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,830
你没看到他们的表情吗，甘道夫？
Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their faces?

295
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,100
世上有许多神奇的戒指，但是都不该随便乱用
There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.

296
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,470
我只是开个玩笑
It was just a bit of fun.

297
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,380
不过就像平时一样，你说的对
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

298
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,310
-你会替我照顾好弗罗多吧  -一定会
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?  -Two eyes.

299
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,190
我会尽力照顾他
As often as I can spare them.

300
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,590
-我要把一切都留给他  -那只戒指呢
-I'm leaving everything to him.  -What about this ring of yours?

301
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,110
-那也要留下来吗  -当然了
-Is that staying too?  -Yes, yes.

302
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,630
我用信封装好放在壁炉上面
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

303
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,670
不对，等一下
No. Wait,

304
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,870
它在我的口袋
it's here in my pocket.

305
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,710
真奇怪，不是吗？
Isn't that? Isn't that odd, now?

306
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,910
是啊，有何不可呢？
Yet, after all, why not?

307
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,300
-我何不留着呢？  -你应该把戒指留下来
-Why shouldn I keep it?  -I think you should leave the ring behind.

308
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,910
留下它有这么困难吗？
Is that so hard?

309
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,470
没有呀
Well, no.

310
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,390
当然有
And yes.

311
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,430
现在我突然不想把它给别人了
Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it.

312
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,390
它是我的，是我找到它的 ，它独属于我
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

313
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,790
-你也没必要动肝火吧  -我动肝火也全都是因为你的错！
-There's no need to get angry.  -Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

314
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,070
它是我的
It's mine.

315
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,780
我一个人的
My own.

316
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,110
-我的宝贝  -宝贝？
-My precious.  -Precious?

317
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,190
以前也有别人这么叫过它，那个人不是你
It's been called that before, but not by you.

318
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,000
这是我的戒指，与你无关！
What business is it of yours what I do with my own things!

319
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,950
那只戒指你留着够久了
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

320
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,990
-你是想独吞它！  -比尔博·巴金斯！
-You want it for yourself!  -Bilbo Baggins!

321
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,470
别以为我是只会坑蒙拐骗的江湖术士
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

322
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,350
我不想抢你的东西
I am not trying to rob you.

323
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,030
我只想帮助你
I'm trying to help you.

324
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,830
我们都认识这么久了
All your long years, we've been friends.

325
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,390
像以前一样相信我
Trust me as you once did.

326
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,110
放手吧
Let it go.

327
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,660
你说的对，甘道夫
You're right, Gandalf.

328
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,430
戒指一定要留给弗罗多
The ring must go to Frodo.

329
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,750
天色晚了，路还很长
It's late. The road is long.

330
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,470
是的，是出发的时候
Yes, it is time.

331
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,420
比尔博
Bilbo.

332
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,310
戒指还在你的口袋
The ring is in your pocket.

333
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,990
我替我的书想到一个结尾
I've thought up an ending for my book.

334
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,630
“他从此过着快乐的生活，直到寿终正寝”
"And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."

335
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,270
你一定会的，我的老友
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

336
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,750
再见了，甘道夫
Goodbye, Gandalf.

337
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,150
再见了，亲爱的比尔博
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

338
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,190
虽然路程尚遥远……
The road goes ever on and on.

339
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,110
后会有期
Until our next meeting.

340
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,100
它是我的，我一个人的
It's mine. My own.

341
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,790
我的宝贝
My precious.

342
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,950
黑暗中的谜语
Riddles in the dark.

343
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,590
比尔博！
Bilbo!

344
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,310
比尔博！
Bilbo!

345
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,910
我的宝贝
My precious.

346
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,710
宝贝
Precious.

347
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,480
他走了，对吧？
He's gone, hasn't he?

348
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,310
他一直都说要离开这儿
He talked for so long about leaving.

349
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,230
没想到他真的走了
I didn't think he'd really do it.

350
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,590
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

351
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,550
比尔博的戒指
Bilbo's ring.

352
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,230
他去和精灵住在一起
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

353
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,550
他把贝格恩留给你了
He's left you Bag End.

354
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,670
还有他所有的财产
Along with all his possessions.

355
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,790
戒指现在是你的了
The ring is yours now.

356
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,830
-把它藏起来  -你要去哪儿？
-Put it somewhere out of sight.  -Where are you going?

357
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,310
-我必须去办一些事  -什么事？
-There are some things that I must see to.  -What things?

358
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,790
-我有一些疑问一定要得到解答  -可你你才刚到
-Questions. Questions that need answering.  -You've only just arrived.

359
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,310
我不明白
I don't understand.

360
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,660
我也不明白
Neither do I.

361
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,190
保守秘密
Keep it secret.

362
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,190
把它藏起来
Keep it safe.

363
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,350
夏尔！
Shire!

364
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,790
巴金斯！
Baggins!

365
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,270
第二纪元，3434年
The year 3434 of the Second Age.

366
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,830
以下是关于刚铎之王埃西铎
Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor

367
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,710
以及找到至尊魔戒的记载
and the finding of the Ring of Power.

368
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,070
我终于拿到它了
It has come to me.

369
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,710
这只至尊魔戒，将是王国的镇国之宝
The One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

370
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,350
我的后代将永远对它效忠
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate

371
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,340
它决不能受到任何的伤害
for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.

372
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,070
这是我的宝贝
It is precious to me,

373
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,590
我经历了多少的痛苦才得到它
though I buy it with great pain.

374
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,910
指环上的刻痕逐渐褪色
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

375
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,950
初入炽焰一般闪耀的文字，现在也全部消失
The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared.

376
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,230
只有置身火焰之中才能让文字重现
A secret now that only fire can tell.

377
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,710
夏尔
Shire.

378
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,910
巴金斯
Baggins.

379
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,430
巴金斯家族不住这里，他们在霍比屯
There's no Bagginses around here. They're all up in Hobbiton.

380
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,670
那边
That way.

381
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,510
暂借烈酒驱忧愁
Hey, ah, bottle I came.

382
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,830
平我心绪缓我忧
To heal my heart and drown my woe.

383
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,340
尽管雨打风又刮
Rain may fall and wind may blow.

384
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,470
我却紧走不将休
But there still be.

385
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,110
尚有万千路须行
Many miles to go.

386
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,230
落雨之声多美妙
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain.

387
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,590
潺潺溪流也温柔
And the stream that falls From hill to plain.

388
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,630
不管雨水与清泉
Better than rain or rippling brook.

389
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,220
都不比这儿的啤酒
Is a mug of beer inside this Took.

390
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,470
最近边境有些怪人出没
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

391
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,790
包括矮人和其他更邪恶的生物
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

392
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,670
恐怕是要开战了
War is brewing.

393
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,190
漫山遍野都是哥布林
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

394
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,990
全都是些谣传还有骗小孩的故事，仅此而已了
Far-off tales and children stories, that's all that is.

395
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,670
你越来越像老比尔博·巴金斯了，疯疯癫癫的
You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

396
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,830
弗罗多先生在这儿呢，不过他的确有些疯
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

397
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,430
我为他感到自豪
I'm proud of it.

398
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,870
-干杯，老爹  -干杯
-Cheers, Gaffer.  -Cheers.

399
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,190
外部世界与我们无关
It's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders.

400
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,670
只要我们不去找麻烦，麻烦就不会找上门
Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you.

401
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,230
-大家晚安  -晚安
-Good night, lads.  -Good night.

402
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,910
晚安，美丽的姑娘
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

403
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,420
小心谁在跟你甜言蜜语
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

404
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,190
别担心，山姆，罗丝知道他是个混球
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

405
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,420
真的吗？
Does she?

406
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,070
-晚安  山姆  -晚安，弗罗多先生
-Good night, Sam.  -Good night, Mister Frodo.

407
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,300
你有守密吗？它安全吗？
Is it secret? Is it safe?

408
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,310
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

409
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,480
把手伸出来，弗罗多
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

410
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,820
很凉的
It's quite cool.

411
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,150
你能看到什么？
What can you see?

412
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,300
你能看到什么吗？
Can you see anything?

413
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,390
什么也没有
Nothing.

414
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,070
什么也没看见
There's nothing.

415
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,670
等等
Wait.

416
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,990
上面有刻痕
There are markings.

417
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,870
好像是某种精灵文，我看不懂
It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.

418
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,670
很少有人能看得懂
There are few who can.

419
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,030
这是魔多的古文字，但我现在不能念出来
The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.

420
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,710
魔多？！
Mordor?!

421
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,030
其上的刻痕用通用语来说是
In the common tongue, it says,

422
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,710
至尊戒，驭众戒
One Ring to rule them all,

423
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,260
至尊戒，寻众戒
One Ring to find them,

424
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,670
魔戒至尊引众戒
One Ring to bring them all,

425
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,990
禁锢众戒黑暗中
and in the darkness bind them.

426
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,670
这就是至尊魔戒
This is the One Ring

427
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,110
是黑暗魔君索伦以末日火山的烈焰铸成的众戒之王
forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.

428
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,350
埃西铎从索伦手中夺了过来
Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself.

429
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,710
比尔博找到它
Bilbo found it.

430
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,070
-在咕鲁的洞穴中  -是的
-In Gollum's cave.  -Yes.

431
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,830
六十年来，比尔博不动声色地持有至尊魔戒
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping

432
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,430
他因而延长了寿命，延迟了老化
prolonging his life, delaying old age.

433
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,470
但是一切已时过境迁，弗罗多，黑暗势力已在魔多重聚
But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor.

434
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,110
至尊魔戒已经醒来
The Ring has awoken.

435
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,070
它听到了主人的召唤
It's heard its master's call.

436
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,150
但是他已经被消灭了，索伦已经被消灭了
But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed.

437
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,950
不，弗罗多
No, Frodo.

438
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,190
索伦的灵魂是不死的
The spirit of Sauron endured.

439
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,750
他的命运和至尊魔戒紧紧相连，而至尊魔戒幸存
His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived.

440
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,190
黑暗魔君重塑了肉身
Sauron has returned.

441
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,230
他的半兽人大军与日俱增
His Orcs have multiplied.

442
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,430
黑暗要塞巴拉多也被重建
His fortress at Barad-dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

443
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,430
索伦只需要这枚戒指，就能让黑暗再度笼罩大地
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.

444
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,670
他在搜寻它
He is seeking it.

445
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,790
全心全意，不择手段地搜寻
Seeking it. All his thought is bent on it.

446
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,670
同时至尊魔戒也渴望
For the Ring yearns above all else

447
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,310
重回主人的手中
to return to the hand of its master.

448
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,270
他们本为一体
They are one,

449
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,590
至尊魔戒和黑暗魔君
the Ring and the Dark Lord.

450
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,830
弗罗多
Frodo

451
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,230
绝对不能让他找到至尊魔戒
he must never find it.

452
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,510
好
All right.

453
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,110
我们把它藏起来，从此再也不提
We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again.

454
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,990
没人知道它在这儿，对不对？
No one knows it's here, do they?

455
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,870
对不对，甘道夫？
Do they, Gandalf?

456
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,350
有一个人知道比尔博得到至尊魔戒
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.

457
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,590
我四处寻找咕鲁
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

458
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,950
但是魔君先我一步
But the enemy found him first.

459
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,140
他不晓得被严刑拷打了多久
I don't know how long they tortured him.

460
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,830
但在歇斯底里的哀嚎和呻吟声中，他们听出两个名字
But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.

461
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,150
夏尔！
Shire!

462
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,990
巴金斯！
Baggins!

463
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,990
夏尔？
Shire.

464
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,070
巴金斯？他们会找到这儿来！
Baggins. But that would Iead them here!

465
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,950
什么人？
Who goes there?

466
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,910
你拿去，甘道夫！
Take it, Gandalf!

467
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,340
-快拿走！  -不行，弗罗多
-Take it!  -No, Frodo.

468
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,910
-你一定要拿去！  -你不能把魔戒给我！
-You must take it!  -You cannot offer me this ring!

469
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,470
-我要把它给你！  -千万别引诱我，弗罗多！
-I'm giving it to you!  -Don't tempt me, Frodo!

470
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,230
我不敢拿
I dare not take it.

471
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,020
更无法保护它
Not even to keep it safe.

472
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,150
你要了解，弗罗多
Understand, Frodo,

473
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,430
我只希望利用至尊魔戒行善事
I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.

474
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,590
但是透过我，魔戒将释放无法想像的邪恶力量
But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.

475
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,070
-但是魔戒不能留在夏尔  -没错
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!  -No.

476
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,590
是的，的确不能
No, it can't.

477
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,310
我该怎么做
What must I do?

478
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,500
-你需要马上离开，越快越好  -去哪里，我要去哪里？
-You must leave. And leave quickly.  -Where? Where do I go?

479
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,990
离开夏尔，赶到布理村
Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree.

480
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,340
布理
Bree.

481
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,310
-那你呢？  -我会在
-What about you?  -I'll be waiting for you

482
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,980
跃马旅店等你
at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

483
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,900
-魔戒在那儿安全吗？  -我不知道，弗罗多
-And the Ring will be safe there?  -I don't know, Frodo.

484
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,110
我无法回答你
I don't have any answers.

485
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,150
我必须去见巫师长，他既有智慧又力量强大。相信我，弗罗多
I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

486
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,510
他知道该怎么做
He'll know what to do.

487
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,950
你不能用巴金斯的姓氏了
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.

488
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,670
这名字在夏尔之外不安全
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

489
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,630
只能在白天赶路，记得别走大道
Travel only by day. And stay off the road.

490
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,470
我可以穿过农田
I can cut across country easily enough.

491
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,310
弗罗多，好孩子
My dear Frodo.

492
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,590
霍比特人真的不可思议
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

493
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,750
只要一个月，你就能自以为了解他们
You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.

494
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,260
然而过了一百年后
And yet, after a hundred years,

495
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,510
他们却仍然能让你吃惊
they can still surprise you.

496
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,470
趴下来
Get down.

497
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,190
可恶的山姆卫斯·甘吉，你一直在偷听吗？
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping?

498
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,830
我才没有偷听什么，我只是在窗外除草而已
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was cutting the grass under the window.

499
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,460
现在除草未免太晚了，不是吗？
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

500
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,510
-我听到有人大声说话  -你听到什么？快说！
-I heard raised voices.  -What did you hear? Speak!

501
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,830
没什么
Nothing important.

502
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,470
我听到关于什么戒指，黑暗魔君和世界末日
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world, but.

503
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,430
甘道夫先生，别伤害我，别把我变成死的东西
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

504
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,790
不要吗？
No?

505
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,110
也许不会
Perhaps not.

506
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,790
你有更好的用处
I've thought of a better use for you.

507
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,550
快点，山姆卫斯，跟上来
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

508
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,270
你们千万要小心
Be careful, both of you.

509
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,310
敌人有很多眼线
The enemy has many spies in his service.

510
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,470
飞鸟，野兽
Birds, beasts.

511
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,070
戒指安全码？
Is it safe?

512
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,110
千万别戴上
Never put it on

513
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,670
黑暗魔君的爪牙会被邪恶的力量吸引来
for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.

514
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,390
弗罗多，你要记住
Always remember, Frodo,

515
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,070
至尊魔戒想要回到主人手上
the Ring is trying to get back to its master.

516
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,550
它想要被找到
It wants to be found.

517
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,350
这就是了
This is it.

518
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,830
这是什么
This is what?

519
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,230
我只要再跨一步
If I take one more step,

520
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,630
就是我离家最远的一次
it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.

521
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,350
走吧，山姆
Come on, Sam.

522
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,630
我记得比尔博老是说
Remember what Bilbo used to say,

523
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,950
-旅行很危险，弗罗多  -一旦你出了门
-it's a dangerous business, Frodo.  -Going out your door,

524
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,550
走在了道上，一旦你不专心看路
you step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet,

525
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,950
谁晓得你会被带到哪里去
there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

526
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,790
山姆
Sam.

527
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,390
木精灵
Wood-elves.

528
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,630
他们要去白塔外的港湾
They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.

529
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,950
去往灰港岸
To the Grey Havens.

530
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,510
他们要离开中土世界
They're leaving Middle-earth.

531
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,950
永远不再回来
Never to return.

532
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,950
不知道为什么
I don't know why,

533
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,030
我觉得很悲伤
it makes me sad.

534
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,750
不管躺在那儿都是盘根错节的，顶着我的后背
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.

535
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,150
闭上眼睛
Just shut your eyes,

536
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,150
想像你回到自己的床上
and imagine you're back in your own bed

537
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,270
上面有柔软的床垫和舒适的羽毛枕头
with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

538
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,230
没用的，弗罗多先生
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

539
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,310
在荒郊野外的根本睡不着
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

540
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,030
我也睡不着，山姆
Me neither, Sam.

541
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,550
末日火山再度升起烟硝
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

542
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,390
时间不多了
The hour grows late.

543
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,190
所以灰袍巫师甘道夫匆忙赶到艾辛格
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard

544
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,830
寻求我的建议
seeking my counsel.

545
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,990
你就是为了这件事而来吗？
For that is why you have come, is it not?

546
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,510
我的老友
My old friend.

547
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,350
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

548
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,150
-你确定吗？  -千真万确
-You are sure of this?  -Beyond any doubt.

549
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,270
至尊魔戒被发现了
So the Ring of Power has been found.

550
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,670
这么多年来，一直悄悄藏身于夏尔
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

551
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,110
-就在我眼前  -你却没有发现
-Under my very nose.  -Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

552
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,110
半身人的烟草熏坏了你的脑子
Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.

553
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,990
但是还来得及，还有时间对抗索伦的势力
But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

554
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,670
时间？
Time?

555
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,270
我们还哪来的时间？
What time do you think we have?

556
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,550
索伦的力量几乎完全恢复
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

557
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,950
虽然他的肉身尚未重塑
He cannot yet take physical form,

558
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,870
但他灵魂的力量强大无比
but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

559
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,630
虽然被困在要塞中，可是他却无所不知
Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.

560
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,150
他的视线能穿透乌云，阴影，土地，甚至肉体
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

561
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,750
你知道我在说什么吗，甘道夫？
You know of what I speak, Gandalf?

562
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,950
一个被烈焰包围的可怖的魔眼
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

563
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,670
那就是索伦之眼
The Eye of Sauron.

564
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,480
他正在召集所有邪恶的力量
He is gathering all evil to him.

565
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,650
很快的，他就能集结一支强大的军队
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army

566
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,580
而中土世界也将会覆亡
great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

567
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,270
你居然知道这些？
You know this?

568
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,310
怎么可能？
How?

569
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,590
我亲眼看到的
I have seen it.

570
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,190
真知晶球是个危险的工具，萨鲁曼
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

571
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,430
为什么？
Why?

572
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,590
为什么要害怕使用它？
Why should we fear to use it?

573
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,190
其他的真知之石下落不明
They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing-stones.

574
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,590
我们不知道还有谁也在看
We do not know who else may be watching.

575
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,910
一切都太晚了
The hour is later than you think.

576
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,420
索伦的行动已经展开
Sauron's forces are already moving.

577
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,430
那九个已经离开米那斯魔窟
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

578
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,870
那九个？
The Nine?

579
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,070
他们在仲夏夜跨越艾辛河
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve

580
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,950
伪装成黑骑士
disguised as riders in black.

581
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,110
-他们已经到了夏尔？  -他们会找到至尊魔戒
-They've reached the Shire?  -They will find the Ring.

582
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,950
然后杀死它的持有者
And kill the one who carries it.

583
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,950
弗罗多！
Frodo!

584
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,990
你不会真幼稚到以为霍比特人能对抗索伦吧？
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?

585
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,510
谁也对抗不了他
There are none who can.

586
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,750
所有对抗魔多的人
Against the power of Mordor,

587
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,590
都是死路一条
there can be no victory.

588
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,750
我们必须加入他们，甘道夫
We must join with him, Gandalf.

589
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,300
我们必须投靠索伦
We must join with Sauron.

590
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,670
这么做才聪明，朋友
It would be wise, my friend.

591
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,590
告诉我
Tell me,

592
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,830
朋友
friend,

593
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,390
智者萨鲁曼几时发疯了？
when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

594
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,590
我给你机会
I gave you the chance of

595
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,350
自愿帮助我
aiding me willingly,

596
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,710
但是你却宁愿选择受苦
but you have elected the way of pain!

597
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,550
弗罗多先生？
Mr. Frodo?

598
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,910
弗罗多？弗罗多！
Frodo? Frodo!

599
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,550
-我还以为我把你给跟丢了  -你在说什么
-I thought I'd lost you.  -What are you taking about?

600
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,750
-甘道夫跟我说过  -他说什么？
-It's just something Gandalf said.  -What did he say?

601
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,470
“紧跟着他，山姆卫斯·甘吉”，而我也一定会紧紧跟着你
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee." And I don't mean to.

602
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,340
山姆，我们还在夏尔，会有什么事？
Sam, we're still in the Shire. What could possibly happen?

603
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,340
弗罗多
Frodo.

604
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,870
-梅里，是弗罗多·巴金斯  -你好，弗罗多
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.  -Hello, Frodo.

605
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,430
你给我起来
Get off him.

606
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,390
起来，弗罗多
Come on, Frodo.

607
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,510
这算什么？
What's the meaning of this?

608
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,030
你们又偷摘老农夫马嘎的菜！
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

609
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,390
快给我滚出去！
You get back here!

610
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,620
快从我的地里滚出去！
Get out of my field!

611
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,670
要是被我抓到就够你们受的！
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

612
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,790
生什么气嘛，不过是两根红萝卜
I don't know why he's so upset. It's only a couple of carrots.

613
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,110
还有几棵卷心菜
And some cabbages.

614
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,230
和上礼拜偷的几袋马铃薯
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.

615
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,470
-还有上上个礼拜的蘑菇  -好了，皮平，我是说
-And then the mushrooms the week before.  -Yes! Pippin. My point is

616
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,910
他太小题大作了！
he's clearly overreacting!

617
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,550
快跑！
Run!

618
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,600
噢，太险了
Oh, that was close.

619
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,790
我好像摔断了什么
I think I've broken something.

620
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,100
就数烈酒鹿和图克家的人最会惹麻烦！
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

621
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,950
什么？这可是条捷径耶
What? That was just a detour. A short cut.

622
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,430
-这算去哪儿的捷径？  -蘑菇！
-Short cut to what?  -Mushrooms!

623
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,670
那是我的
That's mine.

624
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,070
好棒的蘑菇，梅里
That's nice, Merry.

625
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,590
这儿也有，山姆
Here's a nice one, Sam.

626
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,350
我觉得我们最好躲起来
I think we should get off the road.

627
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,950
快躲起来！
Get off the road!

628
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,630
快点！
Quick!

629
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,790
别出声！
Be quiet!

630
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,270
那是什么东西？
What was that?

631
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,470
你看到什么吗？
Anything?

632
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,670
什么也没有
Nothing.

633
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,660
这是怎么回事？
What is going on?

634
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,980
黑骑士在找什么东西，或是什么人
That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone.

635
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,830
弗罗多？
Frodo?

636
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,580
趴下来！
Get down!

637
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,670
我得离开夏尔
I have to leave the Shire.

638
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,980
我跟山姆要赶到布理
Sam and I must get to Bree.

639
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,670
没问题
Right.

640
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,270
走巴寇伯理渡口，跟我来
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

641
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,910
快跑！
Run!

642
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,110
这儿，跟上来！
This way! Follow me!

643
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,750
快跑！
Run!

644
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,830
山姆，快去松开绳子
Get the rope, Sam!

645
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,990
弗罗多
Frodo!

646
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,150
快跑，弗罗多！
Run, Frodo!

647
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,500
-快跑！  -快！
-Go!  -Hurry!

648
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,350
弗罗多，快跑啊！
Frodo, come on!

649
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,310
-快点，快！  -跳呀！
-Come on! Faster!  -Jump!

650
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,470
-最近的渡桥有多远？  -烈酒桥，二十里路
-How far to the nearest crossing?  -The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

651
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,590
来吧
Come on.

652
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,190
-你们要做什么？  -我们要去跃马旅店
-What do you want?  -We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

653
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,510
霍比特人，四个霍比特人！
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

654
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,710
听口音是从夏尔来，你们上这儿有何贵干？
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree?

655
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,270
我们想投宿在旅店里，来干什么是我们自己的事
We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own.

656
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,950
好吧，我也不是故意找碴
All right, young sir. I meant no offense.

657
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,620
天黑后我就得多问一下
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

658
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,750
听说附近有怪人游荡
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

659
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,070
小心一点比较好
Can't be too careful.

660
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,270
小心点，注意脚下！
Out of the way! Watch where you're waking.

661
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,790
跃马旅店

662
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,910
对不起
Excuse me.

663
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,710
晚上好，客人们，有什么需要吗
Good evening, little masters. What can I do for you?

664
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,990
如果你们想歇一晚,我们有霍比特人住的舒适房间
If you're seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

665
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,870
很乐意为你们服务，请问怎么称呼？
Always proud to cater to the little Folk, Mister?

666
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,030
山下，我叫山下
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

667
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,780
-山下  -我们是灰袍巫师甘道夫的朋友
-Underhill, yes.  -We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

668
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,150
-你能告诉他我们来了吗  -甘道夫？
-Can you tell him we've arrived?  -Gandalf?

669
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,310
甘道夫？
Gandal?

670
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,830
噢，对了
Oh, yes.

671
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,110
我想起来了，一个老头子
I remember. Elderly chap.

672
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,390
长长的灰胡子，尖尖的帽子
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

673
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,630
半年没见到他了
Not seen him for six months.

674
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,710
现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

675
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,140
山姆
Sam,

676
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,230
他一定会来的
he'll be here. He'll come.

677
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,070
让开！
Get out of my way!

678
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,110
那是什么？
What's that?

679
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,870
伙计，这就是一品脱的啤酒
This, my friend, is a pint.

680
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,630
有这么大杯的？
It comes in pints?

681
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,740
-我也要来一杯  -可你已经喝了很多了！
-I'm getting one.  -You got a whole half already!

682
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,910
我们来了之后，那个人一直盯着你
That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.

683
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,950
打扰一下
Excuse me.

684
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,750
在角落的那位，他是谁？
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

685
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,310
他是一个游侠，他们是成天在荒郊野外游荡的危险人物
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

686
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,110
我不知道他的名字，但这儿的人都叫他神行客
What his right name is, I've never heard, but around here he's known as Strider.

687
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,670
神行客
Strider.

688
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,950
巴金斯
Baggins.

689
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,950
巴金斯
Baggins.

690
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,190
巴金斯？我认识呀
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

691
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,190
他在那儿，弗罗多·巴金斯
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

692
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,430
我是他表哥
He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side

693
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,940
也算是远房亲戚啦
and my third cousin, twice removed.

694
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,190
-皮平！  -小心点，弗罗多！
-Pippin!  -Steady on, Frodo!

695
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,180
你躲不了的
You cannot hide.

696
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,270
我看得见你
I see you.

697
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,670
在空隙中
There is no life

698
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,030
没有生命
in the void.

699
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,750
只有
Only

700
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,150
死亡
death.

701
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:47,020
你太惹人注意了  “山下”先生
You draw far too much attention to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

702
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,700
你想怎么样？
What do you want?

703
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,030
要你小心点，你戴的可不是小玩意儿
A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry.

704
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,390
-我什么都没戴  -是啊
-I carry nothing.  -Indeed.

705
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,190
只要我想，我就能随意遁身
I can avoid being seen if I wish,

706
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,100
但完全隐形却不是件易事
but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

707
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,230
-你是什么人？  -你害怕吗？
-Who are you?  -Are you frightened?

708
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,430
害怕
Yes.

709
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,590
光惧怕还远远不够  我知道谁在找你
Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.

710
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,110
放开他！否则我让你好看，长腿的家伙！
Let him go! Or I'll have you, Longshanks!

711
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,870
小霍比特人，你很有勇气，但这救不了你
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit. But that will not save you.

712
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,030
你不能再等巫师了，弗罗多
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

713
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,220
他们来了
They're coming.

714
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,390
他们究竟是什么人？
What are they?

715
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,670
他们曾经是人类
They were once Men.

716
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,150
人类伟大的国王
Great kings of Men.

717
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,750
但是索伦用九只魔戒引诱他们
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.

718
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,470
而他们利欲熏心，毫不迟疑地收下
Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.

719
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,990
结果一一沉沦于黑暗之中
One by one, falling into darkness.

720
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,710
成为黑暗魔君的傀儡
Now they are slaves to his will.

721
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,790
他们是纳兹古尔
They are the Nazgul.

722
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,710
也就是戒灵，他们介于生与死之间
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

723
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,870
他们随时感受到
At all times they feel

724
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,990
魔戒的存在
the presence of the Ring,

725
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,750
被至尊魔戒吸引着，他们会一直追杀你
drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.

726
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,670
-你要带我们去哪儿？  -荒野
-Where are you taking us?  -Into the wild.

727
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,910
你怎么知道神行客是甘道夫的朋友？
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?

728
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,950
我觉得敌人的仆役会看起来面带微笑
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer

729
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,230
-但骨子里却很凶恶  -他够让人厌恶了
-and feel fouler.  -He's foul enough.

730
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,710
没办法，我们只能相信他
We have no choice, but to trust him.

731
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,310
-他要带我们去哪里？  -瑞文戴尔，甘吉先生
-But where is he leading us?  -To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

732
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,950
-精灵王爱隆的家  -你们听到吗？瑞文戴尔！
-To the house of Elrond.  -Did you hear that? Rivendell.

733
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,310
我们要去见精灵了
We're going to see the Elves.

734
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,150
-各位，天黑才能歇脚  -那早餐怎么办呢？
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.  -What about breakfast?

735
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,030
-你们已经吃过了  -我们才吃过一顿
-You've already had it.  -We've had one, yes.

736
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,470
那第二顿早餐呢？
What about second breakfast?

737
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:59,030
皮平，他不知道有第二顿早餐
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

738
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,470
那早午餐呢？午餐，下午茶，晚餐，宵夜呢？
What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

739
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,830
-他应该都知道吧  -我看不见得
-He knows about them, doesn't he?  -I wouldn count on it.

740
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,950
皮平！
Pippin!

741
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,910
没有霍比特人的时候，他们吃什么呢？
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

742
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,950
她是谁？
Who is she?

743
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,270
歌谣中唱到的女人
This woman you sing of.

744
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,060
是露西安
It's the lady of Luthien.

745
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:31,430
嫁给凡人贝伦的精灵
The EIf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.

746
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,390
她怎么了？
What happened to her?

747
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,110
她死了
She died.

748
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,460
休息会儿吧，弗罗多
Get some sleep, Frodo.

749
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,870
艾辛格遵从您的命令
The power of Isengard is at your command,

750
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,470
索伦，中土世界的统领
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

751
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:14,590
替我召集一支听命于魔多的大军
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

752
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,670
主人，魔多有什么命令，魔眼有什么吩咐？
What orders from Mordor, my lord? What does the Eye command?

753
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,030
我们有很多事要做
We have work to do.

754
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:14,270
这些树非常坚韧，主人，树根很深
The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep.

755
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,510
把它们全都拉倒
Rip them all down.

756
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,830
这是风云顶瞭望台
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sul.

757
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,150
今晚我们在这里过夜
We shall rest here tonight.

758
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,310
这些给你们，一定要随身佩带
These are for you. Keep them close.

759
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,980
我四处看一下
I'm going to have a look around.

760
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,270
别乱跑
Stay here.

761
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,030
我的蕃茄熟了
My tomato's burst.

762
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,110
给我一些培根好吗
Could I have some bacon?

763
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,270
山姆，吃点蕃茄吧
Want a tomato, Sam?

764
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,310
-你们在做什么？！  -煎蕃茄，香肠和培根
-What are you doing?!  -Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

765
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,190
-我替你留了一些，弗罗多先生  -笨蛋，快把火熄掉
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.  -Put it out, you fools!

766
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:33,390
-快熄掉！  -这下可好了，弄的蕃茄上都是灰
-Put it out!  -That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

767
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,590
快走！
Go!

768
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,510
退后，恶魔！
Back, you devils!

769
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,230
弗罗多！
Frodo!

770
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,190
山姆
Oh, Sam.

771
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,220
神行客！
Strider!

772
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,470
-快救救他，神行客  -他被戒灵的剑刺中
-Help him, Strider.  -He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

773
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,870
我救不了他，精灵才有办法
This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs Elvish medicine.

774
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,510
快点！
Hurry!

775
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,670
离瑞文戴尔还有六天行程，他撑不下去的
We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!

776
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,750
你要撑下去，弗罗多
Hold on, Frodo.

777
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,060
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

778
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,430
你看，弗罗多，是被比尔博变成石头的食人妖
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

779
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,470
弗罗多先生？他摸起来好冷
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

780
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,070
他会死吗？
Is he going to die?

781
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:12,180
他正在进入冥界，很快也会成为死灵
He's passing into the Shadow World. He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

782
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,140
-他们就在附近  -山姆，你知道阿夕拉斯草吗？
-They're close.  -Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

783
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,830
-阿夕拉斯？  -又叫王之剑
-Athelas?  -Kingsfoil.

784
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,070
王之剑，那是一种草药
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

785
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,470
那能阻缓毒性发作，快去采
It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry!

786
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,990
怎么了，游侠竟然毫无防备？
What's this? A Ranger caught off his guard?

787
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,910
弗罗多
Frodo.

788
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,990
我是亚玟，我来帮助你
Im Arwen. Telin le thaed.

789
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,630
回到光明中来
Came to light.

790
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,590
她是谁？
Who is she?

791
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,990
弗罗多
Frodo.

792
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,790
-她是个精灵  -他快失去意识了
-She's an Elf.  -He's fading.

793
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,270
他撑不了多久的
He's not going to last.

794
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,150
一定要带他去找我父亲
We must get him to my father.

795
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,750
-我找了你两天  -你们要带他去哪儿
-I've been looking for you for two days.  -Where are you taking him?

796
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:54,060
五名戒灵跟着你，我不知道另外四个在哪里
There are five Wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know.

797
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,590
陪着霍比特人，我会来接你们
Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon.

798
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,470
我骑得比较快，我来载他
Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.

799
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,600
路上太危险了
Andelu i ven.

800
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,020
他们在说什么？
What are they saying?

801
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,390
弗罗多快死了，如果我能渡河
Frodo is dying. If I can get across the river,

802
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,160
我族人的力量就可以保护他
the power of my people will protect him.

803
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,750
我不怕他们
I do not fear them.

804
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,070
亚玟
Arwen,

805
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,430
拼命骑，别回头
ride hard. Don't look back.

806
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,830
你在干什么？戒灵正在追杀他！
What are you doing?! Those Wraiths are still out there!

807
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,190
把半身人交给我，女精灵
Give up the halfling, She-EIf.

808
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,710
如果你想要，那就来抢啊
If you want him, come and claim him.

809
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,060
不，不要！
No. No!

810
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,630
弗罗多，你不能死
Frodo, no.

811
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,140
弗罗多，别放弃！
Frodo, don't give in!

812
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,350
现在不行
Not now.

813
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,790
请赐给我力量
What grace is given me,

814
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,270
让他度过灾厄
let it pass to him.

815
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,670
让他免于死亡
Let him be spared.

816
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,310
拯救他的生命
Save him.

817
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,920
-我在哪里？  -你在爱隆王的王宫
-Where am I?  -You are in the house of Elrond.

818
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:27,830
如果你想知道，现在是十月二十四日，早上十点
And it is 10：00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.

819
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,550
-甘道夫！  -是的，我在这儿
-Gandalf!  -Yes, I'm here.

820
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,310
你没有死算你幸运
And you're lucky to be here too.

821
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,990
再过几小时你就没救了
A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.

822
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,310
但是你的生命力真强，亲爱的霍比特人
But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.

823
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,470
发生什么事，甘道夫？
What happened, Gandalf?

824
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:03,830
-你怎么没去找我们？  -对不起，弗罗多
-Why didn't you meet us?  -I am sorry, Frodo.

825
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,270
我有事耽搁了
I was delayed.

826
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:15,350
你不能随便和萨鲁曼绝交
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.

827
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:24,190
别再抗拒了，没有用的
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

828
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,230
你不屈从于魔戒的力量
Embrace the power of the Ring

829
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,340
就等着灭亡吧
or embrace your own destruction!

830
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:36,550
世上只有一个魔戒之王
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

831
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:40,750
只有他能够驾驭魔戒
Only one who can bend it to his will.

832
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,550
而他绝不会和你分享权力
And he does not share power.

833
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,230
所以你选择了死亡
So you have chosen death.

834
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:17,100
甘道夫，怎么了？
Gandalf? What is it?

835
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,910
没事，弗罗多
Nothing, Frodo.

836
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,580
弗罗多！
Frodo!

837
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,220
-山姆  -你终于醒了
-Sam!  -Bless you, you're awake!

838
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,190
山姆一直守在你身边
Sam has hardly left your side.

839
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,550
我们很担心你，对吧，甘道夫
We were that worried about you. Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

840
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,070
幸好有爱隆王，你开始痊愈了
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.

841
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,150
欢迎来到瑞文戴尔，弗罗多·巴金斯
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

842
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,470
-比尔博！  -弗罗多，好孩子
-Bilbo!  -Hello, Frodo, my lad.

843
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,390
比尔博
Bilbo.

844
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,150
《霍比特人》  比尔博·巴金斯著
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

845
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:51,790
-太棒了  -我真想再回去
-This is wonderful.  -I meant to go back,

846
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,910
在幽暗密林的小径上徜徉
wonder at the powers of Mirkwood,

847
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,660
探访长湖镇
visit Lake-town,

848
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,310
再看一眼孤山
see the Lonely Mountain again.

849
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,630
但是我终于年老力衰了
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

850
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,260
夏尔
Shire.

851
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,550
我好想家
I miss the Shire.

852
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:27,110
我从小就幻想能到别的地方
I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else.

853
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,020
跟你一起出游，一起去冒险
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

854
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,540
但是我自己的冒险却完全不同
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.

855
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,990
我跟你不一样，比尔博
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

856
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,390
乖孩子
My dear boy.

857
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,470
-我还有什么没收拾好？  -这么快就开始打包了？
-Now, what have I forgotten?  -Packed already?

858
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,070
越早准备越好
No harm in being prepared.

859
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,840
-我还以为你想见见精灵  -是啊
-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.  -I do.

860
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,910
-你想看得不得了  -的确如此
-More than anything.  -I did.

861
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,070
只是
It's just.

862
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,430
我们完成了甘道夫给予的任务，不是吗
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

863
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,310
我们把魔戒带到瑞文戴尔，我觉得
We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought

864
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,790
你的伤快好了，我们也要走了
seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.

865
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,710
我们要回家了
Off home.

866
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,910
你说的对，山姆
You are right, Sam.

867
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,830
我们完成了任务
We did what we set out to do.

868
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,960
魔戒在这儿很安全
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

869
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,390
我可以回家了
I am ready to go home.

870
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,190
他的力气恢复了
His strength returns.

871
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:50,110
但他的伤永远无法痊愈，一辈子都会跟着他
That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.

872
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,230
一路上的艰难坎坷已经证明了
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring,

873
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,140
霍比特人能够抗拒黑暗势力的诱惑
the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.

874
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,710
他不该扛下这份重担
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

875
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:06,350
-弗罗多已经尽力了  -敌人正在蠢蠢欲动，甘道夫
-We can ask no more of Frodo.  -Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

876
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,230
索伦的大军在东方集结，他的邪眼正盯着瑞文戴尔
Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

877
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,190
你还跟我说萨鲁曼也背叛了我们
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

878
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,670
我们已经孤军奋战了
Our list of allies grows thin.

879
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,150
他的恶行远不止此
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

880
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,980
他用邪恶的巫术将哥布林与半兽人混合起来
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

881
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,660
在艾辛格的洞窟之中，一支邪恶的大军正在酝酿
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

882
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,550
一支能在白天行军千里的劲旅
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.

883
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,140
萨鲁曼要来抢夺至尊魔戒
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

884
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,670
精灵无法抵抗这股邪恶力量
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.

885
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,230
更无法对抗双面夹击
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

886
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,180
甘道夫
Gandalf,

887
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,040
至尊魔戒不能留在这儿
the Ring cannot stay here.

888
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,790
整个中土世界已经危在旦夕
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

889
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,710
他们必须决定未来何去何从
They must decide now how to end it.

890
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,340
精灵的时代已经过去，我们的族民迁徙至别处
The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores.

891
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,580
我们走了，你们要向谁求救。矮人吗？
Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves?

892
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:32,920
他们都躲在山洞挖宝藏，丝毫不关心别人
They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubles of others.

893
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,350
人类承载着我们的希望
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

894
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,390
人类？
Men?

895
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,470
人类太脆弱，他们没有希望了
Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.

896
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:48,110
努曼诺尔人的血液不再纯正，他们的骄傲与荣誉消失殆尽
The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.

897
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:51,950
魔戒遗留至今完全是人类的过错
It is because of Men the Ring survives.

898
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,790
当时我就在场，甘道夫
I was there, Gandalf.

899
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,310
三千年前
I was there 3000 years ago,

900
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,500
埃西铎夺走了至尊魔戒
when Isildur took the Ring.

901
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,590
人类屈服于诱惑的那天，我也在场
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.

902
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,790
埃西铎，快，跟我来
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

903
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,940
我带埃西铎来到末日火山
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom,

904
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,700
只有在那里，魔戒才能被彻底摧毁
where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.

905
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,510
快把它扔下去！
Cast it into the fire!

906
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,470
-快毁了它！  -不
-Destroy it!  -No.

907
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,950
埃西铎！
Isildur!

908
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:45,150
那天就该终结的邪恶，却残留至今
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.

909
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:53,510
埃西铎被魔戒害死，皇室血脉也就此断绝
Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken.

910
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:58,060
人类世界早已失去力量
There's no strength left in the world of Men.

911
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:03,110
-他们群龙无首，四处流浪  -还有一个人能让他们团结
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.  -There is one who could unite them.

912
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,670
还有一个人能继承刚铎王位
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

913
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,150
但他早就放弃王位了
He turned from that path a Long time ago.

914
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,510
他选择自我放逐
He has chosen exile.

915
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,510
你不是精灵
You are no EIf.

916
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,870
我是南方来的游侠
Men of the South are welcome here.

917
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,990
-你是谁？  -我是灰袍巫师甘道夫的朋友
-Who are you?  -I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

918
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,230
那我们是为了共同的目的来到此地
Then we are here on common purpose,

919
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,070
朋友
friend.

920
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:18,230
纳希尔圣剑的碎片
The shards of Narsil.

921
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:26,190
就是这把利刃斩断了索伦的手掌
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.

922
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,310
它锋利依旧
It's still sharp.

923
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,310
但现在却只是残破的宝物
But no more than a broken heirloom.

924
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:13,150
你为什么惧怕过去？
Why do you fear the past?

925
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:19,470
虽然你是埃西铎的后代，但却不是埃西铎本人
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

926
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,030
你不会重蹈他的覆辙
You are not bound to his fate.

927
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,550
我跟他流着一样的血
The same blood flows in my veins.

928
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,160
一样的软弱
The same weakness.

929
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,590
你的时代即将来临
Your time will come.

930
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,230
你会面对同样的邪恶，然后击败它
You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it.

931
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,860
邪恶的力量并没有征服一切
The power of evil and not conquer us.

932
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,470
至少你我还没被征服
Not over you, not over me.

933
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:08,030
你还记得我们初次相识的场景吗？
Do you remember the first time we have met?

934
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,150
我以为我走进了一个梦境
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

935
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,190
过了这么多年
Long years have passed.

936
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:24,270
你不再年少轻狂
Had you not now concerns.

937
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,790
你还记得我当初许下了什么诺言吗？
Renech i beth i pennen?

938
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,470
你说你愿意嫁给我
You said you'd bind yourself to me,

939
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:43,500
放弃精灵永生不死的力量
forsaking the immortal life of your people.

940
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,550
我仍愿意这么做
And to that I hold.

941
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:50,380
我宁愿和你共度一生
I would rather share one lifetime with you

942
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,430
也不愿意面对永生不死的孤寂
than face all the Ages of this world alone.

943
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,670
我选择成为凡人
I choose a mortal Life.

944
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,270
-你不能给我这个  -这是我的选择
-You cannot give me this.  -It is mine to give to whom I will.

945
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,040
它代表我的心
Like my heart.

946
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,510
来自远方的陌生人，老朋友
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old,

947
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:41,670
你们被召集来商量该如何对抗魔多的威胁
you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.

948
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:47,180
中土世界正面临灭亡的命运，无人能幸免
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.

949
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,940
你们不团结一心，就会遭到毁灭
You will unite, or you will fall.

950
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:55,390
所有的种族都无法幸免
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

951
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,790
弗罗多，把魔戒拿来
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

952
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,550
预言果然是真的
So it is true.

953
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,110
在梦中
In a dream,

954
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,950
我看到东方的天空一片昏暗
I saw the eastern sky grow dark,

955
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,950
但西方仍有一丝微光
but in the West a pale light lingered.

956
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,550
一个声音轻唤着
A voice was crying.

957
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,710
你即将面临灭亡的命运
Your doom is near at hand.

958
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,470
埃西铎灾星再现人世
Isildur's Bane is found.

959
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,310
埃西铎的灾星
Isildur Bane.

960
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,810
波罗莫！
Boromir！

961
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:27,100
在伊姆拉崔，从未有人胆敢使用邪恶的语言
Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.

962
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,020
我不敢请您谅解，爱隆王
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond,

963
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,390
然而魔多的邪恶语言
for the Black Speech of Mordor,

964
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,070
可能很快就会
may yet be heard

965
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,110
响彻西方世界的每个角落
in every corner of the West!

966
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,030
至尊魔戒是彻头彻尾的邪恶之物
The Ring is altogether evil.

967
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,870
这是一项礼物
It is a gift.

968
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,550
一项对抗魔多的厚礼
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

969
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:48,270
我们为什么不能利用这枚戒指？
Why not use this Ring?

970
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,230
我的父亲，崇高的刚铎的摄政王
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor,

971
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:55,790
长久以来拒敌于河岸之外，用人民的鲜血
kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people

972
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,270
保卫着你们的安全
are your lands kept safe.

973
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:04,390
把敌人的武器交给刚铎，让我们利用它来对抗邪恶
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him.

974
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:08,340
你无法驾驭它，谁都不能
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

975
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:13,030
至尊魔戒只属于索伦，它没有第二个主人
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.

976
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:16,780
区区一个游侠能懂什么？
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?

977
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,070
他不是普通的游侠
This is no mere Ranger.

978
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:23,710
他是阿拉贡，阿拉桑之子
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

979
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,150
你必须效忠于他
You owe him your allegiance.

980
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,150
阿拉贡
Aragorn.

981
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,750
这位就是埃西铎的后代
This is Isildur heir?

982
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,830
也就是刚铎的王位继承人
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

983
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,390
坐下来，莱格拉斯
Havo dad, Legolas.

984
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:52,550
刚铎没有国王
Gondor has no king.

985
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,110
刚铎也不需要国王
Gondor needs no king.

986
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,470
阿拉贡说得对，魔戒不能被利用
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

987
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:10,990
你们只有一个选择
You have only one choice.

988
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,500
至尊魔戒一定要摧毁
The Ring must be destroyed.

989
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,360
那我们还等什么？
What are we waiting for?

990
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,510
魔戒不可能在这儿被摧毁，吉姆利，格洛因之子
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin,

991
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:40,910
这里的所有武器都无法摧毁它
by any craft that we here possess.

992
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:45,590
魔戒由末日火山的烈焰铸成
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

993
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:49,630
也只有在那儿才能摧毁它
Only there can it be unmade.

994
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,310
一定要深入魔多
It must be taken deep into Mordor

995
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:00,450
把魔戒扔到末日火山的烈焰中
and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.

996
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,470
你们其中一个
One of you

997
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,150
必须这么做
must do this.

998
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,780
我们不能就这样闯进魔多
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

999
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,310
除了有半兽人把守黑门
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.

1000
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:21,310
还有永不松懈的邪恶力量
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1001
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:25,750
索伦的邪眼更是虎视耽耽
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1002
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,550
那是一片死寂的荒原
It is a barren wasteland,

1003
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:32,350
布满烈焰，灰烬和尘埃
riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1004
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:36,390
光是空中就充满着致命的毒气
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1005
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,910
这不可能办到，即使千军万马也不可能
Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly.

1006
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:45,550
你没有听到爱隆王说的话吗？魔戒一定要被摧毁
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1007
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,360
所以你就像自告奋勇吗？
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1008
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:53,230
如果失败了怎么办，如果魔戒被索伦抢回去怎么办？
And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?

1009
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:58,710
我绝不容许魔戒落入精灵手中
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an EIf!

1010
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:03,180
精灵都不可靠！
Never trust an Elf!

1011
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:10,230
你们还不懂吗？你们在这里争论不休的时候，索伦的力量正与日俱增
Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1012
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,430
没有人能避开厄运，所有人都会灭亡！
None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed!

1013
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,430
我愿意
I will take it.

1014
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,960
我愿意
I will take it.

1015
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,830
我愿意把魔戒带到魔多
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1016
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,190
虽然
Though,

1017
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,110
我不知道怎么去
I do not know the way.

1018
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:08,430
我愿意帮助你，弗罗多巴金斯
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins,

1019
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:12,030
只要你愿意背负起这份重担
as Long as it is yours to bear.

1020
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,190
我会用我的生命来保卫你
If by my life or death I can protect you,

1021
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,270
我愿意
I will.

1022
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:23,830
我的剑会保护你
You have my sword.

1023
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,710
还有我的弓箭
And you have my bow.

1024
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,780
还有我的战斧
And my ax.

1025
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,790
你背负着大家的命运，小个子
You carry the fates of us all, Little one.

1026
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,470
如果这是大家的决定
If this is indeed the will of the Council,

1027
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,390
刚铎也会鼎力支持
then Gondor will see it done.

1028
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,750
-无论弗罗多去哪我也要跟着去  -拆散你们的确很难
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.  -It is hardly possible to separate you,

1029
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:01,820
连没份参加的秘密会议你都来了
even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.

1030
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:04,310
我们也要跟着去！
We're coming too!

1031
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,110
除非你把我们五花大绑送回家
You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.

1032
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,710
总之，你需要聪明人参与才行，无论你怎么称呼它
Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of

1033
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,350
任务也好
mission.

1034
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,990
冒险也好
Quest.

1035
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,510
玩意儿也好
Thing.

1036
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:22,110
你第一个就不合格，皮平
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1037
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:25,550
九名同伴
Nine companions.

1038
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,190
就这样吧
So be it.

1039
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,550
你们是魔戒远征队
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

1040
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,030
好极了
Great!

1041
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,510
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

1042
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,360
她想护佑她的子嗣
She wanted to protect her child.

1043
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:27,950
她以为你在瑞文戴尔会很安全
She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

1044
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:33,830
你母亲在内心深处明白，你终其一生都会被追杀
In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1045
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,990
这是你逃脱不了的命运
That you'd never escape your fate.

1046
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,180
精灵能够重铸人皇的圣剑
The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings,

1047
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:44,510
然而只有你才有力量驾驭它
but only you have the power to wield it.

1048
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,990
我不想拥有那种力量
I do not want that power.

1049
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,910
我从来都不想要它
I have never wanted it.

1050
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,790
你是王族血脉最后的传承，再没有别人了
You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other.

1051
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,670
我的宝剑！刺丁
My old sword! Sting.

1052
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,020
来，拿去，试试
Here, take it. Take it.

1053
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,430
-好轻啊  -没错，精灵铸的，名不虚传
-It's so light.  -Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1054
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:17,310
半兽人接近的时候，剑身就会发光
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.

1055
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,110
这样一来，你就要格外小心
And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.

1056
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,750
这玩意儿更棒
Here's a pretty thing.

1057
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,470
秘银
Mithril.

1058
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:31,630
轻若鸿毛，韧如龙麟
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

1059
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,110
让我看看你穿上是什么样，快试试
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1060
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,190
我的老戒指
My old ring.

1061
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,390
我真的很想
I should very much like

1062
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:54,630
再把它握在手中
to hold it again, one last time.

1063
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,620
我很抱歉把你卷进这件事，孩子
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

1064
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,070
很抱歉让你扛下这份重担
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1065
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,670
我对这一切都感到很抱歉
I'm sorry for everything.

1066
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:46,830
持戒者准备出发到末日火山
The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1067
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,790
与他一起出征的各位，不必许下任何诺言
On you who travel with him, no oath,

1068
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:54,150
也不受任何约定的束缚，你们随时都可以中断旅程
nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

1069
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:00,120
再会了，别忘了你们的使命
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1070
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:04,470
愿精灵与人类
May the blessings of Elves and Men

1071
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,670
以及所有自由之民的祝福与你们同行
and all Free Folk go with you.

1072
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:14,830
远征队等待持戒者启程
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1073
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,700
去魔多，甘道夫，是往左还是往右？
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1074
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:38,110
往左
Left.

1075
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:02,150
我们向迷雾山脉以西走四十天
We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1076
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:06,110
幸运的话，就能赶到洛汗隘口
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.

1077
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,860
再从那儿往东走到魔多
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1078
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,910
二，一，五。好，非常好！
Two, one, five. Good! Very good!

1079
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,750
脚步要快
Move your feet.

1080
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,310
-真棒，皮平  -谢谢
-You look good, Pippin.  -Thanks.

1081
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:19,910
再快一点！
Faster!

1082
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:25,030
虽然你们都不问我的意见
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not,

1083
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,990
我还是要说我们在绕远路
I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1084
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:31,590
甘道夫，我们可以穿过摩瑞亚矿坑
Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.

1085
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:36,110
我表哥巴林一定会热烈的欢迎我们
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1086
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:41,630
不行，吉姆利，别无选择才能走摩瑞亚矿坑
No, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.

1087
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,060
对不起
Sorry!

1088
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,270
绊倒他
Get him!

1089
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,190
-夏尔万岁！  -把他压住，压住他，梅里！
-For the Shire!  -Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1090
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:01,110
好了，各位
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1091
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,510
你抓住我了，你抓住我了！
You've got my arm! You've got my arm!

1092
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,590
-那是什么？  -没什么，只是一朵乌云
-What is that?  -Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1093
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,510
它移动的很快
It's moving fast.

1094
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,910
还迎着风
Against the wind.

1095
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:17,790
-是登兰德的乌鸦！  -快躲起来！
-Crebain from Dunland!  -Hide!

1096
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,750
-快点！  -快躲起来！
-Hurry!  -Take cover!

1097
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,870
萨鲁曼的眼线
Spies of Saruman.

1098
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:59,950
南方的路受到监视
The passage south is being watched.

1099
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:04,390
我们一定要攀越卡兰拉斯山
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1100
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,750
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1101
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:40,020
波罗莫
Boromir.

1102
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:44,430
我们受尽了恐惧和疑虑的折磨
It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt

1103
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:47,790
就为了这小玩意儿
over so small a thing.

1104
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,950
这小小的玩意儿
Such a little thing.

1105
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,630
波罗莫！
Boromir!

1106
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,910
把魔戒还给弗罗多
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1107
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,790
遵命
As you wish.

1108
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,550
我才不要它
I care not.

1109
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,630
甘道夫，你想带领他们越过卡兰拉斯山
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1110
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:57,430
要是失败，你还能去哪儿？
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1111
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:01,670
要是你被这崇山峻岭打败
If the mountain defeats you,

1112
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:06,350
你肯冒更大的风险吗？
will you risk a more dangerous road?

1113
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:21,630
空气中有可怕的声音！
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!

1114
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,190
那是萨鲁曼！
It's Saruman!

1115
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:37,790
他想造成山崩，我们一定要回头，甘道夫！
He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back!

1116
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,830
不行！
No!

1117
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:48,110
我们一定要下山！
We must get off the mountain!

1118
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,910
赶到洛汗隘口，从西边走到我的城市！
Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!

1119
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:56,510
洛汗隘口离艾辛格太近了
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

1120
01:56:56,720 --> 01:57:00,420
上面走不成，就走下面吧
We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it.

1121
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:03,470
让我们穿过摩瑞亚矿坑
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1122
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:09,150
摩瑞亚，你很怕穿过矿坑
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1123
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:14,870
矮人太贪心，挖的太深
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1124
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:20,500
你知道他们在卡萨杜姆的黑暗中唤醒了什么
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dum,

1125
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,310
邪恶的炎魔
Shadow and flame.

1126
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,430
让魔戒持有者决定
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1127
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,230
我们不能再留在这儿了！
We cannot stay here!

1128
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:41,190
霍比特人会死在这儿的！
This will be the death of the Hobbits!

1129
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:43,030
弗罗多？
Frodo?

1130
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:48,990
我们就走矿坑吧
We will go through the mines.

1131
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,550
就这样吧
So be it.

1132
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:02,150
弗罗多，过来帮帮我这个老头子吧
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1133
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,910
你的肩膀还好吗？
How is your shoulders?

1134
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:11,350
-比之前好多了  -魔戒呢？
-Better than it was.  -And the Ring?

1135
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,470
你感觉到那股力量越来越强大了，对不对？
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1136
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,830
我也感觉到了。你一定要小心
I've felt it too. You must be careful now.

1137
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:23,150
邪恶不仅仅来源于远征队之外
Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.

1138
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,920
恐怕也会来自于远征队内部
And, I fear, from within.

1139
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,670
-我该相信谁？  -你一定要相信你自己
-Who then do I trust?  -You must trust yourself.

1140
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:35,710
相信你本身的力量
Trust your own strengths.

1141
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:38,470
-什么意思？  -这世界有许多不同的力量
-What do you mean?  -There are many powers in this world,

1142
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:40,750
或善或恶
for good or for evil.

1143
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,230
其中的一些比我的力量还强大
Some are greater than I am.

1144
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:47,390
有些我也从未遭遇过
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1145
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,150
摩瑞亚的
The walls

1146
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,950
巨墙
of Moria.

1147
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:01,670
矮人大门关闭的时候是隐形的
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1148
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:06,350
对，吉姆利，如果忘记了谜语，连主人自己都找不到
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.

1149
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:09,140
我为什么一点儿也不觉得惊讶？
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1150
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:20,470
让我看看
Well, let's see.

1151
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:22,110
伊希尔丁金属
Ithildin.

1152
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:26,110
它只反射星光和月光
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1153
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:44,270
上面写着，杜林之门，摩瑞亚之主
It reads, The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

1154
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:49,470
-开口说，朋友，然后进入  -那是什么意思？
-Speak, friend, and enter.  -What do you suppose that means?

1155
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:54,430
很简单，如果是朋友，说出暗语门就开了
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.

1156
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:19,340
没有动静
Nothing's happening.

1157
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:30,590
我曾经很熟悉精灵，人类甚至是半兽人
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves,

1158
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,630
所有语言中的咒语
Men and Orcs.

1159
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:35,140
那你现在要怎么办？
What are you going to do, then?

1160
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:37,590
用你的脑袋把大门撞开，皮瑞格林·图克！
Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!

1161
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,790
如果那样还没用的话
And if that does not shatter them

1162
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,670
你就不要用这么蠢的问题来打扰我
and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions.

1163
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:46,350
我会想办法找出咒语的
I will try to find the opening words.

1164
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:01,760
马儿不能进入矿坑
Mines are no place for a pony.

1165
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:07,300
-就算像比尔一样勇敢也不行  -再见了，比尔
-Even one so brave as Bill.  -Bye-bye, Bill.

1166
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:10,070
去吧，比尔，去吧
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1167
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:14,180
放心，山姆，它知道回家的路
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1168
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,560
别玩水
Do not disturb the water.

1169
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,630
噢，完全没用
Oh, it's useless.

1170
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,510
这是一个谜语
It's a riddle.

1171
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:46,390
开口说"朋友"，然后进入
Speak "friend" and enter.

1172
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:49,670
"朋友"用精灵语怎么说？
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1173
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:52,390
Mellon（精灵语）
Mellon.

1174
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:15,300
很快，精灵，你就能见识我们矮人族的热情
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1175
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:21,510
熊熊的火焰，清凉的啤酒，还有大块的烤肉
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

1176
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,070
朋友，这里就是我表哥巴林的家
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

1177
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,820
就是他们所谓的矿坑
And they call it a mine.

1178
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,990
一座巨大的矿坑！
A mine!

1179
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:35,390
这根本不是矿坑，这是坟墓
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1180
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,110
不！
No!

1181
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:46,030
不！
No!

1182
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:50,190
地精
Goblins.

1183
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:58,390
我们应该去洛汗隘口，我们根本就不该来这儿的
We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.

1184
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,030
快走，快出去！
Now! get out of here. Get out!

1185
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,190
-弗罗多！  -救救我！
-Frodo!  -Help!

1186
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,990
神行客！
Strider!

1187
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:11,950
-快救救我！  -放开他！
-Help!  -Get off him!

1188
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:13,220
阿拉贡！
Aragorn!

1189
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:24,670
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1190
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,030
快进矿坑！
Into the mines!

1191
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:55,470
-莱格拉斯！  -快进矿坑！
-Legolas!  -Into the cave!

1192
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,510
快跑！
Run!

1193
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:21,990
我们现在只剩下一个选择了
We now have but one choice.

1194
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:27,060
我们一定要穿过黑暗的摩瑞亚矿坑
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1195
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:29,270
提高警觉
Be on your guard.

1196
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:32,910
在这个黑暗的地底世界
There are older and fouler things than Orcs

1197
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:36,660
有比半兽人更可怕的怪物
in the deep places of the world.

1198
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:48,550
安静，要走四天才能到另一边
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1199
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:52,590
希望我们不会惊动什么
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1200
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:42,070
摩瑞亚的财富不在于金矿
The wealth of Moria was not in gold

1201
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:44,660
或珠宝
or jewels,

1202
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:47,910
而是秘银
but mithril.

1203
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:11,140
比尔博有一件秘银罩衫，是索林送给他的
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.

1204
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:15,310
-噢，那可是极其尊贵的礼物  -的确如此
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.  -Yes.

1205
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,390
我从来没跟他说过
I never told him,

1206
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:22,540
那件衣服足以买下整个夏尔
but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.

1207
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,710
皮平
Pippin.

1208
02:06:57,080 --> 02:07:00,070
我不记得这地方
I have no memory of this place.

1209
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,470
-我们迷路了吗？  -不是
-Are we lost?  -No.

1210
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:06,220
-我想我们是迷路了  -甘道夫正在想呢
-I think we are.  -Gandalf's thinking.

1211
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:07,910
-梅里  -干嘛？
-Merry?  -What?

1212
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:10,070
我饿了
I'm hungry.

1213
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,870
-下面有动静  -那是咕噜
-There's something down there.  -It's Gollum.

1214
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:30,190
-咕噜？  -他跟了我们三天了
-Gollum?  -He's been following us for three days.

1215
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:34,590
-他从巴拉多的地牢逃出来了？  -逃出来？
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?  -Escaped,

1216
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,950
或是被放出来的吧
or was set loose.

1217
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:41,110
现在魔戒吸引他到这儿来
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1218
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:46,430
他永远渴望拥有魔戒
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1219
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:52,310
他对魔戒又爱又恨，就像他对自己爱恨交加
He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.

1220
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:57,420
斯美戈的一生是很悲惨的故事
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1221
02:07:57,640 --> 02:08:03,550
是的，在魔戒引诱他之前，他叫斯美戈
Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the Ring found him.

1222
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,310
在魔戒让他发狂之前
Before it drove him mad.

1223
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:10,470
可惜比尔博当时有机会却没杀了他
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.

1224
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:11,830
可惜？
Pity?

1225
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:15,830
比尔博是可怜他才没杀他
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1226
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:21,990
有很多活人本来就该死，也有些死人命不该绝
Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life.

1227
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,870
你能做这种判断吗，弗罗多？
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1228
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:32,230
千万别轻易断定别人的生死
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.

1229
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:35,350
就连智者都无法决定命运
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1230
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:41,870
我直觉地认为不管是好是坏，咕噜都会跟这趟探险有关
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill,

1231
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:45,550
在这一切结束前
before this is over.

1232
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:50,870
比尔博的同情心影响了很多人
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1233
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,910
我真希望魔戒没在我手中
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1234
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:04,350
我真希望这一切都没发生
I wish none of this had happened.

1235
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:09,630
每个人遇到难关都会这么想，但是我们却无法决定自己的命运
So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide.

1236
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:15,910
我们要决定的是在苦难中该如何选择
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.

1237
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:21,430
弗罗多，世上除了邪恶以外还有别的力量
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1238
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:24,230
比尔博注定要找到魔戒
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1239
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:29,030
你也注定要得到它
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

1240
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:32,430
能这么想就好了
And that is an encouraging thought.

1241
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:39,230
是这个方向
It's that way.

1242
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,710
-他记起来了  -没有
-He's remembered.  -No.

1243
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:45,710
但这儿的空气没那么糟
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1244
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:51,150
梅利阿道克，要是迷了路，跟着鼻子走就对了
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

1245
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:10,110
让我冒点险再弄亮一点
Let me risk a little more light.

1246
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,830
看吧
Behold,

1247
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:22,550
这就是宏伟的矮人故乡摩瑞亚
the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1248
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,430
真是令人大开眼界
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1249
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:55,110
吉姆利！
Gimli!

1250
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:04,150
不！
No!

1251
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:09,870
哦，不！
Oh, no.

1252
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:12,990
不
No.

1253
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:22,230
巴林长眠于此
Here lies Balin,

1254
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:24,710
方丁之子
son of Fundin,

1255
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,670
摩瑞亚之王
Lord of Moria.

1256
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:30,390
他死了
He is dead, then.

1257
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:33,830
果然和我担心的一样
It's as I feared.

1258
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:54,950
我们快走吧，别在这儿逗留
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1259
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:59,870
他们攻下桥梁和第二大厅
They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1260
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,550
我们拴住大门
We have barred the gates,

1261
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,710
却阻挡不了他们
but cannot hold them for long.

1262
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:09,710
大地在撼动
The ground shakes.

1263
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:11,710
鼓声
Drums,

1264
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:15,470
地底深处传来鼓声
drums in the deep.

1265
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:21,070
我们逃不出去
We cannot get out.

1266
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:26,910
黑暗中有一个阴影
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1267
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:31,190
我们逃不出去
We cannot get out.

1268
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,070
他们来了
They are coming.

1269
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:20,950
你这个蠢小子！
Fool of a Took!

1270
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:25,100
下次你自己也跳下去算了，免得我们都被你给害死
Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.

1271
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:52,750
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1272
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:56,510
半兽人
Orcs.

1273
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,550
退后，紧跟着甘道夫！
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1274
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:14,590
他们有一只食人妖
They have a cave-troll.

1275
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,540
让他们来受死吧！
Let them come!

1276
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:35,590
摩瑞亚还有最后一个矮人
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.

1277
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:57,230
我越来越厉害了
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1278
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,710
弗罗多
Frodo!

1279
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:39,110
阿拉贡！阿拉贡！
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1280
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:41,990
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1281
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:29,030
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1282
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,310
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1283
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:30,550
哦，不
Oh, no.

1284
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:40,870
他还活着
He's alive.

1285
02:19:43,320 --> 02:19:46,270
我没事，我没受伤
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1286
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,710
你应该没命的
You should be dead.

1287
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:51,430
那一剑连野猪都能刺穿
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1288
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:56,390
小霍比特人远远比我们想象的厉害
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.

1289
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:03,310
秘银
Mithril.

1290
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:08,710
你真是叫人惊讶，巴金斯先生
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1291
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:16,670
快到卡萨杜姆桥！
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!

1292
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:33,390
这边！
This way!

1293
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:46,750
又来了什么怪物？
What is this new devilry?

1294
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,590
炎魔
A Balrog.

1295
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,070
远古的恶魔
A demon of the ancient world.

1296
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:13,660
你们都不是他的对手
This foe is beyond any of you.

1297
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,430
快跑！
Run!

1298
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:25,270
快！
Quickly!

1299
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:43,190
甘道夫
Gandalf.

1300
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,390
你领着他们，阿拉贡
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1301
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:49,310
桥就快到了
The bridge is near.

1302
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:55,470
照我说的做！剑是无法对付炎魔的
Do as I say! Swords are no more use here.

1303
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:26,350
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

1304
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:45,870
梅里，皮平！
Merry! Pippin!

1305
02:23:56,960 --> 02:23:58,510
山姆！
Sam!

1306
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:04,470
谁也不能丢矮人
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1307
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:08,910
别抓着我的胡子！
Not the beard!

1308
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,070
稳着点
Steady.

1309
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:27,830
稳住！
Hold on!

1310
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:50,100
稳住！
Hang on!

1311
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:02,590
往前倾！
Lean forward!

1312
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:06,630
稳着点
Steady.

1313
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:09,100
来吧！
Come on!

1314
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:10,830
趁现在！
Now!

1315
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,830
快过桥！
Over the bridge!

1316
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:31,630
快过去！
Fly!

1317
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:18,270
你不能过来！
You cannot pass!

1318
02:26:18,480 --> 02:26:20,070
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

1319
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:29,180
我是圣火的仆人，高举着亚尔诺的炽焰
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

1320
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:33,980
暗夜之火不会助你，邪恶的乌顿之火！
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

1321
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,910
滚回黑暗中吧
Go back to the Shadow.

1322
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:58,230
你不能过来！
You shall not pass!

1323
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:29,270
-不！不！  -甘道夫！
-No! No!  -Gandalf!

1324
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:39,380
你们快走吧！
Fly, you fools!

1325
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,670
不！
No!

1326
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:53,990
阿拉贡！
Aragorn!

1327
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:54,070
莱格拉斯，把他们扶起来
Legolas, get them up.

1328
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,030
你就让他们静一会儿吧！
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1329
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:03,870
天一黑，半兽人就会蜂拥而上
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.

1330
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:07,430
我们一定要赶到萝斯洛林
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.

1331
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:11,630
走吧，波罗莫，莱格拉斯，吉姆利，把他们扶起来
Come, Boromir. Legolas. Gimli, get them up.

1332
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:15,350
站起来，山姆
On your feet, Sam.

1333
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:17,190
弗罗多？
Frodo?

1334
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:20,950
弗罗多!
Frodo!

1335
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:15,990
跟紧了，小霍比特人！
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1336
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:20,870
传言这里住着一名可怕的女巫
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.

1337
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:23,640
她是一个精灵
An Elf-witch

1338
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:27,070
拥有可怕的力量
of terrible power.

1339
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:29,790
任何人只要看她一眼
All who look upon her,

1340
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:31,790
就会被她蛊惑
fall under her spell.

1341
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:33,310
弗罗多
Frodo

1342
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:37,590
然后永远消失
And are never seen again.

1343
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:42,310
你来到这里，带着毁灭的信息
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.

1344
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:46,220
你将邪恶之物携带至此，魔戒持有者
You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.

1345
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:48,190
弗罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

1346
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:59,070
哼，她可蛊惑不了我这矮人
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1347
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:03,830
我有老鹰的眼睛，狐狸的耳朵
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1348
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:16,110
这矮子太聒噪 ，就算闭着眼睛也能毙了他
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.

1349
02:31:20,110 --> 02:31:23,450
欢迎莱格拉斯，瑟兰督伊之子
Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.

1350
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:27,500
护戒队需要您的帮助
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1351
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:31,310
登丹人阿拉贡
Aragorn of the Dunedain,

1352
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:33,880
我们久仰你的大名
you are known to us.

1353
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,510
你们精灵不是一直都很有礼貌吗？
So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves

1354
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:38,590
说我们都听得懂的话！
Speak words we can all understand!

1355
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:43,390
从黑暗时代起我们就再没有和矮人打过交道
We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1356
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:46,200
你知道矮人会怎么说吗？
And you know what this Dwarf says to that?

1357
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:54,990
那很没有礼貌
That was not so courteous.

1358
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:05,550
你带来了强大的邪恶力量
You bring great evil with you.

1359
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:09,550
你们不能再继续前行
You can go no further.

1360
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:49,590
甘道夫不能白白牺牲
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1361
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:52,630
他也不会要你放弃希望
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1362
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:57,470
弗罗多，你肩负着重任
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1363
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:01,430
不要让忧伤阻碍你的道路
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1364
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:06,310
跟我来
You will follow me.

1365
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:19,990
卡拉斯·加拉顿
Cares Galeton.

1366
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:23,510
中土世界的精灵故乡
The heart of Envenom on earth.

1367
02:33:23,720 --> 02:33:29,390
精灵之王凯勒鹏与光之女王凯兰崔尔的王国
Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1368
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:51,590
敌人已经知道了你们的行踪
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1369
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:57,430
你们的努力白费了
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1370
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:03,630
这儿只有八个人， 但是有九人从瑞文戴尔出发
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.

1371
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:05,670
告诉我，甘道夫在哪儿？
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1372
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:08,950
我要同他讲话
For I much desire to speak with him.

1373
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:11,950
我从远方就看不到他了
I can no longer see him from afar.

1374
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:18,030
灰袍巫师甘道夫没能越过这里的边界
Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.

1375
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:20,710
他已经坠入黑暗的深渊
He has fallen into Shadow.

1376
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:29,910
被暗影与烈焰吞没
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1377
02:35:31,560 --> 02:35:35,260
是魔苟斯的炎魔
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1378
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,350
因为我们冒失的闯入摩瑞亚的陷阱之中
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

1379
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:44,750
甘道夫一生都不会冒不必要的风险
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

1380
02:35:45,400 --> 02:35:48,670
我们还无法知悉他的用意为何
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1381
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:57,710
不要让卡萨督姆的悲伤使你们垂头丧气
Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dum fill your heart.

1382
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:00,270
吉姆利，格洛因之子
Gimli, son of Gloin.

1383
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:04,790
这世界充满凶险
For the world has grown full of peril

1384
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:08,910
到处都是困难重重
and in all lands,

1385
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:12,590
你们心中充满着悲伤
love is now mingled with grief.

1386
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:27,950
魔戒远征队将何去何从？
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1387
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:31,510
没有甘道夫，他们毫无希望
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1388
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:37,710
这趟旅程险象环生
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1389
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:41,030
只要稍加疏忽就会彻底失败
Stray but a little and it will fail

1390
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:44,590
世界也终将毁灭
to the ruin of all.

1391
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:54,790
然而只要你们精诚一致就有希望
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.

1392
02:36:56,320 --> 02:37:01,070
别动摇内心的坚定，快去休息吧
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest

1393
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:05,150
你们有太多的哀伤和疲惫
for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1394
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:09,550
今晚，你们将会安眠
Tonight, you will sleep.

1395
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:13,270
欢迎，夏尔的弗罗多
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire,

1396
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:16,510
只有你一人见过邪眼
one who has seen the Eye!

1397
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:33,720
他们在为甘道夫唱挽歌
A lament for Gandalf.

1398
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,510
歌词里都说了些什么？
What do they say about him?

1399
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:45,390
我不忍心告诉你
I have not the heart to tell you.

1400
02:37:48,280 --> 02:37:50,550
我的伤痛尚未愈合
For me, the grief is still too near.

1401
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:56,310
他们一定没提到甘道夫的焰火
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1402
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:59,550
他们应该作诗来歌颂这一点
There should be a verse about them.

1403
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:05,110
举世无匹最绚烂的焰火
The finest rockets ever seen.

1404
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,070
在空中闪烁就像耀眼的星斗
They burst in stars of blue and green.

1405
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:15,190
华丽宛如漫天之星辰
Or after thunder, silver showers.

1406
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:18,630
散落如同缤纷的花雨
Came falling like a rain of flowers.

1407
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:22,790
这都无法形容这焰火有多壮观
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

1408
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:36,110
休息吧
Take some rest.

1409
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:38,990
这里很安全
These borders are well-protected.

1410
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:41,750
我在这里无法入眠
I will find no rest here.

1411
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:47,590
我听到她的声音
I heard her voice inside my head.

1412
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:51,540
她提到我祖辈和刚铎覆亡的命运
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1413
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:57,230
她说，现在仍有一线希望
She said to me, "even now there is hope left."

1414
02:38:58,600 --> 02:39:01,430
但是我却看不到
But I cannot see it.

1415
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:05,260
我们长久以来都毫无希望可言
It is long since we had any hope.

1416
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:17,590
我父亲拥有高贵的情操
My father is a noble man.

1417
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:20,590
但他无法统治刚铎
But his rule is failing

1418
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:26,350
人民也失去信心
and our people lose faith.

1419
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:31,270
他希望我能成功，我也希望
He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.

1420
02:39:31,480 --> 02:39:35,020
我想要重建刚铎的荣耀
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1421
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:40,870
你曾经见过吗？阿拉贡
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1422
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:43,470
爱克西里昂的白塔
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1423
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:47,500
像珍珠和白银一般闪闪发亮
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1424
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:51,710
塔上的旗帜随风飘扬
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1425
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:56,550
你有没有听过
Have you ever been called home

1426
02:39:56,760 --> 02:40:00,670
银色号角响亮的召唤声？
by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1427
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:04,550
圣白城
I have seen the White City

1428
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:06,390
我很久以前曾经去过
long ago.

1429
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:12,300
有一天，我们会一起去那儿
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1430
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:16,190
护城的守卫将高喊
And the tower guard shall take up the call,

1431
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:19,990
刚铎之主回来了
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1432
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:29,660
你想看看镜子么？
Will you look into the mirror?

1433
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:31,430
我会看到什么？
What will I see?

1434
02:41:34,400 --> 02:41:36,700
即使最聪明的智者也不能断言
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1435
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:39,470
因为镜子
For the mirror

1436
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:42,240
能显现各种事情
shows many things.

1437
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:47,590
过去的事情
Things that were,

1438
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:50,400
现在的事情
things that are,

1439
02:41:51,160 --> 02:41:53,110
还有一些
and some things

1440
02:41:56,720 --> 02:42:00,030
尚未发生的事情
that have not yet come to pass.

1441
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:25,430
我知道你看到什么
I know what it is you saw.

1442
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:30,430
那一幕也在我心中呈现
For it is also in my mind.

1443
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:36,270
如果你失败就会发生这些事
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

1444
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:43,500
魔戒远征队已经开始四分五裂
The Fellowship is breaking. It is already begun.

1445
02:43:44,160 --> 02:43:47,430
他会试图抢走魔戒
He will try to take the Ring.

1446
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:49,630
你知道我说的是谁
You know of whom I speak.

1447
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:55,310
他们会一一被魔戒击垮
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1448
02:43:56,840 --> 02:43:59,270
你要的话
If you ask it of me,

1449
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:02,750
我就把至尊魔戒给你
I will give you the One Ring.

1450
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:05,950
你肯毫无条件的把它给我？
You offer it to me freely？

1451
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:14,470
我承认我很想要魔戒
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.

1452
02:44:20,840 --> 02:44:24,150
我将成为魔戒之后
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen,

1453
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:28,380
并不黑暗而无比的美丽，像初生的曙光一样耀眼
not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!

1454
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:32,070
跟海洋一样高深莫测
Treacherous as the sea!

1455
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:37,470
远比大地更加深厚
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1456
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:40,310
世人都将绝望的爱我
All shall love me

1457
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:43,350
而且自暴自弃
and despair.

1458
02:44:57,480 --> 02:44:59,490
我通过了试炼
I pass the test.

1459
02:45:00,090 --> 02:45:04,510
我会退隐到西方
I will diminish and go into the West

1460
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:09,190
-继续当凯兰崔尔女王  -我一个人无法摧毁它
-and remain Galadriel.  -I cannot do this alone.

1461
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:16,950
你是魔戒持有者，弗罗多，持有至尊魔戒
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power

1462
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:19,350
就必须孤单一个人
is to be alone.

1463
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:25,470
这是钻石魔戒南雅
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.

1464
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:27,230
我是它的持有者
And I am its keeper.

1465
02:45:30,480 --> 02:45:34,070
这是注定属于你的命运
This task was appointed to you.

1466
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:37,990
如果你办不到
And if you do not find a way,

1467
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:41,230
任何人都无法办到
no one will.

1468
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:44,750
我知道该怎么做了
Then I know what I must do.

1469
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:46,630
只是
It's just.

1470
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:52,150
我感到害怕
I'm afraid to do it.

1471
02:45:55,640 --> 02:46:00,790
即便再渺小的人也能够改变未来
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.

1472
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:11,870
你知道半兽人是怎么来的吗
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?

1473
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:15,950
他们曾经是精灵
They were Elves once.

1474
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:20,470
但是却被黑暗的力量
Taken by the Dark Powers

1475
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:23,830
折磨到不成人形
tortured and mutilated.

1476
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:29,470
他们是被扭曲的可怕生物
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1477
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:31,590
现在，却在我的手中
And now

1478
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:34,950
达到完美境界
perfected.

1479
02:46:35,640 --> 02:46:38,830
我的强兽人战士
My fighting Uruk-hai,

1480
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:43,070
你的主人是谁？
whom do you serve?

1481
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:45,790
萨鲁曼！
Saruman!

1482
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:10,070
猎杀他们，找不到他们绝不罢手
Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found.

1483
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:13,190
你们没有痛苦，也没有恐惧
You do not know pain. You do not know fear.

1484
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:16,350
你们只会杀人！
You will taste Man-flesh!

1485
02:47:21,400 --> 02:47:25,070
有一个半身人携带着价值连城的东西
One of the halflings carries something of great value.

1486
02:47:25,280 --> 02:47:29,510
我要毫发无损的抓到他
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1487
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:32,590
杀了其他人
Kill the others.

1488
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:57,230
我们从未让外人穿戴上我们的衣裳
Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.

1489
02:47:58,360 --> 02:48:02,140
希望披风能保护你们不受邪眼侵扰
May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.

1490
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:10,990
兰巴斯
Lembas.

1491
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:12,830
精灵的行路面包
Elvish waybread.

1492
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:18,350
一小口就可以填饱一个成人
One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.

1493
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:26,710
你吃了多少？
How many did you eat?

1494
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:28,590
四个
Four.

1495
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:36,990
每往南方前进一步，危险就增加一分
Every league you travel south, the danger will increase.

1496
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:41,270
魔多的半兽人已经占领了安都因河岸
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.

1497
02:48:41,480 --> 02:48:43,990
西岸也不再安全
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

1498
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:47,980
萨鲁曼的白掌部队曾在我们的边界出没
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand have been seen on our borders.

1499
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:53,270
一般的半兽人不能在烈日下行动，但这些怪物却可以
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.

1500
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:04,550
他们正在猎杀你们
You are being tracked.

1501
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:10,590
只有从水路走你们才有机会赶在敌人之前到达拉洛斯瀑布
By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1502
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:32,670
我给你的礼物，莱格拉斯，是凯兰崔姆神弓
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1503
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:36,350
它能让你拥有百步穿杨的绝技
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

1504
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:44,140
这是诺多精灵的匕首
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1505
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:48,350
曾在战场上杀敌无数
They have already seen service in war.

1506
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:50,790
不要恐惧，皮瑞格林·图克
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1507
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,310
你会找到你的勇气
You will find your courage.

1508
02:49:56,200 --> 02:49:58,150
而给你的礼物，山姆卫斯·甘吉
And for you, Samwise Gamgee,

1509
02:49:58,360 --> 02:50:00,870
是用希斯蓝精灵绳索
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1510
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:03,190
谢谢您，女王
Thank you, my lady.

1511
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:08,350
这些匕首还有多的吗？
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

1512
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:17,790
矮人想从精灵这边要什么样的礼物？
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?

1513
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,110
什么也不要
Nothing.

1514
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:24,070
只求能再看一眼凯兰崔姆女王的容颜
Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time,

1515
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:29,910
她的美貌比地底所有的珍宝美钻都更加摄人魂魄
for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1516
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,510
其实
Actually,

1517
02:50:38,720 --> 02:50:40,350
有一项东西
there was one thing.

1518
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:43,830
不过，我不敢奢想，这是不可能的礼物
No, no, I couIdn't. It's quite impossible.

1519
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:46,830
我也不该开口
Stupid to ask.

1520
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:51,430
我不能再给你任何的东西
I have nothing greater to give

1521
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:55,220
因为你已经拥有了最珍贵的礼物
than the gift you already bear.

1522
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:57,540
亚玟的爱
For her love,

1523
02:50:58,840 --> 02:51:04,150
但是我怕亚玟会越来越虚弱
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.

1524
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:08,270
我会要她远离中土世界
I would have her leave these shores,

1525
02:51:09,800 --> 02:51:12,710
和她的族人住在一起
and be with her people.

1526
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:20,430
我会要她乘船到瓦林诺
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1527
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:23,750
她会做出她的选择
That choice is yet before her.

1528
02:51:24,520 --> 02:51:27,390
你自己也有抉择要做，阿拉贡
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1529
02:51:27,720 --> 02:51:33,510
重建伊伦迪尔时代以来你父辈的辉煌成就
To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of EIendil,

1530
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:38,070
或是跟着你最后的族人坠入绝望的深渊
or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.

1531
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:46,630
再会
Farewell.

1532
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:53,870
你的力量远远不止于此
There is much you have yet to do.

1533
02:51:56,220 --> 02:52:05,110
但我们不会再见面了，伊力萨王
We shall not meet again, Elessar.

1534
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:08,830
再见了，弗罗多·巴金斯
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1535
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:12,430
我将埃兰迪尔之光赠予你
I give you the light of Earendil,

1536
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:15,500
她是我们最挚爱的星辰
our most beloved star.

1537
02:52:24,680 --> 02:52:29,070
愿它在所有光亮黯淡之时
May it be a light for you in dark places,

1538
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:33,430
在黑暗中为你照亮光明
when all other lights go out.

1539
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:45,550
再不会有更加哀伤的离别了
I have taken my worst wound at this parting

1540
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:50,470
这是我最后一眼见世界上最美丽的容颜
having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

1541
02:52:51,240 --> 02:52:54,550
从此之后，所有的东西都不会比她给予的礼物更加的美丽
Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.

1542
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:56,750
她给你的礼物是什么？
What was her gift?

1543
02:52:56,960 --> 02:53:01,870
我跟她要一根她的金发
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

1544
02:53:02,680 --> 02:53:05,550
她给了我三根
She gave me three.

1545
02:54:47,720 --> 02:54:51,150
是咕噜，他从摩瑞亚开始就一直跟着我们
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1546
02:54:54,920 --> 02:54:57,990
我还以为在河上就能甩掉他
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1547
02:54:58,240 --> 02:55:01,390
没想到他水性这么好
But he's too clever a waterman.

1548
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:05,470
如果他让敌人知道我们现在在哪
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts,

1549
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:07,910
我们渡河就更危险了
it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1550
02:55:08,120 --> 02:55:10,150
吃点东西吧，弗罗多
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1551
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:13,430
-不了，山姆  -你一整天都没吃东西
-No, Sam.  -You haven't eaten anything all day.

1552
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:16,750
你也睡不着，不要以为我没有注意到
You're not sleeping, neither. Don't think I haven't noticed.

1553
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:20,670
-弗罗多先生  -我很好
-Mr. Frodo.  -I'm all right.

1554
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:22,060
但是你不好
But you're not.

1555
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:24,830
我是来帮助你的
I'm here to help you.

1556
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:26,750
我跟甘道夫保证过我会帮助你
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1557
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:35,470
你帮不上忙的，山姆
You can't help me, Sam.

1558
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:39,350
这次帮不上
Not this time.

1559
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:44,350
睡一会儿吧
Get some sleep.

1560
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:52,790
米纳斯提里斯比较安全
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1561
02:55:53,320 --> 02:55:56,070
你知道的，那里我们可以重整力量
You know that. From there we can regroup.

1562
02:55:56,760 --> 02:55:58,990
然后再一鼓作气攻向魔多
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1563
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:02,110
刚铎无法帮助我们
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1564
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:04,590
你倒是很容易就相信了精灵
You were quick enough to trust the Elves.

1565
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:09,270
你对你的子民就这么没有信心嘛？
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1566
02:56:09,480 --> 02:56:12,430
对，他们的力量很薄弱，意志也不够坚定
Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty.

1567
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:15,990
但是人类拥有无比的勇气和高贵的情操
But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.

1568
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:18,390
但是你却无视这一点
But you will not see that.

1569
02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:20,150
你很恐惧
You are afraid!

1570
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:22,990
你这一辈子都躲在阴影下
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1571
02:56:23,240 --> 02:56:26,710
拒绝承认自己的身份
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1572
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:33,510
我绝不会把魔戒带到你的城市
I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.

1573
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:46,670
弗罗多
Frodo.

1574
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:50,070
亚苟纳斯巨像
The Argonath.

1575
02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:57,220
我一直都想仰望过往伟大君王
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1576
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,910
我的父辈们
My kin.

1577
02:58:18,960 --> 02:58:21,150
天一黑就过湖
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1578
02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:23,950
把船藏好再改用步行
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1579
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:27,590
-我们从北面进入魔多  -哦，是吗？
-We approach Mordor from the North.  -Oh, yes?

1580
02:58:27,960 --> 02:58:31,740
那就仅仅是通过艾明莫尔而已喽？
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil?

1581
02:58:31,960 --> 02:58:35,190
那是充满尖石的迷宫
An impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1582
02:58:35,400 --> 02:58:38,510
然后呢，就更精彩了
And after that, it gets even better.

1583
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:43,780
那儿有一望无际的臭沼泽地
Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.

1584
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,430
那就是我们要走的路
That is our road.

1585
02:58:46,960 --> 02:58:50,110
我建议你好好休息，养精蓄锐，矮人先生
I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1586
02:58:50,360 --> 02:58:52,070
养精蓄锐个头
Recover my.

1587
02:58:55,120 --> 02:58:57,070
-我们最好马上启程  -不行
-We should leave now.  -No.

1588
02:58:57,280 --> 02:59:01,670
半兽人在巡逻东岸，一定要等到天黑再出发
Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.

1589
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:05,350
我担心的不是东岸
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1590
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:09,550
我心中一直有一个阴影，一个逐步靠近的威胁
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.

1591
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:14,270
危险正在逼近，我感觉得到
Something draws near. I can feel it.

1592
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:21,180
矮人族精力旺盛吃苦耐劳，别理他，小霍比特人
Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1593
02:59:21,720 --> 02:59:23,430
弗罗多呢？
Where's Frodo?

1594
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:50,990
我们都不该一个人乱跑
None of us should wander alone.

1595
02:59:52,360 --> 02:59:54,470
尤其是你
You, least of all.

1596
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:57,150
你责任重大
So much depends on you.

1597
02:59:58,200 --> 03:00:00,150
弗罗多？
Frodo?

1598
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:09,830
我知道你想一个人静一静
I know why you seek solitude.

1599
03:00:10,560 --> 03:00:13,950
日复一日的，我看着你默默的承受
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1600
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:17,830
你确定你不是白白受苦吗？
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1601
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:22,150
还有其他的路，弗罗多
There are other ways, Frodo.

1602
03:00:22,360 --> 03:00:26,190
-我们可以尝试别的选择  -我知道你想说什么
-Other paths that we might take.  -I know what you would say.

1603
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:30,180
看似很有道理，但我已得到警告
It would seem like wisdom, but for the warning in my heart.

1604
03:00:30,400 --> 03:00:33,470
警告？警告什么？
Warning? Against what?

1605
03:00:33,720 --> 03:00:35,830
我们都一样恐惧，弗罗多
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1606
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:39,660
但如果让恐惧恣意肆虐，毁灭一切希望
But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have,

1607
03:00:39,880 --> 03:00:43,660
-未免太荒谬了吧  -没有别的路可走
-don't you see that is madness?  -There is no other way.

1608
03:00:45,440 --> 03:00:48,750
我仅仅只想要捍卫我人民的力量！
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1609
03:00:50,360 --> 03:00:52,390
-把魔戒借我  -不行
-If you would but lend me the Ring.  -No.

1610
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:57,310
-你为何退缩，我又不是强盗  -你失去理智了
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.  -You are not yourself.

1611
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:02,430
你以为你能成功吗？
What chance do you think you have?

1612
03:01:02,640 --> 03:01:07,310
他们会找到你，他们会把魔戒抢走
They will find you. They will take the Ring.

1613
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:11,220
让你求生不得，求死不能
And you will beg for death before the end!

1614
03:01:13,360 --> 03:01:15,430
你这个傻子
You fool!

1615
03:01:15,640 --> 03:01:19,630
你只是靠运气才得到它，它应该是我的，快给我！
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine!

1616
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:22,630
它应该是我的！给我！
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1617
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:24,060
-快给我！  -不！
-Give it to me!  -No!

1618
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:26,110
-给我！  -不！
-Give it to me!  -No!

1619
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:35,790
我知道了
I see your mind.

1620
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,950
你会把魔戒给索伦！
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1621
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:41,070
你会背叛我们！
You will betray us!

1622
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:44,470
你会害我们跟你一起死！
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

1623
03:01:44,880 --> 03:01:48,550
我诅咒你！我诅咒所有的半身人！
Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings!

1624
03:01:55,600 --> 03:01:57,150
弗罗多？
Frodo?

1625
03:02:01,440 --> 03:02:03,030
弗罗多
Frodo.

1626
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:08,990
我做了什么？
What have I done?

1627
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:10,910
求求你，弗罗多
Please, Frodo.

1628
03:02:11,120 --> 03:02:13,790
弗罗多，对不起！
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1629
03:03:02,400 --> 03:03:03,790
弗罗多？
Frodo?

1630
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:08,150
-它蛊惑了波罗莫  -魔戒呢？
-It has taken Boromir.  -Where is the Ring?

1631
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:10,150
别过来！
Stay away!

1632
03:03:10,560 --> 03:03:12,150
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1633
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:18,230
-我发誓过要保护你  -你能保证不害我吗？
-I swore to protect you.  -Can you protect me from yourself?

1634
03:03:27,920 --> 03:03:30,380
你会坚持摧毁它吗？
Would you destroy it?

1635
03:03:35,400 --> 03:03:37,350
亚拉冈
Aragorn.

1636
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:43,060
亚拉冈
Aragorn.

1637
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:46,750
伊力萨王
Elessar.

1638
03:03:54,400 --> 03:03:57,790
我愿意跟随你到最后
I would have gone with you to the end.

1639
03:03:58,440 --> 03:04:01,270
跟随你到魔多烈焰
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1640
03:04:04,640 --> 03:04:05,780
我明白了
I know.

1641
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:13,710
好好照顾他们，尤其是山姆，他不会理解的
Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand.

1642
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:19,150
快跑，弗罗多！
Go, Frodo!

1643
03:04:22,160 --> 03:04:23,670
快跑
Run.

1644
03:04:23,920 --> 03:04:25,590
快跑呀！
Run!

1645
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:51,830
弗罗多先生！
Mr. Frodo!

1646
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:02,870
去找半身人！
Find the halfling!

1647
03:05:04,520 --> 03:05:07,030
去找半身人！
Find the halfling!

1648
03:05:10,520 --> 03:05:12,190
伊兰迪尔！
Elendil!

1649
03:05:18,680 --> 03:05:20,230
阿拉贡，快走！
Aragorn, go!

1650
03:05:41,960 --> 03:05:43,270
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1651
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:45,470
躲过来，快点！
Hide here. Quick!

1652
03:05:46,080 --> 03:05:47,550
快点！
Come on!

1653
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,070
他在干嘛？
What's he doing?

1654
03:05:56,280 --> 03:05:58,270
他要离开了
He's leaving.

1655
03:06:03,080 --> 03:06:05,990
-不！  -皮平！
-No!  -Pippin!

1656
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:13,220
快跑吧，弗罗多，快跑！
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1657
03:06:13,800 --> 03:06:16,910
-嘿，你们几个！  -看这儿！
-Hey, you!  -Over here!

1658
03:06:17,280 --> 03:06:18,910
-这里！  -这边！
-Over here!  -This way!

1659
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:32,110
-成功了！  -我知道成功了，快跑！
-It's working!  -I know it's working! Run!

1660
03:07:27,440 --> 03:07:30,510
-刚铎的号角  -是波罗莫
-The horn of Gondor.  -Boromir.

1661
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:14,740
快跑！
Run!

1662
03:11:46,320 --> 03:11:47,950
不
No.

1663
03:11:51,880 --> 03:11:54,910
-他们把霍比特人抓走了  -别动
-They took the little ones.  -Hold still.

1664
03:11:55,160 --> 03:11:57,190
弗罗多，弗罗多在哪里？
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1665
03:11:59,080 --> 03:12:00,550
我让他走了
I let Frodo go.

1666
03:12:01,240 --> 03:12:03,830
你做到我做不到的事
Then you did what I could not.

1667
03:12:04,840 --> 03:12:08,150
我想要抢走魔戒
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1668
03:12:08,680 --> 03:12:12,950
-现在谁也抢不走魔戒了  -原谅我
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.  -Forgive me.

1669
03:12:13,160 --> 03:12:15,430
我没想到
I did not see it.

1670
03:12:15,640 --> 03:12:18,870
-我让大家失望了  -不，波罗莫
-I have failed you all.  -No, Boromir.

1671
03:12:19,280 --> 03:12:21,840
你英勇的战斗
You fought bravely.

1672
03:12:22,120 --> 03:12:24,790
捍卫了你的尊严
You have kept your honor.

1673
03:12:25,400 --> 03:12:27,270
算了
Leave it.

1674
03:12:27,640 --> 03:12:29,710
一切都结束了
It is over.

1675
03:12:30,920 --> 03:12:36,110
人类世界将会灭亡，黑暗将会笼罩大地
The world of Men will fall. And all will come to darkness

1676
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:39,590
我的城市也将遭到毁灭
and my city to ruin.

1677
03:12:43,640 --> 03:12:46,350
我不知道我有多大的力量
I do not know what strength is in my blood,

1678
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:50,550
但我发誓，我绝不会让白城沦陷
but I swear to you, I will not let the White City fall,

1679
03:12:51,560 --> 03:12:54,070
也不会让我们的人民受苦
nor our people fail.

1680
03:12:55,040 --> 03:12:56,390
我们的人民
Our people.

1681
03:13:00,240 --> 03:13:02,310
我们的人民
Our people.

1682
03:13:24,080 --> 03:13:27,070
我愿跟随你，我的好兄弟
I would have followed you, my brother.

1683
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:30,630
我的领袖
My captain.

1684
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:35,190
我的国王
My king.

1685
03:13:54,840 --> 03:13:57,070
安息吧
Be at peace,

1686
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:59,470
刚铎之子
son of Gondor.

1687
03:14:15,920 --> 03:14:19,270
他们会盼望他重回白塔
They will look for his coming from the White Tower.

1688
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:22,750
但是他却永远也回不去了
But he will not return.

1689
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:47,990
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1690
03:15:07,440 --> 03:15:10,750
我真希望魔戒没在我手中
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1691
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,990
我真希望这一切都没发生
I wish none of this had happened.

1692
03:15:17,960 --> 03:15:20,710
每个人遇到难关都会这么想
So do all who live to see such times,

1693
03:15:20,920 --> 03:15:24,390
但我们无法决定自己的命运
but that is not for them to decide.

1694
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:27,190
你所能决定的只是
All you have to decide

1695
03:15:27,440 --> 03:15:32,190
在这段时间内该如何去做
is what to do with the time that is given to you.

1696
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,070
不，弗罗多！
Frodo, no!

1697
03:16:03,640 --> 03:16:04,910
弗罗多！
Frodo!

1698
03:16:05,720 --> 03:16:08,390
-弗罗多先生！  -不了，山姆
-Mr. Frodo!  -No, Sam.

1699
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:13,870
回去吧，山姆！
Go back, Sam!

1700
03:16:14,400 --> 03:16:17,940
-我要一个人去魔多  -没问题
-I'm going to Mordor alone.  -Of course you are.

1701
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:21,030
但我要跟你一起去！
And I'm coming with you!

1702
03:16:21,520 --> 03:16:23,950
你不会游泳！
You can't swim!

1703
03:16:27,720 --> 03:16:29,430
山姆！
Sam!

1704
03:16:35,040 --> 03:16:36,350
山姆！
Sam!

1705
03:17:17,280 --> 03:17:19,990
我许下一个承诺，弗罗多先生
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1706
03:17:20,320 --> 03:17:24,670
"永远别离开他，山姆卫斯·甘吉"
A promise "don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1707
03:17:25,800 --> 03:17:28,430
而我绝不离开你
And I don't mean to.

1708
03:17:28,680 --> 03:17:30,830
绝对不会
I don't mean to.

1709
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:34,350
山姆
Sam.

1710
03:17:49,240 --> 03:17:50,910
来吧
Come on.

1711
03:18:19,360 --> 03:18:23,870
快，弗罗多和山姆到东岸了
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.

1712
03:18:38,800 --> 03:18:43,790
-你不打算跟去  -我们帮不了弗罗多
-You mean not to follow them.  -Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1713
03:18:47,200 --> 03:18:52,060
我们一切的努力都白费了，远征队也彻底失败
Then it has all been in vain. The Fellowship has failed.

1714
03:19:03,920 --> 03:19:07,110
我们的努力不会白费
Not if we hold true to each other.

1715
03:19:08,480 --> 03:19:12,950
我们不能丢下梅里和皮平让他们受苦
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.

1716
03:19:13,960 --> 03:19:19,190
只要我们还有一丝力气。不用的都留下来
Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind.

1717
03:19:20,480 --> 03:19:22,470
轻装上阵
We travel light.

1718
03:19:22,720 --> 03:19:24,630
让我们去猎杀半兽人吧
Let us hunt some Orc.

1719
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:29,630
好！
Yes!

1720
03:19:48,600 --> 03:19:50,070
魔多
Mordor.

1721
03:19:50,680 --> 03:19:54,070
希望其他人走的路比较安全
I hope the others find a safer road.

1722
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:57,560
神行客会照顾他们的
Strider will look after them.

1723
03:19:58,480 --> 03:20:01,870
我想我们不会再见到他们了
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1724
03:20:02,200 --> 03:20:04,630
弗罗多，我们也许还会再见
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1725
03:20:04,840 --> 03:20:06,390
也许会
We may.

1726
03:20:08,440 --> 03:20:09,550
山姆
Sam,

1727
03:20:13,120 --> 03:20:15,750
真高兴有你陪着我
I'm glad you are with me.
