1
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,661
这世界改变了
FEMALE VOICE:The world is changed.

2
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,873
我从水中感觉到
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,543
我从地上感觉到
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,131
我从空气中嗅到
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,425
过去的一切
Much that once was...

6
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,177
都已失落
...is lost.

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,930
现在没有人记得了
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:08,930
魔戒首部曲


9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,198
这一切都从铸造魔戒开始
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.

10
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,325
精灵族得到三只戒指
Three were given to the Elves:

11
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,287
他们能够长生不老也是最有智慧、最公平的种族
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

12
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,415
矮人族分到七只戒指
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

13
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,587
他们很会挖掘矿坑是山洞的巧心工匠
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,297
而人类…
And nine...

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,509
则分到九只戒指
...nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...

16
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,554
他们比别人更贪图权力
...who, above all else, desire power.

17
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:43,894
每只戒指都拥有统治每个种族的力量
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.

18
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,565
但他们都受到欺骗
But they were all of them deceived.

19
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,901
因为还有一只被铸造了
For another ring was made.

20
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:55,322
在魔多末日火山的烈焰中
In the land of Mordor,in the fires of Mount Doom...

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,202
黑暗魔君索伦暗中铸造了可以奴役世界的…
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...

22
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,454
至尊魔戒
...to control all others.

23
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,625
他在魔戒中注入他的邪恶、残酷
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice...

24
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,046
以及统治天下的可怕欲望
...and his will to dominate all life.

25
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,884
一只驾驭一切的至尊魔戒
One Ring to rule them all.

26
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,387
一个接一个
One by one...

27
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:23,267
中土世界的自由之土感受到至尊魔戒的力量
...the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.

28
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,520
但是有些人群起反抗
But there were some who resisted.

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,650
组成了精灵和人类的最后同盟对抗魔多的邪恶兵团
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,488
他们在险恶的末日火山为中土世界的自由奋战
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for Middle-earth's freedom.

31
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,438
胜利终于在望
Victory was near.

32
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,944
但是至尊魔戒的力量
But the power of the Ring...

33
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,197
无人能敌
...could not be undone.

34
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,723
就在这时候
It was in this moment...

35
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,309
当大家都失去希望之际
...when all hope had faded...

36
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,647
人皇之子埃西铎拾起他父亲的宝剑
...that Isildur, son of the king,took up his father's sword.

37
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,226
黑暗魔君索伦，中土世界自由之民之敌终于被击败
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.

38
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,277
至尊魔戒落入埃西铎手中
The Ring passed to Isildur...

39
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,698
他只有一次机会永远摧毁邪恶
...who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

40
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,534
但是人心…
But the hearts of Men...

41
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,245
很容易受到蛊惑
...are easily corrupted.

42
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,125
而且魔戒有它自己的意欲
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.

43
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,637
它背叛了埃西铎最后害死了他
It betrayed Isildur to his death.

44
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,685
不该被遗忘的东西
And some things that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,229
也遗失了
...were lost.

46
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,274
历史成为传说
History became legend...

47
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,484
传说成为神话
...legend became myth.

48
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,571
两千五百年来
And for 2500 years...

49
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,450
至尊魔戒的下落无人得知
...the Ring passed out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,911
命运巧妙的安排
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,707
让它蛊惑一个新的持有者
...it ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:39,921
我的宝贝
GOLLUM:My precious.

53
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,716
至尊魔戒落入咕鲁手中
The Ring came to the creature Gollum...

54
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,803
他把它带到迷雾山脉的洞穴中
...who took it deep into the Misty Mountains.

55
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,973
他的身心完全被魔戒占据
And there it consumed him.

56
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,225
终于来了
GOLLUM:It came to me.

57
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,855
这是我的，我的爱，是我的
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,777
我的宝贝
My precious.

59
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,825
它让咕鲁得到违反自然的长寿
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,871
五百年来它扭曲他的心智
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,667
它在咕鲁阴暗的洞穴中静静地等待
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,it waited.

62
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,129
黑暗再度笼罩大地
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,216
在东方谣言四起
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

64
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,219
人们心中产生无比的恐惧
...whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,722
于是至尊魔戒知道
And the Ring of Power perceived...

66
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,725
它即将再度现身
...its time had now come.

67
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,814
它舍弃了咕鲁
It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,985
但是出乎至尊魔戒的意料之外
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.

69
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,408
它被一个料想不到的人捡到
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.

70
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,659
这是什么？
What's this?

71
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,327
一个哈比人
A Hobbit.

72
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,247
夏尔的比尔博巴金斯
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

73
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,207
一只戒指
A ring.

74
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,292
不见了！
Lost!

75
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,507
我最珍贵的东西不见了！
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,009
不久的将来…
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:13,432
哈比人将决定世界的命运
...when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:26,375
魔戒现身

79
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:33,173
夏尔…60年后

80
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,458
眼前道路无止尽
Down from the door where it began

81
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,091
蜿蜒歧岖又漫长
And I must follow if I can

82
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:53,221
虽然路程尚遥远
The road goes ever on and on

83
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,892
眼前道路无止尽
Down from the door where it began

84
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:02,063
虽然路程尚遥远
Now far ahead the road has gone

85
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,485
-但我一定要继续前进-你迟到了
- And I must follow if I can - You're late.

86
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,575
巫师绝对不会迟到佛罗多巴金斯
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

87
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,997
也不会早到他一定准时照他想的时间到
Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

88
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,428
见到你真好，甘道夫
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

89
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,019
我才不会错过比尔博的生日
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

90
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,315
外界怎么样？告诉我一切
What news of the world?Tell me everything.

91
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,319
一切？你这哈比人未免太好奇了
Everything? You're far too eager and curious for a Hobbit.

92
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,946
太不正常了
Most unnatural.

93
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,950
我该怎么说？
What can I tell you?

94
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,538
这世界就如往常一样继续着
Life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past Age.

95
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,374
人来人往、熙熙攘攘
Full of its own comings and goings.

96
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,460
完全无视于哈比族的存在
Scarcely aware of the existence of Hobbits.

97
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,713
真是谢天谢地
For which I am very thankful.

98
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,679
是甘道夫
It's Gandalf!

99
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,902
期待已久的生日宴会
Oh, the long-expected party.

100
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,871
生日快乐比尔博巴金斯

101
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,702
那老不死还好吧？
How is the old rascal?

102
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,330
听说生日宴会非常盛大
I hear it'll be a party of special magnificence.

103
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,500
你也知道比尔博他把这儿搞得鸡飞狗跳
You know Bilbo.He's got the place in an uproar.

104
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,419
这样他应该高兴了
That should please him.

105
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,005
-夏尔有一半的人被邀请-那样也好
- Half the Shire's invited.- Gracious me.

106
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,342
他好像在搞什么名堂好吧，你不说拉倒
He's up to something.All right, then. Keep your secrets.

107
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,846
在你出现前巴金斯家族声誉一向都很好
Before you came along,Bagginses were well thought of.

108
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,265
我们从不冒险或犯规
Never had any adventures.

109
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,730
如果你指的是那只恶龙那件事与我无关
If you're referring to the dragon incident, I was barely involved.

110
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,525
我只是推了你叔叔一把
All I did was give your uncle a nudge out of the door.

111
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,821
不管怎样你都正式被列为捣乱份子
Well, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.

112
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,073
真的吗？
Oh, really?

113
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,581
甘道夫！甘道夫！
Gandalf! Gandalf!

114
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,047
烟火，甘道夫
Fireworks, Gandalf!

115
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,761
-甘道夫！-烟火，甘道夫！
Gandalf! Fireworks, Gandalf!

116
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,405
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

117
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,077
-你回来了我好高兴-我也是，好孩子
- I'm glad you're back.- So am I, dear boy.

118
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,999
我也是
So am I.

119
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,394
哇　哇
Whoa, whoa.

120
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,457
和宴会无关者不准进入

121
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,282
不要，多谢了
No, thank you!

122
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,412
我不欢迎访客、祝寿者或远亲
We don't want any visitors,well-wishers or relations!

123
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,124
如果是一个老朋友呢？
And what about very old friends?

124
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,003
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

125
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,133
-比尔博巴金斯-亲爱的甘道夫
- Bilbo Baggins.- My dear Gandalf!

126
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:03,471
见到你真好111岁大寿，谁会相信？
Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it?

127
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,225
你一点都没老
You haven't aged a day.

128
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,859
进来吧！
Come on, come in!

129
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,445
欢迎
Welcome, welcome.

130
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,157
来吧
Oh, here we are.

131
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,286
喝杯茶？或是小酌两杯？
Tea? Or maybe something stronger?

132
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,248
我还有几瓶1296年的陈年好酒
I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

133
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,502
很好的年份，几乎跟我一样老
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

134
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:40,175
我爸珍藏的，开一瓶如何？
It was laid down by my father.What say we open one, eh?

135
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,011
我喝茶就好，谢谢
Just tea, thank you.

136
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,679
哦
Oh.

137
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,060
你上礼拜就该到了
I expected you last week.

138
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,564
你一向都想来就来、说走就走
But you come and go as you please.You always have.

139
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:00,028
只是我有点措手不及家里只有冻鸡和腌黄瓜
I'm a bit unprepared. We've only got cold chicken and pickle...

140
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,573
还有乳酪，不行，太寒酸了
There's some cheese here.No, that won't do.

141
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,702
我有覆盆子果酱、苹果馅饼
We've got raspberry jam,an apple tart...

142
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,373
但不会有剩下的了哦，不，我们没问题
But not much for afters.Oh, no, we're all right.

143
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,276
我找到一些海绵蛋糕
I've just found some sponge cake.

144
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,794
孤山

145
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,631
我可以煮几个蛋--
I could make eggs...

146
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,758
哦，甘...
Oh, Gandalf?

147
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,137
-茶就行了，谢谢-好吧
- Just tea, thank you.- Oh, right.

148
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,557
-介意我先吃吗？-你尽管吃吧
- Mind if I eat? - No, not at all.

149
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,100
比尔博巴金斯


150
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,519
比尔博！比尔博！比尔博！
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

151
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,312
说我不在家
I'm not at home!

152
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,066
我被这些烦人的亲戚
I must get away from these confounded relatives...

153
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,193
吵得一刻不得安宁
...never giving me any peace.

154
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,947
我好想再看到高耸的山脉
I want to see mountains again.Mountains, Gandalf!

155
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,701
然后找一个安静的地方写书啊，茶滚了
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

156
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,831
-你真的要实现你的计划？-对，一切都在计划中
- You mean to go through with your plan? - Yes. It's all in hand.

157
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,250
我全都安排好了
All the arrangements are made.

158
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,920
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

159
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,464
佛罗多起了疑心
Frodo suspects something.

160
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,092
当然了他是巴金斯家的人
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

161
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,928
不是硬瓶的笨小孩
...not some blockhead from Hardbottle.

162
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,265
你会告诉他吧？
You will tell him, won't you?

163
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,184
-会啦-他很喜欢你
- Yes, yes.- He's very fond of you.

164
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,938
我知道
I know.

165
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,652
我开口的话他一定会跟我去
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

166
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,698
但他还是衷心深爱夏尔的家园
In his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire.

167
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,618
绿油油的树林和草地
The woods, the fields.

168
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,121
潺潺的溪流
Little rivers.

169
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,295
我老了，甘道夫
I am old, Gandalf.

170
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,926
虽然我看起来并不老但是我的心老了
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.

171
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,639
我的意志变得很薄弱
I feel thin.

172
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,516
一切都索然无味
Sort of stretched...

173
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,146
就像面包上的奶油涂得不够多
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

174
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,817
我需要一个很长的假期
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

175
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,237
我并不打算回来
And I don't expect I shall return.

176
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,659
我打定主意不回来
In fact, I mean not to.

177
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,416
老托比种的，南区最好的烟草
Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

178
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,849
额
Ah.

179
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,353
甘道夫老友…
Gandalf, my old friend...

180
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,356
这将是令人难忘的一晚
...this will be a night to remember.

181
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,254
你好
Hello, hello.

182
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,550
小胖博哲，很高兴见到你，欢迎
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.Welcome, welcome.

183
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,137
山姆，快去邀萝丝跳舞
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

184
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,310
-我想再喝一杯啤酒-不行啦
- I'll just have another ale.- No, you don't.

185
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,146
去呀
Go on!

186
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,117
我站在那儿
So there I was...

187
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,413
面对三个可怕的食人妖
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

188
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,581
它们吵着…
And they were all arguing...

189
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,167
要怎么把我们煮来吃
...about how to cook us.

190
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,423
是一口就把我们给吞了或是一个接着一个把我们压扁
Whether it be turned on a spit or if they should squash us into jelly.

191
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,969
他们喋喋不休吵个没完没了
They spent so much time arguing whithertos and whyfors...

192
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,764
结果天亮的第一道曙光
...that the sun's first light crept over the trees...

193
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,268
把它们都变成石头
...and turned them all to stone!

194
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,941
快点
Quickly.

195
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,945
哇
Whoa!

196
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,156
上去了
Up they go!

197
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,243
最大的那个啦
No, the big one.

198
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,464
-快跑-你要把它插在地上
- Done! - It should be in the ground.

199
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,175
-插好了呀-要插在外面啦
- It is in the ground. - Outside!

200
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,026
比尔博
Bilbo!

201
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,155
当心那只飞龙
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

202
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,742
这儿有一千年没出现飞龙了
There hasn't been a dragon here for 1000 years.

203
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,842
-棒呆了-再来一次
- That was good. - Let's get another one.

204
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,681
梅里亚达克烈酒鹿皮瑞格林图克
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

205
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,725
我就知道
I might've known.

206
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,691
致词，比尔博
Speech, Bilbo!

207
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,860
致词！
Speech!

208
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,154
致词！
Speech!

209
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,702
亲爱的巴金斯家和波芬家
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

210
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,705
图克家和烈酒鹿家
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

211
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,375
葛卢伯家、丘伯家
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

212
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,626
吹号者家
...Hornblowers...

213
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,462
博哲家
...Bolgers...

214
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,381
抱腹家
...Bracegirdles...

215
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,217
-和傲脚家-是傲足啦！
...and Proudfoots. - Proudfeet!

216
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,556
今天是我111岁生日
Today is my 111th birthday!

217
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,892
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

218
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:09,397
但是111年的时光太短了
But alas, 111 years is far too short a time to live among...

219
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,483
我真想多跟你们在一起
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

220
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,154
我只认识你们一丁点
I don't know half of you as well as I'd like...

221
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,950
而你们一丁点也不值得我喜欢
...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.

222
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,414
我...
I, uh...

223
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,296
我要做一件事
I have things to do.

224
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,804
这件事我拖了太久
I've put this off far too long.

225
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,604
很遗憾我要宣布宴会结束了
I regret to announce this is the end!

226
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,939
我要走了
I'm going now.

227
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,943
我要向大家道别
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

228
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,530
再见了
Goodbye.

229
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,900
你一定觉得这招很高明
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

230
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,487
你没看到他们的表情吗？甘道夫
Come on, Gandalf.Did you see their faces?

231
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:44,700
世上有很多神奇戒指但是不该随便乱用
There are many magic rings in this world. None should be used lightly.

232
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,078
我只是开个玩笑
It was just a bit of fun.

233
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,998
不过就像平时一样，你说的对
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

234
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,920
-你会照顾佛罗多吧？-当然会
- You will keep an eye on Frodo?- Two eyes.

235
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,798
我会尽全力照顾他
As often as I can spare them.

236
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,176
-我要把一切都留给他-那只戒指呢？
- I'm leaving him everything.- What about the ring?

237
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,721
-那要留下来吗？-当然了
- Is that staying too?- Yes, yes.

238
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:10,226
我用信封装好放在壁炉上面
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

239
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,272
不对，等一下…
No. Wait, it's...

240
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,485
它在我的口袋
...here in my pocket.

241
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,326
真奇怪，不是吗？
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

242
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,498
是呀，有何不可呢？
Yet, after all, why not?

243
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:38,921
-我何不留着它？-你应该把戒指留下来
- Why shouldn't I keep it?- You should leave the ring behind.

244
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,549
有这么困难吗？
Is that so hard?

245
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,050
没有呀
Well, no.

246
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,971
当然有
And yes.

247
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,018
现在我突然不想把它给别人
Now it comes,I don't feel like parting with it.

248
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,978
它是我的，是它找到我的
It's mine. It came to me!

249
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:58,399
-你也没必要动肝火吧-这全是你的错
- There's no need to get angry.- Lf I'm angry, it's your fault!

250
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,651
它是我的
It's mine.

251
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,405
我一个人的
My own.

252
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,743
-我的宝贝-宝贝？
- My precious.- Precious?

253
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,787
以前也有别人这么叫过它
It's been called that before,but not by you.

254
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,582
这是我的戒指，与你无关
What business is it of yours what I do?

255
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,543
那只戒指你留着够久了
I think you've had that ring long enough.

256
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,588
-你只想独吞它-比尔博巴金斯
- You want it for yourself!- Bilbo Baggins!

257
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:25,051
别把我当成一个江湖术士
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

258
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,929
我并不想抢你的东西
I am not trying to rob you.

259
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,644
我只想帮助你
I'm trying to help you.

260
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,448
我们都认识这么久了
All your long years,we've been friends.

261
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,992
请你像以前一样相信我
Trust me as you once did.

262
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,704
放手吧
Let it go.

263
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,249
你说得对
You're right, Gandalf.

264
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,046
戒指一定要留给佛罗多
The ring must go to Frodo.

265
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,342
天色晚了，路还很长
It's late. The road is long.

266
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,053
是时候了
Yes, it is time.

267
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,891
比尔博　哦？
- Bilbo.- Hm?

268
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,852
戒指还在你的口袋
The ring is still in your pocket.

269
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,148
是的
Yes.

270
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,598
我替我的书想到一个结尾
I've thought up an ending for my book:

271
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:01,272
“他从此快乐地生活下去直到他寿终正寝”
"And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."

272
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,859
你一定会的，老友
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

273
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,361
再见了，甘道夫
Goodbye, Gandalf.

274
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,741
再见了，比尔博
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

275
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,795
眼前道路无止尽…
The road goes ever on and on

276
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,758
后会有期了
Until our next meeting.

277
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,748
它是我的，我一个人的
It's mine. My own.

278
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,376
我的宝贝
My precious.

279
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,421
黑暗中的谜语
Riddles in the dark.

280
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,008
比尔博！
Bilbo! Bilbo!

281
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,515
我的宝贝
My precious.

282
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,352
宝贝
Precious.

283
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,063
他走了，对吧？
He's gone, hasn't he?

284
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,902
他一直都说要离开这儿
He talked for so long about leaving...

285
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,821
没想到他真的走了
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

286
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,495
甘道夫
Gandalf?

287
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,129
比尔博的戒指
Bilbo's ring.

288
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,840
他去和精灵住在一起
He's gone to stay with the Elves.
s

289
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,135
他把袋底洞留给你了
He's left you Bag End.

290
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,308
还有他所有的财产
Along with all his possessions.

291
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,395
戒指是你的了
The ring is yours now.

292
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,484
-把它藏起来-你要去哪儿？
- Put it somewhere out of sight.- Where are you going?

293
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,945
-我一定要去办些事-什么事？
- I must see to things.- What things?

294
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:17,408
-我有一些疑问一定要得到解答-你才刚到
- Questions that need answering.- You've only just arrived.

295
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,911
我不明白
I don't understand.

296
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,249
我也不明白
Neither do I.

297
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,629
要保密
Keep it secret.

298
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,798
把它藏起来
Keep it safe.

299
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,960
夏尔！
Shire!

300
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,380
巴金斯！
Baggins!

301
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,848
第二纪元的3434年
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

302
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:09,436
以下是埃西铎的记载刚铎之王…
Here follows the account of Isildur,High King of Gondor...

303
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,315
以及找到至尊魔戒的过程
...and the finding of the Ring of Power."

304
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,654
我终于拿到手了
"It has come to me.

305
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,324
这只至尊魔戒将是我的镇国之宝
The One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

306
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,953
我的后代将永远对它效忠
All those in my line shall be bound to its fate...

307
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,957
我绝不容许魔戒受到任何损伤
...for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.

308
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,668
这是我的宝贝
It is precious to me...

309
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,171
我经过多少痛苦才得到它
...though I buy it with great pain.

310
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,512
戒环的刻痕逐渐褪色
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

311
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,559
那些赤焰般的文字现在全部消失
The writing, which was as clear as flame, has all but disappeared.

312
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,813
只有火焰能让秘密显现
A secret now that only fire can tell."

313
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,332
夏尔
Shire.

314
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,501
巴金斯
Baggins.

315
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:19,047
巴金斯家族都住在哈比屯
There's no Bagginses here.They're all up in Hobbiton.

316
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,259
在那边
That way.

317
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,685
-晚安-晚安
- Good night.- Good night.

318
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,772
晚安，山姆
Good night, Sam.

319
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,383
你有守密吗？它安全吗？
Is it secret? Is it safe?

320
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,682
额
Ah.

321
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,394
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

322
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,576
把手伸出来
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

323
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,911
很冰凉
It's quite cool.

324
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,208
你看到什么？
What can you see?

325
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,379
你能看到什么吗？
Can you see anything?

326
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,466
什么也没有
Nothing.

327
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,135
什么也没有
There's nothing.

328
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,721
等等
Wait.

329
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,061
上面有刻痕
There are markings.

330
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,941
好像是精灵文，我看不懂
It's some form of Elvish.I can't read it.

331
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,735
很少人看得懂
There are few who can.

332
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,116
这是魔多的古文字我现在不可以念出来
The language is that of Mordor,which I will not utter here.

333
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,826
魔多！
Mordor!

334
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,078
它说的是
In the common tongue, it says:

335
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,790
至尊戒，驭众戒
"One Ring to rule them all...

336
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,334
至尊戒，寻众戒
...One Ring to find them...

337
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,753
魔戒至尊引众戒
...One Ring to bring them all...

338
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,048
禁锢众戒黑暗中
...and in the darkness bind them."

339
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,719
这只至尊魔戒
This is the One Ring...

340
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:34,182
是黑暗魔君索伦以末日火山的烈焰铸成
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.

341
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:38,437
埃西铎从索伦手中夺过来
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

342
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,773
比尔博找到它
Bilbo found it.

343
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,151
-在咕鲁的洞穴中-是的
- In Gollum's cave.- Yes.

344
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,906
比尔搏六十年来不动声色地持有至尊魔戒
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

345
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:52,492
他因此而延长了寿命延迟了老化
...prolonging his life,delaying old age.

346
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,539
但是状况已经改变了邪恶在魔多蠢蠢欲动
But no longer, Frodo.Evil is stirring in Mordor.

347
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,167
至尊魔戒被唤醒了
The Ring has awoken.

348
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,128
它听到主人的召唤
It's heard its master's call.

349
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,215
但是索伦已经被消灭了
But he was destroyed.Sauron was destroyed.

350
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,015
不，佛罗多
No, Frodo.

351
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,269
索伦的灵魂没有死
The spirit of Sauron endured.

352
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:24,816
他的生命和至尊魔戒紧紧相系至尊魔戒仍然幸存
His life force is bound to the Ring,and the Ring survived.

353
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,277
黑暗魔君索伦回来了
Sauron has returned.

354
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,280
他的半兽人大军与日俱增
His Orcs have multiplied.

355
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,534
他在魔多也重建了要塞巴拉多
His fortress at Barad-d?r is rebuilt in Mordor.

356
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:39,498
索伦只需要这只戒指就能让黑暗再度笼罩大地
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.

357
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,750
他在搜寻至尊魔戒
He is seeking it.

358
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,837
全心全意、不择手段地搜寻
Seeking it. All his thought is bent on it.

359
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,757
同时至尊魔戒也渴望
For the Ring yearns above all else...

360
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,386
回到它主人的手中
...to return to the hand of its master.

361
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,388
他们本为一体
They are one...

362
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,641
至尊魔戒和黑暗魔君
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

363
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,892
佛罗多
Frodo...

364
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,353
绝对不能让他找到至尊魔戒
...he must never find it.

365
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,562
好
All right.

366
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:07,234
把它藏起来再也不提
We put it away. We keep it hidden.We never speak of it again.

367
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,070
没人知道它在这儿，是吧？
No one knows it's here, do they?

368
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,952
是不是？甘道夫
Do they, Gandalf?

369
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,415
有一个人知道比尔博得到至尊魔戒
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.

370
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,669
我到处在找咕鲁
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

371
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,005
但是魔君先找到他
But the enemy found him first.

372
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,259
他不晓得被拷打了多久
I don't know how long they tortured him.

373
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,930
但是在可怕的哀嚎和呻吟声中他们听出两个名字：
But amidst the screams and inane babble, they discerned two words:

374
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,266
夏尔
Shire!

375
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,059
巴金斯
Baggins!

376
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,103
夏尔
Shire.

377
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,148
巴金斯他们会找到这里来
Baggins. But that wouldlead them here!

378
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,027
什么人？
Who goes there?

379
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,988
你拿去，甘道夫
Take it, Gandalf!

380
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,448
-拿去-不行
- Take it!- No.

381
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,992
-你一定要拿去-你不能把魔戒给我
- You must!- You cannot offer me this!

382
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,537
-我要把它给你-别引诱我，佛罗多
- I'm giving it to you!- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

383
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,291
我不敢拿
I dare not take it.

384
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,085
我更不能保护它
Not even to keep it safe.

385
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,213
你要了解
Understand, Frodo...

386
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,509
我只希望利用至尊魔戒行善事
...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.

387
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:25,645
但是它透过我将释放无法想像的邪恶力量
But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.

388
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,149
-它不能留在这儿-没错
- But it cannot stay in the Shire! No.

389
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,652
的确不能
No, it can't.

390
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,367
我该怎么做？
What must I do?

391
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,581
-你一定要赶快走-去哪里？
- You must leave. And leave quickly.- Where do I go?

392
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,043
离开这儿，赶到布理村
Out of the Shire. The village of Bree.

393
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,419
布理
Bree.

394
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,380
-那你呢？-我会等你
- What about you? - I'll be waiting for you...

395
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,050
在跃马旅店
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

396
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,012
-魔戒在那儿安全吗？-我不知道，佛罗多
- And the Ring will be safe there?- I don't know, Frodo.

397
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,181
我无法回答你
I don't have any answers.

398
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:08,230
我必须去见巫师长他有智慧及力量，相信我
I must see the head of my order.He's both wise and powerful. Trust me.

399
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,565
他知道该怎么做
He'll know what to do.

400
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,027
你不能用巴金斯这名字
You'll have to leave the name Baggins behind.

401
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,738
这名字在夏尔之外不安全
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

402
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,700
白天赶路，别走大道
Travel only by day. And stay off the road.

403
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,538
我可以穿过农田
I can cut across country easily enough.

404
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,375
好孩子
My dear Frodo.

405
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,711
哈比人真不可思议
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

406
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,798
只要一个月就能了解他们
You can learn all their ways in a month.

407
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,384
但一百年后
And yet, after 100 years...

408
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,594
他们仍然让你吃惊不已
...they can still surprise you.

409
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,556
趴下来
Get down.

410
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:58,280
可恶的山姆卫斯詹吉你一直在偷听吗？
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee! Were you eavesdropping?

411
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:02,951
我才没有偷听什么我只是在窗外除草而已
I haven't been dropping no eaves.I was cutting grass under the window.

412
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,579
现在除草未免太晚了
A little late for trimming the verge!

413
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,623
-我听到说话声-你听到什么？快说
- I heard voices.- What did you hear? Speak!

414
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,916
没什么啦
Nothing important.

415
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,588
我听到戒指、黑暗魔君和世界末日--
I heard about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world...

416
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:19,509
甘道夫大爷，别伤害我别把我变成死的东西
Please, Mr. Gandalf, don't hurt me.Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

417
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,845
不要？
No?

418
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,181
也许不会
Perhaps not.

419
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,852
你有更好的用处
I've thought of a better use for you.

420
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,607
快点，山姆，跟上来
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

421
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,319
你们千万要小心
Be careful, both of you.

422
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,363
敌人有很多眼线
The enemy has many spiesin his service:

423
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,533
包括飞鸟野兽
Birds, beasts.

424
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,120
安全吗？
Is it safe?

425
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,165
千万别戴上它
Never put it on...

426
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,793
黑暗魔君的爪牙会被吸引来
...for the Dark Lord's agents will be drawn to its power.

427
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,462
你要记住
Always remember...

428
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,132
至尊魔戒想要回到主人手上
...the Ring is trying to get back to its master.

429
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,635
它想要被找到
It wants to be found.

430
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,427
这就是了
This is it.

431
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,888
这是什么？
This is what?

432
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,307
我只要再跨一步
If I take one more step...

433
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,687
就是我离家最远的一次
...it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.

434
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,401
走吧，山姆
Come on, Sam.

435
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,703
我记得比尔博老是说：
Remember what Bilbo said:

436
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:14,040
-“旅行很危险--”---一旦你出了门上了路
- "It's a dangerous business..."Frodo, going out your door.

437
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:18,670
如果你不专心看路
You step onto the road,and if you don't keep your feet...

438
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,008
谁晓得你会被带到哪里去
...there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

439
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,368
末日火山再度升起烟硝
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

440
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,203
时间不多了
The hour grows late.

441
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,957
灰袍巫师甘道夫赶到艾辛格
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

442
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,585
寻求我的建议
...seeking my counsel.

443
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,797
你就是为了这件事来找我？
For that is why you have come,is it not?

444
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,257
我的老友
My old friend.

445
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,134
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

446
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,933
-你很确定吗？-千真万确
SARUMAN: You are sure of this? GANDALF: Beyond any doubt.

447
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,062
至尊魔戒被发现了？
So the Ring of Power has been found.

448
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,440
它这么多年来一直在夏尔
All these long years,it was in the Shire.

449
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,860
-就在我眼前-你却没有发现它
- Under my very nose. - Yet you did not see it.

450
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,865
哈比人的烟草让你的思维呆滞
Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.

451
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:33,787
但是还来得及还有时间对抗索伦的势力
But we still have time enoughto counter Sauron if we act quickly.

452
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,455
时间？
Time?

453
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,042
我们哪来的时间？
What time do you think we have?

454
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,338
索伦的力量几乎完全恢复
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

455
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,757
虽然他尚未完全转生
He cannot yet take physical form...

456
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,635
但他的灵魂仍有强大魔力
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

457
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:54,391
虽然他被封在要塞中但是他却无所不知
Concealed within his fortress,the Lord of Mordor sees all.

458
00:39:54,934 --> 00:40:00,897
他的视线能穿透乌云、阴影土地甚至肉体
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

459
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,527
你知道我在说什么吗？
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

460
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:11,699
一个被烈焰包围的巨大眼睛
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

461
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,452
就是索伦之眼
The Eye of Sauron.

462
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,247
他正在聚集邪恶力量
He is gathering all evil to him.

463
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:22,335
很快就能召集大军向中土世界展开攻击
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army great enough to attack Middle-earth.

464
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,046
你知道这些？
You know this?

465
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,090
怎么会？
How?

466
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,342
我亲眼看到
I have seen it.

467
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,971
真知晶石是个危险的工具
A palantir is a dangerous tool,Saruman.

468
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,181
为什么？
Why?

469
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,351
为什么要害怕使用它？
Why should we fear to use it?

470
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,983
其它的真知之石下落不明
They are not all accounted for,the lost Seeing-stones.

471
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,361
我们不知道还有谁也在看
We do not know who else may be watching.

472
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,700
时间来不及了
The hour is later than you think.

473
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,202
索伦的行动已经展开
Sauron's forces are already moving.

474
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,207
那九个已经离开米那斯魔窟
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

475
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,625
那九个？
The Nine?

476
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,879
他们在仲夏夜跨越艾辛河
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

477
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,715
伪装成黑骑士
...disguised as riders in black.

478
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,886
-他们已经到了夏尔？-他们会找到至尊魔戒
- They've reached the Shire?- They will find the Ring.

479
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,723
然后杀死它的持有者
And kill the one who carries it.

480
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,725
佛罗多
Frodo!

481
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,742
你以为哈比人能对抗索伦吗？
You did not think a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?

482
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,287
谁都无法抗拒他
There are none who can.

483
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,542
没有人能打败
Against the power of Mordor...

484
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,337
魔多的力量
...there can be no victory.

485
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,467
我们必须加入他们
We must join with him, Gandalf.

486
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,095
我们必须投靠索伦
We must join with Sauron.

487
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,434
这么做才聪明，朋友
It would be wise, my friend.

488
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,269
告诉我…
Tell me...

489
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,604
朋友
...friend...

490
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,151
智者萨鲁曼几时发疯了？
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

491
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,359
我给你机会
I gave you the chance...

492
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,154
自愿帮助我
...of aiding me willingly...

493
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:59,492
但是你却宁愿选择受苦
...but you have elected the way of pain!

494
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,309
佛罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

495
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,686
佛罗多
Frodo! Frodo!

496
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,357
-我以为我跟丢你了-你在说什么？
- I thought I'd lost you.- What are you talking about?

497
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,527
-甘道夫跟我说过-他说什么？
- It's something Gandalf said.- What did he say?

498
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:39,240
“紧跟着他，山姆卫斯詹吉”我会紧跟着你不放
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee." And I don't mean to.

499
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:43,119
我们还在夏尔，会有什么事？
Sam, we're still in the Shire.What could possibly happen?

500
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,626
-梅里，是佛罗多巴金斯-哈，佛罗多
- Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.- Hello.

501
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,210
快起来
Get off him.

502
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,212
起来，佛罗多
Come on, Frodo.

503
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,256
这算什么？
What's the meaning of this?

504
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,467
你们偷摘老农夫马嘎的菜
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

505
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,096
快给我滚
You get back here!

506
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,432
快滚，臭小子
Get out of my field!

507
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,435
你们最好小心点别让我抓到
You'd better watch out when I catch you!

508
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,605
生什么气嘛，不过两根红萝卜
I don't know why he's upset.It's only carrots.

509
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,898
还有几棵包心菜
And some cabbages.

510
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,026
和上礼拜偷的几袋马铃薯
And those bags of potatoes we lifted last week.

511
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:19,238
-还有上上礼拜偷的蘑菇-皮聘，重点是…
- And the mushrooms the week before. Yes, Pippin. My point is...

512
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,616
他太小题大作了
...he's clearly overreacting.

513
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,326
快跑
Run!

514
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,342
好险哦
Oh, that was close.

515
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,554
我好像摔断了什么
I think I've broken something.

516
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,933
烈酒鹿和图克家最会惹麻烦
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

517
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,770
什么？这是一条捷径耶
What? That was just a detour.A shortcut.

518
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,189
-去哪儿的捷径？-蘑菇
- Shortcut to what? - Mushrooms!

519
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,449
那是我的
That's mine.

520
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,829
好大一朵哦，梅里
That's nice, Merry.

521
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,415
这里也有，山姆
Here's a nice one, Sam.

522
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,126
我们最好躲起来
I think we should get off the road.

523
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,678
躲起来！
Get off the road!

524
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,388
快点
Quick!

525
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,902
别出声
Be quiet!

526
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,054
那是什么东东？
What was that?

527
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,255
你看到什么吗？
Anything?

528
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,423
没有
Nothing.

529
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,426
这是怎么回事？
What is going on?

530
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,764
黑骑士在找什么东西或是什么人
That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone.

531
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,809
佛罗多
Frodo?

532
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,353
趴下来
Get down!

533
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,454
我一定要离开夏尔
I have to leave the Shire.

534
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,791
我跟山姆要赶到布理
Sam and I must get to Bree.

535
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,418
没问题
Right.

536
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,046
巴寇伯理渡口，跟我来
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

537
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,681
快跑
Run!

538
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,893
这儿，跟上来
This way! Follow me!

539
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,522
快跑
Run!

540
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,579
快去松绳
Get the rope, Sam!

541
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,000
佛罗多
Frodo!

542
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,877
快跑，佛罗多
Run, Frodo!

543
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,337
-快-快点！
Go! Hurry!

544
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,131
快
Come on!

545
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,092
-快点-跳呀
Come on! Faster! Jump!

546
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:09,236
-最近的渡桥有多远？-烈酒桥，二十里
- How far to the nearest crossing?- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

547
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,336
来吧
Come on.

548
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,976
-你们要什么？-我们要去跃马旅店
- What do you want?- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

549
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,315
哈比人，四个哈比人
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

550
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,902
-你们来布理有什么事？-我们只是想住旅店
- What brings you to Bree? We wish to stay at the inn.

551
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,113
我们的事你别管
Our business is our own.

552
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,824
好吧，我不是故意找碴
All right, young sir.I meant no offense.

553
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,535
天黑后我就得多问一下
It's my job to ask questions after dark.

554
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,579
听说附近有怪人游荡
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

555
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,915
小心一点比较好
Can't be too careful.

556
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:26,105
小心看路，注意脚步
Out of the way!Watch where you're walking.

557
00:50:30,923 --> 00:50:32,151
跃马旅店

558
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,756
对不起
Excuse me.

559
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,675
小客人们晚安
Good evening, little masters.

560
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:59,722
如果你们想歇一晚我们有哈比人住的舒适房间
If you need accommodation, we got cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

561
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,807
大名是…？
Mister?

562
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,186
山下，我叫山下
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

563
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,981
-山下-我们是灰袍巫师甘道夫的朋友
- Underhill.- We're friends of Gandalf.

564
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:13,486
-你能告诉他我们来了吗？-甘道夫？
- Can you tell him we've arrived?- Gandalf? Gandalf.

565
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,989
喔…
Oh, yes...

566
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,325
我记得了，一个老头子
...I remember. Elderly chap.

567
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,578
长长的灰胡子，尖尖的帽子
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

568
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,789
半年没见到他了
Not seen him for six months.

569
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,880
现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

570
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,347
山姆
Sam...

571
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,390
他一定会来的
...he'll be here. He'll come.

572
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,229
让开
Get out of my way!

573
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,274
那是什么？
What's that?

574
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,985
这就是一品脱啤酒
This, my friend, is a pint.

575
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,779
有这么大杯的？
It comes in pints?

576
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:00,866
-我也要一杯-你喝了很多了
- I'm getting one.- You got a half already!

577
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:11,043
我们来了之后那个人一直看你
That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.

578
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,090
对不起
Excuse me.

579
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,886
坐在角落的那个人是谁？
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

580
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:26,433
他是一个游侠很危险，成天在荒野游荡
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

581
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:31,230
我不知道他的名字但是这儿的人都叫他神行客
I've never heard his right name,but he's known as Strider.

582
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,817
神行客
Strider.

583
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,083
巴金斯
Baggins.

584
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,088
巴金斯
Baggins.

585
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,686
巴金斯？我认识呀
PIPPIN:
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

586
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,356
他在那儿，佛罗多巴金斯
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

587
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,610
我是他的表哥
He's my cousin,once removed on his mother's side...

588
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,029
而且是远房…
...and twice removed...

589
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,327
-皮聘-稳住
- Pippin!  Steady on.

590
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,317
你躲不了的
You cannot hide.

591
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,406
我看得见你
I see you.

592
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,827
在虚空中…
There is no life...

593
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,205
没有生命
...in the void.

594
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,873
只有…
Only...

595
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,292
死亡
...death.

596
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:26,178
你太惹人注意了，山下大爷
You draw far too much attention to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

597
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,103
-你要什么？-小心点，你戴的不是小玩意
- What do you want?- More caution. That's no trinket.

598
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,523
-我什么也没戴-才怪
- I carry nothing.- Indeed.

599
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,359
如果我想，我也能不被看到
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

600
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,238
但是完全隐形却不是件易事
...but to disappear entirely,that is a rare gift.

601
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,366
-你是什么人？-你害怕吗？
- Who are you? - Are you frightened?

602
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,618
害怕
Yes.

603
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,706
恐怕还不够，我知道谁在找你
Not nearly frightened enough.I know what hunts you.

604
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,254
放开他，否则我让你好看长腿人
Let him go!Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

605
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:06,051
小哈比人，你很有胆量但是这救不了你
You have a stout heart, Hobbit.But that will not save you.

606
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,179
你不能再等巫师了
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

607
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,431
他们来了
They're coming.

608
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,139
他们是什么东西？
What are they?

609
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,435
他们曾经是人类
They were once Men.

610
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,854
人类伟大的国王
Great kings of Men.

611
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:44,191
但是索伦给他们九只魔戒
Then Sauron gave to them nine rings of power.

612
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,945
他们利欲薰心毫不怀疑地收下
Blinded by greed,they took them without question.

613
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,490
结果都沉沦于黑暗力量
One by one, falling into darkness.

614
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,159
成为黑暗魔君的奴隶
Now they are slaves to his will.

615
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,247
他们是戒灵
They are the Nazg?l.

616
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,166
介于生与死之间
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

617
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,377
他们随时感受到…
At all times they feel...

618
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,504
魔戒的存在…
...the presence of the Ring...

619
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:10,217
被至尊魔戒吸引着他们会一直追杀你
...drawn to the power of the One.They will never stop hunting you.

620
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,147
-你带我们去哪儿？-荒野
- Where are you taking us?- Into the Wild.

621
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:30,362
你怎么知道他是甘道夫的朋友？
How do we know this Strideris a friend of Gandalf?

622
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,824
没办法，只能相信他
We have no choice but to trust him.

623
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,411
-他要带我们去哪里？-瑞文戴尔，詹吉大爷
- Where is he leading us? To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

624
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,873
-精灵的家-你们听到吗？瑞文戴尔
- To the house of Elrond. Did you hear? Rivendell.

625
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,209
我们要去见精灵
We're going to see the Elves.

626
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:06,482
-天黑才能歇脚-那早餐怎么办呢？
- We do not stop till nightfall.- What about breakfast?

627
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,401
-你们吃过了-才吃过一顿
- You had it.- We've had one, yes.

628
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,778
那第二顿呢？
What about second breakfast?

629
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,368
他不知道有第二顿早餐
Don't think he knows about second breakfast.

630
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:23,790
早午餐呢？午餐？下午茶？晚餐？宵夜？
What about elevenses? Luncheon?Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

631
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,170
-他应该都知道吧？-我看不见得
- He knows about them, doesn't he?- I wouldn't count on it.

632
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,260
皮聘
Pippin!

633
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:42,643
艾辛格听您的命令
The power of Isengard is at your command...

634
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:47,272
黑暗魔君索伦
...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

635
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:56,406
替我召集一支魔多大军
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

636
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:06,458
主人，魔多有什么命令？魔眼有什么吩咐？
What orders from Mordor, my lord?What does the Eye command?

637
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,835
我们有很多事要做
We have work to do.

638
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:56,174
这些树非常坚韧，树根很深
The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep.

639
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,385
把它们全都拉倒
Rip them all down.

640
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,707
这是风云顶了望台
This was the great watchtower of Amon S?l.

641
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,045
今晚在这里过夜
We shall rest here tonight.

642
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:48,185
这些给你们，一定要随身佩带
These are for you.Keep them close.

643
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,896
我到处看一下
I'm going to have a look around.

644
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,150
别乱跑
Stay here.

645
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,905
我的蕃茄熟了
My tomato's burst.

646
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,990
我要培根
Could I have some bacon?

647
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,159
吃蕃茄吧？
Want a tomato?

648
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:08,246
-你们在干嘛？！-煎蕃茄、香肠和培根
- What are you doing?!- Tomatoes, sausages, crispy bacon.

649
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:11,083
-我替你留了一些-笨蛋，快把火熄掉
We saved some for you. Put it out, fools!

650
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:15,170
这下可好了，蕃茄都是灰烬
That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

651
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,472
快走
Go!

652
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,402
退后，恶魔
Back, you devils!

653
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,111
佛罗多
Frodo!

654
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,117
佛罗多　哦，山姆
- Frodo.- Oh, Sam.

655
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,114
神行客
Strider!

656
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:37,372
-快救救他-他被魔窟剑刺中
- Help him, Strider.- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

657
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:43,795
我救不了他，精灵才有办法
This is beyond my skill to heal.He needs Elvish medicine.

658
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,384
快点
Hurry!

659
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:53,555
还有六天行程，他撑不下去
We're six days from Rivendell!He'll never make it!

660
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,640
你要撑下去
Hold on, Frodo.

661
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,058
甘道夫
Gandalf!

662
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:32,338
佛罗多？他好冰冷
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

663
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,968
他会死吗？
Is he going to die?

664
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:42,057
他正在进入幽界很快也会成为死灵
He's passing into the Shadow World.He'll become a Wraith like them.

665
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,982
-他们就在附近-山姆，你知道阿夕拉斯草吗？
- They're close.- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

666
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,650
-阿夕拉斯？-又叫王之剑
- Athelas?- Kingsfoil.

667
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:53,902
那是一种草药
It's a weed.

668
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,280
它能阻缓毒性发作，快去
It may help slow the poisoning.Hurry!

669
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:15,840
怎么了？游侠竟然毫无防备？
What's this?A Ranger caught off his guard?

670
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,699
佛罗多
Frodo.

671
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,704
我是亚文，我来帮助你


672
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,217
听到我的声音

673
01:08:51,522 --> 01:08:53,615
就回到光亮

674
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,468
她是谁？
Who is she?

675
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,887
佛罗多
Frodo.

676
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,431
-她是一个精灵-他快死了
- She's an Elf.- He's fading.

677
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:11,062
他撑不久的
He's not going to last.

678
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,940
一定要带他去找我父亲
We must get him to my father.

679
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,569
-我找了你两天-你要带他去哪儿？
- I've been looking for you.- Where are you going?

680
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:23,867
五名戒灵在跟着你我不知道另外四个在哪里
There are five Wraiths behind you.I don't know where the other four are.

681
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:27,287
陪着哈比人--我会来接你们


682
01:09:27,725 --> 01:09:29,352
我带他去，我骑得比较快

683
01:09:30,294 --> 01:09:31,534
路上太危险了

684
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:32,917
他们在说什么？
What are they saying?

685
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,128
如果我能渡河


686
01:09:35,566 --> 01:09:38,160
我族人的力量就可以保护他

687
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,633
我不怕他们
I do not fear them.

688
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,936
亚文…
Arwen...

689
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,315
拼命骑，别回头
...ride hard. Don't look back.

690
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:04,699
你在干嘛？！戒灵还在追杀他
What are you doing?!Those Wraiths are still out there!

691
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,768
飞奔吧　阿斯法洛斯
Noro lim, Asfaloth!

692
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,814
飞奔吧　阿斯法洛斯
Noro lim, Asfaloth!

693
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:02,066
把哈比人交给我，女精灵
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

694
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,570
如果你要他，尽管来呀
If you want him, come and claim him.

695
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:21,252
迷雾山脉的流水啊，聆听此圣言　涨起河水，向戒灵进攻！
Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen, dan in Ulair!

696
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,959
不…


697
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,507
佛罗多，别死
Frodo, no.

698
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,009
佛罗多，别放弃
Frodo, don't give in.

699
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,220
现在不行
Not now.

700
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,650
请赐给我力量…
What grace is given me...

701
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,152
让他度过灾厄
...let it pass to him.

702
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,530
让他免于死亡
Let him be spared.

703
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,199
救他
Save him.

704
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,788
聆听我的呼唤，回到光明世界
Lasto beth n?n.Tolo dan na ngalad.

705
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:50,800
-我在哪里？-你在爱隆王的皇宫
- Where am I?- You're in the house of Elrond.

706
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:57,723
现在是10月24日早上10点
It's 10:00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.

707
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:03,438
-甘道夫-是，我在这儿
- Gandalf! - Yes, I'm here.

708
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,192
你没有死算你幸运
And you're lucky to be here too.

709
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,864
再过几小时你就没救了
A few more hours and you'd have been beyond our aid.

710
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:17,201
但是你的生命力真强
But you have some strength in you,my dear Hobbit.

711
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:27,336
发生什么事？
What happened, Gandalf?

712
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:33,676
-你怎么没去找我们？-对不起，佛罗多
- Why didn't you meet us?- I am sorry, Frodo.

713
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,141
我有事耽搁了
I was delayed.

714
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:45,229
你不能随便和我绝交
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.

715
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:53,946
别再抗拒了，没有用的
One ill turn deserves another.It is over.

716
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,991
你不投靠魔戒…
Embrace the power of the Ring...

717
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,119
就等着灭亡吧
...or embrace your own destruction!

718
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:06,292
世上只有一个魔戒之王
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

719
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:10,505
只有他能够驾驭魔戒
Only one who can bend it to his will.

720
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:15,301
他不会和你分享权力
And he does not share power.

721
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,985
所以你选择了死亡
So you have chosen death.

722
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,874
甘道夫，怎么了？
Gandalf? What is it?

723
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,627
没事
Nothing, Frodo.

724
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,213
佛罗多
Frodo!

725
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:53,631
佛罗多
Frodo!

726
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,967
-山姆-你终于醒了
- Sam.- Bless you, you're awake!

727
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,928
山姆一直守在你身边
Sam has hardly left your side.

728
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,305
我们好担心你，对吧？甘道夫
We were that worried about you.

729
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:06,811
幸好有爱隆王，你开始痊愈了
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.

730
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:11,899
欢迎光临瑞文戴尔，佛罗多巴金斯
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

731
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:03,284
-比尔博-佛罗多，好孩子
Bilbo!- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

732
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,994
比尔博
Bilbo.

733
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,917
「去而复返：
"There and Back Again:

734
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,920
哈比人的故事比尔博巴金斯着
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

735
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:21,552
-太棒了-我想再回去
- This is wonderful.- I meant to go back...

736
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:25,681
我很想再去幽暗密林一趟
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

737
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,434
探访长湖镇
...visit Lake-town...

738
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,063
再看一眼孤山
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

739
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:37,401
但是我终于年老力衰了
But age, it seems,has finally caught up with me.

740
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,247
夏尔

741
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:51,290
我好想家
I miss the Shire.

742
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:56,879
我从小就幻想我能到别的地方
I spent all my childhood pretendingI was off somewhere else.

743
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,758
跟你一起去冒险
Off with you,on one of your adventures.

744
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,306
但是我自己的冒险却完全不同
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.

745
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,731
我跟你不一样，比尔博
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

746
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,151
乖孩子
My dear boy.

747
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:27,243
-我还忘了什么？-这么快就打包？
Now, what have I forgot?- Packed already?

748
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,829
越早准备越好
No harm in being prepared.

749
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,623
-但你想看精灵-是啊
- But you wanted to see the Elves.- I do.

750
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,668
-你想看得不得了-是的
- More than anything.- I did.

751
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,795
只是…
It's just...

752
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:41,173
我们照甘道夫说的做了不是吗？
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

753
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:45,052
我们把魔戒带到瑞文戴尔我觉得…
We got the Ring this far,to Rivendell. And I thought...

754
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,556
你的伤快好了，我们也要走了
...seeing as how you're on the mend,we'd be off soon.

755
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,474
回家了
Off home.

756
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,647
你说得对，山姆
You're right, Sam.

757
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:01,569
我们达成了任务
We did what we set out to do.

758
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,697
至尊魔戒在这儿很安全
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

759
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,162
我可以回家了
I am ready to go home.

760
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,998
他的力气恢复了
His strength returns.

761
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:19,879
但他的伤永远无法痊愈一辈子都会跟着他
That wound will never fully heal.He will carry it the rest of his life.

762
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,007
这一路上…
To have come so far bearing the Ring...

763
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:26,886
他证明了他能抗拒魔戒的诱惑
...he's shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.

764
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:30,473
他不该扛下这份重担
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

765
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:36,103
-佛罗多已经尽力了-敌人正在蠢蠢欲动，甘道夫
- We can ask no more of Frodo.- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

766
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:40,983
索伦的大军在东方集结他的邪眼正在盯着瑞文戴尔
Sauron's forces are massing in the East. He's fixed on Rivendell.

767
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,944
你说萨鲁曼也背叛了我们
Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

768
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:47,364
我们的盟友越来越少
Our list of allies grows thin.

769
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,910
他的恶行不只如此
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

770
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,747
他把半兽人和妖精混在一起
Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

771
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:57,416
在艾辛格的洞窟培育一支军队


772
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:02,296
一支能在白天出没的劲旅
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.

773
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,882
萨鲁曼要来抢夺至尊魔戒
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

774
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,386
精灵无法抵抗这股邪恶力量
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.

775
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:13,974
我们对抗不了魔多和艾辛格！
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

776
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:18,896
甘道夫
Gandalf...

777
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,775
至尊魔戒不能留在这儿
...the Ring cannot stay here.

778
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:45,548
这危机是整个中土世界的事
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

779
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,467
他们必须决定如何结束它
They must decide now how to end it.

780
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:53,097
精灵要卸下重担，迁移到别处
The time of the Elves is over.My people are leaving.

781
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:57,351
我们走了你们要向谁求救？矮人族吗？
Who will you look to when we've gone?The Dwarves?

782
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:02,648
他们都躲在山洞挖宝藏一点都不关心别人的问题
They seek riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.

783
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,111
我们要把希望放在人类身上
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

784
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:09,154
人类
Men?

785
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,284
人类太脆弱了他们没有希望了
Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.

786
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:17,872
登丹人的血液不再纯正他们的骄傲和荣耀早被遗忘
The blood of Numenor is spent,its pride and dignity forgotten.

787
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:21,709
魔戒会幸存，都是人类的关系
It is because of Men the Ring survives.

788
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,544
当时我也在场
I was there, Gandalf.

789
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,047
三千年前…
I was there 3000 years ago...

790
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,307
埃西铎取走至尊魔戒
...when Isildur took the Ring.

791
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:40,352
人类受到诱惑那天我也在场
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.

792
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,482
埃西铎，跟我来
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

793
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,696
我带埃西铎来到末日火山
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

794
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,491
只有在那里才能摧毁至尊魔戒
...where the Ring was forged and could be destroyed.

795
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,244
把它丢进烈焰中
Cast it into the fire!

796
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:06,211
-毁了它-不
- Destroy it!- No.

797
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,715
埃西铎
Isildur!

798
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:14,887
那天就该结束一切但是邪恶却让它存活下去
It should have ended that day,but evil was allowed to endure.

799
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:23,270
埃西铎把至尊魔戒占为己有皇室血脉就此断绝
Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken.

800
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,858
人类早已失去力量
There's no strength left in the world of Men.

801
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:32,863
-他们群龙无首四处流窜-还有一个人能让他们团结
- They're divided, leaderless.- There's one who can unite them.

802
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,408
还有一个人能继承刚铎王位
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

803
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,914
但他早就放弃王位了
He turned from that path a long time ago.

804
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,249
他选择自我放逐
He has chosen exile.

805
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:20,035
纳希尔圣剑的碎片
The shards of Narsil.

806
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,002
这把利刃砍断索伦的手指
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.

807
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,132
它还是很锐利
It's still sharp.

808
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:45,102
但现在它只是残缺的宝物
But no more than a broken heirloom.

809
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,965
你为什么害怕过去？
Why do you fear the past?

810
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:21,221
虽然你是埃西铎的后代但你并不是他
You are Isildur's heir,not Isildur himself.

811
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,850
你不会重蹈他的覆辙
You are not bound to his fate.

812
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:29,354
我跟他流着一样的血
The same blood flows in my veins.

813
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,943
一样的软弱
The same weakness.

814
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:40,449
你的荣耀即将来临
Your time will come.

815
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:45,079
你会面对同样的邪恶然后打败它
You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it.

816
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:51,832
邪恶的力量并没有征服我们


817
01:24:51,882 --> 01:24:55,443
至少你我还没被征服

818
01:25:06,863 --> 01:25:10,026
你记得我们第一次见面吗？

819
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:18,063
我好像走进了一个梦境

820
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:21,177
过了这么多年

821
01:25:22,913 --> 01:25:26,212
你不再像当初一样年少轻狂

822
01:25:27,751 --> 01:25:29,719
你还记得我当初说什么吗？

823
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,298
你说你愿意嫁给我
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

824
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:45,305
放弃精灵长生不死的力量
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

825
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,392
我仍愿意这么做
And to that I hold.

826
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,187
我宁愿和你共度一生
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

827
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:56,233
也不愿意面对永生不死的孤寂
...than face all the Ages of this world alone.

828
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:08,495
我选择成为凡人
I choose a mortal life.

829
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:14,084
-你不能给我这个-这是我的选择
- You cannot give me this.- It is mine to give to whom I will...

830
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,840
像是我的心
...like my heart.

831
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:39,276
来自远方的陌生人和老朋友
Strangers from distant lands,friends of old...

832
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:43,447
你们要商量如何对抗魔多
...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.

833
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:48,952
中土世界正面临灭亡的命运无人能幸免
Middle-earth is on the brink of destruction. None can escape it.

834
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:52,706
你们不团结一心就会遭到毁灭
You will unite, or you will fall.

835
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:57,169
每一个种族都无法幸免
Each race is bound to this fate,this one doom.

836
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,549
佛罗多，把魔戒拿来
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

837
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,315
这果然是真的
So it is true.

838
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:35,916
-人类将灭亡-这是一个礼物
The doom of Man.- It is a gift.

839
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:39,211
一个给魔多敌人的礼物
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

840
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,256
何不利用这只魔戒？
Why not use this Ring?

841
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,509
我父亲是刚铎的宰相
Long has my father,the Steward of Gondor...

842
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:49,846
他一直奋力和魔多抗争我们流着鲜血…
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.By the blood of our people...

843
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:52,266
保护你们的安全
...are your lands kept safe.

844
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:58,397
把敌人的武器交给刚铎让我们利用它来对抗邪恶
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.Let us use it against him.

845
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:02,359
你无法驾驭它，谁都不能
You cannot wield it.None of us can.

846
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:07,030
至尊魔戒的主人是索伦它没有第二个主人
The Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.

847
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,784
区区一个游侠懂什么？
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?

848
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,078
他不只是游侠
This is no mere Ranger.

849
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:17,708
他是亚拉冈，亚拉松之子
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

850
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:21,128
你要对他效忠
You owe him your allegiance.

851
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:27,134
亚拉冈
Aragorn.

852
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,722
你是埃西铎的后代
This is Isildur's heir?

853
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,810
也是刚铎的王位继承人
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

854
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,272
坐下来，勒苟拉斯


855
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:46,528
刚铎没有国王
Gondor has no king.

856
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,115
刚铎也不需要国王
Gondor needs no king.

857
01:28:56,789 --> 01:29:00,459
亚拉冈说得对，不能利用魔戒
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

858
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:04,963
你们只有一个选择
You have only one choice.

859
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,507
一定要摧毁至尊魔戒
The Ring must be destroyed.

860
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,349
那还等什么？
What are we waiting for?

861
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:30,489
金雳，葛罗音之子在场的任何武器…
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,son of Gloin...

862
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:34,910
都无法摧毁魔戒
...by any craft that we here possess.

863
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:39,581
魔戒是末日火山的烈焰铸成
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

864
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:43,627
也只有在那儿才能摧毁它
Only there can it be unmade.

865
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,297
一定要深入魔多
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

866
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:52,469
把魔戒丢到末日火山的烈焰中
...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.

867
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:53,762
p e o...Ash Nazg……

868
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:56,473
你们其中一个
One of you...

869
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:59,142
必须去做
...must do this.

870
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,774
我们不能就这样闯进魔多
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

871
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:10,320
除了有半兽人看守黑色大门
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.

872
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:15,283
还有永不松懈的邪恶力量
There is evil there that does not sleep.

873
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:19,746
索伦的邪眼更是虎视耽耽
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

874
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,541
那是一片死寂的荒原
It is a barren wasteland...

875
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:26,336
布满烈焰、灰烬和尘埃
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

876
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:30,382
光是空中就充满致命毒气
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

877
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:34,886
就算有千军万马也办不到这真荒唐
Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly.

878
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,098
你没听到爱隆王说的话吗？
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?

879
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:42,352
-一定要摧毁魔戒-你觉得你可以办到！
- The Ring must be destroyed.- And you think you can do it!

880
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:47,232
如果失败了魔戒被索伦抢回去怎么办？
And if we fail, what happens when Sauron takes back what is his?

881
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:52,696
我绝不容许魔戒落入精灵手中
I'll be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!

882
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:57,200
精灵都不可靠
Never trust an Elf!

883
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:04,207
你不明白吗？大家越吵索伦的力量就越来越强
Do you not understand?While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

884
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,419
每个人都会遭到毁灭
None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed!

885
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:30,597
我愿意
I will take it.

886
01:31:30,647 --> 01:31:33,138
我愿意去

887
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,828
我愿意把魔戒带到魔多
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

888
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,171
虽然…
Though...

889
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,092
我不认得路
...I do not know the way.

890
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:02,432
我愿意协助你，佛罗多巴金斯
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

891
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:06,019
只要你愿背负重担
...as long as it is yours to bear.

892
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:10,190
我愿意牺牲性命保护你的安危
If by my life or death I can protect you...

893
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,275
我愿意
...I will.

894
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,822
我的剑会保护你
You have my sword.

895
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:21,701
还有我的弓箭
And you have my bow.

896
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:24,788
以及我的斧头
And my ax.

897
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,798
你背负着大家的命运
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

898
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,470
如果这是大家的决定
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

899
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,390
刚铎也会支持他
...then Gondor will see it done.- Hey!

900
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:50,730
-佛罗多到哪儿我都要跟去-没错，是很难拆散你们
- He can't go without me.- It's not possible to separate you...

901
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:55,819
连你没份参加的秘密会议你都来了
...even when he's summoned to a secret Council and you're not.

902
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,321
我们也要跟去
We're coming too!

903
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:03,118
除非你把我们五花大绑送回家
You'll have to tie us up to stop us.

904
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:06,705
你需要聪明人来完成这…
You need people of intelligence on this sort of...

905
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:08,331
任务
...mission.

906
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:10,041
探索
Quest.

907
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,501
这东西
Thing.

908
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:16,089
你第一个就不合格
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

909
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:19,551
九名同伴
Nine companions.

910
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:23,179
就这样吧
So be it.

911
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:26,558
你们是魔戒远征队
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

912
01:33:27,184 --> 01:33:29,019
棒呆了
Great!

913
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,521
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

914
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:42,699
这是我的宝剑
My old sword!

915
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,659
刺针
Sting.

916
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,036
来，拿去
Here, take it.

917
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:55,420
-好轻哦-没错，精灵铸的
- It's so light.- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

918
01:33:56,088 --> 01:34:00,258
半兽人接近剑身就会发亮
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.

919
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:05,055
这样一来你就知道要格外小心
It's times like that, my lad,when you have to be extra careful.

920
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:07,724
这玩意更棒
Here's a pretty thing.

921
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,434
秘银
Mithril.

922
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:14,606
轻若鸿毛、韧如龙鳞
As light as a feather,and as hard as dragon scales.

923
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:18,068
让我看着你穿上它，快点
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

924
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:22,989
哦
Oh!

925
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:28,161
我的戒指
My old ring.

926
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:33,333
我真的很想…
I should very much like...

927
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:37,587
再把它握在手中
...to hold it again, one last time.

928
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:58,608
我很抱歉把你卷进这件事
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,my boy.

929
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:03,029
我很抱歉让你扛这重担
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

930
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:10,620
我对这一切都很抱歉
I'm sorry for everything.

931
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,781
我们向迷雾山脉以西走四十天
We hold to this course,west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

932
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:31,743
幸运的话就能赶到洛汗隘口
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will be open to us.

933
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:35,538
从那儿往东走到魔多
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

934
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:39,542
二，一，五，好！非常好
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

935
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:42,378
脚步要快
Move your feet.

936
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:43,922
-你好帅哦，皮聘-谢了
- Good, Pip.- Thanks.

937
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,548
快点
Faster!

938
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:50,720
虽然你们都不问我的意见
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,which they're not...

939
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:53,640
我还是要说我们在绕远路
...l'd say we were taking the long way.

940
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,227
我们可以穿过摩瑞亚矿坑
We could pass through the Mines of Moria.

941
01:36:57,853 --> 01:37:01,731
我表哥巴林会热烈欢迎我们
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

942
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:07,278
不行别无选择才能走摩瑞亚矿坑
No, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.

943
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:17,622
对不起
Sorry!

944
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:19,833
把他捉住
Get him!

945
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:23,753
-夏尔万岁-把他压住
For the Shire! Hold him down, Merry!

946
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:25,588
你抓住我了
You've got my arm!

947
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:28,675
-那是什么？-只是一朵乌云
- What is that? - It's just a wisp of cloud.

948
01:37:28,884 --> 01:37:31,594
它迎着风
It's moving fast.

949
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,013
很快地移动
Against the wind.

950
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,891
-登兰德的乌鸦-快躲起来
- Crebain from Dunland!- Hide!

951
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,853
-快点-躲起来
- Hurry!- Take cover!

952
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:14,971
萨鲁曼的眼线
Spies of Saruman.

953
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:19,017
南方的路受到监视
The passage south is being watched.

954
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:23,479
我们一定要攀越卡兰拉斯山
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

955
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:37,827
佛罗多！
Frodo!

956
01:38:56,805 --> 01:38:59,098
波罗莫
Boromir.

957
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:03,519
我们受尽了恐惧和疑虑的折磨
It is a strange fate we should suffer so much fear and doubt...

958
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:06,856
就为了这小玩意
...over so small a thing.

959
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:12,028
这小小的玩意
Such a little thing.

960
01:39:12,237 --> 01:39:13,696
波罗莫
Boromir!

961
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:16,991
把魔戒还给佛罗多
Give the Ring to Frodo.

962
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:28,878
遵命
As you wish.

963
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:31,631
我才不要它
I care not.

964
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:11,713
甘道夫，你想带他们攀越卡兰拉斯山
So, Gandalf, you tried to lead them over Caradhras.

965
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:16,509
要是失败，你能到哪儿？
And if that fails,where then will you go?

966
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:20,763
要是你被高山峻岭打败
If the mountain defeats you...

967
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:25,435
你肯冒更大的危险吗？
...will you risk a more dangerous road?

968
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:36,446
醒来吧，卡兰拉斯，让你的尖角沾满血污
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!Nai yarvaxea rasselya!

969
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:40,700
空中有可怕的声音
There is a fell voice on the air.

970
01:40:41,785 --> 01:40:43,286
那是萨鲁曼
It's Saruman!

971
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:56,883
他想造成山崩我们一定要回头，甘道夫
He's trying to bring down the mountain! We must turn back!

972
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:58,926
不行
No!

973
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:07,203
我们一定要离开山岭
Get off the mountain!

974
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:12,041
赶到洛汗隘口从西谷到我的城市
Make for the Gap of Rohan,and take the west road to my city!

975
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:15,586
洛汗隘口离艾辛格太近了
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

976
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:19,507
上面走不成就走下面吧
We cannot pass over a mountain.Let us go under it.

977
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:22,552
让我们穿过摩瑞亚矿坑
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

978
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:28,224
摩瑞亚？你很怕穿过矿坑
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

979
01:42:28,892 --> 01:42:33,938
矮人太贪心，挖得太深
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

980
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:39,610
你知道他们在凯撒督姆的黑暗中唤醒了：
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-d?m:

981
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:44,407
邪恶的焱魔
Shadow and flame.

982
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:50,496
让魔戒持有者决定
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

983
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,503
佛罗多？
Frodo?

984
01:43:00,549 --> 01:43:03,426
我们穿过矿坑吧
We will go through the mines.

985
01:43:04,136 --> 01:43:05,178
就这么办吧
So be it.

986
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:15,605
摩瑞亚矿坑…
The walls...

987
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:18,357
的墙
...of Moria.

988
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:30,453
让我看看
Well, let's see.

989
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,996
伊希尔丁金属
Ithildin.

990
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:36,000
它只会反射星光和月光
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

991
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:54,143
上面写着：都灵之门、摩瑞亚之主
It reads, "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

992
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:59,357
-开口说，朋友，然后进入-那是什么意思？
- Speak, friend, and enter."- What do you suppose that means?

993
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:04,320
很简单如果是朋友，说出暗语门就开了
Simple. If you're a friend, speak the password. The doors will open.

994
01:44:35,519 --> 01:44:38,062
马儿不能进入矿坑
Mines are no place for a pony.

995
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:42,358
-就算它很勇敢也不行-再见了，比尔
- Even one so brave as Bill.- Bye-bye, Bill.

996
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:46,320
去吧，比尔
Go on, Bill. Go on.

997
01:44:46,863 --> 01:44:50,408
放心，它知道路回家
Don't worry, Sam,he knows the way home.

998
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:59,792
别玩水
Do not disturb the water.

999
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:01,877
啊，没用了
Oh, it's useless.

1000
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,726
这是一个谜语
It's a riddle.

1001
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:22,606
开口说“朋友”，然后进入
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1002
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,901
朋友的精灵话怎么说？
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1003
01:45:27,362 --> 01:45:28,654
(精灵语)
"Mellon"

1004
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:51,594
你很快就会见到矮人族的热情
Soon, Master Elf, you'll enjoythe fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1005
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:57,767
熊熊的火焰、清凉的啤酒有大块的烤肉吃
Roaring fires, malt beer,ripe meat off the bone!

1006
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:02,355
这就是我表哥巴林的家
This, my friend,is my cousin Balin's home.

1007
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:05,107
就是他们所谓的矿坑
And they call it a mine.

1008
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:07,276
一个矿坑
A mine!

1009
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,655
这不是矿坑，这是坟墓
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1010
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:16,952
不
No.

1011
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,372
不！
No...

1012
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,291
不！
No!

1013
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,462
半兽人
Goblins.

1014
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:34,678
应该去洛汗隘口我们不该来这儿的
We make for the Gap of Rohan.We should never have come here.

1015
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:38,307
快走，快呀
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1016
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:43,479
-佛罗多-救我
Frodo!  -Help!

1017
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:45,314
神行客
Strider!

1018
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:48,317
-救我-在这儿
Help! Get off him!

1019
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,152
亚拉冈
Aragorn!

1020
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:00,955
佛罗多
Frodo!

1021
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:03,707
神行客
Strider!

1022
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:28,357
快进去矿坑
Into the mines!

1023
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:31,735
-勒苟拉斯-快进去
- Legolas! Into the cave!

1024
01:47:36,032 --> 01:47:37,783
快跑
Run!

1025
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:58,425
现在只有一个选择
We now have but one choice.

1026
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:03,350
我们一定要穿过黑暗的矿坑
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1027
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:05,561
大家要提高警觉
Be on your guard.

1028
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:09,231
有比半兽人更可怕的怪物
There are older and fouler things than Orcs...

1029
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,943
在这个黑暗的地底世界
...in the deep places of the world.

1030
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:24,830
安静，要走四天才能到另一边
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1031
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,876
希望我们不会惊动什么
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1032
01:48:53,276 --> 01:48:54,985
皮聘
Pippin.

1033
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,300
我不记得这地方
I have no memory of this place.

1034
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:21,804
-我们迷路了吗？-没有
Are we lost? -No.

1035
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:24,515
-应该迷路了-甘道夫正在想
I think we are. Gandalf's thinking.

1036
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:26,183
-梅里？-干嘛？
Merry? What?

1037
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:28,310
我饿了
I'm hungry.

1038
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:44,118
-下面有动静-那是咕鲁
- There's something down there.- It's Gollum.

1039
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:48,455
-咕鲁？-他跟了我们三天
- Gollum? - He's been following us for three days.

1040
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:52,835
-他从巴拉多的地牢逃出来？-逃出…
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-d?r?- Escaped...

1041
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:55,170
或是被放出来吧
...or was set loose.

1042
01:50:01,344 --> 01:50:06,515
他对魔戒又爱又恨就像他对自己爱恨交加
He hates and loves the Ring,as he hates and loves himself.

1043
01:50:06,683 --> 01:50:09,268
他永远渴望得到魔戒
He'll never be rid of his need for it.

1044
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:12,438
可惜比尔博没杀了他
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him.

1045
01:50:12,647 --> 01:50:13,856
可惜？
Pity?

1046
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:17,860
比尔博是可怜他才没杀他
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1047
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:23,949
有很多活人本来就该死也有些死人本来也命不该绝
Many that live deserve death.Some that die deserve life.

1048
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,870
你能做这种判断吗？佛罗多？
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1049
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:34,251
千万别轻易断定别人的生死
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.

1050
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:37,379
就连智者都无法决定命运
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1051
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:43,886
我直觉地认为不管是好是坏咕鲁都会跟这趟探险有关…
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill...

1052
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:47,556
在这结束前
...before this is over.

1053
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:52,895
比尔博一时心软影响了很多人
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1054
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:02,905
我真希望魔戒没在我手中
I wish the Ring had never come to me...

1055
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:06,408
真希望这一切都没发生
...and none of this had happened.

1056
01:51:06,576 --> 01:51:11,622
每个人遇到难关都会这么想但是我们无法决定自己的命运
So do all who live to see such times. That isn't for them to decide.

1057
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:17,920
我们要决定的是在一定的时间内怎么做
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that's given to us.

1058
01:51:19,422 --> 01:51:23,425
世上除了邪恶还有别的力量
There are other forces at work besides the will of evil.

1059
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:26,261
比尔博注定要找到魔戒
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1060
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:31,100
这样，你也注定要得到它
In which case,you also were meant to have it.

1061
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:34,436
能这么想就好了
And that is an encouraging thought.

1062
01:51:37,232 --> 01:51:38,607
啊
Ah!

1063
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:41,276
这个方向
It's that way.

1064
01:51:41,444 --> 01:51:43,737
-他记起来了-没有…
- He's remembered. -No...

1065
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:47,741
但是这儿的空气没那么糟
...but the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1066
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:53,163
要是迷了路跟着鼻子走就对了
If in doubt, Meriadoc,always follow your nose.

1067
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:12,141
让我冒险再弄亮一点
Let me risk a little more light.

1068
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:18,856
看吧
Behold...

1069
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:24,528
这就是宏伟的矮人故乡摩瑞亚
...the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1070
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,409
这真是令人大开眼界
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1071
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:57,227
金雳
Gimli!

1072
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:04,318
不
No.

1073
01:53:04,486 --> 01:53:06,111
不…
No!

1074
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:14,870
不
No.

1075
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:24,254
巴林长眠于此
"Here lies Balin...

1076
01:53:24,714 --> 01:53:26,715
方丁之子
...son of Fundin...

1077
01:53:27,008 --> 01:53:29,635
摩瑞亚之王
...Lord of Moria."

1078
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,387
他死了
He is dead, then.

1079
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:35,849
果然和我担心的一样
It's as I feared.

1080
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:56,995
快走吧，别在这儿逗留
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1081
01:53:57,205 --> 01:54:01,917
他们攻下桥梁和第二大厅
They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1082
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:05,587
我们闩住大门
We have barred the gates...

1083
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:08,757
却阻挡不了他们
...but cannot hold them for long.

1084
01:54:08,925 --> 01:54:11,760
大地在撼动
The ground shakes.

1085
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:13,762
鼓声
Drums...

1086
01:54:14,138 --> 01:54:17,516
地底深处传来鼓声
...drums in the deep.

1087
01:54:21,062 --> 01:54:23,105
我们逃不出去
We cannot get out.

1088
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:28,944
黑暗中有一个阴影
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1089
01:54:30,613 --> 01:54:33,198
我们逃不出去
We cannot get out.

1090
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:38,120
他们来了
They are coming."

1091
01:55:21,164 --> 01:55:22,998
你这个蠢小子
Fool of a Took!

1092
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:27,169
下次你自己也跳下去算了
Throw yourself in next time,and rid us of your stupidity.

1093
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:54,780
佛罗多
Frodo!

1094
01:55:57,075 --> 01:55:58,533
半兽人
Orcs.

1095
01:56:05,541 --> 01:56:07,542
退后，跟着甘道夫
Back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1096
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:16,593
有一只食人妖
They have a cave-troll.

1097
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:33,568
让它们来吧
Let them come!

1098
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:37,614
摩瑞亚有一个矮人还没死里
There is one Dwarf in Moria who still draws breath.

1099
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:30,852
我越来越厉害了
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1100
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:37,359
佛罗多
Frodo!

1101
01:59:10,893 --> 01:59:12,769
亚拉冈！亚拉冈！
FRODO:
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1102
01:59:13,771 --> 02:00:00,969
佛罗多
Frodo!

1103
02:00:01,019 --> 02:00:02,850
佛罗多
Frodo!

1104
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:04,214
不好了
Oh, no.

1105
02:01:12,598 --> 02:01:14,516
他还活着
He's alive.

1106
02:01:16,978 --> 02:01:19,938
我没事，我没受伤
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1107
02:01:20,147 --> 02:01:22,357
你应该没命的
You should be dead.

1108
02:01:22,566 --> 02:01:25,068
那一剑连野猪都能刺死
That would have skewered a wild boar.

1109
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:30,031
小哈比人远比我们想像的厉害
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.

1110
02:01:35,913 --> 02:01:36,955
秘银
Mithril.

1111
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:42,377
你真是叫人惊讶，巴金斯
You're full of surprises, Mr. Baggins.

1112
02:01:48,384 --> 02:01:50,302
快到凯萨督姆桥
To the Bridge of Khazad-d?m!

1113
02:02:05,276 --> 02:02:06,943
这边
This way!

1114
02:03:17,306 --> 02:03:20,308
又来了什么怪物？
What is this new devilry?

1115
02:03:36,367 --> 02:03:39,160
焱魔
A Balrog.

1116
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:42,622
远古的恶魔
A demon of the ancient world.

1117
02:03:44,834 --> 02:03:47,252
你们都不是它的对手
This foe is beyond any of you.

1118
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:50,004
快跑
Run!

1119
02:03:57,346 --> 02:03:58,847
快点！
Quickly!

1120
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:16,739
甘道夫
Gandalf.

1121
02:04:17,366 --> 02:04:18,950
带领他们，亚拉冈
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1122
02:04:20,369 --> 02:04:22,871
桥就快到了
The bridge is near.

1123
02:04:24,915 --> 02:04:29,043
听我的话快去吧，剑是无法对付焱魔的
Do as I say!Swords are no more use here.

1124
02:04:58,157 --> 02:04:59,908
甘道夫
Gandalf!

1125
02:05:18,177 --> 02:05:19,427
梅里！皮聘！
Merry! Pippin!

1126
02:05:30,523 --> 02:05:32,065
山姆！
Sam!

1127
02:05:34,777 --> 02:05:38,029
谁也不能丢矮人
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1128
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:42,492
别抓我胡子
Not the beard!

1129
02:05:55,714 --> 02:05:57,632
稳着点
Steady.

1130
02:05:59,718 --> 02:06:01,219
站好
Hold on!

1131
02:06:22,449 --> 02:06:23,658
稳住
Hang on!

1132
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:36,170
往前倾
Lean forward!

1133
02:06:39,174 --> 02:06:40,216
稳住
Steady.

1134
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:42,677
快点
Come on!

1135
02:06:42,886 --> 02:06:44,387
快跳！
Now!

1136
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:03,406
快过桥
Over the bridge!

1137
02:07:03,616 --> 02:07:05,199
快过去！
Fly!

1138
02:07:49,828 --> 02:07:51,913
你不能过来
You cannot pass!

1139
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:53,665
甘道夫
Gandalf!

1140
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:02,799
我是圣火的仆人高举着亚尔诺炽焰
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,wielder of the flame of Anor.

1141
02:08:03,801 --> 02:08:07,595
邪恶之火不会帮你乌顿之火！
The dark fire will not avail you,flame of Ud?n!

1142
02:08:17,564 --> 02:08:19,524
滚回黑暗中吧
Go back to the Shadow.

1143
02:08:27,366 --> 02:08:31,828
你不能过来
You shall not pass!

1144
02:08:58,981 --> 02:09:02,859
-不！不！-甘道夫
 No! No!- Gandalf!

1145
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:12,994
你们快走吧
Fly, you fools!

1146
02:09:17,124 --> 02:09:19,292
不
No!

1147
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:27,592
亚拉冈
Aragorn!

1148
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:27,693
勒苟拉斯，把他们扶起来
Legolas, get them up.

1149
02:10:31,782 --> 02:10:33,658
让他们静一静吧
Give them a moment!for pity's sake!

1150
02:10:33,867 --> 02:10:37,495
天一黑半兽人就会蜂拥而上
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.

1151
02:10:37,704 --> 02:10:41,040
我们一定要赶到罗斯洛立安
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.

1152
02:10:41,959 --> 02:10:45,253
走吧，波罗莫、勒苟拉斯金雳，把他们扶起来
Come, Boromir. Legolas.Gimli, get them up.

1153
02:10:46,755 --> 02:10:48,965
站起来，山姆
On your feet, Sam.

1154
02:10:49,299 --> 02:10:50,800
佛罗多？
Frodo?

1155
02:10:52,845 --> 02:10:54,554
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1156
02:11:47,065 --> 02:11:49,609
跟紧了
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1157
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:54,488
听说这儿住了可怕的女巫
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.

1158
02:11:54,698 --> 02:11:57,241
她是一个精灵
An Elf-witch...

1159
02:11:57,784 --> 02:12:00,661
拥有强大力量
...of terrible power.

1160
02:12:01,204 --> 02:12:03,414
只要看她一眼
All who look upon her...

1161
02:12:03,624 --> 02:12:05,416
就会被她蛊惑
...fall under her spell.

1162
02:12:05,626 --> 02:12:06,918
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1163
02:12:09,171 --> 02:12:11,213
然后永远消失
And are never seen again.

1164
02:12:11,423 --> 02:12:15,927
你来到这里带来毁灭的消息
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.

1165
02:12:16,136 --> 02:12:19,847
你把邪恶带来，魔戒持有者
You bring great evil here,Ring-bearer.

1166
02:12:20,057 --> 02:12:21,807
佛罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

1167
02:12:27,105 --> 02:12:32,693
她可骗不了我这矮人
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1168
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:37,448
我有老鹰的锐眼、狐狸的耳朵
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1169
02:12:45,123 --> 02:12:49,710
这矮子太聒噪就算闭着眼睛也能杀他
The Dwarf breathes so loud,we could have shot him in the dark.

1170
02:12:51,463 --> 02:12:52,922
精灵哈尔达


1171
02:12:53,725 --> 02:12:55,693
我们是来寻求救援的

1172
02:12:57,262 --> 02:12:58,957
我们需要你们的保护

1173
02:12:59,012 --> 02:13:03,224
森林太危险，最好回头
Aragorn, these woods are perilous.We should go back.

1174
02:13:03,433 --> 02:13:09,355
你们闯入森林女王国度你们不能回头
You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back.

1175
02:13:11,733 --> 02:13:15,236
来吧，她在等你们
Come. She is waiting.

1176
02:14:22,304 --> 02:14:26,724
这儿只有八人但有九人从瑞文戴尔出发
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.

1177
02:14:26,975 --> 02:14:28,809
甘道夫呢？
Where is Gandalf?

1178
02:14:28,977 --> 02:14:32,897
我想跟他说话
For I much desire to speak with him.

1179
02:14:34,524 --> 02:14:37,735
他坠入黑暗深渊
He has fallen into Shadow.

1180
02:14:42,574 --> 02:14:45,659
这趟旅程险象环生
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1181
02:14:46,495 --> 02:14:49,497
你们只要一不小心就会失败
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1182
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:52,666
世界末日也会来临
...to the ruin of all.

1183
02:15:06,431 --> 02:15:11,018
只要你们团结一致就有希望
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.

1184
02:15:14,356 --> 02:15:19,026
你们的信心不能动摇快去休息吧
Do not let your hearts be troubled.Go now and rest...

1185
02:15:19,569 --> 02:15:23,114
你们有太多的哀伤和疲惫
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1186
02:15:25,575 --> 02:15:27,535
今晚你们要睡在…
Tonight, you will sleep...

1187
02:15:27,702 --> 02:15:31,080
欢迎，夏尔的佛罗多
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1188
02:15:32,374 --> 02:15:34,416
只有你见过邪眼
...one who has seen the Eye!

1189
02:15:49,182 --> 02:15:51,600
他们在为甘道夫哀悼
A lament for Gandalf.

1190
02:15:53,562 --> 02:15:55,896
他们说些什么？
What do they say about him?

1191
02:15:56,064 --> 02:16:01,235
我不忍心告诉你们我的伤痛尚未平息
I have not the heart to tell you.For me, the grief is still too near.

1192
02:16:03,905 --> 02:16:06,198
休息吧
Take some rest.

1193
02:16:06,658 --> 02:16:09,326
这里很安全
These borders are well-protected.

1194
02:16:09,536 --> 02:16:12,079
我在这里无法休息
I will find no rest here.

1195
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:17,918
我听到她的声音
I heard her voice inside my head.

1196
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:21,881
她提到我父亲和刚铎的灭亡
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1197
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:27,553
她说现在仍有一线希望
She said to me,"Even now there is hope left."

1198
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:31,765
但是我却看不到
But I cannot see it.

1199
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:35,603
我们长久以来都没有希望
It is long since we had any hope.

1200
02:16:45,822 --> 02:16:47,948
我父亲拥有高贵情操
My father is a noble man.

1201
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:50,910
但是他无法统治刚铎
But his rule is failing...

1202
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:56,665
人民也失去信心
...and our people lose faith.

1203
02:16:58,293 --> 02:17:01,629
他希望我能成功，我也希望
He looks to me to make things right,and I'd do it.

1204
02:17:01,796 --> 02:17:05,341
我想要重建刚铎的荣耀
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1205
02:17:08,428 --> 02:17:11,180
你见过吗？
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1206
02:17:11,806 --> 02:17:14,016
爱克西里昂的白塔
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1207
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:17,853
就像珍珠一般闪闪发亮
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1208
02:17:18,521 --> 02:17:22,024
塔上的旗子随风飘扬
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1209
02:17:24,903 --> 02:17:27,154
你有没有听过
Have you ever been called home...

1210
02:17:27,322 --> 02:17:30,991
银喇叭的召唤声？
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1211
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:34,870
我很久以前见过…
I have seen the White City...

1212
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,705
这白色城市
...long ago.

1213
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:42,628
有一天，我们将一起去那儿
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1214
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:46,507
到时候守卫将高喊
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1215
02:17:46,967 --> 02:17:50,302
“刚铎之主回来了”
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1216
02:18:57,495 --> 02:19:00,080
请你看着镜子
Will you look into the mirror?

1217
02:19:00,248 --> 02:19:01,790
我会看到什么？
What will I see?

1218
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:07,087
最聪明的智者也不知道
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1219
02:19:08,006 --> 02:19:09,840
因为镜子
For the mirror...

1220
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:12,593
能显现各种事情
...shows many things.

1221
02:19:15,096 --> 02:19:17,973
过去的事情
Things that were...

1222
02:19:18,183 --> 02:19:20,768
现在的事情
...things that are...

1223
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:23,479
还有一些
...and some things...

1224
02:19:27,067 --> 02:19:30,402
尚未发生的事情
...that have not yet come to pass.

1225
02:20:52,944 --> 02:20:55,779
我知道你看到什么
I know what it is you saw.

1226
02:20:58,199 --> 02:21:00,701
它一样也在我心里呈现
For it is also in my mind.

1227
02:21:02,495 --> 02:21:06,540
如果你失败就会发生这些事
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

1228
02:21:08,918 --> 02:21:13,797
魔戒远征队已经开始四分五裂
The Fellowship is breaking.It is already begun.

1229
02:21:14,424 --> 02:21:17,718
他会试图抢走魔戒
He will try to take the Ring.

1230
02:21:17,927 --> 02:21:19,928
你知道我说的是谁
You know of whom I speak.

1231
02:21:20,930 --> 02:21:25,601
他们会一个接一个被魔戒击垮
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1232
02:21:27,103 --> 02:21:29,563
你要的话
If you ask it of me...

1233
02:21:29,939 --> 02:21:33,025
我就把至尊魔戒给你
...I will give you the One Ring.

1234
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:36,236
你毫无条件的给我
You offer it to me freely.

1235
02:21:40,825 --> 02:21:44,745
我承认我很想要魔戒
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.

1236
02:21:51,127 --> 02:21:54,421
我将成为魔戒之后
In place of a Dark Lord,you would have a queen...

1237
02:21:54,881 --> 02:21:58,675
她并不黑暗，而是美丽跟曙光一样耀眼
...not dark but beautiful,and terrible as the dawn!

1238
02:21:59,302 --> 02:22:02,346
跟海洋一样高深莫测
Treacherous as the sea!

1239
02:22:02,847 --> 02:22:07,768
远比土地更加坚强
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1240
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:10,604
世人都将热爱我
All shall love me...

1241
02:22:10,813 --> 02:22:13,649
而且自暴自弃
...and despair.

1242
02:22:27,747 --> 02:22:32,084
我通过了考验
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1243
02:22:32,335 --> 02:22:34,795
我会退隐到西方
...and go into the West...

1244
02:22:35,004 --> 02:22:39,466
-继续当凯兰崔尔女王-我一个人无法摧毁它
...and remain Galadriel.- I cannot do this alone.

1245
02:22:43,096 --> 02:22:47,224
你是魔戒持有者，佛罗多持有至尊魔戒
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.To bear a Ring of Power...

1246
02:22:48,142 --> 02:22:49,643
就必须孤单一个人
...is to be alone.

1247
02:22:50,270 --> 02:22:53,689
这是你的天命
This task was appointed to you.

1248
02:22:54,190 --> 02:22:57,401
如果你办不到
And if you do not find a way...

1249
02:22:58,278 --> 02:23:00,279
也没有人可以
...no one will.

1250
02:23:00,655 --> 02:23:03,824
我知道该怎么做了
Then I know what I must do.

1251
02:23:04,492 --> 02:23:05,576
只是…
It's just...

1252
02:23:08,329 --> 02:23:11,081
我感到害怕
...l'm afraid to do it.

1253
02:23:14,544 --> 02:23:19,673
再渺小的人也能改变未来
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.

1254
02:23:25,013 --> 02:23:30,767
你知道半兽人是怎么来的吗？
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?

1255
02:23:31,018 --> 02:23:34,855
它们曾经是精灵
They were Elves once.

1256
02:23:36,065 --> 02:23:39,401
但是却被黑暗力量
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1257
02:23:39,611 --> 02:23:42,779
折磨到不成人形
...tortured and mutilated.

1258
02:23:43,114 --> 02:23:48,410
它们是被扭曲的可怕生物
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1259
02:23:48,703 --> 02:23:50,537
却在我手中
And now...

1260
02:23:51,998 --> 02:23:53,874
达到完美境界
...perfected.

1261
02:23:54,584 --> 02:23:57,753
我的强兽人战士
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1262
02:23:59,213 --> 02:24:02,049
你的主人是谁？
...whom do you serve?

1263
02:24:02,216 --> 02:24:04,718
萨鲁曼
Saruman!

1264
02:24:25,072 --> 02:24:28,992
猎杀他们找不到他们绝不罢手
Hunt them down.Do not stop until they are found.

1265
02:24:29,202 --> 02:24:32,120
你们没有痛苦也没有恐惧
You do not know pain.You do not know fear.

1266
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:35,290
你们只会杀人
You will taste Man-flesh!

1267
02:24:40,338 --> 02:24:45,926
有一个哈比人手中有宝物活捉他…
One of the halflings has something of great value. Bring them to me alive...

1268
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:48,428
要他毫发无伤
...and unspoiled.

1269
02:24:50,223 --> 02:24:51,515
杀了其他的人
Kill the others.

1270
02:25:19,419 --> 02:25:22,629
再见了，佛罗多巴金斯
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1271
02:25:22,797 --> 02:25:26,216
我给你埃兰迪尔之光
I give you the light of E?rendil...

1272
02:25:26,968 --> 02:25:29,302
我们最挚爱的星辰
...our most beloved star.

1273
02:25:41,023 --> 02:25:45,102
愿它在所有光亮熄灭时
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1274
02:25:45,152 --> 02:25:49,781
在黑暗中为你照亮光明
...when all other lights go out.

1275
02:27:28,756 --> 02:27:30,090
佛罗多
Frodo.

1276
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:33,468
亚苟那斯巨像
The Argonath.

1277
02:27:36,430 --> 02:27:40,642
我一直都想仰望过往的国王
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1278
02:27:41,394 --> 02:27:43,311
我的诅先
My kin.

1279
02:29:02,308 --> 02:29:04,517
天一黑就过湖
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1280
02:29:04,727 --> 02:29:06,971
把船藏好再用走的
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1281
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:10,808
-从北边进入魔多-是吗？
- We approach Mordor from the North.- Oh, yes?

1282
02:29:10,858 --> 02:29:15,195
只要通过爱明莫尔就行了
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil...

1283
02:29:15,363 --> 02:29:18,615
那是充满尖石的迷宫
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1284
02:29:18,824 --> 02:29:21,910
然后呢，就更精采了
And after that, it gets even better.

1285
02:29:22,328 --> 02:29:27,248
那儿有一望无际的臭沼泽地
Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.

1286
02:29:27,458 --> 02:29:28,875
我们要走这条路
That is our road.

1287
02:29:30,378 --> 02:29:33,588
休息吧，你要养精蓄锐
Take some rest and recover your strength.

1288
02:29:33,798 --> 02:29:35,548
养精蓄锐个头--
Recover my...

1289
02:29:38,552 --> 02:29:40,171
-最好马上启程-不行
- We should leave now. No.

1290
02:29:40,221 --> 02:29:45,141
半兽人在巡逻东岸一定要等到天黑再出发
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.We must wait for cover of darkness.

1291
02:29:45,351 --> 02:29:48,812
我担心的不是东岸
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1292
02:29:49,021 --> 02:29:53,024
我心中一直有一个阴影跟威胁
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.

1293
02:29:53,526 --> 02:29:57,737
有什么正在接近，我感觉得到
Something draws near.I can feel it.

1294
02:29:59,699 --> 02:30:04,661
矮人族才不必养精蓄锐别理他，小哈比人
Recover strength?Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1295
02:30:05,162 --> 02:30:06,871
佛罗多呢？
Where's Frodo?

1296
02:30:32,523 --> 02:30:34,441
我们都不该一个人乱跑
We shouldn't wander alone.

1297
02:30:35,818 --> 02:30:37,944
尤其是你
You, least of all.

1298
02:30:38,154 --> 02:30:40,613
你的责任重大
So much depends on you.

1299
02:30:41,657 --> 02:30:43,616
佛罗多？
Frodo?

1300
02:30:50,708 --> 02:30:53,293
我知道你想一个人静静
I know why you seek solitude.

1301
02:30:54,003 --> 02:30:57,422
我每天看着你受苦
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1302
02:30:58,215 --> 02:31:01,301
你确定你不是白白受苦？
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1303
02:31:02,845 --> 02:31:05,513
有其他的路，佛罗多
There are other ways, Frodo.

1304
02:31:05,723 --> 02:31:09,559
-我们可能走其他的路-我知道你想说什么
- Other paths we might take.- I know what you would say.

1305
02:31:09,769 --> 02:31:13,563
好像很有道理，但我得到警告
It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.

1306
02:31:13,773 --> 02:31:16,858
警告？什么警告？
Warning? Against what?

1307
02:31:17,068 --> 02:31:19,194
我们都很害怕
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1308
02:31:19,403 --> 02:31:23,031
但如果让恐惧摧毁一切希望
But to let that fear drive us,to destroy our hope...

1309
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:27,035
-未免太荒谬了吧？-没有别的路可走
...don't you see that is madness?- There is no other way.

1310
02:31:28,788 --> 02:31:32,165
我需要捍卫人民的力量
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1311
02:31:33,709 --> 02:31:35,752
-把魔戒借我-不行
- Lend me the Ring.- No.

1312
02:31:36,503 --> 02:31:40,673
-为何退缩？我不是强盗-你失去了理智
- Why do you recoil? I'm no thief.- You're not yourself.

1313
02:31:42,468 --> 02:31:45,804
你以为你能成功吗？
What chance do you think you have?

1314
02:31:46,013 --> 02:31:50,683
他们会找到你，把魔戒抢走
They will find you.They will take the Ring.

1315
02:31:50,893 --> 02:31:54,604
让你求生不能、求死不得
And you will beg for death before the end!

1316
02:31:56,732 --> 02:31:58,475
你这傻子
You fool!

1317
02:31:58,525 --> 02:32:03,029
你只是靠运气得到它它应该是我的，给我吧
It is not yours, save by chance!It could have been mine.

1318
02:32:03,197 --> 02:32:06,032
它应该是我的，给我吧
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1319
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:07,151
-快给我-不
- Give it to me!- No!

1320
02:32:07,201 --> 02:32:09,536
-给我-不
- Give it!- No.

1321
02:32:17,169 --> 02:32:19,212
我知道了
I see your mind.

1322
02:32:19,421 --> 02:32:22,382
你会把魔戒给索伦
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1323
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:24,467
你会背叛我们
You will betray us!

1324
02:32:24,677 --> 02:32:27,887
你会害我们跟你一起死
You'll go to your death,the death of us all!

1325
02:32:28,305 --> 02:32:31,975
我诅咒你和所有的哈比人
Curse you! Curse you and all halflings!

1326
02:32:39,024 --> 02:32:40,567
佛罗多
Frodo?

1327
02:32:44,864 --> 02:32:46,447
佛罗多
Frodo.

1328
02:32:50,369 --> 02:32:52,412
我做了什么？
What have I done?

1329
02:32:52,621 --> 02:32:54,330
求求你，佛罗多
Please, Frodo.

1330
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,208
佛罗多，对不起
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1331
02:32:57,459 --> 02:32:59,335
佛罗多
Frodo!

1332
02:33:45,299 --> 02:33:47,217
佛罗多
Frodo?

1333
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:51,554
-它蛊惑了波罗莫-魔戒呢？
- It has taken Boromir.- Where is the Ring?

1334
02:33:51,764 --> 02:33:53,556
别过来
Stay away!

1335
02:33:53,974 --> 02:33:55,558
佛罗多
Frodo!

1336
02:33:57,811 --> 02:34:01,648
-我发誓要保护你-你能保证不害我吗？
- I swore to protect you.- Can you protect me from yourself?

1337
02:34:11,325 --> 02:34:13,826
你会摧毁它吗？
Would you destroy it?

1338
02:34:18,791 --> 02:34:20,750
亚拉冈
Aragorn.

1339
02:34:23,670 --> 02:34:26,506
亚拉冈
Aragorn.

1340
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:30,176
伊力萨
Elessar.

1341
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:41,187
我愿意跟随你到最后
I would have gone with you to the end.

1342
02:34:41,855 --> 02:34:44,691
跟随你到魔多烈焰
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1343
02:34:47,528 --> 02:34:49,195
我明白了
I know.

1344
02:34:51,657 --> 02:34:57,120
好好照顾他们尤其是山姆，他不会了解
Look after the others. Especially Sam.He will not understand.

1345
02:35:00,874 --> 02:35:02,583
去吧，佛罗多
Go, Frodo!

1346
02:35:05,587 --> 02:35:07,088
快跑呀
Run.

1347
02:35:07,339 --> 02:35:09,007
快跑呀
Run!

1348
02:35:33,073 --> 02:35:35,241
佛罗多
Mr. Frodo!

1349
02:35:44,501 --> 02:35:47,371
去找哈比人
Find the halfling!

1350
02:35:47,421 --> 02:35:49,946
快去找哈比人
Find the halfling!

1351
02:35:53,427 --> 02:35:55,595
伊兰迪尔！
Elendil!

1352
02:36:02,102 --> 02:36:03,644
亚拉冈，快走
Aragorn, go!

1353
02:36:25,376 --> 02:36:26,667
佛罗多
Frodo!

1354
02:36:27,252 --> 02:36:28,878
快躲过来
Hide here. Quick!

1355
02:36:29,505 --> 02:36:30,963
来呀
Come on!

1356
02:36:33,425 --> 02:36:35,468
他在干嘛？
What's he doing?

1357
02:36:39,681 --> 02:36:41,682
他要离开了
He's leaving.

1358
02:36:45,979 --> 02:36:49,399
-不-皮聘
- No!- Pippin!

1359
02:36:54,321 --> 02:36:56,656
快跑吧，佛罗多
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1360
02:36:57,199 --> 02:37:00,326
-喂-在这儿
- Hey! Hey, you! - Over here!

1361
02:37:00,702 --> 02:37:02,328
-这里啦-这边
- Over here!- This way!

1362
02:37:13,173 --> 02:37:15,508
-成功了-我知道啦，快跑
- It's working!- I know! Run!

1363
02:38:04,892 --> 02:38:07,977
-刚铎的号角-波罗莫
- The horn of Gondor.- Boromir.

1364
02:38:32,794 --> 02:38:33,920
快跑呀
Run!

1365
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:54,745
不
No.

1366
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:01,544
-他们把小的抓走了-别动
- They took the little ones.- Hold still.

1367
02:42:01,795 --> 02:42:03,838
佛罗多在哪里？
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1368
02:42:05,716 --> 02:42:07,174
我让他走了
I let Frodo go.

1369
02:42:07,843 --> 02:42:10,469
你做到我做不到的事
Then you did what I could not.

1370
02:42:10,971 --> 02:42:14,765
我想要抢走魔戒
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1371
02:42:15,308 --> 02:42:19,562
-现在谁也抢不走魔戒了-原谅我
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.- Forgive me.

1372
02:42:19,771 --> 02:42:22,064
我没想到
I did not see it.

1373
02:42:22,274 --> 02:42:25,484
-我让大家失望了-不，波罗莫
- I have failed you all.- No, Boromir.

1374
02:42:26,236 --> 02:42:28,446
你英勇的作战
You fought bravely.

1375
02:42:28,488 --> 02:42:31,407
你维护了你的尊严
You have kept your honor.

1376
02:42:32,033 --> 02:42:33,909
算了
Leave it.

1377
02:42:34,369 --> 02:42:36,328
一切都结束了
It is over.

1378
02:42:37,539 --> 02:42:42,752
人类世界将灭亡黑暗将笼罩大地
The world of Men will fall.And all will come to darkness...

1379
02:42:43,211 --> 02:42:46,213
我们的城市将遭毁灭
...and my city to ruin.

1380
02:42:50,469 --> 02:42:53,345
我不知道我有多少力量
I don't know what strength is in my blood...

1381
02:42:53,513 --> 02:42:57,183
但我发誓绝不会让白城沦陷
...but I swear to you,I won't let the White City fall...

1382
02:42:57,684 --> 02:43:00,686
也不会让我们的人民失败
...nor our people fail.

1383
02:43:01,646 --> 02:43:08,944
我们的人民
Our people.

1384
02:43:30,216 --> 02:43:33,719
我愿跟随你，我的兄弟
I would have followed you, my brother.

1385
02:43:35,263 --> 02:43:37,264
我的领袖
My captain.

1386
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:41,811
我的国王
My king.

1387
02:44:01,456 --> 02:44:03,707
安息吧
Be at peace...

1388
02:44:04,084 --> 02:44:06,085
刚铎之子
...son of Gondor.

1389
02:44:45,208 --> 02:44:46,959
佛罗多
Frodo!

1390
02:45:06,521 --> 02:45:09,815
我真希望魔戒没在我手中
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1391
02:45:11,067 --> 02:45:14,069
真希望这一切都没发生
I wish none of this had happened.

1392
02:45:17,032 --> 02:45:19,825
每个人遇到难关都会这么想
So do all who live to see such times...

1393
02:45:19,993 --> 02:45:23,495
但我们无法决定自己的命运
...but that is not for them to decide.

1394
02:45:23,663 --> 02:45:25,949
你只能在…
All you have to decide...

1395
02:45:25,999 --> 02:45:31,253
一定的时间内决定如何去做
...is what to do with the time that is given to you.

1396
02:46:00,075 --> 02:46:02,159
不，佛罗多
Frodo, no!

1397
02:46:02,619 --> 02:46:03,911
佛罗多
Frodo!

1398
02:46:04,204 --> 02:46:07,373
-佛罗多-不，山姆
- Mr. Frodo!  - No, Sam.

1399
02:46:10,919 --> 02:46:12,878
回去吧，山姆
Go back, Sam!

1400
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:16,966
-我要一个人去魔多-没问题
- I'm going to Mordor alone.- Of course you are.

1401
02:46:17,175 --> 02:46:20,010
但我要跟你一起去
And I'm coming with you!

1402
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:22,888
你不会游泳
You can't swim!

1403
02:46:26,685 --> 02:46:35,317
山姆
Sam!

1404
02:47:16,234 --> 02:47:18,944
我许下一个承诺，佛罗多
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1405
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:23,615
这个承诺是：“千万别离开他，山姆卫斯詹吉”
A promise:"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1406
02:47:24,743 --> 02:47:27,070
我绝不离开你
And I don't mean to.

1407
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:29,788
绝对不会
I don't mean to.

1408
02:47:31,458 --> 02:47:33,292
山姆
Sam.

1409
02:47:48,183 --> 02:47:49,850
来吧
Come on.

1410
02:48:18,546 --> 02:48:22,841
快，他们就快到东岸了
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.

1411
02:48:37,941 --> 02:48:42,736
-你不打算跟去-我们帮不了佛罗多了
- You mean not to follow them.- His fate is no longer in our hands.

1412
02:48:46,157 --> 02:48:51,036
我们一切的努力都白费了远征队也彻底失败
Then it has all been in vain.The Fellowship has failed.

1413
02:49:02,882 --> 02:49:06,051
我们的努力不会白费
Not if we hold true to each other.

1414
02:49:07,595 --> 02:49:11,890
我们不能丢下梅里和皮聘让他们受苦
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.

1415
02:49:12,392 --> 02:49:18,147
只要我们还有力气把不用的留下来
Not while we have strength left.Leave all that can be spared behind.

1416
02:49:19,649 --> 02:49:21,650
尽量减轻负担
We travel light.

1417
02:49:21,860 --> 02:49:23,569
让我们猎杀半兽人吧
Let us hunt some Orc.

1418
02:49:26,781 --> 02:49:28,574
好耶
Yes!

1419
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,011
魔多
Mordor.

1420
02:49:49,637 --> 02:49:53,015
希望其他人走的路比较安全
I hope the others find a safer road.

1421
02:49:53,933 --> 02:49:56,518
神行客会照顾他们的
Strider will look after them.

1422
02:49:57,437 --> 02:50:00,814
我想我们不会再见到他们了
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1423
02:50:01,149 --> 02:50:03,226
也许还会再见
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1424
02:50:03,276 --> 02:50:05,360
也许会
We may.

1425
02:50:07,405 --> 02:50:08,488
山姆
Sam...

1426
02:50:12,076 --> 02:50:14,703
我很高兴有你陪着我
...I'm glad you're with me.
