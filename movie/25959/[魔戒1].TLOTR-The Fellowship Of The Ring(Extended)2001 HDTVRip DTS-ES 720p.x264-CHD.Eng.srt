l smell it in the eir.

5
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:52,415
Much thet once wes...

6
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:54,175
...is lost.

7
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:57,912
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:15,204
lt begen with the forging
of the Greet Rings.

9
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:17,306
Three were given to the Elves.'

lmmortel, wisest end feirest
of ell beings.

00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:24,405
Seven to the Dwerf-lords.'

12
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:29,586
Greet miners end crertsmen
of the mountein hells.

13
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:31,282
And nine...

14
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:34,515
...nine rings were girted
to the rece of Men...

15
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:38,559
...who, ebove ell else, desire power.

16
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:44,896
For within these rings wes bound
the strength end will to govern eech rece.

17
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:49,567
But they were ell of them deceived.

18
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,900
For enother ring wes mede.

19
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:56,304
ln the lend of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:56,747 --> 00:02:01,207
...the Derk Lord Seuron forged
in secret e Mester Ring...

21
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:03,444
...to control ell others.

22
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:07,613
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his melice...

23
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:12,023
...end his will to dominete ell life.

24
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:16,899
One Ring to rule them ell.

25
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,396
One by one...

26
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:24,268
...the Free Lends of Middle-eerth
fell to the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:27,501
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:32,643
A Lest Allience of Men end Elves
merched egeinst the ermies of Mordor.

29
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,480
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-eerth.

30
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:10,412
Victory wes neer.

31
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:16,956
But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,194
...could not be undone.

33
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,721
lt wes in this moment...

34
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:48,323
...when ell hope hed feded...

35
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:52,622
...thet lsildur, son of the king,
took up his fether's sword.

36
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:30,224
Seuron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-eerth, wes defeeted.

37
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,269
The Ring pessed to lsildur...

38
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:43,709
...who hed this one chence
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,542
But the heerts of Men...

40
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,242
...ere eesily corrupted.

41
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:54,117
And the Ring of Power
hes e will of its own.

42
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:21,944
It betrayed Islldur...

43
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:26,187
... to hls death.

44
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,228
And some thlngs
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,796
... were lost.

46
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,829
Hlstory became legend...

47
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,028
...legend became myth.

48
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:45,140
And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:49,006
... the Rlng passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:52,479
Untll, when chance came...

51
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,244
...lt ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:02,422
My precious.

53
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:05,218
The Rlng came to the creature
Gollum...

54
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:09,331
... who took lt deep lnto the tunnels
of the Mlsty Mountalns.

55
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:12,500
And there lt consumed hlm.

56
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:14,728
It came to me.

57
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:19,375
My own. My Iove. My own.

58
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:24,275
My precious.

59
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,354
The Rlng brought to Gollum
unnatural long llfe.

60
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:35,389
For 500 years lt polsoned hls mlnd.

61
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:40,188
And ln the gloom of Gollum's cave,
lt walted.

62
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:43,662
Darkness crept back
lnto the forests of the world.

63
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,733
Rumor grew of a shadow ln the East...

64
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:49,735
... whlspers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,239
And the Rlng of Power percelved...

66
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:56,241
...lts tlme had now come.

67
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:01,310
It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:06,479
But somethlng happened then
the Rlng dld not lntend.

69
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:11,920
It was plcked up by the most unllkely
creature lmaglnable.

70
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,187
What's this?

71
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:14,830
A Hobblt.

72
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:17,762
Bllbo Bagglns of the Shlre.

73
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,731
A ring.

74
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:21,801
Lost!

75
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:28,010
My precious is Iost!

76
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,509
For the tlme wlll soon come...

77
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:35,946
... when Hobblts wlll shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:43,784
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,191
...in the year 1 400...

00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,662
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:55,635
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,831
...the Shire...

...MiddIe-earth.

84
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:08,815
The Third Age of this worId.

85
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:24,356
There and Back Agaln.'

86
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,732
A Hobblt's Tale.

87
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:30,839
By BiIbo Baggins.

88
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,408
Now...

89
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,139
...where to begin?

90
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:42,476
Ah, yes....

91
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:48,823
''Concerning...

92
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:51,518
...Hobbits.''

93
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:56,189
Hobblts have been llvlng and farmlng
ln the four Farthlngs of the Shlre...

94
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:58,357
...for many hundreds of years...

95
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:01,504
...qulte content to lgnore
and be lgnored...

96
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:04,868
...by the world of the Blg Folk.

97
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:10,874
Mlddle-earth belng, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

98
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:14,244
...Hobblts must seem
of llttle lmportance...

99
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,444
...belng nelther renowned
as great warrlors...

100
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:22,820
...nor counted among the very wlse.

101
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:30,189
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:33,961
In fact, lt has been remarked by some...

103
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:38,574
... that Hobblts' only real passlon
ls for food.

104
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,137
A rather unfalr observatlon...

105
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,973
...as we have also developed a keen
lnterest ln the brewlng of ales...

106
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:48,145
...and the smoklng of plpe-weed.

107
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:51,451
But where our hearts truly lle...

108
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,748
...ls ln peace and qulet...

109
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:56,652
...and good, tllled earth.

110
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,991
For all Hobblts share a love
of thlngs that grow.

111
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:09,571
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem qualnt.

112
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:14,972
But today of all days,
lt ls brought home to me.'

113
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:21,518
It ls no bad thlng
to celebrate a slmple llfe.

114
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:28,886
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,630
StickIebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:36,493
Frodo!

117
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:45,832
Down from the door where lt began

118
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:54,414
And I must follow lf I can

119
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:59,514
The road goes ever on and on

120
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:03,181
Down from the door where lt began

121
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:08,363
Now far ahead the road has gone

122
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:12,798
-And I must follow lf I can
-You're Iate.

123
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,870
A wizard is never Iate, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:25,271
Nor is he earIy. He arrives
preciseIy when he means to.

125
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,718
It's wonderfuI to see you, GandaIf!

126
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:47,329
You didn't think I'd miss
your UncIe BiIbo's birthday?

127
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:51,164
How is the oId rascaI?

128
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:55,233
I hear it's going to be a party
of speciaI magnificence.

129
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,878
You know BiIbo.
He's got the whoIe pIace in an uproar.

130
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:00,014
WeII, that shouId pIease him.

131
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:02,046
HaIf the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:04,911
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,422
And so llfe ln the Shlre goes on...

134
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:14,619
... very much as lt has
thls past Age...

135
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:20,359
...full of lts own comlngs and golngs,
wlth change comlng slowly.

136
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:22,435
If lt comes at all.

137
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:27,141
For thlngs are made to endure
ln the Shlre...

138
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:30,800
...passlng from one generatlon
to the next.

139
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:36,206
There's always been a Bagglns
llvlng here under the Hlll...

140
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,748
...ln Bag End.

141
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:43,285
And there aIways wiII be.

142
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:47,426
To teII you the truth,
BiIbo's been a bit odd IateIy.

143
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:50,893
I mean, more than usuaI.

144
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,798
He's taken to Iocking himseIf
in his study.

145
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:59,567
He spends hours porlng over old maps
when he thlnks I'm not looklng.

146
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,948
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,845
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:53,483
-AII right, then. Keep your secrets.
-What?

149
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,390
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:56,687
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:59,895
Before you came aIong, we Bagginses
were very weII thought of.

152
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:00,998
Indeed.

153
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,531
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:10,008
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was bareIy invoIved.

155
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:13,806
AII I did was give your uncIe
a IittIe nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:18,111
Whatever you did, you've been officiaIIy
IabeIed a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:20,351
Oh, reaIIy?

158
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,994
GandaIf! GandaIf!

159
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,362
Fireworks, GandaIf!

160
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,067
-GandaIf!
-Fireworks, GandaIf!

161
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:00,951
GandaIf?

162
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:05,658
-I'm gIad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:11,902
So am I.

164
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,170
No, thank you!

165
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:49,308
We don't want any more visitors,
weII-wishers or distant reIations!

166
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,037
And what about very oId friends?

167
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:57,912
GandaIf?

168
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,046
-BiIbo Baggins.
-My dear GandaIf!

169
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:07,353
Good to see you. 1 1 1 years oId!
Who wouId beIieve it?

170
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:11,120
You haven't aged a day.

171
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:19,773
Come on, come in!

172
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:22,340
WeIcome, weIcome.

173
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:26,071
Oh, here we are.

174
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:30,182
Tea? Or maybe something
a IittIe stronger?

175
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:34,151
I've got a few bottIes
of the OId Winyard Ieft. 1 296.

176
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:38,416
Very good year. AImost as oId as I am.

177
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:44,053
It was Iaid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

178
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,893
Just tea, thank you.

179
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,967
I was expecting you sometime
Iast week.

180
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:58,474
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you pIease. AIways have and aIways wiII.

181
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,912
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've onIy
got coId chicken and a bit of pickIe....

182
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:07,485
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

183
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:11,590
We've got raspberry jam,
an appIe tart....

184
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:16,286
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're aII right.

185
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:19,330
I've just found some sponge cake.

186
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:23,533
I couId make you some eggs
if you'd--

187
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:30,036
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.

188
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:33,443
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-No, not at aII.

189
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,413
BiIbo! BiIbo Baggins!

190
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:38,209
I'm not at home!

191
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:46,818
It's the SackviIIe-Bagginses.

192
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,086
-I know you're in there!
-They're after the house.

193
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:52,254
They've never forgiven me
for Iiving this Iong.

194
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:55,264
I've got to get away from these confounded
reIatives, hanging on the beII aII day...

195
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:57,404
...never giving me a moment's peace.

196
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:01,632
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, GandaIf!

197
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:06,404
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

198
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,539
-So you mean to go through with your pIan?
-Yes, yes. It's aII in hand.

199
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:12,948
AII the arrangements are made.

200
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,556
Oh, thank you.

201
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,418
Frodo suspects something.

202
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:22,059
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

203
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:24,890
...not some bIockheaded BracegirdIe
from HardbottIe.

204
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:28,232
You wiII teII him, won't you?

205
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:31,127
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.

206
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:34,897
I know.

207
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:40,613
He'd probabIy come with me
if I asked him.

208
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:44,650
I think in his heart, Frodo's
stiII in Iove with the Shire.

209
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:48,552
The woods, the fieIds.

210
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:51,087
LittIe rivers.

211
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:58,224
I am oId, GandaIf.

212
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,866
I know I don't Iook it, but I'm
beginning to feeI it in my heart.

213
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,565
I feeI thin.

214
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:11,471
Sort of stretched...

215
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,078
...Iike butter scraped
over too much bread.

216
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:20,776
I need a hoIiday. A very Iong hoIiday.

217
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:24,184
And I don't expect I shaII return.

218
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:29,589
In fact, I mean not to.

219
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:36,359
OId Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

220
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,314
GandaIf, my oId friend...

221
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:59,322
...this wiII be a night to remember.

222
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,207
HeIIo, heIIo.

223
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:27,510
Fatty BoIger. LoveIy to see you.
WeIcome, weIcome.

224
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:31,080
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

225
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:37,253
-I think I'II just have another aIe.
-Oh, no, you don't.

226
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,095
Go on!

227
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:52,074
So there I was...

228
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:56,339
...at the mercy
of three monstrous troIIs.

229
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,540
And they were aII arguing
amongst themseIves...

230
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,117
...about how they were
going to cook us.

231
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:06,349
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jeIIy.

232
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:10,920
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

233
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,691
...that the sun's first Iight
crept over the top of the trees...

234
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:18,227
...and turned them aII to stone!

235
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:24,909
QuickIy.

236
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:31,107
Up they go!

237
00:21:33,987 --> 00:21:35,181
No, the big one.

238
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:47,265
Mrs. BracegirdIe, how nice to see you.
WeIcome, weIcome.

239
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:49,334
Are aII these chiIdren yours?

240
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:52,495
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

241
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:55,839
BiIbo?

242
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,306
SackviIIe-Bagginses!

243
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,571
QuickIy, hide!

244
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,654
Thank you, my boy.

245
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:16,493
You're a good Iad, Frodo.

246
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:20,598
I'm very seIfish, you know.

247
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:24,493
Yes, I am. Very seIfish.

248
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:27,068
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

249
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,673
...but it wasn't out of charity.

250
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:30,708
I think it was because...

251
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:33,209
...of aII my numerous reIations...

252
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:37,005
...you were the one Baggins
that showed reaI spirit.

253
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:39,114
BiIbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

254
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:41,013
No.

255
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:43,915
WeII, yes, but that's not the point.

256
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:47,389
The point is, Frodo...

257
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,489
...you'II be aII right.

258
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,928
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

259
00:22:58,138 --> 00:22:59,605
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!

260
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:01,331
This was your idea.

261
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,587
Watch out for the dragon!

262
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:26,162
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

263
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:43,240
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.

264
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:49,078
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

265
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:51,153
I might've known.

266
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:59,088
Speech, BiIbo!

267
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,330
Speech!

268
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,489
Speech!

269
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:10,103
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

270
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,105
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

271
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,803
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

272
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:17,039
...HornbIowers...

273
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:19,878
...BoIgers...

274
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:21,810
...BracegirdIes...

275
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:24,615
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!

276
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:29,954
Today is my 1 1 1th birthday!

277
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,322
Happy birthday!

278
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:37,798
But aIas, eIeventy-one years is
far too short a time to Iive among...

279
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:40,905
...such exceIIent
and admirabIe Hobbits.

280
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:44,571
I don't know haIf of you
haIf as weII as I shouId Iike...

281
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:49,373
...and I Iike Iess than haIf of you
haIf as weII as you deserve.

282
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,725
I have things to do.

283
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,227
I've put this off far too Iong.

284
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:18,009
I regret to announce this is the end!

285
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:20,338
I'm going now.

286
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,347
I bid you aII a very fond fareweII.

287
00:25:26,752 --> 00:25:27,946
Goodbye.

288
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:04,315
I suppose you think
that was terribIy cIever.

289
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,890
Come on, GandaIf.
Did you see their faces?

290
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:13,122
There are many magic rings in this worId,
and none of them shouId be used IightIy.

291
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:15,493
It was just a bit of fun.

292
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:19,398
Oh, you're probabIy right, as usuaI.

293
00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:24,333
-You wiII keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.

294
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:27,205
As often as I can spare them.

295
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:30,610
-I'm Ieaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?

296
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:34,149
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.

297
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:38,655
It's in an enveIope over there
on the manteIpiece.

298
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:42,694
No. Wait, it's...

299
00:26:45,197 --> 00:26:47,893
...here in my pocket.

300
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:55,738
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

301
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,901
Yet, after aII, why not?

302
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:07,350
-Why shouIdn't I keep it?
-I think you shouId Ieave the ring behind.

303
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,948
Is that so hard?

304
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:11,487
WeII, no.

305
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,383
And yes.

306
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:20,423
Now it comes to it,
I don't feeI Iike parting with it.

307
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,396
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

308
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:26,799
-There's no need to get angry.
-WeII, if I'm angry, it's your fauIt!

309
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:29,070
It's mine.

310
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,810
My own.

311
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:37,138
-My precious.
-Precious?

312
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:40,216
It's been caIIed that before,
but not by you.

313
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,012
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

314
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:45,952
I think you've had that ring
quite Iong enough.

315
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:49,025
-You want it for yourseIf!
-BiIbo Baggins!

316
00:27:49,228 --> 00:27:53,460
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

317
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:57,329
I am not trying to rob you.

318
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:04,069
I'm trying to heIp you.

319
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:15,885
AII your Iong years,
we've been friends.

320
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:18,415
Trust me as you once did.

321
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,123
Let it go.

322
00:28:23,195 --> 00:28:25,663
You're right, GandaIf.

323
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:30,462
The ring must go to Frodo.

324
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:34,773
It's Iate. The road is Iong.

325
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:37,465
Yes, it is time.

326
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:45,272
The ring is stiII in your pocket.

327
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:23,011
I've thought up an ending for my book:

328
00:29:24,657 --> 00:29:29,685
''And he Iived happiIy ever after
to the end of his days.''

329
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:33,298
And I'm sure you wiII, my dear friend.

330
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,766
Goodbye, GandaIf.

331
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,171
Goodbye, dear BiIbo.

332
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:53,213
The roed goes ever on end on

333
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:58,188
UntiI our next meeting.

334
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:29,147
lt's mine. My own.

335
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:32,779
My precious.

336
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:35,959
RiddIes in the dark.

337
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:37,628
BiIbo!

338
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,354
BiIbo!

339
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,937
My precious.

340
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,769
Precious.

341
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:52,467
He's gone, hasn't he?

342
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:58,307
He taIked for so Iong about Ieaving...

343
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:01,247
...I didn't think he'd reaIIy do it.

344
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:07,624
GandaIf?

345
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:17,563
BiIbo's ring.

346
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,269
He's gone to stay with the EIves.

347
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:23,566
He's Ieft you Bag End.

348
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,704
AIong with aII his possessions.

349
00:31:29,915 --> 00:31:32,816
The ring is yours now.

350
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:38,914
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?

351
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:41,355
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?

352
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:45,827
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've onIy just arrived.

353
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,326
I don't understand.

354
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:53,662
Neither do I.

355
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:59,241
Keep it secret.

356
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,208
Keep it safe.

357
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:38,376

There's no Bagginses around here.
They're aII up in Hobbiton.

00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,671
That way.

375
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:58,884
To heal my heart and drown my woe

There's been some strange foIk
crossing the Shire.

00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:24,779
Dwarves and others of a Iess
than savory nature.

War is brewing.

386
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:30,185
The mountains are fair teeming
with gobIins.

387
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,015
Far-off taIes and chiIdren's stories,
that's aII that is.

388
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:37,685
You're beginning to sound Iike that oId
BiIbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

389
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:40,864
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

390
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:42,465
And proud of it.

391
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:44,932
-Cheers, Gaffer.
-Cheers.

392
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:49,199
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

393
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:53,673
Keep your nose out of troubIe,
and no troubIe'II come to you.

-Good night, Iads.
-Good night.

Good night, sweet maiden

Mind who you're sweet-taIking.

397
00:36:06,658 --> 00:36:11,186
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

398
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:13,424
Does she?

399
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:17,058
-Good night, Sam.
-Good night, Mister Frodo.

400
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:44,317
Is it secret? Is it safe?

401
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:55,364
What are you doing?

402
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:10,512
HoId out your hand, Frodo.

403
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:11,881
It's quite cooI.

404
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:17,156
What can you see?

405
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,330
Can you see anything?

406
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:25,433
Nothing.

407
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:28,094
There's nothing.

408
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:30,663
Wait.

409
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:37,009
There are markings.

410
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:41,907
It's some form of EIvish.
I can't read it.

411
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,679
There are few who can.

412
00:37:45,256 --> 00:37:50,091
The Ianguage is that of Mordor,
which I wiII not utter here.

413
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:51,750
Mordor!

414
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,020
In the common tongue, it says:

415
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,758
''One Ring to ruIe them aII...

416
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:00,301
...One Ring to find them...

417
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:02,699
...One Ring to bring them aII...

418
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:06,000
...and in the darkness bind them.''

419
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:09,670
This is the One Ring...

420
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,147
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

421
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:19,380
Taken by IsiIdur
from the hand of Sauron himseIf.

422
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:22,717
BiIbo found it.

423
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,128
-In GoIIum's cave.
-Yes.

424
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,857
For 60 years, the Ring Iay quiet
in BiIbo's keeping...

425
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:33,434
...proIonging his Iife,
deIaying oId age.

426
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:38,507
But no Ionger, Frodo.
EviI is stirring in Mordor.

427
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:41,143
The Ring has awoken.

428
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:44,075
It's heard its master's caII.

429
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:48,183
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

430
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,984
No, Frodo.

431
00:38:56,927 --> 00:39:00,226
The spirit of Sauron endured.

432
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:05,767
His Iife force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

433
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:08,232
Sauron has returned.

434
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,233
His Orcs have muItipIied.

435
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:15,469
His fortress at Barad-dur
is rebuiIt in the Iand of Mordor.

436
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,447
Sauron needs onIy this Ring to cover
aII the Iands in a second darkness.

437
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,710
He is seeking it.

438
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,788
Seeking it. AII his thought
is bent on it.

439
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,721
For the Ring yearns above aII eIse...

440
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:33,363
...to return to the hand
of its master.

441
00:39:33,564 --> 00:39:35,327
They are one...

442
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,661
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

443
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:39,858
Frodo...

444
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:42,338
...he must never find it.

445
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,529
AII right.

446
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:48,174
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

447
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:51,007
No one knows it's here, do they?

448
00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:57,915
Do they, GandaIf?

449
00:39:58,956 --> 00:40:02,392
There is one other who knew
that BiIbo had the Ring.

450
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:06,620
I Iooked everywhere
for the creature GoIIum.

451
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:08,958
But the enemy found him first.

452
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,192
l don't know how long
they tortured him.

453
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,864
But emidst the endless screems end
inene bebble, they discerned two words.'

454
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:20,202
Shire!

455
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,003
Baggins!

456
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:24,044
Shire.

457
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:27,115
Baggins. But that wouId
Iead them here!

458
00:40:29,854 --> 00:40:30,980
Who goes there?

459
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:33,951
Take it, GandaIf!

460
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:35,382
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.

461
00:40:35,593 --> 00:40:37,959
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!

462
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:41,495
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!

463
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:45,263
I dare not take it.

464
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:48,037
Not even to keep it safe.

465
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,165
Understand, Frodo...

466
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:55,471
...I wouId use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

467
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:06,585
But through me, it wouId wieId a power
too great and terribIe to imagine.

468
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:10,126
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

469
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:13,588
No, it can't.

470
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:20,334
What must I do?

471
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:25,533
-You must Ieave. And Ieave quickIy.
-Where? Where do I go?

472
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:29,008
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the viIIage of Bree.

473
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,372
Bree.

474
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:33,345
-What about you?
-I'II be waiting for you...

475
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:36,019
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

476
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,951
-And the Ring wiII be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.

477
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:42,125
I don't have any answers.

478
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:49,165
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerfuI. Trust me, Frodo.

479
00:41:49,366 --> 00:41:51,493
He'II know what to do.

480
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,968
You'II have to Ieave the name
of Baggins behind you.

481
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:57,663
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

482
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,640
TraveI onIy by day.
And stay off the road.

483
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:05,475
I can cut across country
easiIy enough.

484
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,315
My dear Frodo.

485
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:12,646
Hobbits reaIIy are amazing creatures.

486
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:15,724
You can Iearn aII that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

487
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:18,326
And yet, after a hundred years...

488
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,520
...they can stiII surprise you.

489
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,496
Get down.

490
00:42:35,712 --> 00:42:39,204
Confound it aII, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

491
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:43,876
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

492
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:46,522
A IittIe Iate for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

493
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,557
-I heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!

494
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:50,852
Nothing important.

495
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:55,524
That is, I heard a good deaI about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the worId but--

496
00:42:55,699 --> 00:43:00,432
PIease, Mr. GandaIf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnaturaI.

497
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:02,765
No?

498
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:05,100
Perhaps not.

499
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,777
I've thought of a better use for you.

500
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:14,540
Come aIong, Samwise. Keep up.

501
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,247
Be carefuI, both of you.

502
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,285
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

503
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:24,459
Birds, beasts.

504
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,060
Is it safe?

505
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,098
Never put it on...

506
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,737
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
wiII be drawn to its power.

507
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:36,395
AIways remember, Frodo...

508
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:40,070
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

509
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:42,570
It wants to be found.

510
00:44:23,153 --> 00:44:25,348
This is it.

511
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:27,816
This is what?

512
00:44:28,158 --> 00:44:30,217
If I take one more step...

513
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:34,629
...it'II be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

514
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:40,325
Come on, Sam.

515
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,643
Remember what BiIbo used to say:

516
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:54,981
-''It's a dangerous business, Frodo.''
-''Golng out your door.

517
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:59,588
You step onto the road,
and lf you don't keep your feet...

518
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:03,954
... there's no knowlng where
you mlght be swept off to. ''

519
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:19,905
Sam.

520
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:24,505
Wood-eIves.

521
00:45:38,228 --> 00:45:41,789
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

522
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:44,061
To the Grey Havens.

523
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:46,692
They're Ieaving MiddIe-earth.

524
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,064
Never to return.

525
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:54,067
I don't know why...

526
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:57,177
...it makes me sad.

527
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:03,879
Everywhere I Iie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

528
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:06,350
Just shut your eyes...

529
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:09,286
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

530
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:13,395
...with a soft mattress
and a IoveIy feather piIIow.

531
00:46:22,705 --> 00:46:25,401
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

532
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:28,442
I'm never going to be abIe
to sIeep out here.

533
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,146
Me neither, Sam.

534
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:04,738
Smoke rlses
from the Mountaln of Doom.

535
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:06,742
The hour grows lete.

536
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:10,511
And Gendelf the Grey
rides to lsengerd...

537
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,154
...seeking my counsel.

538
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:17,349
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

539
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:18,824
My oId friend.

540
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:20,687
Saruman.

541
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,494
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.

542
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,603
So the Ring of Power has been found.

543
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:34,971
AII these Iong years,
it was in the Shire.

544
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:38,408
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

545
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:43,418
Your Iove of the haIfIing's Ieaf
has cIearIy sIowed your mind.

546
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,318
But we stiII have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickIy.

547
00:47:48,524 --> 00:47:49,991
Time?

548
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,588
What time do you think we have?

549
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,898
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

550
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:00,297
He cannot yet take physicaI form...

551
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:03,200
...but his spirit has Iost
none of its potency.

552
00:48:03,873 --> 00:48:08,936
ConceaIed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees aII.

553
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:15,440
His gaze pierces cIoud, shadow,
earth and fIesh.

554
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:20,081
You know of what I speak, GandaIf.

555
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:26,257
A Great Eye, IidIess,
wreathed in fIame.

556
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:28,993
The Eye of Sauron.

557
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:31,792
He is gathering aII eviI to him.

558
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:36,870
Very soon, he'II have summoned an army
great enough for an assauIt upon MiddIe-earth.

559
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,606
You know this?

560
00:48:40,143 --> 00:48:41,633
How?

561
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,872
I have seen it.

562
00:48:44,313 --> 00:48:47,510
A paIantir is a dangerous tooI,
Saruman.

563
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,707
Why?

564
00:48:50,186 --> 00:48:52,916
Why shouId we fear to use it?

565
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:59,518
They are not aII accounted for,
the Iost Seeing-stones.

566
00:48:59,695 --> 00:49:02,892
We do not know who eIse
may be watching.

567
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:08,231
The hour is Iater than you think.

568
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,770
Sauron's forces are aIready moving.

569
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:15,773
The Nine have Ieft Minas MorguI.

570
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:17,168
The Nine?

571
00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:20,406
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

572
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,279
...disguised as riders in bIack.

573
00:49:23,486 --> 00:49:27,445
-They've reached the Shire?
-They wiII find the Ring.

574
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:31,253
And kiII the one who carries it.

575
00:49:31,794 --> 00:49:33,284
Frodo!

576
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:50,278
You did not seriousIy think that a Hobbit
couId contend with the wiII of Sauron?

577
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:53,845
There are none who can.

578
00:49:56,352 --> 00:49:59,082
Against the power of Mordor...

579
00:49:59,255 --> 00:50:01,883
...there can be no victory.

580
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:07,022
We must join with him, GandaIf.

581
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,663
We must join with Sauron.

582
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,964
It wouId be wise, my friend.

583
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:17,963
TeII me...

584
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,129
...friend...

585
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:24,704
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

586
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,915
I gave you the chance...

587
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:09,719
...of aiding me wiIIingIy...

588
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:14,056
...but you have eIected
the way of pain!

589
00:51:37,353 --> 00:51:38,843
Mr. Frodo?

590
00:51:39,455 --> 00:51:41,252
Frodo? Frodo!

591
00:51:42,658 --> 00:51:45,889
-I thought I'd Iost you.
-What are you taIking about?

592
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:49,088
-It's just something GandaIf said.
-What did he say?

593
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:53,801
''Don't you Iose him, Samwise Gamgee.''
And I don't mean to.

594
00:51:54,036 --> 00:51:57,665
Sam, we're stiII in the Shire.
What couId possibIy happen?

595
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:01,665
Frodo.

596
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:04,175
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-HeIIo, Frodo.

597
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,779
Get off him.

598
00:52:06,282 --> 00:52:07,749
Come on, Frodo.

599
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,815
What's the meaning of this?

600
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,346
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

601
00:52:14,523 --> 00:52:16,650
You get back here!

602
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,991
Get out of my fieId!

603
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:21,994
You know what's gonna happen
when I catch up with you?

604
00:52:22,198 --> 00:52:25,167
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's onIy a coupIe of carrots.

605
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:26,460
And some cabbages.

606
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:29,570
And those three bags of potatoes
that we Iifted Iast week.

607
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:33,800
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...

608
00:52:34,009 --> 00:52:36,170
...he's cIearIy overreacting.

609
00:52:36,379 --> 00:52:37,869
Run!

610
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,885
Oh, that was cIose.

611
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:58,092
I think I've broken something.

612
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:01,467
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

613
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:05,300
What? That was just a detour.
A shortcut.

614
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,738
-Shortcut to what?
-Mushrooms!

615
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:18,009
That's mine.

616
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:22,383
That's nice, Merry.

617
00:53:22,925 --> 00:53:24,950
Here's a nice one, Sam.

618
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:27,687
I think we shouId get off the road.

619
00:53:36,872 --> 00:53:38,237
Get off the road!

620
00:53:38,441 --> 00:53:39,931
Quick!

621
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:54,111
Be quiet!

622
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,583
What was that?

623
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,781
Anything?

624
00:55:37,493 --> 00:55:38,983
Nothing.

625
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:41,959
What is going on?

626
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:46,331
That BIack Rider was Iooking
for something. Or someone.

627
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:50,794
Get down!

628
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,985
I have to Ieave the Shire.

629
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:13,358
Sam and I must get to Bree.

630
00:56:13,529 --> 00:56:14,962
Right.

631
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:18,595
BuckIebury Ferry. FoIIow me.

632
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:28,240
Run!

633
00:56:29,445 --> 00:56:31,436
This way! FoIIow me!

634
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,075
Run!

635
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:51,127
Get the rope, Sam!

636
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:55,293
Frodo!

637
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:57,438
Run, Frodo!

638
00:56:57,773 --> 00:56:58,865
Go!
-Hurry!

639
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,669
Frodo, come on!

640
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:04,636
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!

641
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:23,793
-How far to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miIes.

642
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,870
Come on.

643
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,518
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

644
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:00,896
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

645
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:05,027
What's more, out of the Shire by your
taIk. What business brings you to Bree?

646
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:08,599
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

647
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,302
AII right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

648
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,005
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfaII.

649
00:58:15,182 --> 00:58:18,083
There's taIk of strange foIk abroad.

650
00:58:18,252 --> 00:58:20,413
Can't be too carefuI.

651
00:58:40,107 --> 00:58:43,599
Out of the way!
Watch where you're waIking.

652
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:09,227
Excuse me.

653
00:59:10,304 --> 00:59:13,068
Good evening, IittIe masters.
What can I do for you?

654
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:19,338
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms avaiIabIe.

655
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:24,211
AIways proud to cater
to the LittIe FoIk, Mister...?

656
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:27,344
UnderhiII. My name's UnderhiII.

657
00:59:28,622 --> 00:59:31,182
-UnderhiII, yes.
-We're friends of GandaIf the Grey.

658
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:34,521
-Can you teII him we've arrived?
-GandaIf?

659
00:59:34,928 --> 00:59:36,691
GandaIf.

660
00:59:37,464 --> 00:59:39,193
Oh, yes...

661
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:41,492
...I remember. EIderIy chap.

662
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:44,770
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

663
00:59:45,138 --> 00:59:46,969
Not seen him for six months.

664
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,077
What do we do now?

665
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:03,551
Sam...

666
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:05,588
...he'II be here. He'II come.

667
01:00:08,328 --> 01:00:10,421
Get out of my way!

668
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,460
What's that?

669
01:00:14,634 --> 01:00:17,159
This, my friend, is a pint.

670
01:00:17,337 --> 01:00:18,964
It comes in pints?

671
01:00:19,339 --> 01:00:23,036
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whoIe haIf aIready!

672
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:33,250
That feIIow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

673
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,280
Excuse me.

674
01:00:40,093 --> 01:00:43,085
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

675
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:48,634
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous foIk, wandering the WiIds.

676
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:53,395
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

677
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:57,003
Strider.

678
01:01:10,056 --> 01:01:13,287
Beggins.

679
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,254
Beggins.

680
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,874
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

681
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,547
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

682
01:01:36,716 --> 01:01:39,810
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

683
01:01:39,986 --> 01:01:42,216
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

684
01:01:46,726 --> 01:01:48,523
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.

685
01:02:18,058 --> 01:02:20,526
You cannot hide.

686
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:26,591
I see you.

687
01:02:28,301 --> 01:02:30,997
There is no Iife...

688
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:33,401
...in the void.

689
01:02:33,573 --> 01:02:35,063
OnIy...

690
01:02:35,975 --> 01:02:37,465
...death.

691
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:48,352
You draw far too much attention
to yourseIf, ''Mr. UnderhiII.''

692
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:54,015
What do you want?

693
01:02:54,194 --> 01:02:56,287
A IittIe more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

694
01:02:56,696 --> 01:02:59,722
-I carry nothing.
-Indeed.

695
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,524
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

696
01:03:02,702 --> 01:03:06,433
...but to disappear entireIy,
that is a rare gift.

697
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,534
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?

698
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:11,799
Yes.

699
01:03:11,978 --> 01:03:15,914
Not nearIy frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

700
01:03:19,886 --> 01:03:22,446
Let him go!
Or I'II have you, Longshanks.

701
01:03:24,124 --> 01:03:28,254
You have a stout heart, IittIe Hobbit.
But that wiII not save you.

702
01:03:28,428 --> 01:03:31,363
You can no Ionger wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

703
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:32,623
They're coming.

704
01:04:56,214 --> 01:04:57,704
What are they?

705
01:04:59,884 --> 01:05:02,011
They were once Men.

706
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,450
Great kings of Men.

707
01:05:04,956 --> 01:05:08,084
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

708
01:05:08,693 --> 01:05:10,354
BIinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

709
01:05:12,063 --> 01:05:15,362
One by one, faIIing into darkness.

710
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:18,058
Now they are sIaves to his wiII.

711
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:22,133
They are the NazguI.

712
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,070
Ringwraiths. Neither Iiving nor dead.

713
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,277
At aII times they feeI...

714
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:29,413
...the presence of the Ring...

715
01:05:29,581 --> 01:05:34,018
...drewn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

716
01:05:44,061 --> 01:05:47,030
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the WiId.

717
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:59,266
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of GandaIf?

718
01:05:59,443 --> 01:06:02,276
I think a servant of the enemy
wouId Iook fairer...

719
01:06:02,646 --> 01:06:06,582
-...and feeI fouIer.
-He's fouI enough.

720
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:10,051
We have no choice but to trust him.

721
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,621
-But where is he Ieading us?
-To RivendeII, Master Gamgee.

722
01:06:16,026 --> 01:06:19,291
-To the house of EIrond.
-Did you hear that? RivendeII.

723
01:06:19,896 --> 01:06:22,626
We're going to see the EIves.

724
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:48,519
-GentIemen, we do not stop tiII nightfaII.
-What about breakfast?

725
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:51,422
-You've aIready had it.
-We've had one, yes.

726
01:06:51,595 --> 01:06:53,790
What about second breakfast?

727
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,363
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

728
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:05,803
What about eIevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

729
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:10,173
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-I wouIdn't count on it.

730
01:07:15,652 --> 01:07:17,279
Pippin!

731
01:07:33,803 --> 01:07:37,239
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

732
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:18,274
Who is she?

733
01:08:19,015 --> 01:08:21,575
This woman you sing of.

734
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:27,421
'Tis the Iady of Luthien.

735
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:32,756
The EIf-maiden who gave her Iove
to Beren, a mortaI.

736
01:08:34,598 --> 01:08:36,725
What happened to her?

737
01:08:38,935 --> 01:08:41,426
She died.

738
01:08:45,475 --> 01:08:47,807
Get some sIeep, Frodo.

739
01:08:58,088 --> 01:09:02,184
The power of Isengard
ls at your command...

740
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:06,795
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

741
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:15,935
Bulld me an army worthy of Mordor.

742
01:09:21,478 --> 01:09:25,938
What orders from Mordor, my Iord?
What does the Eye command?

743
01:09:26,383 --> 01:09:28,317
We have work to do.

744
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,624
The trees are strong, my Iord.
Their roots go deep.

745
01:10:15,999 --> 01:10:17,864
Rip them aII down.

746
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:48,196
This was the great watchtower
of Amon SuI.

747
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:52,527
We shaII rest here tonight.

748
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:07,638
These are for you.
Keep them cIose.

749
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:10,342
I'm going to have a Iook around.

750
01:11:12,722 --> 01:11:14,622
Stay here.

751
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,355
My tomato's burst.

752
01:11:19,562 --> 01:11:21,462
CouId I have some bacon?

753
01:11:21,664 --> 01:11:23,632
Want a tomato, Sam?

754
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,697
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

755
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:30,566
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fooIs!

756
01:11:30,774 --> 01:11:34,767
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

757
01:11:43,253 --> 01:11:44,948
Go!

758
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:39,874
Back, you deviIs!

759
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:04,587
Frodo!

760
01:14:09,332 --> 01:14:10,594
Oh, Sam.

761
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:48,594
Strider!

762
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:56,836
-HeIp him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a MorguI bIade.

763
01:14:58,314 --> 01:15:03,274
This is beyond my skiII to heaI.
He needs EIvish medicine.

764
01:15:07,857 --> 01:15:08,846
Hurry!

765
01:15:09,058 --> 01:15:13,017
We're six days from RivendeII!
He'II never make it!

766
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:15,129
HoId on, Frodo.

767
01:15:15,631 --> 01:15:17,690
GandaIf!

768
01:17:55,723 --> 01:17:58,749
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. BiIbo's troIIs.

769
01:18:00,928 --> 01:18:03,795
Mr. Frodo? He's going coId.

770
01:18:06,667 --> 01:18:08,430
Is he going to die?

771
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:13,505
He's passing into the Shadow WorId.
He'II soon become a Wraith Iike them.

772
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:22,513
-They're cIose.
-Sam, do you know the AtheIas pIant?

773
01:18:22,683 --> 01:18:24,173
-AtheIas?
-KingsfoiI.

774
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,443
KingsfoiI, aye, it's a weed.

775
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:28,816
It may heIp to sIow the poisoning.
Hurry!

776
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:47,334
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

777
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:13,188
Frodo.

778
01:19:30,117 --> 01:19:31,982
Who is she?

779
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,417
Frodo.

780
01:19:34,622 --> 01:19:38,114
-She's an EIf.
-He's fading.

781
01:19:40,394 --> 01:19:42,589
He's not going to Iast.

782
01:19:42,796 --> 01:19:45,458
We must get him to my father.

783
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:49,067
-I've been Iooking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?

784
01:19:49,269 --> 01:19:55,367
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

785
01:20:03,117 --> 01:20:04,448
What are they saying?

786
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:12,149
I do not fear them.

787
01:20:22,036 --> 01:20:23,435
Arwen...

788
01:20:23,637 --> 01:20:26,834
...ride hard. Don't Iook back.

789
01:20:31,879 --> 01:20:36,213
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are stiII out there!

790
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:33,594
Give up the haIfIing, She-EIf.

791
01:22:34,535 --> 01:22:37,095
If you want him, come and cIaim him.

792
01:23:30,991 --> 01:23:33,459
No. No!

793
01:23:36,763 --> 01:23:39,027
Frodo, no.

794
01:23:39,233 --> 01:23:41,531
Frodo, don't give in.

795
01:23:41,735 --> 01:23:43,726
Not now.

796
01:23:54,648 --> 01:23:57,139
Whet grece is given me...

797
01:23:57,818 --> 01:23:59,683
...let it pess to him.

798
01:23:59,887 --> 01:24:02,048
Let him be spered.

799
01:24:02,656 --> 01:24:04,715
Seve him.

800
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:22,302
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of EIrond.

801
01:24:22,743 --> 01:24:29,239
And it is 1 0:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

802
01:24:31,184 --> 01:24:34,950
-GandaIf!
-Yes, I'm here.

803
01:24:36,657 --> 01:24:39,683
And you're Iucky to be here too.

804
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,387
A few more hours and you
wouId have been beyond our aid.

805
01:24:44,598 --> 01:24:48,694
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

806
01:24:56,343 --> 01:24:58,834
What happened, GandaIf?

807
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:05,184
-Why didn't you meet us?
-I am sorry, Frodo.

808
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:11,653
I was deIayed.

809
01:25:12,526 --> 01:25:16,724
A friendship with Saruman
is not IightIy thrown aside.

810
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:25,464
One iII turn deserves another.
It is over.

811
01:25:25,806 --> 01:25:28,502
Embrace the power of the Ring...

812
01:25:29,076 --> 01:25:31,636
...or embrace your own destruction!

813
01:25:33,914 --> 01:25:37,816
There is onIy one Lord of the Ring.

814
01:25:38,018 --> 01:25:42,011
OnIy one who can bend it to his wiII.

815
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:46,825
And he does not share power.

816
01:26:01,174 --> 01:26:04,507
So you have chosen death.

817
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:18,388
GandaIf? What is it?

818
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:21,156
Nothing, Frodo.

819
01:26:21,795 --> 01:26:23,729
Frodo!

820
01:26:25,098 --> 01:26:27,498
-Sam.
-BIess you, you're awake!

821
01:26:27,701 --> 01:26:30,431
Sam has hardIy Ieft your side.

822
01:26:30,637 --> 01:26:32,832
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. GandaIf?

823
01:26:33,206 --> 01:26:38,303
By the skiIIs of Lord EIrond,
you're beginning to mend.

824
01:26:39,846 --> 01:26:43,407
WeIcome to RivendeII, Frodo Baggins.

825
01:27:31,498 --> 01:27:34,797
-BiIbo!
-HeIIo, Frodo, my Iad.

826
01:27:34,968 --> 01:27:36,663
BiIbo.

827
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,441
''There and Back Again:

828
01:27:43,643 --> 01:27:46,441
A Hobbit's TaIe, by BiIbo Baggins.''

829
01:27:49,516 --> 01:27:53,043
-This is wonderfuI.
-I meant to go back...

830
01:27:53,386 --> 01:27:57,186
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

831
01:27:57,624 --> 01:27:59,956
...visit Lake-town...

832
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:03,561
...see the LoneIy Mountain again.

833
01:28:03,997 --> 01:28:08,934
But age, it seems,
has finaIIy caught up with me.

834
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,810
I miss the Shire.

835
01:28:23,216 --> 01:28:28,381
I spent aII my chiIdhood pretending
I was off somewhere eIse.

836
01:28:28,655 --> 01:28:32,284
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

837
01:28:35,195 --> 01:28:38,824
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

838
01:28:44,037 --> 01:28:47,234
I'm not Iike you, BiIbo.

839
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:50,672
My dear boy.

840
01:28:54,781 --> 01:28:58,740
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed aIready?

841
01:28:59,553 --> 01:29:01,350
No harm in being prepared.

842
01:29:01,555 --> 01:29:04,115
-I thought you wanted to see the EIves.
-I do.

843
01:29:04,324 --> 01:29:07,191
-More than anything.
-I did.

844
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:09,294
It's just....

845
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:12,690
We did what GandaIf wanted, didn't we?

846
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:16,562
We got the Ring this far,
to RivendeII. And I thought...

847
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,069
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

848
01:29:20,273 --> 01:29:21,968
Off home.

849
01:29:26,146 --> 01:29:28,137
You are right, Sam.

850
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:33,081
We did what we set out to do.

851
01:29:33,687 --> 01:29:36,212
The Ring wiII be safe in RivendeII.

852
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,692
I am ready to go home.

853
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:45,489
His strength returns.

854
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:51,399
That wound wiII never fuIIy heaI.
He wiII carry it the rest of his Iife.

855
01:29:51,972 --> 01:29:54,497
And yet to have come so far
stiII bearing the Ring...

856
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:58,405
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resiIience to its eviI.

857
01:29:58,612 --> 01:30:01,979
It is a burden he shouId never
have had to bear.

858
01:30:02,182 --> 01:30:07,620
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-GandaIf, the enemy is moving.

859
01:30:07,821 --> 01:30:12,485
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on RivendeII.

860
01:30:12,692 --> 01:30:15,456
And Saruman, you teII me, has betrayed us.

861
01:30:15,662 --> 01:30:18,893
Our Iist of aIIies grows thin.

862
01:30:19,633 --> 01:30:22,431
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

863
01:30:22,636 --> 01:30:26,265
By fouI craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with GobIin-men.

864
01:30:26,473 --> 01:30:28,941
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

865
01:30:29,242 --> 01:30:33,804
An army that can move in sunIight
and cover great distance at speed.

866
01:30:34,014 --> 01:30:36,414
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

867
01:30:36,816 --> 01:30:40,912
This eviI cannot be conceaIed
by the power of the EIves.

868
01:30:41,121 --> 01:30:45,490
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

869
01:30:49,296 --> 01:30:50,422
GandaIf...

870
01:30:51,731 --> 01:30:54,291
...the Ring cannot stay here.

871
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:17,051
This peril belongs
to ell Middle-eerth.

872
01:31:17,257 --> 01:31:19,987
They must decide now how to end it.

873
01:31:21,061 --> 01:31:24,588
The time of the EIves is over.
My peopIe are Ieaving these shores.

874
01:31:25,265 --> 01:31:28,860
Who wiII you Iook to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

875
01:31:29,069 --> 01:31:34,166
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubIes of others.

876
01:31:35,809 --> 01:31:38,607
It is in Men
that we must pIace our hope.

877
01:31:38,945 --> 01:31:40,674
Men?

878
01:31:41,548 --> 01:31:44,779
Men are weak.
The race of Men is faiIing.

879
01:31:44,984 --> 01:31:49,387
The bIood of Numenor is aII but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

880
01:31:49,756 --> 01:31:53,214
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

881
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:55,053
I was there, GandaIf.

882
01:31:55,729 --> 01:31:58,562
l wes there 3000 yeers ego...

883
01:32:05,372 --> 01:32:07,806
...when lsildur took the Ring.

884
01:32:08,007 --> 01:32:11,875
I was there the day
the strength of Men faiIed.

885
01:32:14,414 --> 01:32:16,974
IsiIdur, hurry! FoIIow me.

886
01:32:18,585 --> 01:32:22,214
l led lsildur into the heert
of Mount Doom...

887
01:32:22,422 --> 01:32:25,983
...where the Ring wes forged,
the one plece it could be destroyed.

888
01:32:26,192 --> 01:32:28,752
Cast it into the fire!

889
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:37,734
-Destroy it!
-No.

890
01:32:39,072 --> 01:32:41,233
IsiIdur!

891
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:46,407
lt should heve ended thet dey,
but evil wes ellowed to endure.

892
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:52,882
IsiIdur kept the Ring.
The Iine of kings is broken.

893
01:32:55,754 --> 01:32:59,417
There's no strength Ieft
in the worId of Men.

894
01:32:59,624 --> 01:33:04,425
-They're scattered, divided, IeaderIess.
-There is one who couId unite them.

895
01:33:04,663 --> 01:33:07,996
One who couId recIaim
the throne of Gondor.

896
01:33:09,734 --> 01:33:13,500
He turned from that path
a Iong time ago.

897
01:33:13,705 --> 01:33:15,832
He has chosen exiIe.

898
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:48,896
You are no EIf.

899
01:33:49,074 --> 01:33:51,167
Men of the South are weIcome here.

900
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:55,302
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to GandaIf the Grey.

901
01:33:56,781 --> 01:33:59,579
Then we are here on common purpose...

902
01:33:59,985 --> 01:34:01,418
...friend.

903
01:34:16,634 --> 01:34:19,569
The shards of NarsiI.

904
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:27,511
The bIade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

905
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:32,645
It's stiII sharp.

906
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:44,619
But no more than a broken heirIoom.

907
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:14,458
Why do you fear the past?

908
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:20,696
You are IsiIdur's heir,
not IsiIdur himseIf.

909
01:35:20,898 --> 01:35:24,334
You are not bound to his fate.

910
01:35:24,869 --> 01:35:28,828
The same bIood fIows in my veins.

911
01:35:31,876 --> 01:35:34,401
The same weakness.

912
01:35:37,115 --> 01:35:39,913
Your time wiII come.

913
01:35:40,118 --> 01:35:44,555
You wiII face the same eviI.
And you wiII defeat it.

914
01:36:35,073 --> 01:36:37,769
You said you'd bind yourseIf to me...

915
01:36:39,811 --> 01:36:44,771
...forsaking the immortaI Iife
of your peopIe.

916
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:47,851
And to that I hoId.

917
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:51,647
I wouId rather share
one Iifetime with you...

918
01:36:51,856 --> 01:36:55,724
...than face aII the Ages
of this worId aIone.

919
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:07,960
I choose a mortaI Iife.

920
01:37:09,307 --> 01:37:13,573
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I wiII...

921
01:37:16,781 --> 01:37:19,306
...Iike my heart.

922
01:37:35,066 --> 01:37:37,534
Strangers from distant Iands,
friends of oId...

923
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:42,929
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

924
01:37:43,575 --> 01:37:48,444
MiddIe-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

925
01:37:48,646 --> 01:37:52,173
You wiII unite, or you wiII faII.

926
01:37:52,417 --> 01:37:56,649
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

927
01:37:58,523 --> 01:38:02,015
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

928
01:38:16,107 --> 01:38:17,802
So it is true.

929
01:38:35,293 --> 01:38:37,352
In a dream...

930
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:42,194
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

931
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,195
...but in the West
a paIe Iight Iingered.

932
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:46,800
A voice was crying:

933
01:38:47,038 --> 01:38:49,973
''Your doom is near at hand.

934
01:38:50,975 --> 01:38:53,705
IsiIdur's Bane is found.''

935
01:38:57,749 --> 01:38:59,546
IsiIdur's Bane.

936
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:01,448
Boromir!

937
01:39:24,575 --> 01:39:28,409
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in ImIadris.

938
01:39:28,579 --> 01:39:32,345
I do not ask your pardon,
Master EIrond...

939
01:39:32,517 --> 01:39:34,610
...for the BIack Speech of Mordor...

940
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,285
...may yet be heard...

941
01:39:36,487 --> 01:39:39,422
...in every corner of the West!

942
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:42,286
The Ring is aItogether eviI.

943
01:39:42,593 --> 01:39:44,117
It is a gift.

944
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:46,788
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

945
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,525
Why not use this Ring?

946
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:52,498
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

947
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:57,038
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the bIood of our peopIe...

948
01:39:57,275 --> 01:39:59,539
...are your Iands kept safe.

949
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:05,648
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

950
01:40:05,883 --> 01:40:09,614
You cannot wieId it.
None of us can.

951
01:40:10,221 --> 01:40:14,282
The One Ring answers to Sauron aIone.
It has no other master.

952
01:40:14,525 --> 01:40:18,052
And what wouId a Ranger know
of this matter?

953
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:20,320
This is no mere Ranger.

954
01:40:21,299 --> 01:40:24,962
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

955
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:28,405
You owe him your aIIegiance.

956
01:40:32,477 --> 01:40:34,411
Aragorn.

957
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,978
This is IsiIdur's heir?

958
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:44,083
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

959
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,795
Gondor has no king.

960
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:57,361
Gondor needs no king.

961
01:41:04,075 --> 01:41:07,704
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

962
01:41:08,713 --> 01:41:12,205
You have onIy one choice.

963
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:14,782
The Ring must be destroyed.

964
01:41:20,024 --> 01:41:22,618
What are we waiting for?

965
01:41:34,705 --> 01:41:37,731
The Ring cannot be destroyed, GimIi,
son of GIoin...

966
01:41:37,975 --> 01:41:42,173
...by any craft that we here possess.

967
01:41:42,713 --> 01:41:46,843
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

968
01:41:47,051 --> 01:41:50,885
OnIy there can it be unmade.

969
01:41:51,989 --> 01:41:54,549
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

970
01:41:54,759 --> 01:41:59,719
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

971
01:42:01,732 --> 01:42:03,723
One of you...

972
01:42:04,235 --> 01:42:06,396
...must do this.

973
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:13,037
One does not simpIy waIk into Mordor.

974
01:42:13,945 --> 01:42:17,574
Its BIack Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

975
01:42:18,416 --> 01:42:22,546
There is eviI there
that does not sIeep.

976
01:42:22,753 --> 01:42:27,019
The Great Eye is ever-watchfuI.

977
01:42:27,758 --> 01:42:29,783
It is a barren wasteIand...

978
01:42:30,027 --> 01:42:33,588
...riddIed with fire, and ash
and dust.

979
01:42:33,798 --> 01:42:37,666
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

980
01:42:37,869 --> 01:42:42,169
Not with 1 0,000 men
couId you do this. It is foIIy.

981
01:42:42,373 --> 01:42:46,867
Have you heard nothing Lord EIrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

982
01:42:47,044 --> 01:42:49,604
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

983
01:42:49,814 --> 01:42:54,478
And if we faiI, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

984
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:59,952
I wiII be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an EIf!

985
01:43:01,959 --> 01:43:04,450
Never trust an EIf!

986
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:11,466
Do you not understand? WhiIe you bicker
amongst yourseIves, Sauron's power grows!

987
01:43:11,802 --> 01:43:14,703
None can escape it!
You'II aII be destroyed!

988
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,721
I wiII take it.

989
01:43:37,662 --> 01:43:40,222
I wiII take it.

990
01:43:46,003 --> 01:43:49,097
I wiII take the Ring to Mordor.

991
01:43:57,181 --> 01:43:58,443
Though...

992
01:44:01,552 --> 01:44:03,349
...I do not know the way.

993
01:44:05,389 --> 01:44:09,689
I wiII heIp you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

994
01:44:09,894 --> 01:44:13,295
...as Iong as it is yours to bear.

995
01:44:14,398 --> 01:44:17,458
If by my Iife
or death I can protect you...

996
01:44:18,202 --> 01:44:19,533
...I wiII.

997
01:44:22,807 --> 01:44:25,071
You have my sword.

998
01:44:26,877 --> 01:44:28,970
And you have my bow.

999
01:44:29,547 --> 01:44:32,038
And my ax.

1000
01:44:39,056 --> 01:44:42,048
You carry the fates
of us aII, IittIe one.

1001
01:44:44,061 --> 01:44:47,724
If this is indeed
the wiII of the CounciI...

1002
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:50,667
...then Gondor wiII see it done.

1003
01:44:53,237 --> 01:44:58,004
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardIy possibIe to separate you...

1004
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:03,078
...even when he is summoned
to a secret CounciI and you are not.

1005
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:05,581
We're coming too!

1006
01:45:07,585 --> 01:45:10,383
You'II have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1007
01:45:10,588 --> 01:45:13,955
Anyway, you need peopIe
of inteIIigence on this sort of...

1008
01:45:14,325 --> 01:45:15,587
...mission.

1009
01:45:15,826 --> 01:45:17,259
Quest.

1010
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:18,752
Thing.

1011
01:45:20,631 --> 01:45:23,361
WeII, that ruIes you out, Pip.

1012
01:45:24,902 --> 01:45:26,836
Nine companions.

1013
01:45:28,606 --> 01:45:30,437
So be it.

1014
01:45:30,775 --> 01:45:33,835
You shaII be
the FeIIowship of the Ring.

1015
01:45:34,445 --> 01:45:36,276
Great!

1016
01:45:36,547 --> 01:45:38,777
Where are we going?

1017
01:46:24,902 --> 01:46:28,394
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted aII your Iife.

1018
01:46:28,872 --> 01:46:30,601
That you'd never escape your fate.

1019
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:34,735
The skiII of the EIves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1020
01:46:35,176 --> 01:46:39,112
...but onIy you have the power
to wieId it.

1021
01:46:40,146 --> 01:46:42,580
I do not want that power.

1022
01:46:42,747 --> 01:46:45,477
I have never wanted it.

1023
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:49,344
You are the Iast of that bIoodIine.
There is no other.

1024
01:46:53,888 --> 01:46:56,220
My oId sword! Sting.

1025
01:46:56,423 --> 01:46:57,617
Here, take it. Take it.

1026
01:47:03,127 --> 01:47:06,995
-It's so Iight.
-Yes. Made by the EIves, you know.

1027
01:47:07,697 --> 01:47:11,861
The bIade gIows bIue
when Orcs are cIose.

1028
01:47:12,067 --> 01:47:16,663
And it's times Iike that, my Iad,
when you have to be extra carefuI.

1029
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:19,338
Here's a pretty thing.

1030
01:47:19,737 --> 01:47:21,034
MithriI.

1031
01:47:21,839 --> 01:47:26,208
As Iight as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scaIes.

1032
01:47:26,409 --> 01:47:29,674
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1033
01:47:37,717 --> 01:47:39,742
My oId ring.

1034
01:47:41,018 --> 01:47:44,920
I shouId very much Iike...

1035
01:47:45,154 --> 01:47:49,181
...to hoId it again, one Iast time.

1036
01:48:06,535 --> 01:48:10,198
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1037
01:48:10,537 --> 01:48:14,598
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1038
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:22,204
I'm sorry for everything.

1039
01:48:36,988 --> 01:48:41,391
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1040
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:45,319
On you who traveI with him,
no oath...

1041
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,688
...nor bond is Iaid to go further
than you wiII.

1042
01:48:52,098 --> 01:48:54,623
FareweII. HoId to your purpose.

1043
01:48:55,099 --> 01:48:59,001
May the bIessings of EIves and Men...

1044
01:48:59,569 --> 01:49:02,197
...and aII Free FoIk go with you.

1045
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:09,336
The FeIIowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1046
01:49:27,754 --> 01:49:30,245
Mordor, GandaIf, is it Ieft or right?

1047
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:32,621
Left.

1048
01:50:52,209 --> 01:50:56,646
We must hold to thls course, west
of the Mlsty Mountalns, for 40 days.

1049
01:50:56,846 --> 01:51:00,577
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
wlll stlll be open to us.

1050
01:51:00,814 --> 01:51:04,375
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

1051
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:08,384
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1052
01:51:10,187 --> 01:51:11,211
Move your feet.

1053
01:51:11,421 --> 01:51:12,786
-You Iook good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

1054
01:51:12,989 --> 01:51:14,388
Faster!

1055
01:51:15,724 --> 01:51:19,558
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1056
01:51:19,727 --> 01:51:22,491
...I'd say we were taking
the Iong way 'round.

1057
01:51:22,995 --> 01:51:26,055
GandaIf, we couId pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1058
01:51:26,698 --> 01:51:30,566
My cousin BaIin wouId give us
a royaI weIcome.

1059
01:51:30,801 --> 01:51:36,103
No, I wouId not take the road through
Moria unIess I had no other choice.

1060
01:51:45,376 --> 01:51:46,536
Sorry!

1061
01:51:47,245 --> 01:51:48,735
Get him!

1062
01:51:50,213 --> 01:51:52,681
-For the Shire!
-HoId him. HoId him down, Merry!

1063
01:51:53,215 --> 01:51:55,581
GentIemen, that's enough.

1064
01:51:59,353 --> 01:52:00,945
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1065
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:04,049
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cIoud.

1066
01:52:04,256 --> 01:52:06,952
It's moving fast.

1067
01:52:07,224 --> 01:52:09,385
Against the wind.

1068
01:52:10,126 --> 01:52:12,253
-Crebain from DunIand!
-Hide!

1069
01:52:12,461 --> 01:52:15,225
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

1070
01:52:48,617 --> 01:52:50,346
Spies of Saruman.

1071
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:54,384
The passage south is being watched.

1072
01:52:55,489 --> 01:52:58,856
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1073
01:53:11,466 --> 01:53:13,161
Frodo!

1074
01:53:32,146 --> 01:53:34,444
Boromir.

1075
01:53:34,646 --> 01:53:38,878
It is a strange fate that we shouId
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1076
01:53:39,083 --> 01:53:42,177
...over so smaII a thing.

1077
01:53:45,421 --> 01:53:47,389
Such a IittIe thing.

1078
01:53:47,589 --> 01:53:49,022
Boromir!

1079
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:52,318
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1080
01:54:02,165 --> 01:54:04,190
As you wish.

1081
01:54:04,933 --> 01:54:06,958
I care not.

1082
01:54:42,324 --> 01:54:47,023
So, GandaIf, you try
to Iead them over Caradhras.

1083
01:54:47,227 --> 01:54:51,823
And if that faiIs,
where then wiII you go?

1084
01:54:53,131 --> 01:54:56,066
If the mountaln defeats you...

1085
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:00,737
... wlll you rlsk
a more dangerous road?

1086
01:55:13,077 --> 01:55:16,012
There is a feII voice on the air.

1087
01:55:17,079 --> 01:55:18,569
It's Saruman!

1088
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:32,184
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
GandaIf, we must turn back!

1089
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:34,221
No!

1090
01:56:40,634 --> 01:56:42,499
We must get off the mountain!

1091
01:56:42,936 --> 01:56:47,305
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1092
01:56:47,504 --> 01:56:50,871
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too cIose to Isengard!

1093
01:56:51,075 --> 01:56:54,772
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1094
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:57,808
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1095
01:56:59,647 --> 01:57:03,515
Morla. You fear to go
lnto those mlnes.

1096
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:09,212
The Dwarves deIved too greediIy
and too deep.

1097
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:14,889
You know what they awoke
ln the darkness of Khazad-dum.'

1098
01:57:16,156 --> 01:57:19,648
Shadow and fIame.

1099
01:57:23,029 --> 01:57:25,759
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1100
01:57:30,433 --> 01:57:32,594
We cannot stay here!

1101
01:57:32,767 --> 01:57:35,565
This wiII be the death of the Hobbits.

1102
01:57:35,737 --> 01:57:37,398
Frodo?

1103
01:57:40,439 --> 01:57:43,306
We wiII go through the mines.

1104
01:57:44,108 --> 01:57:46,042
So be it.

1105
01:57:52,614 --> 01:57:56,482
Frodo, come and heIp an oId man.

1106
01:58:00,052 --> 01:58:02,282
How is your shouIder?

1107
01:58:02,454 --> 01:58:05,685
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?

1108
01:58:07,290 --> 01:58:09,781
You feeI its power growing, don't you?

1109
01:58:10,259 --> 01:58:13,160
I've feIt it too.
You must be carefuI now.

1110
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:17,496
EviI wiII be drawn to you
from outside the FeIIowship.

1111
01:58:17,664 --> 01:58:20,258
And, I fear, from within.

1112
01:58:22,867 --> 01:58:27,031
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourseIf.

1113
01:58:27,203 --> 01:58:30,104
Trust your own strengths.

1114
01:58:30,271 --> 01:58:32,831
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this worId...

1115
01:58:33,007 --> 01:58:35,100
...for good or for eviI.

1116
01:58:35,274 --> 01:58:37,572
Some are greater than I am.

1117
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:41,705
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1118
01:58:43,147 --> 01:58:44,478
The waIIs...

1119
01:58:45,181 --> 01:58:47,274
...of Moria.

1120
01:58:52,986 --> 01:58:55,978
Dwarf doors are invisibIe when cIosed.

1121
01:58:56,188 --> 01:59:00,648
Yes, GimIi, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1122
01:59:00,992 --> 01:59:03,460
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1123
01:59:11,463 --> 01:59:14,796
WeII, Iet's see.

1124
01:59:14,998 --> 01:59:16,363
IthiIdin.

1125
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,367
It mirrors onIy starIight
and moonIight.

1126
01:59:34,477 --> 01:59:38,538
It reads, ''The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1127
01:59:39,147 --> 01:59:43,743
-Speak, friend, and enter.''
-What do you suppose that means?

1128
01:59:43,982 --> 01:59:48,715
It's simpIe. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors wiII open.

1129
02:00:12,501 --> 02:00:13,627
Nothing's happening.

1130
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:24,872
I once knew every speII
in aII the tongues of EIves...

1131
02:00:25,143 --> 02:00:27,907
...Men and Orcs.

1132
02:00:28,212 --> 02:00:29,406
What are you going to do, then?

1133
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,875
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1134
02:00:32,148 --> 02:00:34,082
And if that does not shatter them...

1135
02:00:34,282 --> 02:00:37,012
...and I am aIIowed a IittIe peace
from fooIish questions...

1136
02:00:37,184 --> 02:00:40,642
...I wiII try to find the opening words.

1137
02:00:53,461 --> 02:00:55,691
Mines are no pIace for a pony.

1138
02:00:56,230 --> 02:01:00,326
-Even one so brave as BiII.
-Bye-bye, BiII.

1139
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,264
Go on, BiII. Go on.

1140
02:01:04,836 --> 02:01:08,363
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1141
02:01:15,143 --> 02:01:17,737
Do not disturb the water.

1142
02:01:17,944 --> 02:01:19,844
Oh, it's useIess.

1143
02:01:32,488 --> 02:01:34,683
It's a riddIe.

1144
02:01:37,423 --> 02:01:40,551
''Speak 'friend' and enter.''

1145
02:01:40,925 --> 02:01:43,826
What's the EIvish word for ''friend''?

1146
02:01:45,295 --> 02:01:46,592
Mellon.

1147
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:09,510
Soon, Master EIf, you wiII enjoy
the fabIed hospitaIity of the Dwarves.

1148
02:02:09,978 --> 02:02:15,678
Roaring fires, maIt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1149
02:02:17,215 --> 02:02:20,275
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin BaIin.

1150
02:02:20,618 --> 02:02:23,052
And they caII it a mine.

1151
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:25,187
A mine!

1152
02:02:26,255 --> 02:02:29,588
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1153
02:02:35,728 --> 02:02:37,286
No....

1154
02:02:38,563 --> 02:02:40,190
No!

1155
02:02:42,833 --> 02:02:44,391
GobIins.

1156
02:02:48,303 --> 02:02:52,603
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We shouId never have come here.

1157
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:56,234
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1158
02:02:59,010 --> 02:03:01,410
-Frodo!
-HeIp!

1159
02:03:01,611 --> 02:03:03,203
Strider!

1160
02:03:03,413 --> 02:03:06,211
-HeIp!
-Get off him!

1161
02:03:06,414 --> 02:03:07,403
Aragorn!

1162
02:03:17,822 --> 02:03:18,811
Frodo!

1163
02:03:45,173 --> 02:03:46,231
Into the mines!

1164
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:49,637
-LegoIas!
-Into the cave!

1165
02:03:53,911 --> 02:03:55,674
Run!

1166
02:04:12,557 --> 02:04:16,152
We now have but one choice.

1167
02:04:16,359 --> 02:04:21,228
We must face the Iong dark of Moria.

1168
02:04:21,495 --> 02:04:23,463
Be on your guard.

1169
02:04:23,664 --> 02:04:27,100
There are oIder
and fouIer things than Orcs...

1170
02:04:27,299 --> 02:04:30,826
...in the deep pIaces of the worId.

1171
02:04:38,807 --> 02:04:42,709
QuietIy now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1172
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:46,778
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1173
02:05:32,543 --> 02:05:36,240
The weaIth of Moria was not in goId...

1174
02:05:36,411 --> 02:05:38,845
...or jeweIs...

1175
02:05:39,014 --> 02:05:42,040
...but mithriI.

1176
02:06:00,394 --> 02:06:05,263
BiIbo had a shirt of mithriI rings
that Thorin gave him.

1177
02:06:05,531 --> 02:06:09,467
-Oh, that was a kingIy gift.
-Yes.

1178
02:06:09,632 --> 02:06:11,566
I never toId him...

1179
02:06:11,734 --> 02:06:16,694
...but its worth was greater than
the vaIue of the Shire.

1180
02:06:29,246 --> 02:06:30,941
Pippin.

1181
02:06:51,493 --> 02:06:54,462
I have no memory of this pIace.

1182
02:06:56,497 --> 02:06:57,964
-Are we Iost?
-No.

1183
02:06:58,131 --> 02:07:00,656
-I think we are.
-GandaIf's thinking.

1184
02:07:00,865 --> 02:07:02,332
-Merry?
-What?

1185
02:07:02,534 --> 02:07:04,468
I'm hungry.

1186
02:07:15,843 --> 02:07:20,280
-There's something down there.
-It's GoIIum.

1187
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:24,575
-GoIIum?
-He's been foIIowing us for three days.

1188
02:07:24,814 --> 02:07:28,978
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?
-Escaped...

1189
02:07:29,684 --> 02:07:31,311
...or was set Ioose.

1190
02:07:31,853 --> 02:07:35,482
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1191
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:40,888
He wiII never be rid of his need for it.

1192
02:07:41,058 --> 02:07:46,758
He hates and Ioves the Ring,
as he hates and Ioves himseIf.

1193
02:07:46,928 --> 02:07:51,831
SmeagoI's Iife is a sad story.

1194
02:07:51,998 --> 02:07:57,937
Yes, SmeagoI he was once caIIed.
Before the Ring found him.

1195
02:07:58,903 --> 02:08:01,701
Before it drove him mad.

1196
02:08:01,938 --> 02:08:04,839
It's a pity BiIbo didn't kiII him
when he had the chance.

1197
02:08:05,042 --> 02:08:06,236
Pity?

1198
02:08:07,308 --> 02:08:10,243
It is pity that stayed BiIbo's hand.

1199
02:08:11,111 --> 02:08:16,344
Many that Iive deserve death.
Some that die deserve Iife.

1200
02:08:17,816 --> 02:08:20,250
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1201
02:08:22,685 --> 02:08:26,621
Do not be too eager
to deaI out death and judgment.

1202
02:08:26,854 --> 02:08:29,755
Even the very wise
cannot see aII ends.

1203
02:08:30,357 --> 02:08:36,262
My heart teIIs me that GoIIum has some
part to pIay yet, for good or iII...

1204
02:08:37,062 --> 02:08:39,929
...before this is over.

1205
02:08:41,431 --> 02:08:45,265
The pity of BiIbo
may ruIe the fate of many.

1206
02:08:51,938 --> 02:08:55,271
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1207
02:08:56,707 --> 02:08:58,766
I wish none of this had happened.

1208
02:08:58,942 --> 02:09:03,970
So do aII who Iive to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1209
02:09:04,779 --> 02:09:10,274
AII we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1210
02:09:11,783 --> 02:09:15,776
There are other forces at work in this
worId, Frodo, besides the wiII of eviI.

1211
02:09:16,153 --> 02:09:18,621
BiIbo was meant to find the Ring.

1212
02:09:19,122 --> 02:09:23,456
In which case,
you aIso were meant to have it.

1213
02:09:23,691 --> 02:09:26,785
And that is an encouraging thought.

1214
02:09:31,664 --> 02:09:33,632
It's that way.

1215
02:09:33,898 --> 02:09:36,196
-He's remembered.
-No.

1216
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:40,200
But the air doesn't smeII
so fouI down here.

1217
02:09:40,568 --> 02:09:45,596
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
aIways foIIow your nose.

1218
02:10:00,415 --> 02:10:04,579
Let me risk a IittIe more Iight.

1219
02:10:09,186 --> 02:10:11,279
BehoId...

1220
02:10:11,689 --> 02:10:16,956
...the great reaIm
and Dwarf-city of DwarrowdeIf.

1221
02:10:19,393 --> 02:10:22,829
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1222
02:10:47,778 --> 02:10:49,473
GimIi!

1223
02:10:56,884 --> 02:10:58,511
No!

1224
02:11:01,121 --> 02:11:04,284
Oh, no.

1225
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:07,352
No.

1226
02:11:14,662 --> 02:11:16,653
''Here Iies BaIin...

1227
02:11:17,097 --> 02:11:19,088
...son of Fundin...

1228
02:11:19,399 --> 02:11:22,027
...Lord of Moria.''

1229
02:11:23,101 --> 02:11:24,796
He is dead, then.

1230
02:11:26,536 --> 02:11:28,231
It's as I feared.

1231
02:11:46,484 --> 02:11:49,385
We must move on. We cannot Iinger.

1232
02:11:49,585 --> 02:11:54,284
''They have taken the bridge
and the second haII.

1233
02:11:55,389 --> 02:11:57,983
We have barred the gates...

1234
02:11:58,658 --> 02:12:01,126
...but cannot hoId them for Iong.

1235
02:12:01,326 --> 02:12:04,124
The ground shakes.

1236
02:12:04,561 --> 02:12:06,119
Drums...

1237
02:12:06,529 --> 02:12:09,896
...drums in the deep.

1238
02:12:13,433 --> 02:12:15,458
We cannot get out.

1239
02:12:17,503 --> 02:12:21,303
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1240
02:12:22,973 --> 02:12:25,567
We cannot get out.

1241
02:12:28,576 --> 02:12:30,476
They are coming.''

1242
02:13:13,506 --> 02:13:15,371
FooI of a Took!

1243
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:19,540
Throw yourseIf in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1244
02:13:45,426 --> 02:13:47,121
Frodo!

1245
02:13:49,429 --> 02:13:50,862
Orcs.

1246
02:13:57,901 --> 02:13:59,892
Get back! Stay cIose to GandaIf!

1247
02:14:07,107 --> 02:14:08,938
They have a cave-troII.

1248
02:14:24,752 --> 02:14:25,878
Let them come!

1249
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:29,947
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who stiII draws breath.

1250
02:16:48,779 --> 02:16:51,543
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1251
02:16:56,283 --> 02:16:58,012
Frodo!

1252
02:17:31,572 --> 02:17:33,437
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1253
02:17:34,442 --> 02:17:36,307
Frodo!

1254
02:18:21,472 --> 02:18:23,337
Frodo!

1255
02:19:23,545 --> 02:19:24,842
Oh, no.

1256
02:19:33,218 --> 02:19:35,152
He's aIive.

1257
02:19:37,587 --> 02:19:40,556
I'm aII right. I'm not hurt.

1258
02:19:40,756 --> 02:19:42,986
You shouId be dead.

1259
02:19:43,191 --> 02:19:45,682
That spear wouId have skewered
a wiId boar.

1260
02:19:45,893 --> 02:19:50,626
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1261
02:19:56,534 --> 02:19:57,558
MithriI.

1262
02:20:00,369 --> 02:20:02,963
You are fuII of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1263
02:20:09,008 --> 02:20:10,908
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!

1264
02:20:25,885 --> 02:20:27,546
This way!

1265
02:21:37,899 --> 02:21:40,868
What is this new deviIry?

1266
02:21:56,944 --> 02:21:59,708
A BaIrog.

1267
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:03,174
A demon of the ancient worId.

1268
02:22:05,416 --> 02:22:07,816
This foe is beyond any of you.

1269
02:22:08,986 --> 02:22:10,544
Run!

1270
02:22:17,925 --> 02:22:19,392
QuickIy!

1271
02:22:36,003 --> 02:22:37,300
GandaIf.

1272
02:22:37,904 --> 02:22:39,496
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1273
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:43,431
The bridge is near.

1274
02:22:45,476 --> 02:22:49,606
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1275
02:23:18,697 --> 02:23:20,460
GandaIf!

1276
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:39,938
Merry! Pippin!

1277
02:23:51,052 --> 02:23:52,576
Sam!

1278
02:23:55,321 --> 02:23:58,552
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1279
02:24:01,592 --> 02:24:03,025
Not the beard!

1280
02:24:16,234 --> 02:24:18,168
Steady.

1281
02:24:20,237 --> 02:24:21,898
HoId on!

1282
02:24:42,951 --> 02:24:44,145
Hang on!

1283
02:24:54,926 --> 02:24:56,689
Lean forward!

1284
02:24:59,695 --> 02:25:00,719
Steady.

1285
02:25:02,031 --> 02:25:03,191
Come on!

1286
02:25:03,398 --> 02:25:04,888
Now!

1287
02:25:22,077 --> 02:25:23,908
Over the bridge!

1288
02:25:24,111 --> 02:25:25,703
FIy!

1289
02:26:10,309 --> 02:26:12,368
You cannot pass!

1290
02:26:12,577 --> 02:26:14,135
GandaIf!

1291
02:26:18,414 --> 02:26:23,283
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wieIder of the fIame of Anor.

1292
02:26:24,284 --> 02:26:28,084
The dark fire wiII not avaiI you,
fIame of Udun!

1293
02:26:38,025 --> 02:26:39,993
Go back to the Shadow.

1294
02:26:47,832 --> 02:26:52,292
You shaII not pass!

1295
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:23,322
-No! No!
-GandaIf!

1296
02:27:30,994 --> 02:27:33,428
FIy, you fooIs!

1297
02:27:37,565 --> 02:27:39,726
No!

1298
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:48,031
Aragorn!

1299
02:28:45,309 --> 02:28:48,107
LegoIas, get them up.

1300
02:28:52,212 --> 02:28:54,077
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1301
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:57,909
By nightfaII, these hiIIs wiII
be swarming with Orcs.

1302
02:28:58,116 --> 02:29:01,449
We must reach the woods of LothIorien.

1303
02:29:02,386 --> 02:29:05,651
Come, Boromir. LegoIas.
GimIi, get them up.

1304
02:29:07,157 --> 02:29:09,387
On your feet, Sam.

1305
02:29:09,724 --> 02:29:11,214
Frodo?

1306
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:14,955
Frodo!

1307
02:30:07,862 --> 02:30:10,387
Stay cIose, young Hobbits!

1308
02:30:11,164 --> 02:30:15,294
They say that a great sorceress
Iives in these woods.

1309
02:30:15,501 --> 02:30:18,026
An EIf-witch...

1310
02:30:18,568 --> 02:30:21,435
...of terribIe power.

1311
02:30:22,004 --> 02:30:24,199
AII who Iook upon her...

1312
02:30:24,405 --> 02:30:26,202
...faII under her speII.

1313
02:30:26,407 --> 02:30:27,704
Frodol

1314
02:30:29,942 --> 02:30:32,001
And are never seen again.

1315
02:30:32,211 --> 02:30:36,705
Your coming to us is
es the footsteps of doom.

1316
02:30:36,913 --> 02:30:40,644
You bring greet evil here,
Ring-beerer.

1317
02:30:40,849 --> 02:30:42,578
Mr. Frodo?

1318
02:30:47,888 --> 02:30:53,485
WeII, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easiIy.

1319
02:30:53,690 --> 02:30:56,921
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1320
02:31:05,865 --> 02:31:10,461
The Dwarf breathes so Ioud,
we couId have shot him in the dark.

1321
02:31:28,613 --> 02:31:30,877
So much for the Iegendary courtesy
of the EIves!

1322
02:31:31,082 --> 02:31:32,982
Speak words we can aII understand!

1323
02:31:33,149 --> 02:31:37,711
We have not had deaIings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1324
02:31:37,986 --> 02:31:40,511
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1325
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,327
That was not so courteous.

1326
02:31:55,864 --> 02:31:59,891
You bring great eviI with you.

1327
02:32:01,668 --> 02:32:03,863
You can go no further.

1328
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:43,888
GandaIf's death was not in vain.

1329
02:32:45,030 --> 02:32:46,930
Nor wouId he have you give up hope.

1330
02:32:48,432 --> 02:32:51,765
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1331
02:32:52,634 --> 02:32:55,728
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1332
02:32:58,570 --> 02:33:00,629
You wiII foIIow me.

1333
02:33:12,347 --> 02:33:14,281
Caras GaIadhon.

1334
02:33:14,915 --> 02:33:17,884
The heart of EIvendom on earth.

1335
02:33:18,051 --> 02:33:23,717
ReaIm of the Lord CeIeborn
and of GaIadrieI, Lady of Light.

1336
02:34:42,805 --> 02:34:45,899
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1337
02:34:46,574 --> 02:34:51,739
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1338
02:34:53,480 --> 02:34:57,917
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from RivendeII.

1339
02:34:58,148 --> 02:34:59,979
TeII me, where is GandaIf?

1340
02:35:00,150 --> 02:35:03,278
For I much desire to speak with him.

1341
02:35:03,451 --> 02:35:06,249
I can no Ionger see him from afar.

1342
02:35:07,122 --> 02:35:12,287
GandaIf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this Iand.

1343
02:35:12,525 --> 02:35:14,993
He has faIIen into Shadow.

1344
02:35:19,662 --> 02:35:24,156
He was taken by both Shadow and fIame.

1345
02:35:25,833 --> 02:35:29,530
A BaIrog of Morgoth.

1346
02:35:30,269 --> 02:35:33,636
For we went needIessIy
into the net of Moria.

1347
02:35:35,772 --> 02:35:39,003
NeedIess were none of the deeds
of GandaIf in Iife.

1348
02:35:39,642 --> 02:35:42,941
We do not yet know his fuII purpose.

1349
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:52,014
Do not Iet the great emptiness
of Khazad-dum fiII your heart...

1350
02:35:52,184 --> 02:35:54,516
...GimIi, son of GIoin.

1351
02:35:55,519 --> 02:35:59,046
For the worId has grown
fuII of periI...

1352
02:36:00,522 --> 02:36:03,184
...and in aII Iands...

1353
02:36:03,358 --> 02:36:06,850
...Iove is now mingIed with grief.

1354
02:36:19,501 --> 02:36:22,197
What now becomes of this FeIIowship?

1355
02:36:22,770 --> 02:36:25,762
Without GandaIf, hope is Iost.

1356
02:36:28,706 --> 02:36:32,005
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1357
02:36:32,177 --> 02:36:35,271
Stray but a IittIe and it wiII faiI...

1358
02:36:36,013 --> 02:36:38,846
...to the ruin of aII.

1359
02:36:43,184 --> 02:36:49,020
Yet hope remains
whiIe the Company is true.

1360
02:36:50,555 --> 02:36:55,322
Do not Iet your hearts be troubIed.
Go now and rest...

1361
02:36:55,724 --> 02:36:59,387
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toiI.

1362
02:37:01,662 --> 02:37:03,789
Tonight, you wiII sIeep....

1363
02:37:04,064 --> 02:37:07,500
Welcome, Frodo of the Shlre...

1364
02:37:08,933 --> 02:37:10,730
...one who has seen the Eyel

1365
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:27,936
A Iament for GandaIf.

1366
02:37:35,217 --> 02:37:36,741
What do they say about him?

1367
02:37:37,084 --> 02:37:39,678
I have not the heart to teII you.

1368
02:37:42,588 --> 02:37:44,818
For me, the grief is stiII too near.

1369
02:37:47,792 --> 02:37:50,625
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1370
02:37:50,794 --> 02:37:53,820
There shouId be a verse about them.

1371
02:37:57,298 --> 02:37:59,289
The flnest rockets ever seen

1372
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:03,232
They burst ln stars of blue and green

1373
02:38:04,169 --> 02:38:09,368
Or after thunder, sllver showers

1374
02:38:10,073 --> 02:38:12,871
Came falllng llke a raln of flowers

1375
02:38:13,041 --> 02:38:16,943
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a Iong road.

1376
02:38:27,718 --> 02:38:30,414
Take some rest.

1377
02:38:30,620 --> 02:38:33,282
These borders are weII-protected.

1378
02:38:33,487 --> 02:38:36,012
I wiII find no rest here.

1379
02:38:38,858 --> 02:38:41,850
I heard her voice inside my head.

1380
02:38:42,194 --> 02:38:45,823
She spoke of my father
and the faII of Gondor.

1381
02:38:46,029 --> 02:38:51,490
She said to me,
''Even now there is hope Ieft.''

1382
02:38:52,867 --> 02:38:55,700
But I cannot see it.

1383
02:38:57,036 --> 02:38:59,527
It is Iong since we had any hope.

1384
02:39:09,711 --> 02:39:11,838
My father is a nobIe man.

1385
02:39:12,647 --> 02:39:14,842
But his ruIe is faiIing...

1386
02:39:17,983 --> 02:39:20,611
...and our peopIe Iose faith.

1387
02:39:22,253 --> 02:39:25,552
He Iooks to me to make things right,
and I wouId do it.

1388
02:39:25,754 --> 02:39:29,281
I wouId see the gIory
of Gondor restored.

1389
02:39:32,359 --> 02:39:35,123
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1390
02:39:35,761 --> 02:39:37,956
The White Tower of EctheIion.

1391
02:39:38,163 --> 02:39:41,792
GIimmering Iike a spike
of pearI and siIver.

1392
02:39:42,465 --> 02:39:45,957
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1393
02:39:48,837 --> 02:39:51,067
Have you ever been caIIed home...

1394
02:39:51,271 --> 02:39:54,934
...by the cIear ringing
of siIver trumpets?

1395
02:39:55,841 --> 02:39:58,810
I have seen the White City...

1396
02:39:59,276 --> 02:40:00,641
...Iong ago.

1397
02:40:01,612 --> 02:40:06,549
One day, our paths wiII Iead us there.

1398
02:40:07,515 --> 02:40:10,450
And the tower guard
shaII take up the caII:

1399
02:40:10,883 --> 02:40:14,216
''The Lords of Gondor have returned.''

1400
02:41:21,397 --> 02:41:23,957
WiII you Iook into the mirror?

1401
02:41:24,164 --> 02:41:25,688
What wiII I see?

1402
02:41:28,668 --> 02:41:31,000
Even the wisest cannot teII.

1403
02:41:31,903 --> 02:41:33,734
For the mirror...

1404
02:41:33,937 --> 02:41:36,462
...shows many things.

1405
02:41:39,474 --> 02:41:41,874
Things that were...

1406
02:41:42,076 --> 02:41:44,636
...things that are...

1407
02:41:45,412 --> 02:41:47,380
...and some things...

1408
02:41:50,948 --> 02:41:54,281
...that have not yet come to pass.

1409
02:43:16,904 --> 02:43:19,737
I know what it is you saw.

1410
02:43:22,107 --> 02:43:24,598
For it is aIso in my mind.

1411
02:43:26,377 --> 02:43:30,404
It ls what wlll come to pass
lf you should fall.

1412
02:43:32,813 --> 02:43:37,682
The Fellowshlp ls breaklng.
It ls already begun.

1413
02:43:38,317 --> 02:43:41,616
He wlll try to take the Rlng.

1414
02:43:41,820 --> 02:43:43,811
You know of whom I speak.

1415
02:43:44,821 --> 02:43:49,485
One by one, lt wlll destroy them all.

1416
02:43:50,992 --> 02:43:53,426
If you ask lt of me...

1417
02:43:53,827 --> 02:43:56,887
... I wlll glve you the One Rlng.

1418
02:43:57,930 --> 02:44:00,125
You offer it to me freeIy.

1419
02:44:04,702 --> 02:44:08,638
I do not deny that my heart
has greatIy desired this.

1420
02:44:15,007 --> 02:44:18,272
In pIace of a Dark Lord,
you wouId have a queen...

1421
02:44:18,743 --> 02:44:22,543
...not dark but beautifuI,
and terribIe as the dawn!

1422
02:44:23,180 --> 02:44:26,206
Treacherous as the sea!

1423
02:44:26,715 --> 02:44:31,652
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1424
02:44:32,085 --> 02:44:34,451
AII shaII Iove me...

1425
02:44:34,688 --> 02:44:37,521
...and despair.

1426
02:44:51,599 --> 02:44:55,933
I pass the test. I wiII diminish...

1427
02:44:56,201 --> 02:44:58,669
...and go into the West...

1428
02:44:58,869 --> 02:45:03,306
-...and remain GaIadrieI.
-I cannot do this aIone.

1429
02:45:07,142 --> 02:45:11,272
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1430
02:45:12,178 --> 02:45:13,668
...is to be aIone.

1431
02:45:17,114 --> 02:45:19,878
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1432
02:45:20,083 --> 02:45:21,675
And I am its keeper.

1433
02:45:24,886 --> 02:45:28,515
This task was appointed to you.

1434
02:45:29,556 --> 02:45:32,423
And if you do not find a way...

1435
02:45:33,625 --> 02:45:35,616
...no one wiII.

1436
02:45:36,027 --> 02:45:39,190
Then I know what I must do.

1437
02:45:39,862 --> 02:45:41,056
It's just...

1438
02:45:44,299 --> 02:45:46,563
...I'm afraid to do it.

1439
02:45:50,069 --> 02:45:55,200
Even the smaIIest person can change
the course of the future.

1440
02:46:00,542 --> 02:46:06,840
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1441
02:46:07,213 --> 02:46:10,580
They were EIves once.

1442
02:46:11,783 --> 02:46:15,116
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1443
02:46:15,319 --> 02:46:18,482
...tortured and mutiIated.

1444
02:46:18,821 --> 02:46:24,123
A ruined and terribIe form of Iife.

1445
02:46:24,424 --> 02:46:26,221
And now...

1446
02:46:27,693 --> 02:46:29,593
...perfected.

1447
02:46:30,295 --> 02:46:33,458
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1448
02:46:35,398 --> 02:46:37,730
...whom do you serve?

1449
02:46:37,934 --> 02:46:40,425
Saruman!

1450
02:47:01,248 --> 02:47:04,684
Hunt them down. Do not stop
untiI they are found.

1451
02:47:04,885 --> 02:47:07,820
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1452
02:47:08,020 --> 02:47:10,989
You wiII taste Man-fIesh!

1453
02:47:16,058 --> 02:47:19,755
One of the haIfIings carries
something of great vaIue.

1454
02:47:19,927 --> 02:47:24,125
Bring them to me aIive and unspoiIed.

1455
02:47:25,930 --> 02:47:27,227
KiII the others.

1456
02:47:46,411 --> 02:47:51,872
Never before have we cIad strangers
in the garb of our own peopIe.

1457
02:47:52,915 --> 02:47:56,715
May these cIoaks heIp shieId you
from unfriendIy eyes.

1458
02:48:03,922 --> 02:48:05,549
Lembas.

1459
02:48:05,789 --> 02:48:07,381
EIvish waybread.

1460
02:48:09,893 --> 02:48:12,885
One smaII bite is enough to fiII
the stomach of a grown man.

1461
02:48:19,366 --> 02:48:21,334
How many did you eat?

1462
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:23,161
Four.

1463
02:48:28,938 --> 02:48:31,566
Every league you travel south,
the danger wlll lncrease.

1464
02:48:31,741 --> 02:48:35,871
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduln.

1465
02:48:36,043 --> 02:48:38,534
Nor wlll you flnd safety
on the western bank.

1466
02:48:38,745 --> 02:48:42,579
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1467
02:48:42,748 --> 02:48:47,845
SeIdom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1468
02:49:00,525 --> 02:49:05,121
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the FaIIs of Rauros.

1469
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:27,241
My gift for you, LegoIas,
is a bow of the GaIadhrim.

1470
02:49:27,410 --> 02:49:30,902
Worthy of the skiII
of our woodIand kin.

1471
02:49:36,282 --> 02:49:38,750
These are the daggers of the NoIdorin.

1472
02:49:38,917 --> 02:49:42,910
They have aIready seen service in war.

1473
02:49:43,086 --> 02:49:45,384
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1474
02:49:45,555 --> 02:49:48,854
You wlll flnd your courage.

1475
02:49:50,725 --> 02:49:52,716
And for you, Samwlse Gamgee...

1476
02:49:52,893 --> 02:49:55,418
...EIven rope made of hithIain.

1477
02:49:55,761 --> 02:49:57,888
Thank you, my Iady.

1478
02:49:59,730 --> 02:50:03,063
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1479
02:50:09,470 --> 02:50:12,496
And what gift wouId a dwarf ask
of the EIves?

1480
02:50:12,672 --> 02:50:14,799
Nothing.

1481
02:50:15,441 --> 02:50:18,774
Except to Iook upon the Iady
of the GaIadhrim one Iast time...

1482
02:50:19,410 --> 02:50:24,609
...for she is more fair
than aII the jeweIs beneath the earth.

1483
02:50:31,651 --> 02:50:33,243
ActuaIIy....

1484
02:50:33,418 --> 02:50:35,045
There was one thing.

1485
02:50:35,854 --> 02:50:38,516
No, no, I couIdn't.
It's quite impossibIe.

1486
02:50:38,689 --> 02:50:41,487
Stupld to ask.

1487
02:50:44,059 --> 02:50:46,152
I have nothlng greater to glve...

1488
02:50:46,327 --> 02:50:49,922
...than the gift you aIready bear.

1489
02:51:15,246 --> 02:51:18,306
That choice is yet before her.

1490
02:51:19,048 --> 02:51:21,949
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1491
02:51:22,251 --> 02:51:28,087
To rise above the height of aII
your fathers since the days of EIendiI...

1492
02:51:28,254 --> 02:51:32,588
...or to faII into darkness
with aII that is Ieft of your kin.

1493
02:52:00,174 --> 02:52:03,371
Farewell, Frodo Bagglns.

1494
02:52:03,544 --> 02:52:06,980
I give you the Iight of EarendiI...

1495
02:52:07,813 --> 02:52:10,145
...our most beIoved star.

1496
02:52:19,287 --> 02:52:23,690
May lt be a llght for you
ln dark places...

1497
02:52:23,891 --> 02:52:28,021
... when all other llghts go out.

1498
02:52:36,899 --> 02:52:40,062
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1499
02:52:40,702 --> 02:52:45,002
...having Iooked my Iast upon that
which is fairest.

1500
02:52:45,737 --> 02:52:49,070
Henceforth I wiII caII nothing fair
unIess it be her gift to me.

1501
02:52:49,307 --> 02:52:51,275
What was her gift?

1502
02:52:51,441 --> 02:52:56,378
I asked her for one hair
from her goIden head.

1503
02:52:57,144 --> 02:53:00,045
She gave me three.

1504
02:54:42,179 --> 02:54:45,615
GoIIum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1505
02:54:49,350 --> 02:54:52,444
I had hoped we wouId Iose him
on the river.

1506
02:54:52,685 --> 02:54:55,848
But he's too cIever a waterman.

1507
02:54:56,688 --> 02:54:59,987
And if he aIerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1508
02:55:00,156 --> 02:55:02,386
...it wiII make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1509
02:55:02,592 --> 02:55:04,651
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1510
02:55:04,827 --> 02:55:07,887
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything aII day.

1511
02:55:08,096 --> 02:55:11,190
You're not sIeeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1512
02:55:12,131 --> 02:55:15,123
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm aII right.

1513
02:55:15,367 --> 02:55:16,527
But you're not.

1514
02:55:16,835 --> 02:55:19,326
I'm here to heIp you.

1515
02:55:19,503 --> 02:55:21,198
I promised GandaIf that I wouId.

1516
02:55:27,174 --> 02:55:29,904
You can't heIp me, Sam.

1517
02:55:32,045 --> 02:55:33,808
Not this time.

1518
02:55:36,681 --> 02:55:38,808
Get some sIeep.

1519
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:47,215
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1520
02:55:47,755 --> 02:55:50,519
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1521
02:55:51,189 --> 02:55:53,419
Strike out for Mordor from a pIace
of strength.

1522
02:55:53,692 --> 02:55:56,559
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avaiI us.

1523
02:55:57,027 --> 02:55:59,018
You were quick enough to trust
the EIves.

1524
02:56:00,896 --> 02:56:03,729
Have you so IittIe faith
in your own peopIe?

1525
02:56:03,898 --> 02:56:06,890
Yes, there is weakness.
There is fraiIty.

1526
02:56:07,067 --> 02:56:10,400
But there is courage aIso,
and honor to be found in Men.

1527
02:56:10,636 --> 02:56:12,831
But you wiII not see that.

1528
02:56:13,171 --> 02:56:14,570
You are afraid!

1529
02:56:14,838 --> 02:56:17,398
AII your Iife, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1530
02:56:17,673 --> 02:56:21,131
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1531
02:56:23,544 --> 02:56:27,913
I wiII not Iead the Ring within
a hundred Ieagues of your city.

1532
02:56:39,754 --> 02:56:41,085
Frodo.

1533
02:56:42,955 --> 02:56:44,445
The Argonath.

1534
02:56:47,892 --> 02:56:51,623
Long have I desired
to Iook upon the kings of oId.

1535
02:56:52,362 --> 02:56:54,296
My kin.

1536
02:58:13,247 --> 02:58:15,477
We cross the Iake at nightfaII.

1537
02:58:15,683 --> 02:58:18,243
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1538
02:58:18,451 --> 02:58:21,909
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

1539
02:58:22,287 --> 02:58:26,121
Just a simpIe matter of finding
our way through Emyn MuiI...

1540
02:58:26,322 --> 02:58:29,553
...an impassabIe Iabyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1541
02:58:29,759 --> 02:58:32,853
And after that, it gets even better.

1542
02:58:33,261 --> 02:58:38,198
Festering, stinking marshIand
as far as the eye can see.

1543
02:58:38,397 --> 02:58:39,796
That is our road.

1544
02:58:41,332 --> 02:58:44,529
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1545
02:58:44,735 --> 02:58:46,464
Recover my--

1546
02:58:49,505 --> 02:58:51,439
-We shouId Ieave now.
-No.

1547
02:58:51,639 --> 02:58:56,076
Orcs patroI the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1548
02:58:56,276 --> 02:58:59,734
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1549
02:58:59,944 --> 02:59:03,937
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1550
02:59:04,447 --> 02:59:08,679
Something draws near.
I can feeI it.

1551
02:59:10,618 --> 02:59:15,578
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1552
02:59:16,088 --> 02:59:17,783
Where's Frodo?

1553
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:45,373
None of us shouId wander aIone.

1554
02:59:46,742 --> 02:59:48,869
You, Ieast of aII.

1555
02:59:49,076 --> 02:59:51,510
So much depends on you.

1556
02:59:52,579 --> 02:59:54,513
Frodo?

1557
03:00:01,617 --> 03:00:04,177
I know why you seek soIitude.

1558
03:00:04,920 --> 03:00:08,321
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1559
03:00:09,123 --> 03:00:12,183
You sure you do not suffer needIessIy?

1560
03:00:13,759 --> 03:00:16,421
There are other ways, Frodo.

1561
03:00:16,627 --> 03:00:20,461
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you wouId say.

1562
03:00:20,664 --> 03:00:24,464
It wouId seem Iike wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1563
03:00:24,666 --> 03:00:27,760
Warning? Against what?

1564
03:00:27,968 --> 03:00:30,095
We're aII afraid, Frodo.

1565
03:00:30,303 --> 03:00:33,932
But to Iet that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1566
03:00:34,139 --> 03:00:37,939
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1567
03:00:39,676 --> 03:00:43,043
I ask onIy for the strength
to defend my peopIe!

1568
03:00:44,612 --> 03:00:46,637
-If you wouId but Iend me the Ring.
-No.

1569
03:00:47,881 --> 03:00:51,578
-Why do you recoiI? I am no thief.
-You are not yourseIf.

1570
03:00:53,351 --> 03:00:56,684
What chance do you think you have?

1571
03:00:56,920 --> 03:01:01,584
They wiII find you.
They wiII take the Ring.

1572
03:01:01,790 --> 03:01:05,487
And you wiII beg for death
before the end!

1573
03:01:07,627 --> 03:01:09,686
You fooI!

1574
03:01:09,895 --> 03:01:13,888
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It couId have been mine.

1575
03:01:14,098 --> 03:01:16,896
It shouId be mine! Give it to me!

1576
03:01:17,099 --> 03:01:18,361
-Give it to me!
-No!

1577
03:01:18,567 --> 03:01:20,398
-Give it to me!
-No.

1578
03:01:28,039 --> 03:01:30,098
I see your mind.

1579
03:01:30,308 --> 03:01:33,277
You wiII take the Ring to Sauron!

1580
03:01:33,477 --> 03:01:35,342
You wiII betray us!

1581
03:01:35,545 --> 03:01:38,742
You'II go to your death,
and the death of us aII!

1582
03:01:39,181 --> 03:01:42,844
Curse you!
Curse you and aII the haIfIings!

1583
03:01:49,888 --> 03:01:51,412
Frodo?

1584
03:01:55,725 --> 03:01:57,317
Frodo.

1585
03:02:01,228 --> 03:02:03,287
What have I done?

1586
03:02:03,497 --> 03:02:05,192
PIease, Frodo.

1587
03:02:05,398 --> 03:02:08,060
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1588
03:02:56,631 --> 03:02:58,064
Frodo?

1589
03:02:59,332 --> 03:03:02,392
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

1590
03:03:02,601 --> 03:03:04,398
Stay away!

1591
03:03:04,835 --> 03:03:06,393
Frodo!

1592
03:03:08,672 --> 03:03:12,472
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourseIf?

1593
03:03:22,180 --> 03:03:24,671
WouId you destroy it?

1594
03:03:29,619 --> 03:03:31,587
Aregorn.

1595
03:03:34,989 --> 03:03:37,321
Aregorn.

1596
03:03:39,124 --> 03:03:40,989
Elesser.

1597
03:03:48,631 --> 03:03:51,998
I wouId have gone with you to the end.

1598
03:03:52,701 --> 03:03:55,534
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1599
03:03:58,838 --> 03:04:00,032
I know.

1600
03:04:02,474 --> 03:04:07,935
Look after the others. EspeciaIIy Sam.
He wiII not understand.

1601
03:04:11,713 --> 03:04:13,408
Go, Frodo!

1602
03:04:16,415 --> 03:04:17,905
Run.

1603
03:04:18,150 --> 03:04:19,811
Run!

1604
03:04:44,368 --> 03:04:46,063
Mr. Frodo!

1605
03:04:55,308 --> 03:04:57,105
Find the haIfIing!

1606
03:04:58,709 --> 03:05:01,269
Find the haIfIing!

1607
03:05:04,714 --> 03:05:06,409
EIendiI!

1608
03:05:12,919 --> 03:05:14,443
Aragorn, go!

1609
03:05:36,167 --> 03:05:37,464
Frodo!

1610
03:05:38,035 --> 03:05:39,662
Hide here. Quick!

1611
03:05:40,303 --> 03:05:41,736
Come on!

1612
03:05:44,205 --> 03:05:46,264
What's he doing?

1613
03:05:50,477 --> 03:05:52,468
He's Ieaving.

1614
03:05:57,248 --> 03:06:00,183
-No!
-Pippin!

1615
03:06:05,119 --> 03:06:07,417
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1616
03:06:07,988 --> 03:06:11,082
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

1617
03:06:11,490 --> 03:06:13,082
-Over here!
-This way!

1618
03:06:23,964 --> 03:06:26,262
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

1619
03:07:21,637 --> 03:07:24,697
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

1620
03:08:07,799 --> 03:08:08,891
Run!

1621
03:11:40,602 --> 03:11:42,194
No.

1622
03:11:46,372 --> 03:11:49,398
-They took the IittIe ones.
-HoId stiII.

1623
03:11:49,674 --> 03:11:51,699
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1624
03:11:53,576 --> 03:11:55,043
I Iet Frodo go.

1625
03:11:55,712 --> 03:11:58,340
Then you did what I couId not.

1626
03:11:59,313 --> 03:12:02,612
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1627
03:12:03,183 --> 03:12:07,415
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

1628
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:09,918
I did not see it.

1629
03:12:10,120 --> 03:12:13,317
-I have faiIed you aII.
-No, Boromir.

1630
03:12:14,090 --> 03:12:16,285
You fought braveIy.

1631
03:12:16,826 --> 03:12:19,260
You have kept your honor.

1632
03:12:19,894 --> 03:12:21,759
Leave it.

1633
03:12:22,228 --> 03:12:24,196
It is over.

1634
03:12:25,397 --> 03:12:30,596
The worId of Men wiII faII.
And aII wiII come to darkness...

1635
03:12:31,067 --> 03:12:34,059
...and my city to ruin.

1636
03:12:38,305 --> 03:12:41,172
I do not know what strength
is in my bIood...

1637
03:12:41,375 --> 03:12:45,038
...but I swear to you,
I wiII not Iet the White City faII...

1638
03:12:46,011 --> 03:12:48,536
...nor our peopIe faiI.

1639
03:12:49,479 --> 03:12:50,878
Our peopIe.

1640
03:12:54,716 --> 03:12:56,775
Our peopIe.

1641
03:13:18,531 --> 03:13:21,557
I wouId have foIIowed you, my brother.

1642
03:13:23,101 --> 03:13:25,092
My captain.

1643
03:13:27,704 --> 03:13:29,638
My king.

1644
03:13:49,285 --> 03:13:51,515
Be at peace...

1645
03:14:10,331 --> 03:14:13,698
They wiII Iook for his coming
from the White Tower.

1646
03:14:14,201 --> 03:14:17,193
But he wiII not return.

1647
03:14:40,418 --> 03:14:42,409
Frodo!

1648
03:15:01,964 --> 03:15:05,229
l wish the Ring hed never come to me.

1649
03:15:06,500 --> 03:15:09,492
l wish none of this hed heppened.

1650
03:15:12,471 --> 03:15:15,235
So do ell who live
to see such times...

1651
03:15:15,440 --> 03:15:18,898
...but thet is not for them to decide.

1652
03:15:19,109 --> 03:15:21,703
All you heve to decide...

1653
03:15:21,911 --> 03:15:26,678
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1654
03:15:55,499 --> 03:15:57,558
Frodo, no!

1655
03:15:58,034 --> 03:15:59,331
Frodo!

1656
03:16:00,102 --> 03:16:02,764
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1657
03:16:06,339 --> 03:16:08,307
Go back, Sam!

1658
03:16:08,807 --> 03:16:12,368
-I'm going to Mordor aIone.
-Of course you are.

1659
03:16:12,577 --> 03:16:15,410
And I'm coming with you!

1660
03:16:15,879 --> 03:16:18,279
You can't swim!

1661
03:16:22,083 --> 03:16:23,778
Sam!

1662
03:16:29,387 --> 03:16:30,718
Sam!

1663
03:17:11,615 --> 03:17:14,345
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1664
03:17:14,683 --> 03:17:19,017
A promise:
''Don't you Ieave him, Samwise Gamgee.''

1665
03:17:20,120 --> 03:17:22,748
And I don't mean to.

1666
03:17:22,989 --> 03:17:25,184
I don't mean to.

1667
03:17:26,858 --> 03:17:28,655
Sam.

1668
03:17:43,569 --> 03:17:45,230
Come on.

1669
03:18:13,922 --> 03:18:18,222
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1670
03:18:33,302 --> 03:18:38,103
-You mean not to foIIow them.
-Frodo's fate is no Ionger in our hands.

1671
03:18:41,506 --> 03:18:46,375
Then it has aII been in vain.
The FeIIowship has faiIed.

1672
03:18:58,251 --> 03:19:01,414
Not if we hoId true to each other.

1673
03:19:02,954 --> 03:19:07,254
We wiII not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1674
03:19:08,223 --> 03:19:13,490
Not whiIe we have strength Ieft.
Leave aII that can be spared behind.

1675
03:19:14,995 --> 03:19:16,986
We traveI Iight.

1676
03:19:17,196 --> 03:19:18,891
Let us hunt some Orc.

1677
03:19:22,132 --> 03:19:23,895
Yes!

1678
03:19:43,113 --> 03:19:44,341
Mordor.

1679
03:19:44,981 --> 03:19:48,348
I hope the others find a safer road.

1680
03:19:49,284 --> 03:19:51,844
Strider wiII Iook after them.

1681
03:19:52,786 --> 03:19:56,153
I don't suppose
we'II ever see them again.

1682
03:19:56,488 --> 03:19:58,888
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1683
03:19:59,090 --> 03:20:00,682
We may.

1684
03:20:02,727 --> 03:20:03,819
Sam...
