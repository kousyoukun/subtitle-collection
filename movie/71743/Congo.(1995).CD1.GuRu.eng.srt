1
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,766
Dr Ross, we've got satellite
from the Congo.

2
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:55,853
It won't work. The old man's got me
changing the code every three hours.

3
00:02:56,024 --> 00:03:00,016
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.
- Very inventive.

4
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:05,420
- We should have a visual momentarily.
- They said they found it.

5
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:09,994
Seven volcanoes, and he picks the
right one. His luck's finally changed.

6
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,732
- Karen.
- I read you, Charles. And I see you.

7
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:18,789
Well, eureka and all that.
I found the bloody thing.

8
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,529
- What was that?
- The whole place does the shimmy.

9
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:28,230
- How's the volcano?
- Acting very much like a volcano.

10
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:33,576
- I wouldn't build condominiums.
- Charles, did you really find it?

11
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:38,688
Chemically flawless,
blue diamond alluvia.

12
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:43,643
Johnny-on-the-spot phasic laser.

13
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:46,943
This will look kind of raw
without a real diamond.

14
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:01,724
- That test came back positive.
- Oh, my God.

15
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:06,386
We found the sand in a mineral stream.
Jeffrey's searching for the source.

16
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:10,897
- I'll get Travis.
- Wait. Jeffrey should share the glory.

17
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:15,985
- Let's link up again in one hour.
- Great. Give me your coordinates.

18
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,507
Charles...?

19
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,217
- Jeffrey...
- Charlie, over here.

20
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:33,261
Charlie, I think this
may really be something.

21
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,945
- We haven't got much time.
- I'll show you.

22
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,309
Jump in.

23
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,555
- What?
- I'll go first.

24
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,433
Jeffrey!

25
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,840
Jeffrey!

26
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,521
- What is this?
- Come on.

27
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:20,126
From below it just looks like jungle,
but it's not just jungle. See?

28
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,075
Jesus Christ.

29
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:27,163
This is a big deal.
This is a big find.

30
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:33,018
I can't believe it. All these centuries,
just sitting here, waiting for lucky us.

31
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:41,653
Listen, I raised Houston,
they're getting the old man.

32
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:44,498
Come share the glory.

33
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:48,751
- We'll have to get another team here.
- Let me grab my bag.

34
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:04,234
- Perfect? A flawless diamond?
- He found it. He was right.

35
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:08,803
With the right laser and diamonds, we'll
take over the communications industry.

36
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:15,013
Charles says a laser with a diamond
like that can punch a hole in the moon.

37
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,418
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey!

38
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:32,506
Come on, we're supposed to transmit
in ten minutes.

39
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,958
Now you're throwing stuff at me?

40
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:05,516
- Where is he?
- I don't know. They're ten minutes late.

41
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:08,078
Activate the remote.

42
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,656
- I guess he's still looking for Jeffrey.
- Pan the camera.

43
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:27,876
What in God's name...?

44
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,071
Lock your remote. Back scan.
Give me thermal readout.

45
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,980
- I can see seven dead people.
- What's that sound?

46
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:05,496
I didn't see him.
Charles!

47
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,850
- I'll get help.
- I had the code changed.

48
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,986
Well, what is it?

49
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:13,845
Rudy?

50
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,727
- Sir?
- Use the fire extinguisher on that.

51
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,831
- What's the code, sir?
- Do what I say!

52
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:29,645
- No one knows this happened but us.
- Families must be notified. Your wife.

53
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:33,455
We don't know he's dead.
If it's reported, they'll close the border.

54
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:40,524
- What was that thing? A gorilla?
- Baboon. Gorillas don't do that.

55
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:44,516
- It could have been a rival company.
- Not another paranoid fantasy.

56
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:49,257
I need those diamonds, Dr Ross!
It's the future.

57
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:55,082
- Most believe children are the future.
- 40,000 people are depending on me.

58
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,960
This satellite is our cash cow.

59
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:03,270
In three years it'll be obsolete. I need
a new cash machine. This diamond's it!

60
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:08,351
- Charles knew it. That's why he went.
- He went into the Congo to please you.

61
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:14,232
- I know you had feelings for him.
- I almost married him.

62
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:19,158
You have to go down there, Dr Ross.
You're good in the field.

63
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:22,198
The laser's power pack
should give off a readable signal.

64
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:26,906
- Take over an existing expedition.
- What are you talking about?

65
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:32,251
There's no time! Once we let out what's
happened, Zaire will shut the border.

66
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:38,968
- Are you human?
- I'll be human later. I'll get good people.

67
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,304
- Find out what happened to Charles.
- Say it's because you love your son.

68
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,325
It is.

69
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:51,983
Okay. But if I have one moment when
I think otherwise, I'll make you sorry.

70
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:53,642
That's a promise.

71
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:06,989
Oakland's number one classic station,
taking you back in time, all the time.

72
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:14,021
Isn't that beautiful?
What's Amy's favourite colour?

73
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:19,903
Green, that's right.
How green was my valley... Drop that!

74
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:23,934
Good. Pretty. So pretty.

75
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:29,186
No, Amy, on the paper.
Good.

76
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,804
Amy, get some more paint.

77
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,805
Good. That's green.

78
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:39,614
No, Amy, on the paper.

79
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,638
Good girl. Such a pretty girl.

80
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:45,978
That's your lovey.

81
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,195
Amy! Hey, you!

82
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,160
- How did she sleep?
- Great. No nightmares.

83
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,684
That's my Amy.

84
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:06,704
Richard, you better clean her up.
It's showtime.

85
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:14,607
Communication is what separated
human from animal. Speech.

86
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:21,389
And for those who couldn't speak,
sign language. An alphabet in gestures.

87
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:24,781
Then came virtual reality.

88
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:30,441
Sensors worn like clothing could read
and replicate the body's movements.

89
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:37,030
Arliss Wender at MIT was the first to
apply this technology to sign language.

90
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:41,863
Our subject, William,
was born without the organs of speech.

91
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:44,894
Isn't that right, William?

92
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:48,804
That is absolutely right.

93
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:59,386
This is the fiirst time
I have ever heard my own voice.

94
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:07,574
Lights, please.
It's hard to get grants for what I do.

95
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:13,938
Most people just don't believe it.
They think it's a parlour trick. A gag.

96
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,147
But it's no gag.

97
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:23,154
This technology lets me demonstrate
what has never been demonstrated.

98
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,881
Animals can talk.

99
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:29,038
Amy, could you come down
here please?

100
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,957
Hello, Amy. Thank you for the flowers.

101
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:48,429
Hello, Peter.

102
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:54,759
Amy, how old are you?

103
00:12:54,924 --> 00:13:00,105
Amy seven.
Amy good gorilla.

104
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:04,194
- Amy pretty.
- Yes, you are.

105
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:08,254
This is a talking gorilla, Moira.
This gorilla is talking!

106
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:11,237
- I know.
- This is really happening.

107
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:15,520
- This isn't Mr Ed.
- I know it's not Mr Ed.

108
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,686
Amy, look at me.

109
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:23,999
- Amy mother.
- That's right. That's your baby.

110
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:28,251
- Amy wants lunch.
- Okay.

111
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:33,563
- What do you think, Mrs Romy?
- It's spooky. Very spooky.

112
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:38,579
Amy's above average intelligence
for a gorilla, but she's not a freak.

113
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:45,620
What she has learned, other gorillas
can learn. But it takes money.

114
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:09,417
Amy, calm down. Easy.
It's okay. You're all right.

115
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:16,908
- You've got her sedated. She'll be fine.
- She won't be fine. Nightmares again.

116
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:21,922
Captive gorillas can degenerate
mentally, having to be destroyed.

117
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,253
When she did these paintings
she got better. Why?

118
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:33,887
Hey, hey...
What's this room starting to look like?

119
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:40,160
She's been painting the jungle!
She wants to go home.

120
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:45,918
Peter, you did a great job.
You taught a gorilla to talk, to paint.

121
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:50,585
You can get a grant for anything
except setting her free.

122
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:54,198
I taught her, now she can teach
the mountain gorillas.

123
00:14:54,365 --> 00:15:00,440
- We'll translate other animals' speech.
- Oh, please. Making you Dr Doolittle?

124
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:05,239
No foundation would fund
an expedition with that objective.

125
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:07,310
I will pay.

126
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,857
- I will pay for Amy to go home.
- And who are you?

127
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:17,485
Herkermer Homolka. Romanian. Free
now of the chains of Ceaucescu.

128
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:20,651
Travelling the world, doing good.

129
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:28,971
- A Romanian philanthropist?
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

130
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,299
We're taking Amy home. Get packed.

131
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:38,146
Do you know where we're going?
Amy, where are we going?

132
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:41,795
- Jungle. Mejungle.
- She's really excited.

133
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:45,540
- Are you excited?
- Me? I'm terrified.

134
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:49,959
Safari? I don't even like picnics.
Nice glasses.

135
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:55,908
- That's right. Jungle. Home.
- Tickle me.

136
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:58,911
Time to go.

137
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:10,330
Someone looking for me?

138
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:16,691
Herkermer Homolka, hello.
The transport.

139
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:22,520
- Is there a problem?
- Not unless there's a problem.

140
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:30,931
Are you excited? That's a camera.
Be careful, it's expensive.

141
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:33,964
I think she's got a real eye.

142
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:39,796
- Professor Karen Ross.
- Professor Peter Elliot.

143
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:44,683
Have you got my faxes,
Fed Exes and phone calls?

144
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:51,950
- It's a hastily put together expedition.
- To the Congo, with a talking gorilla.

145
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:59,331
- I need to join up with you.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

146
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:04,866
- This is ready to load on the plane.
- We're taking this stuff off the plane.

147
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:07,750
- I can pay part of the cost.
- They're taking stuff off the plane?

148
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:13,181
- I'm sorry, we don't need any money.
- You can easily find room for me.

149
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:19,459
It's not a matter of that. It's Amy.
She gets jealous very easily.

150
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,335
- Why are you unloading the plane?
- Talk to the operations guy.

151
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:30,393
I have to be on your manifest, or my
visas are worthless. Name your price.

152
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:36,887
- I have none. I'm not a pound of sugar.
- Don't be hasty, Dr Elliot.

153
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:40,827
Herkermer Homolka,
formerly of Romania.

154
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:46,420
There seems to be some glitch.
They're unloading the plane.

155
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:50,839
Unfortunately there has been
a slight interruption in my credit flow.

156
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,479
- I am unable to pay for the fuel.
- I'll pay for it.

157
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:58,769
- I'll pay for it. How much is it?
- $56,000.

158
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:00,242
56,000?

159
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:03,370
What are you smiling about?

160
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,321
You need me, Dr Elliot.

161
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:18,532
We've been cleared for take-off.

162
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:22,562
Please make sure
that your seat belts are fastened.

163
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:28,447
- We're returning her to the jungle.
- Not a moment too soon.

164
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:32,358
- You're the reason she's upset.
- Me? What did I do?

165
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,228
- Ugly woman.
- Yes. Now let's get your seat belt on.

166
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,967
Forgive me. I'll explain later.
See? I'm buckling my seat belt.

167
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:44,703
- We're all buckling our seat belts.
- You can do it.

168
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:50,839
That's it.
Good girl. Here's an egg.

169
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:56,283
- We do not throw things.
- Is she dangerous?

170
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:59,315
Humans are dangerous,
gorillas are gentle.

171
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:04,185
You think the gorilla
may be dangerous? Maybe so.

172
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:09,486
Don't perpetuate the King Kong myth,
the myth of the killer ape.

173
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:14,773
- Are you sure some gorillas don't kill?
- You can't be serious.

174
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:17,356
What's your area of expertise,
folk singing?

175
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:23,181
- Communications technology.
- A geek with a cell phone.

176
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:28,081
I'm a scientist. But you
and your prot Ág Á belong in the circus.

177
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:39,691
Just because you came up with
a wad of cash... It's okay, Amy.

178
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:44,424
- Where ground?
- It's fine. We're flying.

179
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:50,336
- We're going to the jungle.
- Amy want green drop drink.

180
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,954
Amy want green drop drink.

181
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,974
All right.

182
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:59,423
You'd swear they were married.

183
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,217
The "killer ape" is politically incorrect,
but that's not to say it's untrue.

184
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:11,608
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Cliches usually contain some truth.

185
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:22,812
- Are you serving that ape a martini?
- She's allowed one. It'll calm her down.

186
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:27,633
In my life I have heard
many a bizarre story -

187
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:32,405
- containing bizarre truth.

188
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:11,905
- I'm sorry I called you ugly. If I didn't...
- I know, it was for Amy's benefit.

189
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:15,556
Can I ask you something?

190
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,883
Why teach an ape to talk?

191
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:24,642
Why teach anything to anyone? It
doesn't make you rich or get you girls.

192
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,925
Why did Prometheus steal fire
only to give it away?

193
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:34,239
One face of the inherent generosity
in the human spirit is the teacher.

194
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:39,924
I repeat, why teach an ape to talk?

195
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:42,679
- No practical reason.
- Then why did you do it?

196
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:47,386
"A Ionely impulse of delight."

197
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:51,218
- William Butler Yeats.
- Very good.

198
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:56,466
Did it work?
You're not Ionely anymore?

199
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:01,268
Why are you going to Africa?

200
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,314
To find something I lost.

201
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,830
- Watch your step.
- Dr Ross!

202
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,166
Eddie Ventro. Mr Travis asked me to
meet the plane, set up your expedition.

203
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:47,325
- Hers? She's just along for the ride.
- Whatever. Be an asshole.

204
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:51,898
- Who is this guy?
- Ventro, transportation and equipment.

205
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:57,465
But I don't supply assholes with new
personalities. Let's see your new plane.

206
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,764
You want to sell that gorilla?
It's worth a lot of money.

207
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:10,259
- How much? I'm just curious.
- 20-25 grand for a female.

208
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:15,823
- Amy want to go home.
- I'm taking you home.

209
00:23:15,992 --> 00:23:21,424
Whoa, a talking gorilla! I can feel the
money hairs on the back of my neck.

210
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:26,924
Mr Travis told me to load you up.
You know how to use all this stuff?

211
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:30,670
- Do you really need a balloon?
- No, let me see that.

212
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:33,895
- Who are they?
- Hi, fellas!

213
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,186
The fuck if I know. We're on
our third government in two years.

214
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:42,606
- So you're our guide?
- No, you've got Monroe Kelly.

215
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:45,929
- Is he good?
- Very good, and very late.

216
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:52,937
Now what? Why do I feel like
this airport's just gone to shit?

217
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,299
- Give me your passports.
- Our guide is Robertson Reynolds.

218
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,509
Yeah, I fired him.
Robertson Reynolds is a bird-watcher.

219
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:19,546
The Kigani have had it with Zaire
and they're eating people.

220
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,769
You go in with Reynolds, you come out
somebody's bowel movement.

221
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:26,137
Wasn't that easier than customs?

222
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,412
Monroe...

223
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:35,121
We need to switch airports.
Bomb in the president's car.

224
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:40,306
- It was his car? Did they get him?
- That's the bad news. No, they didn't.

225
00:24:40,472 --> 00:24:42,707
- I hope you folks have lots of money.
- We do.

226
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:54,701
Thank you. Now run away...

227
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:59,752
Get in the back. Leave the equipment
to Eddie. I would hurry.

228
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,847
- Is this normal?
- You're on your own, Eddie.

229
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:12,672
- Where do you want me to set you up?
- Get a DC-3. The strip near Kegoma.

230
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:17,348
First the Kigani in Zaire, now this
godfather stuff. Not a good day.

231
00:25:17,513 --> 00:25:19,999
- Lower the flaps.
- Good luck!

232
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:44,220
I'm getting out of here.

233
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:56,665
- What's going on?
- Are we safe?

234
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,559
It's all right, just a few bumps.

235
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,315
Amy, leave that man alone.

236
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,026
Amy, don't inhale.

237
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:22,854
Karen Ross? Monroe Kelly.
I'm your great white hunter for this trip.

238
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:27,528
- Though I happen to be black.
- How bad is this news for us?

239
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:34,085
Whenever leadership comes into
question, they tend to murder everyone.

240
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:38,527
- Oh, my God!
- They live to settle scores.

241
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:43,005
And they've got a lot of scores to settle.
It's like in the Congo.

242
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:48,956
Things are pretty bad in the Congo.
The Kigani are pissed off.

243
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:54,208
Can't blame them. The 20th century
sucks. Maybe the 21st will be better.

244
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:57,599
- Are you a criminal?
- Aren't we all?

245
00:26:57,762 --> 00:27:01,503
I'm not a criminal, I'm a scientist.

246
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:05,591
I run a few guns, you sons of bitches
ruin the world.

247
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:12,631
- We shouldn't be involved with them.
- What would you suggest?

248
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:17,551
As soon as we can,
we should go our own way.

249
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:18,965
Don't I know you?

250
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,607
Perhaps. I travel a great deal.

251
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:29,098
- What are you doing with that gorilla?
- Taking her back home to the Congo.

252
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:34,003
Taking her back to the farm
now that she's seen Paree?

253
00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:41,068
And this is your cover?
Pretty good. Or, it would have been.

254
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:45,322
- I'm nobody's cover.
- You find yourself in the middle.

255
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:48,236
- Cover for what?
- I don't know, and she won't tell you.

256
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,771
But the money her company
is throwing around isn't for a gorilla.

257
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:59,267
Relax. You're in better hands
than you should be.

258
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,453
No one can go to Zaire.
The border is shut. There is a revolt.

259
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:46,892
- It's not my fault. Where's my gorilla?
- She'll be kept on the truck...

260
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:50,890
- Isn't this a hospital?
- This one's decided to speak.

261
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:54,093
- This is pure Kafka.
- Who is Kafka? Tell me!

262
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:08,839
- Monroe.
- Captain Wanta.

263
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:13,892
How are you?
Miss Ross, such a pleasure.

264
00:29:16,587 --> 00:29:19,521
Have some coffee and cake.

265
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:24,391
Have some!

266
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:30,716
You have our visas. This is a scientific
mission. You have no right to detain us.

267
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:33,699
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

268
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:38,044
So says my computer, Miss Ross.

269
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:45,948
You used to work for the CIA.
Now you're TraviCom.

270
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:49,787
- They pay better?
- You have a big mouth.

271
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,723
Everybody says that about me.
What can I do?

272
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:58,420
- Monroe, you have terrible timing.
- Tell me about it.

273
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:05,359
They blew up the president's Mercedes.
Our country will be in shit for a year.

274
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:10,709
- Captain, I need that truck.
- And ten good men to the border.

275
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,453
More.

276
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:36,836
Mr Homolka?

277
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:41,345
Stop eating my sesame cake.

278
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:47,013
Stop eating my sesame cake!

279
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,036
What are you doing in my country,
you bag of shit?

280
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:59,610
Captain, please.
I only wish to explore and discover.

281
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:05,657
This fellow is a big bag of shit.

282
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:11,452
Shake this rat from off your neck.
He owes money to everybody.

283
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:13,882
I will ask you to wait outside.

284
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,764
I like that, Miss Ross. You surprise him.

285
00:31:30,774 --> 00:31:34,068
So, I put this away.

286
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,540
Don't want nobody peeking.

287
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:49,605
It's the gorilla that will get you
across the border safely.

288
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:54,824
Everyone's afraid of being seen in an
American movie being cruel to gorillas.

289
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:59,810
This is the crazy world we live in.
Okay, you can go.

290
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,474
Hit the road, as they say.
And have a nice day.

291
00:32:22,178 --> 00:32:26,039
Are you all right?
Admit it, you're glad to see me.

292
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:15,843
- Kahega!
- Monroe!

293
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:19,979
Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy.

294
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,659
- Are we in Zaire?
- Tanzania.

295
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:45,015
Stay close to me.
Amy, come on.

296
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,392
- I think this is at my expense.
- You're right.

297
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:08,754
- When will we get to the rainforest?
- Herkermer Homolka, right?

298
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,531
You're not looking for
Solomon's city again, are you?

299
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,898
Mr Homolka was part of
a disastrous expedition five years ago.

300
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,605
They were looking for a city
called Zinj, but it doesn't exist.

301
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:27,625
- It does exist!
- Three members died from exposure.

302
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:33,225
- A fourth was somehow shot.
- It was an appalling suicide.

303
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:37,350
Mr Homolka had to be
carried out of the jungle by me.

304
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:44,356
- I knew he wasn't a philanthropist.
- He has done good, mostly for himself.

305
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:47,718
- Shut up, you filthy...
- Filthy what?

306
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:57,116
Forgive me. All that travelling
has left me... shaken.

307
00:34:57,733 --> 00:35:00,481
Think nothing of it.
All aboard!

308
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:11,733
- What's all this stuff?
- Courtesy of Eddie Ventro.

309
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:16,724
A customs guy hit me in the head with
a can of peanut oil for stamping visas.

310
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:20,983
I'm never going back to that country.

311
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:27,605
You got everything but the balloon
and the home entertainment centre.

312
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,486
Your boss says "Call me".

313
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:37,422
You have 11 good guys, significant
firepower and significant technology.

314
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:39,214
Good luck.

315
00:35:39,381 --> 00:35:40,558
Bye, Monroe.

316
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:08,645
- May I?
- There's one thing I don't understand.

317
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:13,314
- If the border's shut, how do we cross?
- Luck.

318
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,438
- What's going on?
- What the hell is that?

319
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:44,599
Shit. I thought we'd get farther.
I'd put her out now.

320
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:50,063
- Who's firing on us?
- We're violating Zaire's airspace.

321
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:55,468
She likes bananas? Eat this, darling.
She's going to feel great.

322
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:59,216
Something to keep her calm.
Gorilla Prozac.

323
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:04,202
- Can we make it to Bondo?
- We're done.

324
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:20,678
- What are you doing?
- Step aside, please.

325
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,634
Miss Ross. Here.

326
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:14,935
- Why are they putting on parachutes?
- Figure it out.

327
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:30,764
- This won't work.
- I'll take Amy.

328
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:35,082
- She might get hurt. I can't risk it.
- You know how to fly this plane?

329
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:38,182
The pilot and co-pilot
are already gone.

330
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:56,989
Push me, please.

331
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:00,897
Harder, please.

332
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:23,478
You want me to push you too?

333
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,720
See you down there.

334
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:40,536
- Where's Amy?
- Sleeping. She woke up coming down.

335
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:45,851
- That lady has some set of teeth.
- We have to call this off.

336
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:49,841
- I'm not James Bond.
- I'll take care of you.

337
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,879
I don't want you to take care of me.

338
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:56,790
I'm taking a safari
into the Virunga region of the Congo.

339
00:40:56,984 --> 00:41:00,081
If you don't want to go, go wherever.

340
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:04,653
But this is a dangerous place,
and people die here very easily.

341
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:07,531
Now, excuse me.

342
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,497
Amy...?

343
00:41:33,002 --> 00:41:36,797
Such an extraordinary animal.

344
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:42,979
Those paintings. Do you think she was
drawing something from real life?

345
00:41:43,142 --> 00:41:47,133
- I think she was drawing home.
- What about those oval shapes?

346
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,096
- Just a shape she likes.
- Perhaps.

347
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:54,784
- Video game?
- It gives latitude and longitude.

348
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:59,766
- More than that, from the look of it.
- Well, it's a gadget. It has features.

349
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:04,571
- You found someone or something?
- A little bit of both.

350
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:08,888
- Why did you quit the CIA?
- I never worked for the CIA.

351
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:12,847
Of course not.
But if you had, why would you quit?

352
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:18,483
Because they're a loveless bunch
of sons of bitches, and I'm not.

353
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:19,989
Glad to hear it.

354
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:32,240
- Okay, here we go.
- Fabulous equipment.

355
00:42:32,402 --> 00:42:35,849
- I have air-conditioning, too.
- Air-conditioners?

356
00:42:36,018 --> 00:42:39,399
- I suppose it is a bit much.
- Shit, I'll take one.

357
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:51,489
Mr Homolka...

358
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:57,156
- Please, call me Herkermer.
- All right. You can call me Mr Kelly.

359
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:03,365
- I wonder what she's about.
- What do you mean?

360
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:09,438
What you're after, I've got figured.
What she's after, I don't know.

361
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:11,458
I'll get you!

362
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:17,345
I'm helping that young scientist
return his ward to the wild.

363
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:23,318
He says the ape may be able to tell us
the thoughts of the wild gorillas.

364
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:26,966
You're looking for King Solomon's
diamonds. The lost city of Zinj.

365
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:34,806
- I've given it up.
- Never. The problem is, it doesn't exist.

366
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,703
Solomon must have got his diamonds
from Cartier, like everybody else.

367
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:47,441
You like that, don't you?

368
00:43:50,068 --> 00:43:52,816
Time for Madam Amy's vitamins.

369
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:05,829
This is Karen Ross. 81452.
That is KR81452.

370
00:44:05,998 --> 00:44:12,422
Travis, do you read? Karen Ross,
81452. Houston, Travis, do you read?

371
00:44:12,588 --> 00:44:17,223
I read and see you. Congratulations
on crossing the border.

372
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,781
- I have a signal from the power pack.
- Good. Find the laser, you find Charles.

373
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:28,164
Let's hope so.
Tomorrow we enter the rainforest.

374
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:33,211
Karen, I've had those images
of the creature analysed.

375
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:44,638
- What is it?
- It's something new, but gorilla-like.

376
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:49,434
- Are you sufficiently armed?
- Yes.

377
00:44:49,597 --> 00:44:53,174
The bad news is geo-thermal.
You've got to hurry.

378
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,048
The region in the Virungas is bad.
The volcanic activity -

379
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:02,642
- is breaking out of the graph. It'll blow.
Could be a week, could be sooner...

380
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:08,394
- Watch out!
- No, dammit! Not again!

381
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:10,953
I'm terribly sorry.

382
00:45:14,355 --> 00:45:15,849
It's destroyed.

383
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:20,234
It's completely destroyed.

384
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:55,903
- What is that?
- Full moon. Colobus monkeys.

385
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:59,927
- That's monkeys?
- Mating season.

386
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:04,732
When there's a moon like that, every
monkey for 200 miles thinks he's Elvis.

387
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:00,356
It's Amy's medical supplies.
They can't get wet.

388
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:23,105
- Shit! Somebody help me.
- What is it?

389
00:48:23,273 --> 00:48:29,151
- There's a creature on my... Look.
- That's a leech.

390
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:32,350
- Take it off.
- It's your leech, you take it off.

391
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:36,825
- Need some help?
- Here, burn it off with this.

392
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,759
This is disgusting.

393
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:44,508
Thank you for your compassion.

394
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:53,241
Here.

395
00:49:00,986 --> 00:49:04,432
- Monroe...
- Don't indicate you see them.

396
00:49:05,688 --> 00:49:09,778
Mizumu. The ghost tribe.
There are probably 20 of them.

397
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:18,858
- I only see two. Are they friendly?
- They're sensitive. Forest people.

398
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:32,743
- Why are they laughing?
- I told them I was in charge.

399
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:36,802
- What's so funny about that?
- I'm black. I should carry luggage.

400
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:49,053
He says there's a dead white man
with a symbol on his clothes.

401
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:57,790
Did they say he's dead?

402
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:02,623
- What does 'TC" mean?
- TraviCom. The company I work for.

403
00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:08,381
They have many levels of "dead". You
aren't dead till you're completely dead.

404
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:49,292
They haven't moved him.
They believe his soul has left his body.

405
00:50:49,456 --> 00:50:55,433
If they move him, his soul will be lost.
They're asking his soul to come back.

406
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,221
Where is the man?

407
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:40,308
It's not him, it's Bob Driscoll.
What happened?

408
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:42,711
Bob?

409
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,958
- Who is this man?
- He was on TraviCom's last expedition.

410
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:53,997
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

411
00:51:55,765 --> 00:51:56,975
Bob...?

412
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:31,303
He's dead.
