1
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,827
<i>Dr. Ross, we've got satellite</i>
<i>from the Congo.</i>

2
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:57,583
- What did he say, Rudy?
- I can't repeat it here. It's Charles.

3
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,339
It won't work. The old man's got me
changing the code every three hours.

4
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:08,802
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.
- Very inventive.

5
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,600
- We should have a visual momentarily.
- They said they found it.

6
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,188
Seven volcanoes, and he picks the
right one. His luck's finally changed.

7
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,151
- <i>Karen.</i>
- I read you, Charles. And I see you.

8
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,364
<i>Well, eureka and all that.</i>
<i>I found the bloody thing.</i>

9
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:33,244
- What was that?
- <i>The whole place does the shimmy.</i>

10
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:38,124
- How's the volcano?
- <i>Acting very much like a volcano.</i>

11
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:43,796
- <i>I wouldn't build condominiums.</i>
- Charles, did you really find it?

12
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,260
<i>Chemically flawless,</i>
<i>blue diamond alluvia.</i>

13
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,307
<i>Johnny-on-the-spot phasic laser.</i>

14
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,603
<i>This will look kind of raw</i>
<i>without a real diamond.</i>

15
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:13,065
- <i>That test came back positive.</i>
- Oh, my God.

16
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:18,081
<i>We found the sand in a mineral stream.</i>
<i>Jeffrey's searching for the source.</i>

17
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,460
- I'll get Travis.
- <i>Wait. Jeffrey should share the glory.</i>

18
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:27,966
- <i>Let's link up again in one hour.</i>
- Great. Give me your coordinates.

19
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,262
Charles?

20
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,478
- Jeffrey...
- Charlie, over here.

21
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:46,151
Charlie, I think this
may really be something.

22
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,061
- We haven't got much time.
- I'll show you.

23
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,689
Jump in.

24
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:58,080
- What?
- I'll go first.

25
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,951
Jeffrey!

26
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,564
Jeffrey!

27
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:30,029
- What is this?
- Come on.

28
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:34,992
From below it just looks like jungle,
but it's not just jungle. See?

29
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,776
Jesus Christ.

30
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:42,291
This is a big deal.
This is a big find.

31
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:48,506
I can't believe it. All these centuries,
just sitting here, waiting for lucky us.

32
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,390
Listen, I raised Houston,
they're getting the old man.

33
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,476
Come share the glory.

34
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:04,898
- We'll have to get another team here.
- Let me grab my bag.

35
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:20,914
- Perfect? A flawless diamond?
- He found it. He was right.

36
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:27,744
With the right laser and diamonds, we'll
take over the communications industry.

37
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:33,468
Charles says a laser with a diamond
like that can punch a hole in the moon.

38
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,592
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey!

39
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:51,403
Come on, we're supposed to transmit
in ten minutes.

40
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:06,710
Now you're throwing stuff at me?

41
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:24,520
- Where is he?
- I don't know. They're ten minutes late.

42
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:27,732
Activate the remote.

43
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:39,566
- I guess he's still looking for Jeffrey.
- Pan the camera.

44
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,712
What in God's name?

45
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:59,889
Lock your remote. Back scan.
Give me thermal readout.

46
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:07,188
- I can see seven dead people.
- What's that sound?

47
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:27,167
I didn't see him.
Charles!

48
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:31,922
- I'll get help.
- I had the code changed.

49
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:35,217
Well, what is it? Rudy?

50
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:38,512
- Sir?
- Use the fire extinguisher on that.

51
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:43,058
- What's the code, sir?
- Do what I say!

52
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:52,568
- No one knows this happened but us.
- Families must be notified. Your wife.

53
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:56,561
We don't know he's dead.
If it's reported, they'll close the border.

54
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:03,235
- What was that thing? A gorilla?
- Baboon. Gorillas don't do that.

55
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:08,125
- It could have been a rival company.
- Not another paranoid fantasy.

56
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:13,297
I need those diamonds, Dr. Ross!
It's the future.

57
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:19,178
- Most believe children are the future.
- 40,000 people are depending on me.

58
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:22,097
This satellite is our cash cow.

59
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:27,655
In three years it'll be obsolete. I need
a new cash machine. This diamond's it!

60
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:33,015
- Charles knew it. That's why he went.
- He went into the Congo to please you.

61
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:38,739
- I know you had feelings for him.
- I almost <i>married</i> him.

62
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,160
You have to go down there, Dr. Ross.
You're good in the field.

63
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,498
The laser's power pack
should give off a readable signal.

64
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:52,462
- Take over an existing expedition.
- What are you talking about?

65
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:58,019
There's no time! Once we let out what's
happened, Zaire will shut the border.

66
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:04,891
- Are you human?
- I'll be human later. I'll get good people.

67
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,522
- Find out what happened to Charles.
- Say it's because you love your son.

68
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,607
It is.

69
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:18,405
Okay. But if I have one moment when
I think otherwise, I'll make you sorry.

70
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,948
That's a promise.

71
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:34,327
<i>Oakland's number one classic station,</i>
<i>taking you back in time, all the time.</i>

72
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:41,470
Isn't that beautiful?
What's Amy's favorite color?

73
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:47,601
Green, that's right.
How green was my valley... Drop that!

74
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,855
Good. Pretty. So pretty.

75
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:56,693
No, Amy, on the paper.
Good.

76
00:10:56,912 --> 00:11:00,656
Amy, get some more paint.

77
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,201
Good. That's green.

78
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,997
No, Amy, on the paper.

79
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:12,126
Good girl. Such a pretty girl.

80
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:15,129
That's your lovey.

81
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:20,259
Amy! Hey, you!

82
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,517
- How did she sleep?
- Great. No nightmares.

83
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:31,270
That's my Amy.

84
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:36,484
Richard, you better clean her up.
It's showtime.

85
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:44,742
Communication is what separated
human from animal. Speech.

86
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:51,749
And for those who couldn't speak,
sign language. An alphabet in gestures.

87
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:55,461
Then came virtual reality.

88
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,134
Sensors worn like clothing could read
and replicate the body's movements.

89
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:08,016
Arliss Wender at MIT was the first to
apply this technology to sign language.

90
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:13,146
<i>Our subject, William,</i>
<i>was born without the organs of speech.</i>

91
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,274
<i>Isn't that right, William?</i>

92
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:20,435
<i>That is absolutely right.</i>

93
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:31,540
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>I have ever heard my own voice.</i>

94
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:39,965
Lights, please.
It's hard to get grants for what I do.

95
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:46,221
Most people just don't believe it.
They think it's a parlor trick. A gag.

96
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,109
But it's no gag.

97
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:55,814
This technology lets me demonstrate
what has never been demonstrated.

98
00:12:56,033 --> 00:13:01,445
Animals can talk. Amy,
could you come down here please?

99
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:20,089
Hello, Amy. Thank you for the flowers.

100
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:22,550
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

101
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,931
Amy, how old are you?

102
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,812
<i>Amy seven.</i>
<i>Amy good gorilla.</i>

103
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:39,025
- <i>Amy pretty.</i>
- Yes, you are.

104
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:43,018
This is a talking gorilla, Moira.
This gorilla is talking!

105
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:46,324
- I know.
- This is really happening.

106
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:50,787
- This isn't Mr. Ed.
- I know it's not Mr. Ed.

107
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:54,123
Amy, look at me.

108
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:59,577
- <i>Amy mother.</i>
- That's right. That's your baby.

109
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:04,133
- <i>Amy wants lunch.</i>
- Okay.

110
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:09,848
- What do you think, Mrs. Romy?
- It's spooky. Very spooky.

111
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:14,978
Amy's above average intelligence
for a gorilla, but she's not a freak.

112
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:22,277
What she has learned, other gorillas
can learn. But it takes money.

113
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:47,094
Amy, calm down. Easy.
It's okay. You're all right.

114
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:54,768
- You've got her sedated. She'll be fine.
- She won't be fine. Nightmares again.

115
00:14:54,987 --> 00:15:00,107
Captive gorillas can degenerate
mentally, having to be destroyed.

116
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:04,445
When she did these paintings
she got better. Why?

117
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,578
Hey, hey...
What's this room starting to look like?

118
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:19,210
She's been painting the jungle!
She wants to go home.

119
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:24,840
Peter, you did a great job.
You taught a gorilla to talk, to paint.

120
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:29,178
You can get a grant for anything
except setting her free.

121
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:33,766
I taught her, now she can teach
the mountain gorillas.

122
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:40,189
- We'll translate other animals' speech.
- Oh, please. Making you Dr. Doolittle?

123
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:45,236
No foundation would fund
an expedition with that objective.

124
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:47,488
I will pay.

125
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:52,160
- I will pay for Amy to go home.
- And who are you?

126
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:57,915
Herkermer Homolka. Romanian. Free
now of the chains of Ceaucescu.

127
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:01,377
Traveling the world, doing good.

128
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:09,552
- A Romanian philanthropist?
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

129
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:13,546
We're taking Amy home. Get packed.

130
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:19,437
Do you know where we're going?
Amy, where are we going?

131
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:23,431
- <i>Jungle. Me jungle.</i>
- She's really excited.

132
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,279
- Are you excited?
- Me? I'm terrified.

133
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:33,285
Safari? I don't even like picnics.
Nice glasses.

134
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:37,998
- That's right. Jungle. Home.
- <i>Tickle me.</i>

135
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:40,917
Time to go.

136
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:54,556
Someone looking for me?

137
00:16:54,775 --> 00:17:00,771
Herkermer Homolka, hello.
The transport.

138
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,859
- Is there a problem?
- Not unless there's a problem.

139
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:14,869
Are you excited? That's a camera.
Be careful, it's expensive.

140
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,872
I think she's got a real eye.

141
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:24,044
- Professor Karen Ross.
- Professor Peter Elliot.

142
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:29,216
Have you got my faxes,
Fed Exes and phone calls?

143
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:36,599
- It's a hastily put together expedition.
- To the Congo, with a talking gorilla.

144
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:41,854
- I need to join up with you.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

145
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:47,985
- This is ready to load on the plane.
- We're taking this stuff off the plane.

146
00:17:48,204 --> 00:17:53,116
- I can pay part of the cost.
- They're taking stuff <i>off</i> the plane?

147
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:58,913
- I'm sorry, we don't need any money.
- You can easily find room for me.

148
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:05,170
It's not a matter of that. It's Amy.
She gets jealous very easily.

149
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:10,456
- Why are you unloading the plane?
- Talk to the operations guy.

150
00:18:10,686 --> 00:18:16,848
I have to be on your manifest, or my
visas are worthless. Name your price.

151
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:22,604
- I have none. I'm not a pound of sugar.
- Don't be hasty, Dr. Elliot.

152
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:27,432
Herkermer Homolka,
formerly of Romania.

153
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:32,405
There seems to be some glitch.
They're unloading the plane.

154
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:38,203
Unfortunately there has been
a slight interruption in my credit flow.

155
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:41,957
- I am unable to pay for the fuel.
- I'll pay for it.

156
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:46,295
- <i>I'll</i> pay for it. How much is it?
- $56,000.

157
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:50,205
56,000?
What are you smiling about?

158
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:54,178
You need me, Dr. Elliot.

159
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:07,274
<i>We've been cleared for take-off.</i>

160
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:11,946
<i>Please make sure</i>
<i>that your seat belts are fastened.</i>

161
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:17,201
- We're returning her to the jungle.
- Not a moment too soon.

162
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,038
- You're the reason she's upset.
- Me? What did I do?

163
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:25,376
- <i>Ugly woman.</i>
- Yes. Now let's get your seat belt on.

164
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:29,286
Forgive me. I'll explain later.
See? I'm buckling my seat belt.

165
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:34,260
- We're all buckling our seat belts.
- You can do it.

166
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:40,349
That's it.
Good girl. Here's an egg.

167
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:46,355
- We do not throw things.
- Is she dangerous?

168
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:49,734
Humans are dangerous,
gorillas are gentle.

169
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:54,530
You think the gorilla
may be dangerous? Maybe so.

170
00:19:54,749 --> 00:20:00,088
Don't perpetuate the King Kong myth,
the myth of the killer ape.

171
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:05,635
- Are you sure some gorillas don't kill?
- You can't be serious.

172
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:10,171
What's your area of expertise,
folk singing?

173
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,925
- Communications technology.
- A geek with a cellphone.

174
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:19,431
I'm a scientist. But you
and your protégé belong in the circus.

175
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:31,568
Just because you came up with
a wad of cash... It's okay, Amy.

176
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:36,448
- <i>Where ground?</i>
- It's fine. We're flying.

177
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:42,829
- We're going to the jungle.
- <i>Amy want green drop drink.</i>

178
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:46,500
<i>Amy want green drop drink.</i>

179
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,253
All right.

180
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:52,214
You'd swear they were married.

181
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:58,262
The "killer ape" is politically incorrect,
but that's not to say it's untrue.

182
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:04,893
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Clichés usually contain some truth.

183
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:16,572
- Are you serving that ape a martini?
- She's allowed one. It'll calm her down.

184
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:21,243
In my life I have heard
many a bizarre story -

185
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:25,623
- containing bizarre truth.

186
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:07,791
- I'm sorry I called you ugly. If I didn't...
- I know, it was for Amy's benefit.

187
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:15,006
Can I ask you something?
Why teach an ape to talk?

188
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:21,012
Why teach anything to anyone? It
doesn't make you rich or get you girls.

189
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:25,517
Why did Prometheus steal fire
only to give it away?

190
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:31,022
One face of the inherent generosity
in the human spirit is the teacher.

191
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:36,194
I repeat, why teach an ape to talk?

192
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:39,906
- No practical reason.
- Then why did you do it?

193
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:45,495
"A lonely impulse of delight."

194
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:48,790
- William Butler Yeats.
- Very good.

195
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:54,213
Did it work?
You're not lonely anymore?

196
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:59,718
Why are you going to Africa?

197
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:05,265
To find something I lost.

198
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:32,209
- Watch your step.
- Dr. Ross!

199
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:42,970
Eddie Ventro. Mr. Travis asked me to
meet the plane, set up your expedition.

200
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:47,308
- Hers? She's just along for the ride.
- Whatever. Be an asshole.

201
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:52,063
- Who is this guy?
- Ventro, transportation and equipment.

202
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:58,194
But I don't supply assholes with new
personalities. Let's see your new plane.

203
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:05,493
You want to sell that gorilla?
It's worth a lot of money.

204
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:11,207
- How much? I'm just curious.
- 20-25 grand for a female.

205
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:16,494
- <i>Amy want to go home.</i>
- I'm taking you home.

206
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:22,844
Whoa, a talking gorilla! I can feel the
money hairs on the back of my neck.

207
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:28,402
Mr. Travis told me to load you up.
You know how to use all this stuff?

208
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,521
- Do you really need a balloon?
- No, let me see that.

209
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,732
- Who are they?
- Hi, fellas!

210
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:40,487
The fuck if I know. We're on
our third government in two years.

211
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:44,950
- So you're our guide?
- No, you've got Monroe Kelly.

212
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,537
- Is he good?
- Very good, and very late.

213
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:55,711
Now what? Why do I feel like
this airport's just gone to shit?

214
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:10,643
- Give me your passports.
- Our guide is Robertson Reynolds.

215
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:15,731
Yeah, I fired him.
Robertson Reynolds is a bird-watcher.

216
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:23,280
The Kigani have had it with Zaire
and they're eating people.

217
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:27,493
You go in with Reynolds, you come out
somebody's bowel movement.

218
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:30,329
Wasn't that easier than customs?

219
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:33,218
Monroe...

220
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:39,547
We need to switch airports.
Bomb in the president's car.

221
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:44,969
- It was his car? Did they get him?
- That's the bad news. No, they didn't.

222
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:49,307
- I hope you folks have lots of money.
- We do.

223
00:25:56,908 --> 00:26:00,443
Thank you. Now run away...

224
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:05,281
Get in the back. Leave the equipment
to Eddie. I would hurry.

225
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,911
- Is this normal?
- You're on your own, Eddie.

226
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:18,211
- Where do you want me to set you up?
- Get a DC-3. The strip near Kegoma.

227
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:23,769
First the Kigani in Zaire, now this
godfather stuff. Not a good day.

228
00:26:23,977 --> 00:26:27,637
- Lower the flaps.
- Good luck!

229
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm getting out of here.

230
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:05,509
- What's going on?
- Are we safe?

231
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:09,013
It's all right, just a few bumps.

232
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,011
Amy, leave that man alone.

233
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:25,529
Amy, don't inhale.

234
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:32,192
Karen Ross? Monroe Kelly.
I'm your great white hunter for this trip.

235
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:36,999
- Though I happen to be black.
- How bad is this news for us?

236
00:27:37,218 --> 00:27:43,423
Whenever leadership comes into
question, they tend to murder everyone.

237
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:48,428
- Oh, my God!
- They live to settle scores.

238
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:53,099
And they've got a lot of scores to settle.
It's like in the Congo.

239
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:59,355
Things are pretty bad in the Congo.
The Kigani are pissed off.

240
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:04,110
Can't blame them. The 20th century
sucks. Maybe the 21st will be better.

241
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:08,271
- Are you a criminal?
- Aren't we all?

242
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,535
I'm not a criminal, I'm a scientist.

243
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:16,696
I run a few guns, you sons of bitches
ruin the world.

244
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:23,536
- We shouldn't be involved with them.
- What would you suggest?

245
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:28,802
As soon as we can,
we should go our own way.

246
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:32,264
Don't I know you?

247
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:35,600
Perhaps. I travel a great deal.

248
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:41,273
- What are you doing with that gorilla?
- Taking her back home to the Congo.

249
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:46,361
Taking her back to the farm
now that she's seen Paree?

250
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:53,024
And this is your cover?
Pretty good. Or, it would have been.

251
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:57,289
- I'm nobody's cover.
- You find yourself in the middle.

252
00:28:57,508 --> 00:29:01,199
- Cover for what?
- I don't know, and she won't tell you.

253
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:06,006
But the money her company
is throwing around isn't for a gorilla.

254
00:29:08,436 --> 00:29:12,721
Relax. You're in better hands
then you should be.

255
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,767
No one can go to Zaire.
The border is shut. There is a revolt.

256
00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:02,188
- It's not my fault. Where's my gorilla?
- She'll be kept on the truck...

257
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:06,568
- Isn't this a hospital?
- This one's decided to speak.

258
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:12,157
- This is pure Kafka.
- Who is Kafka? Tell me!

259
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,201
- Monroe.
- Captain Wanta.

260
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:30,467
How are you?
Miss Ross, such a pleasure.

261
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,057
Have some coffee and cake.

262
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:41,812
Have some!

263
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:47,182
You have our visas. This is a scientific
mission. You have no right to detain us.

264
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:51,989
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

265
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:55,784
So says my computer, Miss Ross.

266
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:04,001
You used to work for the CIA.
Now you're TraviCom.

267
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,078
- They pay better?
- You have a big mouth.

268
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:12,082
Everybody says that about me.
What can I do?

269
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:17,056
- Monroe, you have terrible timing.
- Tell me about it.

270
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:24,188
They blew up the president's Mercedes.
Our country will be in shit for a year.

271
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:29,819
- Captain, I need that truck.
- And ten good men to the border.

272
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:40,986
More.

273
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,222
Mr. Homolka?

274
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:03,645
Stop eating my sesame cake.

275
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:07,732
Stop eating my sesame cake!

276
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:16,074
What are you doing in my country,
you bag of shit?

277
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:20,829
Captain, please.
I only wish to explore and discover.

278
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:27,085
This fellow is a big bag of shit.

279
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:33,175
Shake this rat from off your neck.
He owes money to everybody.

280
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:36,887
I will ask you to wait outside.

281
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:46,021
I like that, Miss Ross. You surprise him.

282
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:57,241
So, I put this away.

283
00:32:58,753 --> 00:33:02,997
Don't want nobody peeking.

284
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:12,965
It's the gorilla that will get you
across the border safely.

285
00:33:13,184 --> 00:33:18,387
Everyone's afraid of being seen in an
American movie being cruel to gorillas.

286
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:23,642
This is the crazy world we live in.
Okay, you can go.

287
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,316
Hit the road, as they say.
And have a nice day.

288
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:50,628
Are you all right?
Admit it, you're glad to see me.

289
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:43,515
- Kahega!
- Monroe!

290
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:47,269
Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy.

291
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:51,023
- Are we in Zaire?
- Tanzania.

292
00:35:08,593 --> 00:35:13,212
Stay close to me.
Amy, come on.

293
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:28,060
- I think this is at my expense.
- You're right.

294
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,862
- When will we get to the rainforest?
- Herkermer Homolka, right?

295
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:43,076
You're not looking for
Solomon's city again, are you?

296
00:35:43,295 --> 00:35:48,331
Mr. Homolka was part of
a disastrous expedition five years ago.

297
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,669
They were looking for a city
called Zinj, but it doesn't exist.

298
00:35:52,888 --> 00:35:57,590
- It does exist!
- Three members died from exposure.

299
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:03,721
- A fourth was somehow shot.
- It was an appalling suicide.

300
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,934
Mr. Homolka had to be
carried out of the jungle by me.

301
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:15,275
- I knew he wasn't a philanthropist.
- He <i>has</i> done good, mostly for himself.

302
00:36:15,494 --> 00:36:18,820
- Shut up, you filthy...
- Filthy what?

303
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:28,622
Forgive me. All that traveling
has left me... shaken.

304
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:32,084
Think nothing of it.
All aboard!

305
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:43,835
- What's all this stuff?
- Courtesy of Eddie Ventro.

306
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:48,976
A customs guy hit me in the head with
a can of peanut oil for stamping visas.

307
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm never going back to that country.

308
00:36:53,699 --> 00:37:00,112
You got everything but the balloon
and the home entertainment center.

309
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:03,407
Your boss says "Call me".

310
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:09,955
You have 11 good guys, significant
firepower and significant technology.

311
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:13,459
Good luck.
Bye, Monroe.

312
00:37:38,286 --> 00:37:43,322
- May I?
- There's one thing I don't understand.

313
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:48,077
- If the border's shut, how do we cross?
- Luck.

314
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,228
- What's going on?
- What the hell is that?

315
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:20,652
Shit. I thought we'd get farther.
I'd put her out now.

316
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:26,491
- Who's firing on us?
- We're violating Zaire's airspace.

317
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,997
She likes bananas? Eat this, darling.
She's going to feel great.

318
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:35,990
Something to keep her calm.
Gorilla Prozac.

319
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:41,089
- Can we make it to Bondo?
- We're done.

320
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:59,358
- What are you doing?
- Step aside, please.

321
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:47,824
Miss Ross. Here.

322
00:39:49,878 --> 00:39:54,914
- Why are they putting on parachutes?
- Figure it out.

323
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:11,598
- This won't work.
- I'll take Amy.

324
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:15,977
- She might get hurt. I can't risk it.
- You know how to fly this plane?

325
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:20,565
The pilot and co-pilot
are already gone.

326
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:40,742
Push me, please.

327
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,589
Harder, please.

328
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:08,531
You want me to push you too?

329
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,868
See you down there.

330
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:26,485
- Where's Amy?
- Sleeping. She woke up coming down.

331
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:32,491
- That lady has some set of teeth.
- We have to call this off.

332
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,484
- I'm not James Bond.
- I'll take care of you.

333
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:39,665
I don't want you to take care of me.

334
00:42:39,884 --> 00:42:43,658
I'm taking a safari
into the Virunga region of the Congo.

335
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:47,131
If you don't want to go, go wherever.

336
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:51,969
But this is a dangerous place,
and people die here very easily.

337
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:55,139
Now, excuse me.

338
00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:14,575
Amy?
Amy?

339
00:43:21,551 --> 00:43:25,492
Such an extraordinary animal.

340
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:31,592
Those paintings. Do you think she was
drawing something from real life?

341
00:43:31,811 --> 00:43:36,055
- I think she was drawing home.
- What about those oval shapes?

342
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:40,435
- Just a shape she likes.
- Perhaps.

343
00:43:40,654 --> 00:43:44,188
- Video game?
- It gives latitude and longitude.

344
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:49,444
- More than that, from the look of it.
- Well, it's a gadget. It has features.

345
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:54,324
- You found some<i>one</i> or some<i>thing?</i>
- A little bit of both.

346
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:59,037
- Why did you quit the CIA?
- I never worked for the CIA.

347
00:43:59,256 --> 00:44:03,374
Of course not.
But if you had, why would you quit?

348
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:08,745
Because they're a loveless bunch
of sons of bitches, and I'm not.

349
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:11,539
Glad to hear it.

350
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:23,311
- Okay, here we go.
- Fabulous equipment.

351
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,149
- I have air-conditioning, too.
- Air-conditioners?

352
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:31,445
- I suppose it is a bit much.
- Shit, I'll take one.

353
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:43,373
Mr. Homolka...

354
00:44:43,592 --> 00:44:48,003
- Please, call me Herkermer.
- All right. You can call me Mr. Kelly.

355
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,844
- I wonder what she's about.
- What do you mean?

356
00:44:56,063 --> 00:45:02,101
What you're after, I've got figured.
What she's after, I don't know.

357
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,770
I'll get you!

358
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:10,401
I'm helping that young scientist
return his ward to the wild.

359
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:16,699
He says the ape may be able to tell us
the thoughts of the wild gorillas.

360
00:45:16,918 --> 00:45:22,788
You're looking for King Solomon's
diamonds. The lost city of Zinj.

361
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:28,544
- I've given it up.
- Never. The problem is, it doesn't exist.

362
00:45:28,763 --> 00:45:34,509
Solomon must have got his diamonds
from Cartier, like everybody else.

363
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:42,850
You like that, don't you?

364
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:48,314
Time for Madam Amy's vitamins.

365
00:45:53,747 --> 00:46:00,869
This is Karen Ross. 81452.
That is KR81452.

366
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:07,615
<i>Travis, do you read? Karen Ross,</i>
<i>81452. Houston, Travis, do you read?</i>

367
00:46:07,844 --> 00:46:13,423
I read and see you. Congratulations
on crossing the border.

368
00:46:13,642 --> 00:46:19,679
- <i>I have a signal from the power pack.</i>
- Good. Find the laser, you find Charles.

369
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:24,392
Let's hope so.
Tomorrow we enter the rainforest.

370
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:29,523
<i>Karen, I've had those images</i>
<i>of the creature analyzed.</i>

371
00:46:35,956 --> 00:46:41,410
- What is it?
- <i>It's something new, but gorilla-like.</i>

372
00:46:41,629 --> 00:46:46,457
- Are you sufficiently armed?
- <i>Yes.</i>

373
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:50,367
The bad news is geo-thermal.
You've got to hurry.

374
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:54,423
The region in the Virungas is bad.
The volcanic activity -

375
00:46:54,642 --> 00:47:01,221
- <i>is breaking out of the graph. It'll blow.</i>
<i>Could be a week, could be sooner...</i>

376
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,101
- Watch out!
- No, dammit! Not again!

377
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,854
I'm terribly sorry.

378
00:47:12,285 --> 00:47:15,277
It's destroyed.

379
00:47:15,496 --> 00:47:18,614
It's completely destroyed.

380
00:47:50,115 --> 00:47:55,735
- What is that?
- Full moon. Colobus monkeys.

381
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:59,812
- That's monkeys?
- Mating season.

382
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:05,078
When there's a moon like that, every
monkey for 200 miles thinks he's Elvis.

383
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:03,095
It's Amy's medical supplies.
They can't get wet.

384
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,433
- Shit! Somebody help me.
- What is it?

385
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:35,188
- There's a creature on my... Look.
- That's a leech.

386
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,984
- Take it off.
- It's your leech, you take it off.

387
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:43,947
- Need some help?
- Here, burn it off with this.

388
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,701
This is disgusting.

389
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:53,290
Thank you for your compassion.

390
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,872
Here.

391
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:13,602
- Monroe...
- Don't indicate you see them.

392
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:18,065
Mizumu. The ghost tribe.
There are probably 20 of them.

393
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:27,491
- I only see two. Are they friendly?
- They're sensitive. Forest people.

394
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:42,048
- Why are they laughing?
- I told them I was in charge.

395
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:46,208
- What's so funny about that?
- I'm black. I should carry luggage.

396
00:51:54,905 --> 00:52:00,567
He says there's a dead white man
with a symbol on his clothes.

397
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,782
Did they say he's dead?

398
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:12,746
- What does "TC" mean?
- TraviCom. The company I work for.

399
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:19,127
They have many levels of "dead". You
aren't dead till you're completely dead.

400
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:02,129
They haven't moved him.
They believe his soul has left his body.

401
00:53:02,348 --> 00:53:08,219
If they move him, his soul will be lost.
They're asking his soul to come back.

402
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,510
Where is the man?

403
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:55,006
It's not him, it's Bob Driscoll.
What happened?

404
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:57,477
Bob?

405
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:02,930
- Who is this man?
- He was on TraviCom's last expedition.

406
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:10,521
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

407
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:13,034
Bob?

408
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:48,654
He's dead.

409
00:54:57,256 --> 00:55:01,709
- That region is uninhabited.
- Well, something inhabits it.

410
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:07,079
We saw the camp destroyed. People
dead. A grey gorilla or something.

411
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:12,178
Two men are missing. Jeffrey Weems
and Charles Travis, my fiancé.

412
00:55:12,397 --> 00:55:14,430
- My <i>former</i> fiancé.
- We'd better get to him, then.

413
00:55:18,945 --> 00:55:22,772
Beautiful boats.
Money's a wonderful thing.

414
00:55:22,991 --> 00:55:28,486
- Give her the banana with the dope?
- Yes, he gave it to her.

415
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:32,323
I know. Shitty Peter.

416
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:35,993
Hey, what's this?

417
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:43,501
<i>All the leaves are brown</i>
<i>and the sky is grey</i>

418
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:50,008
<i>I went for a walk</i>
<i>on a winter's day</i>

419
00:55:50,446 --> 00:55:57,870
<i>I'd be safe and warm</i>
<i>if I was in LA</i>

420
00:55:58,078 --> 00:56:04,335
<i>California dreamin'</i>
<i>on such a winter's day...</i>

421
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:52,842
- What is this Zinj, Mr. Homolka?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

422
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:57,847
It's believed that King Solomon had
a diamond mine in a city called Zinj.

423
00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:00,350
Diamonds?

424
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:07,107
I suppose there's no point
in playing stupid.

425
00:57:07,315 --> 00:57:11,945
We shall arrive there together,
we shall all be rich.

426
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:15,240
That's fine with me. But there's no Zinj.

427
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:20,527
Half the safaris never made it back,
the other half came back with nothing.

428
00:57:20,745 --> 00:57:25,292
Yes, but we have a trumping card
that they did not have.

429
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,087
- We do?
- We do. That gorilla.

430
00:57:29,296 --> 00:57:32,716
- She knows where it is.
- The gorilla?

431
00:57:32,925 --> 00:57:37,971
As a young man,
I found a book in Soviet Georgia.

432
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:42,684
It contained a detailed drawing
of the city of Zinj.

433
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:46,647
The drawing contained
a peculiar decoration.

434
00:57:46,855 --> 00:57:49,650
An open eye.

435
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:54,905
Later, on safari, I found this.

436
00:57:57,241 --> 00:58:00,327
It's the same symbol.

437
00:58:01,787 --> 00:58:05,624
Look at this.

438
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:09,284
The gorilla drew this.

439
00:58:10,504 --> 00:58:15,582
It is the same image. It is the open eye.

440
00:58:15,801 --> 00:58:21,390
That gorilla has seen the city of Zinj.

441
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:29,232
- And she will take us there!
- Have you taken your medication?

442
00:58:33,111 --> 00:58:37,740
Have your laugh, and I will have mine.

443
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:46,082
Shit...

444
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:50,044
- What is it?
- The signal stopped.

445
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:54,841
- Does that mean?
- It just means the signal stopped.

446
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:58,178
I don't know what it means.

447
00:59:57,696 --> 00:59:59,782
No problem.

448
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:29,020
Oh, my God!

449
01:00:37,945 --> 01:00:41,240
- Shoot it!
- Amy!

450
01:01:00,009 --> 01:01:02,804
Head for shore!

451
01:01:17,986 --> 01:01:23,492
- How is he?
- It's just a big cut. I'll stitch it up.

452
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,454
- What's that?
- A plane.

453
01:01:28,538 --> 01:01:34,503
Good luck to them. The Zaire Air Force
has got a piece of their ass.

454
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:43,095
Pitch camp. Tomorrow, Mt. Mukenko.

455
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:08,746
She's excited. She was born someplace
on the other side of this mountain.

456
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:39,652
Wow, it's beautiful.

457
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:43,907
Is this your valley, Amy?
It is, isn't it?

458
01:02:44,115 --> 01:02:46,910
That's your home.

459
01:02:49,162 --> 01:02:53,416
Pretty jungle, that's right.

460
01:02:58,463 --> 01:03:04,094
- What's she doing?
- Yearning for the place in her heart.

461
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:09,683
- The place in <i>your</i> heart, Herkermer.
- You may call me Mr. Homolka.

462
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:14,855
Come on, Amy, let's go.

463
01:03:15,063 --> 01:03:20,569
- We've lost two porters. Ran away.
- And they didn't invite me?

464
01:03:21,528 --> 01:03:25,396
You want your glove?
All right, sit still.

465
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:35,292
This is a fork in the road.
We can go left or right.

466
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:41,131
- The wrong way loses us a few days.
- We must follow the gorilla.

467
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:46,136
- That would be left.
- My last coordinates lead this way.

468
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:51,225
- That would be right.
- <i>Amy, Peter, go this way.</i>

469
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:57,982
Well, I don't have her passion.
I'll follow the gorilla.

470
01:04:05,072 --> 01:04:09,076
This doesn't seem
like the right way to me.

471
01:04:35,228 --> 01:04:37,355
Good Lord.

472
01:04:40,608 --> 01:04:44,310
- It's that plane we saw burning.
- Who were they?

473
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:48,064
Travis must have sent
another expedition.

474
01:04:48,283 --> 01:04:53,955
Looks like a rocket got them.
There's no point going in there.

475
01:04:54,164 --> 01:05:01,629
- My God, what a waste of life.
- We'd better keep moving.

476
01:05:20,941 --> 01:05:26,655
- Don't move. If you run...
- He'll chase me. I read the books.

477
01:05:58,938 --> 01:06:02,858
- You did good.
- Where did you go?

478
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:05,945
I ran away. Sorry.

479
01:06:07,988 --> 01:06:12,034
- He looked right into my eyes.
- He's a silverback.

480
01:06:12,243 --> 01:06:17,373
I never thought you could just
walk along and see them.

481
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:19,709
Amy.

482
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:35,256
<i>Hello. I'm Amy.</i>
<i>Good, good, good. Amy.</i>

483
01:06:57,205 --> 01:07:00,875
Let's take this off.

484
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:06,329
- She doesn't really belong anywhere.
- No, she belongs here.

485
01:07:26,026 --> 01:07:30,906
- What the hell is that?
- Perimeter alarm around their camp.

486
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:35,410
But where's the camp,
and their equipment?

487
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:56,223
I don't understand it. There had to be
300 pounds of equipment.

488
01:07:56,432 --> 01:08:00,477
And there's no sign of the bodies.

489
01:08:26,754 --> 01:08:29,841
- It's a dead end?
- Maybe, maybe not.

490
01:08:40,268 --> 01:08:41,936
Bingo!

491
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:39,901
- Son of a bitch!
- What is this?

492
01:09:41,413 --> 01:09:45,834
It is the city of Zinj...

493
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:50,464
...that I have looked for all my life.

494
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:59,265
See, the eyes.

495
01:09:59,473 --> 01:10:02,726
It is the same.

496
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:09,775
Kahega, guns up. Stay alert.

497
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:18,034
Come here, Amy. Stay with me.

498
01:12:05,643 --> 01:12:11,482
First they found the diamonds,
Solomon's men.

499
01:12:12,358 --> 01:12:15,976
A diamond mine of incredible bounty.

500
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:23,359
Then they built the city around
the mine, so that it should be protected.

501
01:12:23,578 --> 01:12:26,873
The savagery of the guards
was legendary.

502
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:31,377
They instantly fell upon
any thief, any transgressor.

503
01:12:31,586 --> 01:12:36,007
The diamonds flowed
to the kingdom of Solomon.

504
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:40,386
- Why did the city die?
- Maybe the mines ran dry.

505
01:12:40,595 --> 01:12:43,765
No, the diamonds are here!

506
01:12:43,973 --> 01:12:48,019
- Monroe, over here!
- What is it?

507
01:12:50,897 --> 01:12:54,484
I found this.

508
01:13:01,992 --> 01:13:07,789
Don't go in there. I'll go. Don't be
so John Wayne, you could get killed.

509
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:12,878
I'm not going in there alone, either.

510
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:17,716
- I must go.
- I'll just stay out here with Amy.

511
01:13:17,924 --> 01:13:21,459
Not alone you won't. Kahega!

512
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,623
Stay close together.
Homolka...

513
01:13:55,254 --> 01:14:00,384
The same hieroglyphics, over and over.

514
01:14:01,719 --> 01:14:04,722
What do they mean?

515
01:14:10,019 --> 01:14:12,104
Amy, don't wander off!

516
01:14:12,313 --> 01:14:16,609
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

517
01:14:16,817 --> 01:14:20,686
- What's your name?
- Claude.

518
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:25,618
That's an unusual name for
somebody from... Where are you from?

519
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:30,738
- Mombasa.
- It's an unusual name for Mombasa.

520
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:37,370
- Have you ever been to Mombasa?
- No.

521
01:14:37,588 --> 01:14:41,374
Then what do you know about it?

522
01:14:45,138 --> 01:14:47,515
I want to go home.

523
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:57,265
Amy?
Amy, come here.

524
01:14:57,484 --> 01:15:02,614
Where are you, girl?
Come on, I'm not fooling around.

525
01:15:07,994 --> 01:15:10,455
Amy...

526
01:15:12,124 --> 01:15:16,044
Come here, girl.

527
01:15:28,015 --> 01:15:31,059
Charles!

528
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,730
Charlie!

529
01:15:35,647 --> 01:15:40,861
- What are those holes?
- Lava tubes. It flows through here.

530
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:46,283
This must lead to the mine.

531
01:15:46,492 --> 01:15:49,495
Bring a light.

532
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:54,416
Here.

533
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:58,327
Now here. Come on.

534
01:15:58,546 --> 01:16:01,882
Up here.
No!

535
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:07,221
- That's not going anywhere.
- Where can they be? What happened?

536
01:16:07,972 --> 01:16:12,310
- Let's get out of here while we still can.
- <i>Help me!</i>

537
01:16:12,518 --> 01:16:15,646
- What's that?
- Richard!

538
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:23,029
Help me! Help me!

539
01:16:23,237 --> 01:16:27,075
- Richard!
- Let me go! Let me go!

540
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:31,454
Oh, my God! Something...

541
01:17:03,612 --> 01:17:07,365
- Richard...
- No, let's get out of here.

542
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,663
It's okay.

543
01:17:27,886 --> 01:17:31,473
They're some kind of gorillas.

544
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:37,813
I never saw an animal move like that.
They just kill.

545
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:43,986
That's why the diamonds were never
found. The killer ape myth is true.

546
01:18:11,055 --> 01:18:14,183
<i>Bad gorillas.</i>

547
01:18:14,392 --> 01:18:17,603
Let me turn your volume down.

548
01:18:21,232 --> 01:18:24,485
Here's your lovey.

549
01:18:26,237 --> 01:18:32,358
- It's okay.
- <i>Mother. Mother.</i>

550
01:18:32,577 --> 01:18:36,195
Yes, you're okay now.

551
01:18:42,962 --> 01:18:47,091
- See anything?
- No, but I'm the last line of defense.

552
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:52,764
Sensor-operated machine pistols are
set up, if anything comes within 40 ft.

553
01:18:52,972 --> 01:18:57,227
You really know how to pack.

554
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:09,698
- I don't see anything.
- Put that out.

555
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:31,136
They're testing their perimeter.

556
01:19:39,186 --> 01:19:44,316
- Are they intelligent?
- Yes, but they shouldn't be aggressive.

557
01:19:44,525 --> 01:19:50,489
They're too damn smart. They're
out there, but what are they doing?

558
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:53,190
Monroe!

559
01:20:49,841 --> 01:20:52,302
Get down!

560
01:21:02,771 --> 01:21:07,849
- They're gone.
- We're out of here at first light.

561
01:21:10,195 --> 01:21:17,285
I have translated those hieroglyphics
we saw inscribed everywhere.

562
01:21:17,494 --> 01:21:22,708
- What do they say?
- "We are watching you."

563
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:39,308
Where are the bodies?

564
01:21:39,516 --> 01:21:45,971
- Have you seen Amy? She's gone.
- Along with two porters and Homolka.

565
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:52,394
- I'm going to find her.
- People come first, then gorillas.

566
01:21:53,489 --> 01:21:59,161
We'll retrieve our comrades, then we'll
retrieve your missing gorilla. Mount up!

567
01:23:30,337 --> 01:23:34,758
Peter, take this.
I don't care if you don't like guns.

568
01:23:41,015 --> 01:23:47,187
- Here it is. They domesticated gorillas.
- Domesticated? They're killing a man.

569
01:23:47,396 --> 01:23:55,143
They bred them to violence. They
looked for the trait and encouraged it.

570
01:23:55,362 --> 01:23:59,492
Guard dogs
who turned on their masters.

571
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:03,746
What's that smell?

572
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:10,159
These are the bones of gorillas.
Of normal gorillas.

573
01:24:12,588 --> 01:24:16,717
- This one's skull was crushed.
- Feel that?

574
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,872
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

575
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:52,170
Don't go this way. It's all caved in.

576
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:57,592
- I was trying to find the mines...
- Be quiet. Got any flares, Kahega?

577
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:05,267
- What's making my eyes burn?
- Sulfur fumes.

578
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:45,557
- What the hell...
- It's the mines!

579
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:50,594
"We are watching you." It's the trainers
talking. The teacher is watching you.

580
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:54,765
Dead teachers.

581
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,531
Look.

582
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:08,623
Yes, yes, yes. I knew it was true!

583
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:15,244
The city of Zinj, the diamonds...

584
01:26:17,882 --> 01:26:23,096
Every word of it was absolutely true.

585
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:28,017
I'd leave those alone.

586
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:37,694
- Any other way out of here?
- Not that I've noticed.

587
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:41,030
Help me. Fill up everything.

588
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:54,951
- You've got to get me out of here!
- Take a number.

589
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:59,122
- But we're going to be rich!
- Is that a way out?

590
01:27:57,399 --> 01:28:01,153
- Let's go.
- Stay close together.

591
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:10,580
- What is it?
- It's a geode. A giant diamond.

592
01:28:10,788 --> 01:28:16,252
- They cut him off. Kahega!
- Check if there's a way out back there.

593
01:28:51,871 --> 01:28:53,748
Jeffrey...

594
01:28:53,957 --> 01:28:56,115
Charlie!

595
01:29:00,422 --> 01:29:03,049
- It's him?
- It's him.

596
01:29:08,263 --> 01:29:10,588
Come on.

597
01:29:23,028 --> 01:29:27,115
- Is there a way out back there?
- No, nothing.

598
01:29:27,324 --> 01:29:33,038
- We're almost out of rounds.
- Buy me two minutes.

599
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:37,437
<i>Ugly gorillas. Go away.</i>

600
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:44,903
They don't know what to make of it.

601
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:57,624
- Amy.
- <i>Mother. Mother.</i>

602
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:06,716
- <i>Peter hug Amy.</i>
- Maternal instinct, long may she reign.

603
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:11,430
- What are you doing?
- We're getting out of here.

604
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:15,225
They're going on
the endangered species list.

605
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:25,527
Come on, Monroe. Move!

606
01:31:25,736 --> 01:31:30,032
- What the hell is that?
- The latest thing in communication.

607
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:15,943
Come on.

608
01:32:35,139 --> 01:32:37,298
Go, Amy!

609
01:32:58,288 --> 01:33:00,697
Keep going!

610
01:33:12,636 --> 01:33:16,932
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

611
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,744
Hang on!

612
01:33:39,705 --> 01:33:41,707
Watch out!

613
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:47,421
- Go, Amy!
- Hurry!

614
01:33:56,972 --> 01:34:00,309
- Amy, come on!
- You can do it!

615
01:34:02,144 --> 01:34:06,732
- Keep moving.
- Head for higher ground.

616
01:34:39,265 --> 01:34:45,469
Get the yellow case from that plane.
It's a balloon. I'll get the transmitter.

617
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:49,807
Amy!

618
01:34:55,782 --> 01:35:00,370
- How close is the border?
- Not far.

619
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:05,740
KR 81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?

620
01:35:05,959 --> 01:35:10,338
<i>KR 81452.</i>
<i>Houston, Travis, do you read?</i>

621
01:35:11,965 --> 01:35:18,420
KR 81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?

622
01:35:21,099 --> 01:35:28,148
Karen, I thought I'd lost you.
I sent another expedition.

623
01:35:28,357 --> 01:35:34,405
- <i>Did you get it?</i>
- I have bad news. Charles was killed.

624
01:35:34,613 --> 01:35:39,952
Did you get the diamond?
Did you?

625
01:35:42,788 --> 01:35:46,792
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Good girl.

626
01:35:48,961 --> 01:35:54,800
Do you remember I said
that if you sent me here -

627
01:35:55,009 --> 01:35:59,722
- for some diamond,
and not for Charlie, I'd make you sorry?

628
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:03,059
<i>Karen, of course I'm upset.</i>

629
01:36:03,267 --> 01:36:08,262
- <i>But what's done is done. I could...</i>
- I know. You need a new cash machine.

630
01:36:08,481 --> 01:36:12,568
<i>What'll happen to the satellite if I put</i>
<i>its phone number in the laser and fire?</i>

631
01:36:12,777 --> 01:36:16,697
The transmitter chip
has the satellite's number.

632
01:36:20,785 --> 01:36:26,624
<i>It's a 12,000 channel chip. If you</i>
<i>put it through the diamond... Karen!</i>

633
01:36:31,713 --> 01:36:35,331
This is for you, Charlie.

634
01:36:42,098 --> 01:36:44,423
Amy!

635
01:36:46,394 --> 01:36:49,647
There you are.

636
01:36:56,905 --> 01:37:00,909
Amy, you saved me.

637
01:37:01,117 --> 01:37:03,495
It's okay.

638
01:37:20,637 --> 01:37:23,599
Thank you.

639
01:37:26,643 --> 01:37:29,521
I love you, too.

640
01:37:30,522 --> 01:37:33,400
Mother?

641
01:37:35,694 --> 01:37:40,282
Oh, I see.
It's Africa. It's your mother.

642
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:43,619
Amy, where did you go?

643
01:37:45,454 --> 01:37:48,905
Good gorillas?
What good gorillas?

644
01:37:57,425 --> 01:38:00,428
Handsome fella.

645
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:25,953
Amy...

646
01:38:31,751 --> 01:38:35,255
- Look at that.
- Is that Amy with the...

647
01:38:35,463 --> 01:38:39,332
The silverback. So she's...

648
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:44,389
I see. I see.

649
01:38:48,143 --> 01:38:50,895
She's home.

650
01:39:07,204 --> 01:39:11,072
- Will she be all right?
- <i>They</i> know what to do.

651
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:15,796
- We've got to go.
- Bye, Amy.

652
01:39:49,538 --> 01:39:53,751
Peter, would you do me a favor?
Throw this away for me.

653
01:39:55,544 --> 01:39:57,870
You sure?

654
01:40:00,049 --> 01:40:02,593
Ouch.

655
01:40:08,057 --> 01:40:12,228
- There's a wind.
- I hope it blows us someplace good.
