1
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,998
<i>Dr Ross</i>, <i>we've got satellite</i>
<i>from the Congo.</i>

2
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:04,606
It won't work. The old man's got me
changing the code every three hours.

3
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:08,948
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.
- Very inventive.

4
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,585
- We should have a visual momentarily.
- They said they found it.

5
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:19,357
Seven volcanoes, and he picks the
right one. His luck's finally changed.

6
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,299
- <i>Karen.</i>
- I read you, Charles. And I see you.

7
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,531
<i>Well</i>, <i>eureka and all that.</i>
<i>I found the bloody thing.</i>

8
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:33,475
- What <i>wa</i>s that?
- <i>The whole place does the shimmy.</i>

9
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:38,379
- How's the volcano?
- <i>Acting very much like a volcano.</i>

10
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:43,955
- <i>I wouldn't build condominiums.</i>
- Charles, did you really find it?

11
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:49,288
<i>Chemically flawless</i>,
<i>blue diamond alluvia.</i>

12
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,456
<i>Johnny-on-the-spot phasic laser.</i>

13
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,899
<i>This will look kind of raw</i>
<i>without a real diamond.</i>

14
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:13,317
- <i>That test came back positive.</i>
- Oh, my God.

15
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:18,180
<i>We found the sand in a mineral stream.</i>
<i>Jeffrey's searching for the source.</i>

16
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,886
- I'll get Travis.
- <i>Wait. Jeffrey should share the glory.</i>

17
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:28,193
- <i>Let's link up again in one hour.</i>
- Great. Give me your coordinates.

18
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,867
Charles...?

19
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,909
- Jeffrey...
- Charlie, over here.

20
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,214
Charlie, I think this
may really be something.

21
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,014
- We haven't got much time.
- I'll show you.

22
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,523
Jump in.

23
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,952
- What?
- I'll go first.

24
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,126
Jeffrey!

25
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,284
Jeffrey!

26
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,253
- What is this?
- Come on.

27
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,100
From below it just looks like jungle,
but it's not just jungle. See?

28
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,133
Jesus Christ.

29
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,440
This is a big deal.
This is a big find.

30
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:48,547
I can't believe it. All these centuries,
just sitting here, <i>wa</i>iting for lucky us.

31
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,555
Listen, I raised Houston,
they're getting the old man.

32
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,522
Come share the glory.

33
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,959
- We'll have to get another team here.
- Let me grab my bag.

34
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:21,109
- Perfect? A flawless diamond?
- He found it. He <i>wa</i>s right.

35
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,876
With the right laser and diamonds, we'll
take over the communications industry.

36
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:32,353
Charles says a laser with a diamond
like that can punch a hole in the moon.

37
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,164
Come on, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey!

38
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,600
Come on, we're supposed to transmit
in ten minutes.

39
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,719
Now you're throwing stuff at me?

40
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:25,034
- Where is he?
- I don't know. They're ten minutes late.

41
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,706
Activate the remote.

42
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:39,784
- I guess he's still looking for Jeffrey.
- Pan the camera.

43
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,358
What in God's name...?

44
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,036
Lock your remote. Back scan.
Give me thermal readout.

45
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,243
- I can see seven dead people.
- What's that sound?

46
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,600
I didn't see him.
Charles!

47
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,142
- I'll get help.
- I had the code changed.

48
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,370
Well, what is it?

49
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,309
Rudy?

50
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,315
- Sir?
- Use the fire extinguisher on that.

51
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,510
- What's the code, sir?
- Do what I say!

52
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,790
- No one knows this happened but us.
- Families must be notified. Your wife.

53
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,765
We don't know he's dead.
If it's reported, they'll close the border.

54
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:04,138
- What <i>wa</i>s that thing? A gorilla?
- Baboon. Gorillas don't do that.

55
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,303
- It could have been a rival company.
- Not another paranoid fantasy.

56
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:13,248
I need those diamonds, Dr Ross!
It's the future.

57
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:19,324
- Most believe children are the future.
- 40,000 people are depending on me.

58
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,326
This satellite is our cash cow.

59
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:27,865
In three years it'll be obsolete. I need
a new cash machine. This diamond's it!

60
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:33,165
- Charles knew it. That's why he went.
- He went into the Congo to please you.

61
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:39,300
- I know you had feelings for him.
- I almost <i>married</i> him.

62
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:44,438
You have to go down there, Dr Ross.
You're good in the field.

63
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,609
The laser's power pack
should give off a readable signal.

64
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:52,520
- Take over an existing expedition.
- What are you talking about?

65
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:58,096
There's no time! Once we let out what's
happened, Zaire will shut the border.

66
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:05,102
- Are you human?
- I'll be human later. I'll get good people.

67
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,668
- Find out what happened to Charles.
- Say it's because you love your son.

68
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,777
It is.

69
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:18,679
Okay. But if I have one moment when
I think otherwise, I'll make you sorry.

70
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,409
That's a promise.

71
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:34,332
<i>Oakland's number one classic station</i>,
<i>taking you back in time</i>, <i>all the time.</i>

72
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:41,667
Isn't that beautiful?
What's Amy's favourite colour?

73
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:47,802
Green, that's right.
How green <i>wa</i>s my valley... Drop that!

74
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,007
Good. Pretty. So pretty.

75
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:57,486
No, Amy, on the paper.
Good.

76
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,217
Amy, get some more paint.

77
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,390
Good. That's green.

78
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:08,363
No, Amy, on the paper.

79
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,561
Good girl. Such a pretty girl.

80
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,002
That's your lovey.

81
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,444
Amy! Hey, you!

82
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,752
- How did she sleep?
- Great. No nightmares.

83
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,385
That's my Amy.

84
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,621
Richard, you better clean her up.
It's showtime.

85
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:44,865
Communication is what separated
human from animal. Speech.

86
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:51,940
And for those who couldn't speak,
sign language. An alphabet in gestures.

87
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,478
Then came virtual reality.

88
00:11:55,648 --> 00:12:01,382
Sensors worn like clothing could read
and replicate the body's movements.

89
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:08,255
Arliss Wender at MIT <i>wa</i>s the first to
apply this technology to sign language.

90
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:13,296
<i>Our subject</i>, <i>William</i>,
<i>was born without the organs of speech.</i>

91
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,458
<i>Isn't that right</i>, <i>William?</i>

92
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,537
<i>That is absolutely right.</i>

93
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:31,575
<i>This is the fiirst time</i>
<i>I have ever heard my own voice.</i>

94
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:40,116
Lights, please.
It's hard to get grants for what I do.

95
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:46,754
Most people just don't believe it.
They think it's a parlour trick. A gag.

96
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,059
But it's no gag.

97
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:56,368
This technology lets me demonstrate
what has never been demonstrated.

98
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,169
Animals can talk.

99
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,505
Amy, could you come down
here please?

100
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,154
Hello, Amy. Thank you for the flowers.

101
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,732
<i>Hello</i>, <i>Peter.</i>

102
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,335
Amy, how old are you?

103
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:34,912
<i>Amy seven.</i>
<i>Amy good gorilla.</i>

104
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,177
- <i>Amy pretty.</i>
- Yes, you are.

105
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:43,412
This is a talking gorilla, Moira.
This gorilla is talking!

106
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,524
- I know.
- This is really happening.

107
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,992
- This isn't Mr Ed.
- I know it's not Mr Ed.

108
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,294
Amy, look at me.

109
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:59,836
- <i>Amy mother.</i>
- That's right. That's your baby.

110
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,271
- <i>Amy wants lunch.</i>
- Okay.

111
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,813
- What do you think, Mrs Romy?
- It's spooky. Very spooky.

112
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:15,045
Amy's above average intelligence
for a gorilla, but she's not a freak.

113
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:22,389
What she has learned, other gorillas
can learn. But it takes money.

114
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:47,213
Amy, calm down. Easy.
It's okay. You're all right.

115
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:55,026
- You've got her sedated. She'll be fine.
- She won't be fine. Nightmares again.

116
00:14:55,194 --> 00:15:00,257
Captive gorillas can degenerate
mentally, having to be destroyed.

117
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,731
When she did these paintings
she got better. Why?

118
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:12,738
Hey, hey...
What's this room starting to look like?

119
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,281
She's been painting the jungle!
She <i>wa</i>nts to go home.

120
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:25,287
Peter, you did a great job.
You taught a gorilla to talk, to paint.

121
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:30,156
You can get a grant for anything
except setting her free.

122
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,924
I taught her, now she can teach
the mountain gorillas.

123
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:40,436
- We'll translate other animals' speech.
- Oh, please. Making you Dr Doolittle?

124
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:45,441
No foundation would fund
an expedition with that objective.

125
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,602
I will pay.

126
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:52,345
- I will pay for Amy to go home.
- And who are you?

127
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:58,215
Herkermer Homolka. Romanian. Free
now of the chains of Ceaucescu.

128
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,518
Travelling the world, doing good.

129
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,197
- A Romanian philanthropist?
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

130
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,668
We're taking Amy home. Get packed.

131
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:19,767
Do you know where we're going?
Amy, where are we going?

132
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,574
- <i>Jungle. Mejungle.</i>
- She's really excited.

133
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,480
- Are you excited?
- Me? I'm terrified.

134
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,090
Safari? I don't even like picnics.
Nice glasses.

135
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:38,295
- That's right. Jungle. Home.
- <i>Tickle me.</i>

136
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,428
Time to go.

137
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,339
Someone looking for me?

138
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,974
Herkermer Homolka, hello.
The transport.

139
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,055
- Is there a problem?
- Not unless there's a problem.

140
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,828
Are you excited? That's a camera.
Be careful, it's expensive.

141
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,992
I think she's got a real eye.

142
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:24,075
- Professor Karen Ross.
- Professor Peter Elliot.

143
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:29,173
Have you got my faxes,
Fed Exes and phone calls?

144
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:36,754
- It's a hastily put together expedition.
- To the Congo, with a talking gorilla.

145
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:44,453
- I need to join up with you.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

146
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,227
- This is ready to load on the plane.
- We're taking this stuff off the plane.

147
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,235
- I can pay part of the cost.
- They're taking stuff <i>off</i> the plane?

148
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:58,900
- I'm sorry, we don't need any money.
- You can easily find room for me.

149
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:05,449
It's not a matter of that. It's Amy.
She gets jealous very easily.

150
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:11,578
- Why are you unloading the plane?
- Talk to the operations guy.

151
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:16,854
I have to be on your manifest, or my
visas are worthless. Name your price.

152
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:23,628
- I have none. I'm not a pound of sugar.
- Don't be hasty, Dr Elliot.

153
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:27,738
Herkermer Homolka,
formerly of Romania.

154
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:33,572
There seems to be some glitch.
They're unloading the plane.

155
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:38,182
Unfortunately there has been
a slight interruption in my credit flow.

156
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,979
- I am unable to pay for the fuel.
- I'll pay for it.

157
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:46,454
- <i>I'll</i> pay for it. How much is it?
- $56,000.

158
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,990
56,000?

159
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,253
What are you smiling about?

160
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,331
You need me, Dr Elliot.

161
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,069
<i>We've been cleared for take-off.</i>

162
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,273
<i>Please make sure</i>
<i>that your seat belts are fastened.</i>

163
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,411
- We're returning her to the jungle.
- Not a moment too soon.

164
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,491
- You're the reason she's upset.
- Me? What did I do?

165
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,528
- <i>Ugly woman.</i>
- Yes. Now let's get your seat belt on.

166
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,428
Forgive me. I'll explain later.
See? I'm buckling my seat belt.

167
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:34,368
- We're all buckling our seat belts.
- You can do it.

168
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,769
That's it.
Good girl. Here's an egg.

169
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,448
- We do not throw things.
- Is she dangerous?

170
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,610
Humans are dangerous,
gorillas are gentle.

171
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,690
You think the gorilla
may be dangerous? Maybe so.

172
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,220
Don't perpetuate the King Kong myth,
the myth of the killer ape.

173
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:05,735
- Are you sure some gorillas don't kill?
- You can't be serious.

174
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,429
What's your area of expertise,
folk singing?

175
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,505
- Communications technology.
- A geek with a cell phone.

176
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,617
I'm a scientist. But you
and your prot Ág Á belong in the circus.

177
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:31,727
Just because you came up with
a <i>wa</i>d of cash... It's okay, Amy.

178
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,664
- <i>Where ground?</i>
- It's fine. We're flying.

179
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:42,831
- We're going to the jungle.
- <i>Amy want green drop drink.</i>

180
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,605
<i>Amy want green drop drink.</i>

181
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,712
All right.

182
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,310
You'd swear they were married.

183
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:58,354
The "killer ape" is politically incorrect,
but that's not to say it's untrue.

184
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:05,020
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Cliches usually contain some truth.

185
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:16,707
- Are you serving that ape a martini?
- She's allowed one. It'll calm her down.

186
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,736
In my life I have heard
many a bizarre story -

187
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:26,714
- containing bizarre truth.

188
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:07,917
- I'm sorry I called you ugly. If I didn't...
- I know, it <i>wa</i>s for Amy's benefit.

189
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,726
Can I ask you something?

190
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,196
Why teach an ape to talk?

191
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:21,203
Why teach anything to anyone? It
doesn't make you rich or get you girls.

192
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,671
Why did Prometheus steal fire
only to give it a<i>wa</i>y?

193
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:31,214
One face of the inherent generosity
in the human spirit is the teacher.

194
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,144
I repeat, why teach an ape to talk?

195
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,018
- No practical reason.
- Then why did you do it?

196
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,928
"A Ionely impulse of delight."

197
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,925
- William Butler Yeats.
- Very good.

198
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:54,400
Did it work?
You're not Ionely anymore?

199
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,409
Why are you going to Africa?

200
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,672
To find something I lost.

201
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,332
- Watch your step.
- Dr Ross!

202
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:43,113
Eddie Ventro. Mr Travis asked me to
meet the plane, set up your expedition.

203
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,452
- Hers? She's just along for the ride.
- Whatever. Be an asshole.

204
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:52,222
- Who is this guy?
- Ventro, transportation and equipment.

205
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:58,029
But I don't supply assholes with new
personalities. Let's see your new plane.

206
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,642
You <i>wa</i>nt to sell that gorilla?
It's worth a lot of money.

207
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:11,374
- How much? I'm just curious.
- 20-25 grand for a female.

208
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,178
- <i>Amy want to go home.</i>
- I'm taking you home.

209
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:23,021
Whoa, a talking gorilla! I can feel the
money hairs on the back of my neck.

210
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:28,758
Mr Travis told me to load you up.
You know how to use all this stuff?

211
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,665
- Do you really need a balloon?
- No, let me see that.

212
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,030
- Who are they?
- Hi, fellas!

213
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,506
The fuck if I know. We're on
our third government in two years.

214
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,116
- So you're our guide?
- No, you've got Monroe Kelly.

215
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,582
- Is he good?
- Very good, and very late.

216
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:55,893
Now what? Why do I feel like
this airport's just gone to shit?

217
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,874
- Give me your passports.
- Our guide is Robertson Reynolds.

218
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:16,309
Yeah, I fired him.
Robertson Reynolds is a bird-<i>wa</i>tcher.

219
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:23,649
The Kigani have had it with Zaire
and they're eating people.

220
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:28,054
You go in with Reynolds, you come out
somebody's bowel movement.

221
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,524
Wasn't that easier than customs?

222
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,897
Monroe...

223
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,895
We need to switch airports.
Bomb in the president's car.

224
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:45,304
- It <i>wa</i>s his car? Did they get him?
- That's the bad news. No, they didn't.

225
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,809
- I hope you folks have lots of money.
- We do.

226
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,320
Thank you. Now run a<i>wa</i>y...

227
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:05,589
Get in the back. Leave the equipment
to Eddie. I would hurry.

228
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,860
- Is this normal?
- You're on your own, Eddie.

229
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:19,066
- Where do you <i>wa</i>nt me to set you up?
- Get a DC-3. The strip near Kegoma.

230
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,943
First the Kigani in Zaire, now this
godfather stuff. Not a good day.

231
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,709
- Lower the flaps.
- Good luck!

232
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,974
I'm getting out of here.

233
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,955
- What's going on?
- Are we safe?

234
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,017
It's all right, just a few bumps.

235
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,065
Amy, leave that man alone.

236
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,108
Amy, don't inhale.

237
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:32,274
Karen Ross? Monroe Kelly.
I'm your great white hunter for this trip.

238
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,149
- Though I happen to be black.
- How bad is this news for us?

239
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:43,989
Whenever leadership comes into
question, they tend to murder everyone.

240
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:48,622
- Oh, my God!
- They live to settle scores.

241
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,294
And they've got a lot of scores to settle.
It's like in the Congo.

242
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:59,501
Things are pretty bad in the Congo.
The Kigani are pissed off.

243
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:04,980
Can't blame them. The 20th century
sucks. Maybe the 21st will be better.

244
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,517
- Are you a criminal?
- Aren't we all?

245
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,589
I'm not a criminal, I'm a scientist.

246
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:16,853
I run a few guns, you sons of bitches
ruin the world.

247
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:24,197
- We shouldn't be involved with them.
- What would you suggest?

248
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:29,329
As soon as we can,
we should go our own <i>wa</i>y.

249
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,804
Don't I know you?

250
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,646
Perhaps. I travel a great deal.

251
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:41,374
- What are you doing with that gorilla?
- Taking her back home to the Congo.

252
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:46,490
Taking her back to the farm
now that she's seen Paree?

253
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:53,860
And this is your cover?
Pretty good. Or, it would have been.

254
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:58,298
- I'm nobody's cover.
- You find yourself in the middle.

255
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,337
- Cover for what?
- I don't know, and she won't tell you.

256
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:06,068
But the money her company
is throwing around isn't for a gorilla.

257
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,844
Relax. You're in better hands
than you should be.

258
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,892
No one can go to Zaire.
The border is shut. There is a revolt.

259
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:02,522
- It's not my fault. Where's my gorilla?
- She'll be kept on the truck...

260
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,693
- Isn't this a hospital?
- This one's decided to speak.

261
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,034
- This is pure Kafka.
- Who is Kafka? Tell me!

262
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,416
- Monroe.
- Captain Wanta.

263
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,687
How are you?
Miss Ross, such a pleasure.

264
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,558
Have some coffee and cake.

265
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,638
Have some!

266
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,236
You have our visas. This is a scientific
mission. You have no right to detain us.

267
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,348
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

268
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,880
So says my computer, Miss Ross.

269
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:04,125
You used to work for the CIA.
Now you're TraviCom.

270
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:08,129
- They pay better?
- You have a big mouth.

271
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:12,235
Everybody says that about me.
What can I do?

272
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:17,134
- Monroe, you have terrible timing.
- Tell me about it.

273
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:24,373
They blew up the president's Mercedes.
Our country will be in shit for a year.

274
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:29,953
- Captain, I need that truck.
- And ten good men to the border.

275
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,161
More.

276
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,207
Mr Homolka?

277
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,910
Stop eating my sesame cake.

278
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,823
Stop eating my sesame cake!

279
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,192
What are you doing in my country,
you bag of shit?

280
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,963
Captain, please.
I only wish to explore and discover.

281
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:27,271
This fellow is a big bag of shit.

282
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:33,315
Shake this rat from off your neck.
He owes money to everybody.

283
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,850
I will ask you to <i>wa</i>it outside.

284
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,158
I like that, Miss Ross. You surprise him.

285
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,907
So, I put this a<i>wa</i>y.

286
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,571
Don't <i>wa</i>nt nobody peeking.

287
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:13,113
It's the gorilla that will get you
across the border safely.

288
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:18,558
Everyone's afraid of being seen in an
American movie being cruel to gorillas.

289
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:23,759
This is the crazy world we live in.
Okay, you can go.

290
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,667
Hit the road, as they say.
And have a nice day.

291
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,118
Are you all right?
Admit it, you're glad to see me.

292
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,070
- Kahega!
- Monroe!

293
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,384
Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy.

294
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,180
- Are we in Zaire?
- Tanzania.

295
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:13,500
Stay close to me.
Amy, come on.

296
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,454
- I think this is at my expense.
- You're right.

297
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:38,262
- When will we get to the rainforest?
- Herkermer Homolka, right?

298
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:42,202
You're not looking for
Solomon's city again, are you?

299
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:48,844
Mr Homolka <i>wa</i>s part of
a disastrous expedition five years ago.

300
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,710
They were looking for a city
called Zinj, but it doesn't exist.

301
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:57,947
- It does exist!
- Three members died from exposure.

302
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:03,788
- A fourth <i>wa</i>s somehow shot.
- It <i>wa</i>s an appalling suicide.

303
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,091
Mr Homolka had to be
carried out of the jungle by me.

304
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:15,399
- I knew he <i>wa</i>sn't a philanthropist.
- He <i>has</i> done good, mostly for himself.

305
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,906
- Shut up, you filthy...
- Filthy what?

306
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:28,710
Forgive me. All that travelling
has left me... shaken.

307
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,220
Think nothing of it.
All aboard!

308
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:43,957
- What's all this stuff?
- Courtesy of Eddie Ventro.

309
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:49,163
A customs guy hit me in the head with
a can of peanut oil for stamping visas.

310
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,606
I'm never going back to that country.

311
00:36:53,778 --> 00:37:00,513
You got everything but the balloon
and the home entertainment centre.

312
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,518
Your boss says "Call me".

313
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:10,753
You have 11 good guys, significant
firepower and significant technology.

314
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,623
Good luck.

315
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,025
Bye, Monroe.

316
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:43,323
- May I?
- There's one thing I don't understand.

317
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:48,193
- If the border's shut, how do we cross?
- Luck.

318
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,357
- What's going on?
- What the hell is that?

319
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,827
Shit. I thought we'd get farther.
I'd put her out now.

320
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:26,527
- Who's firing on us?
- We're violating Zaire's airspace.

321
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:32,165
She likes bananas? Eat this, darling.
She's going to feel great.

322
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:36,074
Something to keep her calm.
Gorilla Prozac.

323
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,275
- Can we make it to Bondo?
- We're done.

324
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,462
- What are you doing?
- Step aside, please.

325
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,442
Miss Ross. Here.

326
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:55,058
- Why are they putting on parachutes?
- Figure it out.

327
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,570
- This won't work.
- I'll take Amy.

328
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,074
- She might get hurt. I can't risk it.
- You know how to fly this plane?

329
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,307
The pilot and co-pilot
are already gone.

330
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,925
Push me, please.

331
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,002
Harder, please.

332
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,556
You <i>wa</i>nt me to push you too?

333
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,068
See you down there.

334
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:26,937
- Where's Amy?
- Sleeping. She woke up coming down.

335
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:32,481
- That lady has some set of teeth.
- We have to call this off.

336
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,643
- I'm not James Bond.
- I'll take care of you.

337
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,812
I don't <i>wa</i>nt you to take care of me.

338
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,892
I'm taking a safari
into the Virunga region of the Congo.

339
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:47,325
If you don't <i>wa</i>nt to go, go wherever.

340
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:52,094
But this is a dangerous place,
and people die here very easily.

341
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,096
Now, excuse me.

342
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,750
Amy...?

343
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,624
Such an extraordinary animal.

344
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:32,072
Those paintings. Do you think she <i>wa</i>s
drawing something from real life?

345
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:36,406
- I think she <i>wa</i>s drawing home.
- What about those oval shapes?

346
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,539
- Just a shape she likes.
- Perhaps.

347
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,387
- Video game?
- It gives latitude and longitude.

348
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:49,583
- More than that, from the look of it.
- Well, it's a gadget. It has features.

349
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,595
- You found someone or something?
- A little bit of both.

350
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:59,099
- Why did you quit the CIA?
- I never worked for the CIA.

351
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:03,228
Of course not.
But if you had, why would you quit?

352
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:09,107
Because they're a loveless bunch
of sons of bitches, and I'm not.

353
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,678
Glad to hear it.

354
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:23,457
- Okay, here we go.
- Fabulous equipment.

355
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:27,222
- I have air-conditioning, too.
- Air-conditioners?

356
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,925
- I suppose it is a bit much.
- Shit, I'll take one.

357
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,537
Mr Homolka...

358
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:49,448
- Please, call me Herkermer.
- All right. You can call me Mr Kelly.

359
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,925
- I wonder what she's about.
- What do you mean?

360
00:44:56,093 --> 00:45:02,259
What you're after, I've got figured.
What she's after, I don't know.

361
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,367
I'll get you!

362
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:10,507
I'm helping that young scientist
return his <i>wa</i>rd to the wild.

363
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:16,738
He says the ape may be able to tell us
the thoughts of the wild gorillas.

364
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:20,543
You're looking for King Solomon's
diamonds. The lost city of Zinj.

365
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:28,721
- I've given it up.
- Never. The problem is, it doesn't exist.

366
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:33,829
Solomon must have got his diamonds
from Cartier, like everybody else.

367
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,901
You like that, don't you?

368
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,508
Time for Madam Amy's vitamins.

369
00:45:54,017 --> 00:46:01,082
This is Karen Ross. 81452.
That is KR81452.

370
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:07,959
<i>Travis</i>, <i>do you read? Karen Ross</i>,
<i>81452. Houston</i>, <i>Travis</i>, <i>do you read?</i>

371
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,967
I read and see you. Congratulations
on crossing the border.

372
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:19,808
- <i>I have a signal from the power pack.</i>
- Good. Find the laser, you find Charles.

373
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:24,380
Let's hope so.
Tomorrow we enter the rainforest.

374
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:29,645
<i>Karen</i>, <i>I've had those images</i>
<i>of the creature analysed.</i>

375
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:41,564
- What is it?
- <i>It's something new</i>, <i>but gorilla-like.</i>

376
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:46,567
- Are you sufficiently armed?
- <i>Yes.</i>

377
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,468
The bad news is geo-thermal.
You've got to hurry.

378
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,509
The region in the Virungas is bad.
The volcanic activity -

379
00:46:54,678 --> 00:47:00,344
- <i>is breaking out of the graph. It'll blow.</i>
<i>Could be a week</i>, <i>could be sooner...</i>

380
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:06,345
- Watch out!
- No, dammit! Not again!

381
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,014
I'm terribly sorry.

382
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,121
It's destroyed.

383
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,695
It's completely destroyed.

384
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:55,902
- What is that?
- Full moon. Colobus monkeys.

385
00:47:56,073 --> 00:48:00,100
- That's monkeys?
- Mating season.

386
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:05,112
When there's a moon like that, every
monkey for 200 miles thinks he's Elvis.

387
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:03,134
It's Amy's medical supplies.
They can't get wet.

388
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,451
- Shit! Somebody help me.
- What is it?

389
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:35,758
- There's a creature on my... Look.
- That's a leech.

390
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,095
- Take it off.
- It's your leech, you take it off.

391
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:43,763
- Need some help?
- Here, burn it off with this.

392
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,866
This is disgusting.

393
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,777
Thank you for your compassion.

394
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,886
Here.

395
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,560
- Monroe...
- Don't indicate you see them.

396
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:18,136
Mizumu. The ghost tribe.
There are probably 20 of them.

397
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:27,608
- I only see two. Are they friendly?
- They're sensitive. Forest people.

398
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,092
- Why are they laughing?
- I told them I <i>wa</i>s in charge.

399
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,326
- What's so funny about that?
- I'm black. I should carry luggage.

400
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:59,105
He says there's a dead white man
with a symbol on his clothes.

401
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,219
Did they say he's dead?

402
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:13,260
- What does 'TC" mean?
- TraviCom. The company I work for.

403
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:19,266
They have many levels of "dead". You
aren't dead till you're completely dead.

404
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,941
They haven't moved him.
They believe his soul has left his body.

405
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:08,347
If they move him, his soul will be lost.
They're asking his soul to come back.

406
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,376
Where is the man?

407
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,157
It's not him, it's Bob Driscoll.
What happened?

408
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,664
Bob?

409
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:03,137
- Who is this man?
- He <i>wa</i>s on TraviCom's last expedition.

410
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,436
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

411
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,543
Bob...?

412
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,351
He's dead.

413
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:10,101
- That region is uninhabited.
- Well, something inhabits it.

414
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:16,573
We saw the camp destroyed. People
dead. A grey gorilla or something.

415
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:20,873
Two men are missing. Jeffrey Weems
and Charles Travis, my fianc Á.

416
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,241
- My <i>former</i> fianc Á.
- We'd better get to him, then.

417
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,354
Beautiful boats.
Money's a wonderful thing.

418
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:37,053
- Give her the banana with the dope?
- Yes, he gave it to her.

419
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,256
I know. Shitty Peter.

420
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:42,867
Hey, what's this?

421
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:51,167
<i>All the leaves are brown</i>
<i>and the sky is grey</i>

422
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:57,071
<i>I went for a walk</i>
<i>on a winter's day</i>

423
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:04,351
<i>I'd be safe and warm</i>
<i>if I was in LA</i>

424
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:12,455
<i>California dreamin'</i>
<i>on such a winter's day...</i>

425
00:01:55,775 --> 00:02:00,974
- What is this Zinj, Mr Homolka?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

426
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:05,982
It's believed that King Solomon had
a diamond mine in a city called Zinj.

427
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,249
Diamonds?

428
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:15,283
I suppose there's no point
in playing stupid.

429
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:20,364
We shall arrive there together,
we shall all be rich.

430
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,263
That's fine with me. But there's no Zinj.

431
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:28,464
Half the safaris never made it back,
the other half came back with nothing.

432
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:33,476
Yes, but we have a trumping card
that they did not have.

433
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:37,241
- We do?
- We do. That gorilla.

434
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:40,944
- She knows where it is.
- The gorilla?

435
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:46,184
As a young man,
I found a book in Soviet Georgia.

436
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:50,796
It contained a detailed drawing
of the city of Zinj.

437
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,865
The drawing contained
a peculiar decoration.

438
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:57,832
An open eye.

439
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:02,532
Later, on safari, I found this.

440
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:08,437
It's the same symbol.

441
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,810
Look at this.

442
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:16,521
The gorilla drew this.

443
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:23,822
It is the same image. It is the open eye.

444
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,590
That gorilla has seen the city of Zinj.

445
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:37,436
- And she will take us there!
- Have you taken your medication?

446
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:44,711
Have your laugh, and I will have mine.

447
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,453
Shit...

448
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:58,291
- What is it?
- The signal stopped.

449
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:02,093
- Does that mean...?
- It just means the signal stopped.

450
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,761
I don't know what it means.

451
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,659
No problem.

452
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,754
Oh, my God!

453
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,298
- Shoot it!
- Amy!

454
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:10,491
Head for shore!

455
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:30,740
- How is he?
- It's just a big cut. I'll stitch it up.

456
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:35,079
- What's that?
- A plane.

457
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:42,853
Good luck to them. The Zaire Air Force
has got a piece of their ass.

458
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,031
Pitch camp. Tomorrow, Mt. Mukenko.

459
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:16,960
She's excited. She <i>wa</i>s born someplace
on the other side of this mountain.

460
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:47,185
Wow, it's beautiful.

461
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:52,021
Is this your valley, Amy?
It is, isn't it?

462
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:55,167
That's your home.

463
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:01,532
Pretty jungle, that's right.

464
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:12,378
- What's she doing?
- Yearning for the place in her heart.

465
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:18,251
- The place in <i>your</i> heart, Herkermer.
- You may call me Mr Homolka.

466
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:22,089
Come on, Amy, let's go.

467
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,691
- We've lost two porters. Ran a<i>wa</i>y.
- And they didn't invite me?

468
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:33,396
You <i>wa</i>nt your glove?
All right, sit still.

469
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:43,539
This is a fork in the road.
We can go left or right.

470
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:48,619
- The wrong <i>wa</i>y loses us a few days.
- We must follow the gorilla.

471
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:54,389
- That would be left.
- My last coordinates lead this <i>wa</i>y.

472
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,429
- That would be right.
- <i>Amy</i>, <i>Peter</i>, <i>go this way.</i>

473
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:06,161
Well, I don't have her passion.
I'll follow the gorilla.

474
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:16,438
This doesn't seem
like the right <i>wa</i>y to me.

475
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,076
Good Lord.

476
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:52,579
- It's that plane we saw burning.
- Who were they?

477
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:56,312
Travis must have sent
another expedition.

478
00:09:56,489 --> 00:10:00,585
Looks like a rocket got them.
There's no point going in there.

479
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:06,728
- My God, what a <i>wa</i>ste of life.
- We'd better keep moving.

480
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:35,025
- Don't move. If you run...
- He'll chase me. I read the books.

481
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:10,294
- You did good.
- Where did you go?

482
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:14,122
I ran a<i>wa</i>y. Sorry.

483
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:20,231
- He looked right into my eyes.
- He's a silverback.

484
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:23,204
I never thought you could just
<i>wa</i>lk along and see them.

485
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:27,907
Amy.

486
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:43,560
<i>Hello. I'm Amy.</i>
<i>Good</i>, <i>good</i>, <i>good. Amy.</i>

487
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:07,976
Let's take this off.

488
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:14,248
- She doesn't really belong an<i>yw</i>here.
- No, she belongs here.

489
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:39,112
- What the hell is that?
- Perimeter alarm around their camp.

490
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:42,083
But where's the camp,
and their equipment?

491
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:04,405
I don't understand it. There had to be
300 pounds of equipment.

492
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,272
And there's no sign of the bodies.

493
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,935
- It's a dead end?
- Maybe, maybe not.

494
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,186
Bingo!

495
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:47,044
- Son of a bitch!
- What is this?

496
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,616
It is the city of Zinj...

497
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,721
...that I have looked for all my life.

498
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,499
See, the eyes.

499
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,927
It is the same.

500
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,265
Kahega, guns up. Stay alert.

501
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,741
Come here, Amy. Stay with me.

502
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:18,252
First they found the diamonds,
Solomon's men.

503
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:24,099
A diamond mine of incredible bounty.

504
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:31,604
Then they built the city around
the mine, so that it should be protected.

505
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:35,110
The savagery of the guards
<i>wa</i>s legendary.

506
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,580
They instantly fell upon
any thief, any transgressor.

507
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:43,881
The diamonds flowed
to the kingdom of Solomon.

508
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:48,516
- Why did the city die?
- Maybe the mines ran dry.

509
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:51,925
No, the diamonds are here!

510
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:55,123
- Monroe, over here!
- What is it?

511
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,070
I found this.

512
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:16,282
Don't go in there. I'll go. Don't be
so John Wayne, you could get killed.

513
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:21,119
I'm not going in there alone, either.

514
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:25,855
- I must go.
- I'll just stay out here with Amy.

515
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,090
Not alone you won't. Kahega!

516
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,990
Stay close together.
Homolka...

517
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:08,396
The same hieroglyphics, over and over.

518
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,134
What do they mean?

519
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,383
Amy, don't <i>wa</i>nder off!

520
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,888
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

521
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:27,218
- What's your name?
- Claude.

522
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:33,729
That's an unusual name for
somebody from... Where are you from?

523
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:38,563
- Mombasa.
- It's an unusual name for Mombasa.

524
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:44,197
- Have you ever been to Mombasa?
- No.

525
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,705
Then what do you know about it?

526
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,716
I <i>wa</i>nt to go home.

527
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,787
Amy?

528
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:06,421
Amy, come here.

529
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,830
Where are you, girl?
Come on, I'm not fooling around.

530
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:15,167
Amy...

531
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:22,037
Come here, girl.

532
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:37,956
Charles!

533
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:41,857
Charlie!

534
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:48,463
- What are those holes?
- Lava tubes. It flows through here.

535
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,840
This must lead to the mine.

536
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,937
Bring a light.

537
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:00,482
Here.

538
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:06,555
Now here. Come on.

539
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,058
Up here.
No...!

540
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,789
- That's not going an<i>yw</i>here.
- Where can they be? What happened?

541
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:20,500
- Let's get out of here while we still can.
- <i>Help me!</i>

542
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:23,737
- What's that?
- Richard!

543
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,342
Help me!

544
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,140
Help me!

545
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:34,542
- Richard!
- Let me go! Let me go!

546
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:37,813
Oh, my God! Something...

547
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:14,754
- Richard...
- No, let's get out of here.

548
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,022
It's okay.

549
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,843
They're some kind of gorillas.

550
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:45,986
I never saw an animal move like that.
They just kill.

551
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:52,153
That's why the diamonds were never
found. The killer ape myth is true.

552
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:21,415
<i>Bad gorillas.</i>

553
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,663
Let me turn your volume down.

554
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,467
Here's your lovey.

555
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:40,774
- It's okay.
- <i>Mother. Mother.</i>

556
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:42,345
Yes, you're okay now.

557
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:55,257
- See anything?
- No, but I'm the last line of defence.

558
00:23:55,427 --> 00:24:00,888
Sensor-operated machine pistols are
set up, if anything comes within 40 ft.

559
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,330
You really know how to pack.

560
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:16,405
- I don't see anything.
- Put that out.

561
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,269
They're testing their perimeter.

562
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:52,505
- Are they intelligent?
- Yes, but they shouldn't be aggressive.

563
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:57,815
They're too damn smart. They're
out there, but what are they doing?

564
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,252
Monroe!

565
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,178
Get down!

566
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:15,428
- They're gone.
- We're out of here at first light.

567
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:25,535
I have translated those hieroglyphics
we saw inscribed eve<i>ryw</i>here.

568
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:30,840
- What do they say?
- 'We are <i>wa</i>tching you."

569
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:47,526
Where are the bodies?

570
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:54,535
- Have you seen Amy? She's gone.
- Along with two porters and Homolka.

571
00:26:54,706 --> 00:27:00,076
- I'm going to find her.
- People come first, then gorillas.

572
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:06,775
We'll retrieve our comrades,
then we'll retrieve your missing gorilla.

573
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:08,885
Mount up!

574
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:42,669
Peter, take this.
I don't care if you don't like guns.

575
00:28:49,254 --> 00:28:55,420
- Here it is. They domesticated gorillas.
- Domesticated? They're killing a man.

576
00:28:55,593 --> 00:29:02,362
They bred them to violence. They
looked for the trait and encouraged it.

577
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:07,300
Guard dogs
who turned on their masters.

578
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:11,064
What's that smell?

579
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:18,080
These are the bones of gorillas.
Of normal gorillas.

580
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:23,546
- This one's skull <i>wa</i>s crushed.
- Feel that?

581
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:53,680
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

582
00:29:56,688 --> 00:30:00,522
Don't go this <i>wa</i>y. It's all caved in.

583
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:05,561
- I <i>wa</i>s trying to find the mines...
- Be quiet. Got any flares, Kahega?

584
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,369
- What's making my eyes burn?
- Sulphur fumes.

585
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:53,767
- What the hell...
- It's the mines!

586
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:58,780
'We are <i>wa</i>tching you." It's the trainers
talking. The teacher is <i>wa</i>tching you.

587
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:00,817
Dead teachers.

588
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,487
Look.

589
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:17,227
Yes, yes, yes. I knew it <i>wa</i>s true!

590
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:22,434
The city of Zinj, the diamonds...

591
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:31,172
Every word of it <i>wa</i>s absolutely true.

592
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:35,111
I'd leave those alone.

593
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:44,423
- Any other <i>wa</i>y out of here?
- Not that I've noticed.

594
00:31:46,264 --> 00:31:49,165
Help me. Fill up everything.

595
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:02,803
- You've got to get me out of here!
- Take a number.

596
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,314
- But we're going to be rich!
- Is that a <i>wa</i>y out?

597
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,042
- Let's go.
- Stay close together.

598
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:18,748
- What is it?
- It's a geode. A giant diamond.

599
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:24,394
- They cut him off. Kahega!
- Check if there's a <i>wa</i>y out back there.

600
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:01,926
Jeffrey...

601
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:05,395
Charlie!

602
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,171
- It's him?
- It's him.

603
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,804
Come on.

604
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:34,029
- Is there a <i>wa</i>y out back there?
- No, nothing.

605
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:39,527
- We're almost out of rounds.
- Buy me two minutes.

606
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,527
<i>Ugly gorillas. Go away.</i>

607
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,671
They don't know what to make of it.

608
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,786
- Amy.
- <i>Mother. Mother.</i>

609
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:15,389
- <i>Peter hug Amy.</i>
- Maternal instinct, long may she reign.

610
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:19,593
- What are you doing?
- We're getting out of here.

611
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,568
They're going on
the endangered species list.

612
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,648
Come on, Monroe. Move!

613
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,912
- What the hell is that?
- The latest thing in communication.

614
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:43,554
Come on.

615
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:44,482
Go, Amy!

616
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,811
Keep going!

617
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:23,487
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

618
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:44,374
Hang on!

619
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,916
Watch out!

620
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:54,453
- Go, Amy!
- Hurry!

621
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:08,403
- Amy, come on!
- You can do it!

622
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:11,435
Keep moving.

623
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,138
Head for higher ground.

624
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:53,678
Get the yellow case from that plane.
It's a balloon. I'll get the transmitter.

625
00:39:55,753 --> 00:39:57,015
Amy!

626
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:08,525
- How close is the border?
- Not far.

627
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:13,966
KR 81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?

628
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:19,201
<i>KR 81452.</i>
<i>Houston</i>, <i>Travis</i>, <i>do you read?</i>

629
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:26,580
KR 81452.
Houston, Travis, do you read?

630
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:36,282
Karen, I thought I'd lost you.
I sent another expedition.

631
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,626
- <i>Did you get it?</i>
- I have bad news. Charles <i>wa</i>s killed.

632
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,793
Did you get the diamond?
Did you?

633
00:40:51,108 --> 00:40:55,067
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Good girl.

634
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:02,913
Do you remember I said
that if you sent me here -

635
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:07,888
- for some diamond,
and not for Charlie, I'd make you sorry?

636
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:11,255
<i>Karen</i>, <i>of course I'm upset.</i>

637
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:16,525
- <i>But what's done is done. I could...</i>
- I know. You need a new cash machine.

638
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,761
<i>What'll happen to the satellite if I put</i>
<i>its phone number in the laser and fiire?</i>

639
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,832
The transmitter chip
has the satellite's number.

640
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:34,849
<i>It's a 12</i>,<i>000 channel chip. If you</i>
<i>put it through the diamond... Karen!</i>

641
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,787
This is for you, Charlie.

642
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:51,595
Amy!

643
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:56,071
There you are.

644
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:07,377
Amy, you saved me.

645
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,612
It's okay.

646
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:30,797
Thank you.

647
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:36,903
I love you, too.

648
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,406
Mother?

649
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:46,617
Oh, I see.
It's Africa. It's your mother.

650
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:51,686
Amy, where did you go?

651
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:57,100
Good gorillas?
What good gorillas?

652
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:06,833
Handsome fella.

653
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:34,136
Amy...

654
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:43,309
- Look at that.
- Is that Amy with the...

655
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,075
The silverback. So she's...

656
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,145
I see. I see.

657
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:58,190
She's home.

658
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:19,346
- Will she be all right?
- <i>They</i> know what to do.

659
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:23,077
- We've got to go.
- Bye, Amy.

660
00:44:58,355 --> 00:45:02,985
Peter, would you do me a favour?
Throw this a<i>wa</i>y for me.

661
00:45:03,794 --> 00:45:05,455
You sure?

662
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,264
Ouch.

663
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:20,709
- There's a wind.
- I hope it blows us someplace good.
