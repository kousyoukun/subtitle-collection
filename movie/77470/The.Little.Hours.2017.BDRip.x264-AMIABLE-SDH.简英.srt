1
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:30,138
{\an8}格塔纳纳 1347年

2
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,462
朝赞课时你人呢?为什么不在?
{\fs12}Where were you during Lauds? Why did you miss Lauds?

3
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,356
她昨晚跑了 我必须找到她
{\fs12}She got out last night, and I had to find her.

4
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,380
花了我一整个上午
{\fs12}Took me all morning.

5
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,342
她又出来了? - 是
{\fs12}She got out again? - Yeah.

6
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,385
她是穿过大门的?
{\fs12}Do you think she's getting through the gate?

7
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,345
你觉得她能穿过大门吗?
{\fs12}You think she could get through the gate?

8
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:40,763
我应该去检查大门
{\fs12}I should check the gates.

9
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,375
也许她是穿墙
{\fs12}Or maybe she got through the wall.

10
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,242
她怎么可能穿墙?
{\fs12}How would she get through the wall, though?

11
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,426
我不知道 驴子值得你那么关心?
{\fs12}I don't know. Why do you care about the donkey so much?

12
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,937
因为没道理啊
{\fs12}Just doesn't make any sense.

13
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,564
你为什么穿黑袍?现在是春天
{\fs12}Why are you wearing your black habit? It's spring.

14
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,136
因为我出去的时候 天已经黑了
{\fs12}Because it was dark when I left,

15
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,002
这件离我最近 我随手抓起的 
{\fs12}and it was the closest thing to me, so I grabbed it.

16
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,026
我现在去换衣服
{\fs12}I'm gonna change.

17
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,987
这么多问题干嘛?
{\fs12}Why are you asking me so many questions?

18
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,157
早晨好 修女们
{\fs12}Beautiful morning, Sisters.

19
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,093
别他妈的跟我们说话 爬虫
{\fs12}Hey, don't fucking talk to us! - Fucking creep.

20
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,429
叫你不要跟我们说话 你这坨屎 - 你竟敢这样 混蛋
{\fs12}I told you to never talk to us, you piece of shit! - How dare you, fuckers!

21
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,773
滚开
{\fs12}Get the fuck out of here!

22
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,882
主啊 您有福的艺术 教我领会汝的意志
{\fs12}Blessed art thou, O Lord. Teach me to know thy will.

23
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,512
用这些唇 让汝的奖赏被记录下来
{\fs12}By these lips, let the awards thou makest ever be recorded.

24
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,390
欢欣 我等发现了这笔伟大的财产
{\fs12}Blithely, as one that has found great possessions,

25
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,767
我听从您的命令
{\fs12}I follow thy decrees.

26
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,687
使我思虑 我仍背负您判定的罪名
{\fs12}Bethinking me still of the charge thou givest,

27
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,981
我会记下汝之足迹
{\fs12}I will mark thy footsteps.

28
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,899
签下契约 作为我的喜悦
{\fs12}Be thy covenant ever my delight,

29
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,194
汝之言语 留在记忆中
{\fs12}thy words kept in memory.

30
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,949
主基督为我们受了诱惑和苦难
{\fs12}Christ the Lord was tempted and suffered for us.

31
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,243
来吧 让我们崇拜他
{\fs12}Come, let us adore him.

32
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,175
你今天早上为什么没参加朝赞课?
{\fs12}So, why weren't you at Lauds this morning?

33
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,890
因为驴子跑到树林里了 我得去抓她
{\fs12}Because the donkey escaped in the woods, and I had to catch her.

34
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,374
驴子又逃走了?
{\fs12}The donkey escaped again?

35
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,459
是 我想她穿过了大门
{\fs12}Yeah. I think she got through the gate.

36
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,751
她穿过了大门
{\fs12}She got through the gate.

37
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,776
但是我保证不会再发生了
{\fs12}All right. Well... - But I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

38
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,280
好吧 我会告诉妥玛索神父
{\fs12}Okay, good. I'll tell Father Tommasso.

39
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,521
亚历山大修女怎么了?
{\fs12}What's going on with Sister Alessandra?

40
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,464
她太过了
{\fs12}She's been so out of it.

41
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,859
我不知道 她爸爸可能来了
{\fs12}I don't know. Her dad's probably visiting or something.

42
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:41,967
再次?
{\fs12}Again?

43
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,719
是 她有妄想症
{\fs12}Yeah. She's fucking delusional.

44
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,554
是 她太妄想了
{\fs12}Yeah. She's so delusional.

45
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,724
她很可悲
{\fs12}She's pathetic.

46
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,060
就因为爸爸捐钱给修道院
{\fs12}Just because your dad gives money to the convent,

47
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,871
并不意味着你能为所欲为
{\fs12}doesn't mean you're gonna get everything you want.

48
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,146
是
{\fs12}Yeah.

49
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,582
那天我撞见她 
{\fs12}I walked in on her the other day,

50
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,292
她只是直直盯着窗外
{\fs12}and she was literally just staring out the window

51
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,636
10分钟不动
{\fs12}for, like, 10 minutes, not moving.

52
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,152
真的?
{\fs12}Really?

53
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,155
她可能在做男人的白日梦
{\fs12}She's probably, like, daydreaming about some guy

54
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,592
天降神屌 神奇地带走她
{\fs12}that's gonna magically come and take her away from here.

55
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,201
就像 "祝你好运"
{\fs12}It's like, "Good luck."

56
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,286
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

57
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,299
玛利亚院长刚才跟你说了什么?
{\fs12}So, what was Mother Marea saying to you earlier?

58
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,885
没什么 管好你自己的事
{\fs12}Nothing. Mind your own fucking business.

59
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,859
好
{\fs12}Okay.

60
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,351
但我会的
{\fs12}But I'll do that, yeah.

61
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,725
如果你愿意 我可以打扫
{\fs12}I can sweep it if you want me to.

62
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,591
由于某种原因 那里老是杂乱无章
{\fs12}For some reason, it keeps getting unorganized,

63
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,009
我真的不确定是谁干的
{\fs12}and I'm not really sure who's doing that.

64
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,844
好吧 也许你去打扫地窖
{\fs12}Okay, yes, maybe you could sweep the cellar,

65
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,578
因为那很脏
{\fs12}because that's very dusty, you know.

66
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,431
地窖和祭坛
{\fs12}That's the cellar and the altar.

67
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,706
我可以重排熏香 
{\fs12}I can organize all the incense,

68
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,768
不知为何 总是一团糟
{\fs12}because, for some reason, it keeps getting all messed up,

69
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,392
我真的不确定是谁干的
{\fs12}and I'm not really sure who's doing that.

70
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,313
院长 还有件事你应该知道
{\fs12}But also, Mother, there's something else you should know.

71
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,463
说吧 
{\fs12}Yes?

72
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:05,935
昨晚晚餐...
{\fs12}Last night at dinner...

73
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,968
我看到拉提扎修女 拿了两份
{\fs12}Mmm-hmm. - I saw Sister Latizia take two portions.

74
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,612
我不知道 也许你没清点
{\fs12}I don't know. Maybe you're not counting,

75
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,846
也许这无关紧要
{\fs12}so maybe it doesn't matter.

76
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,223
以防你需要知道 是拉提扎修女拿的
{\fs12}Just in case you are, it was Sister Latizia.

77
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,828
我不认为你应该关心...
{\fs12}I don't think you should be concerning yourself

78
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,854
别人吃了多少
{\fs12}with the amount somebody is eating.

79
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:20,149
不同时期 需要的食物不等量
{\fs12}We all require different amounts of food.

80
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:23,819
有些日子多吃点 有时少吃
{\fs12}I know that some days I need more food, some days less...

81
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,404
仔细观察我的饭量
{\fs12}So, watching me eat so carefully,

82
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,656
那会让我不舒服
{\fs12}that would make me uncomfortable.

83
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,784
所以你最好别为此烦恼
{\fs12}So I don't think you should be bothering yourself with that.

84
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,076
是 院长
{\fs12}Yes, Mother.

85
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,371
嗨 爸爸
{\fs12}Hi, Dad.

86
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,664
嗨 甜心
{\fs12}Hi, sweetheart.

87
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,396
你好吗 我的天使?
{\fs12}How are you, my angel?

88
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,792
我很好 你好吗?
{\fs12}I'm good. How are you?

89
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,044
我很好 你看上去很漂亮
{\fs12}I'm well. You look beautiful.

90
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,421
谢谢
{\fs12}Thank you.

91
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,506
我能做什么
{\fs12}What I can make out.

92
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,842
你看起来棒极了 他们喂饱你吗?
{\fs12}You look terrific. Are they feeding you?

94
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,948
他们应该喂饱你 因为我们捐钱了
{\fs12}They should be feeding you, for all the money we send them here.

95
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,140
但你看起来很美
{\fs12}But you look beautiful.

96
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,808
谢谢  妈妈怎么样?
{\fs12}Thank you. Thank you. How's Mom?

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,603
妈妈很好 大家都好
{\fs12}Mom is good. Mom is... Everybody's well.

98
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,063
好啊 麦钱特·里卡多 他怎么样?
{\fs12}Good. The merchant Ricardo, how's he?

99
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,567
麦钱特·里卡多 很高兴你问起他 他很好
{\fs12}Merchant Ricardo, uh, yes. Glad you brought it up. He's good.

100
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,859
他问起过我吗?
{\fs12}Has he asked about me?

101
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:05,985
肯定 肯定他有提起
{\fs12}Sure. You bet he has.

103
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,888
上次你和我说话的时候
{\fs12}You know, last time you and I spoke,

104
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,343
我希望保密全部嫁妆的情况
{\fs12}I was hoping that we'd have the whole dowry situation locked up,

105
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,786
我们现在还没够
{\fs12}and, um, we're not there just yet.

106
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,497
他们要求很多钱
{\fs12}They're asking for a lot of money,

107
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,875
我们捐钱给修道院
{\fs12}and, you know, with the money we're sending here,

108
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,711
还有你的修女们和她们的孩子 所以...
{\fs12}and then to your sisters and their children, it's a...

109
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,840
花掉很多钱 并没有那么多进账 所以
{\fs12}There's a lot of money going out and not that much coming in, so...

110
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,636
如果我们少捐给修道院
{\fs12}But maybe if we sent less money here to the convent,

111
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,221
就可以存钱
{\fs12}we could save it up,

112
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,633
我甚至可以和老爸老妈一起住
{\fs12}and I could even come and live with you and Mom and...

113
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,743
我不认为少捐钱是个好主意
{\fs12}I don't think sending less money here is a good idea,

114
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,978
因为 这会严重影响家庭
{\fs12}because, uh, that would reflect badly on the family.

115
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,482
我知道你渴望结婚 宝贝
{\fs12}But I know how eager you are to be married, my baby.

116
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,528
但也许 也许那不是你的使命
{\fs12}I know, but maybe it's... Maybe that's not your calling.

117
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,574
你的刺绣怎么样了?你还在做吗?
{\fs12}How's your embroidery going? You still doing that?

119
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,154
很好 因为你很擅长于此
{\fs12}Good, 'cause you're so good,

120
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,679
也许这是你的使命
{\fs12}and maybe that's your calling, you know.

121
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,934
有些人的使命 是婚姻和家庭 温暖的家
{\fs12}Some people, it's marriage and family and the warmth of a home,

122
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,293
也许你的使命 就是精细刺绣
{\fs12}and maybe for you it's... It's the detailed embroidery.

123
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,672
请扬起
{\fs12}You know, keep... Please.

124
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,423
扬起你的下巴
{\fs12}Keep your chin up.

125
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,035
给我 给我一点甜美的笑容
{\fs12}Give me... Give me a little sugar.

126
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,928
嘿 宝贝
{\fs12}Hey, hey, sweetie.

127
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,013
爸爸爱你
{\fs12}All right. Daddy loves you.

128
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,515
我爱你
{\fs12}I love you.

129
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,768
好吧 你保重
{\fs12}Okay. All right, you take care, and...

有潜在的求婚者吗?
{\fs12}Any potential suitors?

143
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,214
这不是他拜访的目的
{\fs12}That's not even what his visit was about.

144
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,692
我们都没谈过
{\fs12}We didn't even talk about that.

145
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,860
那他为何来访? 
{\fs12}Then what was his visit about?

146

{\fs12}This is a turnip.

153
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,372

{\fs12}Yeah, you are a disgusting piece of shit!

158
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,716
你觉得我们会吃这种食物吗?
{\fs12}Think we can just eat any of this food?

159
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,196
我们快饿死了 你什么都做不好
{\fs12}We're fucking starving! You can't do anything right!

160
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,248
看这面墙 看看你建造的东西
{\fs12}Look at this wall! Look at the stuff you build!

161
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,227

00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,975
你竟敢直视我们?
{\fs12}You think you can look at us?

165
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,125
你知道我父亲是谁吗?
{\fs12}You know who my father is?

166
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,460
他活该
{\fs12}Yes! He deserves this!

167
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,938
他付给你工资 却什么都做不好 你这小耗子
{\fs12}He pays you good money to do nothing, you little rat!

168
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,602
你这该死的小老鼠

{\fs12}Just hoarding all the food, huh, like a fucking Jew?

172
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,009
这就是你干的好事?
{\fs12}Is that what you're doing?

173
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,681
我们都快饿死了
{\fs12}We're all starving!

00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,105
太棒了 谁干的?
{\fs12}That's gorgeous. Who did that?

182
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,366
亚历山大修女
{\fs12}Sister Alessandra.

183
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,367
我们得多做点
{\fs12}We have to make more of that.

184
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,369
城里很畅销的
{\fs12}That'll go big in town.

185
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,413
告诉卢尔克 关好花园的门
{\fs12}Tell Lurco to keep that garden gate closed,

186
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,145
因为鹿会进来的
{\fs12}because the deer are getting into it.

187
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,331
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

188
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,204
我的朋友 
{\fs12}All right, my friend.

189
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,758
准备好出发了吗?准备好了吗?
{\fs12}Are you ready for a journey? Are you ready?

190
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,736
当树叶凋零
{\fs12}"Know when the leaf parts from the ash

191
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,263
树梢枯萎
{\fs12}"and the branches wizen in the treetop

192
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,183
树皮不再供给甜美的树液
{\fs12}"for through the bark, the sweet humor of the sap doesn't mount to them

193
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,688
鸟儿噤若寒蝉
{\fs12}"and the birds have fallen silent from their warbling

194
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,815
因为寒冷 攫取着他们
{\fs12}"because of the cold that grips them.

195
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,568
但是 我仍坚定不移
{\fs12}"But in spite of this all, I'm unshaken

196
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,153
因为我繁荣兴盛
{\fs12}"for I am rejuvenated and prosper

197
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,029
所有其他的幸福是白费
{\fs12}"when all the other happiness is wasted.

198
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,824
因为我所有的欢乐
{\fs12}"And if all my merriment is saddened

199
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,676
无需公开坦诚...
{\fs12}"to the point of not boasting openly..."

200
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,287
然而 它并没有阻止
{\fs12}"It hasn't however kept my praise

201
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,705
我的赞美...
{\fs12}"from gaining me..."

谁朝你吐口水? - 她们向我吐口水
{\fs12}Who spit on you? - They spit on me.

205

卢尔克 我得走了
{\fs12}Lurco, I have to leave.

206
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,758
我正要去市场卖织物 拜托
{\fs12}I'm about to leave to go to the market to sell the fabrics, please!

207
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,944
神父 我很抱歉 她们朝我吐口水
{\fs12}Father, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry. They spit on me.

208
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,261
她们叫我犹太人
{\fs12}They called me a Jew.

209
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,364
她们叫我犹太人 妥玛索神父 - 卢尔克 拜托你

211
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,684
求你了 就再多等两天吧
{\fs12}Please, just wait two days!

212
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,251
我觉得我们过的不错
{\fs12}I want to think we've had a nice life.

213
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,653
让你尽享
{\fs12}I think I surround you in a lifestyle

214
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,822
愉快和奢华的生活
{\fs12}that is pleasant and luxurious.

215
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,366
享用这野鸡吧
{\fs12}Enjoy this pheasant.

216
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,788
佛罗伦萨一旦被占据
{\fs12}Soon as Florence gets here,

217
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,208
我们只能吃鸡了 和该死的克罗地亚人一样
{\fs12}we'll be eating chicken like a bunch of fucking Croatians.

218
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,669
我派了另一个信使去佛罗伦萨
{\fs12}I sent another messenger to Florence.

219
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,087
信使回来了
{\fs12}Messenger came back.

220
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,256
他碰到教皇派士兵
{\fs12}He's dealing with the Guelph soldiers.

221
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,759
他占了佛罗伦萨 他占了阿雷佐
{\fs12}He's got Florence. He's got Arezzo.

222
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,345
他还没有占领比萨 但他会的
{\fs12}He doesn't have Pisa yet, but he will,

223
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,722
然后他就会来找我们
{\fs12}and then he's coming for us.

224
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,724
所以我派了信使去阿雷佐
{\fs12}So, I sent a messenger to Arezzo.

225
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,185
他不在阿雷佐
{\fs12}He's not in Arezzo.

226
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:31,990
他在比萨
{\fs12}He's in Pisa.

227
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,995
他要...他在百般勾引比萨
{\fs12}He's going... He's making a play for Pisa!

228
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,777
比萨还没到手 但他会的
{\fs12}He doesn't have Pisa yet, but he will.

229
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,279
他们很虚弱 像教皇派
{\fs12}They're weak, like the Guelphs.

230
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,866
你知道比萨之后是什么吗?卢卡
{\fs12}You know what comes after Pisa? Lucca.

231
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,785
目的是为了丝绸贸易
{\fs12}He's coming for our silk trade.

232
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,745

你的野鸡 你的小扁豆 好好享用吧 
{\fs12}your pheasant, your lentils. Live it up.

235
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:57,628
快结束了
{\fs12}It's coming to an end.

236
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,924
佛罗伦萨的阴谋论 
{\fs12}This... This Florentine conspiracy thing

237
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,360
言而总之
{\fs12}is getting to the point of, like,

238
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,111
他说了这么多 跟神经病一样
{\fs12}he talks about it so much, it's like a mental illness.

239
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,571
我会假装睡着
{\fs12}I'll be fake sleeping... - Mmm-hmm.

240
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,995
他还在继续说
{\fs12}And he's still going on about it.

241
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,449
"我们会失去一切" 
{\fs12}"We're gonna lose everything." - Mmm-hmm.

242
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,867
我倒是挺喜欢的
{\fs12}And that's what... I'm like... At this point, I'm like,

243
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,011
"我反倒希望如此 好让你闭嘴"
{\fs12}"You know what? I hope we do, just so you'll shut up."

244
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,520
闭嘴
{\fs12}Just shut up. - Mmm-hmm.

245
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,816
他认为一切都是他们造成的 
{\fs12}He thinks that everything that happens is because of them.

246
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,308
他废话连篇
{\fs12}Yeah, he says a lot of things.

247
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,779
他只是... 他的音调有多难听
{\fs12}He's just... Just, it's not... Even his tone is awful.

248
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,715
是吗?你以为我不受煎熬吗
{\fs12}Yeah? You act like I don't suffer through it, too.

249
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,575
我就在你旁边站着
{\fs12}I'm right there with you.

250
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,744
听起来像他
{\fs12}That sounded like him.

251
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,236
听起来像他
{\fs12}Hmm? - That sounded like him.

252
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,873
那不是他
{\fs12}No, no, that's not him.

253
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,708
他一直在睡觉 放松
{\fs12}He's always asleep. Just relax.

254
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,627
你真可爱
{\fs12}You're so cute.

255
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,799
我好像听到了... - 不
{\fs12}I felt like... I felt I heard the... - No, no.

256
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,424
那好 我们再做一次爱 帮你放松
{\fs12}All right, we're gonna fuck again. That'll help you relax.

257
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,925
不 就是他
{\fs12}No! That is him.

258
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,638
不 那是他
{\fs12}No! That's... That is him.

259
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,015
该死 该死
{\fs12}Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

260
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,478
你做了什么?
{\fs12}What have you done?

261
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,147
我做了什么?
{\fs12}Oh, what have I done?

262
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,150
外面有什么?教皇派吗?
{\fs12}Oh, what's out there? Is it the Guelphs?

263
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,694
是佛罗伦萨吗?他们会来吗?去抓他们
{\fs12}Is it Florence? Are they coming? Go get 'em!

264
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,321
我等下找你算账
{\fs12}I shall deal with you shortly.

265
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,865
我吓呆了
{\fs12}I'm petrified.

266
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,980
明早我就知道你是谁了
{\fs12}Now I'll know who you are in the morning.

267
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,315
咱私下解决
{\fs12}We'll settle this in private.

268
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,272
我告诉你们 100%
{\fs12}I'll tell you what happened, 100%.

269
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,834
我们睡觉的时候 恶魔进来切了我们的头发
{\fs12}A demon came in here while we were sleeping and cut our hair.

270
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,569
无法证明它不是恶魔 所以
{\fs12}There's no way to prove it's not a demon, so...

271
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,046
它就是恶魔
{\fs12}Which means that it was a demon.

272
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,190
不然是什么?术士吗?
{\fs12}What else was it? A warlock?

273
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:18,356
早上好
{\fs12}Good morning.

274
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,496
君主大人
{\fs12}My liege.

275
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,682
你们这些低下的狗
{\fs12}You common-born dogs.

276
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,605
有个蠢蛋自认为他是个宫廷小丑
{\fs12}One of you sluts thinks he's quite the jester.

277
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,068
你他妈的在看什么?
{\fs12}What the fuck are you looking at?

278
00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:54,979
我会操你呼吸的地方
{\fs12}I'll fuck you where you breathe.

279
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,580
那是怎么回事啊?
{\fs12}What was that all about, huh?

280
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,127
我看见那些教皇派冲进城里
{\fs12}I saw Guelph men rush into town...

281
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,672
野蛮的野兽 撕裂人体四肢
{\fs12}Savage beasts, tearing men from limb to limb.

282
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,717
我看到一个男人一靴子
{\fs12}I saw a little boy's head crushed between a...

283
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,137
踩爆了一个小男孩的头颅
{\fs12}A man's boot and... And a stone.

284
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,265
他的眼球掉了出来
{\fs12}His eyeballs came skittering across.

285
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:24,604
我看到了我漂亮的八岁妹妹 贝尼西亚
{\fs12}I saw my beautiful eight-year-old sister, Benicia,

286
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,900
被教皇派一剑劈成两半
{\fs12}cleaved in half with one swipe of a sword by the Guelphs.

287
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:33,113
她活到现在 会比你更漂亮
{\fs12}She was more beautifully developed as a woman than you are today.

288
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,407
你看到我铜色的头发吗?
{\fs12}You see this copper in my hair?

289
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,786
她全身的毛发 都是这种最美丽的颜色
{\fs12}She had the most beautiful hair of this color all over her body.

290
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,413
闭嘴 
{\fs12}Shut up.

291
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,308
别在餐桌上说了
{\fs12}Stop talking about this, not at the table, okay?

292
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,060
别再碎碎念眼球 压碎一类的屁话
{\fs12}No more eyeballs or squishing and all that kind of stuff.

293
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,812
我不想在餐桌上 再听到任何暴力事件
{\fs12}I don't want to hear about any more violence at the table,

294
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,396
因为我在用餐 我在消化 所以拜托
{\fs12}'cause I'm eating, and I'm digesting, so stop it.

295
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
闭嘴
{\fs12}Silence!

296
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,966
你怎么敢?
{\fs12}How dare you?

297
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,844
你很软弱
{\fs12}You are weak.

298
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,390
我怀疑 你的血管里流淌教皇派的血液
{\fs12}I've begun to suspect you have Guelph blood coursing through your veins.

299
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,935
你又怎么知道?
{\fs12}Oh, no. How did you find out?

300
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,480
今晚我会到你的卧房 带着魔鬼刺棒
{\fs12}I will bring the Devil's goad to your bedchamber this evening,

301
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,400
闪闪亮亮
{\fs12}and it will be freshly polished.

302
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,985
不
{\fs12}No.

303
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,437
我们再也不做了
{\fs12}We're not doing that anymore.

304
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,964
你放不进去
{\fs12}You're not putting anything in there.

305
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,048
也拿不出来
{\fs12}Nothing's coming out, nothing.

306
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,323
我们等着瞧
{\fs12}We'll see about that.

307
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,695
我不会再这样了
{\fs12}I'm not doing that anymore.

308
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,419
我要再来一发 - 不
{\fs12}I need a refill. - Don't.

309
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,714
请不要这样做
{\fs12}Oh. - Please don't do this.

310
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,692
我只需要一小发 
{\fs12}I just need a quick little refill. Come here.

311
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,925
过来 - 你疯了
{\fs12}Come here. - You're insane.

312
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:40,522
你太厉害了 - 停下 有人会抓住我们的
{\fs12}You've been so sweet to me. - Stop, stop. Somebody's gonna catch us!

313
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:42,357
听着 你会把我害死的
{\fs12}Look, look, you're gonna get me fuckin' killed! - Uh-huh.

314
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,307
如果有人抓住我
{\fs12}If someone catches me...

315
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,724
我不想弄疼你 
{\fs12}I don't want to hurt you! I don't want to hurt you!

316
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,203
那就脱掉你的裤子 脱
{\fs12}Take your pants off, then. - No, get off!

317
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,067
怎么这么多机关?
{\fs12}It's like, why are there so many folds in here?

318
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,109
妈的 该死
{\fs12}Shit. Oh, shit.

319
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,821
把他的蛋给我取下来
{\fs12}Bring me his goddamn balls.

320
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,741
妈的 该死
{\fs12}Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

321
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,953
天啊 你的树枝到处都是
{\fs12}God dang it! Your twigs are all over the place.

322
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,877
跟上没有
{\fs12}Keeping up? You keeping up?

323
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,438
你先去 - 不带你吗?
{\fs12}Just go without me! - Go without you?

324
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,462
我会到的
{\fs12}I'll get there.

325
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,966
马赛托 让我们先谈谈
{\fs12}Masseto, let's talk about this!

326
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,718
快停下
{\fs12}Just stop! Stop!

327
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,098
马赛托 快
{\fs12}Masseto, come on!

328
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,558
马赛托 拜托
{\fs12}Masseto, come on!

329
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,850
别跑了
{\fs12}No running!

330
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,311
马赛托
{\fs12}Masseto!

331
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:31,940
马赛托
{\fs12}Masseto!

332
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,437
不
{\fs12}Oh, no!

333
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,439
不
{\fs12}Oh, no!

334
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:25,502
不
{\fs12}No.

335
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,959
神父?
{\fs12}Father?

336
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,336
你离我远点 这些都是我的
{\fs12}You stay away! These are mine!

337
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,689
好像你...
{\fs12}No, it just looks like you...

338
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,833
你离我远点 东西是我的
{\fs12}You stay away! They're mine!

339
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:38,964
停下
{\fs12}Hey, stop! Stop!

340
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,508
我只是想帮你
{\fs12}I'm just trying to help you!

341
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,302
如果你是强盗 我就打你
{\fs12}If you're a bandit, I will strike you!

342
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,073
要么你丢了所有东西
{\fs12}You can either lose all of your stuff,

343
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,972
或者你可以相信我 让我帮你
{\fs12}or you can trust me and let me help you!

344
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,599
我被委托关照这些织物
{\fs12}I was entrusted to take care of these things,

345
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,310
我毁了这一切
{\fs12}and I've ruined this!

346
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,687
修女们做了一切
{\fs12}The sisters made all these things,

347
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,231
它们掉到水里了 - 没事的
{\fs12}and I've lost them in the water. - It's all right.

348
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,804
我倒了 - 没事 我会帮你的
{\fs12}And now I've fallen... - It's all right. I'm gonna help.

349
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,487
你没事吧?
{\fs12}Are you all right?

350
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,197
我醉了
{\fs12}I'm drunk!

351
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,575
我和车一起倒了
{\fs12}And I have fallen with my cart,

352
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,036
这只动物走错了方向
{\fs12}and this animal went the wrong way.

353
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,972
好了 别动
{\fs12}All right, all right, all right, all right, just stay down.

354
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,996
别起来
{\fs12}Stay down, please.

355
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,717
都在这里了
{\fs12}There. That's it. All right.

356
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,848
我希望能给你一些回报
{\fs12}I wish there was something I could give you in repayment.

357
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,744
我没有钱 或者酒 - 不 神父 我不需要钱或酒
{\fs12}I have no money. Or wine... - No, Father, I don't need any money, or wine.

358
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,228
没关系的
{\fs12}That's... That's totally fine. Yeah.

359
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,315
你确定不要报答吗?
{\fs12}Are you sure there's nothing I can do to repay you?

360
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,276
我不知道 如果你今晚有地方让我住
{\fs12}I don't know. If you maybe had a place for me to stay tonight,

361
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,235
我会很感激的
{\fs12}I would really appreciate it.

362
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,527
你无处可住?
{\fs12}You have nowhere to stay?

363
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,695
是的
{\fs12}No.

364
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,365
那你要跟我走
{\fs12}Oh, you're coming with me.

365
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,577
完全的灾难啊
{\fs12}It was a total disaster.

366
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,669
我不应该耗费时间和卢尔克理论
{\fs12}I never should have stopped to speak to Lurco.

367
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,289
结果我晚了
{\fs12}That's what's held me up.

368
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,000
到晚上才出发
{\fs12}And then I was out at night.

369
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,420
我喝了酒 因为我没有带水
{\fs12}I had to drink the wine, because I had no water.

370
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,256
喝着喝着我就醉了
{\fs12}And then I just didn't realize how drunk I was getting,

371
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,591
我丢了一切
{\fs12}and I've lost everything!

372
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,093
对不起 神父
{\fs12}I'm sorry, Father.

373
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,695
我希望我能做的更好
{\fs12}I wish there was more I could have done.

374
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,804
我要怎么解释啊?
{\fs12}How am I gonna explain?

375
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,180
不 没事的
{\fs12}No, no, it's all right.

376
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,099
你做了 你做了很多
{\fs12}You've done... You've done a lot.

377
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,399
给你新鲜的面包
{\fs12}Right, here you are. Fresh bread for you.

378
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,361
小心 慢点
{\fs12}Oh, careful. Go... Take it easy.

379
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,653
真的很好吃
{\fs12}It's really, really good.

380
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:30,618
对不起 我之前是如此...
{\fs12}Good, good. I'm... I'm sorry I was so...

381
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,206
兴奋和不安
{\fs12}Excited and upset before. I...

382
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,582
没关系
{\fs12}That's all right. That's...

383
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,877
你想喝点酒吗?
{\fs12}Would you like some wine?

384
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,046
喝个底朝天
{\fs12}Bottom up. Up.

385
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,298
干了
{\fs12}Up! Uh-uh...

386
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,095
我没用手
{\fs12}I didn't touch it.

387
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,643
这真是太棒了
{\fs12}This has been wonderful.

388
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,935
太棒了 
{\fs12}Too wonderful.

389
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,103
多好的祝福啊
{\fs12}What a blessing!

390
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,875
我受到的最好祝福 - 你救了我
{\fs12}The best blessing I have ever experienced. - You saved me!

391
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,734
是你救了我 开什么玩笑?
{\fs12}You saved me! Are you kidding?

392
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,611
我没开玩笑
{\fs12}I'm not kidding.

393
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,196
我没救你
{\fs12}I didn't save you.

394
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,907
我一个人 不能把驴车的轮子装回去
{\fs12}I couldn't put it... The wheel of the donkey cart back on.

395
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,245
上帝保佑我 神父 因为我有罪
{\fs12}Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

396
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:18,166
已经好几年了
{\fs12}It has been years,

397
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,376
距离我上次忏悔已经有很多年了
{\fs12}many years since my last confession.

398
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,378
我的罪过是
{\fs12}Hmm. - Here are my sins.

399
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,589
我睡了人妻
{\fs12}I have slept with another man's wife.

400
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:28,426
他是贵族 他是我的主人
{\fs12}He's a nobleman, and he is my master.

401
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,760
那是通奸
{\fs12}Well, that's adultery.

402
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,096
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

403
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,389
这是很严重的罪过
{\fs12}It's a very serious sin.

404
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,682
有时
{\fs12}Sometimes...

405
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:40,605
她会把嘴巴放在我的性器上
{\fs12}She would place her mouth around my sex.

406
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,608
那是鸡奸
{\fs12}Well, that's sodomy.

407
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,402
又一个严重的罪过
{\fs12}It's also a serious sin.

408
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,447
那也是鸡奸了 如果
{\fs12}Is it also considered sodomy if...

409
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:54,744
如果我把嘴放在她的性器上
{\fs12}If I placed my mouth on her sex while...

410
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,372
我们俩同时进行的
{\fs12}She simultaneously had... Had her mouth around mine?

411
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,626
你为什么要这么做?
{\fs12}Why would you do that?

412
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,087
因为她喜欢
{\fs12}Because she... She liked it.

413
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,379
喔
{\fs12}Oh.

414
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,762
对 那也是鸡奸
{\fs12}Well, yes, that's also sodomy.

415
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,932
我以为鸡奸是
{\fs12}I thought sodomy was... Was just when I would...

416
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:20,019
穿过后庭花
{\fs12}When someone would penetrate the rear... The rear end.

417
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:24,440
没错 那也是鸡奸
{\fs12}Yes, that's... That's also sodomy.

418
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,986
传统的鸡奸 - 好吧
{\fs12}That's the traditional form of sodomy. - Right.

419
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,446
你干了?
{\fs12}Did you do that?

420
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,866
是我干的 确实发生了
{\fs12}I... I did. Yes, I... That also occurred.

421
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,998
但你没有把种子洒在后庭花?
{\fs12}But you didn't spill your seed in the rear end?

422
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,245
不 我没有
{\fs12}No, no, I did not.

423
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,579
很好 很好
{\fs12}Good, good.

424
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,290
我会把种子洒在她身上
{\fs12}I would spill my seed on her... Um...

425
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,794
比如背部或双峰
{\fs12}On her back or on her bosom.

426
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,256
但大多数时候 她会要求
{\fs12}But most of the time, she would request

427
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,675
颜射
{\fs12}that I spill my seed all over her face.

428
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,222
好吧
{\fs12}Well...

429
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,642
这些都是严重的罪过
{\fs12}These are serious sins.

430
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,145
你后悔吗?
{\fs12}And do you regret doing these things?

431
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,523
我已经吸取了教训 真的
{\fs12}I've learned my lesson, I really have.

432
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,895
我只是 我不想再当那个人了
{\fs12}And I just... I don't want to be that person anymore.

433
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,361
如果我回去 他们会抓住我
{\fs12}If I go back out on the road, they will catch me,

434
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,737
他们会杀了我
{\fs12}and they will kill me.

435
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,741
好吧 我给你忏悔
{\fs12}Well, I'll give you your penance.

436
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,703
你念10遍万福玛利亚 - 是
{\fs12}I want you to say. - Yeah.

437
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:19,995
还有15遍天父
{\fs12}And 15 Our Fathers.

438
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,497
是
{\fs12}Yes.

439
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,457
现在 至于其他情况
{\fs12}Now, as to the other situation

440
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,627
你被追捕的事
{\fs12}about you being pursued,

441
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,465
我想我可能有解决方案
{\fs12}I think I may have a solution

442
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,634
这对我们两个人都是个祝福
{\fs12}that can be a blessing to both of us.

443
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,303
谢谢你 神父 谢谢
{\fs12}Yes, thank you, Father. Thank you.

444
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,310
早上好 玛利亚 - 早上好
{\fs12}Good morning, Marea. - Good morning.

445
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:43,978
现在有空吗? - 是
{\fs12}Is it a good time? - Yes.

446
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,390
我给你介绍一下 这是马赛托
{\fs12}I'd like to introduce you to someone. This is Masseto.

447
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,525
他是个聋哑人
{\fs12}He's a deaf-mute. - Oh.

448
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,861
我外出时遇到他 和他的家人交谈过
{\fs12}I met him on my trip and spoke to his family,

449
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,193
他们向我解释说 他非常擅长园艺 轻木工
{\fs12}and they explained to me that he's very good with gardening, light carpentry.

450
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,283
我想他可以帮我们修葺修道院
{\fs12}I think he could help us repair the cloister

451
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,375
接手所有卢尔克的活儿
{\fs12}and do all of the things that Lurco was doing.

452
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,495
既然他是个聋哑人
{\fs12}And I thought the fact that he's a deaf-mute,

453
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,040
与修女们的冲突将会少很多
{\fs12}there would be a lot less conflicts with the sisters.

454
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,459
真不敢相信你外出遇到了聋哑人
{\fs12}I can't believe you met a deaf-mute on your trip.

455
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,711
外出怎么样?织物卖掉了吗?
{\fs12}How was your trip? Did you sell any fabrics?

456
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,588
我们应该私下谈谈
{\fs12}We should talk about it in private.

457
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,120
反正他是聋哑人嘛
{\fs12}But you said he was a deaf-mute.

458
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,634
对
{\fs12}Right. Um...

459
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,095
我被抢了
{\fs12}I was robbed.

460
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,388
你受伤了吗?没有 
{\fs12}Were you hurt?

461
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
我很好
{\fs12}No, no, no. I'm fine.

462
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,744
我没有受伤 但强盗夺走了一切
{\fs12}I wasn't hurt, but the bandits took everything.

463
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,913
他们抢走了所有的刺绣和丝绸 
{\fs12}They took all the embroidery, all of the silk,

464
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,022
所以我没有卖掉
{\fs12}so I made no sale.

465
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,314
我空手回来了 对不起
{\fs12}I've come back empty-handed. I'm sorry.

466
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,996
我能说什么呢?虽然我很尴尬 
{\fs12}What can I say? I'm very embarrassed, but...

467
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,530
但是算了
{\fs12}It's gonna be fine.

468
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,051
不要担心太多 我会让他开始工作的
{\fs12}All right. Don't worry too much about it. I'll get him started.

469
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,159
我们走
{\fs12}We go. We go.

470
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,498
你好
{\fs12}Hi.

471
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,505
你是谁?
{\fs12}Who are you?

472
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,217
我是吉尼芙拉修女
{\fs12}I'm Sister Ginevra.

473
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,511
你在做什么?
{\fs12}What are you doing?

474
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,726
你在挖沟?
{\fs12}You're digging a ditch?

475
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,145
你在挖沟
{\fs12}You're digging a ditch.

476
00:28:58,988 --> 00:28:59,988
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

477
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,746
因为上帝是完美的
{\fs12}Since God is perfect,

478
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:11,584
我们的工作是 与他"精神的实在"和谐相处
{\fs12}it's our job to live in unison with His essence.

479
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:16,338
但有时很难找到幸福
{\fs12}But sometimes it's difficult to find that happiness

480
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,841
事情不像我们想的那样
{\fs12}and things don't go our way.

481
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,678
我们觉得我们被惩罚了 而不是...
{\fs12}And we feel like we're being punished, and it's not...

482
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,932
谢谢你 费尔南达修女 谢谢
{\fs12}Thank you, Sister Fernanda. Thank you.

483
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,224
当然
{\fs12}Of course.

485
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,858
但是上帝 上帝是完美的
{\fs12}But God... God is... Is perfect.

486
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,779
费尔南达 够了
{\fs12}Fernanda! That's enough!

487
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,656
什么?  - 这是
{\fs12}What? - This is...

488
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,548
维欧拉 进去读完你的书
{\fs12}Viola, go inside and finish your reading.

489
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,287
停下
{\fs12}Stop it! Stop that!

490
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,122
你在做什么?
{\fs12}What are you doing?

491
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,750
我说了住手 够了
{\fs12}I said stop that! That is enough!

492
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,251
你今天怎么了? 
{\fs12}What's gotten into you today?

493
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,753
没什么 我很抱歉
{\fs12}Nothing. I'm so sorry.

494
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,483
我去清理粪便或擦洗地窖
{\fs12}You know what? I'll just go scoop some dung or scrub the cellars...

495
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,776
我不知道这算什么意思
{\fs12}I don't know where this is coming from!

496
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,440
免得你进来的时候 打扰到你
{\fs12}And not bother you while you walk in...

497
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:17,942
他刚才对你笑了吗?
{\fs12}Did he just smile at you?

498
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,234
我不知道
{\fs12}I don't know.

499
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,800
他为什么笑?那是谁?等等
{\fs12}Why is he smiling? Who is that? Wait!

500
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
你他妈的是谁?
{\fs12}Who the fuck are you?

501
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,823
你是谁?
{\fs12}Who are you?

502
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,115
你是谁?
{\fs12}Who are you?

503
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,534
费尔南达 住手
{\fs12}Fernanda, stop!

504
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,678
他是个不速之客 我不知道他到底是谁
{\fs12}He's an intruder. I don't know who the fuck he is!

505
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:29,702
我去喊玛利亚院长
{\fs12}Let me get Mother Marea!

506
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,205
好 去吧
{\fs12}Fine! Go!

507
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,539
说你是谁
{\fs12}Tell me who you are.

508
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,001
什么 说点什么
{\fs12}What? Say something!

509
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,337
你从哪里来?搞什么鬼?
{\fs12}Where did you come from? What is that?

510
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,989
你这鸡爪疯干什么的?
{\fs12}What are you doing with your hands?

511
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,591
干嘛 你饿了吗?
{\fs12}What? What, are you hungry?

512
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,802
那是什么 鸟吗?你在祈祷?
{\fs12}What is that, a bird? You're praying?

513
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,595
你他妈的在跟我说什么?
{\fs12}What the fuck are you saying to me?

514
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,180
他妈的告诉我你是谁
{\fs12}Fucking tell me who you are!

515
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,974
别砍他的头
{\fs12}Don't chop his head off!

516
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,226
他是马赛托 他是聋哑人 为我们工作
{\fs12}He's Masseto! He's a deaf-mute! He works for us!

517
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,270
妥玛索神父雇了他
{\fs12}Father Tommasso hired him.

518
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,188
很抱歉 我没告诉你
{\fs12}I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

519
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
你总是抱怨卢尔克和你说话
{\fs12}You're always complaining about how Lurco talks to you,

520
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,234
马赛托不说话
{\fs12}and Masseto doesn't talk.

521
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,446
所以 我真的希望你给他一个机会
{\fs12}So, I would really like you to give him a chance.

522
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:04,988
拜托
{\fs12}Please!

523
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,658
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

524
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,950
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

525
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,580
修女 我要和你谈谈
{\fs12}And, Sister, I need to speak to you.

526
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,003
你现在可以起来了
{\fs12}You can get up now!

527
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:21,498
他听不见
{\fs12}He can't hear you.

528
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:22,798
你为什么要为他辩护?
{\fs12}Why are you defending him?

529
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,468
现在
{\fs12}Now!

530
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,639
妥玛索神父被一群强盗袭击
{\fs12}Father Tommasso was attacked by a group of bandits, and...

531
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:32,765
不 - 他...
{\fs12}No. - He...

532
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,895
所有的刺绣都被偷了
{\fs12}Well, all the embroidery was stolen.

533
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:45,112
所以我所做的一切 都消失了吗?
{\fs12}So everything I've done, everything I've worked on, is gone?

534
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,574
恐怕就是这样了
{\fs12}Yes, I'm afraid that's what happened.

535
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,956
你没事吧?
{\fs12}Are you all right?

536
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,374
没事
{\fs12}Yeah.

537
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,459
只是...
{\fs12}It's...

538
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,379
我知道这很难...
{\fs12}I know this is a lot to...

539
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,256
吞下这口气
{\fs12}To swallow.

540
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,094
我会很高兴 派人
{\fs12}I'd be more than happy to get you

541
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:13,015
与你一起干 需要加倍努力
{\fs12}extra help for the work, which will be doubled

542
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,018
才能弥补失去的一切
{\fs12}to make up for everything that was lost.

543
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,187
你好?
{\fs12}Hello?

544
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,444
你好
{\fs12}Hi.

545
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:53,550
我弄坏了这个
{\fs12}Um, I broke this.

546
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,534
你能
{\fs12}Can you...

547
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,161
修好它吗?
{\fs12}Fix this, yes?

548
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:01,081
你的眼睛真和蔼
{\fs12}You've... Really kind eyes.

549
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,002
抱歉把这个给你
{\fs12}Sorry to just spring this on you.

550
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,896
因为刺绣都是我的事
{\fs12}It's only 'cause they just sprang it on me.

551
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,006
她们就知道让我加倍生产
{\fs12}You know, they just asked me to double production

552
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,924
莫名奇妙的刺绣
{\fs12}of my embroidery out of nowhere.

553
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,676
我基本上是单干
{\fs12}And I'm basically doing it alone.

554
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,362
她们说 给我协助
{\fs12}They told me that they would give me help,

555
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,822
然后 派给我的是
{\fs12}and then they just stuck me with this...

556
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,725
一个干瘪的老女人
{\fs12}This, like, shriveled up, old, comatose woman.

557
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,144
而且 我看着她 我觉得
{\fs12}And, you know, I look at her, and I just...

558
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,436
看到了我自己
{\fs12}I see me.

559
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,189
那就是我的未来
{\fs12}That's what I'm gonna become.

560
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,982
我会废在这里
{\fs12}I'm just gonna waste away here.

561
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,198
这可不是我的梦想
{\fs12}This is not what I imagined for myself, you know.

562
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,242
你在做什么?
{\fs12}What are you doing?

563
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,620
你为什么像动物一样躲在杂草里?
{\fs12}Why are you hiding in the weeds like an animal?

564
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,872
我刚看到亚历山大修女走进工具间
{\fs12}I just saw Sister Alessandra go into the toolshed.

565
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,751
但我知道 他没有攒钱给里卡多
{\fs12}But I know he is not saving up money for merchant Ricardo.

566
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,753
这根本不是他的错
{\fs12}This is like... It's not even his fault.

567
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,089
世界上任何地方都没有希望
{\fs12}There's just no hope anywhere in the world.

568
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,758
如此的悲伤和压抑
{\fs12}It's so sad and depressing.

569
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,593
我们任何人都没有希望
{\fs12}There's no hope for any of us.

570
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,678
是啊 看看你
{\fs12}Yes, look at you.

571
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,265
看看你 你不能说话 你听不到 这不公平
{\fs12}Look at you. You can't speak. You can't hear. It's not fair!

572
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,392
你只是被这些烂事缠住了
{\fs12}You're just stuck here with all these bitches,

573
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,684
我也是
{\fs12}and so am I!

574
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,314
我都不知道该怎么办
{\fs12}I just don't even know what to do!

575
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,024
太不公平了
{\fs12}It's so unfair.

576
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,373
她他妈的在里面干什么?
{\fs12}What the fuck is she doing in there?

577
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,408
我不知道
{\fs12}I have no idea.

578
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,125
让我们祈祷
{\fs12}Let us pray.

579
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,961
主啊 让我们的身体安息吧
{\fs12}Lord, give our bodies restful sleep

580
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,522
让我们今天所做的工作
{\fs12}and let our work we have done today

581
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,006
是为永恒的收获而播种
{\fs12}be sown for an eternal harvest

582
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,050
通过基督 我们的主
{\fs12}through Christ, our Lord.

583
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,552
阿门
{\fs12}Amen.

584
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:40,264
主啊 给我们安静的夜晚 完美的结束 阿门
{\fs12}Lord, grant us a quiet night and a perfect end. Amen.

585
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,854
上帝保佑我 神父 因为我有罪
{\fs12}Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

586
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,106
距离我上次忏悔已经三天了
{\fs12}It has been three days since my last confession.

587
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,608
你想忏悔什么?
{\fs12}And what is it you would like to confess?

588
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,363
昨天 我走过花园
{\fs12}Yesterday, I walked by the garden,

589
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,133
我挑了个萝卜 全吃了
{\fs12}and I picked a turnip and I ate the whole thing,

590
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,637
我没有和修女们分享
{\fs12}and I didn't share it with my sisters.

591
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:04,348
你后悔吗?
{\fs12}Hmm, and you regret this?

592
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,290
是的 神父
{\fs12}Yes, Father.

593
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,262
因为贪婪 不是吗?
{\fs12}Because it was greedy, wasn't it?

594
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,585
是 神父
{\fs12}It was, Father. - Hmm.

595
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,337
还有别的吗?
{\fs12}Anything else?

596
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:15,631
有 神父
{\fs12}Yes, Father.

597
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,470
我的动机不纯
{\fs12}I've been having impure thoughts.

599
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,039
你有没有对这些动机采取行动?
{\fs12}And have you acted on these thoughts?

600
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,517
没有 神父
{\fs12}No, Father.

601
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,523
上帝保佑我 神父 因为我有罪
{\fs12}Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

602
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,276
距离我上次忏悔已经两天了
{\fs12}It's been two days since my last confession.

603
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,208
你想忏悔什么?
{\fs12}And what do you wish to confess?

604
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,114
有一天 我在花园里发现了一个萝卜
{\fs12}The other day, I found a turnip in the garden

605
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,949
我一个人吃掉了
{\fs12}and I ate it all by myself,

606
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,743
我没有和修女们分享
{\fs12}and I didn't share it with my sisters.

607
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,915
它是如此美味 - 修女
{\fs12}And it was so delicious... - Sister.

608
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,124
吉尼芙拉刚跟我说了同样的故事
{\fs12}Ginevra just told me the same story.

609
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,696
你听过她的忏悔?
{\fs12}Did you overhear her confession?

610
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:54,754
没有
{\fs12}No.

611
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,593
好
{\fs12}Fine.

612
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,386
你还有什么要忏悔的吗?
{\fs12}Do you have anything else to confess?

613
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,931
我没有别的要忏悔的了
{\fs12}No. I have nothing else to confess.

614
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,326
你错过了朝赞课 修女
{\fs12}Well, you missed Lauds, Sister. That's something.

615
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,111
那是因为驴子跑到树林里 我救了她
{\fs12}Well, that's because the donkey escaped in the woods, and I saved her.

616
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,604
你应该感谢我 神父
{\fs12}You should be thanking me, Father.

617
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,273
听着 我正要
{\fs12}Look, I'm just gonna...

618
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,653
我不知道该怎么做
{\fs12}I don't know what to do here.

619
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,905
如果你不忏悔 上帝不能原谅你 
{\fs12}If you don't confess, God can't forgive you, so...

620
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:23,284
我没什么可忏悔的
{\fs12}I have nothing to confess.

621
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,718
好吧 那就去考虑一下你做了什么
{\fs12}All right. Well, just go and think about what you've done.

622
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,542
我们下周再试一次 - 是 神父
{\fs12}Let's try it again next week. - Yes, Father.

623
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,905
第一天
{\fs12}First day.

624
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,463
第一天 谢谢
{\fs12}First day. Thank you.

625
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,465
你活下来了
{\fs12}You survived.

627
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,594
过得怎么样?
{\fs12}How's it going?

628
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,126
没什么 所有的工作都很顺利
{\fs12}Yeah, no... All the work itself, it went really smoothly.

629
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,105
我在修道院做了很多工作
{\fs12}And I did a lot of great work in the cloister,

630
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,351
那很好
{\fs12}and that was good.

631
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:54,147
我遇到了一些修女 她们
{\fs12}And I met a few of the... The sisters, and they were...

632
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,067
她们是 非常有趣
{\fs12}They were... They were, you know, very interesting.

633
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,199
只是感激 感激来到这里 所以
{\fs12}And just grateful... Grateful to be here, so...

634
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,657
这些女孩可不好对付 我不打算撒谎
{\fs12}These girls can be tough. I'm not gonna lie.

635
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,534
她们可能非常强硬 - 真的?
{\fs12}They can be very tough. - Really?

636
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,826
还有暴力
{\fs12}And violent.

637
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,578
暴力?我...
{\fs12}Violence? I...

638
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,248
我觉得很难相信
{\fs12}Wow, I just... I find that so hard to believe.

639
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,684
她们太可爱了
{\fs12}They were... They were so lovely.

640
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:16,086
她们会攻击人身
{\fs12}They physically have attacked people.

641
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,755
如果发生什么事 就告诉我
{\fs12}So, if anything happens, just tell me.

642
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,215
我
{\fs12}Yeah. I...

643
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,552
不管什么 我都能修好 但你得告诉我
{\fs12}Whatever it is, I can fix it, but you have to tell me.

646
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,642
远离修女
{\fs12}And to keep the sisters away from you.

647
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,644
因为她们抱有远大理想
{\fs12}'Cause they can have a pack mentality.

648
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,397
最终 是一股正气

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,849
太快了
{\fs12}That's too fast.

778
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,852
太快了 我们应该停止
{\fs12}That's too fast. We should stop.

779
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:55,980
抱歉
{\fs12}Sorry.

780
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,776
抱歉 对不起
{\fs12}Sorry. I'm sorry.

781
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,152
好吧
{\fs12}Okay.

782
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:03,612
再见
{\fs12}Bye.

783
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,621
荣耀归与神
{\fs12}Glory to God in the highest,

784
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,706
世上 和平只给善意的人
{\fs12}and on Earth, peace to people of good will.

785
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:17,919
我们赞美你 我们祝福你
{\fs12}We praise you. We bless you.

我们崇拜你 我们赞美你
{\fs12}We adore you. We glorify you.

787
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,342
我们感谢您的伟大荣耀 主啊 上帝
{\fs12}We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God.

788
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,719
神啊 全能的天父啊
{\fs12}Heavenly King, O God, Almighty Father...

789
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,316
昨晚很好
{\fs12}Last night was nice.

790
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,322
你累了吗?
{\fs12}Are you tired?

791
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:48,407
是
{\fs12}Yeah.

792
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,577
我也是
{\fs12}Yeah, me too.

793
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,162
你感觉还好吧?
{\fs12}You feel okay?

794
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,454
我感觉不舒服 
{\fs12}No, I don't feel good.

795
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,833
我很开心
{\fs12}I had fun.

796
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,245
我说我感觉不舒服 你能不能别再说了?
{\fs12}I said I don't feel good. Can you please stop talking?

797
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,671
好吧
{\fs12}Well, okay.

798
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,174
嗨 女士们
{\fs12}Hi, ladies.

799
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,210
你们在这里干什么?
{\fs12}What are you doing here?

800
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,724
我刚好路过
{\fs12}Um, I was just in the neighborhood.

801
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,143
什么?
{\fs12}What?

802
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:17,061
我开玩笑的
{\fs12}I'm kidding.

803
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,939
我的面纱有点脏了
{\fs12}No, my veil just got a little dirty,

804
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,609
我知道你们俩在这里
{\fs12}and I knew you girls were here,

805
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,694
我想我来看看
{\fs12}and I thought I'd come visit

806
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,195
和你们一起洗
{\fs12}and wash it with you guys.

807
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:27,767
你要洗自己的面纱?
{\fs12}You're gonna wash your own veil?

808
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,869
为什么不呢?
{\fs12}Yeah. Why not?

809
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,162
你什么都不洗的
{\fs12}You never wash anything.

810
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,499
昨晚不是很有趣吗?
{\fs12}Wasn't last night so fun?

811
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:39,951
你的面纱怎么会这么脏?
{\fs12}How'd your veil get so dirty?

813
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,050
我刚才在花园里
{\fs12}Well, earlier I was in the garden,

814
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,594
新来的杂工在那里挖沟
{\fs12}and the new handyman was there digging a ditch,

815
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,596
我只是想帮他 
{\fs12}and I just thought I'd help him out.

816
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:52,888
你挖沟?
{\fs12}You dug a ditch?

817
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,600
实际上 真的很有趣
{\fs12}It was actually... It was really fun.

818
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,018
我该怎么办?
{\fs12}So, what do I do?

819
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,562
只需要泡在水里?
{\fs12}Do I just dip it in the... In the water?

820
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:00,854
这里
{\fs12}It's so... Ooh, it's...

821
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:02,941
这里真的很脏
{\fs12}It's really dirty over here.

822
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,611
首先你把它放进水里
{\fs12}First you put it in the water,

823
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:09,322
然后你放在灰碗里
{\fs12}and then you bring it over to the bowl that has the ash.

824
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,675
放进去 然后把灰撒在上面
{\fs12}And you put it in the bowl, and you put the ash on top of it,

825
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,019
然后过一天
{\fs12}and then you let it sit for a day.

826
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,744
第二天回来
{\fs12}So then tomorrow, you would come back

827
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,329
从碗里拿出来
{\fs12}and take it out of the bowl,

828
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:17,681
水里冲洗一下
{\fs12}and then you rinse it really well in the water...

829
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,745
然后拧干
{\fs12}And then you wring it out,

830
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,416
挂在杆子上
{\fs12}and then you hang it up on the line.

831
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,628
听起来 你真的很擅长
{\fs12}Sounds like you are really good at this...

832
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,964
所以 也许我...
{\fs12}So, maybe I'll just...

833
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,507
还是留给你好了
{\fs12}I'll leave it here with you.

834
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,634
太棒了
{\fs12}This was great.

835
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,469
谢谢 再见 姑娘们
{\fs12}Thank you. Bye, you guys.

836
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:32,762
再见
{\fs12}Bye.

837
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:36,387
我想我会洗到死的
{\fs12}Guess I would have ended up washing this eventually.

838
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,689
这个也洗掉
{\fs12}Here. Finish this.

839
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:44,273
我得去把地窖收拾一下
{\fs12}I have to go tidy up the cellar.

840
00:49:58,621 --> 00:49:59,621
在这里
{\fs12}Here it is.

841
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,353
应该够了
{\fs12}Yeah, there should be enough here.

842
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,972
费尔南达修女?
{\fs12}Sister Fernanda?

843
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,941
记住不要放进嘴里
{\fs12}Just have to remember not to get this in your mouth, okay?

844
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,234
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

845
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,118
脱掉修女装
{\fs12}Take off the nun thing.

846
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,690
你会撒的到处都是
{\fs12}You'll get it all over it.

847
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,766
准备好了吗? -嗯
{\fs12}Okay, you ready? - Yeah.

848
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,128
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

849
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,062
来吧
{\fs12}Go for it.

850
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,874
只是
{\fs12}Just going to...

851
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,919
让你看起来
{\fs12}Make you look a little more...

852
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:29,212
更漂亮点
{\fs12}Presentable.

853
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,300
照我说的做
{\fs12}Do exactly what I tell you to do.

854
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:53,486
确保他看到你的眼睛
{\fs12}Make sure he sees your eyes.

855
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,281
好的 吻他
{\fs12}Okay, kiss him.

856
00:51:58,658 --> 00:51:59,951
吻他
{\fs12}Kiss him.

857
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:02,954
快
{\fs12}Come on.

858
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,061
好 靠近点
{\fs12}Okay, get closer.

859
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,553
小心刀子
{\fs12}Careful with the knife.

860
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,691
全含进去
{\fs12}Take it all in.

861
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,198
好
{\fs12}Okay.

862
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,874
到他上面去
{\fs12}Get on top of him.

863
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,751
把你的性器顶在他胃部
{\fs12}Push your sex into his stomach.

864
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,626
好了
{\fs12}All right.

865
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,004
他能干
{\fs12}He'll do.

866
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,241
你们在里面做什么?
{\fs12}What were you doing in there?

867
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,265
你好
{\fs12}Hi.

868
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,517
你从哪里来?
{\fs12}Where'd you come from?

869
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:51,854
我只是在摘根菜
{\fs12}I was just picking root vegetables.

870
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,900
你真的是从格塔纳纳来的吗?
{\fs12}Are you really from Gartagnana?

871
00:53:56,192 --> 00:53:58,527
对 我真的来自格塔纳纳
{\fs12}Yes, I'm really from Gartagnana.

872
00:53:58,819 --> 00:53:59,904
你为什么一直问我?
{\fs12}Why do you keep asking me?

873
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,316
你问过我 25次了
{\fs12}You've asked me, like, 25...

874
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:02,529
你真烦人
{\fs12}You are the most annoying!

875
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,745
你不理我了吗?
{\fs12}Are you ignoring me?

876
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,498
不
{\fs12}No.

877
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,510
我觉得你不理我了 - 我没有
{\fs12}I feel like you're ignoring me. - I'm not.

878
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,129
我能问你一个问题吗?
{\fs12}Can I ask you a question?

879
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,047
说
{\fs12}Yes.

880
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,301
昨晚对你有什么意义吗?
{\fs12}Did last night mean anything to you?

881
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,763
没有
{\fs12}No.

882
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:27,974
我们只是喝醉了 玩得很开心
{\fs12}We were just drunk and having fun.

883
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,476
忘记了吧
{\fs12}Forget about it.

884
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,571
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

885
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,740
马赛托
{\fs12}Masseto, Masseto, Masseto.

886
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,409
我实际上
{\fs12}I'm actually...

887
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:47,827
我现在很好
{\fs12}I'm all right right now.

888
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,161
好吧
{\fs12}Oh, all right.

890
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,747
过得怎么样?
{\fs12}How's it going?

891
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,207
今天是个好日子
{\fs12}It was a good day.

892
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,084
我
{\fs12}Yeah, I um...

893
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,044
我不知道 我可以
{\fs12}I don't know. I can kind of...

894
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,714
我能在这里待一阵子
{\fs12}I can kind of picture myself maybe being here a while.

895
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,924
真的?你能留下来?
{\fs12}Really? You think you could stay on?

896
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,093
只要你允许
{\fs12}If you'd have me, yeah.

897
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,678
开什么玩笑?
{\fs12}Are you kidding?

898
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,097
这将解决很多问题
{\fs12}That would solve a lot of problems.

899
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:10,641
和修女们怎么样?还行吗?
{\fs12}And how's it going with the sisters? That's all right?

900
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,727
我觉得她们在为我热身
{\fs12}I think they're kind of warming up to me.

901
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,062
很好 没有过分?
{\fs12}Good. Good, good. Not too much?

902
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,897
不 绝对
{\fs12}No. Definitely...

903
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,190
绝对没有过分
{\fs12}Definitely not too much.

904
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,359
刚刚好的感觉
{\fs12}It's the right amount, feels like.

905
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,611
不管怎样 让我们举杯吧
{\fs12}Anyway, let's have a toast,

906
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,072
快速敬酒
{\fs12}just a quick toast...

907
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,884
然后忏悔
{\fs12}And then maybe head over to confession.

908
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:31,471
就像我们一直那样
{\fs12}Yeah. - You know, like we do.

909
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:31,763
我想今晚不用 我感觉有点累
{\fs12}I think I'm good tonight, just 'cause I'm gonna... Feeling a little tired.

910
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,098
今天真是漫长的一天 - 好的
{\fs12}It's been a long day. - All right, yeah.

911
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,058
但把酒倒回去 要倒霉的
{\fs12}It's bad luck to put it back in the pitcher, though...

912
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,682
所以 我们就喝这点 然后...
{\fs12}So, let's just have this one, and then...

913
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,387
你好?
{\fs12}Hello?

914
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,390
你独自一人吗?
{\fs12}Are you alone?

915
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,201
当然 - 好像听到有人
{\fs12}Of course. - I thought I heard someone.

916
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,227
不 我在自言自语
{\fs12}No, no, no. I was talking to myself.

917
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,271
我们出去走会儿
{\fs12}Let's take a little walk.

918
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,327
巴托洛梅奥主教 你好

{\fs12}Come in. Come in. Come in. - Hello.

923
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,134
我来拿 你一定累坏了
{\fs12}Here. Let me take this. You must be exhausted.

924
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,458
非常累 很长的旅程
{\fs12}Very tired, very long trip.

925
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,629
见到你真好
{\fs12}So good to see you.

926
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,048
我也很高兴见到你
{\fs12}So good to see you, too.

927
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,340
有点出乎意料
{\fs12}Somewhat unexpected.

928
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:26,801
看起来不错
{\fs12}Looks great.

929
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:29,678
都准备好了
{\fs12}We'll get it together for you.

930
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,514
我相信你们
{\fs12}Oh, yes, I'm sure you will.

931
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,200
妈的
{\fs12}Oh, shit!

932
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,482
笃笃笃 她们不在这里吗?
{\fs12}Knock-knock. Are they not here?

933
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,001
她们消失了
{\fs12}They disappeared. - Oh.

934
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,402
你认识亚历山大·伊拉里欧的女儿吗?
{\fs12}And you know Alessandra, Ilario's daughter?

935
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:09,854
当然是伊拉里欧的女儿 
{\fs12}Ilario's daughter, of course.

936
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,447
你好
{\fs12}Hi.

937
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,259
他的生意目前不太好 - 太糟糕了
{\fs12}His business is not doing very well at the moment. - Oh, that's terrible.

938
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,283
很抱歉这么说
{\fs12}Sorry to say, yeah.

940
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:17,744
我想要一条
{\fs12}I want one of those.

941
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,038
我们可以给你一条  
{\fs12}We can get you one.

942
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,450
都是你的
{\fs12}Yes, it's yours, it's yours!

943
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,684
谢谢你 亚历山大修女 - 谢谢
{\fs12}Thank you, Sister Alessandra. - Thank you.

944
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,060
很高兴见到你 - 感谢您的时间
{\fs12}Nice to see you. - We appreciate your time.

945
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,770
"我们都去了野外"
{\fs12}And we all went out to the field

946
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,129
"并致力于单向之路"
{\fs12}and worked on a single plot.

947
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:56,492
我明白你的意思
{\fs12}I see your point,

948
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,369
但我想让你关注此处
{\fs12}but I'd like you to focus here.

949
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,621
但我善于爬山
{\fs12}No, but I'm fine with March.

950
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:03,624
2月份 如何卖纺织品的?
{\fs12}In February, how did you sell textiles before they were sold?

951
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,085
我喜欢你说的话 如果你...
{\fs12}I like what you're saying, and if you...

952
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,671
不过是爬山 我善于爬山
{\fs12}No. But this is March. I'm fine with March.

953
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:11,799
玛利亚院长 我要和你谈谈费尔南达修女
{\fs12}Mother Marea, I need to talk to you about Sister Fernanda.

954
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:13,902
她没事吧? -  她的行为非常可疑
{\fs12}Is she all right? - Well, she's acting very suspicious.

955
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,445
我有些你想知道的事情
{\fs12}And I've learned some things I think you'd want to know.

956
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,280
她不是说那头驴逃走了吗?
{\fs12}You know how she's been saying that the donkey escaped?

957
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:20,099
不是逃跑 - 好吧 现在不是时候
{\fs12}It's not escaping. - Okay, this is not the right time.

958
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:21,991
她一直在撒谎
{\fs12}She's been lying about it the whole time.

959
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,020
你会想知道的
{\fs12}She's lying about it. You'll want to know about it.

960
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,440
我很抱歉 - 你看到这些数字了吗?
{\fs12}I'm so sorry about that. - Have you seen these numbers? Who...

961
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,943
我一般负责监督
{\fs12}I supervise in general...

962
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,653
数字 但... 
{\fs12}The numbers, but...

963
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:34,545
费尔南达有事情
{\fs12}There's something going on with Fernanda.

964
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,591
她说她要去... 
{\fs12}She said that she was going...

965
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:41,620
修女 我在问 请小声一点 - 她根本不在那里
{\fs12}Sister, I'm asking, please keep your voice down. - She wasn't there!

966
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,555
她显然在撒谎 她有个朋友过来 
{\fs12}- She was clearly lying. She had a friend over,

967
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:42,955
喝了酒
{\fs12}and she drank alcohol.

968
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:46,094
她还不睡觉 我整晚都在听她说话 - 没说那么多...
{\fs12}She's staying up! I hear her up all night. - Don't talk so much...

969
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,814
驴子逃走的事 她显然是在骗人
{\fs12}She's clearly lying about the donkey escaping.

970
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:52,190
她为什么要拿驴子撒谎?
{\fs12}Why would she lie about the donkey?

971
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,025
我不知道她为什么撒谎 但我检查了围墙 
{\fs12}I don't know why she's lying, but I checked the walls,

972
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,289
检查了所有的大门
{\fs12}and I checked all of the gates.

973
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:56,695
那头驴是不可能逃走的 
{\fs12}There's no way that donkey's escaping.

974
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,947
我认为需要别人照顾驴子
{\fs12}I think that donkey needs someone else to take care of her.

975
00:59:58,971 --> 00:59:59,971
我可以照顾她
{\fs12}I can take care of her.

976
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,683
我会考虑的
{\fs12}I will consider it.

977
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:04,855
谢谢 院长 - 我们稍后再讨论这个问题
{\fs12}Thank you, Mother. - We'll discuss this later.

978
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,897
这不是很棒吗 修女们?
{\fs12}Isn't that amazing, Sisters?

979
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,566
那朵玫瑰有能力
{\fs12}That Rose had the ability

980
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:15,613
预测弗雷德里克二世死亡的确切日期
{\fs12}to predict the exact day of the death of Frederick II.

981
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:20,284
我认为我们都有能力与神紧密联系
{\fs12}I think we all have this ability to connect deeply with God.

982
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:23,037
我分享这个故事 因为我们不总是听从上帝
{\fs12}I share the story, because we don't always listen to God.

983
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,170
嘿
{\fs12}Hey!

984
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,131
这是怎么回事?
{\fs12}What's going on?

985
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:17,716
你会说话?
{\fs12}You can speak?

986
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,428
不
{\fs12}No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

987
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,555
我听到了 
{\fs12}I heard you. I heard you!

988
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,182
告诉我现在怎么回事
{\fs12}Tell me what's going on right now,

989
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:28,018
否则我会告诉大家 你一直在耍我们
{\fs12}or I'm gonna tell everyone here that you've been tricking us!

990
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,639
好了 对不起
{\fs12}All right, all right, all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

991
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,248
我不应该和你说话
{\fs12}I'm not supposed to talk to you.

992
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,592
你不应该和我说话?
{\fs12}You're not supposed to talk to me?

993
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,192
那是什么意思?
{\fs12}What does that even mean?

994
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,695
有人吗
{\fs12}Hello? Hello?

995
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,756
趴下 - 你能听到我吗?
{\fs12}Get down. Get down. - Can you hear me?

996
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,699
你能听到我说话吗?你好?
{\fs12}Can you hear me? Hello?

997
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,867
不 你听不到
{\fs12}No, you can't hear me.

998
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,160
你能听到我的想法吗?
{\fs12}Can you hear my thoughts?

999
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,079
因为我能听到你的想法
{\fs12}'Cause I can hear your thoughts.

1000
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:48,539
我能听到你的想法
{\fs12}I can hear your thoughts.

1001
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,332
你好
{\fs12}Hi.

1002
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,490
这感觉好不同
{\fs12}This feels different.

1003
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,492
我想我更喜欢和女孩上床
{\fs12}I think I like sex with girls.

1004
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:26,910
我从没告诉过任何人
{\fs12}I never told anyone.

1005
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,788
我有很多秘密 我是犹太人
{\fs12}I have lots of secrets. I'm Jewish.

1006
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,640
没人知道 但现在你知道了
{\fs12}Nobody knows, but now you know.

1007
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,667
但你不知道 因为你无法...
{\fs12}But you don't know, 'cause you can't...

1008
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:34,959
天使来了
{\fs12}There's the angels.

1009
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,504
你看到天使了吗?
{\fs12}Do you see the angels?

1010
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,632
我看到了 我听到了
{\fs12}I see the... Oh, I hear 'em. I hear 'em.

1011
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,218
她们知道我在这里
{\fs12}Oh, they know. They know I'm here. They know I'm here.

1012
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,720
天啊 好
{\fs12}Oh, God. Okay.

1013
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:49,975
你在这里干什么?
{\fs12}What are you doing here?

1014
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,102
我是来核查干草的 嘘
{\fs12}I'm just looking through the hay. Shh!

1015
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,835
费尔南达 你他妈的到底怎么了?
{\fs12}Fernanda! - What the fuck is wrong with you?

1016
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,444
为什么你脸上都是血?
{\fs12}Why is there blood all over your face?

1017
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,736
别挡我的路
{\fs12}Get out of my way!

1018
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,365
费尔南达?费尔南达?
{\fs12}Fernanda? Fernanda?

1019
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:52,204
那边 快 他们把驴带走了
{\fs12}Over there. Come on. They have the donkey.

1020
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:57,875
天啊 你没事吧?
{\fs12}Oh, jeez. Are you okay?

1021

1025
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:06,677
好的
{\fs12}Okay, okay.

1026
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:09,012
我们继续走
{\fs12}Let's keep moving. We're gonna keep going.

1027
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,056

1032
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,087
我服了颠茄素 - 什么?
{\fs12}I took the belladonna. I took the belladonna. - What?

1033
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,173
她做了爱 所以我也要做爱
{\fs12}She had it. She had the sex, and so I was gonna have the sex.

1034
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,968
所以我提取了颠茄 所以我可以做爱
{\fs12}So I did belladonna so I could have the sex...

1035
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:11,992
女巫
{\fs12}Witches.

1036
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:13,869
她们是女巫
{\fs12}They're witches!

1037
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,705
他闹得很大声
{\fs12}He's making a lot of noise.

1038
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,117
没关系 他是个聋哑

暂且不提

01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,484
为罪恶
{\fs12}For sins.

1164
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,113
请宽恕我
{\fs12}Please have mercy on me.

1165
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:06,632
为了惩罚你
{\fs12}For your punishment,

1166
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,216
我要你斋戒一年 
{\fs12}I'm going to have you fast for one year.

1167
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,035
OK
{\fs12}Okay.

1168
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,787
我还没有解释 所以这不OK - OK
{\fs12}I didn't explain it yet, so it's not okay. - Okay.

1169
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,415
人不吃 会死的
{\fs12}Because a human being can't live on not eating.

1170
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,810
不 - 我不是说你整整一年都不吃东西
{\fs12}No. - I don't mean you're not gonna eat for a whole year.

1171
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,295
你只有白天一顿饭
{\fs12}You just pick a meal in the day

1172
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:22,756
然后跳过一顿 - 好的
{\fs12}and skip it. - Okay.

1173
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:25,592
说的是午餐 每天你都得跳过午餐
{\fs12}So, say, it's lunch. Every day, you've got to skip lunch.

1174
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:27,344
是 - 那算什么餐?
{\fs12}Yes. - And what meal is that?

1175
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,637
呃
{\fs12}Uh...

1176
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,474
根据你的建议 我不吃午饭了
{\fs12}Based on your suggestion, I'll skip lunch.

1177
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,853
这不是我的建议
{\fs12}It's not my suggestion.

1178
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,145
你必须感受到罪恶
{\fs12}You have to feel the sin.

1179
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:39,356
我能感觉到午餐
{\fs12}I can feel lunch.

1180
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,191
亚历山大修女
{\fs12}Sister Alessandra.

1181
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:43,693
你知道的
{\fs12}You know...

1182
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:45,487
我是你父亲的朋友
{\fs12}I'm friends with your father,

1183
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:47,405
他的女儿竟然这样?
{\fs12}and now his daughter is doing this?

1184
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,824
对不起 我很抱歉
{\fs12}I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1185
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,577
真丢人
{\fs12}It's embarrassing.

1186
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:56,039
我很尴尬 你觉得他会有什么感觉?
{\fs12}For me, I'm embarrassed. How do you think he's gonna feel when he knows this?

1187
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:57,499
别告诉我父亲
{\fs12}Please don't tell my father.

1188
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,102
没必要告诉我父亲 - 他是教会的赞助人
{\fs12}There's no need to tell my father. - He's a patron of the church,

1189
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,126
最大的一个
{\fs12}one of the biggest.

1190
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:05,590
这个地方完全失修 正在崩溃
{\fs12}And this place is completely in disrepair. It's falling apart.

1191
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,884
看起来像富利卡亚的谷仓
{\fs12}It looks like a barn in Filicaia.

1192
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,346
你去过那里吗?
{\fs12}Have you been there?

1193
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:13,078
真恶心 - 太恶心了
{\fs12}It's disgusting. - It's disgusting!

1194
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,933
请不要这么说
{\fs12}Please, please don't say that.

1195
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,185
我想把这个地方叫做小富利卡亚
{\fs12}I think I want to call this place Little Filicaia.

1196
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:18,496
不 求你了 - 我会的
{\fs12}No, please. - I might.

1197
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,688
费尔南达修女 这是你的罪过
{\fs12}Sister Fernanda, these are your sins.

异端
{\fs12}heresy,

1200
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,061
粗言秽语 - 这只是我的声调
{\fs12}abusive language... - It's just the tone of my voice.

1201
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:28,488
同性恋
{\fs12}Homosexuality...

狂欢 巫术
{\fs12}Revelings, witchcraft.

1203
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:34,827
你瞥眼睛了吗?
{\fs12}Did you roll your eyes?

1204
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:35,911
没有
{\fs12}No.

1205
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:38,998
你在瞥眼睛
{\fs12}You were rolling your eyes.

1206
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:43,086
玛利亚修女 我不知道该说什么
{\fs12}Sister Marea, I don't know what to say.

1207
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,046
我很震惊
{\fs12}I am shocked.

1208
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,590
淫乱?寻欢作乐?
{\fs12}Fornication? Living in pleasure?

1209
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,343
你 玛利亚修女 你
{\fs12}You, Sister Marea, you.

1210
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,303
爱俗世?
{\fs12}Loving the world?

1211
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,847
你为什么呆在这里?
{\fs12}Why don't you just stay here?

1212
01:13:54,139 --> 01:13:56,391
你为什么不留在你爱的俗世里?
{\fs12}Why don't you stay in this world that you love so much?

1213
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:57,851
因为好玩吗?
{\fs12}Isn't it fun?

1214
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,187
你有什么要说的吗?
{\fs12}Do you have anything to say?

1215
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:03,231
我很抱歉 教宗阁下
{\fs12}I'm so sorry, Your Holiness.

1216
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,358
你在乎吗?
{\fs12}Do you care?

1217
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:09,487
只因完全缺乏...
{\fs12}It's just complete lack of...

1218
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,139
你们在互相微笑吗?
{\fs12}Are you guys smiling at each other?

1219
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:14,325
你们能有片刻不看彼此?
{\fs12}Can you have a moment to not look at each other?

1220
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:15,702
你们都失控了
{\fs12}You're both out of control.

1221
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:19,789
妥玛索神父
{\fs12}Father Tommasso...

1222
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,361
我都不知道从何说起
{\fs12}I don't even know where to begin.

1223
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:24,502
我请求你的宽恕
{\fs12}I ask your forgiveness...

1224
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:28,715
我祈求上帝的宽恕
{\fs12}And I ask God's forgiveness

1225
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:31,468
因为这群牧羊人的失败
{\fs12}for failing as the shepherd of this flock.

1226
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:35,722
我请求你不要因为我的过失 而惩罚修道院修女
{\fs12}I only ask that you please not punish the sisters of this convent for my failings.

1227
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,020
玛利亚
{\fs12}Marea.

1228
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,940
我很抱歉
{\fs12}I'm so sorry.

1229
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,528
他夺走了我的神职
{\fs12}He's taken away my priesthood.

1230
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,742
我要去圣迪比亚吉奥当和尚
{\fs12}I have to go to San Biagio and become a monk.

1231
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,660
我很抱歉把你拖下水
{\fs12}I'm so sorry for dragging you into this.

1232
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,832
你是个好女人 玛利亚
{\fs12}You're a good woman. You're a good woman, Marea.

1233
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,967
我应该... - 你到底在干什么?
{\fs12}I should... - What the hell are you doing?

1234
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,919
快离开这里
{\fs12}Get outta here!

1235
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,670
你刚才在里面不是才忏悔过吗?
{\fs12}You were just crying in there?

1236
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:11,382
你怎么了?
{\fs12}What's wrong with you?

1237
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,510
和弗朗西丝卡躺在一起值得吗?
{\fs12}Was lying with Francesca worth it?

1238
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,241
我真的不想谈这个
{\fs12}I really don't want to talk about it.

1239
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,597
那胸呢? - 非常丰盈
{\fs12}What about that bosom? Very ample.

1240
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:20,350
超级丰盈 而且是布鲁诺的妻子
{\fs12}Super ample, plus it's Bruno's wife,

1241
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:22,310
所以必须是如此风骚
{\fs12}so it had to be so intense.

1242
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:23,937
你们能不能别再说了?
{\fs12}Can you guys please stop talking?

1243
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:25,709
你听说她的事了 对吧?
{\fs12}You heard what happened to her, right?

1244
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:27,297
没有 我怎么会听到?
{\fs12}No. How could I have heard?

"在寒冷的季末

{\fs12}"surges the sap that revives the broom and heather.

1248

{\fs12}"When the peach trees blossom and the frog sings in the pool

{\fs12}"and the willow and elder grow,

而当干燥的月份到来
{\fs12}"as I see the dry months come,

1251

我在大果园

你打扫完地窖了吗?
{\fs12}Did you finish cleaning the cellar?

1260
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,175
是 都完成了
{\fs12}Yeah, all done.

1261
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:40,305
是不是很烦人?
{\fs12}Isn't it so annoying?

1262
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:41,931
真烦人 - 我告诉过你了
{\fs12}So annoying. - I told you.

1263
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:44,850
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

1264
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:53,775
抱歉 我告密了你
{\fs12}Sorry I told on you.

1265
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:58,948
对不起 我告诉了玛利亚院长
{\fs12}Sorry that I told Mother Marea every time I thought

1266
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,409
每次我觉得有些事情不对劲的时候
{\fs12}something wasn't right or weird.

1267
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:05,246
抱歉我毁了你的仪式
{\fs12}Sorry I ruined your ritual.

1268
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,834
很抱歉 我没告诉你我是个女巫
{\fs12}I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was a witch.

1269
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:14,172
但说实话
{\fs12}But honestly,

1270
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:17,258
我想最终 我能把你们都变成女巫
{\fs12}I thought eventually I could turn you all into witches,

1271
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,595
你会加入我的集会 但我知道这听起来很愚蠢
{\fs12}and you'd join my coven, but I know that sounds stupid.

1272
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,388
你真的认为我会做女巫?
{\fs12}You really think I could be a witch?

1273
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:26,434
是

你觉得她们会杀了他吗?
{\fs12}Do you think they're gonna kill him?

1275
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,577
我不知道最近乔瓦尼怎么样了
{\fs12}I don't know what's going on with Giovanni lately.

1276
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,598
你注意到她们为士兵们提供的胡萝卜都软趴趴的吗?
{\fs12}Have you noticed the carrots they're serving the soldiers are mushier?

1277
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:49,502
我昨天也说了同样的话
{\fs12}I was saying the same thing yesterday.

1278
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:52,024
我无所谓 如果胡萝卜外面都黏糊糊的
{\fs10}(赤裸裸的暗喻)
{\fs12}I would even be okay if they were mushy on the outside

1279
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,396
里面很脆 我并不需要从里到外的脆
{\fs12}and crispy on the inside. I don't need, like, a full crisp, but...

1280
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,273
可能有点伤感 胡萝卜有点软对我不是问题
{\fs12}It could be a little mushy. I'm fine with a little mush.

1281
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,566
因为这是胡萝卜布丁
{\fs12}'Cause this is basically carrot pudding.

1282
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,633
他在哪?

看起来她可能会很忠诚
{\fs12}who seems like she might be up to fidelity.

1288
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,286
想象一下
{\fs12}Imagine that.

1289
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:31,165
一旦她进入青春期
{\fs12}Once she hits puberty.

1290
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:35,128
谢谢你帮我一个大忙
{\fs12}I have to thank you for doing me an incredible favor.

1291
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,965
我的妻子隐瞒了她的祖先
{\fs12}My wife, who had hidden her Guelph ancestry,

1292
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:40,925
结果是
{\fs12}turned out to be

1293
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,094
相当的贫瘠的阴道
{\fs12}quite the barren twat.

1294
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:44,762
你给了我所有的理由
{\fs12}And you've given me every reason

1295
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,223
用野猪和狗把她封印在墙上
{\fs12}to seal her up in a wall with a boar and a dog.

1296
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,436
我有个好消息
{\fs12}I've got some good news

1297
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:52,937
还有一些坏消息
{\fs12}and some bad news.

1298
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,564
你喜欢哪一个? 
{\fs12}Which would you like first?

1299
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:56,315
我不在乎
{\fs12}I don't care.

1300
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,792
好消息是我会让你活很久
{\fs12}The good news is I'm going to keep you alive for as long as I can.

1301
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,865
听起来很愉快 坏消息是
{\fs12}It sounds cheery. The bad news is

1302
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:06,492
这只是为了让我给你更多的痛苦...
{\fs12}it's only so that I can inflict as much pain

1303
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:09,996
和堕落 因为我要折磨你的肉体
{\fs12}and degradation as I torture your flesh.

1304
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:12,582
我很难确定
{\fs12}I'm having a hard time determining

1305
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:14,417
我最喜欢哪个酷刑
{\fs12}which of my favorite torture methods

1306
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,210
对你先来一套
{\fs12}to start with upon you.

1307
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:19,464
有拇指夹 我有一个凯瑟琳车轮
{\fs12}Got the thumbscrew. I have a Catherine wheel.

1308
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:21,340
我后面有个架子
{\fs12}I have a rack out back.

1309
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,301
这里占用了太多的空间
{\fs12}It was taking up too much space in here,

1310
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,595
但仍然功能齐全
{\fs12}but still fully functional.

1311
01:19:25,887 --> 01:19:27,513
有个新的刑具 叫做鼠盒
{\fs12}There's a new one called the rat box

1312
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:29,766
来自西西里
{\fs12}just in from Sicily.

1313
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,684
鼠盒 不被混淆于
{\fs12}The rat box, not to be confused with

1314
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,644
我所说的我老婆的女人私密区
{\fs12}what I call my wife's private area

1315
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:34,976
也就是你参观过地方
{\fs12}after you'd been to visit.

1316
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,274
这是一只开孔的鼠盒
{\fs12}It's a box of rats with one open side

1317
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:39,984
放在你的腹部
{\fs12}placed against your abdomen.

1318
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,070
我在盒子的另一边点火
{\fs12}I light a fire on the other side of the box,

1319
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:45,239
让老鼠们在试图逃跑的时候
{\fs12}so that the rats, in their attempts to escape,

1320
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,159
会钻过你的肠子
{\fs12}burrow through your guts.

1321
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,703
无论如何 会有很多的乐趣
{\fs12}Anyway, we'll have a lot of fun together

1322
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,706
在未来的日子里 也许是几周
{\fs12}in the coming days and maybe weeks,

1323
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,500
取决于你有多强硬
{\fs12}depending on how tough you are.

1324
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,670
你哪儿也去不了
{\fs12}Don't go anywhere.

1325
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:05,467
妈的
{\fs12}Shit.

1326
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,935
根本没有好消息
{\fs12}There was no good news in that at all.

1327
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:18,064
嘿  我真的
{\fs12}Hey, um... I'd actually...

1328
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:20,000
如果你们现在让我出去 我会很感激的
{\fs12}I'd really appreciate it if you guys let me out now.

1330
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,234
不能这样对我们
{\fs12}Can't do that to us.

1331
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,986
拜托 - 设身处地
{\fs12}Please. - It's a tough position.

1332
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,738
我们是朋友 好吗?
{\fs12}Hey, hey, we're friends, all right?

1333
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,310
你也不想在这里
{\fs12}You don't want to be here either.

1334
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:29,033
让我出去 我们会逃跑的
{\fs12}Just let me out. We'll make a run for it.

1335
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,369
我 - 我们不能
{\fs12}I... - We can't.

1336
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:33,037
他什么都逃不开
{\fs12}He can't make a run for anything.

1337
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,540
如果我死了 那是你的良心
{\fs12}If I die, that's on your conscience.

1338
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,112
你不想内疚地活着
{\fs12}You don't want to live with that.

1339
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,375
求你
{\fs12}Please.

1340
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:39,669
什么
{\fs12}What... Is...

1341
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,547
好 你要快点行动
{\fs12}Okay. You're gonna have to move quick,

1342
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,173
特别是在护城河附近
{\fs12}especially around the moat.

1343
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,151
外面的守卫真的很嗜血
{\fs12}The guards out there have a real thirst for blood.

1344
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,553
当然 非常感谢
{\fs12}Yes, of course. Thank you so much.

1345
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:49,887
好了 我放开了 - 好的
{\fs12}Okay, here I go. - Okay.

1346
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,014
我要解开你的锁
{\fs12}I'm unlocking you.

1347
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:55,726
你搞什么...
{\fs12}What are you...

1348
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,830
有一只蜡烛乌龟
{\fs12}There's a turtle with a candle on it!

1349
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:59,021
真的?
{\fs12}Really?

1350
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:00,749
等等 别离开我
{\fs12}Wait, wait, wait! Don't leave me!

1351
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,334
嘿 你要去哪里?别离开我
{\fs12}Hey, where are you going? Don't leave me!

1352
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:06,362
快 站住 你这狗屎
{\fs12}Come on! Just please. Stop, you shits!

1353
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:08,294
我们看看乌龟要做什么 - 妈的
{\fs12}Let's see what he does. - Shit.

1354
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:26,424
你在这里干什么?
{\fs12}What are you doing here?

1355
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:28,384
我们要把你弄出去 - 你好
{\fs12}We're getting you out. Hi.

1356
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:34,598
快
{\fs12}Come on!

1357
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,728
快 快
{\fs12}Come on. Come on.

1358
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,938
快
{\fs12}Whoa, whoa. Come on!

1359
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,857
没事的 我会给你的
{\fs12}No, no, it's okay. I'm giving it to you.

1360
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:44,901
你可以相信我们
{\fs12}You can trust us.

1361
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:46,736
我们在拯救你
{\fs12}We're rescuing you!

1362
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:49,363
我绣了这个娃娃放在你的房间
{\fs12}I embroidered this doll to put in your place.

1363
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,775
我们给你带来了暗夜袍子 让你隐于黑夜
{\fs12}We brought you a lunar habit to hide you in the night.

1364
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,508
我们想把你带回修道院
{\fs12}We want to bring you back to the convent.

1365
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,664
好吧
{\fs12}All right.

1366
01:21:58,956 --> 01:21:59,956
好了 我们走
{\fs12}All right, let's go.

1367
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:01,124
我还需要那个
{\fs12}I'm gonna need that back.

1368
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,450
穿上袍子 钥匙
{\fs12}Put on the habit. Key. Oh, key!

1369
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:11,135
好吧
{\fs12}Okay. All right.

1370
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,305
我们走
{\fs12}Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1371
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,881
你觉得这和我们剪头发有关吗?
{\fs12}You think this has something to do with our hair being cut?

1372
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,526
你觉得我们应该告诉布鲁诺吗?
{\fs12}You think we should tell Bruno about that?

1373
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:31,739
他手里满是他妻子墙上的东西
{\fs12}He's got his hands full with the wife in the wall and everything.

1374
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:35,201
我们刚刚看到了最疯狂的事情 你不会相信的
{\fs12}We just saw the wildest thing. You would not believe it.

1375
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,204
那是一只海龟
{\fs12}Well, it was a turtle...

1376
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:45,752
快
{\fs12}Come on.

1377
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,247
你好
{\fs12}Hello.

1378
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,207
妥玛索
{\fs12}Tommasso.

1379
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,325
修道院的情况如何?
{\fs12}How are things at the convent?

1380
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:29,088
很孤独
{\fs12}It's lonely.

1381
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:34,427
那座修道院太无聊了
{\fs12}That monastery is so boring.

1382
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:38,889
我们所做的就是祈祷
{\fs12}All we do is pray.

1383
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,767
我的意思是 这很重要 但是
{\fs12}I mean, it's important, but...

1384
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,146
都是因为男人
{\fs12}It's all men.

1385
01:23:46,397 --> 01:23:48,065
看到你的脸真好
{\fs12}It's so good to see your face.

1386
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:59,358
有人来了
{\fs12}Someone's coming.

1387
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,752
快
{\fs12}Come on!

1388
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,630
快
{\fs12}Come on.

1389
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:23,934
她们都走了
{\fs12}They're gone.

1390
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:38,274
好了 走吧
{\fs12}All right, come on.

1391
