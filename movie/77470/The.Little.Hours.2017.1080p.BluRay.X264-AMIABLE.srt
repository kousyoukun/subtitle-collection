2
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,421
Where were you during lauds?
Why did you miss lauds?

3
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,989
She got out last night,
and I had to find her.

4
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,257
Took me all morning.

5
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,392
- She got out again?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,428
Do you think she's getting
through the gate?

7
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,395
You think she could
get through the gate?

8
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,730
I should check the gates.

9
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,365
Or maybe she got through
the wall.

10
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,900
How would she get
through the wall, though?

11
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,062
I don't know. Why do you care
about the donkey so much?

12
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,870
Just doesn't make any sense.

13
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,573
Why are you wearing
your black habit? It's spring.

14
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,941
Because it was dark when I left,

15
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,710
and it was the closest thing
to me, so I grabbed it.

16
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:04,710
I'm gonna change.

17
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,878
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

18
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,250
Beautiful morning, sisters.

19
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:11,250
- Hey, don't fucking talk to us!
- Fucking creep.

20
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:15,287
- I told you to never talk to us, you piece of shit!
- How dare you, fuckers!

21
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,355
Get the fuck out of here!

22
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,833
<font color="#ff8040"><i>Blessed art thou, o lord.
Teach me to know thy will.</i></font>

23
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:32,537
By these lips, let the awards
thou makest ever be recorded.

24
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,440
Blithely, as one that has
found great possessions,

25
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,743
I follow thy decrees.

26
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,679
Bethinking me still
of the charge thou givest,

27
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,914
I will mark thy footsteps.

28
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,883
Be thy covenant ever my delight,

29
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,320
thy words kept in memory.

30
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,891
Christ the lord was tempted
and suffered for us.

31
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,327
Come, let us adore him.

32
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,995
So, why weren't you at lauds
this morning?

33
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,798
Because the donkey escaped in the
woods, and I had to catch her.

34
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,433
The donkey escaped again?

35
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,502
Yeah. I think she got through
the gate.

36
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,504
She got through the gate.

37
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,705
All right. Well...

38
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,608
But I'll make sure it
doesn't happen again.

39
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,576
Okay, good.
I'll tell father Tommasso.

40
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,346
<font color="#ff8040"><i>What's going on
with sister Alessandra?</i></font>

41
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,514
She's been so out of it.

42
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,616
I don't know. Her dad's
probably visiting or something.

43
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,918
Again?

44
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,720
Yeah.
She's fucking delusional.

45
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,621
Yeah. She's so delusional.

46
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,725
She's pathetic.

47
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,993
Just because your dad
gives money to the convent,

48
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,739
doesn't mean you're gonna
get everything you want.

49
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,063
Yeah.

50
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:05,063
I walked in on her
the other day,

51
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,966
and she was literally
just staring out the window

52
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,468
for, like, 10 minutes,
not moving.

53
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,069
Really?

54
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,072
She's probably, like,
daydreaming about some guy

55
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,408
that's gonna magically come
and take her away from here.

56
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,143
- It's like, "good luck."

57
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,412
I know.

58
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,392
So, what was mother Marea
saying to you earlier?

59
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,894
Nothing. Mind your own
fucking business.

60
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,811
Okay.

61
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,079
But I'll do that, yeah.

62
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,647
I can sweep it
if you want me to.

63
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,416
For some reason,
it keeps getting unorganized,

64
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,750
and I'm not really sure
who's doing that.

65
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,619
Okay, yes, maybe
you could sweep the cellar,

66
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,621
because that's very dusty,
you know.

67
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,089
That's the cellar and the altar.

68
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:04,089
I can organize all the incense,

69
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,559
because, for some reason, it
keeps getting all messed up,

70
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,127
and I'm not really sure
who's doing that.

71
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,996
But also, mother, there's
something else you should know.

72
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,531
Yes?

73
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:12,531
Last night at dinner...

74
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:16,935
- Mmm-hmm.
- I saw sister Latizia take two portions.

75
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,437
I don't know.
Maybe you're not counting,

76
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,838
so maybe it doesn't matter.

77
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,174
Just in case you are,
it was sister Latizia.

78
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,610
I don't think you should
be concerning yourself

79
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,846
with the amount
somebody is eating.

80
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,082
We all require
different amounts of food.

81
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,820
I know that some days I need
more food, some days less...

82
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,488
So, watching me eat
so carefully,

83
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,690
that would make
me uncomfortable.

84
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,793
So I don't think you should be
bothering yourself with that.

85
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,795
Yes, mother.

86
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,464
Hi, dad.

87
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,698
Hi, sweetheart.

88
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,233
How are you, my angel?

89
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,801
I'm good. How are you?

90
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,003
I'm well. You look beautiful.

91
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,505
Thank you.

92
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,574
What I can make out.

93
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,843
You look terrific.
Are they feeding you?

94
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,078
Eh...

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,814
They should be feeding you, for
all the money we send them here.

96
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,082
But you look beautiful.

97
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,817
Thank you. Thank you.
How's mom?

98
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,653
Mom is good. Mom is...
Everybody's well.

99
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,022
Good. The merchant Ricardo,
how's he?

100
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,626
Merchant Ricardo, uh, yes. Glad
you brought it up. He's good.

101
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,727
Has he asked about me?

102
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,928
Sure. You bet he has.

103
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,129
Hmm.

104
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:18,129
You know, last time
you and I spoke,

105
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:23,034
I was hoping that we'd have the
whole dowry situation locked up,

106
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,804
and, um,
we're not there just yet.

107
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,572
They're asking
for a lot of money,

108
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,876
and, you know, with the money
we're sending here,

109
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,745
and then to your sisters
and their children, it's a...

110
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:37,849
There's a lot of money going out
and not that much coming in, so...

111
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,686
But maybe if we sent less
money here to the convent,

112
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,154
we could save it up,

113
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,590
and I could even come and live
with you and mom and...

114
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,559
I don't think sending less
money here is a good idea,

115
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,962
because, uh, that would
reflect badly on the family.

116
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:54,566
But I know how eager you are
to be married, my baby.

117
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:58,637
I know, but maybe it's...
Maybe that's not your calling.

118
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,642
How's your embroidery going?
You still doing that?

119
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:04,776
Mmm-hmm.

120
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:04,776
Good, 'cause you're so good,

121
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,313
and maybe that's your calling,
you know.

122
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,716
Some people, it's marriage and
family and the warmth of a home,

123
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,219
and maybe for you it's...
It's the detailed embroidery.

124
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,722
You know, keep... please.

125
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,324
Keep your chin up.

126
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,892
Give me...
Give me a little sugar.

127
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,929
Hey, hey, sweetie.

128
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,997
All right. Daddy loves you.

129
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,599
I love you.

130
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,802
Okay. All right,
you take care, and...

131
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,737
You don't... don't...
Don't you lose hope.

132
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,586
<font color="#ff8040"><i>The body of Christ.</i></font>

133
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,887
Amen.

134
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,024
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

135
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,195
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

136
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,335
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

137
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,240
Are you all right?

138
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,345
The body of Christ.

139
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,956
So, sister Alessandra,
how was your father's visit?

140
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,859
Good.

141
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:29,894
Good?

142
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,297
Yes, it was good.

143
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,370
Any potential suitors?

144
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,173
That's not even what his visit
was about.

145
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,341
We didn't even talk about that.

146
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,676
Then what was his visit about?

147
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:44,676
Oh, my god!

148
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,813
Hey, I told you not to fucking
look at us, you creep.

149
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,981
I'm sorry. I am...

150
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,750
Why are you making eye contact
with us?

151
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,752
Look at the ground,
you fucking pervert!

152
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,886
- I'm sorry.
- What is this shit?

153
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,987
This is a turnip.

154
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,088
That's not a turnip!
It's shit!

155
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,088
Ouch.

156
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,825
You expect us to eat shit?
You're a piece of shit!

157
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,761
- Yeah, you are a piece of shit. You're disgusting!
- I'm sorry.

158
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,863
Yeah, you are
a disgusting piece of shit!

159
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,398
Think we can just eat
any of this food?

160
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,967
We're fucking starving!
You can't do anything right!

161
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,769
Look at this wall!
Look at the stuff you build!

162
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,071
It's horrible,
you fucking imbecile!

163
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,673
What do you even do here?

164
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,440
- Please, please.
- Think you can talk to us?

165
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,775
You think you can look at us?

166
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,109
You know who my father is?

167
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:18,109
Yes! He deserves this!

168
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,746
He pays you good money
to do nothing, you little rat!

169
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,014
- You're a little fucking rat!

170
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,883
What is this, maggot food?

171
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:24,883
- We hate you!
- Please, please.

172
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,753
Just hoarding all the food,
huh, like a fucking Jew?

173
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,888
Is that what you're doing?

174
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,756
- We're all starving!

175
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,957
You know what you did!

176
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,325
We hate you!

177
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,393
You deserve to die!

178
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,233
All right. Almost ready?

179
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,368
Tommasso, yes.

180
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,371
- Almost ready.
- Oh, look at this!

181
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,706
Isn't it beautiful?

182
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,007
That's gorgeous. Who did that?

183
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,308
Sister Alessandra.

184
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,309
We have to make more of that.

185
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,311
That'll go big in town.

186
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,346
Tell Lurco to keep
that garden gate closed,

187
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,048
because the deer
are getting into it.

188
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,050
All right.

189
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:03,923
All right, my friend.

190
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:07,826
Are you ready for a journey?
Are you ready?

191
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,394
<font color="#ff8040"><i>"Know when the leaf

00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,124
- They're not good people.
- No, Lurco...

204
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,093
No, I'm leaving.
The nuns, no. They spit on me.

205
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,394
- Who spit on you?
- They spit on me.

206
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,463
Lurco, I have to leave.

207
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,833
I'm about to leave to go to the
market to sell the fabrics, please!

208
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,769
Father, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry.
They spit on me.

209
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,237
They called me a Jew.

210
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,105
- They called me a Jew, father Tommasso.
- Lurco, please.

211
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,387
- They called me a Jew.
- Please.

212
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,810
Please, just wait two days!

213

<font color="#ff8040"><i>I want to think

215
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,923
<font color="#ff8040"><i>that is pleasant and luxurious.</i></font>

216
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,359
Enjoy this pheasant.

217
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,863
Soon as Florence gets here,

218
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,233
we'll be eating chicken like
a bunch of fucking Croatians.

219
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,570
I sent another messenger
to Florence.

220
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,105
Messenger came back.

221
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,240
He's dealing
with the Guelph soldiers.

222
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,843
He's got Florence.
He's got Arezzo.

223
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,345
He doesn't have Pisa yet,
but he will,

224
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,815
and then he's coming for us.

225
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,850
So, I sent a messenger
to Arezzo.

226
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,186
He's not in Arezzo.

227
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,188
He's in Pisa.

228
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,957
He's going...
He's making a play for Pisa!

229
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,861
He doesn't have Pisa yet,
but he will.

230
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,263
They're weak, like the guelphs.

231
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,934
You know what comes
after Pisa? Lucca.

232
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,869
He's coming for our silk trade.

233
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,838
So, my dear,

234
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,540
enjoy this lavish lifestyle,
your two dresses,

235
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,312
your pheasant, your lentils.
Live it up.

236
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,634
It's coming to an end.

237
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,983
This... this Florentine
conspiracy thing

238
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:11,983
is getting to the point
of, like,

239
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,586
he talks about it so much,
it's like a mental illness.

240
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,987
- I'll be fake sleeping...
- Mmm-hmm.

241
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,522
And he's still going on
about it.

242
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,157
- "We're gonna lose everything."
- Mmm-hmm.

243
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,157
And that's what... I'm like...
At this point, I'm like,

244
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,594
"you know what? I hope we do,
just so you'll shut up."

245
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,462
- Just shut up.
- Mmm-hmm.

246
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,900
He thinks that everything that
happens is because of them.

247
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:28,900
Yeah, he says a lot of things.

248
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:33,872
He's just... Just, it's not...
Even his tone is awful.

249
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,406
Yeah? You act like I don't
suffer through it, too.

250
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,408
I'm right there with you.

251
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,645
That sounded like him.

252
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,113
- Hmm?
- That sounded like him.

253
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,948
No, no, that's not him.

254
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,650
He's always asleep.
Just relax.

255
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,553
You're so cute.

256
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,588
- I felt like... I felt I heard the...
- No, no.

257
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,391
All right, we're gonna fuck again.
That'll help you relax.

258
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,026
No! That is him.

259
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,564
No! That's... that is him.

260
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,099
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

261
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,437
What have you done?

262
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,172
Oh, what have I done?

263
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,175
Oh, what's out there?
Is it the guelphs?

264
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,611
Is it Florence?
Are they coming? Go get 'em!

265
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,346
I shall deal with you shortly.

266
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,982
I'm petrified.

267
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,055
Now I'll know who you are
in the morning.

268
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,324
We'll settle this in private.

269
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,297
I'll tell you
what happened, 100%.

270
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,533
A demon came in here while we
were sleeping and cut our hair.

271
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,536
There's no way to prove
it's not a demon, so...

272
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,704
Which means that it was a demon.

273
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,039
What else was it? A warlock?

274
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,513
Good morning.

275
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,381
My liege.

276
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,666
You common-born dogs.

277
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,605
One of you sluts thinks
he's quite the Jester.

278
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,177
What the fuck
are you looking at?

279
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,316
I'll fuck you where you breathe.

280
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,589
What was that all about, huh?

281
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,195
I saw Guelph men
rush into town...

282
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,631
Savage beasts,
tearing men from limb to limb.

283
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,668
I saw a little boy's head
crushed between a...

284
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,205
A man's boot and...
And a stone.

285
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,308
His eyeballs
came skittering across.

286
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,580
I saw my beautiful
eight-year-old sister, Benicia,

287
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:39,817
cleaved in half with one swipe
of a sword by the guelphs.

288
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:44,188
She was more beautifully developed
as a woman than you are today.

289
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,425
You see this copper in my hair?

290
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,761
She had the most beautiful hair
of this color all over her body.

291
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,431
Shut up.

292
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:53,431
Stop talking about this,
not at the table, okay?

293
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,667
No more eyeballs or squishing
and all that kind of stuff.

294
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,469
I don't want to hear about any
more violence at the table,

295
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,204
'cause I'm eating,
and I'm digesting, so stop it.

296
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,272
Silence!

297
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,908
How dare you?

298
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,777
You are weak.

299
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,415
I've begun to suspect you have Guelph
blood coursing through your veins.

300
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,852
Oh, no. How did you find out?

301
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,523
I will bring the devil's goad to
your bedchamber this evening,

302
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,492
and it will be freshly polished.

303
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,894
No.

304
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,395
We're not doing that anymore.

305
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,663
You're not putting anything
in there.

306
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,731
Nothing's coming out, nothing.

307
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,366
We'll see about that.

308
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm not doing that anymore.

309
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,478
- I need a refill.
- Don't.

310
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,681
- Oh.
- Please don't do this.

311
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,449
I just need a quick little refill.
Come here.

312
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:45,449
- Come here.
- You're insane.

313
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,720
- You've been so sweet to me.
- Stop, stop. Somebody's gonna catch us!

314
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,522
- Look, look, you're gonna get me fuckin' killed!
- Uh-huh.

315
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,357
If someone catches me...

316
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,493
I don't want to hurt you!
I don't want to hurt you!

317
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:55,493
- Take your pants off, then.
- No, get off!

318
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,462
It's like, why are there
so many folds in here?

319
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,202
Shit. Oh, shit.

320
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,805
Bring me his goddamn balls.

321
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,741
Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

322
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,912
God dang it! Your twigs
are all over the place.

323
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,819
Keeping up?
You keeping up?

324
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,254
Just go without me!
- Go without you?

325
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,322
I'll get there.

326
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,892
Masseto, let's talk about this!

327
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,727
Just stop! Stop!

328
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,999
Masseto, come on!

329
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,567
Masseto, come on!

330
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,668
No running!

331
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,403
Masseto!

332
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,907
Masseto!

333
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,513
Oh, no!

334
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,658
Oh, no!

335
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,760
No.

336
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,901
Father?

337
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,404
You stay away! These are mine!

338
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,471
No, it just looks like you...

339
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,673
You stay away! They're mine!

340
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:49,874
Hey, stop! Stop!

341
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,542
I'm just trying to help you!

342
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,377
If you're a bandit,
I will strike you!

343
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,879
You can either lose all
of your stuff,

344
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,914
or you can trust me
and let me help you!

345
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,617
I was entrusted to take care
of these things,

346
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,385
and I've ruined this!

347
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,688
The sisters made
all these things,

348
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,324
- and I've lost them in the water.
- It's all right.

349
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,607
- And now I've fallen...
- It's all right. I'm gonna help.

350
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,530
Are you all right?

351
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,098
I'm drunk!

352
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,600
And I have fallen with my cart,

353
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,969
and this animal went
the wrong way.

354
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,705
All right, all right, all right,
all right, just stay down.

355
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:21,707
Stay down, please.

356
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,751
There. That's it. All right.

357
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,824
I wish there was something
I could give you in repayment.

358
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,526
- I have no money. Or wine...
- No, father, I don't need any money, or wine.

359
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,129
That's... that's totally fine.
Yeah.

360
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,399
Are you sure there's nothing
I can do to repay you?

361
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,369
I don't know. If you maybe had a
place for me to stay tonight,

362
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,136
I would really appreciate it.

363
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,471
You have nowhere to stay?

364
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,538
No.

365
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,474
Oh, you're coming with me.

366
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,611
It was a total disaster.

367
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,580
I never should have stopped
to speak to Lurco.

368
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,382
That's what's held me up.

369
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,951
And then I was out at night.

370
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:10,488
I had to drink the wine,
because I had no water.

371
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,157
And then I just didn't realize
how drunk I was getting,

372
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,625
and I've lost everything!

373
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,026
I'm sorry, father.

374
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,495
I wish there was more
I could have done.

375
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,796
How am I gonna explain?

376
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,097
No, no, it's all right.

377
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,066
You've done...
You've done a lot.

378
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,508
Right, here you are.
Fresh bread for you.

379
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,445
Oh, careful. Go...
Take it easy.

380
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,180
It's really, really good.

381
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,685
Good, good. I'm...
I'm sorry I was so...

382
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,123
Excited and upset before. I...

383
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,658
That's all right. That's...

384
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,895
Would you like some wine?

385
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,030
Bottom up. Up.

386
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,433
Up! Uh-uh...

387
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,037
I didn't touch it.

388
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,677
This has been wonderful.

389
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,812
Too wonderful.

390
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:07,812
What a blessing!

391
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:12,650
- The best blessing I have ever experienced.
- You saved me!

392
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,752
You saved me! Are you kidding?

393
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,654
- I'm not kidding.

394
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,122
I didn't save you.

395
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,925
I couldn't put it... The wheel
of the donkey cart back on.

396
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,162
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

397
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:29,099
It has been years,

398
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,469
many years
since my last confession.

399
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,471
- Hmm.
- Here are my sins.

400
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,639
I have slept
with another man's wife.

401
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:39,510
He's a nobleman,
and he is my master.

402
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,811
Well, that's adultery.

403
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,047
I know.

404
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,482
It's a very serious sin.

405
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,749
Sometimes...

406
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:51,689
She would place her mouth
around my sex.

407
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,692
Well, that's sodomy.

408
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,495
It's also a serious sin.

409
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,531
Is it also considered
sodomy if...

410
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:05,769
If I placed my mouth
on her sex while...

411
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:09,507
She simultaneously had...
Had her mouth around mine?

412
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,710
Why would you do that?

413
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,046
Because she... she liked it.

414
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,114
Oh.

415
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,787
Well, yes, that's also sodomy.

416
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,924
I thought sodomy was...
Was just when I would...

417
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:31,028
When someone would penetrate
the rear... the rear end.

418
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,533
Yes, that's...
That's also sodomy.

419
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:39,970
- That's the traditional form of sodomy.
- Right.

420
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,539
Did you do that?

421
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,875
I... I did. Yes, I...
That also occurred.

422
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,911
But you didn't spill your seed
in the rear end?

423
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,178
No, no, I did not.

424
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,647
Good, good.

425
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:52,216
I would spill my seed
on her... um...

426
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,819
On her back or on her bosom.

427
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:59,189
But most of the time,
she would request

428
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,759
that I spill my seed
all over her face.

429
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,197
Well...

430
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,701
These are serious sins.

431
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:14,104
And do you regret doing
these things?

432
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,607
I've learned my lesson,
I really have.

433
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,876
And I just... I don't want
to be that person anymore.

434
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,278
If I go back out on the road,
they will catch me,

435
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,780
and they will kill me.

436
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:26,784
Well, I'll give you
your penance.

437
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,753
- I want you to say 10 hail Marys...
- Yeah.

438
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,854
And 15 our fathers.

439
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,590
Yes.

440
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,592
Now, as to the other situation

441
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,728
about you being pursued,

442
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,366
I think I may have a solution

443
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,702
that can be a blessing
to both of us.

444
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,270
Yes, thank you, father.
Thank you.

445
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,243
- Good morning, Marea.
- Good morning.

446
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,979
- Is it a good time?
- Yes.

447
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,214
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
This is Masseto.

448
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,618
- He's a deaf-mute.
- Oh.

449
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,886
I met him on my trip
and spoke to his family,

450
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,956
and they explained to me that he's very
good with gardening, light carpentry.

451
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,225
I think he could help us
repair the cloister

452
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,227
and do all of the things
that Lurco was doing.

453
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,396
And I thought the fact
that he's a deaf-mute,

454
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:15,032
there would be a lot less
conflicts with the sisters.

455
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,368
I can't believe you met
a deaf-mute on your trip.

456
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,770
How was your trip?
Did you sell any fabrics?

457
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,672
We should talk about it
in private.

458
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,040
But you said
he was a deaf-mute.

459
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,743
Right. Um...

460
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,079
I was robbed.

461
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,314
Were you hurt?

462
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:30,314
No, no, no. I'm fine.

463
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:34,385
I wasn't hurt, but the bandits
took everything.

464
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,721
They took all the embroidery,
all of the silk,

465
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:37,721
so I made no sale.

466
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,958
- I've come back empty-handed.
I'm sorry.

467
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,895
What can I say?
I'm very embarrassed, but...

468
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:45,863
It's gonna be fine.

469
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:49,833
All right. Don't worry too much about it.
I'll get him started.

470
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,168
We go. We go.

471
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,416
Hi.

472
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,456
Who are you?

473
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,226
I'm sister Ginevra.

474
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,429
What are you doing?

475
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,835
You're digging a ditch?

476
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,071
You're digging a ditch.

477
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,914
All right.

478
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,821
<font color="#ff8040"><i>Since god is perfect,</i></font>

479
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:22,493
it's our job to live in unison
with his essence.

480
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:27,297
But sometimes it's difficult
to find that happiness

481
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,900
and things don't go our way.

482
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:33,804
And we feel like we're being
punished, and it's not...

483
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,975
Thank you, sister Fernanda.
Thank you.

484
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,042
Of course.

485
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:42,880
Um...

486
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,950
But god...
God is... is perfect.

487
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,888
Fernanda! That's enough!

488
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,557
- What?
- -This is...

489
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,325
Viola, go inside
and finish your reading.

490
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,263
Stop it! Stop that!

491
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,131
What are you doing?

492
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,834
I said stop that!
That is enough!

493
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,235
What's gotten into you today?

494
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:05,235
Nothing. I'm so sorry.

495
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:10,207
You know what? I'll just go scoop
some dung or scrub the cellars...

496
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,441
I don't know where
this is coming from!

497
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,377
And not bother you
while you walk in...

498
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,992
Did he just smile at you?

499
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:28,992
I don't know.

500
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,461
Why is he smiling?
Who is that? Wait!

501
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,197
Who the fuck are you?

502
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,898
Who are you?

503
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,133
Who are you?

504
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:36,133
Fernanda, stop!

505
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:39,369
He's an intruder. I don't
know who the fuck he is!

506
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,470
Let me get mother Marea!

507
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,072
Fine! Go!

508
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,074
Tell me who you are.

509
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,044
What? Say something!

510
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,313
Where did you come from?
What is that?

511
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,981
What are you doing
with your hands?

512
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,517
What? What, are you hungry?

513
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,886
What is that, a bird?
You're praying?

514
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,521
What the fuck are you
saying to me?

515
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,189
Fucking tell me who you are!

516
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,024
Don't chop his head off!

517
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,227
He's Masseto! He's a deaf-mute!
He works for us!

518
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,262
Father Tommasso hired him.

519
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,197
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about it.

520
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,499
You're always complaining
about how Lurco talks to you,

521
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,235
and Masseto doesn't talk.

522
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,157
So, I would really like you
to give him a chance.

523
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,039
Please!

524
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,575
All right.

525
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,577
All right.

526
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,547
And, sister, I need
to speak to you.

527
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,087
You can get up now!

528
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,455
He can't hear you.

529
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,924
Why are you defending him?

530
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,461
Now!

531
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,598
Father Tommasso was attacked
by a group of bandits, and...

532
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,634
- No.
- He...

533
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,004
Well, all the embroidery
was stolen.

534
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:56,146
So everything I've done, everything
I've worked on, is gone?

535
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,549
Yes, I'm afraid
that's what happened.

536
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,057
Are you all right?

537
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,192
Yeah.

538
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,260
It's...

539
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,397
I know this is a lot to...

540
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,299
To swallow.

541
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,137
I'd be more than happy
to get you

542
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:24,074
extra help for the work,
which will be doubled

543
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:27,110
to make up for everything
that was lost.

544
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,164
Hello?

545
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,337
Hi.

546
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,707
Um, I broke this.

547
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,510
Can you...

548
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,245
Fix this, yes?

549
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,182
You've... really kind eyes.

550
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,086
Sorry to just spring this
on you.

551
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,587
It's only 'cause they just
sprang it on me.

552
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,090
You know, they just asked me
to double production

553
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:21,825
of my embroidery out of nowhere.

554
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,627
And I'm basically
doing it alone.

555
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:25,162
They told me that they would
give me help,

556
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:26,530
and then they just stuck me
with this...

557
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:30,667
This, like, shriveled up, old,
comatose woman.

558
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,203
And, you know, I look at her,
and I just...

559
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,371
I see me.

560
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,239
That's what I'm gonna become.

561
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,108
I'm just gonna waste away here.

562
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,214
This is not what I imagined
for myself, you know.

563
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,285
What are you doing?

564
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,587
Why are you hiding in
the weeds like an animal?

565
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,556
I just saw sister Alessandra
go into the toolshed.

566
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,693
But I know he is not saving up
money for merchant Ricardo.

567
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,695
This is like...
It's not even his fault.

568
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,164
There's just no hope anywhere
in the world.

569
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,700
It's so sad and depressing.

570
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,569
There's no hope for any of us.

571
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,637
Yes, look at you.

572
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,308
Look at you. You can't speak.
You can't hear. It's not fair!

573
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,410
You're just stuck here
with all these bitches,

574
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,412
and so am I!

575
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,348
I just don't even
know what to do!

576
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,150
It's so unfair.

577
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,192
What the fuck
is she doing in there?

578
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,327
I have no idea.

579
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,200
Let us pray.

580
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,870
Lord, give our bodies
restful sleep

581
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:41,304
and let our work
we have done today

582
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,907
be sown for an eternal harvest

583
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,143
through Christ, our lord.

584
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,544
Amen.

585
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:51,348
Lord, Grant us a quiet night
and a perfect end. Amen.

586
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,787
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

587
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,223
It has been three days
since my last confession.

588
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,294
And what is it
you would like to confess?

589
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,397
Yesterday, I walked
by the garden,

590
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,798
and I picked a turnip
and I ate the whole thing,

591
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,634
and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

592
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,504
Hmm, and you regret this?

593
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,340
Yes, father.

594
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,309
Because it
was greedy, wasn't it?

595
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,610
- It was, father.
- Hmm.

596
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,281
Anything else?

597
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,516
Yes, father.

598
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,521
I've been having
impure thoughts.

599
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,357
Hmm.

600
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,859
And have you acted
on these thoughts?

601
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,427
No, father.

602
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,532
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

603
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,335
It's been two days
since my last confession.

604
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,204
And what do you wish to confess?

605
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:50,207
The other day, I found
a turnip in the garden

606
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,875
and I ate it all by myself,

607
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,710
and I didn't share it
with my sisters.

608
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,378
- And it was so delicious...
- Sister.

609
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,217
Ginevra just told me
the same story.

610
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,618
Did you overhear her confession?

611
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,622
No.

612
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,594
Fine.

613
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,462
Do you have anything else
to confess?

614
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,864
No. I have nothing else
to confess.

615
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,967
Well, you missed lauds, sister.
That's something.

616
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:19,803
Well, that's because the donkey escaped
in the woods, and I saved her.

617
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,605
You should be
thanking me, father.

618
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,374
Look, I'm just gonna...

619
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,645
I don't know what to do here.

620
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,647
If you don't confess,
god can't forgive you, so...

621
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:30,647
I have nothing to confess.

622
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:34,284
All right. Well, just go and
think about what you've done.

623
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,086
- Let's try it again next week.
- Yes, father.

624
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,328
First day.

625
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,530
First day. Thank you.

626
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,499
You survived.

627
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,501
Mmm-hmm.

628
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,003
How's it going?

629
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:55,939
Yeah, no... All the work itself,
it went really smoothly.

630
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,874
And I did a lot of great work
in the cloister,

631
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,410
and that was good.

632
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:05,048
And I met a few of the...
The sisters, and they were...

633
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,984
They were... they were,
you know, very interesting.

634
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,053
And just grateful...
Grateful to be here, so...

635
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,658
These girls can be tough.
I'm not gonna lie.

636
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,559
- They can be very tough.
- Really?

637
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,727
And violent.

638
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,596
Violence? I...

639
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,332
Wow, I just... I find
that so hard to believe.

640
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,466
They were...
They were so lovely.

641
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:27,003
They physically
have attacked people.

642
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,739
So, if anything happens,
just tell me.

643
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:29,739
Yeah. I...

644
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:34,577
Whatever it is, I can fix it,
but you have to tell me.

645
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,881
I mean, this deaf-mute thing
is there to protect you...

646
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,349
Exactly.

647
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,651
And to keep the sisters
away from you.

648
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,653
'Cause they can have
a pack mentality.

649
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,456
Ultimately, this is gonna be
a very positive influence.

650
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,492
Living ethically every day,
serving god.

651
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,661
It's really gonna fortify
your soul.

652
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,998
Yeah, you're right.
I think I can learn a lot

653
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,800
by watching the sisters
and everyone around,

654
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,835
who seem very ethical and, yeah.

655
00:38:58,837 --> 00:38:59,837
Cheers.

656
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,080
Actually, I was gonna ask you,
is it...

657
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,482
Is it all right that we keep
drinking the sacramental wine?

658
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,387
Well, I blessed it, so...

659
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,957
- You blessed it, so it's...
- I mean,

660
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,593
don't mention it
to anyone else, but...

661
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:26,062
How could I?
I'm deaf and mute, remember?

662
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,093
- Hi.
- Hi.

663
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,164
You're not going to bed,
are you?

664
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,600
No.

665
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,602
Do you have anything to drink?

666
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,783
What do you want?

667
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:22,051
Father Tommasso
left the Ambry unlocked.

668
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,631
Hi. I'm Marta.

669
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,034
She's my childhood friend.

670
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,156
- Yeah, yeah, childhood friend.
- We grew up together.

671
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,907
Are you drunk?

672
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,142
No. And...

673
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,610
Then you should have more.

674
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,547
Your room's gorgeous.

675
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,549
Yeah.
My dad got it for me.

676
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,218
Why is it so big? It's a
lot bigger than your room.

677
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,587
Is it?

678
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:58,888
I've never been in your room.

679
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,691
Yes, you have.

680
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,226
No.

681
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,998
Don't laugh.

682
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,104
What are you doing?

683
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:15,104
Nothing. Go back to bed.

684
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:18,741
- I can't sleep! You're too loud!
- Get outta here!

685
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,844
Get the fuck in here!

686
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,612
What are you doing here?

687
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:24,581
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you doing?

688
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,082
Who... who are you?

689
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,584
- Hi.
- That's Marta.

690
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,252
I'm Marta.

691
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:30,987
You have an accent. Where are you from?
The south?

692
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,856
- Oh, my god.
- Are you from umbria?

693
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:35,191
No. What's she talking about?

694
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,726
- I sound just like you.
- No. She's from here.

695
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:37,927
- You're not from Gartagnana.
- Yes, she is.

696
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,596
You do not sound like you're
from Gartagnana.

697
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,097
Are you drinking
the sacramental wine?

698
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:41,097
- Yes.
- No.

699
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,801
- Father Tommasso drinks it all the time.
- I'm gonna tell mother Marea.

700
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:44,801
I'm gonna tell mother Marea.

701
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:47,036
Why are you always
telling on people?

702
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:47,036
Why are you choking me?

703
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,839
Yeah, shut up.
Just drink a little bit of it.

704
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,174
Sister Alessandra wants you
to drink.

705
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,742
Ginevra, it's fine.

706
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,812
Nothing matters in life.
We're all gonna die.

707
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,547
Terrible things are happening
all the time.

708
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:58,848
You're not allowed
to have visitors here.

709
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,916
- You're not allowed...
- Just enjoy this moment...

710
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,551
We're all gonna die.

711
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:02,952
And just drink a little wine.

712
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,721
- But we're not gonna get in trouble?
- Do it.

713
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:05,788
Do it.

714
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,524
Whoo!

715
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,096
Oh, that tastes bad.
That's bad.

716
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,158
I think there was sand in it.

717
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:54,170
Is it true that you've never...

718
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,673
Been touched by a man,
or touched a man?

719
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,074
No.

720
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,176
Never?

721
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:00,176
No, never.

722
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:04,247
I feel sad for you. Do you
ever wonder what it's like?

723
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,849
Why? Is it really so great?

724
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,118
It's the greatest pleasure
on earth.

725
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,653
Really?
- Mmm.

726
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,622
Mmm.

727
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,726
Oh, my god, you have no idea.

728
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:19,862
In fact, it's so good
that I've heard of women

729
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,932
who make this potion
out of this plant belladonna

730
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:23,967
just to seduce men.

731
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,840
We can't do it, 'cause
we would get locked up.

732
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,810
Yeah, it's a mortal sin.
We wouldn't get into heaven.

733
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,278
It's a mortal sin.

734
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,713
Yeah, then you probably
shouldn't do it.

735
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,681
Probably shouldn't do it.

736
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:41,283
Doesn't really matter, anyway,
'cause we're never gonna know that.

737
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Nothing matters.

738
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,626
Are you really from Gartagnana?

739
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:50,927
Yeah. I am.

740
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,395
Mmm-hmm.

741
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,786
Hi, little one.

742
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,289
I don't feel well.

743
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,660
- I don't feel well.
- Yeah, it's 'cause this is too tight.

744
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:24,727
No...

745
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,429
Yeah, let's just...

746
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,197
I should go. I should go.

747
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,066
Okay. No, I'm sorry.

748
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,370
I'm sorry! But what is...

749
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,174
Oh, no, it's my room.

750
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,276
This is my room.

751
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,944
Yeah, it's your room.

752
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,050
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

753
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48,251
I'm sorry. I don't...

754
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,436
Hi. Um...

755
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,074
Hi.

756
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,042
Hi.

757
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,112
I made this for you.

758
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,882
For you, yes. Let me show you.

759
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,017
You can, um, sort of...

760
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,227
It says thank you, just for...

761
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,096
Just letting me talk
to you the other day.

762
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,164
I talk so crazy, I know.

763
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:38,901
I mean, you know, you can't,
you know, hear me.

764
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,071
Do you need help?
Do you need help?

765
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,139
I just...

766
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,077
Okay. Is that help for you?

767
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:52,815
Yeah.
Is that how you do it?

768
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:55,017
Okay. Okay.

769
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,186
Oh, I'm so dirty.

770
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,989
It's so warm.

771
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,159
It's so hot out here.

772
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,428
Just have to...

773
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,830
Oh...

774
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,900
That's better.

775
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,215
Sorry.

776
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,388
Sorry.

777
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,948
You're right. You're right.

778
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,950
That's too fast.

779
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,953
That's too fast.
We should stop.

780
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,056
Sorry.

781
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,893
Sorry. I'm sorry.

782
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,062
Okay.

783
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,530
Bye.

784
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,538
Glory to god in the highest,

785
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,841
and on earth,
peace to people of good will.

786
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,978
We praise you. We bless you.

787
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,081
We adore you. We glorify you.

788
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,318
We give you thanks for your
great glory, lord god.

789
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,854
Heavenly king, o god,
almighty father...

790
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,334
Last night was nice.

791
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,140
Are you tired?

792
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,208
Yeah.

793
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,544
Yeah, me too.

794
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,180
You feel okay?

795
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:05,214
No, I don't feel good.

796
00:48:05,484 --> 00:48:06,383
I had fun.

797
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:09,619
I said I don't feel good.
Can you please stop talking?

798
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,622
Well, okay.

799
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,093
Hi, ladies.

800
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,028
What are you doing here?

801
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,633
Um, I was just
in the neighborhood.

802
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,168
What?

803
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,104
I'm kidding.

804
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:31,007
No, my veil just got
a little dirty,

805
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,542
and I knew you girls were here,

806
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,611
and I thought I'd come visit

807
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,213
and wash it with you guys.

808
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:38,495
You're gonna wash your own veil?

809
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,953
Yeah. Why not?

810
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:45,221
You never wash anything.

811
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,458
Wasn't last night so fun?

812
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,927
How'd your veil get so dirty?

813
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,630
Um...

814
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,100
Well, earlier I was
in the garden,

815
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,536
and the new handyman was there
digging a ditch,

816
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,538
and I just thought
I'd help him out.

817
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,540
You dug a ditch?

818
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,542
It was actually...
It was really fun.

819
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,077
So, what do I do?

820
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,513
Do I just dip it in the...
In the water?

821
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,614
It's so... ooh, it's...

822
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,050
It's really dirty over here.

823
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,553
First you put it in the water,

824
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:20,323
and then you bring it over
to the bowl that has the ash.

825
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:22,391
And you put it in the bowl, and
you put the ash on top of it,

826
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,060
and then you let it
sit for a day.

827
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,661
So then tomorrow,
you would come back

828
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:27,163
and take it out of the bowl,

829
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,397
and then you rinse
it really well in the water...

830
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:29,598
And then you wring it out,

831
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,400
and then you hang it up
on the line.

832
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,570
Sounds like you are
really good at this...

833
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:37,039
So, maybe I'll just...

834
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,474
I'll leave it here with you.

835
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,576
This was great.

836
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:42,445
Thank you. Bye, you guys.

837
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,713
Bye.

838
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,350
Guess I would have ended up
washing this eventually.

839
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,622
Here. Finish this.

840
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,324
I have to go tidy up the cellar.

841
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,573
Here it is.

842
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,900
Yeah, there should be
enough here.

843
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,089
Sister Fernanda?

844
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,034
Just have to remember not to
get this in your mouth, okay?

845
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,301
I know.

846
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,177
Take off the nun thing.

847
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,378
You'll get it all over it.

848
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,715
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

849
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,620
All right.

850
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,171
Go for it.

851
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,791
Just going to...

852
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,828
Make you look a little more...

853
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,296
Presentable.

854
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,367
Do exactly
what I tell you to do.

855
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,520
Make sure he sees your eyes.

856
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,357
Okay, kiss him.

857
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,893
Kiss him.

858
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,863
Come on.

859
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,154
Okay, get closer.

860
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:39,355
Careful with the knife.

861
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,691
Take it all in.

862
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,233
Okay.

863
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,841
Get on top of him.

864
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,744
Push your sex into his stomach.

865
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,651
All right.

866
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:46,889
He'll do.

867
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:56,899
What were you doing in there?

868
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:57,967
Hi.

869
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,502
Where'd you come from?

870
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,838
I was just picking
root vegetables.

871
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,842
Are you really from Gartagnana?

872
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,545
Yes, I'm really from Gartagnana.

873
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:10,846
Why do you keep asking me?

874
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,281
You've asked me, like, 25...

875
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:13,549
You are the most annoying!

876
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,754
Are you ignoring me?

877
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,523
No.

878
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,525
- I feel like you're ignoring me.
- I'm not.

879
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,264
Can I ask you a question?

880
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:29,965
Yes.

881
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,402
Did last night
mean anything to you?

882
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,739
No.

883
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,941
We were just drunk
and having fun.

884
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,543
Forget about it.

885
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,589
All right.

886
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,724
Masseto, Masseto, Masseto.

887
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,459
I'm actually...

888
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,794
I'm all right right now.

889
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,062
Oh, all right.

890
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,497
Yeah.

891
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:02,731
How's it going?

892
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:04,300
It was a good day.

893
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:06,001
Yeah, I um...

894
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,970
I don't know. I can kind of...

895
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,706
I can kind of picture myself
maybe being here a while.

896
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,875
Really? You think
you could stay on?

897
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:15,010
If you'd have me, yeah.

898
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:16,679
Are you kidding?

899
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:19,014
That would solve
a lot of problems.

900
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,650
And how's it going with the sisters?
That's all right?

901
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,719
I think they're
kind of warming up to me.

902
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,988
Good. Good, good.
Not too much?

903
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,856
No. Definitely...

904
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,091
Definitely not too much.

905
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:31,427
It's the right amount,
feels like.

906
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:33,629
Anyway, let's have a toast,

907
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,998
just a quick toast...

908
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,766
And then maybe
head over to confession.

909
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:37,766
Yeah.
- You know, like we do.

910
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:42,071
I think I'm good tonight, just 'cause
I'm gonna... Feeling a little tired.

911
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:43,739
- It's been a long day.
- All right, yeah.

912
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,641
It's bad luck to put it
back in the pitcher, though...

913
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,509
So, let's just
have this one, and then...

914
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,488
Hello?

915
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,458
Are you alone?

916
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,892
- Of course.
- I thought I heard someone.

917
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:06,128
No, no, no.
I was talking to myself.

918
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,397
Let's take a little walk.

919
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,411
Bishop Bartolomeo, hello.

920
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:24,546
Father Tommasso.

921
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,748
Ah, it's good to see you.

922
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,516
Thank you.

923
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:28,984
- Come in. Come in. Come in.
- Hello.

924
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,019
Here. Let me take this.
You must be exhausted.

925
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,421
Very tired, very long trip.

926
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:33,555
So good to see you.

927
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,990
So good to see you, too.

928
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:36,058
Somewhat unexpected.

929
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:37,826
Looks great.

930
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,696
We'll get it together for you.

931
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:42,598
Oh, yes, I'm sure you will.

932
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,159
Oh, shit!

933
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,557
Knock-knock.
Are they not here?

934
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:16,758
- They disappeared.
- Oh.

935
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,495
And you know Alessandra,
Ilario's daughter?

936
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:20,662
Ilario's daughter, of course.

937
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:20,662
Hi.

938
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:24,600
- His business is not doing very well at the moment.
- Oh, that's terrible.

939
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:26,168
Sorry to say, yeah.

940
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,536
Yeah.

941
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:28,737
I want one of those.

942
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,005
We can get you one.

943
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:30,005
Yes, it's yours, it's yours!

944
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:33,242
- Thank you, sister Alessandra.
- Thank you.

945
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:33,242
- Nice to see you.
- We appreciate your time.

946
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:36,545
And we all went out to the field

947
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:37,667
and worked on a single plot.

948
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,576
I see your point,

949
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,278
but I'd like you to focus here.

950
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,680
No, but I'm fine with march.

951
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,683
In February, how did you sell
textiles before they were sold?

952
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:17,052
I like what you're saying,
and if you...

953
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,721
No. But this is march.
I'm fine with march.

954
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,824
Mother Marea, I need to talk
to you about sister Fernanda.

955
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,693
- Is she all right?
- Well, she's acting very suspicious.

956
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:26,128
And I've learned some things
I think you'd want to know.

957
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,996
You know how she's been saying
that the donkey escaped?

958
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:31,066
- It's not escaping.
- Okay, this is not the right time.

959
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:31,066
She's been lying about it
the whole time.

960
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:36,004
She's lying about it.
You'll want to know about it.

961
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:39,341
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Have you seen these numbers? Who...

962
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:41,944
I supervise in general...

963
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,712
The numbers, but...

964
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:43,712
There's something
going on with Fernanda.

965
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:43,712
She said that she was going...

966
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:48,884
- Sister, I'm asking, please keep your voice down.
- She wasn't there!

967
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:52,220
She was clearly lying.
She had a friend over,

968
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:52,220
and she drank alcohol.

969
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:56,358
- She's staying up! I hear her up all night.
- Don't talk so much...

970
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,630
She's clearly lying about
the donkey escaping.

971
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:01,630
Why would she lie
about the donkey?

972
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:04,666
I don't know why she's lying,
but I checked the walls,

973
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:04,666
and I checked all of the gates.

974
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:04,666
There's no way
that donkey's escaping.

975
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:09,738
I think that donkey needs someone
else to take care of her.

976
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,906
I can take care of her.

977
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,742
I will consider it.

978
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,624
- Thank you, mother.
- We'll discuss this later.

979
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,915
Isn't that amazing, sisters?

980
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,650
That rose had the ability

981
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:26,688
to predict the exact day
of the death of Frederick ii.

982
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:31,226
I think we all have this ability
to connect deeply with god.

983
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:34,062
I share the story, because we
don't always listen to god.

984
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,179
Hey!

985
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,115
What's going on?

986
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:28,817
You can speak?

987
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,354
No, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

988
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,456
I heard you. I heard you!

989
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:34,456
Tell me what's going on
right now,

990
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:39,027
or I'm gonna tell everyone here
that you've been tricking us!

991
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,929
All right, all right, all right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

992
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,998
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

993
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,299
You're not supposed to
talk to me?

994
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,168
What does that even mean?

995
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,770
Hello? Hello?

996
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:50,405
- Get down. Get down.
- Can you hear me?

997
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,774
Can you
hear me? Hello?

998
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:54,910
No, you can't hear me.

999
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:56,144
Can you hear my thoughts?

1000
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:58,080
'Cause I can hear your thoughts.

1001
01:01:58,082 --> 01:01:59,481
I can hear your thoughts.

1002
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,284
Hi.

1003
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,416
This feels different.

1004
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,418
I think I like sex with girls.

1005
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,953
I never told anyone.

1006
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:40,856
I have lots
of secrets. I'm Jewish.

1007
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:42,357
Nobody knows, but now you know.

1008
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,760
But you don't know,
'cause you can't...

1009
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:45,961
There's the angels.

1010
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:48,430
Do you see the angels?

1011
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:51,533
- I see the...
Oh, I hear 'em. I hear 'em.

1012
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:54,202
Oh, they know. They know I'm here.
They know I'm here.

1013
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:55,837
Oh, god. Okay.

1014
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,009
What are you doing here?

1015
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:03,145
I'm just looking
through the hay. Shh!

1016
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,493
- Fernanda! What the
fuck is wrong with you?

1017
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,395
Why is there blood
all over your face?

1018
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:54,397
Get out of my way!

1019
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,332
Fernanda? Fernanda?

1020
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:03,238
Over there. Come on.
They have the donkey.

1021
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,577
Oh, jeez. Are you okay?

1022
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,345
Are you okay?

1023
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,347
I'm gonna throw up.

1024
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,416
Okay, okay, okay. Let it out.

1025
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:16,284
I'm not gonna throw up.

1026
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,586
Okay, okay.

1027
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:20,055
Let's keep moving.
We're gonna keep going.

1028
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,090
- Keep going.
- I'm so hot. Why am I so hot?

1029
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:24,092
- I don't know.
- Oh, I'm so thirsty.

1030
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,327
Gotta keep going.

1031
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,377
What is the lights?
Look at the lights.

1032
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:50,085
What is it...

1033
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:53,121
- I took the belladonna. I took the belladonna.
- What?

1034
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:56,191
She had it. She had the sex, and
so I was gonna have the sex.

1035
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:59,060
- So I did belladonna
so I could have the sex...

1036
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,084
Witches.

1037
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:24,986
They're witches!

1038
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,622
He's making a lot of noise.

1039
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:29,124
It's okay. He's a deaf-mute.

1040
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,358
Yeah, well, maybe
we should gag him.

1041
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,626
There's no point.
He can't talk.

1042
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,663
Shut up.

1043
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,606
Ginevra, no.

1044
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,942
Ginevra, come back here.

1045
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:48,944
Ginevra, get back here!

1046
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:52,948
Stop!

1047
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,443
For so it was placed
when the goddess embraced.

1048
01:06:21,445 --> 01:06:24,212
The horned lord, our god
who taught her the word.

1049
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,381
Which quickened the womb
and conquered the tomb.

1050
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,528
Lance to grail, spirit to flesh,

1051
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,197
sun to moon.

1052
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:43,531
Forever your flame is the male.

1053
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:46,201
Don't fucking kill me.
No, don't, please.

1054
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:46,201
Don't fucking kill me!
I'll do anything, please!

1055
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:50,138
- We cured him. There's
absolutely no way.

1056
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:50,138
I'm telling you,
he was a deaf-mute.

1057
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,707
You know nothing.
This is a fertility ritual.

1058
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:52,707
You know, I told you to gag him.

1059
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:55,744
- It'll be great
if you just listen next time.

1060
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,047
Okay.

1061
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,293
What are you all looking at?

1062
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,630
Why are you looking at me?

1063
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,265
What is she doing here?

1064
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,434
What?

1065
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:33,281
Ginevra!

1066
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:36,151
Calm down.
Put the totem down!

1067
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:38,053
You do not belong here!

1068
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:39,220
Give it to me.

1069
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,288
You don't belong here!

1070
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,293
- No, no.
- You don't belong!

1071
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:50,665
Spirit to flesh, sun to moon.

1072
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:51,766
Quiet.

1073
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:54,636
Fernanda! Stop this!

1074
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:55,804
God, what are you doing here?

1075
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:55,804
I won't let you kill him!

1076
01:07:55,806 --> 01:07:58,573
Stop it, Alessandra!
I need to have sex with him!

1077
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:01,676
Why are you...

1078
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:03,645
Why are you even here?

1079
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:05,447
- You don't know
the powers of...

1080
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:18,226
You're a witch? This is crazy!

1081
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:20,128
And you were lying to us
this whole time?

1082
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,663
Yes, explain yourself!

1083
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:22,764
All right, all right, all right.

1084
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,799
These people,
they want to kill me,

1085
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:25,834
and I went on the run...

1086
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:27,168
This is my donkey!

1087
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:27,168
She's trying to take my donkey.

1088
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,371
- We have to get her.
- She's out of control.

1089
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:32,493
- All right, let's...
- Enough with the knife already.

1090
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,500
That fucking bitch.

1091
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,875
You need to know
what's going on!

1092
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:09,277
You need to know!

1093
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,487
Wake up!

1094
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,689
Wake up! Wake up!

1095
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,327
You need to know
what's going on!

1096
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:26,327
Just a minute.
I'll be right there.

1097
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:31,366
- What are you doing? It's the middle of the night!
- They're witches!

1098
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:33,301
They're witches!

1099
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:34,369
You need to know
about the witches!

1100
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:34,369
They're out there in the woods!

1101
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:37,705
- Put your clothes on.
- Fernanda's a witch, her friend's a witch!

1102
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,374
- Calm down!
- They're all out there! Father Bartolomeo,

1103
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:40,875
you need to know.
There are witches...

1104
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:43,211
She's a witch! She is a witch!

1105
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:44,812
- I am not a witch!
- Stop!

1106
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,548
- You're just jealous.
- No, I am not!

1107
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,849
Why are you wearing
your winter habit?

1108
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,684
- I saw him first.
- Why is the handyman here?

1109
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,553
What do you mean, you saw him first?
You don't even like men!

1110
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:52,954
You're sexually
attracted to women.

1111
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:54,756
I am sexually attracted to men.

1112
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:56,491
- What?
- I had sex with him!

1113
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:58,226
- You are a bride of Christ!
- You did not have sex with him.

1114
01:09:58,228 --> 01:09:59,327
You were just writhing
around on him.

1115
01:09:59,329 --> 01:09:59,327
- You had sex with him, too.
- Stop.

1116
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:03,731
- How dare you? Bishop, I did not have sex.
- I'm telling the truth.

1117
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:03,731
Why are you a tattletale, huh?

1118
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:06,401
I know what you're doing
and she's my donkey now!

1119
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:07,602
Don't talk about my donkey.

1120
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:08,770
I am on donkey duty now!

1121
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:09,671
What is wrong with her?

1122
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:11,472
She is on drugs!

1123
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:13,875
She told me
she took belladonna tonight,

1124
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,811
and she's been dancing around
naked in the woods with witches.

1125
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:18,479
And she's a Jew!

1126
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,819
I am not a Jew!

1127
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:26,621
Sister Marea!

1128
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:27,889
Stop talking.

1129
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,324
I am not a Jew!

1130
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:30,525
Yes! Stop. Stop.

1131
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,894
Sister Marea!
Sister Marea! Wake up!

1132
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:35,263
I'm not a Jew. I'm not a Jew.

1133
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:36,464
Come out here. Look at this.

1134
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:37,632
I was sleeping!

1135
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,434
- Complete chaos!
- I'm sorry.

1136
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,236
- Everyone's awake.
- What's on your face?

1137
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:43,504
It's the middle of the night.
There's a donkey downstairs.

1138
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:44,772
Why do you have
pants on your head?

1139
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:46,708
Okay, just please stop!

1140
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,344
I can explain everything,
all right? It's all my fault.

1141
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,411
I thought you couldn't speak!

1142
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:50,411
He can speak.

1143
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,249
- Yeah, he can talk.
- I thought you were a deaf-mute!

1144
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:57,552
It's a miracle.

1145
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,793
We're going to
begin the tribunal.

1146
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,747
Sister Ginevra,
these are your sins.

1147
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:27,015
Ingestion of drugs,

1148
01:11:27,017 --> 01:11:28,916
lying with a woman,

1149
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:30,385
not being baptized.

1150
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,787
Not being baptized?

1151
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,490
That's what
makes you what you are.

1152
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:37,932
You can't... you shouldn't even
be coming through those doors!

1153
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:42,830
Being a busybody,
filthy conversation...

1154
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:45,800
Vain jangling, drinking...

1155
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,502
Eating blood.

1156
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,622
Do you think I've ever written
down "eating blood" before?

1157
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,312
Where am I?

1158
01:11:57,314 --> 01:12:00,882
Envy, fornication,
homosexuality...

1159
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,517
That's the same
as lying with a woman,

1160
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:03,751
but we separate those.

1161
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:06,421
Lustfulness, reveling,

1162
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:08,323
mischief in your heart.

1163
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,093
That's the longest list
I've ever had...

1164
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:13,494
For sins.

1165
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,030
Please have mercy on me.

1166
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:17,432
For your punishment,

1167
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:19,033
I'm going to have you
fast for one year.

1168
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:19,667
Okay.

1169
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:23,771
- I didn't explain it yet, so it's not okay.
- Okay.

1170
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:26,474
Because a human being
can't live on not eating.

1171
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:28,576
- No.
- I don't mean you're not gonna eat for a whole year.

1172
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:31,379
You just pick a meal in the day

1173
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:33,748
- and skip it.
- Okay.

1174
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,617
So, say, it's lunch. Every
day, you've got to skip lunch.

1175
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:38,453
- Yes.
- And what meal is that?

1176
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,655
Uh...

1177
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:43,558
Based on your suggestion,
I'll skip lunch.

1178
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:47,829
It's not my suggestion.

1179
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:48,996
You have to feel the sin.

1180
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:50,465
I can feel lunch.

1181
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,133
Sister Alessandra.

1182
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,702
You know...

1183
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,537
I'm friends with your father,

1184
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,473
and now his daughter
is doing this?

1185
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,808
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1186
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,611
It's embarrassing.

1187
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:06,981
For me, I'm embarrassed. How do you think
he's gonna feel when he knows this?

1188
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:06,981
Please don't tell my father.

1189
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:10,785
- There's no need to tell my father.
- He's a patron of the church,

1190
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:11,953
one of the biggest.

1191
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,624
And this place is completely in disrepair.
It's falling apart.

1192
01:13:16,626 --> 01:13:18,893
It looks like a barn
in Filicaia.

1193
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,430
Have you been there?

1194
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,931
- It's disgusting.
- It's disgusting!

1195
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,900
Please, please don't say that.

1196
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,902
I think I want to call
this place little Filicaia.

1197
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,137
- No, please.
- I might.

1198
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:31,739
Sister Fernanda,
these are your sins.

1199
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,808
Apostasy,

1200
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,643
heresy,

1201
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,912
- abusive language...
- It's just the tone of my voice.

1202
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,580
Homosexuality...

1203
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,084
Revelings, witchcraft.

1204
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,653
Did you roll your eyes?

1205
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:46,754
No.

1206
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:49,991
You were rolling your eyes.

1207
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,028
Sister Marea,
I don't know what to say.

1208
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,997
I am shocked.

1209
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:58,633
Fornication?
Living in pleasure?

1210
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:01,436
You, sister Marea, you.

1211
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,204
Loving the world?

1212
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:04,839
Why don't you just stay here?

1213
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,475
Why don't you stay in this
world that you love so much?

1214
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:08,876
Isn't it fun?

1215
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,113
Do you have anything to say?

1216
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,182
I'm so sorry, your holiness.

1217
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,451
Do you care?

1218
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:20,555
It's just complete lack of...

1219
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:21,917
Are you guys
smiling at each other?

1220
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,226
Can you have a moment
to not look at each other?

1221
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:26,761
You're both out of control.

1222
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,798
Father Tommasso...

1223
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,200
I don't even know
where to begin.

1224
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,603
I ask your forgiveness...

1225
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,740
And I ask god's forgiveness

1226
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:42,543
for failing as the
Shepherd of this flock.

1227
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:46,781
I only ask that you please not punish the
sisters of this convent for my failings.

1228
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,988
Marea.

1229
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:57,825
I'm so sorry.

1230
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,629
He's taken away my priesthood.

1231
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,767
I have to go to San Biagio
and become a monk.

1232
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,703
I'm so sorry
for dragging you into this.

1233
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:10,705
You're a good woman.
You're a good woman, Marea.

1234
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,794
- I should...
- What the hell are you doing?

1235
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,911
Get outta here!

1236
01:15:16,913 --> 01:15:18,746
You were just crying in there?

1237
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,283
What's wrong with you?

1238
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:24,585
Was lying
with Francesca worth it?

1239
01:15:24,587 --> 01:15:26,087
I really don't
want to talk about it.

1240
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:28,656
What about that bosom?
Very ample.

1241
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:31,259
Super ample,
plus it's Bruno's wife,

1242
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:33,227
so it had to be so intense.

1243
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,929
Can you guys
please stop talking?

1244
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,664
You heard
what happened to her, right?

1245
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,165
No.
How could I have heard?

1246
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,675
"At the end of the cold season,

1247

1260
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,901
Did you finish
cleaning the cellar?

1261
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:48,135
Yeah, all done.

1262
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,238
Isn't it so annoying?

1263
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,974
- So annoying.
- I told you.

1264
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:55,843
I know.

1265
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:04,785
Sorry I told on you.

1266
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,957
Sorry that I told mother Marea
every time I thought

1267
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,360
something wasn't right or weird.

1268
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,230
Sorry I ruined your ritual.

1269
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,901
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was a witch.

1270
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,139
But honestly,

1271
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,209
I thought eventually I could
turn you all into witches,

1272
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:31,679
and you'd join my coven,
but I know that sounds stupid.

1273
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,347
You really think
I could be a witch?

1274
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:37,385
Yeah.

1275
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,727
Do you think
they're gonna kill him?

1276
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:55,670
I don't know what's going on
with Giovanni lately.

1277
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:58,272
Have you noticed the carrots they're
serving the soldiers are mushier?

1278
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:00,274
I was saying
the same thing yesterday.

1279
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:02,943
I would even be okay if they
were mushy on the outside

1280
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:05,112
and crispy on the inside. I don't
need, like, a full crisp, but...

1281
01:18:05,114 --> 01:18:07,014
It could be a little mushy.
I'm fine with a little mush.

1282
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,249
'Cause this is
basically carrot pudding.

1283
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:09,750
Where is he?

1284
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,395
Welcome back.

1285
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:29,270
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I've been in Sarzana

1286
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:31,405
meeting with the family
of my new bride.

1287
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,375
Beautiful young lady

1288
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,944
who seems like
she might be up to fidelity.

1289
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:38,279
Imagine that.

1290
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:42,149
Once she hits puberty.

1291
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:46,120
I have to thank you for doing
me an incredible favor.

1292
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:49,990
My wife, who had hidden
her Guelph ancestry,

1293
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:51,959
turned out to be

1294
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:54,095
quite the barren twat.

1295
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:55,830
And you've given me every reason

1296
01:18:55,832 --> 01:18:58,232
to seal her up in a wall
with a boar and a dog.

1297
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,369
I've got some good news

1298
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:03,971
and some bad news.

1299
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:05,473
Which would you like first?

1300
01:19:05,475 --> 01:19:05,473
I don't care.

1301
01:19:05,475 --> 01:19:10,478
The good news is I'm going to keep
you alive for as long as I can.

1302
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,915
It sounds cheery.
The bad news is

1303
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,418
it's only so that
I can inflict as much pain

1304
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:21,021
and degradation
as I torture your flesh.

1305
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:23,491
I'm having
a hard time determining

1306
01:19:23,493 --> 01:19:25,359
which of my favorite
torture methods

1307
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:27,194
to start with upon you.

1308
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:30,397
Got the thumbscrew.
I have a Catherine wheel.

1309
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,299
I have a rack out back.

1310
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,268
It was taking up
too much space in here,

1311
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,504
but still fully functional.

1312
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:38,439
There's a new one
called the rat box

1313
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,841
just in from Sicily.

1314
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:42,777
The rat box,
not to be confused with

1315
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:44,545
what I call
my wife's private area

1316
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:46,013
after you'd been to visit.

1317
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:49,250
It's a box of rats
with one open side

1318
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:51,018
placed against your abdomen.

1319
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,088
I light a fire on
the other side of the box,

1320
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,223
so that the rats,
in their attempts to escape,

1321
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:59,160
burrow through your guts.

1322
01:19:59,162 --> 01:20:01,796
Anyway, we'll have
a lot of fun together

1323
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:04,799
in the coming days
and maybe weeks,

1324
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:06,467
depending on how tough you are.

1325
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,805
Don't go anywhere.

1326
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,410
Shit.

1327
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:25,019
There was no good news
in that at all.

1328
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:29,089
Hey, um... I'd actually...

1329
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:30,825
I'd really appreciate it
if you guys let me out now.

1330
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:31,992
Oh.

1331
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,127
Can't do that to us.

1332
01:20:33,129 --> 01:20:35,029
- Please.
- It's a tough position.

1333
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:36,831
Hey, hey,
we're friends, all right?

1334
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,098
You don't want
to be here either.

1335
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,067
Just let me out.
We'll make a run for it.

1336
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:42,336
- I...
- We can't.

1337
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,071
He can't make a run
for anything.

1338
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:46,473
If I die,
that's on your conscience.

1339
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:47,975
You don't want to live
with that.

1340
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:49,310
Please.

1341
01:20:49,312 --> 01:20:50,578
What... is...

1342
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,480
Okay. You're gonna have
to move quick,

1343
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:55,182
especially around the moat.

1344
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,951
The guards out there
have a real thirst for blood.

1345
01:20:56,953 --> 01:20:59,486
Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.

1346
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:00,955
- Okay, here I go.
- Okay.

1347
01:21:00,957 --> 01:21:03,090
I'm unlocking you.

1348
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,627
What are you...

1349
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,495
There's a turtle
with a candle on it!

1350
01:21:08,497 --> 01:21:10,064
Really?

1351
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:11,432
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't leave me!

1352
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:13,100
Hey, where are you going?
Don't leave me!

1353
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:17,338
Come on! Just please.
Stop, you shits!

1354
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,139
- Let's see what he does.
- Shit.

1355
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,391
What are you doing here?

1356
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,393
We're getting you out. Hi.

1357
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:45,499
Come on!

1358
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,637
Come on. Come on.

1359
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:52,006
Whoa, whoa. Come on!

1360
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,941
No, no, it's okay.
I'm giving it to you.

1361
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:55,976
You can trust us.

1362
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:57,645
We're rescuing you!

1363
01:21:57,647 --> 01:22:00,347
I embroidered this doll
to put in your place.

1364
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:02,549
We brought you a lunar habit
to hide you in the night.

1365
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:04,151
We want to bring you back
to the convent.

1366
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,590
All right.

1367
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:10,925
All right, let's go.

1368
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:12,026
I'm gonna need that back.

1369
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:13,427
Put on the habit.
Key. Oh, key!

1370
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,202
Okay. All right.

1371
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,339
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1372
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,733
You think this has something
to do with our hair being cut?

1373
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,485
You think we should tell Bruno
about that?

1374
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:42,656
He's got his hands full with the
wife in the wall and everything.

1375
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:46,226
We just saw the wildest thing.
You would not believe it.

1376
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:49,263
Well, it was a turtle...

1377
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,637
Come on.

1378
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,272
Hello.

1379
01:23:32,274 --> 01:23:34,274
Tommasso.

1380
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:36,276
How are things at the convent?

1381
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:40,180
It's lonely.

1382
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:45,419
That monastery is so boring.

1383
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,790
All we do is pray.

1384
01:23:51,093 --> 01:23:52,693
I mean, it's important, but...

1385
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:56,230
It's all men.

1386
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,166
It's so good to see your face.

1387
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,177
Someone's coming.

1388
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,719
Come on!

1389
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,623
Come on.

1390
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,069
They're gone.

1391
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,183
All right, come on.

1392
01:24:49,207 --> 01:24:58,059
