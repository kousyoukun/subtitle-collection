SPRING, 1860
THE SAKURADA GATE INCIDENT

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,713
Grandfather! Hurry, hurry!

18
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,396
The pass at last.

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,910
A small shrine.

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,234
Grandfather, it's downhill from here.

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,919
Yes.

22
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,718
An exalted saint stood
on this spot many years ago.

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,190
He prayed

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,831
that the waters falling
to the east and west would be pure.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,514
Then he buried Buddha's image here.

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,319
The waters falling to the east
became the Tamagawa River.

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,831
Those falling to the west
became the Fuefuki River.

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
Flowing endlessly,

29
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,991
they helped the people
raise rich crops.

30
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,351
It's all downhill
from here on, Omatsu.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,111
We can reach Kochi by nightfall
and find an inn.

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,829
We'll be in Edo in three days.

33
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,713
The view is lovely.
Let's eat our lunch here.

34
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,712
Hand me your water holder.

35
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,269
That's right. I drank it all.

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,152
On the way up,
I heard the sound of water.

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,759
I'll go find some.

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,073
Be careful.

39
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,277
Save us, merciful Buddha.

40
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,473
If this old burden that I am
could only depart for the other world,

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,036
she'd be happy
and no longer a pilgrim.

42
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,398
Compassionate Buddha,

43
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,911
please be merciful

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,630
and take me to the other world now -

45
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,114
Old man.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,399
Are you a pilgrim?

47
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,431
Yes, I'm with my granddaughter.

48
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,631
Step forward.

49
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,078
Step forward and look to the west.

50
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,876
- A fine day.
- Wait.

51
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,959
Your face is unfamiliar.
Where is your home?

52
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,436
I'm Shichibei from Hikawa.
If you'll excuse me.

53
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,471
Grandfather!

54
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,034
What is it?

55
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,438
Grandfather!

56
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,154
What happened?

57
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,710
What a cruel thing to do!

58
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,072
Such an old man.

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,709
The work of an expert swordsman.

60
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,353
Grandfather!

61
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,197
- Young Master!
- What is it?

62
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,072
- A thief!
- What?

63
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,038
Disguised as a peddler!

64
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,637
No use going after him.

65
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,830
He's crossed the Daibosatsu Pass.
He's on the Koshu Highway by now.

66
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,030
He only stole 20 ryo.
Nothing to get upset about.

67
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,193
Ryunosuke, that was rash of you
with a match tomorrow.

68
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,239
Where did you go so early?

69
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,117
I took a leisurely walk
up to the pass.

70
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,391
Then you've made up your mind?

71
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,119
Let Utsugi win in tomorrow's match.

72
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,149
You were expelled
by Instructor Henmi,

73
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,873
so it's no disgrace to lose.

74
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,916
If Bunnojo Utsugi loses,

75
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,831
he can't be the successor
to the Kogen lttoryu school of fencing.

76
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,237
Moreover, if Bunnojo wins...

77
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,596
Lord ltakura will make him
the clan fencing instructor.

78
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,440
So not only Bunnojo,

79
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,269
but all his kith and kin

80
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,189
have staked everything
on tomorrows match.

81
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,677
You understand?

82
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,793
Lose to him with good grace.

83
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,318
Don't cling to the Kogen style.

84
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,354
With your skill,
you can master any style you want.

85
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,119
I don't fully understand
your sword form.

86
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,555
You draw out your opponent.

87
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,635
Then, in an unguarded moment,
you cruelly...

88
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,111
And the cruelty doesn't stop
with your sword.

89
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,876
It seems to have seeped
into your mind and body.

90
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,352
It frightens me.

91
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,391
A visitor to see Young Master.

92
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,272
No more contests today.

93
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,394
It's not a swordsman, but a woman.

94
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,959
A woman?

95
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,115
How do you do?

96
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,593
Are you Ryunosuke,
the young master of this fencing school?

97
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,075
Yes.

98
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,311
I am Hama, Utsugi's sister.

99
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,279
I'd heard he had a brother named Hyoma,
but as for a sister...

100
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,593
I am his sister Hama.

101
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,680
You wished to see me
about something?

102
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,716
It's about the match tomorrow
at Mount Mitake.

103
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,471
I can tell that my hus-

104
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,109
I mean,

105
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,554
my brother is very worried
about the match.

106
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,559
For the last few days,
he has been unable to eat or sleep.

107
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,319
My brother is no match for you.

108
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,956
You both studied at the Henmi school.

109
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,350
But he says your skill with the sword
is far greater than his.

110
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,472
I'm sorry for him
that you're to be his opponent.

111
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,752
I can't bear watching him.

112
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,160
And if he should lose

113
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,352
and be disgraced in the coming match,

114
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,998
he must renounce the Kogen School
and his position.

115
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,673
It would mean ruin
for the entire Utsugi family.

116
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,914
I came to plead with you
to be merciful

117
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,396
and save his honor.

118
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,479
Please!

119
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,231
It all depends on chance.

120
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,313
We must fight first.

121
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,870
Then you will not let him win?

122
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,192
Your concern
for your family and husband -

123
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,276
I mean, your brother.
I know how you feel.

124
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,877
But a match is another thing.

125
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,635
Even if I were to beg?

126
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,638
I, Ryunosuke Tsukue,
trust only my sword in this world.

127
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,998
When I fight, I have no family.

128
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,558
What a cruel thing to say!

129
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,597
You have no heart!

130
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,674
Hama...

131
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,272
a swordsman prizes his skill
like a woman prizes her chastity.

132
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,960
Even if it means one's family...

133
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,799
Even if it means
the ruin and death of one's family?

134
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,118
Would you surrender your chastity?

135
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,513
Who is it?

136
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,079
Excuse me.

137
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,115
Ryunosuke Tsukue told me to come.

138
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,554
He wishes to talk to me.
He said to wait.

139
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,030
Is that so?

140
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,830
But I don't see

141
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,637
why he has to talk
in a dirty place like this.

142
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,319
Please come and sit here.

143
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,199
I live alone, so I don't even
have tea to offer you.

144
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,352
It's all right.

145
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,633
I still have some work left to do.

146
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
<i>Yohachi.</i>

147
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,152
It's Young Master.

148
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,311
Yohachi, leave.

149
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,078
I must speak to her alone.

150
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,913
You're in the way.

151
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,318
But I've got work -

152
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,397
Do it later!

153
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,439
Leave.

154
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,036
Don't hurry back.

155
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,873
Hama.

156
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,953
Stand up.

157
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,435
I promise to let Bunnojo win.

158
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,719
Stand up.

159
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,832
Untie your sash.

160
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,639
Ryunosuke...

161
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,158
Untie it!

162
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,037
MOUNT MITAKE - COMMAND MATCH

163
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,637
UTSUGI, KOGEN STYLE,
VS. TSUKUE, FORMERLY KOGEN STYLE

164
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,555
Hama.

165
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,432
It's too early to start preparing.

166
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,516
If you're this nervous already...

167
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,677
Take this.

168
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,357
LETTER OF DIVORCE

169
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,911
A divorce?

170
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,190
We're divorced.

171
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,919
Go back to your parents!

172
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,355
If this is a joke, it's not funny!
Why must I?

173
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,919
Enough!

174
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,276
Ask yourself that.

175
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,159
Yesterday, you said you'd go pray
at a shrine for my victory.

176
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,156
You had Kyusaku wait
at the edge of the village.

177
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,197
Then where did you go?

178
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,394
Hama!

179
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,200
What were you doing all that time

180
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,991
alone with Ryunosuke in that mill?

181
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,274
I

182
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,595
Say no more!

183
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,511
You thought it smart
to go to his home!

184
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,552
Just when...

185
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,635
I'd found peace of mind by thinking,

186
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,598
win or lose, I'd abide by the rules.

187
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,432
But not now!

188
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,917
I'll kill him without fail,

189
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,392
even if we both die in the attempt!

190
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,039
Match!

191
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,797
Hijikata won?

192
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,234
I thought it was a draw.

193
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,237
No, he won.

194
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,999
No mistake.

195
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,917
Ohno's sword
may have looked like a sure win,

196
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,272
but it stopped short
of his opponent by two inches.

197
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,917
But Hijikata's sword came within
an inch of Ohno's shoulder.

198
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,557
No... half an inch.

199
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,514
Your observation is very keen.

200
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,836
I am Kamo Serizawa,
what's left of the Mito Tengu Group.

201
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
But that was long ago.

202
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,919
As time passes, our ideas change.

203
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,311
Our motto now is “Save the shogunate.”
We're on our way to Edo.

204
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,470
We hope men like you will help us.

205
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Your name?

206
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,997
Isami Kondo,
a country samurai from Bushu.

207
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,638
Bunnojo Utsugi
of the Kogen lttoryu school.

208
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,320
Ryunosuke Tsukue,
formerly of the same school.

209
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,077
Bunnojo Utsugi,

210
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,437
Ryunosuke Tsukue,

211
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,995
you both harbor no grudges?

212
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,557
Fight to the best of your ability.

213
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,875
Commence.

214
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,557
This is no match.

215
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,230
It's a duel!

216
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,075
A draw!

217
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,317
Neither side won! A draw!

218
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,593
Judge,

219
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,311
you call this match a draw?

220
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,598
Yes. Neither side won.

221
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,557
Are you too old to see?

222
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
What?

223
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,036
Before a draw was called,

224
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,114
he came at me
with an illegal <i>tsuki</i> thrust.

225
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,513
I parried and scored
a blow to the head.

226
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,158
See for yourself.

227
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,155
Ryunosuke.

228
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,239
Don't take this road!
It's an ambush!

229
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,637
Men of the Kogen school lie in wait.
Seven here, five there.

230
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,115
No one has grounds
for a grudge against me.

231
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,356
But 30 to 40 men are scattered about.

232
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,554
Why are you telling me?

233
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,638
Ryunosuke,

234
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,759
my brother -

235
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,953
I mean, my husband
Bunnojo Utsugi is dead.

236
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,558
Actually,

237
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,398
he divorced me this morning.

238
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,197
I have no place to go.

239
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,550
Please take me away with you.

240
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,154
Quickly!

241
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,636
Run away with me! Escape!

242
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,675
Ryunosuke!

243
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,154
You can't leave!

244
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,998
Not until we avenge Bunnojo!

245
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,878
You seek revenge?

246
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,718
Don't you know what for?

247
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
No.

248
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,473
What?

249
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,958
Utsugi died in a fair match.

250
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,151
No one should bear
a grudge against me.

251
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,874
If anyone calls me his enemy,

252
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,436
it should be Hyoma, Bunnojo's brother.

253
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,794
SPRING, 1862
THE SAKASHITA INCIDENT

254
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,156
RYUTARO YOSHIDA

255
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,079
It's only been two years,

256
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,192
but it's seemed longer to me.

257
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,239
After many twists and turns,
I've found a place in the sun.

258
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,759
I owe a great deal to you.
Let me thank you again.

259
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,278
By the way,
if things go well tonight,

260
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,392
I'll become
an assistant leader tomorrow.

261
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,750
Leader Kiyokawa promised me.

262
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,918
Who do we kill?

263
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,954
Kyosuke Kojima,
a survivor of the Sakashita incident,

264
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,640
and Totsuan Ohashi,
who's pulling the strings.

265
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,158
Ohashi's only a scholar,
so it'll be easy,

266
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,396
but Kojima's the Yashu clan's
best swordsman. He'll be hard to kill.

267
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,198
I thought of Kondo and Hijikata,

268
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,718
but we don't need
the aid of country clods.

269
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,511
Kiyokawa's place at 6:00 p.m.
Understand?

270
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,080
You keep taking jobs
that pay a pittance.

271
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,158
You become grimmer
and bloodier each time he visits.

272
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,758
In better times,

273
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,073
you'd have had a big fencing school
and we could have lived well.

274
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,592
You and I are outcasts,
but this child is not.

275
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,397
Dear, I don't care what becomes of us,

276
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,472
but this boy...

277
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,559
I wish to save lkutaro from misery.

278
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,753
So you hate being with me?

279
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,359
Never say the word
“outcast” to me again.

280
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,029
It's Boys' Festival,

281
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,717
yet I cannot even fly
carp streamers for you.

282
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,833
Let's at least offer
incense to Buddha.

283
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,879
You were born under an unlucky star.

284
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,392
We both suffer that way.

285
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,678
We'll offer Bunnojo incense in apology.

286
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,631
If nothing had happened
and Bunnojo and I were still together -

287
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,119
If I were his wife,

288
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,512
I would not live in misery
with a heavy heart.

289
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,511
Women are selfish creatures.

290
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,472
What?

291
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,359
You're to blame for everything!

292
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,791
If a villain like you
had never existed in this world,

293
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,037
Bunnojo would still be alive,

294
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,995
and both his family
and yours would be safe.

295
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,558
I would have lived
a happy life forever.

296
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,079
You're wrong.

297
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,469
This is all your fault.

298
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,590
You caused Bunnojo's death...

299
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,038
and brought about my ruin.

300
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,835
A woman named Hama
made it a violent match.

301
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,273
The tip of Bunnojo's sword
reeked of vengeful love.

302
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,112
My sword, too,

303
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,631
seemed possessed
by the spirit of an evil woman.

304
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,350
It all started
with a woman named Hama.

305
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,389
How dare you!

306
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,792
You're an evil woman.

307
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,395
No.

308
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,075
A devil.

309
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,597
I'm glad you said that!
Yes, I'm a devil!

310
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,912
I'll be one if you want it so much!

311
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,829
MY son! I'm going to die!

312
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,911
Die with me.

313
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,954
What are you doing?

314
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,878
Live or die as you like!

315
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,629
TORANOSUKE SHIMADA

316
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,831
That's enough. Next.

317
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,958
I bow to you!

318
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Excuse me!

319
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,439
A stranger at the entrance
requests a match.

320
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,760
Show him in.

321
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,034
Wait.

322
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,029
A man from another school requests
a match. Hold your practice.

323
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,552
I am Yoshida,
an inexperienced swordsman.

324
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,909
I would like Instructor Shimada
to teach me.

325
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,995
We have rules concerning strangers.

326
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,111
First you must contend with my pupil.

327
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,591
Yes, I know.

328
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,551
I'd like a match with the man who won
with a splendid doh attack just now.

329
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,274
You could tell just by listening?

330
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,874
Very well.

331
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,593
He's interested in your doh attack.

332
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,918
My assistant instructor.

333
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,759
I am fortunate.

334
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,069
Please put them on.

335
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,118
No need.

336
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,073
Then I'll do the same.

337
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,513
He won with a kote attack!

338
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,718
Please let me try once more!

339
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,229
No, that's enough.

340
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,713
Yoshida, was it?

341
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,075
You use a peculiar form.
Where did you study fencing?

342
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,670
I studied the Ono lttoryu style
under my father.

343
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,590
Other than that,
there's little more to mention.

344
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,798
Now I would like you to teach me.

345
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
Please.

346
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,511
I followed the rules
and had a match with your pupil.

347
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,840
Now I'd like a match with you.

348
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,316
There's no need for that.

349
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,558
Besides, I'm not good at doh attacks.

350
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,156
<i>I push, he retreats.
I retreat, he lowers his sword.</i>

351
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,029
<i>Seemingly off guard, yet alert.</i>

352
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,275
<i>How can I defeat his form?</i>

353
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,670
<i>I push, he retreats.
I retreat, he lowers his sword.</i>

354
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,319
<i>Perhaps only the</i> tsuki <i>thrust
can defeat him.</i>

355
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Excuse me.

356
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,711
You'll get wet there.
Please come inside.

357
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,676
But...

358
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,393
You can't stay out there.

359
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,110
It's just a shower. It'll clear up.

360
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,556
May I stand here a while?

361
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,231
I am Hyoma Utsugi,
Instructor Shimada's pupil.

362
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,555
<i>Omatsu!</i>

363
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,239
<i>What are you doing?</i>

364
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,113
Corning! Excuse me.

365
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,319
KORYU JIPPORYU STYLE

366
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,589
A flower teacher?

367
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,910
Who were you talking to?

368
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,354
A friend?

369
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,676
No.

370
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,914
A passerby. I felt sorry for him.

371
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,435
He looked like a samurai.

372
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,155
You mustn't keep bad company.

373
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,156
You're to serve a lord.

374
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,429
Yes.

375
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,349
But...

376
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,436
Spoiled child.

377
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,752
You're attractive enough
for a lord to notice you.

378
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,600
Then you could live in luxury.

379
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,671
But I'd rather not-

380
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,634
You're not a child anymore!
Don't be willful!

381
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,429
I've looked after you two years to -

382
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,520
What is it?

383
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,870
It's Shichibei.

384
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,673
Uncle?

385
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,314
Uncle? I like that!
He hasn't come by in ages!

386
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,198
Have him come in.

387
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,751
He says he's wet.

388
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,271
He wants to see Omatsu
in the kitchen.

389
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,755
This is for you from him.

390
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,111
Hurry and go then.

391
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Uncle!

392
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,872
Omatsu!

393
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,076
Sit down.

394
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,190
Was I away for eight months this time?

395
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,514
You've grown up while I was away.

396
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,358
I wish we could live together as family,

397
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,518
but I'm on the road so much
selling household goods.

398
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,632
It can't be helped.

399
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,036
You're on my mind, though,
no matter where I am.

400
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,036
There's something I must tell you.

401
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,598
We'd like to have a little chat alone.

402
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,475
And the rain's cleared up, so...

403
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,596
Have a nice chat.

404
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,039
Omatsu,

405
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,559
what is it you wanted to tell me?

406
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,236
Have you found a nice young man?

407
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,558
No, my flower teacher says
I'm to go to Lord Kamio's mansion.

408
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,797
Lord Kamio's mansion?

409
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,238
I believe she was the mistress
of the prior lord.

410
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,310
She hopes you'll catch
Lord Kamio's eye.

411
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,874
She's counting her chicks
before they're hatched.

412
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,393
Don't worry.

413
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,794
But Uncle...

414
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,319
She's a flower teacher,
so only women come here.

415
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,831
Lord Kamio's a Hatamoto,
so young Hatamoto samurai will go there.

416
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,196
You may meet a fine man.

417
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,629
Sooner or later...

418
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,915
you must marry.

419
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,595
It may be better
than just staying here.

420
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,514
Yes, but...

421
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,153
But what?

422
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
What is it?

423
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,559
Nothing.

424
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,637
If you say so,
I'll make up my mind to go.

425
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,320
Yes, that's best.

426
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,317
I'm staying in Edo a while.

427
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:27,551
If you go to serve Lord Kamio,
I'll visit you from time to time.

428
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,798
Please do come see me, Uncle.

429
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,673
Any minute now.
They'll almost here.

430
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,878
Ohashi and Kojima left Mito Mansion.

431
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,719
They'll be here soon.

432
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,916
<i>Any passengers left?
The boats leaving!</i>

433
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,669
Wait, boatman! We're coming!

434
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,391
What're they doing anyway?

435
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,800
Yoshida!

436
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,672
I'll wait on the boat.

437
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,871
<i>I'm quitting early tonight!</i>

438
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,714
<i>Hurry, please!</i>

439
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,797
<i>Or I won't wait!</i>

440
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,512
Wait, boatman!

441
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,990
Leader Ohashi!

442
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,080
- Kojima.
- What?

443
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,393
You're good with the doh attack.

444
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,639
Hama.

445
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,793
Any sake left?

446
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,752
Yes, a little.

447
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,430
Give me what's left.

448
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,870
<i>Shionoyama.</i>

449
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:09,677
<i>Sashide's shore.</i>

450
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,594
You know it?

451
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,795
It's about my village.

452
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,990
Shionoyama means Salt Mountain.

453
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,876
Sash/de means
the banks of the Fuefuki River.

454
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,554
It's between Yahata, my hometown,
and Kusakabe.

455
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,033
My father loved the bamboo flute too.

456
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,709
He was a stubborn swordsman.

457
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,474
The sword was all he knew.
But strangely enough, he loved the flute.

458
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,190
I learned to play a little
from watching him.

459
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,396
He was sick when I left home.

460
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,392
Is he well now, or has he died?

461
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,838
Shall we go home to Sawai once?

462
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,636
We'll go by way of Koshu,
not the Ohme Highway.

463
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,040
From Yahata, your home village,

464
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,273
we'll go over the Daibosatsu Pass.

465
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,590
I'd be happy t0 90-

466
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,240
But what if something should happen?

467
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,232
No need to worry.

468
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,072
It was just a fencing match.

469
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,117
No one would hold a grudge
for that long.

470
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,639
Wait... Bunnojo had a brother.

471
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,235
He came to Edo as a boy

472
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,390
to enter the Otani school
in Koishikawa.

473
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,314
There is no Hyoma Utsugi
at that fencing school.

474
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,272
It made me uneasy,
so I checked on his whereabouts.

475
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,676
Then he must have gone home.

476
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,311
The others may not go home,

477
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,835
but from what happened,
I'm sure he will.

478
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,916
Hyoma Utsugi.

479
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,550
Let him come after me.

480
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,151
Instead of finding revenge,
he'll die by my sword.

481
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,753
Poor man.

482
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,877
If I killed him,
you'd feel sorry for him?

483
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,155
No.

484
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,836
I have no one to depend on but you.

485
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,117
You mean more to me than anyone else.

486
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,389
But to kill Hyoma,
who's done nothing...

487
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,353
That would be cruel.
I hope it never happens.

488
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,717
You're early.

489
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,640
I spent all night gambling.

490
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,800
There was a suspicious fellow
at your gate.

491
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,670
A clean-cut man of <i>25</i> or 26,
carrying fencing gear?

492
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,754
Is there something between you?

493
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,153
It's not me he's after. It's Omatsu.

494
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,238
But she's at Lord Kamio's place.

495
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,349
He peeks in twice a day
when he passes by.

496
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,118
He doesn't know she's gone.

497
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,669
A curious, stupid-looking fellow.

498
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,833
Is Omatsu all right?

499
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,915
Why?

500
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,829
Rumor has it.

501
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,678
Lord Kamio's a woman-hater.

502
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,759
Until now.

503
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,634
But he's his father's son, after all.

504
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,995
Sooner or later,
he'll find he can't do without them.

505
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,278
That is, if Omatsu's near him.

506
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,355
I see what you mean.

507
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:50,509
I should tell the elders to transfer
the Shincho Group to Kyoto?

508
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,399
Yes, if you would.

509
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,596
What will you do in Kyoto?

510
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,596
Masterless samurai are up to something.
We must stop it.

511
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,510
Leader Kiyokawa thinks differently.

512
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,672
He's neither a leader
nor even a member any longer.

513
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,079
He plays both sides.
Don't believe him.

514
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,917
I'll get rid of him soon.

515
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,158
I'm not interested in politics.

516
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,078
Lord Kamio, doesn't the shogunate's
weakness concern you?

517
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,629
It won't fall.

518
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,714
If it falls, it falls. Let it.

519
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,198
Things will happen,
regardless of what we do.

520
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,392
Enjoy yourselves until then.

521
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,513
I'll serve some sake.
Relax a little.

522
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,957
The Shincho Group
takes things too seriously.

523
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,550
No, we have a meeting.

524
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,919
I see.

525
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,435
I'm sorry I wasn't of any help.

526
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,350
Just as I thought, he's a monster!

527
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,950
I thought he had guts!
He's rotten!

528
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,675
“Enjoy yourselves until then.”
How dare he!

529
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,551
Talking like a man when he can't
even make advances to women.

530
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,356
Yoshida!

531
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,874
What is it?

532
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,397
I'm staying behind.
You go on ahead.

533
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,556
I have some business to see to.

534
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,359
You go on ahead.

535
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,158
Yohachi.

536
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,031
Young Master!

537
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,479
What are you -

538
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,469
I mean, why are you here?

539
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,035
What choice did I have?

540
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,349
What?

541
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,075
Master died.
How could I stay in Sawai?

542
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,680
Father?

543
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,870
I was an orphan as a child.

544
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,192
Master took me in.

545
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,477
I watched over his water mill.

546
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,671
So when he died -

547
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,870
When was it?

548
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,116
It's all your fault.

549
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,798
About 20 days after the match
at Mount Mitake,

550
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,876
Hyoma returned to Wada.

551
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,150
Master called the brother
of the man you killed

552
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,875
to his bedside!

553
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
What?

554
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,153
Hyoma.

555
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,832
With your own hands,

556
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:32,029
kill Ryunosuke as soon as possible.

557
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,193
If only he had never been born!

558
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,677
He should never have held a sword.

559
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,716
He allowed his obsession
with the evil sword

560
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,039
to corrupt and pull him down.

561
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,557
There is no way to save him.

562
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,277
The sooner he dies,

563
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,671
the sooner people
can live in safety once again.

564
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,593
But your skill with the sword
is not enough yet to -

565
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,436
I hear you're studying
at the Otani school,

566
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,440
but Otani's an old man now.

567
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:34,475
I'll write a letter
explaining everything in full.

568
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,518
Take it to the Shimada school
in Okachimachi.

569
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,076
Shimada teaches
the Jikishin Kage style.

570
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,593
Only he can make you
as strong as Ryunosuke.

571
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,956
He alone can achieve this.

572
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,833
HYQITla!

573
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,036
Join Shimada's school.

574
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,671
As soon as possible,

575
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,669
kill Ryunosuke with your own hands.

576
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,039
I understand.

577
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,354
Yohachi.

578
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,197
Tell Hyoma Utsugi for me

579
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:36,355
that his enemy Ryunosuke
lives behind Shiba likura.

580
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,360
He is now known as Ryutaro Yoshida,

581
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,038
and he helps
the Shincho Group for money.

582
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,433
If he challenges me,
I'll fight anytime.

583
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,275
Tell him I'm sorry,
but I'll slay him with one stroke.

584
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,951
No, I won't!

585
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,549
I hate killings! No!

586
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,552
I won't kill you, Omatsu.

587
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,156
It's a game - the bamboo game.

588
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
Bamboo?

589
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,038
We'll pretend you're the bamboo.

590
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,038
Understand?

591
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,119
Of course you don't.

592
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,710
Naturally you wouldn't understand.

593
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,079
Bamboo, with so many layers of covering,
can't see - like the masses.

594
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,279
Loyalists, shogunate supporters -

595
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:37,079
each time they flash their steel,
a layer comes off.

596
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,639
It's a nuisance.

597
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,432
But Omatsu...

598
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,950
the more stupid the game,
the more fun it becomes.

599
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,593
Here I come, bamboo!

600
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,273
Omatsu.

601
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,875
I won't be able to play
these games much longer.

602
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,037
The samurai class, like a heavy log,
will soon sink from its own weight.

603
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,233
The bamboo will grow
and become strong.

604
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,270
Now's the time.

605
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,159
First my sword will cut your sash.

606
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,510
And now your band!

607
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,317
It's a difficult thing to cut.

608
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,791
Here I go!

609
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,959
Intruder!

610
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,230
Omatsu, I was wrong!

611
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,317
Run from this monster's house!

612
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,914
Ryutaro Yoshida is Ryunosuke Tsukue?

613
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,599
Yes.

614
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,159
I thought his was a strange style.
That's the silent form?

615
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,360
Yes.

616
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,271
Then he knew who you were
and he came to test you?

617
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,040
No, it was just by chance.

618
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,074
I suppose so.

619
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,715
To defeat his form -

620
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,998
There's only one way.
The <i>tsuki</i> thrust!

621
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,954
Master.

622
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,839
Hyoma.

623
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,957
You haven't the slightest chance
of defeating Ryunosuke yet.

624
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,034
Leave your place.
Shut yourself up here.

625
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,476
You must not go out.

626
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,197
Mastery of the sword cannot be taught.
You must find it yourself.

627
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,233
You understand?

628
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,679
As you said, only the <i>tsuki</i> thrust
can defeat him.

629
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,993
Your brother probably tried it
against him too.

630
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,397
But if it's done poorly,

631
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,393
he'll turn it against you
in one final blow.

632
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,031
From now on, work only on how
the <i>tsuki</i> thrust can defeat him.

633
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,830
No matter when you challenge him,

634
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,477
Ryunosuke's not
the type of man to run away.

635
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,874
She's gone?

636
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,359
Madam.

637
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,553
Is Omatsu gone?

638
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,875
She left Lord Kamio's place
after about ten days.

639
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:00,111
So I sent her
to a merchant family as a maid.

640
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:07,431
You told me about that
when I came in early autumn.

641
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,599
They graciously said she was a good worker,
and she was happy there.

642
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,754
Then she returned suddenly
last month.

643
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,269
I asked her why,
but she wouldn't say.

644
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,314
I got angry
and treated her harshly.

645
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,600
Then about ten days ago,
when I got up,

646
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,429
she was nowhere
to be found in the house.

647
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,953
It made me so mad and bitter.

648
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,594
She's such a bother!

649
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,593
I asked you to look after her.

650
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,516
Just telling me she's gone
doesn't help -

651
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,392
Are you trying to blame me?

652
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,596
You were named her guardian.

653
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,272
So as her guardian, bring her back!

654
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,351
I'm sorry.
It was a slip of the tongue.

655
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,278
Don't be offended.

656
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,199
But where'd she go?

657
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,035
Have you any idea where she went?

658
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,431
If I knew, I'd bring her back.

659
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,712
She probably found a man

660
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,029
and went to his place.

661
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,877
They're at Sugiyama's home
in Marunouchi?

662
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,119
No mistake about it.
Saura, a friend, is there.

663
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,032
He told our scout Aoyama.

664
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,754
Who else is there?

665
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,357
Lord Takahashi, Yamaoka,
lshizaka, Azurni,

666
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,958
and Kiyokawa, the man we want.

667
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,079
Very well.
We'll take care of him tonight.

668
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,554
Otherwise we can't leave for Kyoto
with peace of mind.

669
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,280
Yoshida,

670
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:56,273
you can make full use
of your silent form tonight.

671
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,399
But let's have a drink first.
Pour one for Yoshida.

672
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,994
Please.

673
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,879
Was that a mouse?

674
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,118
That noise downstairs.

675
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,310
It's nothing.
Snow falling from the roof.

676
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,193
Cold night, isn't it?

677
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,520
Thief!

678
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,554
I came to thank you.

679
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,198
Thanks for the rude reception today!

680
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,840
You're -

681
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,232
Yes, a scoundrel who breaks laws.

682
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,149
Just once,
to make up for my crimes,

683
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,749
I saved her at Daibosatsu Pass.

684
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,629
But my feelings for her have deepened.

685
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,310
Now I feel like her real father.

686
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,390
I wanted money to retire.

687
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,391
I looked forward
to holding her children in my lap!

688
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,477
Where'd you hide her?

689
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,758
I told you everything earlier.

690
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,994
I see.

691
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,914
Very well.

692
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,230
In that case, I'll shame you good.

693
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,638
I'll strip you and tie you up,

694
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,198
and I'll put the two of you
out on the street.

695
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,118
Spare me!

696
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,719
I'll tell you!

697
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,719
I sold Omatsu to a place in Kyoto!

698
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,674
What's that?

699
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,319
<i>KY Mg'?</i>

700
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,836
He brought a buyer.

701
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,790
She'd be easily found in Edo,
so we decided on Kyoto.

702
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,071
Where in Kyoto?

703
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,640
Shimabara!

704
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,512
You wench!

705
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,629
Sinking Omatsu
into a mire like that,

706
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,352
and my dreams as well!

707
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,038
He left Sugiyama's place?

708
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,151
Yes, we're lucky.

709
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,670
Two palanquins left the house.

710
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,831
Kiyokawa is in the second one.

711
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
You sure?

712
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,670
Saura said,
“Two palanquins will leave.

713
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,837
Our man will be in the second one.”

714
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,157
- Who's in the first one?
- Lord Takahashi.

715
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,351
Takahashi?

716
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,076
The foremost lancer in Japan.

717
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,872
Who's afraid?
Let's kill both of them!

718
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,913
No, we're after Kiyokawa alone.

719
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,199
We'll follow them.

720
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,195
When they part,
we'll attack Kiyokawa.

721
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,556
And if they don't?

722
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,870
Then we'll kill them both.

723
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,554
Very well. It's settled.

724
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,876
Our leader has to see
Superintendent Nishino

725
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,032
about setting out for Kyoto,

726
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,677
so I'll give the order
to kill Kiyokawa.

727
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,351
Takahashi's gone his own way.

728
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,917
- Leader!
- Not yet!

729
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,994
Not here in town.
We'll chase them to Mount Ueno.

730
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,480
NOW!

731
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,590
What is this? A joke?

732
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,989
Come out!

733
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,878
I am Shimada of Okachimachi.

734
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,039
If this is a challenge,
name the time and place!

735
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,438
If it's a grudge, state your reason!

736
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,880
We've made a mistake!

737
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,159
You make a mistake
and act rudely all the same?

738
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,874
State your names and motives,
and then apologize!

739
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,751
Who are you? Your name!

740
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,880
Kill me!

741
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,037
You're the leader, it seems.

742
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,950
You hot-headed men
made me kill against my will!

743
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,995
The men lying here
were good swordsmen.

744
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:24,557
Now they've died like dogs!
How will you atone for it, you fool?

745
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,790
Kill me!

746
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,912
It's the worst mistake I ever made!
Kill me!

747
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,911
The sword is the soul.

748
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,113
Study the soul to know the sword.

749
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,711
Evil mind, evil sword.

750
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,950
The Shincho Group's going to Kyoto!

751
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,954
Ryunosuke may accompany them.

752
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,549
Master!

753
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,350
You're not strong enough.

754
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,792
But if he goes to Kyoto,
it will be hard to kill him.

755
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,271
At the moment,
he's lost confidence in his sword.

756
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,992
Don't ask me why.

757
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,073
Now's the time.

758
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,113
Remember that both of you may die,

759
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,880
but the <i>tsuki</i> thrust
may give you a slight edge.

760
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,676
Send him a letter of challenge.

761
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,837
He lives at Shiba likura.

762
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,000
What date?

763
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,833
Tomorrow, the 16th.

764
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,999
The pine grove
to the right of Zojoji Temple.

765
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,829
At 6:00 a.m.,
to avoid encountering others.

766
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,840
Hama.

767
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,314
Give me some sake.

768
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,193
It's all gone.

769
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,630
You've been acting strangely
since last night.

770
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,440
<i>Mutate has a com,
yet you went out.</i>

771
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:34,476
What were you doing out so late
in the heavy snow?

772
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,831
He's fast asleep.

773
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,913
I hope he grows up safely.

774
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,993
Of course he will.

775
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,355
Won't you, son?

776
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:08,236
Children grow up
even without parents, they say.

777
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,319
Don't say that! It's unlucky!

778
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,634
One day.

779
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,837
One day, I promise.

780
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,275
Hama.

781
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,476
I'm going to Kyoto soon.

782
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,473
<i>KY Mg'?</i>

783
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,278
With Serizawa and the Shincho Group.

784
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,158
What will become of us?

785
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,873
No! You mustn't go!

786
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,798
Why these sudden decisions?

787
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,877
Don't you ever think
of lkutaro and me?

788
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:55,392
You don't care what becomes of us.

789
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,316
But whose child is lkutaro, after all?

790
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,951
And now, when he's so sick.

791
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,551
What if he becomes worse and dies?

792
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,919
Are you saying you don't care?

793
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,313
Dear,

794
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,838
you're going to abandon us,
aren't you?

795
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:33,359
I thought it might come to this.

796
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,113
But it's too cruel, too brutal!

797
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,753
Please, do me a favor.

798
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,433
I can't stand the prolonged agony.

799
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,992
Please divorce me!

800
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,520
No.

801
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,516
We're not formally married.

802
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,829
I need no divorce papers.
I'm leaving!

803
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,239
Where will you go?

804
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,431
You can't tell me what to do.

805
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,434
It's not that.

806
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,680
I wanted to give you a farewell gift,
but I have none.

807
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,309
So a word, before we part.

808
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:53,039
Tomorrow morning at 6:00,
near Shiba Zojoji Temple,

809
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,594
I will kill Hyoma Utsugi.

810
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,758
Is this what arrived this evening?

811
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,719
Hyoma's challenge.

812
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,439
Bunnojo, now Hyoma.

813
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,314
I'll end up killing
both the Utsugi brothers.

814
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,959
Yes, do that!

815
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,437
That's how you are!

816
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,551
Kill Hyoma!

817
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,273
Kill everyone!

818
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,355
Kill everyone in the world!

819
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,830
Not everyone.

820
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,952
But my sword will get
Toranosuke Shimada

821
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,439
one of these days.

822
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,712
Hyoma will be child's play.
I'll torture him to death.

823
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,838
Sun up?

824
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,359
You told Yohachi, the mill guard,
in place of his master?

825
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,150
Yes, to be here at 4:00 in the morning.

826
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,595
You can't sleep
because you're intent on winning.

827
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,036
Don't think about winning or surviving.

828
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,557
Be prepared to die.

829
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,680
Risk everything,
and you may have a chance.

830
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,230
Go lie down with a calm mind.

831
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,589
Ryunosuke's form
may be about to meet defeat.

832
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,035
What are you doing?

833
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,712
Madwoman!

834
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,593
Was that for Hyoma's sake?

835
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,511
No, you're wrong.

836
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,635
You're wrong.

837
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,520
What?

838
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:38,193
I wanted to kill you.

839
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,791
I hated you.

840
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,110
Ikutaro and I could be happy

841
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,676
if it weren't for you.

842
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,629
But...

843
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,874
but not now.

844
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,597
It doesn't matter.

845
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,399
Dear.

846
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,911
Ryunosuke.

847
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,190
Please kill me here.

848
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,392
Kill me here.

849
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,474
I will die at your hands

850
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,190
so that you may die at Hyoma's.

851
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,834
One will make recompense
for the other...

852
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,309
and it will make amends for your sins.

853
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,194
Dear.

854
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,440
Ryunosuke.

855
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:59,310
SPRING OF 1863
THE SHINSEN GROUP IS FORMED

856
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,309
You don't want to return to Edo?

857
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,669
No.

858
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:51,838
I don't have any relatives there.

859
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:55,835
So you insist on becoming a courtesan?

860
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:03,718
I'll be Miyuki the courtesan's sister
at Kizuya the end of this month.

861
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,038
It can't be helped if you've decided.

862
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:16,276
But I wouldn't have saved you
if I'd wanted you to become a courtesan.

863
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,509
Still...

864
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:26,480
it isn't easy for me
to raise 200 pieces of gold.

865
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,678
Don't, Uncle.
You've already done enough for me.

866
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,359
No, I haven't.

867
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:36,871
I do business in Osaka and Sakai.
I'll see what I can do.

868
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,513
Don't become a courtesan yet.

869
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,392
Excuse me, Omatsu.

870
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,114
A young samurai wants to see you.

871
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,710
- A samurai?
- Yes, a young traveler. Will you see him?

872
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,759
Well...

873
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,078
He doesn't think you'll remember him.

874
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,430
He said he met you in Edo.

875
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,836
Who is it?

876
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,231
I don't know.

877
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,751
Don't worry. Ask him in.

878
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,639
I must be going.

879
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,390
Please, Uncle, can't you stay?

880
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,240
You met in Edo.
You don't remember him?

881
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,751
No, I'm afraid I don't.

882
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,719
Excuse me. One rainy day, I-

883
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,153
I remember.

884
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,955
Your name's Utsugi.
You were at the Shimada school.

885
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:36,238
Please come in.

886
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,152
This man is like my real father.

887
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,759
Please.

888
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,759
Don't stand on formality.

889
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,993
So you two know each other from Edo?

890
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:57,511
No, we only met once.

891
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,033
Just once?

892
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:05,314
I had to come to Kyoto on business.

893
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,558
I was surprised
when I saw you here unexpectedly.

894
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,034
What is your business here?

895
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,356
There's someone I must see.

896
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,518
- I'd better go.
- No, Uncle.

897
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,153
I'm leaving soon.

898
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:23,399
You said you came to see someone.

899
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,477
Will you be staying in Kyoto long?

900
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,319
I don't know yet.

901
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:34,270
So you're actually searching
for this person, aren't you?

902
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,913
Well, yes.

903
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,312
That could be difficult.
Have you any idea -

904
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,239
Yes, but it's not much to go on.

905
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:49,231
Pardon my asking,
but is this person a samurai or -

906
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,829
It's rather complicated.

907
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,998
Omatsu, tonight's party
will be at Tsuchiya.

908
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,952
Men from the Shinsen Group?

909
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,310
Yes, the Mibu rowdies.

910
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,155
Omatsu!

911
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,353
You know the Shinsen Group?

912
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,480
Yes.

913
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,754
Assistant Leader Kondo
favors the courtesan Miyuki.

914
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,679
Mr. Utsugi,

915
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:21,751
does the man you're looking for have
anything to do with the Shinsen Group?

916
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,238
If there is anything I can do,

917
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,869
don't hesitate to ask.

918
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:36,559
She's saying she'll do
anything for you.

919
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,919
Don't hold back with friends.

920
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,514
Ryutaro Yoshida's supposed to be
among the group at Mibu,

921
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,597
but he's not there.

922
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,751
Ryutaro Yoshida.

923
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:55,596
His real name is Ryunosuke Tsukue.
He's from Sawai.

924
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,956
From Sawai?

925
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,754
Ryunosuke Tsukue?

926
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,360
Mibu men! The Shinsen Group!

927
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,232
We've come from Mibu!

928
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,515
The more you tell me,

929
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,553
the more a villain he seems.

930
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,437
A man from hell.

931
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,556
The world's full of villains,

932
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,280
but he beats them all.

933
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,754
Please don't worry.

934
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,112
Omatsu's gentle but bright.

935
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,999
She'll ask without rousing suspicion.

936
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,119
Did Omatsu send you?

937
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,879
Yes, I have a message.

938
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,839
I see. Some tea?

939
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,155
I'm in a hurry.

940
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,640
What's the message?

941
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,636
A guest named Yoshida
is at the party.

942
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,030
I see. Thank you.

943
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,669
When does the party end?

944
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:13,153
It's just begun. Perhaps about 10:00.

945
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,399
10200?

946
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,796
- Thank you.
- Thanks!

947
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,439
Now that you know he's there,
what will you do?

948
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,994
I'll kill him tonight.

949
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,195
Tonight?

950
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:30,159
If not tonight,
I'll have to find him again.

951
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:34,359
I'll follow him to a lonely spot
and then stop him.

952
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,433
I wonder.

953
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,560
What?

954
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,753
He's no ordinary man.

955
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,993
He'd notice if you followed him.

956
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,989
Attack when he comes out.
That's your only chance.

957
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,554
Yoshida.

958
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,152
You must show me
your silent form soon.

959
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,472
The Kyoto governor was so weak,
we couldn't do a thing.

960
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,352
But things will change soon.

961
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,636
We'll raise hell
and make a name for ourselves.

962
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,275
Girl.

963
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,550
You there! Come over here.

964
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,878
I see you here sometimes.
What's your name?

965
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,070
I am Omatsu.

966
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:54,039
- Your age?
- Guess.

967
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:57,673
Between 18 and 20?

968
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,430
Just about.

969
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,553
Where is your home?

970
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,114
To the west.

971
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,278
- Where in the west?
- A pilgrims' amulet office.

972
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:11,078
What? An amulet office?

973
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:14,078
YOu!

974
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,513
You're one of the new girls at Kizuya?

975
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,113
When is your official announcement?
I'll help you out when you -

976
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,600
No.

977
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:29,155
I, Serizawa, Shinsen Group leader,
will make you a woman.

978
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,473
All right?

979
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,832
You may go.

980
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:48,676
I must talk to Yoshida a while.

981
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,153
I'm leaving. Take over.

982
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,640
Leaded.

983
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,271
It's about Yoshida.

984
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,150
He still lives outside
and not at Mibu.

985
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:03,314
He's a bad example for the other men.

986
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,474
In a way, he's a member,
yet not a member.

987
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,640
He's not the type
to be bound to a group.

988
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,677
Leave him to me.

989
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:28,280
I want to speak to you
in another room.

990
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:49,029
You see, I don't know his face.

991
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,077
I do.

992
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:54,153
Before you carry out
your important task,

993
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,558
there's something I must say.

994
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,073
It's about Omatsu.

995
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,392
The poor girl has no parents.

996
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:08,031
She had a grandfather,
but the poor man was killed.

997
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,160
What?

998
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,313
I'll explain in full later.

999
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:17,311
It may sound funny for me to say it,

1000
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,273
but she's a very nice girl.

1001
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:24,509
When you're done here,
will you take her with you?

1002
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:28,560
I mean, will you marry her?

1003
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,669
It's too soon for talk like that.
I've got important work.

1004
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,071
I know you'll win.

1005
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,911
Shichibei's behind you.

1006
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,440
Don't look so stern.

1007
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,796
I travel about
peddling expensive stuff.

1008
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,475
I meet thieves at night
or in the mountains.

1009
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,711
That's why I carry it.

1010
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:03,030
If things go wrong for you, it's bang!

1011
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,915
That's cowardly. I'll fight fairly.

1012
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,360
Please don't worry.

1013
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,636
I won't need it.

1014
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:18,479
You, Omatsu, and I
are avenging your brother.

1015
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,159
We can't lose.

1016
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,071
Kill Kondo?

1017
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:46,354
As I said, that former farmer
and I differ in everything.

1018
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,833
It makes it hard to lead the group.

1019
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,596
With Kondo gone,
Hijikata will follow me.

1020
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,717
The sooner the better.

1021
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,673
No, as soon as possible.

1022
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,518
Are we doing it tonight?

1023
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,598
After this party.

1024
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,037
No, he'll leave early

1025
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:19,518
and go to see Oume,
his mistress, at Karasumaru.

1026
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:23,598
We don't want to attract attention,

1027
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,037
so we three will go at a suitable time.

1028
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:31,639
No, there'll be one more.
Heisuke Todo.

1029
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,317
We four will be enough.

1030
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,277
What about that nuisance Yoshida?

1031
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,119
Yoshida,

1032
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:49,759
if you succeed,
there will be a generous reward.

1033
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:55,394
I'll give you Hyoma's head.

1034
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:02,920
The brother of Bunnojo Utsugi,
the man you killed at Mount Mitake.

1035
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:09,713
He's been inquiring all over Mibu
as to your whereabouts.

1036
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,917
Our men will kill him.

1037
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,149
Reward number two is
Kondo's woman.

1038
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:25,433
Her name is Miyuki.
She's a courtesan at Kizuya.

1039
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,918
She's quite beautiful.

1040
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,434
You must be lonely
all by yourself in Kyoto.

1041
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,839
Did you hear us, Omatsu?

1042
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,959
No, I felt sick, so I was resting here.

1043
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,793
I must return to the party.

1044
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,149
No, you don't.

1045
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,793
Se rizawa.

1046
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,555
What are you doing?

1047
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,313
What?

1048
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,994
She was eavesdropping.
I'm questioning her.

1049
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:01,272
No need for that. Just kill her.

1050
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,712
She's not worth the bother.

1051
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,956
Then leave her to me.

1052
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,189
You go back to the men.

1053
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,600
I agree to what you said.

1054
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,199
I see.

1055
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,633
In that case -

1056
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,754
Woman.

1057
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,639
Who told you to come here?

1058
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:44,831
No one.

1059
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:50,199
The party was so noisy.
I came here for some quiet.

1060
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,631
Please forgive me!

1061
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,670
I didn't hear what you were saying.

1062
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,834
Shout or run

1063
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,191
and I'm afraid I'll have to kill you.

1064
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:07,473
Stay as you are until I leave.

1065
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,873
What is it?

1066
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,755
Behind you.

1067
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:02,072
Behind me?

1068
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,679
The figure of a woman.

1069
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,432
A woman?

1070
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,631
I felt something too
and looked back,

1071
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,913
but I saw nothing.

1072
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:22,398
But I'm sure I saw her.

1073
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,720
It's a ghost!

1074
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,955
A ghost?

1075
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,630
Long ago,
a courtesan named Kokonoe -

1076
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:33,515
I don't know the reason -

1077
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,795
She put on her makeup
and dressed in her best

1078
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:40,909
and then stabbed herself
here with a dagger.

1079
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:44,513
This room hasn't been used since.

1080
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:52,437
A likely enough story,
but there are no ghosts.

1081
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,670
I'm more afraid of the living
than the dead.

1082
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:36,754
Did you see it again?

1083
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:39,514
Yes.

1084
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,909
I didn't see anything...

1085
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,833
but I distinctly heard sounds.

1086
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,354
Sounds?

1087
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,677
Mountain winds.

1088
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:59,478
They rise up from deep in the valleys...

1089
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:05,154
blowing up the young green leaves.

1090
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,591
Beyond, all you see

1091
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,555
are endless mountain ranges...

1092
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:21,393
that fade far away into the clouds.

1093
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:26,560
I saw such a scene once somewhere.

1094
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,509
At Daibosatsu Pass, I think.

1095
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:34,594
Daibosatsu Pass?

1096
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:40,232
Do you know that pass, samurai?

1097
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,233
Very well.

1098
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,114
But how do you know it?

1099
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,236
I passed there once.

1100
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,830
A difficult climb,
15 miles up and down.

1101
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,277
Very strange.

1102
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:04,918
Why would a Kyoto girl
climb a mountain pass?

1103
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:11,791
It was as a pilgrim two years ago in May,
with my grandfather.

1104
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,549
<i>Ryunosuke, please kill me here!</i>

1105
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,119
<i>Fool!</i>

1106
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:06,677
<i>The sword is the soul!
Study the soul to know the sword.</i>

1107
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,276
<i>Evil mind, evil sword!</i>

1108
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,795
<i>Merciful Buddha...</i>

1109
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,720
<i>Fool!</i>

1110
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:40,994
Se rizawa!

1111
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:46,793
I promise to kill Kondo!

1112
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,119
Se rizawa!

1113
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,592
Serizawa! Where's Kondo?

1114
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,638
Se rizawa!

1115
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:31,914
Kill him!

1116
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,280
Finish him off!

1117
