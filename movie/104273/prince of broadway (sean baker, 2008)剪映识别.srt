taggle

1575
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,900
the defendant is a flight risk

1576
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,733
he's not even a us citizen and to take his passport

1577
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:17,333
wouldn't be enough to secure honor

1578
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:18,366
this is ridiculous

1579
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:21,100
my client is not a flight risk he's a newlywed

1580
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,966
he's got an apartment in Queens

1581
01:25:23,133 --> 01:25:26,133
he's a simple salesman he is not a counterfeiter in fact

1582
01:25:26,133 --> 01:25:28,733
we haven't even established whether these goods are counterfeit

1583
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:30,133
or not incidentally

1584
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,066
we are considering a civil rights action against the city

1585
01:25:33,066 --> 01:25:34,333
if this goes to trial

1586
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,200
Mr Krikorian what's your background

1587
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:41,766
i'm an Armenian from Lebanon

1588
01:25:41,766 --> 01:25:43,200
he's being unfairly targeted

1589
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,100
his court is not

1590
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,733
in the business of dismissing cases to protect the city

1591
01:25:46,733 --> 01:25:47,600
from lawsuit now

1592
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,100

i'm gonna set bail at one hundred thousand dollars your honor

1596
01:26:00,066 --> 01:26:02,000
that's totally insufficient to protect the right

1597
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,133
to the trademark owners

1598
01:26:03,133 --> 01:26:03,666

that's enough

1601
01:26:04,766 --> 01:26:07,266
gentlemen take it up with federal court

1602
01:26:07,266 --> 01:26:09,600
