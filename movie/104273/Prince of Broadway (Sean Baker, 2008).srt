i'm not interrogating you i'm fucking arresting you

1520
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,900
how many pieces like

1521
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:05,766
four fifty bags like two something sneakers beggaming taggle

1522
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,900
the defendant is a flight risk

1523
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,200
he's not even a us citizen

1524
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,333
and to take his passport wouldn't be enough to secure honor

1525
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:18,366
this is ridiculous

1526
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:20,000
my client is not a flight risk

1527
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,966
he's a newlywed he's got an apartment in Queens

1528
01:25:23,133 --> 01:25:26,133
he's a simple salesman he is not a counterfeiter in fact

1529
01:25:26,133 --> 01:25:28,733
we haven't even established whether these goods are counterfeit

1530
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:30,133
or not incidentally

1531
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,066
we are considering a civil rights action against the city

1532
01:25:33,066 --> 01:25:34,333
if this goes to trial

1533
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,200
Mr Krikorian what's your background

1534
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:41,766
i'm an Armenian from Lebanon

1535
01:25:41,766 --> 01:25:43,200
he's being unfairly targeted

1536
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,100
his court is not

1537
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,733
in the business of dismissing cases to protect the city

1538
01:25:46,733 --> 01:25:47,600
from a lawsuit now

1539
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,133
come on Roger

1540
01:25:48,133 --> 01:25:49,100
you got something on your mind

1541
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,500
don't make me guess it give me a number

1542
01:25:50,566 --> 01:25:52,333
one hundred thousand dollars your honor

1543
01:25:57,066 --> 01:26:00,066
i'm gonna set bail at one hundred thousand dollars your honor

1544
01:26:00,066 --> 01:26:02,000
that's totally insufficient to protect the right

1545
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,133
to the trademark owners

1546
01:26:03,133 --> 01:26:03,666
and all right

1547
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:04,266
that's enough

1548
01:26:04,266 --> 01:26:04,766
that's enough

1549
01:26:04,766 --> 01:26:07,266
gentlemen take it up with federal court

1550
01:26:07,266 --> 01:26:09,600
if you wish our jurisdiction is penal law

1551
01:26:09,733 --> 01:26:12,100
not trademark law have a nice day thank you

1552
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:12,900
