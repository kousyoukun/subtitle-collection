949
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,423

Now, since we're dealing
with an unpredictable target,

961
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,465
navigation is gonna be crucial.

962
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,970
Our navigator, Carl Saunders,
is gonna be making sure we hit the mark,

will run real-time calculations

964
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,017

965

And once we clear the atmosphere,
we'll begin the refueling process.

971
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,158
we'll use our thrusters
to position ourselves

972
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,660
over the Mare Crisium.

973
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,371
Our Chinese friends
have jerry-rigged the on board systems

974
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,457
so that we can fly it without electronics.

975
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,794
So we'll park the rover section
of the module with the bomb inside,

976
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,880
then switch the electronics back on

977
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,259
and use it as bait
to lure this thing out of its hole.

978
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,470
Then, you guys will pull the trigger

979

and kill it.
