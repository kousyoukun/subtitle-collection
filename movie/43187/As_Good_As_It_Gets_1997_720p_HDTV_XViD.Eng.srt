1
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:30,354
I'm going to get some flowers, dear.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

2
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:34,222
It's tulip season today,
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:40,632
Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,567
Yes, come on now, sweetheart.

5
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:59,029
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

6
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:01,872
Go for a ride.

7
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:04,435
Come on, sweetie.

8
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:09,905
Freeze!
Leg down, leg down.

9
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,907
That's it.
Come on now.

10
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:19,986
No, you monkey-eared
son of a bitch!

11
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,988
You have pissed your last floor.

12
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:27,930
Bet you wish
you were a real dog.

13
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,767
Oh, you dog-eared monkey.

14
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,794
This is New York.

15
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:38,388
If you can make it here,
you can make it anywhere...

16
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,468
you ugly, smelly...

17
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,292
- Verdell!
- Uh-oh.

18
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,568
Where's my good doggie?
Verdell?

19
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:00,315
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,771
- Mr. Udall?
- Mm-hmm?

21
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:07,925
Have you seen Verdell?

22
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,669
What does he look like?

23
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:17,397
My dog. You know, my...

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,641
My dog with the little,
adorable face.

25
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,295
Don't you know
what my dog looks like?

26
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,952
Oh, I got it.
You were talking about your dog.

27
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:29,117
I thought it was the name
of that colored man I see in the hall.

28
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,053
Which color was that?

29
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,966
Like thick molasses...

30
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,136
- with a broad nose...
- Frank!

31
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:40,662
perfect for smelling
trouble and prison food.

32
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:45,499
- Simon, you've got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs, Melvin Udall.

33
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:46,843
How are you doin'?

34
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,497
Frank shows my work,
Mr. Udall.

35
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,672
- I think you know that.
- People are gonna start coming.

36
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:55,933
What I know is that as long as you
keep your work zipped up around me...

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,934
I don't give a rat crap
what or where you shove your show.

38
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:01,756
Are we done
being neighbors for now?

39
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,601
- Let me talk to you...
- No! Not worth it.

40
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,672
Definitely not worth it.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

41
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:14,463
Okay.

42
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:19,093
Hope you find him.
Love that dog.

43
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:23,352
You don't love anything,
Mr. Udall.

44
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,954
One, two, three, four, five.

45
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,951
One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,970
Okay.

47
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:15,325
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

48
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,772
- Hi, Carl.
- Frank, where is he?

49
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:37,818
- Isn't he here? He lives here.
- Take it easy.

50
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:40,609
- He had a little thing with the dog.
- It's not such a hot-looking dog.

51
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:41,985
He's adorable.

52
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,736
Who buys more than me?
He isn't the only one working.

53
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,219
Good Lord.
Where have you been?

54
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:53,026
Oh, look at my boy.

55
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,678
Look at him.

56
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:01,694
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

57
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,736
Where was my little baby?

58
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:08,580
In the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

59
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:16,416
- Go ahead,John. You earned your fun.
- Sorry. It just struck me.

60
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:19,007
- It's funny.
- Oh, wait.

61
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,786
How did he get down
in the basement...

62
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,709
even if he got
in the elevator?

63
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:29,920
Maybe some nice neighbor
shoved him down the garbage chute?

64
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:32,295
Somewhere in the dark...

65
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:34,334
Somewhere in the dark...

66
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:38,018
she had confessed,
and he had forgiven.

67
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,869
"This is what you live for,"
he said.

68
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:44,645
"Two heads on a pillow,
where all is approval...

69
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,653
and there is only the safety...

70
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:49,694
of being with each other."

71
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:53,029
How, she wondered,
could she find such hope...

72
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:55,038
in the most shameful part of her?

73
00:05:56,552 --> 00:06:00,610
At last she was able
to define love.

74
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
Love was...

75
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,981
Mr. Udall, I'd like
to speak to you, please.

76
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:08,577
Let me do this by myself.

77
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:11,681
- Love was...
- Are you in there?

78
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:13,029
Son of a bitch!

79
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,165
Pansy-ass stool pusher.

80
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,891
Yes?

81
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,763
Maybe this can wait.

82
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,735
I found Verdell.

83
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:34,056
Well, that's a load off.

84
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:38,083
Uh-huh.
Did you do something to him?

85
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:40,871
Do you realize
that I work at home?

86
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,842
I wasn't aware.

87
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:48,900
Do you like to be interrupted when
you're nancing around in your garden?

88
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,795
No. I actually...

89
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:56,680
will turn the ringer off on my phone
and put cardboard...

90
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:59,495
Well, I work all the time...

91
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:03,621
so never, never interrupt me,
okay?

92
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:06,211
Not if there's a fire.

93
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:08,455
Not even if you hear the sound
of a thud from my home...

94
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:10,944
and one week later there's
a smell coming from there...

95
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,736
that can only be
a decaying human body...

96
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,658
and you have to hold a hanky
to your face...

97
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:18,822
because the stench is so thick
you think you're gonna faint.

98
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:22,023
Even then,
don't come knocking.

99
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:25,223
Or if it's election night...

100
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,878
and you're excited
and you want to celebrate...

101
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,922
because some fudge packer
you date...

102
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:33,291
has been elected the first queer
president of the United States...

103
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:35,844
and he's going to have you...

104
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,469
down to Camp David...

105
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,540
and you want someone
to share the moment with.

106
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:44,002
Even then...

107
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:45,768
don't knock...

108
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:47,942
not on this door...

109
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:51,144
not for any reason.

110
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:54,179
Do you get me, sweetheart?

111
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,023
Yes.

112
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:02,021
It's not a subtle point
that you're making.

113
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:05,068
Okay then.

114
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:21,352
So the theory of confrontations says:
"Think twice before messing with me."

115
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,813
All right.

116
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,430
Love was...

117
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,678
What was love?

118
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,814
Love was...

119
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:49,701
Now I am pissed.
Now I am really pissed!

120
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,735
Don't touch! Don't touch!

121
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:56,808
Shut up! You think you can intimidate
the whole world with your attitude.

122
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,141
You don't intimidate me.
I grew up in hell, homeboy.

123
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,379
My grandmother had more attitude.

124
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:05,864
Police!
Donut-munching morons.

125
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:09,003
Help me!

126
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:10,796
Shut up!

127
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:13,254
Assault and battery,
and you're black!

128
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:17,672
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable...

129
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:21,061
if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

130
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,374
Meantime...

131
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,758
I'm gonna think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

132
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,492
I hate doing this!

133
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,896
I'm an art dealer.

134
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:39,375
Have a nice day.
Okay, party!

135
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,617
- Excuse me.
- Whoa. Don't touch.

136
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,177
Get a life.

137
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,241
- Watch it.
- Don't touch.

138
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:17,706
- Look at you. You're all better.
- It's that new medication.

139
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,325
You know all my son's stuff, right?
No, no. I got a date tonight.

140
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,785
I'm walking out and he says,
"Mom, I promise not to get...

141
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:26,097
one of my fevers or coughs
during your date."

142
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:29,131
- Isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

143
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:33,488
It came out of me: "You love me
the way you love your remote control.

144
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:36,110
As long as I switch every time
you press one of my buttons."

145
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:38,035
That's terrific.

146
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:41,035
People that talk in metaphors
oughta shampoo my crotch.

147
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,258
- Eat up.
- Stay there. I've got your money.

148
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,397
- No, pay me next week.
- I owe you.

149
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,323
I told you today.
That's the rule.

150
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,331
- Excuse me, Melvin.
- Don't...

151
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:58,382
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

152
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,580
Pardon me.

153
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:06,092
Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

154
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,427
This way you take a cab home
so you can get ready for the date.

155
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:12,177
Ready is not my problem.

156
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,588
I'm starving.

157
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:16,819
Go on. Sit down. You know
you're not allowed back here.

158
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,577
Spence is more excited than I am.

159
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:22,324
He says, "I promise not to get
a fever or cough during your date."

160
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,871
Sometimes this kid,
you just want to...

161
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,593
I've gotJews at my table.

162
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:31,150
It's not your table.
It's the place's table. Behave.

163
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,197
This once you can sit
at someone else's station.

164
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:36,976
Or you can wait your turn.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,301
- You have feelings for her?
- Well, yes.

166
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:47,190
How much more you got to eat?

167
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,057
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

168
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:57,299
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

169
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:00,435
- Let me talk to him.
- I don't care how many books he sells.

170
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:03,821
- Give him one more chance. Here I go.
- Barred for life.

171
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:16,911
- They left.
- Yeah. What do you know?

172
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,672
Bryan says he doesn't care
how long you've been coming.

173
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:26,007
You ever act like this again,
you're barred for life.

174
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:29,041
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

175
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,661
Three eggs over easy...

176
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,999
two sausage,
six strips of bacon with fries.

177
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:36,888
Fries today.

178
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:40,947
A short stack,
coffee with cream and sweetener.

179
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,026
You're gonna die soon
with that diet.

180
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,546
We're all gonna die soon.
I will, you will.

181
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:48,626
It sure sounds like
your son will.

182
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,304
If you ever mention my son again...

183
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,121
you will never be able
to eat here again, understand?

184
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:23,546
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

185
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:29,844
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

186
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:36,340
Do you?

187
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,709
Yes.

188
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,948
- Yeah?
- Yes.

189
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:54,261
I'll get your order.

190
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,547
Wear my earrings tonight.

191
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,459
It's just so interesting
what you said at dinner.

192
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:07,770
You said it
like it was nothing.

193
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,486
Where's the bedroom?

194
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,024
This is sort of it.
I sort of sleep in here.

195
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,870
Don't worry about it.

196
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,607
What?

197
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,871
I don't know.

198
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,117
Grandma.

199
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:13,560
Maybe you'd better check.

200
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,488
What did you think
I was gonna do?

201
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:21,274
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mama!

202
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:24,160
I was hearing everything
that you were doing...

203
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:27,487
so I put these on
to give you privacy.

204
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:31,067
- So how was dinner?
- Hey, pal.

205
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,796
- How's your friend?
- Are you okay?

206
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,713
- Not bad.
- You got a temperature?

207
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:37,785
Scootch over.

208
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:41,752
- Where did your friend take you to eat?
- A nice place.

209
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,157
I have him.

210
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,440
- One more spit?
- I said I have him. He's waiting.

211
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:52,060
- Go.
- She has me.

212
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,367
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

213
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:57,696
- Give me a big hug.
- Carol, I have him.

214
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:00,665
I'm okay, Mom.
She has me. Go.

215
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:07,043
Close the curtains.

216
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:14,531
No, you can't smoke!
He can't take smoke!

217
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,522
- Magic.
- Oh.

218
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:30,110
Oh, God.
Well, that'll teach you.

219
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:32,963
I don't even notice it anymore.

220
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,582
All right. Come here.

221
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,612
You don't have to get that embarrassed.
It's a little bit of throw up.

222
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,750
Little bit of throw up.

223
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:55,642
Well, what shall we do?

224
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:58,751
Want me to write which trains you take
to get home, or you wanna lay down...

225
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:01,539
No, no.
I'll take a cab.

226
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,300
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

227
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,683
I just can't. I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

228
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:23,549
Carl, take me off the speaker,
Did I tell you these are house seats?

229
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:25,892
you could use a break,

230
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,415
Hello, Carl?

231
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:30,342
you there?

232
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,402
Okay. I just found a model.

233
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,973
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy. He bought me dinner.

234
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,894
Carl, right?

235
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,792
Hey, what's going on?

236
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:50,686
- Remember?
- I only need one.

237
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:54,340
You picked me up maybe a few weeks,
I don't know, some time ago.

238
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:56,514
This is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

239
00:17:57,673 --> 00:17:59,331
Portrait?

240
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:03,078
I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

241
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,730
Brad Pitt. It's the shit.

242
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,295
- I don't get it.
- Do you read?

243
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,544
Who is it, baby?

244
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:19,176
Who is that, Verdell?

245
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,410
I'm sorry.
I told you today.

246
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,613
I was in the studio doing work,
and I just...

247
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,713
It's out here.

248
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:35,016
- Sure have great things.
- Gershwin is great, isn't he?

249
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,188
I usually make a big deal
about picking models...

250
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,168
but Carl is so thorough.

251
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,926
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your resume, huh?

252
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:47,937
This is not a nude.

253
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:53,477
just kidding around.

254
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,718
So much for love.

255
00:18:57,324 --> 00:18:58,665
Yet another pose.

256
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:01,579
Exactly what is
your previous experience?

257
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:05,768
How about that, hmm?
I'm running out of ideas here.

258
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,859
Then give me some direction.

259
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,720
Nothing.

260
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:14,919
I just watch until something
strikes me.

261
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,857
I mean, do anything
that you think of.

262
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:22,123
Wait for me to say "hold that pose,"
then try to comfortably hold it.

263
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,211
No direction.

264
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:29,771
Okay.

265
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:33,066
What I do is watch.

266
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:37,165
You ever watch somebody
who doesn't know you're watching them?

267
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,328
An old woman
sitting on a bus...

268
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,437
or kids going to school...

269
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,363
or somebody just waiting.

270
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,910
And you see this flash
come over them...

271
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:51,943
and you know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything external...

272
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:53,443
because that hasn't changed.

273
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:56,235
And when you see it,
they're sort of realer...

274
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:58,374
and they're more alive.

275
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:02,693
If you look at somebody long enough,
you discover their humanity.

276
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,541
Wow.

277
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,921
I know exactly what you mean.

278
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:18,245
Oh, my God.
Hold it.

279
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,162
- Hey, look out!
- Excuse me.

280
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,054
- Sorry.
- I got on the third line of dialogue,

281
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,244
I blanked. I had no clue
as to what the next line was.

282
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:38,541
- Ignores me.
- He said to me, "Last chance."

283
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,550
- Last chance.
- Oh, God.

284
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:41,965
I came back in.

285
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,820
Here she comes
to ignore me again.

286
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,572
I messed up
on the exact same line.

287
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:49,062
- Guess what.
- What?

288
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:50,991
He cast me!

289
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:53,326
just what the world needs...
another actress.

290
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:55,400
Okay, okay.

291
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,975
Can't live without me, huh?

292
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:08,685
I'm finally gonna ask.

293
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:12,648
What's with the plastic
picnic ware?

294
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:14,827
Why don't you try ours?
You're afraid it isn't clean?

295
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,127
- You okay?
- I see the help. It's a judgment call.

296
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:21,521
So give yourself
a little pep talk.

297
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,976
Must try other people's
clean silverware...

298
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,440
as part of fun
of dining out.

299
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,831
What's wrong with your son?

300
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,287
Yeah. What do you care?

301
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:45,263
He's got to fight to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

302
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,990
He's allergic to dust.

303
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:50,506
This is New York, so his immune system
bails on him whenever there's trouble.

304
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,929
So an ear infection...
Is this bothering you?

305
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,645
An ear infection, whatever, sends us to
the emergency room six times a month...

306
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:05,938
where I get whatever nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

307
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:07,979
Nice chatting with you.

308
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:12,210
- His name?
- Spencer.

309
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,180
Okay.

310
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,340
Spence.

311
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:24,469
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

312
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:28,363
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

313
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:40,717
You can put on anything you want now.
I might be sort of done here.

314
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,692
For two weeks all we've done is work.
Let's play!

315
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:48,212
Vincent!

316
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,818
So you're practically finished, huh?

317
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,949
Yeah.
There is one more stage.

318
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:12,528
Where you going?

319
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,574
No place.
I was just gonna sneak a peek.

320
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:29,933
- You want some chocolate?
- No, he's not allowed.

321
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,211
Wait.

322
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,411
I gotta take off.
You want to say good-bye or anything?

323
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:38,961
- He's just gotta go. One second.
- No, wait.

324
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:42,261
I'm gonna look
at the painting.

325
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,479
Where are you going, sweetheart?

326
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,519
You want some water?
What is the matter with you?

327
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:55,698
You want some water?

328
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:01,491
Simon, wait!

329
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,740
Why are you doing this?

330
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:19,186
No. No, wait.

331
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,687
See.

332
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,901
- That painting in there...
- What, are you cruising him?

333
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:34,546
Excuse me.

334
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:37,336
- Help me!
- We gotta go.

335
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:41,108
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

336
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:55,899
So you call 9-1 -1
and don't leave your name?

337
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:57,174
That's right.

338
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,798
Even a dumb geezer should know
Emergency automatically...

339
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,941
- No one got killed.
- Oh, is he dead?

340
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:03,386
Ask him.

341
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:04,762
What's wrong with you?

342
00:25:04,828 --> 00:25:07,511
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name ya.

343
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:12,469
We will. If we can't, we'll come back
and ask you again and again.

344
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:15,508
What, you're trying to
intimidate me with that attitude?

345
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:19,258
I come from hell. My grandmother's
got more attitude than you.

346
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:22,839
Go shake down a 7-Eleven
for a day-old wiener.

347
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,292
It's just a matter of time, sir.
There's a painting of one of the guys.

348
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:28,219
Get some tape on it.

349
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:32,796
I've been praying for him
since I heard.

350
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:35,065
So, anyway, I'm on my way
to the hospital.

351
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,621
If you could just
watch the dog tonight.

352
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,483
- I'm sorry. No.
- Okay. Thanks.

353
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,437
Old bitch.

354
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,357
Damn dog.

355
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:53,945
You're taking him.
Yes, you are!

356
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:56,186
Get the hell out of the way!

357
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:59,321
You're taking him.
This will even the books. One night.

358
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,396
Wait, wait.

359
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:06,107
Do you want to say no to me?

360
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:07,549
Huh?

361
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:13,246
I don't want to say nothing
to you.

362
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:18,140
Because I've never felt as crazy
as I do right now.

363
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:20,280
I almost want you to say no.

364
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:26,553
Thanks for looking after him.

365
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,342
Hey! Where are you going?

366
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:33,337
- You can't do this.
- You don't wanna mess with me today!

367
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:37,182
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's ever been in here before.

368
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:41,722
Hey, Frank.

369
00:27:28,611 --> 00:27:29,658
You're dead.

370
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,490
We don't have no dog food here.
We don't want no dog food here.

371
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:38,205
You'll eat what we got,
what we eat.

372
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:43,202
All right.

373
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:49,921
Don't do anything.

374
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:07,011
Where's the trust?

375
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:18,524
Never a break.

376
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,703
Dogs.

377
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:33,251
Always look at the bright side
of your life

378
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,187
Always look at the lighter side
of your life

379
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:52,291
God.

380
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:52,487
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

381
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:55,204
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

382
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:57,310
and we haven't sold
a single painting.

383
00:28:57,383 --> 00:28:59,357
We can't reduce the price
at this stage.

384
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:01,919
What...
I'm in a free fall here.

385
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,715
- Yes?
- We can see him.

386
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,565
Okay. I'll meet you in there.

387
00:29:06,632 --> 00:29:09,021
I will meet you in there.

388
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,949
Okay? One minute.

389
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,796
Thank you.
No, I'm here.

390
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:17,954
How are you doing, great one?

391
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:20,163
I haven't looked at myself yet.

392
00:29:20,232 --> 00:29:22,435
I figured I could tell
from your reaction.

393
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:24,227
Oh, God.

394
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:27,236
That bad, huh?

395
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:30,593
I talked to the doctor,
and... Oh!

396
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,520
Okay. It's not that bad.

397
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:38,789
The doctors say you're gonna be
your old self in a couple of weeks.

398
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,383
The scars might take...

399
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,945
Oh, shit!

400
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,359
-Jackie.
- Yes?

401
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:53,440
Can you hand me a mirror,
please?

402
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:04,455
Wait.
I have a smaller one.

403
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,368
So how are things anyway?

404
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,003
How's Verdell?

405
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:22,409
Your neighbor, Mr. Udall.

406
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:24,482
Taking care of him.

407
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:26,791
How could you do that?

408
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,746
- No, Simon.
- He'll hurt him.

409
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:31,529
I promise. Not a chance.

410
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,313
I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

411
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:36,167
I'm always on the move.

412
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,274
Trust me.

413
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:42,948
You are very certain my dog is okay,
because you have no idea...

414
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,929
Your dog is fine, Simon.

415
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:48,522
Okay.

416
00:30:51,437 --> 00:30:53,291
Waiting gives the devil time.

417
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,363
Oh, my.

418
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,524
Where did I go?

419
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:27,817
- Look how friendly he is.
- That's your dog?

420
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:33,610
What are you doing
with a dog?

421
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:36,427
Suckered in, set up,
pushed around.

422
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,341
You're not worried
someone might take it?

423
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:44,389
No, not until now,
for Christ's sake.

424
00:31:44,462 --> 00:31:46,796
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna sit here.

425
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:49,957
Hey, puppy.

426
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:52,038
He's cute.

427
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,958
I love his little face.
It's so cute.

428
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:56,549
I wonder what breed he is.

429
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,533
He's a little dog.

430
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Next time, if Bryan's not here,
you can bring him in.

431
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:11,177
How old are you?

432
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:13,669
If I guessed by your eyes,
I'd say you were 50.

433
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,999
If I went by your eyes,
I'd say you were kind.

434
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:20,814
So much for eyes.
How old are you?

435
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:22,571
You brought it up.

436
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,194
- No, I'm curious.
- Not that you're ugly.

437
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:28,526
Yeah. Easy, pal.
I can take the compliment.

438
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:32,138
But my knees knock when you
turn on the charm full blast.

439
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:36,712
But I mean,
what's with the dark?

440
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,162
Dawn patrol.

441
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:45,031
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

442
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:49,295
This time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

443
00:32:49,362 --> 00:32:51,980
- So I get him home...
- No, no!

444
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:57,354
The dog.
The bacon's for the dog.

445
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:03,087
Last week I was playing the piano
for him, and he likes it.

446
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:06,928
So I decided I'm gonna...

447
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,304
make a joke.

448
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:09,832
So you're all set here.

449
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,280
Yeah.

450
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,877
I think it's a beautiful day
for our walk today.

451
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,801
Very nice.

452
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:37,037
Look at that. Look at him.

453
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,798
I gotta give you something.

454
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:42,250
I gotta give you something
real good too.

455
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:46,121
I'm gonna show it to you.
Come on, buddy.

456
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:50,130
Don't you be like me.

457
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:53,099
You stay just the way you are,
because you are a perfect man...

458
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:55,856
and I'm gonna take you home
and get you something to eat.

459
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:59,951
- What you love. Hear me?
- I'd like to be treated like that.

460
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:04,177
I'm gonna take you home right now
and get you something. Yes.

461
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,317
Let's go home
and do some writing.

462
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:09,515
He had made the girl happy...

463
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,622
and what a girl.

464
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:15,443
"You saved my life," she said.

465
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,989
"You'd better make it up to me."

466
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,500
Done.

467
00:34:25,974 --> 00:34:29,040
Yes, I hate the doggie.

468
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,444
Ooh, 62 books.

469
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,615
Done.

470
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:33,814
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

471
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:36,204
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

472
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:39,378
- He has no medical insurance?
- No.

473
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:43,920
These are the food receipts here,
the household expenses.

474
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:45,845
Here's one for the dog again.

475
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:48,398
- I can read it. I got it.
- There you go.

476
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:51,220
- All the laundry and cleaners.
- Okay, good.

477
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:55,277
Boy, look at that, huh?

478
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:59,280
Oh, he likes it
at Chez Melvin, hmm?

479
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:03,697
What are you coming over here for?
I told you to sit here.

480
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,990
I can't cook with a dog near me.
Okay,just sit. Good.

481
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:10,925
We don't want any company.
I'll read you some Ralph Waldo Emerson.

482
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,854
Okay, have it your way.

483
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,206
How's Verdell doing?

484
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:28,562
You know,
he's a pain in the ass.

485
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:31,223
Well.

486
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:33,329
Simon's home.

487
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:37,012
I was hoping you can keep the dog
until he's had a chance...

488
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:38,608
to think and adjust.

489
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:42,609
Oh, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

490
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,721
No, he definitely
wants him back right away.

491
00:35:45,818 --> 00:35:47,672
He'll be by tomorrow.

492
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:51,410
Okay.

493
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,336
Okay by me.

494
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,844
Hungry.
I'll be right with you, pooch.

495
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,420
One, two, three, four, five.

496
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:19,862
I'm okay.

497
00:37:03,326 --> 00:37:05,180
Mr. Udall.

498
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:14,712
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

499
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:16,887
Could you take it...

500
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,347
just...

501
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,811
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

502
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,672
Thank you.

503
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:35,767
Come here, my beautiful boy.

504
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,781
Come here, boy.

505
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,927
Let's go home and get well.

506
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,189
You can't blame him
for being weird.

507
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:48,308
Have a look at yourself
in the mirror.

508
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,885
Thank you.

509
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,461
Come on, sweetheart.

510
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:03,261
Come here, boy.

511
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:07,776
I know what you want.

512
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,663
Where's my boy?

513
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:21,503
Don't force him.

514
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:54,433
Over a dog.

515
00:38:57,763 --> 00:38:59,934
Over an ugly dog.

516
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:10,367
Worst sidewalk in New York.

517
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:12,289
Look where they put it.

518
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,545
Help!

519
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:23,907
If you want to see me,
you will make an appointment.

520
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:27,745
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder...

521
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:30,659
and then act as though I had
some choice about barging in?

522
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:32,862
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.

523
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:36,706
You said you could help me.
What was that, a tease?

524
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:39,554
I can help you
if you take responsibility...

525
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:42,010
- to keep regular appointments.
- You changed the room around.

526
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:44,867
Two years ago.
I also regrew my beard.

527
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:47,420
But you're not interested
in changes in me.

528
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:51,355
I don't have this mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

529
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:54,778
Do you know how hard it was
for me to come here?

530
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:56,892
- Yes.
- Thank you.

531
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,747
No, we're not doing this now.

532
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:04,548
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

533
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,495
What if this is
as good as it gets?

534
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,856
What the heck are those for?

535
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:39,102
No. Get Carol.

536
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,833
I'm filling in.

537
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,758
We don't know
if she's coming back.

538
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:45,693
She might be getting a job
closer to home.

539
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,726
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

540
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,461
What the heck do you mean?

541
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:56,030
Look, elephant girl...

542
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:59,006
just go get Carol or something.

543
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,633
just have her do
my one meal here.

544
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,875
I'll pay whatever you want.
I'll wait.

545
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:08,833
Do it!

546
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:14,242
- Bryan, code blue.
- What happened?

547
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,661
Out!
just shut up and get out!

548
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:24,932
Do it!

549
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:27,237
I'll be quiet.

550
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:29,640
just let me stay here.

551
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:32,161
No problem.
Go get Carol.

552
00:41:33,673 --> 00:41:35,233
Get her here.

553
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:38,983
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

554
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,122
I'm a great customer.

555
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:42,339
This day...

556
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,064
has been a disaster.

557
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:50,184
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out.

558
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,553
Get out immediately...

559
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,920
or there's gonna be trouble.

560
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:56,841
Man, I mean it.

561
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:06,951
Okay.

562
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,514
See ya. Good-bye.

563
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,230
It's about time!

564
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:19,882
Carol's last name.

565
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,358
- Connelly.
- Thank you.

566
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:27,937
Hey, Dad, I'm over here!

567
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:34,085
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not anymore.

568
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:35,399
What can you do?

569
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,540
Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?

570
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:47,685
Why not? You're a good girl.

571
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:49,131
Hello.

572
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:05,221
Christ.

573
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:24,838
I'm hungry.

574
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:29,324
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

575
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:30,951
What are you doing here?

576
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:33,957
This is not a sexist thing.
If you were a waiter...

577
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:36,814
Are you totally gone?
This is my private home.

578
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:42,410
I'm trying to keep emotion
out of this...

579
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:44,868
even though it's
an important issue to me...

580
00:43:44,944 --> 00:43:48,108
and I have very strong feelings
on the subject.

581
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:49,866
What subject?

582
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:52,521
That I wasn't there to take crap
from you and bring you eggs?

583
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:55,690
Do you have any control over how
creepy you allow yourself to get?

584
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:04,267
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

585
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:07,591
And to prove it...

586
00:44:07,665 --> 00:44:10,152
I have not gotten personal,
and you have.

587
00:44:11,921 --> 00:44:14,026
Why aren't you at work?

588
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:15,624
You sick?

589
00:44:18,194 --> 00:44:20,048
You don't look sick.

590
00:44:21,905 --> 00:44:23,759
just tired and bitter.

591
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:29,384
My son is sick, okay?

592
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:34,760
What about your mother?

593
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:37,447
How do you know
about my mother?

594
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:41,192
I hear you talking
while I wait.

595
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:44,584
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One second.

596
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,146
How're you doing?

597
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:04,168
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

598
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,472
Melvin, that's it. I cannot handle
you teaching my son manners!

599
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,394
Back to life.

600
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,857
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

601
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:26,707
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand...

602
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:29,805
three one-thousand,
two one-thousand...

603
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:31,251
bingo.

604
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:36,586
- 1 04.9.
- Let's treat ourselves to a cab ride.

605
00:45:38,165 --> 00:45:40,750
Look out, you guys.
Coming through.

606
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:46,892
- Mom!
- We're okay.

607
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:51,213
Melvin, wait!

608
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:53,613
Melvin, wait!

609
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,713
Shut up, kids!

610
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,844
Give us a lift,
would you, Melvin?

611
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,764
A lift. Okay.

612
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:13,068
Cover your mouth
when you cough, kid.

613
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:18,188
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
and quickly, please.

614
00:46:18,263 --> 00:46:19,953
Okay.

615
00:46:20,022 --> 00:46:21,647
- Hospital?
- Yes.

616
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:24,980
- Could you be back at work today?
- No!

617
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:27,468
Stay away from me!
God!

618
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:30,999
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

619
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:34,446
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

620
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,007
I feel terrible that I have to...

621
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,836
- Simon.
- Huh?

622
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:41,937
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

623
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:45,070
Sorry.

624
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:51,408
- What are those cards?
- Frank's idea.

625
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,389
He thought I should have notes
so I did this right...

626
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:57,686
maintained focus, didn't get emotional
and tried not to terrify you.

627
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:02,896
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

628
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:10,261
Simon, you're broke.

629
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:15,574
The medical bills
are $61 ,000 now...

630
00:47:15,642 --> 00:47:17,464
and the show didn't go well.

631
00:47:17,529 --> 00:47:19,732
I've spoken to your parents.

632
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:22,354
They didn't hang up
or anything...

633
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:25,621
but they said they would
feel strange about calling you.

634
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,781
Well, I can't call them.

635
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:30,897
Come here, baby.

636
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:36,888
Verdell. What's wrong?

637
00:47:37,946 --> 00:47:42,321
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am, sweetheart!

638
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:44,565
Happy to see me,
you little pissant mop?

639
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:47,384
How about another ride
down the chute?

640
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,840
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

641
00:47:49,915 --> 00:47:51,922
- Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

642
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,718
Sorry. I'm sorry.

643
00:47:55,803 --> 00:47:58,585
I'll be able to keep
my apartment and the studio...

644
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,505
won't I?

645
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:06,105
Wow.

646
00:48:06,172 --> 00:48:08,211
Oh, my God.

647
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:39,385
Yes, you write more than everybody else
and make us a lot of money.

648
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:41,307
- But it's more appropriate...
- Look.

649
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:45,495
I need this.
just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

650
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:47,159
Okay?

651
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:53,683
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you. That's good.

652
00:48:53,758 --> 00:48:58,646
On a pleasanter note, my son
just got accepted to Brown.

653
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:00,790
My husband was dying.

654
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:04,211
Yeah. Good, nice,
thrilled, exciting.

655
00:49:04,287 --> 00:49:06,676
You don't have to wait with me.

656
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:14,908
I can't resist.

657
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:17,146
You usually move
through here so quickly.

658
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:20,411
I have so many questions
I want to ask you.

659
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:23,926
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

660
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:25,821
What does it mean to you?

661
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:32,030
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

662
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:35,576
Oh, God.
This is like a nightmare.

663
00:49:35,648 --> 00:49:40,121
just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

664
00:49:43,232 --> 00:49:45,304
How do you write women so well?

665
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:47,514
I think of a man...

666
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:50,367
and I take away reason
and accountability.

667
00:50:05,345 --> 00:50:08,443
- Where's my newspaper?
- It's right here, Mrs. Garrett.

668
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,471
"M.D."

669
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:22,072
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

670
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:24,764
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

671
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:26,972
What? Please,just tell me.

672
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,295
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.
- Not your name!

673
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,711
- Don't tell me your name! Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

674
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:37,339
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

675
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:40,193
- Did you know docs come to your house?
- No, I didn't.

676
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:42,909
- I'm home!
- So what are you doing here?

677
00:50:42,979 --> 00:50:45,881
-I didn't know you had a secret admirer.
-What?

678
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:48,988
- Oh, you met the gift.
- He's good.

679
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:53,499
- I'm an expert on doctors.
- Okay, Doctor.

680
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:58,266
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

681
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:00,957
She said I was to take excellent care
of this little guy...

682
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:03,646
because you are urgently needed
back at work.

683
00:51:03,716 --> 00:51:05,723
What kind of work do you do?

684
00:51:06,788 --> 00:51:09,308
- I'm a waitress.
- In Manhattan.

685
00:51:11,844 --> 00:51:14,713
Uh, yeah, Terry. Excuse me.

686
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:18,563
I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

687
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:21,116
I couldn't find it either.
Could you get this to the lab?

688
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:24,320
Tell them I need CBC, differential,
platelets, the whole thing.

689
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:26,625
- And I want it back today.
- Okay.

690
00:51:26,693 --> 00:51:29,507
I'm sorry. Did you say you're gonna
get the results back today?

691
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:31,427
Sure. Let's sit down.

692
00:51:33,253 --> 00:51:36,635
These are the receipts
from all the prescriptions...

693
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:38,880
from the beginning of the year.

694
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:43,292
- The calendar.
- And this is a calendar of days...

695
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:45,918
and how he felt
and what he's been eating.

696
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:49,405
That's very good.
How long has he had the problem?

697
00:51:49,478 --> 00:51:52,063
Since forever. Six months old.

698
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:54,851
- Have they done blood tests on him?
- Yeah.

699
00:51:54,919 --> 00:51:57,122
Only in the emergency room
or when he was well?

700
00:51:57,191 --> 00:52:00,965
- Emergency room only.
- How about skin testing for allergies?

701
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:04,195
- No.
- No standard scratch test?

702
00:52:04,263 --> 00:52:09,216
No. I asked. They said my plan
didn't cover it and it wasn't necessary.

703
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:11,742
- Why? Should they have?
- Well...

704
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:15,076
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

705
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:20,446
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, that's their technical name.

706
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,803
So, once the tests come back...

707
00:52:24,872 --> 00:52:27,719
is there someone in your office
we should talk to to get the results?

708
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:31,777
Um, me. My home number's on the card.

709
00:52:33,223 --> 00:52:35,077
That's his home number.

710
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:44,392
- What?
- It's your home number!

711
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:52,287
Can we get you anything else?
Do you want some water or some coffee?

712
00:52:52,361 --> 00:52:55,361
- No, thank you.
- A couple of female slaves?

713
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:59,938
Mrs. Connelly, there's still
a lot of tests I need to do...

714
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,983
a lot of things
I have to find out here.

715
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:05,766
But look, whatever I find out,
I promise you, at the very least...

716
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:09,826
from now on your son is going to feel
a great deal better, okay?

717
00:53:17,898 --> 00:53:18,945
Doc!

718
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:26,473
No. Oh, fine. Okay.

719
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:28,064
That's good.

720
00:53:33,803 --> 00:53:36,770
So, listen, you gotta let me know
about the additional costs.

721
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:38,085
One way or another, we'll...

722
00:53:38,154 --> 00:53:40,455
Well, the costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

723
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:45,602
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

724
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:51,946
That's wonderful!

725
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,042
Anyway, dear.
Thank you for everything, Nora.

726
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:03,589
Forgive my recent crankiness.
I'll call when things get back on track.

727
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:13,163
Huh? What's wrong?

728
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:16,610
- Who's gonna walk Verdell?
- Oh, no!

729
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,547
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

730
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:43,523
Would there be any way
that you would be willing...

731
00:54:43,598 --> 00:54:45,605
to walk his dog for him?

732
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:47,172
Absolutely.

733
00:54:48,462 --> 00:54:50,600
You're a wonderful man.

734
00:54:53,614 --> 00:54:56,843
2:00 would be a good time,
and here is the key...

735
00:54:56,911 --> 00:54:58,885
in case he is asleep.

736
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,964
Open his curtains for him...

737
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,161
so he can see God's beautiful work.

738
00:55:05,231 --> 00:55:09,289
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

739
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:14,693
Did they teach you to talk like this
in some "Sailor, wanna hump-hump" bar?

740
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:17,614
Or is this getaway day
and your last shot at his whiskey?

741
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,160
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

742
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,749
A seriously goofy man is behind this.
You're not allowed to block that out.

743
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:38,061
Do you really want to go
back to Emergency...

744
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:41,095
where those runt doctors
keep telling us that they can't help?

745
00:55:41,169 --> 00:55:44,235
- This lets a crazy man into our lives.
- Let's not fight.

746
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:46,192
You know how this will turn out.
Come on!

747
00:55:49,297 --> 00:55:51,980
You know how this will turn out.

748
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:54,699
This is not like stockings.
It's not like a string of pearls.

749
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:57,070
You don't send this one back.

750
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:02,442
Right?

751
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:11,692
No, I do, I understand,

752
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:14,150
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

753
00:56:18,802 --> 00:56:20,176
Bye-bye.

754
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:29,295
What a day. Come here.

755
00:56:29,363 --> 00:56:32,177
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

756
00:56:32,243 --> 00:56:34,664
Thank you for walking him.

757
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:39,344
If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling so well.

758
00:56:39,411 --> 00:56:42,280
This place smells like shit.

759
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:43,729
Go away.

760
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:48,428
- This cleaning lady doesn't...
- Please,just leave!

761
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:53,676
What happened to your queer
party friends?

762
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:55,242
Get outta here!

763
00:57:01,268 --> 00:57:04,268
Nothing worse than having to feel
this way in front of you.

764
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,689
Nellie, you're a disgrace
to depression.

765
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,001
Rot in hell, Melvin.

766
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:15,922
No need to stop being a lady.

767
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:17,450
Quit worrying.

768
00:57:17,525 --> 00:57:20,427
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

769
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:30,291
Is this fun for you?

770
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:36,010
You lucky devil. It just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

771
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,606
I'm losing my apartment.

772
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:44,013
And Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

773
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,973
And I won't.

774
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:49,268
I don't want to paint anymore.

775
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:52,749
So the life that I was trying for
is over.

776
00:57:52,822 --> 00:57:54,894
The life that I had is gone...

777
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:59,025
and I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself
that it's difficult to breathe.

778
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:01,550
It's high times for you, isn't it?

779
00:58:01,623 --> 00:58:05,136
The gay neighbor is terrified.

780
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:06,450
Terrified!

781
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:21,009
I was just trying to give you a boost.

782
00:58:22,392 --> 00:58:24,246
Lucky you.

783
00:58:24,312 --> 00:58:26,962
You're here for rock bottom...

784
00:58:27,032 --> 00:58:30,806
you absolute horror of a human being.

785
00:58:43,513 --> 00:58:47,571
The one thing I'll do for you...
I might cheer you up.

786
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:50,030
Get out.

787
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:53,454
You wanna know
why the dog prefers me?

788
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:56,398
It's not affection.
It's a trick.

789
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,193
I keep bacon in my pocket.

790
00:59:03,257 --> 00:59:04,150
See?

791
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:07,255
Oh, my gosh.

792
00:59:11,258 --> 00:59:14,072
We'll both call him.
You'll see.

793
00:59:14,138 --> 00:59:15,512
It's a trick.

794
00:59:24,571 --> 00:59:25,945
Come here, Verdell.

795
00:59:32,508 --> 00:59:33,937
Come on.

796
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:38,487
Come here, baby. It's okay.

797
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,231
just stupid. A stupid dog.

798
00:59:48,764 --> 00:59:50,138
Could you leave now?

799
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:53,210
Please?

800
00:59:54,748 --> 00:59:56,602
I don't get it.

801
01:00:48,831 --> 01:00:50,260
Taxi!

802
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,996
Watch again with Nick At Nite's
Classic TVRewind,

803
01:01:24,064 --> 01:01:26,617
On repeat viewing,
one begins to suspect...

804
01:01:26,688 --> 01:01:30,616
that might not really be Major Healy
in the phone booth after all,

805
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:36,670
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

806
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:49,772
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

807
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,413
If you're, uh...

808
01:02:01,907 --> 01:02:05,006
If you're worried about thanking me...

809
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:07,752
That's not why I'm here.

810
01:02:07,796 --> 01:02:12,204
Though you have no idea what it's like
to have a real conversation...

811
01:02:12,276 --> 01:02:13,869
with a doctor about Spencer.

812
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:18,861
Note. Put it in a note.

813
01:02:30,071 --> 01:02:31,500
I have a hair dryer...

814
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:34,741
Why did you do this for me?

815
01:02:37,784 --> 01:02:40,053
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

816
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,342
Do you have some idea
how strange that sounds?

817
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:45,783
Well, I mean...

818
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:48,664
I'm worried you did this be...

819
01:03:03,996 --> 01:03:06,996
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

820
01:03:10,973 --> 01:03:12,347
Look.

821
01:03:15,037 --> 01:03:16,892
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

822
01:03:16,957 --> 01:03:20,340
I don't think this can wait.
I need to clear this up now.

823
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:22,581
Clear what up?

824
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:27,931
I'm not going to sleep with you.

825
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,748
I will never sleep with you!
Never, ever!

826
01:03:32,256 --> 01:03:33,947
Not ever!

827
01:03:40,865 --> 01:03:42,720
I'm sorry, but...

828
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:48,061
we don't open for the "no sex" oaths
until 9:00 a.m.

829
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:51,329
I'm not kidding.

830
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:54,368
Anything else?

831
01:03:57,955 --> 01:03:59,449
just...

832
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:03,586
thank you.

833
01:04:07,652 --> 01:04:09,507
So you'll be at work tomorrow?

834
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,357
Yes.

835
01:04:29,768 --> 01:04:31,742
"Never," she says.

836
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:53,482
I took a chance you were up.

837
01:04:54,828 --> 01:04:57,064
I brought you some Chinese soup.

838
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:01,635
Thanks.

839
01:05:17,871 --> 01:05:20,522
I've never been this tired
in my life.

840
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:29,903
I haven't been sleeping.

841
01:05:32,657 --> 01:05:35,145
I haven't been clear in my head...

842
01:05:35,217 --> 01:05:37,388
or felt like myself.

843
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:41,320
I'm in trouble.

844
01:05:43,154 --> 01:05:46,056
It's not just the tiredness.

845
01:05:46,131 --> 01:05:49,709
- Boy.
- Sick. Nauseous.

846
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,666
Sleepy.

847
01:05:51,732 --> 01:05:53,804
Where everything looks distorted...

848
01:05:53,876 --> 01:05:55,916
and everything inside you...

849
01:05:55,988 --> 01:06:00,178
kind of aches and you can barely find
the will to complain.

850
01:06:00,244 --> 01:06:01,935
Yeah.

851
01:06:05,493 --> 01:06:08,275
I'm glad we did this.

852
01:06:09,622 --> 01:06:11,629
Good talking to you.

853
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:22,293
You are not still writing
that thank-you note.

854
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,848
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

855
01:06:26,297 --> 01:06:29,745
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

856
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:33,232
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

857
01:06:35,001 --> 01:06:37,390
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

858
01:06:37,466 --> 01:06:40,433
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

859
01:06:40,506 --> 01:06:43,735
You better start finding something else
to do with your free time.

860
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:47,411
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yes.

861
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:49,817
All right. We got pizza.

862
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:52,917
Carol and I are going out.
Sausage and pepperoni.

863
01:06:52,988 --> 01:06:55,126
You want to make this later
for you and Spencer?

864
01:06:56,797 --> 01:06:59,666
We are going out, like people do.

865
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:05,272
If you can't feel good
about this break...

866
01:07:05,342 --> 01:07:08,375
and step out a little...

867
01:07:08,447 --> 01:07:11,130
then I think you
ought to have Mr. Udall...

868
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:13,271
send you over a psychiatrist.

869
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:17,085
I don't need one, because I know
what's really going on here!

870
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:21,783
I gotta finish this letter
or I'll go nuts.

871
01:07:21,856 --> 01:07:24,344
This can't be right.
"Con-science?"

872
01:07:31,905 --> 01:07:32,952
What?

873
01:07:49,188 --> 01:07:52,800
It's very weird now
not feeling that...

874
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:55,651
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

875
01:07:57,701 --> 01:08:00,734
Without that, I just
start thinking about myself.

876
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:03,620
And what good does that
ever get anybody?

877
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:10,750
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple...

878
01:08:10,823 --> 01:08:12,710
and I felt myself...

879
01:08:14,664 --> 01:08:15,940
giving them a dirty look.

880
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:23,047
I just had no idea everything was...

881
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:32,961
Go ahead.

882
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:37,930
Moving in the wrong direction.

883
01:08:38,956 --> 01:08:41,028
Away from a time...

884
01:08:41,099 --> 01:08:44,896
when I remembered what it was like
to have a man to anything.

885
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:47,590
Hold fucking...

886
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,725
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

887
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:53,993
Hands with, for Christ's sake!

888
01:08:57,005 --> 01:09:00,649
I felt almost really bad...

889
01:09:00,718 --> 01:09:02,212
that Dr. Bettes is married.

890
01:09:06,255 --> 01:09:10,030
Which is probably why I make Spencer
hug me more than he wants to.

891
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,895
Poor kid doesn't have enough problems.

892
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,775
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

893
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:23,696
Who needs these thoughts?

894
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,528
So what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

895
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:30,122
Leave me be!
Why are you doing this?

896
01:09:30,195 --> 01:09:32,584
What is it you want?

897
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,698
I hope getting me to think about
everything that's wrong...

898
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:36,658
when all I want to do
is not do that...

899
01:09:36,723 --> 01:09:38,578
has some purpose.

900
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,435
Really, Mom, what is it you want?
What?

901
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,736
I want us to go out.

902
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,945
Okay.

903
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:17,838
Thank you.

904
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,052
Now I gotta send you
a thank-you note.

905
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,625
Oh, look. Evelyn's here
and her giant,Joey.

906
01:10:27,835 --> 01:10:27,962
That's really
why you brought me here?

907
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:30,166
That's really
why you brought me here?

908
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:32,853
Well, you know,
it's not even mine.

909
01:10:32,923 --> 01:10:35,858
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

910
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:39,893
But the dog did throw up
twice last night and his spark is off.

911
01:10:39,965 --> 01:10:42,780
- Well, take him to the vet.
- I did.

912
01:10:42,845 --> 01:10:46,904
They say his stomach's out of whack
and they need him for a couple of days.

913
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:48,467
Well, do it!

914
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,183
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

915
01:10:53,502 --> 01:10:56,371
- This is for later.
- What's this?

916
01:10:57,599 --> 01:10:59,988
- It's a note.
- A note?

917
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,681
Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

918
01:11:02,752 --> 01:11:04,792
Thank-you note? No, no.

919
01:11:04,864 --> 01:11:07,285
- You can read it later.
- No, thank you.

920
01:11:07,361 --> 01:11:09,019
No thank-you note.

921
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:13,820
Thank you.

922
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:21,465
She's nice.

923
01:11:23,298 --> 01:11:25,240
- Yeah.
- Real nice, huh?

924
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,169
Really nice.

925
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:34,042
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
telling somebody, "No thanks required"?

926
01:11:35,396 --> 01:11:37,981
Sure looks like it went over too.

927
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:42,532
Look at you!

928
01:11:44,773 --> 01:11:48,253
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

929
01:11:53,414 --> 01:11:55,301
- What?
- Look at you.

930
01:11:55,367 --> 01:11:58,913
- You think I'm a mark.
- You helped with the dog and now this.

931
01:11:58,983 --> 01:12:01,732
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

932
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,767
- Concerned?
- It's not just financial assistance.

933
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,840
He's gotta get to Baltimore
to ask his parents for money tomorrow.

934
01:12:07,912 --> 01:12:11,425
Well, yeah. I mean,
if his parents are alive.

935
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:13,385
They have to help.
It's the rules.

936
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:16,417
That's great.
Let them help him.

937
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,838
Only, uh...

938
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:25,063
I got a high-maintenance selling painter
coming through, so I'm out.

939
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:27,466
Can you drive him?

940
01:12:29,644 --> 01:12:31,651
Think white and get serious.

941
01:12:33,421 --> 01:12:34,915
Take my car. A convertible.

942
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:38,727
Do you drive?

943
01:12:38,797 --> 01:12:41,732
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

944
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:44,195
Gettin' loud.

945
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,488
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

946
01:12:48,559 --> 01:12:51,144
I want your life for one minute,
where my big problem is...

947
01:12:51,215 --> 01:12:54,663
somebody offers me a free convertible
so I can get out of this city.

948
01:13:01,713 --> 01:13:05,226
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay, I'll do it.

949
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,857
I'll take him.

950
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,904
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

951
01:13:08,977 --> 01:13:11,366
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

952
01:13:11,442 --> 01:13:14,093
- Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

953
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,672
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

954
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:21,073
We don't enjoy one another that much.

955
01:13:26,196 --> 01:13:29,011
If there is a mental health foundation
that raises money for people like you...

956
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:31,050
please be sure to let me know.

957
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:33,777
Last-word freak.

958
01:13:33,845 --> 01:13:37,325
- Good luck, lady.
- Was he talking to me?

959
01:13:37,398 --> 01:13:40,660
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

960
01:13:42,774 --> 01:13:45,491
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

961
01:13:50,776 --> 01:13:53,645
What I did for you,
it's working out?

962
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:00,048
What you did changed my life.

963
01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:07,216
No thank-you note.

964
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:10,519
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life...

965
01:14:10,586 --> 01:14:12,473
which you won't read...

966
01:14:13,915 --> 01:14:15,955
is that somehow
you have done more...

967
01:14:16,027 --> 01:14:18,231
for my mother, my son...

968
01:14:18,299 --> 01:14:21,495
and me than anybody else ever has.

969
01:14:21,564 --> 01:14:24,597
I'm just gonna read you
this part of it.

970
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:29,365
"And that makes you
the most important, surprising...

971
01:14:29,437 --> 01:14:31,477
generous person
I ever met in my life...

972
01:14:31,549 --> 01:14:34,331
and that you're gonna be
in our prayers...

973
01:14:34,398 --> 01:14:36,253
our daily prayers forever."

974
01:14:37,662 --> 01:14:38,709
Lovely.

975
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:43,737
I also wrote one part
I'm just gonna say.

976
01:14:43,807 --> 01:14:45,301
I wrote, "I'm sorry."

977
01:14:47,295 --> 01:14:52,216
I was talking about I was sorry
when I got mad at you for...

978
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:55,420
when you came over and you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

979
01:14:55,488 --> 01:14:58,303
So I wrote that I was sorry
about that and that I...

980
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:02,526
I was sorry for busting you on that
and busting in on you that night...

981
01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:03,968
when I said I was never...

982
01:15:06,691 --> 01:15:09,757
I was sorry, and I'm sorry
for every time your food was cold...

983
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:12,642
and that you had to wait two seconds
for a coffee filler...

984
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:15,554
and I'm sorry for never spotting right
there at the table in the restaurant...

985
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:19,515
the human being that had it in him
to do this thing for us.

986
01:15:20,997 --> 01:15:23,102
You know what?
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

987
01:15:23,173 --> 01:15:25,442
"I have not been able...

988
01:15:25,509 --> 01:15:27,964
to express my gratefulness to you.

989
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:29,946
Even as I look
at the word 'grateful' now...

990
01:15:30,022 --> 01:15:31,964
it doesn't begin to tell you
what I feel."

991
01:15:36,134 --> 01:15:40,771
That's nice of you.
Thank you.

992
01:15:42,855 --> 01:15:44,229
Thank you.

993
01:15:54,505 --> 01:15:56,479
Now I want you to do something for me.

994
01:16:04,714 --> 01:16:07,202
I'm sorry.
Didn't I say, "What?"

995
01:16:07,275 --> 01:16:09,763
I thought I said "What?"

996
01:16:12,459 --> 01:16:13,506
What?

997
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,849
I want you to go on this trip.

998
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,828
No, sir.

999
01:16:17,901 --> 01:16:19,810
I can't do this without you.

1000
01:16:19,884 --> 01:16:23,910
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff"one eye" on me.

1001
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:25,574
I need you to chaperone.

1002
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:28,034
Separate everything but cars.

1003
01:16:28,109 --> 01:16:30,564
You said you like convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook.

1004
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:33,027
I'm sorry. The stiff"one eye"?

1005
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:35,045
- Two days.
- I can't. I work.

1006
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:37,508
- You get off when you want to.
- My son.

1007
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:39,176
Bettes said he's doin' fine.

1008
01:16:40,816 --> 01:16:43,336
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What's that got to do with it?

1009
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:47,369
- I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note, ain't she sweet.

1010
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:49,743
I need a hand,
and where did she go?

1011
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:52,558
Are you saying accepting your help
obligates me?

1012
01:16:54,418 --> 01:16:56,360
Is there any other way to see it?

1013
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:09,197
Here's a little suitcase...

1014
01:17:09,268 --> 01:17:12,017
shocked that it's being used.

1015
01:17:20,565 --> 01:17:23,248
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

1016
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:49,783
- You're still comin', aren't you?
- yes,

1017
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,010
I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

1018
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:59,130
just south of Baltimore, Maryland,
and I know what you're gonna say next.

1019
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:02,326
I mean, I think I know,

1020
01:18:02,396 --> 01:18:04,632
I'm not sure...

1021
01:18:04,699 --> 01:18:07,219
but I think so,

1022
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:09,496
There's no need for me to bring
anything dressy?

1023
01:18:11,516 --> 01:18:12,890
I didn't know...

1024
01:18:12,957 --> 01:18:15,378
if we were eating in any restaurants
that have dress codes.

1025
01:18:16,861 --> 01:18:20,177
Well, I don't...

1026
01:18:20,253 --> 01:18:22,293
I mean, maybe,

1027
01:18:22,366 --> 01:18:24,537
I mean, yes! Let's.

1028
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,350
Gotcha.

1029
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,229
- What did you think I was gonna ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

1030
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:38,231
Okay, then. Good night.

1031
01:18:42,817 --> 01:18:45,632
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1032
01:18:48,002 --> 01:18:50,206
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

1033
01:18:50,274 --> 01:18:53,373
Put him in with that one, not that one.
Builds his confidence.

1034
01:18:54,787 --> 01:18:56,161
Lip kiss.

1035
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:02,264
I love you.
I'll miss you.

1036
01:19:02,339 --> 01:19:05,339
Hey! Real sensitive!

1037
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:09,019
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

1038
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:19,484
Don't worry, Mom!
Have a good time!

1039
01:19:19,558 --> 01:19:22,143
- Don't run.
- Have fun! Don't worry!

1040
01:19:22,214 --> 01:19:26,371
- Have fun, but don't run.
- Grandma will take care of me! Bye!

1041
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,916
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you myself.
- So am I, Frank.

1042
01:19:33,992 --> 01:19:35,847
Give me a hug.

1043
01:19:37,737 --> 01:19:40,355
- Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

1044
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:41,952
Soak it up.

1045
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:46,014
It's your last chance for a hug
for a few days.

1046
01:20:00,748 --> 01:20:02,603
Thank you for being on time.

1047
01:20:07,565 --> 01:20:09,703
Carol the waitress.
Simon the fag.

1048
01:20:13,102 --> 01:20:15,753
Hello.
Holy God! Who did that to you?

1049
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,127
Um, I was attacked.

1050
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:23,533
I walked in on some men robbing me...

1051
01:20:23,599 --> 01:20:26,468
and I was hospitalized.

1052
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:31,563
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

1053
01:20:31,632 --> 01:20:33,487
Let's go.

1054
01:20:35,601 --> 01:20:37,673
How are you, sir?
Oh, I was gonna do that for you.

1055
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:39,785
It's all right.
Where should we sit?

1056
01:20:39,858 --> 01:20:42,989
I, uh... Well, there's
no place cards or anything.

1057
01:20:43,058 --> 01:20:47,313
You look like you need more room,
so I'll sit in the back.

1058
01:21:01,652 --> 01:21:04,848
Never a break. Never.

1059
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:07,732
Thank you for the seat.
That was very thoughtful.

1060
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:12,273
- You look like you're crowded in there.
- It's all right.

1061
01:21:15,063 --> 01:21:16,437
Thanks.

1062
01:21:25,144 --> 01:21:26,932
Thank you.

1063
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,295
You're welcome.

1064
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:37,008
I've got the whole trip programmed.

1065
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:44,721
I'm just kidding.
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1066
01:21:46,363 --> 01:21:48,435
Seriously.

1067
01:21:48,507 --> 01:21:51,060
We got good stuff here.

1068
01:22:00,925 --> 01:22:05,976
When it's not always raining
There'll be days like this

1069
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,664
- When there's no complaining
- I like this music.

1070
01:22:08,734 --> 01:22:10,806
There'll be days like this

1071
01:22:10,878 --> 01:22:13,333
I like this music.

1072
01:22:13,406 --> 01:22:15,991
Like the flick of a switch

1073
01:22:16,063 --> 01:22:18,484
Well, my mama told me

1074
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:21,723
There'll be days like this

1075
01:22:21,793 --> 01:22:27,161
Well, I'm looking for my girl
I wonder where can she be

1076
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:31,227
Simon, I'm sure they did something
really off for you to feel this way...

1077
01:22:31,297 --> 01:22:34,559
but when it comes to your parents
or your kid...

1078
01:22:34,626 --> 01:22:38,849
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

1079
01:22:38,915 --> 01:22:43,487
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

1080
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:46,370
Nonsense.
And you want to know why?

1081
01:22:46,436 --> 01:22:49,251
Anybody here who's interested in what
Melvin has to say, raise their hand.

1082
01:22:58,533 --> 01:23:01,282
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?

1083
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:03,008
Yes.

1084
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:05,730
- When I was a kid...
- No, wait.

1085
01:23:05,799 --> 01:23:08,548
I'm gonna pull over,
give you my full attention.

1086
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:16,993
Well, I always painted,
and my mother always encouraged it.

1087
01:23:17,064 --> 01:23:21,025
I mean, she was really
sort of fabulous about it, actually.

1088
01:23:21,097 --> 01:23:24,064
And she used to...

1089
01:23:24,137 --> 01:23:27,617
I was too young to think
that there was anything wrong with it.

1090
01:23:27,689 --> 01:23:32,708
She was very natural,
so she used to pose nude for me.

1091
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:36,740
And I always thought,
or I guess I assumed...

1092
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:38,785
that my father knew about it.

1093
01:23:38,859 --> 01:23:40,615
This stuff is pointless.

1094
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:44,131
- Hey, let him finish...
- You like sad stories? Wanna hear mine?

1095
01:23:44,204 --> 01:23:45,316
Stop.

1096
01:23:48,364 --> 01:23:51,942
Go ahead, really.
Please don't let him stop you.

1097
01:23:53,805 --> 01:23:59,239
One day he walked in and found us,
and he started screaming.

1098
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:01,961
My father didn't come out of his room
for 1 1 years.

1099
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:04,932
He used to hit me on the hands
with a yardstick if I made a mistake...

1100
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:06,795
playing the piano.

1101
01:24:10,768 --> 01:24:12,142
Go ahead, Simon.

1102
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:15,591
So you said he came in your room
and he was yelling?

1103
01:24:15,664 --> 01:24:18,184
- Uh-huh.
- Please, come on.

1104
01:24:20,241 --> 01:24:23,088
- He was, um...
- Come on.

1105
01:24:23,153 --> 01:24:25,902
Yeah, I know. I was...

1106
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:28,304
I remember I was defending
my mother...

1107
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:30,890
and I was trying to, you know...

1108
01:24:30,962 --> 01:24:34,028
make peace in the lamest way.

1109
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:36,520
I said...

1110
01:24:36,595 --> 01:24:38,984
"She's not naked. It's art."

1111
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,501
He started hitting me...

1112
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:48,656
and he beat me unconscious.

1113
01:24:48,725 --> 01:24:51,889
And he talked to me
less and less after that.

1114
01:24:51,957 --> 01:24:54,990
I mean, he knew what I was
before I did.

1115
01:24:55,061 --> 01:24:58,476
And the morning
that I left for college...

1116
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,405
he walked into my room...

1117
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,317
and he held out his hand...

1118
01:25:03,383 --> 01:25:06,034
and it was filled with money.

1119
01:25:07,224 --> 01:25:11,414
A big, sweaty wad of money.

1120
01:25:13,337 --> 01:25:17,014
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

1121
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:22,386
And I just grabbed him
and I hugged him...

1122
01:25:22,457 --> 01:25:24,945
and he turned and walked out.

1123
01:25:36,763 --> 01:25:39,959
We all have these terrible stories
to get over, and you...

1124
01:25:40,029 --> 01:25:41,490
That's not true.

1125
01:25:41,564 --> 01:25:44,247
Some of us have great stories,
pretty stories...

1126
01:25:44,317 --> 01:25:46,357
that take place at lakes...

1127
01:25:46,429 --> 01:25:50,171
with boats and friends
and noodle salad.

1128
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:52,093
just no one in this car.

1129
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:53,718
But a lot of people...

1130
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:57,500
that's their story:
good times, noodle salad.

1131
01:25:57,567 --> 01:26:01,429
What makes it so hard
is not that you had it bad...

1132
01:26:01,504 --> 01:26:05,050
but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

1133
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,244
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1134
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,094
Not it at all, huh?

1135
01:26:15,906 --> 01:26:19,550
Let's go to the hotel.

1136
01:26:19,618 --> 01:26:22,171
Tomorrow you'll see if you can get
another big wad...

1137
01:26:22,242 --> 01:26:24,413
of sweaty money out of his hand.

1138
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,801
Can I ask you a personal question?

1139
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,154
Sure.

1140
01:26:41,509 --> 01:26:43,364
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

1141
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:50,234
I mean, wouldn't your life
be easier if you weren't...

1142
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:52,317
You consider your life easy?

1143
01:26:54,278 --> 01:26:57,093
All right.
I give you that one.

1144
01:27:00,647 --> 01:27:02,021
Nice packin'.

1145
01:27:11,529 --> 01:27:13,601
- Hey, Spence.
- Hi, Mom,

1146
01:27:14,378 --> 01:27:17,029
- Wait till you hear,
- Why are you out of breath?

1147
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:20,033
Mom, I ran over a guy
and scored a goal,

1148
01:27:20,106 --> 01:27:23,935
- You did?
- yeah, He was big, Charlie, you know,

1149
01:27:24,011 --> 01:27:26,280
That's great!

1150
01:27:26,348 --> 01:27:29,195
- yep, Amazing,
- Oh, my God, right?

1151
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,845
Mom, we're playing again,
Gotta go, Bye,

1152
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:33,891
Wait.Just tell me...

1153
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:39,691
- He scored a goal,
- Mom, I don't believe it.

1154
01:27:39,757 --> 01:27:41,829
- Oh, you would've died.
- Oh, my God,!

1155
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:48,332
My son was outside playing soccer.
Come on.

1156
01:27:48,398 --> 01:27:51,431
Take me out for a good time.
Take me out dancing.

1157
01:27:51,503 --> 01:27:52,583
Dancing?

1158
01:27:53,647 --> 01:27:56,167
I can't. I'm exhausted.

1159
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,956
Oh, come on. Please, come on.

1160
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,789
All right.

1161
01:28:02,864 --> 01:28:04,936
You're right.

1162
01:28:05,009 --> 01:28:09,744
- Are you sad or something?
- No, I'm nervous.

1163
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:13,520
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

1164
01:28:13,586 --> 01:28:15,277
What a nice compliment.

1165
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,132
I'm happy.

1166
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,714
And you're my date.

1167
01:28:34,389 --> 01:28:35,850
Let's get dressed.

1168
01:28:44,758 --> 01:28:47,092
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Okay.

1169
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:49,548
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1170
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:28,600
- All set?
- Yeah.

1171
01:29:32,509 --> 01:29:34,964
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1172
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,720
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1173
01:29:46,271 --> 01:29:48,856
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1174
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:52,085
Thank you.

1175
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,753
Good evening.

1176
01:29:53,824 --> 01:29:56,857
- Hi. You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1177
01:29:56,929 --> 01:30:00,125
just him. Okay, you can answer.
We worked it out.

1178
01:30:00,193 --> 01:30:01,622
Yes, we do.

1179
01:30:01,665 --> 01:30:04,567
Oh, and I can give you
a tie and jacket.

1180
01:30:04,642 --> 01:30:07,489
- What?
- They require a tie and jacket.

1181
01:30:07,555 --> 01:30:08,929
We have some available.

1182
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,195
No, I'm not putting that on.

1183
01:30:25,156 --> 01:30:29,117
I'm also not going to let you inject me
with the plague, either.

1184
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:31,393
It's such a nice place.

1185
01:30:31,462 --> 01:30:33,851
You probably have these dry cleaned
all the time, don't you?

1186
01:30:33,926 --> 01:30:35,682
Actually, I don't think so.

1187
01:30:43,463 --> 01:30:47,292
Well, you just wait here.

1188
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,054
Excuse me.

1189
01:31:01,546 --> 01:31:03,401
Good evening.

1190
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:08,128
- I need a coat and tie.
- Well, come on in.

1191
01:31:12,043 --> 01:31:15,076
- Uh, that one.
- This one?

1192
01:31:15,148 --> 01:31:17,766
That one, yeah.
And this tie.

1193
01:31:26,734 --> 01:31:28,327
Excuse me.

1194
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:35,852
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

1195
01:31:35,919 --> 01:31:39,432
- Thanks.
- Should I get her for you?

1196
01:31:39,503 --> 01:31:42,602
No, that's all right.
I'll just watch.

1197
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,822
- Can I buy you another drink?
- This is plenty. No, thank you.

1198
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:35,411
Oh. Wait.

1199
01:33:05,084 --> 01:33:07,539
You look so se...

1200
01:33:09,468 --> 01:33:11,857
You look, uh, great.

1201
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:15,569
You look great.

1202
01:33:25,599 --> 01:33:27,028
You want to dance?

1203
01:33:28,607 --> 01:33:31,771
Well, I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1204
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:33,813
- And?
- No.

1205
01:33:36,032 --> 01:33:38,421
I don't get this place.

1206
01:33:39,649 --> 01:33:43,195
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

1207
01:33:44,129 --> 01:33:45,722
I don't get it.

1208
01:33:46,753 --> 01:33:49,174
What? No. Wait. Why?

1209
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,185
Where are you goin'? Why?

1210
01:33:55,107 --> 01:33:58,653
I didn't mean it that way.
You ought to sit down.

1211
01:33:58,723 --> 01:34:01,789
You can still give me the dirty look.
just sit down and give it to me.

1212
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:03,997
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1213
01:34:04,067 --> 01:34:07,034
I need one. Quick.

1214
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:10,403
You have no idea how much
what you just said hurt my feelings.

1215
01:34:10,469 --> 01:34:13,665
The mono-minute someone gets
that they need you...

1216
01:34:13,733 --> 01:34:15,805
they threaten to walk out.

1217
01:34:15,878 --> 01:34:18,845
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1218
01:34:20,422 --> 01:34:24,000
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1219
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,214
And mean it.

1220
01:34:45,578 --> 01:34:46,952
Can we order first?

1221
01:34:54,539 --> 01:34:56,960
Two hard-shell crab dinners!

1222
01:34:57,035 --> 01:34:58,693
Pitcher of ice-cold beer!

1223
01:34:58,764 --> 01:35:00,520
Baked or fries?

1224
01:35:00,588 --> 01:35:01,962
Fries.

1225
01:35:06,157 --> 01:35:08,361
One baked, one fried.

1226
01:35:08,429 --> 01:35:11,014
I'll tell your waiter.

1227
01:35:11,085 --> 01:35:12,841
My waiter.

1228
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:18,245
Okay, now, I got a real great
compliment for you...

1229
01:35:18,318 --> 01:35:20,358
and it's true.

1230
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:22,470
I'm so afraid you're about
to say something awful.

1231
01:35:23,503 --> 01:35:25,958
Don't be pessimistic.
It's not your style.

1232
01:35:27,151 --> 01:35:29,572
Okay, here I go.

1233
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,032
Clearly a mistake.

1234
01:35:34,705 --> 01:35:38,895
I've got this, what, ailment?

1235
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:46,184
My doctor, a shrink that
I used to go to all the time...

1236
01:35:46,258 --> 01:35:48,909
says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases...

1237
01:35:48,978 --> 01:35:51,280
a pill really helps.

1238
01:35:52,307 --> 01:35:53,681
I hate pills.

1239
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:55,918
Very dangerous thing, pills.

1240
01:35:55,988 --> 01:36:00,593
I'm using the word "hate" here
about pills.

1241
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:03,507
My compliment is, that night...

1242
01:36:03,572 --> 01:36:06,888
when you came over and told me
that you would never...

1243
01:36:08,437 --> 01:36:12,496
All right, well, you were there.
You know what you said.

1244
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:15,021
Well, my compliment to you is...

1245
01:36:16,279 --> 01:36:20,654
the next morning
I started taking the pills.

1246
01:36:24,184 --> 01:36:26,737
I don't quite get
how that's a compliment for me.

1247
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:34,640
You make me want to be a better man.

1248
01:36:47,003 --> 01:36:49,938
That's maybe the best compliment
of my life.

1249
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,882
Well, maybe I overshot a little.

1250
01:36:56,956 --> 01:36:59,771
I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out.

1251
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:13,597
How's it goin' with those pills?

1252
01:37:15,071 --> 01:37:17,624
Good, I hope, I hope...

1253
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,414
It's little by little.

1254
01:37:27,553 --> 01:37:30,368
It's exhausting talking like this.

1255
01:37:50,147 --> 01:37:53,343
Do you ever let a romantic moment make
you do something you know is stupid?

1256
01:37:54,821 --> 01:37:55,868
Never.

1257
01:37:57,317 --> 01:37:59,837
Here's the trouble with "never."

1258
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:24,292
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

1259
01:38:26,633 --> 01:38:29,448
When you first came in to breakfast,
when I first saw you...

1260
01:38:29,513 --> 01:38:30,942
I thought you were handsome.

1261
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:34,825
Then, of course, you spoke.

1262
01:38:37,931 --> 01:38:41,127
So now that your...

1263
01:38:41,195 --> 01:38:43,366
soft little underbelly
is all exposed...

1264
01:38:43,436 --> 01:38:46,403
tell me, why did you
bring me here?

1265
01:38:52,621 --> 01:38:53,995
It's...

1266
01:38:57,773 --> 01:38:59,628
a personal question.

1267
01:38:59,694 --> 01:39:02,956
- Tell me, even if you're scared.
- Scared?

1268
01:39:03,022 --> 01:39:05,226
Tell me why you wanted me here.

1269
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:08,580
It's okay.

1270
01:39:08,655 --> 01:39:11,470
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1271
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,108
Well, I...

1272
01:39:15,152 --> 01:39:18,764
I don't know.

1273
01:39:18,832 --> 01:39:21,417
There's a lot of reasons.

1274
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:24,751
I thought... one thought...
maybe if you had sex with Simon...

1275
01:39:24,817 --> 01:39:26,410
What?

1276
01:39:28,498 --> 01:39:31,051
Well, that's just one idea.

1277
01:39:31,122 --> 01:39:32,910
That's why you brought me?

1278
01:39:32,979 --> 01:39:35,662
Like I'm a what...

1279
01:39:35,731 --> 01:39:38,316
and I owe you what?

1280
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:40,721
I don't know why I brought you.

1281
01:39:40,788 --> 01:39:45,163
That was just one thought that I had.
It came out first. That's all it was.

1282
01:39:45,236 --> 01:39:47,472
I thought, you kiss him, me.

1283
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:50,355
When you two seemed to hit it off...

1284
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:52,526
No, wait. That's... I didn't mean...

1285
01:39:52,597 --> 01:39:54,768
Forget what I said about Simon.

1286
01:39:54,838 --> 01:39:57,653
- I'll never forget you said it.
- It's a mistake.

1287
01:39:59,318 --> 01:40:00,878
It was a mistake.

1288
01:40:07,095 --> 01:40:09,331
- Hello, this is Fred Bishop,
-And Betty,

1289
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,571
We're sorry to be unable
to take your call right now,

1290
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,909
Please leave a message
with all the pertinent information,

1291
01:40:13,976 --> 01:40:15,667
-Say good-bye,
- Good-bye,

1292
01:40:15,736 --> 01:40:17,394
Thank you,

1293
01:40:17,465 --> 01:40:19,320
It's Simon.

1294
01:40:20,826 --> 01:40:22,681
I'm in town.

1295
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:30,610
Folks, you haven't been out later
that 1 0:00 in your entire lives.

1296
01:40:30,683 --> 01:40:32,985
Please pick up the phone.

1297
01:40:35,388 --> 01:40:36,762
Really.

1298
01:40:41,404 --> 01:40:43,346
I'll try you in the morning.

1299
01:40:43,421 --> 01:40:45,625
I need to see you...

1300
01:40:45,693 --> 01:40:48,824
or at least get you
to answer the phone.

1301
01:40:57,055 --> 01:40:59,804
How are you?

1302
01:40:59,871 --> 01:41:02,107
- Is this gonna be your room?
- Our room.

1303
01:41:02,175 --> 01:41:05,142
I don't wanna see him,
and he's not gonna knock on your door.

1304
01:41:05,215 --> 01:41:06,262
What happened?

1305
01:41:07,424 --> 01:41:09,279
Don't ask.

1306
01:41:11,744 --> 01:41:14,559
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1307
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:16,829
- Do you need help...
- No!

1308
01:41:18,978 --> 01:41:22,109
I'm taking a big bath
and ordering a big meal.

1309
01:41:22,178 --> 01:41:23,323
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1310
01:41:25,603 --> 01:41:28,832
I'm tired of my own complaints.
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1311
01:41:28,899 --> 01:41:30,459
What are you thinking about?

1312
01:41:31,939 --> 01:41:33,248
How to die, mostly.

1313
01:41:35,236 --> 01:41:38,335
Can you believe, in our little mix,
you're the good roommate?

1314
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,819
- Good night.
- Good night.

1315
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,715
Hold it.

1316
01:42:55,887 --> 01:42:58,854
- I have to draw you.
- Huh?

1317
01:43:00,624 --> 01:43:02,347
I have to draw you.

1318
01:43:04,432 --> 01:43:06,920
Absolutely not. I'm a lot
more shy than people think.

1319
01:43:06,992 --> 01:43:08,934
- I give off the wrong impression.
- I have to.

1320
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:10,798
I haven't sketched anything
in weeks.

1321
01:43:10,866 --> 01:43:13,517
Stop staring.
Do a vase.

1322
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:15,817
But you're beautiful.

1323
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:18,607
Your skin, your long neck...

1324
01:43:19,986 --> 01:43:22,604
the back, the line of you.

1325
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:27,409
You're why cavemen
chiseled on walls.

1326
01:43:30,868 --> 01:43:32,297
All right. Cut me a break.

1327
01:43:54,903 --> 01:43:56,845
The next thing I know she's...

1328
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,953
sitting right there next to me.

1329
01:44:00,024 --> 01:44:02,577
Well, it's not right
to go into details.

1330
01:44:02,649 --> 01:44:05,104
I got nervous.

1331
01:44:05,177 --> 01:44:07,730
I screwed up.
I said the wrong thing.

1332
01:44:11,194 --> 01:44:13,136
Where if I hadn't...

1333
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:16,505
I could be in bed right now
with a woman...

1334
01:44:16,571 --> 01:44:21,143
who if you make her laugh,
you got a life.

1335
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:26,362
Instead, I'm here with you.

1336
01:44:26,428 --> 01:44:29,908
No offense, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

1337
01:44:34,654 --> 01:44:36,509
jameson, soda back.

1338
01:44:38,942 --> 01:44:41,047
I'm sorry.
I don't care how you put this.

1339
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:45,013
- We're being naughty here, pal.
- No.

1340
01:44:45,087 --> 01:44:48,153
This is great.
This is so great.

1341
01:44:48,223 --> 01:44:51,223
I swear to God,
my hand won't even keep up.

1342
01:44:51,295 --> 01:44:53,466
- Hold it.
- I'm just turning.

1343
01:44:53,536 --> 01:44:56,219
- Then hold that. Hold any of them.
- Okay. This?

1344
01:44:56,289 --> 01:44:59,901
It doesn't matter.
My hand's not even bothering me.

1345
01:44:59,969 --> 01:45:02,838
I can't... I just...

1346
01:45:02,913 --> 01:45:05,815
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

1347
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:11,745
Oh, careful.

1348
01:45:22,821 --> 01:45:25,341
Coming in. It's late.

1349
01:45:31,654 --> 01:45:33,247
Did you have sex with her?

1350
01:45:34,118 --> 01:45:36,005
You're sure you
don't want your shampoos?

1351
01:45:40,903 --> 01:45:43,292
Sorry.

1352
01:45:43,367 --> 01:45:46,367
I didn't know
she was still here.

1353
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:49,341
- Did you have sex with her?
- To hell with sex.

1354
01:45:49,416 --> 01:45:51,805
It was better than sex.
We held each other.

1355
01:45:53,256 --> 01:45:56,572
What I need
he gave me great.

1356
01:45:56,649 --> 01:45:59,518
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1357
01:46:04,234 --> 01:46:06,089
I just love her.

1358
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:13,834
How are you doin'?

1359
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:31,459
- Hello?
- Mom? Hi.

1360
01:46:31,501 --> 01:46:34,916
Hello, Simon, you were right,
We were home last night,

1361
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:36,932
Do you have to whisper?
I can barely hear you.

1362
01:46:37,006 --> 01:46:39,591
- I'm not a screamer,
- No, no.

1363
01:46:39,663 --> 01:46:42,248
It was the luckiest thing
you didn't answer last night.

1364
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:44,359
- your father hasn't been feeling well,
- I can't hear you.

1365
01:46:44,432 --> 01:46:47,214
- It's too late to start, Hold on,
- Hold for what?

1366
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,549
What are you gonna do?
Where are you going?

1367
01:46:49,617 --> 01:46:52,399
I get why you're angry with me,
but it's no snap to...

1368
01:46:52,465 --> 01:46:55,334
- He's talking to his parents.
- Then you listen to me.

1369
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:58,409
Truly no grudges, okay?
Truly.

1370
01:46:58,482 --> 01:47:02,573
It was odd that you didn't come see me
when you heard I was hurt, but...

1371
01:47:02,642 --> 01:47:05,937
- We almost did,
- I don't even want to talk about it.

1372
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:08,938
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

1373
01:47:09,011 --> 01:47:11,978
- you do sound different,
- Yes, I'm working again.

1374
01:47:12,052 --> 01:47:15,216
- Good, About money...
- I don't need anything.

1375
01:47:15,284 --> 01:47:17,673
I'll drop you a line
from wherever I land.

1376
01:47:17,748 --> 01:47:20,650
Then it's up to you to make
the next move, and I hope you do.

1377
01:47:20,725 --> 01:47:22,667
He's gonna want to stay.

1378
01:47:22,741 --> 01:47:26,221
They'll want to take a ride
to the lake or whatever.

1379
01:47:26,294 --> 01:47:29,196
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye, dear,

1380
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:32,172
- He's gonna feel stirred up.
- Bye, Mom.

1381
01:47:32,246 --> 01:47:34,482
We'll probably have
a good five-hour drive.

1382
01:47:34,551 --> 01:47:37,136
- It'll give us a chance to relax...
- So?

1383
01:47:37,207 --> 01:47:39,596
- and be together alone.
- I'm coming with you.

1384
01:47:40,472 --> 01:47:43,341
- What about your parents?
- No, I'll take care of myself.

1385
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:47,028
What are you talking about?
You got real problems.

1386
01:47:47,929 --> 01:47:51,125
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1387
01:47:51,193 --> 01:47:54,870
Suddenly everything
seems so easy.

1388
01:47:54,937 --> 01:47:57,937
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1389
01:48:00,506 --> 01:48:03,605
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1390
01:48:05,211 --> 01:48:09,270
- Ah, geez. No choice.
- I got a gift for you.

1391
01:48:09,339 --> 01:48:12,885
Nothing like no choice
to make you feel at home.

1392
01:48:12,957 --> 01:48:15,062
Let me see.

1393
01:48:15,133 --> 01:48:17,467
Ah. Gorgeous.

1394
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:22,235
Do it then, and pick up the dog.
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1395
01:48:22,302 --> 01:48:23,676
Good-bye.

1396
01:48:25,182 --> 01:48:27,353
Your luck's running.

1397
01:48:27,422 --> 01:48:30,870
They sublet your place.
You're homeless.

1398
01:48:32,799 --> 01:48:36,028
Frank's got a line on another place
you can use for now.

1399
01:48:36,096 --> 01:48:39,479
- Another place where?
- Does it matter?

1400
01:48:43,937 --> 01:48:46,009
It doesn't.

1401
01:48:46,881 --> 01:48:49,150
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1402
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:52,635
I'm sorry.

1403
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:18,557
I love you

1404
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:23,645
For sentimental reasons

1405
01:49:23,718 --> 01:49:26,173
I don't want to hear
that music right now.

1406
01:49:26,246 --> 01:49:29,115
- You said you liked it.
- I don't.

1407
01:49:31,432 --> 01:49:34,694
- This one has a meaning.
- It's your call...

1408
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:37,542
but I don't want to hear it,
if that means anything.

1409
01:49:56,491 --> 01:49:58,727
Yes, sir. All right.

1410
01:49:58,795 --> 01:50:02,886
Here's the keys
to my apartment.

1411
01:50:02,956 --> 01:50:07,146
You go up there and wait.
I'm gonna take Carol home.

1412
01:50:08,044 --> 01:50:10,433
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

1413
01:50:16,782 --> 01:50:19,302
Can you come here?

1414
01:50:19,374 --> 01:50:22,189
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1415
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:25,828
I don't think
I want to know you anymore.

1416
01:50:25,903 --> 01:50:28,488
All you do is make me
feel bad about myself.

1417
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,775
You have my number.

1418
01:50:36,177 --> 01:50:38,184
Let him take you home.

1419
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:40,112
I don't want to.

1420
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:44,236
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1421
01:50:53,683 --> 01:50:55,538
Don't say anything.

1422
01:50:58,388 --> 01:51:02,032
I gotta get ahold of Frank,
see where I'm hanging my hat.

1423
01:51:02,101 --> 01:51:04,337
Well...

1424
01:51:04,405 --> 01:51:07,056
I think you're gonna
have to camp it here.

1425
01:51:07,125 --> 01:51:10,060
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, look! There's Verdell!

1426
01:51:10,134 --> 01:51:11,410
Look at you!

1427
01:51:11,478 --> 01:51:13,452
- Come here.
- Look at you.

1428
01:51:19,255 --> 01:51:21,710
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1429
01:51:24,087 --> 01:51:26,989
Sorry.
You're just fun to mess with.

1430
01:51:29,368 --> 01:51:34,289
They rented your place furnished.
jackie brought your personal things.

1431
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:37,656
They were gonna set you up in here.
It's an extra room.

1432
01:51:37,722 --> 01:51:39,577
I never use it.

1433
01:51:39,642 --> 01:51:42,544
It's got good light.
No other choice, really.

1434
01:51:42,618 --> 01:51:44,473
I'm coming.

1435
01:51:46,586 --> 01:51:50,896
It's nice.

1436
01:51:50,971 --> 01:51:52,978
It looks good.

1437
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:57,115
They got your music...

1438
01:51:57,181 --> 01:51:59,636
paintings, paints.

1439
01:51:59,709 --> 01:52:01,814
Have to say
they did a good job.

1440
01:52:04,989 --> 01:52:07,477
Well, it's gonna be okay, huh?

1441
01:52:07,549 --> 01:52:10,418
- Cozy, huh?
- Yeah.

1442
01:52:15,903 --> 01:52:16,950
Thank you.

1443
01:52:19,103 --> 01:52:20,532
You overwhelm me.

1444
01:52:27,328 --> 01:52:28,669
I love you.

1445
01:52:34,978 --> 01:52:37,312
I tell you, buddy.

1446
01:52:37,378 --> 01:52:40,673
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1447
01:52:53,028 --> 01:52:55,166
Make yourself at home.

1448
01:52:57,317 --> 01:53:00,546
Anything else in the bag?

1449
01:53:00,613 --> 01:53:04,093
- I played soccer while you were away.
- Yeah, I know.

1450
01:53:04,166 --> 01:53:07,482
I love my cookbook.

1451
01:53:07,558 --> 01:53:10,787
It's great. It's got all
these wonderful recipes in here.

1452
01:53:10,855 --> 01:53:14,238
It says something for shark.
I never fixed shark before.

1453
01:53:14,311 --> 01:53:17,627
"Shark With A Bite."
Would you like that, Spencer?

1454
01:53:17,703 --> 01:53:20,605
There's some cookies here
called "Wasps' Nest."

1455
01:53:23,785 --> 01:53:27,168
Where is my big, hairy boy?

1456
01:53:27,241 --> 01:53:29,630
Where is he?

1457
01:53:29,706 --> 01:53:32,968
Where is my beautiful boy?
Sweetheart.

1458
01:53:34,282 --> 01:53:36,453
Oh, you're in bed.

1459
01:53:36,522 --> 01:53:38,213
Oh, no.

1460
01:53:39,178 --> 01:53:40,771
Yeah.

1461
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:46,791
I just didn't think Verdell
should get too comfortable...

1462
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:48,715
- sleeping in here.
- Look.

1463
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,235
- It's not gonna...
- The dog's already comfortable.

1464
01:53:55,021 --> 01:53:56,297
Is this okay?

1465
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:02,633
It's me. Hi!

1466
01:54:02,702 --> 01:54:04,393
Yes.

1467
01:54:04,462 --> 01:54:08,040
He took me in. Yes.
It's Carol for you.

1468
01:54:08,111 --> 01:54:11,177
I practically fainted
when I walked in.

1469
01:54:11,248 --> 01:54:13,255
- Take the dog.
- I gotta go.

1470
01:54:13,327 --> 01:54:17,255
-Just take the dog.
- Oh, come here.

1471
01:54:18,864 --> 01:54:20,904
Come on. Move faster.

1472
01:54:20,977 --> 01:54:24,839
- Don't limp. Move fast.
- Good luck.

1473
01:54:38,259 --> 01:54:41,226
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

1474
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:45,675
- Not so hot.
- Why? What's wrong?

1475
01:54:45,748 --> 01:54:48,781
I don't know whether I'm
being sensible or hard on you.

1476
01:54:48,852 --> 01:54:50,859
Maybe both, Maybe,

1477
01:54:50,933 --> 01:54:54,894
See, right there, I don't know
whether you're being cute or crazy.

1478
01:54:54,965 --> 01:54:57,965
- Cute.
- Don't answer everything I say.

1479
01:54:58,038 --> 01:55:01,354
just listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

1480
01:55:02,775 --> 01:55:06,866
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1481
01:55:06,935 --> 01:55:09,870
And what I said on the street...

1482
01:55:09,943 --> 01:55:12,245
that was a bad thing to say.

1483
01:55:12,312 --> 01:55:16,469
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1484
01:55:18,905 --> 01:55:23,444
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1485
01:55:24,954 --> 01:55:28,053
But the truth is,
you do bother me enormously.

1486
01:55:28,122 --> 01:55:30,610
And I know that it...

1487
01:55:30,683 --> 01:55:33,301
I think that it's better for me
to not have contact with you...

1488
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:34,963
because you're not ready...

1489
01:55:35,036 --> 01:55:37,174
and you're a pretty old guy
to not be ready...

1490
01:55:37,244 --> 01:55:39,764
and I'm too old to ignore that.

1491
01:55:39,836 --> 01:55:42,967
But there were
extraordinary kindnesses...

1492
01:55:43,036 --> 01:55:44,891
that did take place.

1493
01:55:52,541 --> 01:55:54,101
Anyway, thanks for the trip.

1494
01:55:56,478 --> 01:55:58,899
Good night.

1495
01:55:58,975 --> 01:56:00,666
Okay if I say something now?

1496
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:06,647
Go ahead.

1497
01:56:09,152 --> 01:56:11,192
I should have danced with you.

1498
01:56:16,001 --> 01:56:17,856
Good night.

1499
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:41,826
- Are you gonna talk to me or not?
- I'm coming.

1500
01:56:52,614 --> 01:56:55,843
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1501
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:57,535
Extraordinary.

1502
01:56:57,607 --> 01:57:00,836
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1503
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:04,615
I'm dying here.

1504
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,931
Because...

1505
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,007
you love her.

1506
01:57:12,616 --> 01:57:15,845
And you people are supposed
to be sensitive and sharp?

1507
01:57:15,913 --> 01:57:18,760
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's "dying here."

1508
01:57:20,138 --> 01:57:21,185
I don't know.

1509
01:57:21,258 --> 01:57:23,909
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1510
01:57:23,979 --> 01:57:27,208
- I'll figure it out.
- Oh, please.

1511
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,812
I'm stuck.

1512
01:57:31,883 --> 01:57:35,047
I can't get back
to my old life.

1513
01:57:37,196 --> 01:57:39,301
She's evicted me from my life.

1514
01:57:39,373 --> 01:57:41,228
Did you really like it that much?

1515
01:57:41,293 --> 01:57:43,846
Well, it's better than this.

1516
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:46,634
Look, you,
I'm very intelligent.

1517
01:57:46,702 --> 01:57:49,549
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you're doing.

1518
01:57:49,614 --> 01:57:53,476
If you can't be at least mildly
interesting, then shut the hell up.

1519
01:57:53,550 --> 01:57:57,511
I'm drowning here,
and you're describing the water!

1520
01:57:57,584 --> 01:57:59,045
Picking on me won't help.

1521
01:58:01,552 --> 01:58:03,756
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1522
01:58:06,992 --> 01:58:09,480
Melvin, do you know
where you're lucky?

1523
01:58:13,842 --> 01:58:15,402
You know who you want.

1524
01:58:17,682 --> 01:58:20,584
I would take your seat
any day.

1525
01:58:20,659 --> 01:58:22,731
So do something about it.

1526
01:58:22,803 --> 01:58:25,356
Go over there now, tonight.
Don't sleep on it.

1527
01:58:25,428 --> 01:58:28,777
It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1528
01:58:28,852 --> 01:58:31,634
You can do this, Melvin.
You can do this.

1529
01:58:31,701 --> 01:58:34,963
Pull the stops.
Tell her how you feel.

1530
01:58:35,029 --> 01:58:38,641
- You can do this.
- Hey, I'm charged here.

1531
01:58:38,709 --> 01:58:41,938
- Yes, you are.
- She might kill me if I go over.

1532
01:58:42,006 --> 01:58:44,788
Then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story.

1533
01:58:44,854 --> 01:58:46,828
I really think
you have a chance here.

1534
01:58:46,903 --> 01:58:50,613
The best thing you have going for you
is a willingness to humiliate yourself.

1535
01:58:50,679 --> 01:58:53,941
So go over there, do this.
Catch her off guard.

1536
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:01,175
- Okay.
- Okay.

1537
01:59:03,577 --> 01:59:05,911
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1538
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:09,688
Here I go.

1539
01:59:18,171 --> 01:59:19,862
What's wrong?

1540
01:59:23,292 --> 01:59:24,917
I forgot to lock the door.

1541
02:00:40,838 --> 02:00:42,693
What do you want, Melvin?

1542
02:00:43,783 --> 02:00:46,685
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep.

1543
02:00:51,432 --> 02:00:53,155
What a break.

1544
02:00:55,272 --> 02:00:57,989
Is it a secret
what you're doing here?

1545
02:01:01,289 --> 02:01:02,663
I had to see you.

1546
02:01:06,731 --> 02:01:07,778
Because?

1547
02:01:11,242 --> 02:01:13,893
It relaxes me.

1548
02:01:15,564 --> 02:01:19,590
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb...

1549
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:20,870
than any other place...

1550
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:24,136
I can think of or imagine.

1551
02:01:24,205 --> 02:01:26,823
No, wait.
That's overstating.

1552
02:01:26,893 --> 02:01:30,439
I'd rather be sitting inside
on the steps...

1553
02:01:30,509 --> 02:01:32,614
'cause I don't want to
get my feet in the gutter.

1554
02:01:32,686 --> 02:01:34,180
- What would that serve?
- Stop it!

1555
02:01:34,254 --> 02:01:37,702
Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1556
02:01:37,774 --> 02:01:41,287
just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1557
02:01:41,359 --> 02:01:45,254
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1558
02:01:48,336 --> 02:01:51,303
Oh, I'm sorry.

1559
02:01:51,376 --> 02:01:54,191
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1560
02:01:59,474 --> 02:02:00,935
Boyfriend.

1561
02:02:05,074 --> 02:02:09,231
Come on in and try not
to ruin everything by being you.

1562
02:02:10,515 --> 02:02:13,264
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks.

1563
02:02:17,716 --> 02:02:19,571
Maybe we could.

1564
02:02:44,792 --> 02:02:48,087
It feels a little confined in here.

1565
02:02:48,153 --> 02:02:50,160
Let's take a walk.

1566
02:02:52,858 --> 02:02:55,279
See, it's 4:00 in the morning.

1567
02:02:55,353 --> 02:02:58,768
A walk sounds
a little screwy to me...

1568
02:02:58,842 --> 02:03:00,271
if you don't mind.

1569
02:03:00,346 --> 02:03:04,601
Well, if you need an excuse...

1570
02:03:04,667 --> 02:03:08,279
there's a bakery on the corner
that will be open soon.

1571
02:03:08,347 --> 02:03:10,736
That way we're not screwy.

1572
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:14,609
just two people
that like warm rolls.

1573
02:03:18,717 --> 02:03:20,091
Okay.

1574
02:03:37,728 --> 02:03:39,964
What are you doing?

1575
02:03:40,032 --> 02:03:42,847
I still want you to hear
part of that car song.

1576
02:03:42,912 --> 02:03:44,767
You don't have to...

1577
02:03:51,106 --> 02:03:53,277
And darlin'

1578
02:03:53,346 --> 02:03:56,313
I'm never lonely

1579
02:03:56,386 --> 02:04:00,215
Whenever you're in sight

1580
02:04:00,291 --> 02:04:02,146
Thank you.

1581
02:04:03,523 --> 02:04:05,378
You know, I was hoping...

1582
02:04:19,718 --> 02:04:23,842
I'm sorry. Whatever this is
is not gonna work.

1583
02:04:32,808 --> 02:04:35,426
- I'm feel...
- What?

1584
02:04:37,416 --> 02:04:39,750
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1585
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,383
Even though
it may seem that way now...

1586
02:04:44,457 --> 02:04:47,424
you don't know me all that well.

1587
02:04:47,498 --> 02:04:48,927
I'm not the answer for you.

1588
02:04:49,002 --> 02:04:52,580
Hey, I've got
a great compliment for you.

1589
02:04:54,058 --> 02:04:57,222
- You know what?
-Just let me...

1590
02:04:57,291 --> 02:04:59,146
Let me talk.

1591
02:05:04,908 --> 02:05:08,486
I might be the only person
on the face of the Earth...

1592
02:05:08,556 --> 02:05:10,977
that knows you're
the greatest woman on Earth.

1593
02:05:11,053 --> 02:05:14,828
I might be the only one
who appreciates...

1594
02:05:14,894 --> 02:05:19,334
how amazing you are in every
single thing that you do...

1595
02:05:19,406 --> 02:05:22,188
and how you are with Spencer.

1596
02:05:22,254 --> 02:05:23,464
Spence.

1597
02:05:24,591 --> 02:05:28,268
In every single thought you have
and how you say what you mean...

1598
02:05:28,336 --> 02:05:30,791
and how you almost always
mean something...

1599
02:05:30,864 --> 02:05:35,272
that's all about
being straight and good.

1600
02:05:37,648 --> 02:05:40,069
I think most people
miss that about you.

1601
02:05:40,145 --> 02:05:42,185
I wonder how they
can watch you...

1602
02:05:42,257 --> 02:05:45,126
bring their food
and clear their tables...

1603
02:05:45,202 --> 02:05:48,715
and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1604
02:05:49,842 --> 02:05:51,947
And the fact that I get it...

1605
02:05:52,019 --> 02:05:53,874
makes me feel good...

1606
02:05:55,667 --> 02:05:57,128
about me.

1607
02:06:05,781 --> 02:06:08,432
Is that something that's...

1608
02:06:08,501 --> 02:06:10,835
bad for you to be around
for you?

1609
02:06:25,592 --> 02:06:26,802
I'm gonna grab ya.

1610
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:31,317
I didn't mean for that
to be a question.

1611
02:06:31,384 --> 02:06:33,239
I'm gonna grab ya.

1612
02:06:55,835 --> 02:06:57,722
I know I can do better than that.

1613
02:07:21,055 --> 02:07:23,291
Better.
Definitely better.

1614
02:07:28,801 --> 02:07:29,849
See?

1615
02:07:47,063 --> 02:07:48,863
Warm rolls.

1616
02:07:57,841 --> 02:07:59,641
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

1617
02:12:38,704 --> 02:12:43,299
