1
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:32,194
I'm going to get some flowers, dear.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

2
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,224
It's tulip season today,
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,774
Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,319
Yes, come on now, sweetheart.

5
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,956
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

6
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,895
Go for a ride.

7
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,626
Come on, sweetie.

8
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,396
Freeze!
Leg down, leg down.

9
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:17,534
That's it.
Come on now.

10
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,807
No, you monkey-eared
son of a bitch!

11
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,979
You have pissed your last floor.

12
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,223
Bet you wish
you were a real dog.

13
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,226
Oh, you dog-eared monkey.

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,392
This is New York.

15
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,957
If you can make it here,
you can make it anywhere...

16
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,296
you ugly, smelly...

17
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,507
- Verdell!
- Uh-oh.

18
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,947
Where's my good doggie?
Verdell?

19
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,891
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,562
- Mr. Udall?
- Mm-hmm?

21
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,824
Have you seen Verdell?

22
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,727
What does he look like?

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,698
My dog. You know, my...

24
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,006
My dog with the little,
adorable face.

25
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,806
Don't you know
what my dog looks like?

26
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,611
Oh, I got it.
You were talking about your dog.

27
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,919
I thought it was the name
of that colored man I see in the hall.

28
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,992
Which color was that?

29
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,028
Like thick molasses...

30
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,390
- with a broad nose...
- Frank!

31
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,933
Perfect for smelling
trouble and prison food.

32
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,967
- Simon, you've got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs, Melvin Udall.

33
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,472
How are you doin'?

34
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,270
Frank shows my work,
Mr. Udall.

35
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,504
- I think you know that.
- People are gonna start coming.

36
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,879
What I know is that as long as you
keep your work zipped up around me...

37
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,976
I don't give a rat crap
what or where you shove your show.

38
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,954
Are we done
being neighbors for now?

39
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:17,054
- Let me talk to you...
- No! Not worth it.

40
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,391
Definitely not worth it.
Verdell must be in the apartment.

41
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,292
Okay.

42
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,005
Hope you find him.
Love that dog.

43
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,535
You don't love anything,
Mr. Udall.

44
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,958
One, two, three, four, five.

45
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,137
One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,502
Okay.

47
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,694
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

48
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,978
- Hi, Carl.
- Frank, where is he?

49
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,079
- Isn't he here? He lives here.
- Take it easy.

50
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,023
- He had a little thing with the dog.
- It's not such a hot-looking dog.

51
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,526
He's adorable.

52
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,427
Who buys more than me?
He isn't the only one working.

53
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,956
Good Lord.
Where have you been?

54
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,969
Oh, look at my boy.

55
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:08,768
Look at him.

56
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,006
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

57
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,143
Where was my little baby?

58
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,153
In the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

59
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:30,458
- Go ahead, John. You earned your fun.
- Sorry. It just struck me.

60
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,021
- It's funny.
- Oh, wait.

61
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,997
How did he get down
in the basement...

62
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,003
even if he got
in the elevator?

63
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,540
Maybe some nice neighbor
shoved him down the garbage chute?

64
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,043
Somewhere in the dark...

65
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,915
she had confessed,
and he had forgiven.

66
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,887
"This is what you live for,"
he said.

67
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,823
"Two heads on a pillow,
where all is approval...

68
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,883
and there is only the safety...

69
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,055
of being with each other."

70
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,623
How, she wondered,
could she find such hope...

71
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,693
in the most shameful part of her?

72
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,540
At last she was able
to define love.

73
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,967
Love was...

74
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,037
Mr. Udall, I'd like
to speak to you, please.

75
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,776
Let me do this by myself.

76
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,979
- Love was...
- Are you in there?

77
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,487
Son of a bitch!

78
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,723
Pansy-ass stool pusher.

79
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,555
Yes?

80
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,593
Maybe this can wait.

81
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,656
I found Verdell.

82
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,273
Well, that's a load off.

83
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,610
Uh-huh.
Did you do something to him?

84
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,514
Do you realize
that I work at home?

85
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,616
I wasn't aware.

86
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:06,819
Do you like to be interrupted when
you're nancing around in your garden?

87
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,924
No. I actually...

88
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,933
will turn the ringer off on my phone
and put cardboard...

89
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,868
Well, I work all the time...

90
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,135
so never, never interrupt me,
okay?

91
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,870
Not if there's a fire.

92
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,174
Not even if you hear the sound
of a thud from my home...

93
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,841
and one week later there's
a smell coming from there...

94
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,749
that can only be
a decaying human body...

95
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:34,752
and you have to hold a hanky
to your face...

96
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,017
because the stench is so thick
you think you're gonna faint.

97
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,288
Even then,
don't come knocking.

98
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,727
Or if it's election night...

99
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,357
and you're excited
and you want to celebrate...

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,659
because some fudge packer
you date...

101
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,068
has been elected the first queer
president of the United States...

102
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,801
and he's going to have you...

103
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,571
down to Camp David...

104
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,738
and you want someone
to share the moment with.

105
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,214
Even then...

106
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,081
don't knock...

107
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,313
not on this door...

108
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,754
not for any reason.

109
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,883
Do you get me, sweetheart?

110
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,892
Yes.

111
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:23,026
It's not a subtle point
that you're making.

112
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,204
Okay then.

113
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:43,183
So the theory of confrontations says:
"Think twice before messing with me."

114
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,995
All right.

115
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,799
Love was...

116
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,204
What was love?

117
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,438
Love was...

118
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,807
Now I am pissed.
Now I am really pissed!

119
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,981
Don't touch! Don't touch!

120
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,150
Shut up! You think you can intimidate
the whole world with your attitude.

121
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,718
You don't intimidate me.
I grew up in hell, homeboy.

122
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,991
My grandmother had more attitude.

123
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,694
Police!
Donut-munching morons.

124
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,932
Help me!

125
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,802
Shut up!

126
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,274
Assault and battery,
and you're black!

127
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:41,939
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable...

128
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,415
if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

129
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,053
Meantime...

130
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,491
I'm gonna think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

131
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,320
I hate doing this!

132
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,921
I'm an art dealer.

133
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,500
Have a nice day.
Okay, party!

134
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,824
- Excuse me.
- Whoa. Don't touch.

135
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,360
Get a life.

136
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,530
- Watch it.
- Don't touch.

137
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,466
- Look at you. You're all better.
- It's that new medication.

138
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,274
You know all my son's stuff, right?
No, no. I got a date tonight.

139
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,907
I'm walking out and he says,
"Mom, I promise not to get...

140
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,247
one of my fevers or coughs
during your date."

141
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,379
- Isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

142
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,021
It came out of me: "You love me
the way you love your remote control.

143
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,790
As long as I switch every time
you press one of my buttons."

144
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,797
That's terrific.

145
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,891
People that talk in metaphors
oughta shampoo my crotch.

146
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,269
- Eat up.
- Stay there. I've got your money.

147
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,467
- No, pay me next week.
- I owe you.

148
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,476
I told you today.
That's the rule.

149
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,535
- Excuse me, Melvin.
- Don't...

150
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,977
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

151
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,289
Pardon me.

152
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,016
Take the money.
Debts make me crazy.

153
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,427
This way you take a cab home
so you can get ready for the date.

154
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,297
Ready is not my problem.

155
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,857
I'm starving.

156
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,166
Go on. Sit down. You know
you're not allowed back here.

157
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,035
Spence is more excited than I am.

158
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,941
He says, "I promise not to get
a fever or cough during your date."

159
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,538
Sometimes this kid,
you just want to...

160
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,412
I've gotJews at my table.

161
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,112
It's not your table.
It's the place's table. Behave.

162
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,246
This once you can sit
at someone else's station.

163
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,185
Or you can wait your turn.

164
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,923
- You have feelings for her?
- Well, yes.

165
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,901
How much more you got to eat?

166
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:26,071
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

167
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,340
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

168
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,577
- Let me talk to him.
- I don't care how many books he sells.

169
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,177
- Give him one more chance. Here I go.
- Barred for life.

170
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,891
- They left.
- Yeah. What do you know?

171
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,902
Bryan says he doesn't care
how long you've been coming.

172
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,307
You ever act like this again,
you're barred for life.

173
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,437
I'm gonna miss the excitement,
but I'll handle it.

174
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,245
Three eggs over easy...

175
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,615
two sausage,
six strips of bacon with fries.

176
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,586
Fries today.

177
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,955
A short stack,
coffee with cream and sweetener.

178
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,085
You're gonna die soon
with that diet.

179
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,653
We're all gonna die soon.
I will, you will.

180
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,958
It sure sounds like
your son will.

181
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,416
If you ever mention my son again...

182
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,390
you will never be able
to eat here again, understand?

183
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,302
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

184
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,936
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

185
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,574
Do you?

186
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,418
Yes.

187
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,760
- Yeah?
- Yes.

188
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,326
I'll get your order.

189
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,770
Wear my earrings tonight.

190
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,072
It's just so interesting
what you said at dinner.

191
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,412
You said it
like it was nothing.

192
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,457
Where's the bedroom?

193
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:57,224
This is sort of it.
I sort of sleep in here.

194
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,507
Don't worry about it.

195
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,356
What?

196
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,701
I don't know.

197
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,374
Grandma.

198
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,078
Maybe you'd better check.

199
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,086
What did you think
I was gonna do?

200
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,121
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mama!

201
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,128
I was hearing everything
that you were doing...

202
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,529
so I put these on
to give you privacy.

203
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,297
- So how was dinner?
- Hey, pal.

204
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,133
- How's your friend?
- Are you okay?

205
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,174
- Not bad.
- You got a temperature?

206
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,300
Scootch over.

207
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:22,404
- Where did your friend take you to eat?
- A nice place.

208
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,843
I have him.

209
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,419
- One more spit?
- I said I have him. He's waiting.

210
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,185
- Go.
- She has me.

211
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,556
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

212
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:39,086
- Give me a big hug.
- Carol, I have him.

213
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,190
I'm okay, Mom.
She has me. Go.

214
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,740
Close the curtains.

215
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,581
No, you can't smoke!
He can't take smoke!

216
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,752
- Magic.
- Oh.

217
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,755
Oh, God.
Well, that'll teach you.

218
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,766
I don't even notice it anymore.

219
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,531
All right. Come here.

220
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,182
You don't have to get that embarrassed.
It's a little bit of throw up.

221
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,378
Little bit of throw up.

222
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,448
Well, what shall we do?

223
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,653
Want me to write which trains you take
to get home, or you wanna lay down...

224
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,595
No, no.
I'll take a cab.

225
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,738
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

226
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,511
I just can't. I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

227
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,542
<i>Carl, take me off the speaker.</i>
<i>Did I tell you these are house seats?</i>

228
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,918
<i>You could use a break.</i>

229
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,617
<i>Hello. Carl?</i>

230
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,626
<i>You there?</i>

231
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,824
Okay. I just found a model.

232
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,669
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy. He bought me dinner.

233
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,672
Carl, right?

234
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,699
Hey, what's going on?

235
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,779
- Remember?
- I only need one.

236
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:40,648
You picked me up maybe a few weeks,
I don't know, some time ago.

237
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,847
This is for a portrait.
I need a pretty face.

238
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,815
Portrait?

239
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,725
I'll give you the address.
It's for tomorrow morning.

240
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,525
Brad Pitt. It's the shit.

241
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,225
- I don't get it.
- Do you read?

242
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,671
Who is it, baby?

243
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,578
Who is that, Verdell?

244
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,975
I'm sorry.
I told you today.

245
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,418
I was in the studio doing work,
and I just...

246
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,614
It's out here.

247
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,990
- Sure have great things.
- Gershwin is great, isn't he?

248
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,393
I usually make a big deal
about picking models...

249
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,421
but Carl is so thorough.

250
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,332
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your resume, huh?

251
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,531
This is not a nude.

252
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,377
Just kidding around.

253
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,644
So much for love.

254
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,716
Yet another pose.

255
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,755
Exactly what is
your previous experience?

256
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:55,055
How about that, hmm?
I'm running out of ideas here.

257
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,421
Then give me some direction.

258
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,398
Nothing.

259
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,664
I just watch until something
strikes me.

260
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,728
I mean, do anything
that you think of.

261
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:12,106
Wait for me to say "hold that pose,"
then try to comfortably hold it.

262
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,514
No direction.

263
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,082
Okay.

264
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,610
What I do is watch.

265
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,825
You ever watch somebody
who doesn't know you're watching them?

266
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,090
An old woman
sitting on a bus...

267
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,427
or kids going to school...

268
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,432
or somebody just waiting.

269
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,992
And you see this flash
come over them...

270
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,337
and you know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything external...

271
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,807
because that hasn't changed.

272
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,744
And when you see it,
they're sort of realer...

273
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,940
and they're more alive.

274
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,512
If you look at somebody long enough,
you discover their humanity.

275
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,512
Wow.

276
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,987
I know exactly what you mean.

277
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,692
Oh, my God.
Hold it.

278
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,869
- Hey, look out!
- Excuse me.

279
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:24,004
- Sorry.
- <i>I got on the third line of dialogue.</i>

280
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,486
I blanked. I had no clue
as to what the next line was.

281
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,852
- Ignores me.
- He said to me, "Last chance."

282
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,915
- Last chance.
- Oh, God.

283
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,482
I came back in.

284
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,425
Here she comes
to ignore me again.

285
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,158
I messed up
on the exact same line.

286
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,826
- Guess what.
- What?

287
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,836
He cast me!

288
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,201
Just what the world needs...
another actress.

289
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,499
Okay, okay.

290
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,482
Can't live without me, huh?

291
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,215
I'm finally gonna ask.

292
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,483
What's with the plastic
picnic ware?

293
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,720
Why don't you try ours?
You're afraid it isn't clean?

294
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,060
- You okay?
- I see the help. It's a judgment call.

295
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,700
So give yourself
a little pep talk.

296
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,168
Must try other people's
clean silverware...

297
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,797
as part of fun
of dining out.

298
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,433
What's wrong with your son?

299
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,911
Yeah. What do you care?

300
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,489
He's got to fight to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

301
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,152
He's allergic to dust.

302
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,891
This is New York, so his immune system
bails on him whenever there's trouble.

303
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:50,526
So an ear infection...
Is this bothering you?

304
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,572
An ear infection, whatever, sends us to
the emergency room six times a month...

305
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,943
where I get whatever nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

306
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,073
Nice chatting with you.

307
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,586
- His name?
- Spencer.

308
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,648
Okay.

309
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,953
Spence.

310
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:26,297
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

311
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,172
You can put on anything you want now.
I might be sort of done here.

312
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,277
For two weeks all we've done is work.
Let's play!

313
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,021
Vincent!

314
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,133
So you're practically finished, huh?

315
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,574
Yeah.
There is one more stage.

316
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,307
Where you going?

317
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,610
No place.
I was just gonna sneak a peek.

318
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,626
- You want some chocolate?
- No, he's not allowed.

319
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,932
Wait.

320
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,201
I gotta take off.
You want to say good-bye or anything?

321
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,971
- He's just gotta go. One second.
- No, wait.

322
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,344
I'm gonna look
at the painting.

323
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,886
Where are you going, sweetheart?

324
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,126
You want some water?
What is the matter with you?

325
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,354
You want some water?

326
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,359
Simon, wait!

327
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,242
Why are you doing this?

328
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,911
No. No, wait.

329
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,386
See.

330
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,817
- That painting in there...
- What, are you cruising him?

331
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,927
Excuse me.

332
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,870
- Help me!
- We gotta go.

333
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,803
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

334
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,157
So you call 9-1-1
and don't leave your name?

335
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,419
That's right.

336
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,220
Even a dumb geezer should know
Emergency automatically...

337
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,422
- No one got killed.
- Oh, is he dead?

338
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,996
Ask him.

339
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,363
What's wrong with you?

340
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:12,267
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name ya.

341
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:17,400
We will. If we can't, we'll come back
and ask you again and again.

342
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,706
What, you're trying to
intimidate me with that attitude?

343
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,476
I come from hell. My grandmother's
got more attitude than you.

344
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,244
Go shake down a 7-Eleven
for a day-old wiener.

345
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,914
It's just a matter of time, sir.
There's a painting of one of the guys.

346
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,924
Get some tape on it.

347
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,729
I've been praying for him
since I heard.

348
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,027
So, anyway, I'm on my way
to the hospital.

349
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,761
If you could just
watch the dog tonight.

350
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,871
- I'm sorry. No.
- Okay. Thanks.

351
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,876
Old bitch.

352
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,877
Damn dog.

353
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,783
You're taking him.
Yes, you are!

354
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,047
Get the hell out of the way!

355
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,284
You're taking him.
This will even the books. One night.

356
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,456
Wait, wait.

357
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:13,361
Do you want to say no to me?

358
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,922
Huh?

359
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:20,860
I don't want to say nothing
to you.

360
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,965
Because I've never felt as crazy
as I do right now.

361
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,171
I almost want you to say no.

362
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,782
Thanks for looking after him.

363
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,549
Hey! Where are you going?

364
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,852
- You can't do this.
- You don't wanna mess with me today!

365
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,852
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's ever been in here before.

366
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,460
Hey, Frank.

367
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,442
You're dead.

368
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,520
We don't have no dog food here.
We don't want no dog food here.

369
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,389
You'll eat what we got,
what we eat.

370
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,564
All right.

371
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,568
Don't do anything.

372
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:19,422
Where's the trust?

373
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,425
Never a break.

374
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:33,629
Dogs.

375
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:46,882
<i>Always look at the bright side</i>
<i>of your life</i>

376
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:55,124
<i>Always look at the lighter side</i>
<i>of your life</i>

377
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,598
God.

378
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:06,704
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

379
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,639
We're not going to sell anything if they
find out we're halfway through a show...

380
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,971
and we haven't sold
a single painting.

381
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,068
We can't reduce the price
at this stage.

382
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,636
What...
I'm in a free fall here.

383
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,545
- Yes?
- We can see him.

384
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,518
Okay. I'll meet you in there.

385
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,146
I will meet you in there.

386
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,156
Okay? One minute.

387
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,123
Thank you.
No, I'm here.

388
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,393
How are you doing, great one?

389
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,659
I haven't looked at myself yet.

390
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,133
I figured I could tell
from your reaction.

391
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,033
Oh, God.

392
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,138
That bad, huh?

393
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,567
I talked to the doctor,
and... Oh!

394
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,673
Okay. It's not that bad.

395
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:55,185
The doctors say you're gonna be
your old self in a couple of weeks.

396
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,743
The scars might take...

397
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,446
Oh, shit!

398
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,255
- Jackie.
- Yes?

399
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,392
Can you hand me a mirror,
please?

400
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,976
Wait.
I have a smaller one.

401
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,427
So how are things anyway?

402
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,155
How's Verdell?

403
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,595
Your neighbor, Mr. Udall.

404
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,724
Taking care of him.

405
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,234
How could you do that?

406
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,271
- No, Simon.
- He'll hurt him.

407
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,171
I promise. Not a chance.

408
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,108
I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

409
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,044
I'm always on the move.

410
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,248
Trust me.

411
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,113
You are very certain my dog is okay,
because you have no idea...

412
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,144
Your dog is fine, Simon.

413
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,789
Okay.

414
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,762
Waiting gives the devil time.

415
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,683
Oh, my.

416
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,395
Where did I go?

417
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,759
- Look how friendly he is.
- That's your dog?

418
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,801
What are you doing
with a dog?

419
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,739
Suckered in, set up,
pushed around.

420
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,778
You're not worried
someone might take it?

421
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:06,176
No, not until now,
for Christ's sake.

422
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,582
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna sit here.

423
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,855
Hey, puppy.

424
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,153
He's cute.

425
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,194
I love his little face.
It's so cute.

426
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,728
I wonder what breed he is.

427
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,126
He's a little dog.

428
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,298
Next time, if Bryan's not here,
you can bring him in.

429
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:34,105
How old are you?

430
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,612
If I guessed by your eyes,
I'd say you were 50.

431
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,179
If I went by your eyes,
I'd say you were kind.

432
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,153
So much for eyes.
How old are you?

433
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,849
You brought it up.

434
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,619
- No, I'm curious.
- Not that you're ugly.

435
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,185
Yeah. Easy, pal.
I can take the compliment.

436
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,824
But my knees knock when you
turn on the charm full blast.

437
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,626
But I mean,
what's with the dark?

438
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,335
Dawn patrol.

439
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:09,368
Major dawn patrol.
My son had a full-blown attack.

440
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:13,747
This time, for extra fun,
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

441
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:16,582
- So I get him home...
- No, no!

442
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:22,252
The dog.
The bacon's for the dog.

443
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:28,230
Last week I was playing the piano
for him, and he likes it.

444
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:32,235
So I decided I'm gonna...

445
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,600
make a joke.

446
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,265
So you're all set here.

447
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,670
Yeah.

448
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,678
I think it's a beautiful day
for our walk today.

449
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,685
Very nice.

450
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,561
Look at that. Look at him.

451
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,431
I gotta give you something.

452
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,939
I gotta give you something
real good too.

453
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:12,965
I'm gonna show it to you.
Come on, buddy.

454
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,279
Don't you be like me.

455
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:20,340
You stay just the way you are,
because you are a perfect man...

456
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,251
and I'm gonna take you home
and get you something to eat.

457
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:27,485
- What you love. Hear me?
- I'd like to be treated like that.

458
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:31,824
I'm gonna take you home right now
and get you something. Yes.

459
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,989
Let's go home
and do some writing.

460
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,458
He had made the girl happy...

461
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:40,663
and what a girl.

462
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,606
"You saved my life," she said.

463
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,401
"You'd better make it up to me."

464
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,981
Done.

465
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,748
Yes, I hate the doggie.

466
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,347
Ooh, 62 books.

467
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,552
Done.

468
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,289
We have to cut back expenses
every place we can.

469
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,560
- He has no medical insurance?
- No.

470
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:13,366
These are the food receipts here,
the household expenses.

471
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,372
Here's one for the dog again.

472
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,907
- I can read it. I got it.
- There you go.

473
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,876
- All the laundry and cleaners.
- Okay, good.

474
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,038
Boy, look at that, huh?

475
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,379
Oh, he likes it
at Chez Melvin, hmm?

476
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,882
What are you coming over here for?
I told you to sit here.

477
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:38,452
I can't cook with a dog near me.
Okay, just sit. Good.

478
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,488
We don't want any company.
I'll read you some Ralph Waldo Emerson.

479
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,499
Okay, have it your way.

480
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,336
How's Verdell doing?

481
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,809
You know,
he's a pain in the ass.

482
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,608
Well.

483
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,779
Simon's home.

484
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,654
I was hoping you can keep the dog
until he's had a chance...

485
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,387
to think and adjust.

486
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:14,522
Oh, it's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

487
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:16,691
No, he definitely
wants him back right away.

488
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,769
He'll be by tomorrow.

489
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,665
Okay.

490
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,675
Okay by me.

491
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,580
Hungry.
I'll be right with you, pooch.

492
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,521
One, two, three, four, five.

493
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,399
I'm okay.

494
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:40,616
Mr. Udall.

495
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,556
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like...

496
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,789
Could you take it...

497
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,423
just...

498
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,899
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

499
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,001
Thank you.

500
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,543
Come here, my beautiful boy.

501
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,608
Come here, boy.

502
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,812
Let's go home and get well.

503
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,186
You can't blame him
for being weird.

504
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,587
Have a look at yourself
in the mirror.

505
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,233
Thank you.

506
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,106
Come on, sweetheart.

507
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,107
Come here, boy.

508
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,849
I know what you want.

509
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,954
Where's my boy?

510
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,130
Don't force him.

511
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,564
Over a dog.

512
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,163
Over an ugly dog.

513
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:51,076
Worst sidewalk in New York.

514
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,082
Look where they put it.

515
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,757
Help!

516
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:05,192
If you want to see me,
you will make an appointment.

517
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:09,188
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder...

518
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,202
and then act as though I had
some choice about barging in?

519
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,635
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.

520
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:18,641
You said you could help me.
What was that, a tease?

521
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,610
I can help you
if you take responsibility...

522
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,045
- to keep regular appointments.
- You changed the room around.

523
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:27,083
Two years ago.
I also regrew my beard.

524
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,779
But you're not interested
in changes in me.

525
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:33,846
I don't have this mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

526
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,360
Do you know how hard it was
for me to come here?

527
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,688
- Yes.
- Thank you.

528
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,664
No, we're not doing this now.

529
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:47,670
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

530
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,213
What if this is
as good as it gets?

531
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,227
What the heck are those for?

532
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,799
No. Get Carol.

533
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,466
I'm filling in.

534
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,476
We don't know
if she's coming back.

535
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:30,513
She might be getting a job
closer to home.

536
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,919
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

537
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,779
What the heck do you mean?

538
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,347
Look, elephant girl...

539
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:44,417
just go get Carol or something.

540
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,225
Just have her do
my one meal here.

541
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,494
I'll pay whatever you want.
I'll wait.

542
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,798
Do it!

543
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,335
- Bryan, code blue.
- What happened?

544
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:09,149
Out!
Just shut up and get out!

545
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,449
Do it!

546
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,956
I'll be quiet.

547
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,390
Just let me stay here.

548
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,088
No problem.
Go get Carol.

549
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,225
Get her here.

550
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:26,167
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

551
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,363
I'm a great customer.

552
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:29,598
This day...

553
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,441
has been a disaster.

554
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:37,912
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out.

555
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,280
Get out immediately...

556
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,841
or there's gonna be trouble.

557
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,854
Man, I mean it.

558
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,295
Okay.

559
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,171
See ya. Good-bye.

560
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,037
It's about time!

561
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,878
Carol's last name.

562
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,445
- Connelly.
- Thank you.

563
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:17,211
Hey, Dad, I'm over here!

564
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,551
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not anymore.

565
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,026
What can you do?

566
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,496
Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?

567
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,870
Why not? You're a good girl.

568
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,306
Hello.

569
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:56,116
Christ.

570
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,504
I'm hungry.

571
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,215
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

572
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,980
What are you doing here?

573
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,079
This is not a sexist thing.
If you were a waiter...

574
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,091
Are you totally gone?
This is my private home.

575
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:34,928
I'm trying to keep emotion
out of this...

576
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,398
even though it's
an important issue to me...

577
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:40,698
and I have very strong feelings
on the subject.

578
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,565
What subject?

579
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,403
That I wasn't there to take crap
from you and bring you eggs?

580
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,639
Do you have any control over how
creepy you allow yourself to get?

581
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,581
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

582
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:01,147
And to prove it...

583
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:03,715
I have not gotten personal,
and you have.

584
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:07,756
Why aren't you at work?

585
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,455
You sick?

586
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,136
You don't look sick.

587
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,040
Just tired and bitter.

588
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,738
My son is sick, okay?

589
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,443
What about your mother?

590
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,245
How do you know
about my mother?

591
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:36,148
I hear you talking
while I wait.

592
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,627
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One second.

593
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:50,631
How're you doing?

594
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,141
You should answer someone
when they speak to you.

595
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,516
Melvin, that's it. I cannot handle
you teaching my son manners!

596
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,692
Back to life.

597
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,601
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

598
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,571
<i>Five one-thousand,</i>
<i>four one-thousand...</i>

599
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,768
three one-thousand,
two one-thousand...

600
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,367
bingo.

601
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:33,806
- 104.9.
- Let's treat ourselves to a cab ride.

602
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,282
Look out, you guys.
Coming through.

603
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,619
- Mom!
- We're okay.

604
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,192
Melvin, wait!

605
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,626
Melvin, wait!

606
00:47:58,341 --> 00:48:00,172
Shut up, kids!

607
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:04,413
Give us a lift,
would you, Melvin?

608
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,415
A lift. Okay.

609
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,844
Cover your mouth
when you cough, kid.

610
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,318
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
and quickly, please.

611
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,191
Okay.

612
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:20,820
- Hospital?
- Yes.

613
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:24,389
- Could you be back at work today?
- No!

614
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,868
Stay away from me!
God!

615
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,274
Simon, we can't
put this off any longer.

616
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,835
I feel terrible that I have to...

617
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,744
- Simon.
- Huh?

618
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,114
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

619
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,345
Sorry.

620
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,851
- What are those cards?
- Frank's idea.

621
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,896
He thought I should have notes
so I did this right...

622
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,465
maintained focus, didn't get emotional
and tried not to terrify you.

623
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,828
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

624
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,578
Simon, you're broke.

625
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:17,175
The medical bills
are $61,000 now...

626
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,154
and the show didn't go well.

627
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,452
I've spoken to your parents.

628
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,255
They didn't hang up
or anything...

629
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,593
but they said they would
feel strange about calling you.

630
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:31,862
Well, I can't call them.

631
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,163
Come here, baby.

632
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:39,374
Verdell. What's wrong?

633
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:44,937
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am, sweetheart!

634
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,377
Happy to see me,
you little pissant mop?

635
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,317
How about another ride
down the chute?

636
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,787
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

637
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,949
- Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

638
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,819
Sorry. I'm sorry.

639
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,896
I'll be able to keep
my apartment and the studio...

640
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,899
won't I?

641
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,769
Wow.

642
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,932
Oh, my God.

643
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:44,537
Yes, you write more than everybody else
and make us a lot of money.

644
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,542
- But it's more appropriate...
- Look.

645
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,840
I need this.
Just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

646
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,609
Okay?

647
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:59,444
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you. That's good.

648
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:04,585
On a pleasanter note, my son
just got accepted to Brown.

649
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,788
My husband was dying.

650
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:10,424
Yeah. Good, nice,
thrilled, exciting.

651
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,900
You don't have to wait with me.

652
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,577
I can't resist.

653
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:23,841
You usually move
through here so quickly.

654
00:51:23,913 --> 00:51:27,349
I have so many questions
I want to ask you.

655
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,875
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

656
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,888
What does it mean to you?

657
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:39,461
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

658
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,022
Oh, God.
This is like a nightmare.

659
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:47,798
Just a couple of questions.
How hard is that?

660
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,305
How do you write women so well?

661
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,571
I think of a man...

662
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,546
and I take away reason
and accountability.

663
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,431
- Where's my newspaper?
- It's right here, Mrs. Garrett.

664
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,627
"M.D."

665
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,605
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

666
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,446
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

667
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,679
What? Please, just tell me.

668
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,120
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.
- Not your name!

669
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:44,752
- Don't tell me your name! Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

670
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,524
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

671
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:50,498
- Did you know docs come to your house?
- No, I didn't.

672
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,365
- I'm home!
- So what are you doing here?

673
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,462
- I didn't know you had a secret admirer.
- What?

674
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:59,667
- Oh, you met the gift.
- He's good.

675
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:04,408
- I'm an expert on doctors.
- Okay, Doctor.

676
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:09,377
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

677
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,046
She said I was to take excellent care
of this little guy...

678
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,886
because you are urgently needed
back at work.

679
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,017
What kind of work do you do?

680
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,824
- I'm a waitress.
- In Manhattan.

681
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,502
Uh, yeah, Terry. Excuse me.

682
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,539
I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't know Brooklyn.

683
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:33,064
I couldn't find it either.
Could you get this to the lab?

684
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,544
Tell them I need CBC, differential,
platelets, the whole thing.

685
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:38,877
- And I want it back today.
- Okay.

686
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,884
I'm sorry. Did you say you're gonna
get the results back today?

687
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,886
Sure. Let's sit down.

688
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:49,225
These are the receipts
from all the prescriptions...

689
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,689
from the beginning of the year.

690
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:56,188
- The calendar.
- And this is a calendar of days...

691
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,958
and how he felt
and what he's been eating.

692
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:02,664
That's very good.
How long has he had the problem?

693
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,469
Since forever. Six months old.

694
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,238
- Have they done blood tests on him?
- Yeah.

695
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,709
Only in the emergency room
or when he was well?

696
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:14,706
- Emergency room only.
- How about skin testing for allergies?

697
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,016
- No.
- No standard scratch test?

698
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:23,218
No. I asked. They said my plan
didn't cover it and it wasn't necessary.

699
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,887
- Why? Should they have?
- Well...

700
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:29,454
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

701
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,959
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, that's their technical name.

702
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,607
So, once the tests come back...

703
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:42,611
is there someone in your office
we should talk to to get the results?

704
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,809
Um, me. My home number's on the card.

705
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,185
That's his home number.

706
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,960
- What?
- It's your home number!

707
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:08,136
Can we get you anything else?
Do you want some water or some coffee?

708
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,298
- No, thank you.
- A couple of female slaves?

709
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,136
Mrs. Connelly, there's still
a lot of tests I need to do...

710
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,238
a lot of things
I have to find out here.

711
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:22,182
But look, whatever I find out,
I promise you, at the very least...

712
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:26,552
from now on your son is going to feel
a great deal better, okay?

713
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:35,956
Doc!

714
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,839
No. Oh, fine. Okay.

715
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:45,568
That's good.

716
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:54,642
So, listen, you gotta let me know
about the additional costs.

717
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,946
One way or another, we'll...

718
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,351
Well, the costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

719
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:03,819
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

720
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,330
That's wonderful!

721
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:17,832
Anyway, dear.
Thank you for everything, Nora.

722
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:22,606
Forgive my recent crankiness.
I'll call when things get back on track.

723
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,587
Huh? What's wrong?

724
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,091
- Who's gonna walk Verdell?
- Oh, no!

725
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,945
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

726
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:04,142
Would there be any way
that you would be willing...

727
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,279
to walk his dog for him?

728
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,983
Absolutely.

729
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,624
You're a wonderful man.

730
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:18,063
2:00 would be a good time,
and here is the key...

731
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,159
in case he is asleep.

732
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,338
Open his curtains for him...

733
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:26,773
so he can see God's beautiful work.

734
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:31,041
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

735
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:36,743
Did they teach you to talk like this
in some "Sailor, wanna hump-hump" bar?

736
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:39,788
Or is this getaway day
and your last shot at his whiskey?

737
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:43,349
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

738
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:58,697
A seriously goofy man is behind this.
You're not allowed to block that out.

739
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,039
Do you really want to go
back to Emergency...

740
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,170
where those runt doctors
keep telling us that they can't help?

741
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:07,410
- This lets a crazy man into our lives.
- Let's not fight.

742
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,451
You know how this will turn out.
Come on!

743
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,484
You know how this will turn out.

744
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,320
This is not like stockings.
It's not like a string of pearls.

745
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,885
You don't send this one back.

746
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,394
Right?

747
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,105
<i>No, I do. I understand.</i>

748
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,739
<i>Listen, I gotta go, okay?</i>

749
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:44,977
Bye-bye.

750
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,393
What a day. Come here.

751
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:57,399
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

752
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:00,061
Thank you for walking him.

753
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,973
If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling so well.

754
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,010
This place smells like shit.

755
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:09,442
Go away.

756
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,339
- This cleaning lady doesn't...
- Please, just leave!

757
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,914
What happened to your queer
party friends?

758
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,456
Get outta here!

759
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,958
Nothing worse than having to feel
this way in front of you.

760
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:34,434
Nellie, you're a disgrace
to depression.

761
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:40,068
Rot in hell, Melvin.

762
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,078
No need to stop being a lady.

763
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,579
Quit worrying.

764
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,840
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

765
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,083
Is this fun for you?

766
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:04,058
You lucky devil. It just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

767
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,796
I'm losing my apartment.

768
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:12,330
And Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

769
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:14,376
And I won't.

770
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:17,901
I don't want to paint anymore.

771
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,416
So the life that I was trying for
is over.

772
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,611
The life that I had is gone...

773
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:28,051
and I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself
that it's difficult to breathe.

774
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,558
It's high times for you, isn't it?

775
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:34,357
The gay neighbor is terrified.

776
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,829
Terrified!

777
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,975
I was just trying to give you a boost.

778
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,316
Lucky you.

779
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,148
You're here for rock bottom...

780
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,156
you absolute horror of a human being.

781
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,568
The one thing I'll do for you...
I might cheer you up.

782
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,200
Get out.

783
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,678
You wanna know
why the dog prefers me?

784
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,906
It's not affection.
It's a trick.

785
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,949
I keep bacon in my pocket.

786
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:35,991
See?

787
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,184
Oh, my gosh.

788
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:46,267
We'll both call him.
You'll see.

789
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:47,700
It's a trick.

790
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:58,577
Come here, Verdell.

791
01:02:05,454 --> 01:02:07,012
Come on.

792
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,656
Come here, baby. It's okay.

793
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,730
Just stupid. A stupid dog.

794
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,929
Could you leave now?

795
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:27,098
Please?

796
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,579
I don't get it.

797
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,499
Taxi!

798
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,666
<i>Watch again with Nick At Nite's</i>
<i>Classic TVRewind.</i>

799
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,467
<i>On repeat viewing,</i>
<i>one begins to suspect...</i>

800
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:08,603
<i>that might not really be Major Healy</i>
<i>in the phone booth after all.</i>

801
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,846
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

802
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,160
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

803
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:38,169
If you're, uh...

804
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:44,873
If you're worried about thanking me...

805
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,747
That's not why I'm here.

806
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:52,481
Though you have no idea what it's like
to have a real conversation...

807
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,250
with a doctor about Spencer.

808
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:59,421
Note. Put it in a note.

809
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:12,572
I have a hair dryer...

810
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,908
Why did you do this for me?

811
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,513
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

812
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,918
Do you have some idea
how strange that sounds?

813
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,487
Well, I mean...

814
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,491
I'm worried you did this be...

815
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:49,603
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

816
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,240
Look.

817
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,854
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

818
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:03,517
I don't think this can wait.
I need to clear this up now.

819
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:05,785
Clear what up?

820
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,428
I'm not going to sleep with you.

821
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,401
I will never sleep with you!
Never, ever!

822
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,668
Not ever!

823
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,815
I'm sorry, but...

824
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,451
we don't open for the "no sex" oaths
until 9:00 a.m.

825
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,788
I'm not kidding.

826
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,925
Anything else?

827
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,325
Just...

828
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,603
thank you.

829
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,742
So you'll be at work tomorrow?

830
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,815
Yes.

831
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:17,889
"Never," she says.

832
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:40,621
I took a chance you were up.

833
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,391
I brought you some Chinese soup.

834
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,053
Thanks.

835
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,779
I've never been this tired
in my life.

836
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,627
I haven't been sleeping.

837
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,988
I haven't been clear in my head...

838
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,432
or felt like myself.

839
01:08:29,471 --> 01:08:30,529
I'm in trouble.

840
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,467
It's not just the tiredness.

841
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:39,310
- Boy.
- Sick. Nauseous.

842
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,349
Sleepy.

843
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,544
Where everything looks distorted...

844
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,712
and everything inside you...

845
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:50,088
kind of aches and you can barely find
the will to complain.

846
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,922
Yeah.

847
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,633
I'm glad we did this.

848
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:02,027
Good talking to you.

849
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,145
You are not still writing
that thank-you note.

850
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,840
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

851
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,911
C-O-N-S-C-l-E-N-C-E.

852
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:24,618
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

853
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:28,928
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

854
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:32,057
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

855
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:35,592
You better start finding something else
to do with your free time.

856
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:39,468
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yes.

857
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:41,873
All right. We got pizza.

858
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,072
Carol and I are going out.
Sausage and pepperoni.

859
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,513
You want to make this later
for you and Spencer?

860
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,110
We are going out, like people do.

861
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,988
If you can't feel good
about this break...

862
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,154
and step out a little...

863
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,059
then I think you
ought to have Mr. Udall...

864
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,431
send you over a psychiatrist.

865
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:10,404
I don't need one, because I know
what's really going on here!

866
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,176
I gotta finish this letter
or I'll go nuts.

867
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,872
This can't be right.
"Con-science?"

868
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:26,846
What?

869
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:47,606
It's very weird now
not feeling that...

870
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,577
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

871
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:55,842
Without that, I just
start thinking about myself.

872
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,853
And what good does that
ever get anybody?

873
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:06,216
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple...

874
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,259
and I felt myself...

875
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:11,732
giving them a dirty look.

876
01:11:14,736 --> 01:11:19,070
I just had no idea everything was...

877
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,511
Go ahead.

878
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,655
Moving in the wrong direction.

879
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,851
Away from a time...

880
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:41,885
when I remembered what it was like
to have a man to anything.

881
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,728
Hold fucking...

882
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,962
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

883
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,268
Hands with, for Christ's sake!

884
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:58,239
I felt almost really bad...

885
01:11:58,313 --> 01:11:59,940
that Dr. Bettes is married.

886
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:08,055
Which is probably why I make Spencer
hug me more than he wants to.

887
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:13,127
Poor kid doesn't have enough problems.

888
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:16,130
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

889
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:22,269
Who needs these thoughts?

890
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,265
So what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

891
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:29,003
Leave me be!
Why are you doing this?

892
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:31,637
What is it you want?

893
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,807
I hope getting me to think about
everything that's wrong...

894
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,850
when all I want to do
is not do that...

895
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,886
has some purpose.

896
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:43,957
Really, Mom, what is it you want?
What?

897
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,290
I want us to go out.

898
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,000
Okay.

899
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:18,783
Thank you.

900
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,055
Now I gotta send you
a thank-you note.

901
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:25,859
Oh, look. Evelyn's here
and her giant, Joey.

902
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,696
That's really
why you brought me here?

903
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,368
Well, you know,
it's not even mine.

904
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:37,640
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

905
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:41,809
But the dog did throw up
twice last night and his spark is off.

906
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:44,818
- Well, take him to the vet.
- I did.

907
01:13:44,886 --> 01:13:49,084
They say his stomach's out of whack
and they need him for a couple of days.

908
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:50,751
Well, do it!

909
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,657
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

910
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:58,956
- This is for later.
- What's this?

911
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,762
- It's a note.
- A note?

912
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,431
Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

913
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,767
Thank-you note? No, no.

914
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,277
- You can read it later.
- No, thank you.

915
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,108
No thank-you note.

916
01:14:15,283 --> 01:14:17,114
Thank you.

917
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,084
She's nice.

918
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,054
- Yeah.
- Real nice, huh?

919
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,065
Really nice.

920
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:38,195
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
telling somebody, "No thanks required"?

921
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,268
Sure looks like it went over too.

922
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,081
Look at you!

923
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:53,048
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

924
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,328
- What?
- Look at you.

925
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:04,126
- You think I'm a mark.
- You helped with the dog and now this.

926
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,100
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

927
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,229
- Concerned?
- It's not just financial assistance.

928
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:13,399
He's gotta get to Baltimore
to ask his parents for money tomorrow.

929
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:17,172
Well, yeah. I mean,
if his parents are alive.

930
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:19,213
They have to help.
It's the rules.

931
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,341
That's great.
Let them help him.

932
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,015
Only, uh...

933
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:31,355
I got a high-maintenance selling painter
coming through, so I'm out.

934
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,951
Can you drive him?

935
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,257
Think white and get serious.

936
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:41,762
Take my car. A convertible.

937
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,735
Do you drive?

938
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,833
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

939
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:51,310
Gettin' loud.

940
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,879
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

941
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:58,545
I want your life for one minute,
where my big problem is...

942
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:02,246
somebody offers me a free convertible
so I can get out of this city.

943
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:13,261
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay, I'll do it.

944
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,030
I'll take him.

945
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,129
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

946
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,765
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

947
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:22,469
- Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

948
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:27,280
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

949
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,874
We don't enjoy one another that much.

950
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:38,126
If there is a mental health foundation
that raises money for people like you...

951
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,185
please be sure to let me know.

952
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,061
Last-word freak.

953
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:46,828
- Good luck, lady.
- Was he talking to me?

954
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:50,235
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

955
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:55,274
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor
a lift to Baltimore.

956
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,841
What I did for you,
it's working out?

957
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,383
What you did changed my life.

958
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,958
No thank-you note.

959
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:21,332
Well, part of what I said
in this entire history of my life...

960
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:23,371
which you won't read...

961
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,066
is that somehow
you have done more...

962
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,372
for my mother, my son...

963
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:32,880
and me than anybody else ever has.

964
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:36,076
I'm just gonna read you
this part of it.

965
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:41,047
"And that makes you
the most important, surprising...

966
01:17:41,122 --> 01:17:43,215
generous person
I ever met in my life...

967
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,192
and that you're gonna be
in our prayers...

968
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,195
our daily prayers forever."

969
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:50,656
Lovely.

970
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:56,032
I also wrote one part
I'm just gonna say.

971
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,571
I wrote, "I'm sorry."

972
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:04,908
I was talking about I was sorry
when I got mad at you for...

973
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,177
when you came over and you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

974
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,185
So I wrote that I was sorry
about that and that l...

975
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:15,519
I was sorry for busting you on that
and busting in on you that night...

976
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,114
when I said I was never...

977
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:23,158
I was sorry, and I'm sorry
for every time your food was cold...

978
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,167
and that you had to wait two seconds
for a coffee filler...

979
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,193
and I'm sorry for never spotting right
there at the table in the restaurant...

980
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:33,298
the human being that had it in him
to do this thing for us.

981
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,071
You know what?
I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

982
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,443
"I have not been able...

983
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,142
to express my gratefulness to you.

984
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,185
Even as I look
at the word 'grateful' now...

985
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:46,277
it doesn't begin to tell you
what I feel."

986
01:18:50,558 --> 01:18:55,427
That's nice of you.
Thank you.

987
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,089
Thank you.

988
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:11,736
Now I want you to do something for me.

989
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,050
I'm sorry.
Didn't I say, "What?"

990
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:25,615
I thought I said "What?"

991
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:29,555
What?

992
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:32,065
I want you to go on this trip.

993
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,126
No, sir.

994
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:36,193
I can't do this without you.

995
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:40,401
I'm afraid he might pull
the stiff"one eye" on me.

996
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,204
I need you to chaperone.

997
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,677
Separate everything but cars.

998
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:47,374
You said you like convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook.

999
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,009
I'm sorry. The stiff"one eye"?

1000
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,076
- Two days.
- I can't. I work.

1001
01:19:52,153 --> 01:19:54,553
- You get off when you want to.
- My son.

1002
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:56,351
Bettes said he's doin' fine.

1003
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:00,617
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What's that got to do with it?

1004
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:04,791
- I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note, ain't she sweet.

1005
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,365
I need a hand,
and where did she go?

1006
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:10,302
Are you saying accepting your help
obligates me?

1007
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:14,264
Is there any other way to see it?

1008
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:27,617
Here's a little suitcase...

1009
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:30,556
shocked that it's being used.

1010
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,299
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

1011
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:10,063
- You're still comin', aren't you?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1012
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:13,325
I would like to know
exactly where we are going.

1013
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:19,672
Just south of Baltimore, Maryland,
and I know what you're gonna say next.

1014
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:23,108
<i>I mean, I think I know.</i>

1015
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,442
I'm not sure...

1016
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:28,209
<i>but I think so.</i>

1017
01:21:28,249 --> 01:21:30,513
There's no need for me to bring
anything dressy?

1018
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,111
<i>I didn't know...</i>

1019
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:36,623
if we were eating in any restaurants
that have dress codes.

1020
01:21:38,259 --> 01:21:41,626
Well, I don't...

1021
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,789
<i>I mean, maybe.</i>

1022
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,231
I mean, yes! Let's.

1023
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,195
Gotcha.

1024
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,333
- What did you think I was gonna ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

1025
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,472
Okay, then. Good night.

1026
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:08,255
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1027
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,889
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

1028
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:16,294
Put him in with that one, not that one.
Builds his confidence.

1029
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,223
Lip kiss.

1030
01:22:22,937 --> 01:22:25,531
I love you.
I'll miss you.

1031
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,701
Hey! Real sensitive!

1032
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,536
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

1033
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,481
Don't worry, Mom!
Have a good time!

1034
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:46,288
- Don't run.
- Have fun! Don't worry!

1035
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:50,627
- Have fun, but don't run.
- Grandma will take care of me! Bye!

1036
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:58,530
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you myself.
- So am I, Frank.

1037
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,540
Give me a hug.

1038
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,274
- Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

1039
01:23:05,346 --> 01:23:06,836
Soak it up.

1040
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,175
It's your last chance for a hug
for a few days.

1041
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,469
Thank you for being on time.

1042
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,803
Carol the waitress.
Simon the fag.

1043
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:42,212
Hello.
Holy God! Who did that to you?

1044
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,711
Um, I was attacked.

1045
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,314
I walked in on some men robbing me...

1046
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:53,350
and I was hospitalized.

1047
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,627
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

1048
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,634
Let's go.

1049
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:04,931
How are you, sir?
Oh, I was gonna do that for you.

1050
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,270
It's all right.
Where should we sit?

1051
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:10,539
I, uh... Well, there's
no place cards or anything.

1052
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:14,981
You look like you need more room,
so I'll sit in the back.

1053
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:33,367
Never a break. Never.

1054
01:24:33,434 --> 01:24:36,403
Thank you for the seat.
That was very thoughtful.

1055
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:41,001
- You look like you're crowded in there.
- It's all right.

1056
01:24:43,911 --> 01:24:45,435
Thanks.

1057
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,322
Thank you.

1058
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,726
You're welcome.

1059
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,725
I've got the whole trip programmed.

1060
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:14,775
I'm just kidding.
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1061
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:18,672
Seriously.

1062
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:21,443
We got good stuff here.

1063
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:36,892
<i>When it's not always raining</i>
<i>There'll be days like this</i>

1064
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,729
- <i>When there's no complaining</i>
- I like this music.

1065
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,928
<i>There'll be days like this</i>

1066
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,631
I like this music.

1067
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:47,436
<i>Like the flick of a switch</i>

1068
01:25:47,508 --> 01:25:49,942
<i>Well, my mama told me</i>

1069
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,412
<i>There'll be days like this</i>

1070
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:58,976
<i>Well, I'm looking for my girl</i>
<i>I wonder where can she be</i>

1071
01:25:59,053 --> 01:26:03,353
Simon, I'm sure they did something
really off for you to feel this way...

1072
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:06,724
but when it comes to your parents
or your kid...

1073
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:11,288
something will always be off for you
unless you set it straight.

1074
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:15,996
And maybe this thing happened to you
just to give you a chance to do that.

1075
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:19,005
Nonsense.
And you want to know why?

1076
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,008
Anybody here who's interested in what
Melvin has to say, raise their hand.

1077
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,620
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?

1078
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,452
Yes.

1079
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,322
- When I was a kid...
- No, wait.

1080
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:42,090
I'm gonna pull over,
give you my full attention.

1081
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:50,931
Well, I always painted,
and my mother always encouraged it.

1082
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:55,101
I mean, she was really
sort of fabulous about it, actually.

1083
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:58,403
And she used to...

1084
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:02,006
I was too young to think
that there was anything wrong with it.

1085
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:07,453
She was very natural,
so she used to pose nude for me.

1086
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:11,587
And I always thought,
or I guess I assumed...

1087
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:13,718
that my father knew about it.

1088
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:15,626
This stuff is pointless.

1089
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:19,360
- Hey, let him finish...
- You like sad stories? Wanna hear mine?

1090
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,560
Stop.

1091
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:27,471
Go ahead, really.
Please don't let him stop you.

1092
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:34,973
One day he walked in and found us,
and he started screaming.

1093
01:27:35,049 --> 01:27:37,847
My father didn't come out of his room
for 11 years.

1094
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,911
He used to hit me on the hands
with a yardstick if I made a mistake...

1095
01:27:40,988 --> 01:27:42,888
playing the piano.

1096
01:27:46,994 --> 01:27:48,518
Go ahead, Simon.

1097
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:52,032
So you said he came in your room
and he was yelling?

1098
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,796
- Uh-huh.
- Please, come on.

1099
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:59,873
- He was, um...
- Come on.

1100
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:02,808
Yeah, I know. I was...

1101
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:05,402
I remember I was defending
my mother...

1102
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,971
and I was trying to, you know...

1103
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:11,382
make peace in the lamest way.

1104
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,886
I said...

1105
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,515
"She's not naked. It's art."

1106
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,118
He started hitting me...

1107
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:26,598
and he beat me unconscious.

1108
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:29,898
And he talked to me
less and less after that.

1109
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:33,099
I mean, he knew what I was
before I did.

1110
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:36,803
And the morning
that I left for college...

1111
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,812
he walked into my room...

1112
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,849
and he held out his hand...

1113
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:44,681
and it was filled with money.

1114
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:50,187
A big, sweaty wad of money.

1115
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:56,060
And he said, "I don't want you
to ever come back."

1116
01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:01,726
And I just grabbed him
and I hugged him...

1117
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,465
and he turned and walked out.

1118
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:20,016
We all have these terrible stories
to get over, and you...

1119
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:21,681
That's not true.

1120
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:24,554
Some of us have great stories,
pretty stories...

1121
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,718
that take place at lakes...

1122
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:30,730
with boats and friends
and noodle salad.

1123
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:32,733
Just no one in this car.

1124
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:34,462
But a lot of people...

1125
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:38,266
that's their story:
Good times, noodle salad.

1126
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:42,500
What makes it so hard
is not that you had it bad...

1127
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:46,138
but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

1128
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:50,617
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1129
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:53,610
Not it at all, huh?

1130
01:29:57,592 --> 01:30:01,255
Let's go to the hotel.

1131
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:04,025
Tomorrow you'll see if you can get
another big wad...

1132
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:06,293
of sweaty money out of his hand.

1133
01:30:15,776 --> 01:30:18,210
Can I ask you a personal question?

1134
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:22,809
Sure.

1135
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:26,119
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

1136
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:33,258
I mean, wouldn't your life
be easier if you weren't...

1137
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:35,557
You consider your life easy?

1138
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:40,533
All right.
I give you that one.

1139
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:45,662
Nice packin'.

1140
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,710
- Hey, Spence.
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1141
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:01,181
- <i>Wait till you hear.</i>
- Why are you out of breath?

1142
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:04,315
<i>Mom, I ran over a guy</i>
<i>and scored a goal.</i>

1143
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:08,351
- You did?
- <i>Yeah. He was big. Charlie. You know.</i>

1144
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,894
That's great!

1145
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:13,934
- <i>Yep. Amazing.</i>
- Oh, my God, right?

1146
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:16,731
<i>Mom, we're playing again.</i>
<i>Gotta go. Bye.</i>

1147
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,829
Wait. Just tell me...

1148
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:24,875
- <i>He scored a goal.</i>
- Mom, I don't believe it.

1149
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:27,073
- Oh, you would've died.
- <i>Oh, my God.!</i>

1150
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,887
My son was outside playing soccer.
Come on.

1151
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:37,083
Take me out for a good time.
Take me out dancing.

1152
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,250
Dancing?

1153
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,022
I can't. I'm exhausted.

1154
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:44,963
Oh, come on. Please, come on.

1155
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:48,959
All right.

1156
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:51,163
You're right.

1157
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:56,175
- Are you sad or something?
- No, I'm nervous.

1158
01:31:56,243 --> 01:32:00,111
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

1159
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,978
What a nice compliment.

1160
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,355
I'm happy.

1161
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:20,124
And you're my date.

1162
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:23,369
Let's get dressed.

1163
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:35,112
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Okay.

1164
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:37,742
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1165
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:18,352
- All set?
- Yeah.

1166
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:25,058
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1167
01:33:25,132 --> 01:33:27,965
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1168
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:39,471
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1169
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,939
Thank you.

1170
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:44,712
Good evening.

1171
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:47,913
- Hi. You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1172
01:33:47,988 --> 01:33:51,253
Just him. Okay, you can answer.
We worked it out.

1173
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:52,849
Yes, we do.

1174
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:55,953
Oh, and I can give you
a tie and jacket.

1175
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,999
- What?
- They require a tie and jacket.

1176
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:00,397
We have some available.

1177
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:16,349
No, I'm not putting that on.

1178
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:21,447
I'm also not going to let you inject me
with the plague, either.

1179
01:34:21,522 --> 01:34:23,922
It's such a nice place.

1180
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:26,391
You probably have these dry cleaned
all the time, don't you?

1181
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,325
Actually, I don't think so.

1182
01:34:36,403 --> 01:34:40,396
Well, you just wait here.

1183
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:43,307
Excuse me.

1184
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,257
Good evening.

1185
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:02,185
- I need a coat and tie.
- Well, come on in.

1186
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:09,395
- Uh, that one.
- This one?

1187
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:12,234
That one, yeah.
And this tie.

1188
01:35:21,515 --> 01:35:23,244
Excuse me.

1189
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:31,090
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

1190
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:34,889
- Thanks.
- Should I get her for you?

1191
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:38,125
No, that's all right.
I'll just watch.

1192
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:47,635
- Can I buy you another drink?
- This is plenty. No, thank you.

1193
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:33,180
Oh. Wait.

1194
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:06,619
You look so se...

1195
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:11,182
You look, uh, great.

1196
01:37:13,527 --> 01:37:15,051
You look great.

1197
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:27,030
You want to dance?

1198
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:32,010
Well, I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

1199
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:34,104
- And?
- No.

1200
01:37:36,383 --> 01:37:38,943
I don't get this place.

1201
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:43,748
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

1202
01:37:44,758 --> 01:37:46,453
I don't get it.

1203
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:50,122
What? No. Wait. Why?

1204
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:53,223
Where are you goin'? Why?

1205
01:37:56,270 --> 01:38:00,036
I didn't mean it that way.
You ought to sit down.

1206
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:03,237
You can still give me the dirty look.
Just sit down and give it to me.

1207
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:05,505
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1208
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:08,639
I need one. Quick.

1209
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:12,243
You have no idea how much
what you just said hurt my feelings.

1210
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:15,585
The mono-minute someone gets
that they need you...

1211
01:38:15,622 --> 01:38:17,749
they threaten to walk out.

1212
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:21,052
A compliment is something nice
about somebody else.

1213
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:26,395
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1214
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,100
And mean it.

1215
01:38:48,822 --> 01:38:50,312
Can we order first?

1216
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:00,699
Two hard-shell crab dinners!

1217
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,531
Pitcher of ice-cold beer!

1218
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,468
Baked or fries?

1219
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:06,029
Fries.

1220
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,608
One baked, one fried.

1221
01:39:12,679 --> 01:39:15,409
I'll tell your waiter.

1222
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:17,347
My waiter.

1223
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:22,845
Okay, now, I got a real great
compliment for you...

1224
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,183
and it's true.

1225
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:27,352
I'm so afraid you're about
to say something awful.

1226
01:39:28,429 --> 01:39:31,057
Don't be pessimistic.
It's not your style.

1227
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:34,700
Okay, here I go.

1228
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:38,363
Clearly a mistake.

1229
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:44,474
I've got this, what, ailment?

1230
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:52,144
My doctor, a shrink that
I used to go to all the time...

1231
01:39:52,219 --> 01:39:54,847
says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases...

1232
01:39:54,888 --> 01:39:57,379
a pill really helps.

1233
01:39:58,459 --> 01:39:59,824
I hate pills.

1234
01:39:59,893 --> 01:40:02,259
Very dangerous thing, pills.

1235
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:07,164
I'm using the word "hate" here
about pills.

1236
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:10,203
My compliment is, that night...

1237
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:13,638
when you came over and told me
that you would never...

1238
01:40:15,309 --> 01:40:19,507
All right, well, you were there.
You know what you said.

1239
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:22,174
Well, my compliment to you is...

1240
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:27,910
the next morning
I started taking the pills.

1241
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:34,388
I don't quite get
how that's a compliment for me.

1242
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:42,561
You make me want to be a better man.

1243
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:58,542
That's maybe the best compliment
of my life.

1244
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,749
Well, maybe I overshot a little.

1245
01:41:05,792 --> 01:41:08,761
I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out.

1246
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:23,276
How's it goin' with those pills?

1247
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:27,441
Good, I hope, I hope...

1248
01:41:32,986 --> 01:41:34,476
It's little by little.

1249
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:40,659
It's exhausting talking like this.

1250
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:04,647
Do you ever let a romantic moment make
you do something you know is stupid?

1251
01:42:06,253 --> 01:42:07,311
Never.

1252
01:42:08,755 --> 01:42:11,451
Here's the trouble with "never."

1253
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:36,878
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

1254
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:42,354
When you first came in to breakfast,
when I first saw you...

1255
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:43,822
I thought you were handsome.

1256
01:42:45,892 --> 01:42:47,860
Then, of course, you spoke.

1257
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:54,489
So now that your...

1258
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:56,763
soft little underbelly
is all exposed...

1259
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,897
tell me, why did you
bring me here?

1260
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,845
It's...

1261
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,753
a personal question.

1262
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:17,279
- Tell me, even if you're scared.
- Scared?

1263
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:19,587
Tell me why you wanted me here.

1264
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:23,028
It's okay.

1265
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:26,031
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1266
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:29,834
Well, l...

1267
01:43:29,903 --> 01:43:33,703
I don't know.

1268
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:36,504
There's a lot of reasons.

1269
01:43:36,576 --> 01:43:39,909
I thought... one thought...
maybe if you had sex with Simon...

1270
01:43:39,946 --> 01:43:41,675
What?

1271
01:43:43,817 --> 01:43:46,547
Well, that's just one idea.

1272
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,485
That's why you brought me?

1273
01:43:48,555 --> 01:43:51,388
Like I'm a what...

1274
01:43:51,425 --> 01:43:54,019
and I owe you what?

1275
01:43:54,094 --> 01:43:56,619
I don't know why I brought you.

1276
01:43:56,663 --> 01:44:01,123
That was just one thought that I had.
It came out first. That's all it was.

1277
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:03,632
I thought, you kiss him, me.

1278
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:06,639
When you two seemed to hit it off...

1279
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:08,868
No, wait. That's... I didn't mean...

1280
01:44:08,942 --> 01:44:11,137
Forget what I said about Simon.

1281
01:44:11,378 --> 01:44:14,142
- I'll never forget you said it.
- It's a mistake.

1282
01:44:15,949 --> 01:44:17,610
It was a mistake.

1283
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:26,492
- <i>Hello, this is Fred Bishop.</i>
- <i>And Betty.</i>

1284
01:44:26,526 --> 01:44:28,756
<i>We're sorry to be unable</i>
<i>to take your call right now.</i>

1285
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:31,127
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>with all the pertinent information.</i>

1286
01:44:31,164 --> 01:44:32,961
- <i>Say good-bye.</i>
- <i>Good-bye.</i>

1287
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:34,796
<i>Thank you.</i>

1288
01:44:34,868 --> 01:44:36,836
It's Simon.

1289
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:40,406
I'm in town.

1290
01:44:45,512 --> 01:44:48,640
Folks, you haven't been out later
that 10:00 in your entire lives.

1291
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:51,013
Please pick up the phone.

1292
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,985
Really.

1293
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,851
I'll try you in the morning.

1294
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:04,158
I need to see you...

1295
01:45:04,398 --> 01:45:07,629
or at least get you
to answer the phone.

1296
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:19,010
How are you?

1297
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:21,513
- Is this gonna be your room?
- Our room.

1298
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:24,642
I don't wanna see him,
and he's not gonna knock on your door.

1299
01:45:24,718 --> 01:45:25,776
What happened?

1300
01:45:26,953 --> 01:45:28,887
Don't ask.

1301
01:45:31,525 --> 01:45:34,494
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1302
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:36,791
- Do you need help...
- No!

1303
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:42,196
I'm taking a big bath
and ordering a big meal.

1304
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:43,596
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1305
01:45:45,906 --> 01:45:49,239
I'm tired of my own complaints.
I gotta get some new thoughts.

1306
01:45:49,443 --> 01:45:50,967
What are you thinking about?

1307
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:53,876
How to die, mostly.

1308
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:59,146
Can you believe, in our little mix,
you're the good roommate?

1309
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,266
- Good night.
- Good night.

1310
01:46:58,111 --> 01:47:00,045
Hold it.

1311
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:23,093
- I have to draw you.
- Huh?

1312
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:26,836
I have to draw you.

1313
01:47:28,975 --> 01:47:31,603
Absolutely not. I'm a lot
more shy than people think.

1314
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:33,703
- I give off the wrong impression.
- I have to.

1315
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,680
I haven't sketched anything
in weeks.

1316
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:38,343
Stop staring.
Do a vase.

1317
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:40,844
But you're beautiful.

1318
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:43,788
Your skin, your long neck...

1319
01:47:45,158 --> 01:47:47,922
the back, the line of you.

1320
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:52,931
You're why cavemen
chiseled on walls.

1321
01:47:56,603 --> 01:47:58,002
All right. Cut me a break.

1322
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:23,652
<i>The next thing I know she's...</i>

1323
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:26,858
sitting right there next to me.

1324
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:29,663
Well, it's not right
to go into details.

1325
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:32,170
I got nervous.

1326
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:34,968
I screwed up.
I said the wrong thing.

1327
01:48:38,645 --> 01:48:40,670
Where if I hadn't...

1328
01:48:40,714 --> 01:48:44,081
I could be in bed right now
with a woman...

1329
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:48,951
who if you make her laugh,
you got a life.

1330
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:54,326
Instead, I'm here with you.

1331
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:58,057
No offense, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

1332
01:49:03,036 --> 01:49:04,970
Jameson, soda back.

1333
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,772
I'm sorry.
I don't care how you put this.

1334
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:13,870
- We're being naughty here, pal.
- No.

1335
01:49:13,947 --> 01:49:17,075
This is great.
This is so great.

1336
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:20,244
I swear to God,
my hand won't even keep up.

1337
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,720
- Hold it.
- I'm just turning.

1338
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:25,417
- Then hold that. Hold any of them.
- Okay. This?

1339
01:49:25,659 --> 01:49:29,288
It doesn't matter.
My hand's not even bothering me.

1340
01:49:29,362 --> 01:49:32,354
I can't... I just...

1341
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:35,424
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

1342
01:49:39,839 --> 01:49:41,773
Oh, careful.

1343
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:55,915
Coming in. It's late.

1344
01:50:02,395 --> 01:50:04,124
Did you have sex with her?

1345
01:50:05,031 --> 01:50:06,999
You're sure you
don't want your shampoos?

1346
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,505
Sorry.

1347
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:17,835
I didn't know
she was still here.

1348
01:50:17,911 --> 01:50:20,937
- Did you have sex with her?
- To hell with sex.

1349
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:23,414
It was better than sex.
We held each other.

1350
01:50:25,018 --> 01:50:28,385
What I need
he gave me great.

1351
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:31,447
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1352
01:50:36,362 --> 01:50:38,330
I just love her.

1353
01:50:44,437 --> 01:50:46,371
How are you doin'?

1354
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:04,848
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom? Hi.

1355
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:08,349
<i>Hello, Simon. You were right.</i>
<i>We were home last night.</i>

1356
01:51:08,428 --> 01:51:10,453
Do you have to whisper?
I can barely hear you.

1357
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:13,260
- <i>I'm not a screamer.</i>
- No, no.

1358
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:16,063
It was the luckiest thing
you didn't answer last night.

1359
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:18,229
- <i>Your father hasn't been feeling well.</i>
- I can't hear you.

1360
01:51:18,304 --> 01:51:21,205
- <i>It's too late to start. Hold on.</i>
- Hold for what?

1361
01:51:21,274 --> 01:51:23,572
What are you gonna do?
Where are you going?

1362
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:26,574
I get why you're angry with me,
but it's no snap to...

1363
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:29,772
- He's talking to his parents.
- Then you listen to me.

1364
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:32,943
Truly no grudges, okay?
Truly.

1365
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:37,251
It was odd that you didn't come see me
when you heard I was hurt, but...

1366
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:40,817
- <i>We almost did.</i>
- I don't even want to talk about it.

1367
01:51:40,894 --> 01:51:43,920
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

1368
01:51:43,997 --> 01:51:47,057
- <i>You do sound different.</i>
- Yes, I'm working again.

1369
01:51:47,133 --> 01:51:50,398
- <i>Good. About money</i>...
- I don't need anything.

1370
01:51:50,436 --> 01:51:53,030
I'll drop you a line
from wherever I land.

1371
01:51:53,106 --> 01:51:56,098
Then it's up to you to make
the next move, and I hope you do.

1372
01:51:56,176 --> 01:51:58,201
He's gonna want to stay.

1373
01:51:58,278 --> 01:52:01,941
They'll want to take a ride
to the lake or whatever.

1374
01:52:02,015 --> 01:52:05,041
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- <i>Bye, dear.</i>

1375
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,110
- He's gonna feel stirred up.
- Bye, Mom.

1376
01:52:08,188 --> 01:52:10,452
We'll probably have
a good five-hour drive.

1377
01:52:10,523 --> 01:52:13,253
- It'll give us a chance to relax...
- So?

1378
01:52:13,326 --> 01:52:15,886
- And be together alone.
- I'm coming with you.

1379
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:19,822
- What about your parents?
- No, I'll take care of myself.

1380
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:23,528
What are you talking about?
You got real problems.

1381
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:27,928
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1382
01:52:27,974 --> 01:52:31,842
Suddenly everything
seems so easy.

1383
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:35,005
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1384
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:40,951
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1385
01:52:42,488 --> 01:52:46,857
- Ah, geez. No choice.
- I got a gift for you.

1386
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:50,487
Nothing like no choice
to make you feel at home.

1387
01:52:50,563 --> 01:52:52,895
Let me see.

1388
01:52:52,966 --> 01:52:55,332
Ah. Gorgeous.

1389
01:52:55,368 --> 01:53:00,305
Do it then, and pick up the dog.
I can't believe you let it stay there.

1390
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,864
Good-bye.

1391
01:53:03,343 --> 01:53:05,573
Your luck's running.

1392
01:53:05,645 --> 01:53:09,308
They sublet your place.
You're homeless.

1393
01:53:11,317 --> 01:53:14,616
Frank's got a line on another place
you can use for now.

1394
01:53:14,687 --> 01:53:18,282
- Another place where?
- Does it matter?

1395
01:53:22,996 --> 01:53:25,123
It doesn't.

1396
01:53:26,032 --> 01:53:28,364
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1397
01:53:30,336 --> 01:53:32,031
I'm sorry.

1398
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:59,056
<i>I love you</i>

1399
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:04,329
<i>For sentimental reasons</i>

1400
01:54:04,404 --> 01:54:07,032
I don't want to hear
that music right now.

1401
01:54:07,073 --> 01:54:10,065
- You said you liked it.
- I don't.

1402
01:54:12,412 --> 01:54:15,745
- This one has a meaning.
- It's your call...

1403
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:18,746
but I don't want to hear it,
if that means anything.

1404
01:54:38,538 --> 01:54:40,972
Yes, sir. All right.

1405
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:45,238
Here's the keys
to my apartment.

1406
01:54:45,311 --> 01:54:49,611
You go up there and wait.
I'm gonna take Carol home.

1407
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:53,143
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

1408
01:54:59,659 --> 01:55:02,355
Can you come here?

1409
01:55:02,428 --> 01:55:05,363
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1410
01:55:06,632 --> 01:55:09,192
I don't think
I want to know you anymore.

1411
01:55:09,268 --> 01:55:11,998
All you do is make me
feel bad about myself.

1412
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:17,443
You have my number.

1413
01:55:20,013 --> 01:55:22,072
Let him take you home.

1414
01:55:22,148 --> 01:55:24,116
I don't want to.

1415
01:55:25,184 --> 01:55:28,347
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1416
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:40,165
Don't say anything.

1417
01:55:43,169 --> 01:55:46,832
I gotta get ahold of Frank,
see where I'm hanging my hat.

1418
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,338
Well...

1419
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:52,173
I think you're gonna
have to camp it here.

1420
01:55:52,245 --> 01:55:55,305
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, look! There's Verdell!

1421
01:55:55,348 --> 01:55:56,645
Look at you!

1422
01:55:56,682 --> 01:55:58,741
- Come here.
- Look at you.

1423
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:07,419
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1424
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:12,821
Sorry.
You're just fun to mess with.

1425
01:56:15,401 --> 01:56:20,498
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie brought your personal things.

1426
01:56:20,573 --> 01:56:24,100
They were gonna set you up in here.
It's an extra room.

1427
01:56:24,177 --> 01:56:26,111
I never use it.

1428
01:56:26,179 --> 01:56:29,171
It's got good light.
No other choice, really.

1429
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:31,182
I'm coming.

1430
01:56:33,386 --> 01:56:37,789
It's nice.

1431
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:40,087
It looks good.

1432
01:56:41,394 --> 01:56:44,363
They got your music...

1433
01:56:44,397 --> 01:56:46,865
paintings, paints.

1434
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,261
Have to say
they did a good job.

1435
01:56:52,538 --> 01:56:55,200
Well, it's gonna be okay, huh?

1436
01:56:55,241 --> 01:56:58,233
- Cozy, huh?
- Yeah.

1437
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:04,908
Thank you.

1438
01:57:07,286 --> 01:57:08,685
You overwhelm me.

1439
01:57:15,761 --> 01:57:17,251
I love you.

1440
01:57:23,769 --> 01:57:26,260
I tell you, buddy.

1441
01:57:26,339 --> 01:57:29,706
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1442
01:57:42,622 --> 01:57:44,783
Make yourself at home.

1443
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:50,459
<i>Anything else in the bag?</i>

1444
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:54,227
- I played soccer while you were away.
- Yeah, I know.

1445
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:57,667
I love my cookbook.

1446
01:57:57,737 --> 01:58:01,195
It's great. It's got all
these wonderful recipes in here.

1447
01:58:01,274 --> 01:58:04,710
It says something for shark.
I never fixed shark before.

1448
01:58:04,777 --> 01:58:08,304
"Shark With A Bite."
Would you like that, Spencer?

1449
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:11,407
There's some cookies here
called "Wasps' Nest."

1450
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:18,283
Where is my big, hairy boy?

1451
01:58:18,324 --> 01:58:20,758
Where is he?

1452
01:58:20,793 --> 01:58:24,285
Where is my beautiful boy?
Sweetheart.

1453
01:58:25,631 --> 01:58:27,826
Oh, you're in bed.

1454
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,697
Oh, no.

1455
01:58:30,703 --> 01:58:32,432
Yeah.

1456
01:58:34,407 --> 01:58:38,673
I just didn't think Verdell
should get too comfortable...

1457
01:58:38,711 --> 01:58:40,645
- sleeping in here.
- Look.

1458
01:58:40,713 --> 01:58:43,341
- It's not gonna...
- The dog's already comfortable.

1459
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,582
Is this okay?

1460
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:55,257
It's me. Hi!

1461
01:58:55,328 --> 01:58:56,955
Yes.

1462
01:58:57,029 --> 01:59:00,795
He took me in. Yes.
It's Carol for you.

1463
01:59:00,833 --> 01:59:03,996
I practically fainted
when I walked in.

1464
01:59:04,237 --> 01:59:06,330
- Take the dog.
- I gotta go.

1465
01:59:06,372 --> 01:59:10,468
- Just take the dog.
- Oh, come here.

1466
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:14,309
Come on. Move faster.

1467
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:18,373
- Don't limp. Move fast.
- Good luck.

1468
01:59:32,365 --> 01:59:35,459
- Yeah.
- <i>How are you doing?</i>

1469
01:59:35,534 --> 01:59:39,994
- Not so hot.
- <i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

1470
01:59:40,039 --> 01:59:43,372
I don't know whether I'm
being sensible or hard on you.

1471
01:59:43,409 --> 01:59:45,502
<i>Maybe both. Maybe.</i>

1472
01:59:45,578 --> 01:59:49,674
See, right there, I don't know
whether you're being cute or crazy.

1473
01:59:49,749 --> 01:59:52,843
- Cute.
- Don't answer everything I say.

1474
01:59:52,918 --> 01:59:56,445
Just listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

1475
01:59:57,857 --> 02:00:02,055
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1476
02:00:02,295 --> 02:00:05,355
And what I said on the street...

1477
02:00:05,431 --> 02:00:07,763
that was a bad thing to say.

1478
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:12,066
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1479
02:00:14,707 --> 02:00:19,474
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1480
02:00:20,946 --> 02:00:24,313
But the truth is,
you do bother me enormously.

1481
02:00:24,383 --> 02:00:26,874
And I know that it...

1482
02:00:26,952 --> 02:00:29,716
I think that it's better for me
to not have contact with you...

1483
02:00:29,789 --> 02:00:31,484
because you're not ready...

1484
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:33,752
and you're a pretty old guy
to not be ready...

1485
02:00:33,793 --> 02:00:36,489
and I'm too old to ignore that.

1486
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:39,793
But there were
extraordinary kindnesses...

1487
02:00:39,832 --> 02:00:41,766
that did take place.

1488
02:00:49,775 --> 02:00:51,436
Anyway, thanks for the trip.

1489
02:00:53,846 --> 02:00:56,440
Good night.

1490
02:00:56,515 --> 02:00:58,142
Okay if I say something now?

1491
02:01:03,456 --> 02:01:04,514
Go ahead.

1492
02:01:07,026 --> 02:01:09,119
I should have danced with you.

1493
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:16,100
Good night.

1494
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:41,091
- Are you gonna talk to me or not?
- I'm coming.

1495
02:01:52,471 --> 02:01:55,770
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1496
02:01:55,841 --> 02:01:57,570
Extraordinary.

1497
02:01:57,643 --> 02:02:00,942
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1498
02:02:02,948 --> 02:02:04,882
I'm dying here.

1499
02:02:07,086 --> 02:02:09,486
Because...

1500
02:02:09,555 --> 02:02:11,614
you love her.

1501
02:02:13,192 --> 02:02:16,650
And you people are supposed
to be sensitive and sharp?

1502
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:19,698
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's "dying here."

1503
02:02:21,033 --> 02:02:22,125
I don't know.

1504
02:02:22,201 --> 02:02:24,999
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1505
02:02:25,070 --> 02:02:28,528
- I'll figure it out.
- Oh, please.

1506
02:02:30,676 --> 02:02:33,167
I'm stuck.

1507
02:02:33,245 --> 02:02:36,681
I can't get back
to my old life.

1508
02:02:38,884 --> 02:02:41,011
She's evicted me from my life.

1509
02:02:41,086 --> 02:02:43,054
Did you really like it that much?

1510
02:02:43,088 --> 02:02:45,818
Well, it's better than this.

1511
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:48,758
Look, you,
I'm very intelligent.

1512
02:02:48,794 --> 02:02:51,763
If you're gonna give me hope,
you gotta do better than you're doing.

1513
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:55,858
If you can't be at least mildly
interesting, then shut the hell up.

1514
02:02:55,935 --> 02:03:00,031
I'm drowning here,
and you're describing the water!

1515
02:03:00,072 --> 02:03:01,699
Picking on me won't help.

1516
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:06,610
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1517
02:03:09,949 --> 02:03:12,577
Melvin, do you know
where you're lucky?

1518
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:18,751
You know who you want.

1519
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:24,052
I would take your seat
any day.

1520
02:03:24,129 --> 02:03:26,256
So do something about it.

1521
02:03:26,499 --> 02:03:29,059
Go over there now, tonight.
Don't sleep on it.

1522
02:03:29,134 --> 02:03:32,695
It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1523
02:03:32,771 --> 02:03:35,672
You can do this, Melvin.
You can do this.

1524
02:03:35,741 --> 02:03:39,074
Pull the stops.
Tell her how you feel.

1525
02:03:39,144 --> 02:03:42,944
- You can do this.
- Hey, I'm charged here.

1526
02:03:42,982 --> 02:03:46,315
- Yes, you are.
- She might kill me if I go over.

1527
02:03:46,519 --> 02:03:49,283
Then get in your jammies
and I'll read you a story.

1528
02:03:49,522 --> 02:03:51,547
I really think
you have a chance here.

1529
02:03:51,624 --> 02:03:55,321
The best thing you have going for you
is a willingness to humiliate yourself.

1530
02:03:55,561 --> 02:03:58,894
So go over there, do this.
Catch her off guard.

1531
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:06,333
- Okay.
- Okay.

1532
02:04:08,941 --> 02:04:11,307
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1533
02:04:13,312 --> 02:04:15,246
Here I go.

1534
02:04:24,123 --> 02:04:25,920
What's wrong?

1535
02:04:29,562 --> 02:04:31,120
I forgot to lock the door.

1536
02:05:50,275 --> 02:05:52,243
What do you want, Melvin?

1537
02:05:53,345 --> 02:05:56,371
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep.

1538
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:03,151
What a break.

1539
02:06:05,324 --> 02:06:08,191
Is it a secret
what you're doing here?

1540
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,095
I had to see you.

1541
02:06:17,302 --> 02:06:18,360
Because?

1542
02:06:22,041 --> 02:06:24,839
It relaxes me.

1543
02:06:26,478 --> 02:06:30,778
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb...

1544
02:06:30,849 --> 02:06:32,077
than any other place...

1545
02:06:32,117 --> 02:06:35,416
I can think of or imagine.

1546
02:06:35,487 --> 02:06:38,251
No, wait.
That's overstating.

1547
02:06:38,323 --> 02:06:42,054
I'd rather be sitting inside
on the steps...

1548
02:06:42,127 --> 02:06:44,288
'cause I don't want to
get my feet in the gutter.

1549
02:06:44,329 --> 02:06:45,956
- What would that serve?
- Stop it!

1550
02:06:46,031 --> 02:06:49,694
Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1551
02:06:49,768 --> 02:06:53,295
Just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1552
02:06:53,372 --> 02:06:57,433
Everybody wants that, dear.
It doesn't exist.

1553
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:03,839
Oh, I'm sorry.

1554
02:07:03,916 --> 02:07:06,851
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1555
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:13,883
Boyfriend.

1556
02:07:18,163 --> 02:07:22,429
Come on in and try not
to ruin everything by being you.

1557
02:07:23,869 --> 02:07:26,770
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks.

1558
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:33,244
Maybe we could.

1559
02:07:59,505 --> 02:08:03,032
It feels a little confined in here.

1560
02:08:03,075 --> 02:08:05,168
Let's take a walk.

1561
02:08:08,013 --> 02:08:10,447
See, it's 4:00 in the morning.

1562
02:08:10,516 --> 02:08:14,145
A walk sounds
a little screwy to me...

1563
02:08:14,219 --> 02:08:15,777
if you don't mind.

1564
02:08:15,854 --> 02:08:20,223
Well, if you need an excuse...

1565
02:08:20,259 --> 02:08:24,059
there's a bakery on the corner
that will be open soon.

1566
02:08:24,129 --> 02:08:26,529
That way we're not screwy.

1567
02:08:26,598 --> 02:08:30,557
Just two people
that like warm rolls.

1568
02:08:34,973 --> 02:08:36,338
Okay.

1569
02:08:54,827 --> 02:08:57,125
What are you doing?

1570
02:08:57,162 --> 02:09:00,097
I still want you to hear
part of that car song.

1571
02:09:00,165 --> 02:09:02,099
You don't have to...

1572
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:11,006
<i>And darlin'</i>

1573
02:09:11,076 --> 02:09:14,136
<i>I'm never lonely</i>

1574
02:09:14,213 --> 02:09:18,206
<i>Whenever you're in sight</i>

1575
02:09:18,283 --> 02:09:20,217
Thank you.

1576
02:09:21,587 --> 02:09:23,521
You know, I was hoping...

1577
02:09:38,503 --> 02:09:42,906
I'm sorry. Whatever this is
is not gonna work.

1578
02:09:52,184 --> 02:09:54,982
- I'm feel...
- What?

1579
02:09:57,022 --> 02:09:59,388
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1580
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:04,254
Even though
it may seem that way now...

1581
02:10:04,329 --> 02:10:07,389
you don't know me all that well.

1582
02:10:07,466 --> 02:10:09,024
I'm not the answer for you.

1583
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:12,696
Hey, I've got
a great compliment for you.

1584
02:10:14,339 --> 02:10:17,570
- You know what?
- Just let me...

1585
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:19,577
Let me talk.

1586
02:10:25,584 --> 02:10:29,384
I might be the only person
on the face of the Earth...

1587
02:10:29,421 --> 02:10:32,015
that knows you're
the greatest woman on Earth.

1588
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:36,049
I might be the only one
who appreciates...

1589
02:10:36,094 --> 02:10:40,622
how amazing you are in every
single thing that you do...

1590
02:10:40,699 --> 02:10:43,600
and how you are with Spencer.

1591
02:10:43,669 --> 02:10:45,034
Spence.

1592
02:10:46,204 --> 02:10:50,038
In every single thought you have
and how you say what you mean...

1593
02:10:50,108 --> 02:10:52,576
and how you almost always
mean something...

1594
02:10:52,644 --> 02:10:57,308
that's all about
being straight and good.

1595
02:10:59,718 --> 02:11:02,312
I think most people
miss that about you.

1596
02:11:02,387 --> 02:11:04,480
I wonder how they
can watch you...

1597
02:11:04,556 --> 02:11:07,548
bring their food
and clear their tables...

1598
02:11:07,592 --> 02:11:11,323
and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1599
02:11:12,464 --> 02:11:14,625
And the fact that I get it...

1600
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:16,634
makes me feel good...

1601
02:11:18,537 --> 02:11:20,129
about me.

1602
02:11:29,147 --> 02:11:31,775
Is that something that's...

1603
02:11:32,017 --> 02:11:34,383
bad for you to be around
for you?

1604
02:11:49,701 --> 02:11:51,066
I'm gonna grab ya.

1605
02:11:52,804 --> 02:11:55,671
I didn't mean for that
to be a question.

1606
02:11:55,741 --> 02:11:57,675
I'm gonna grab ya.

1607
02:12:21,299 --> 02:12:23,290
I know I can do better than that.

1608
02:12:47,559 --> 02:12:49,857
Better.
Definitely better.

1609
02:12:55,634 --> 02:12:56,726
See?

1610
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:17,254
Warm rolls.

1611
02:13:26,798 --> 02:13:28,732
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

1612
02:13:39,732 --> 02:13:44,732
