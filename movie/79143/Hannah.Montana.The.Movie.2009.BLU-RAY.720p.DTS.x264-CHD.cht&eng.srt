00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,431
他口中的"主題"就指"明星生活大曝光"
And by "feature" he means "career-ending expose. "

89
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,963
"鄉下女孩實現夢想 萬眾矚目" 我們能說的就這些
"Country girl living her dreams beloved by millions," that's all we got.

我要是全力出擊 可別怪我
Can't blame a bloke for trying.

92
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,515
憑什麼你一口咬定我們有瞞著什麼
How could you even think we have something to hide?

93
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,213
- 他沒看到什麼吧 對吧 - 我認為沒有
- He didn't see anything, did he? - I don't think so.

94

you can't talk to anyone unless I'm at your side.

96

I'm your publicist. You need to concentrate on what you do best

97
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,592
放開嗓子 大聲地唱
which is singing your scrappy little heart out.

98
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,494
剩下的我來操心
Let me worry about everything else,

99
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,592
比如 讓你的小秘密不公佈於眾
like making sure your little secret stays a secret.

100
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,035
有時候 我真希望可以 永遠成為漢娜
Sometimes I wish I could be Hannah all the time.

101
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,936
我和你都想 孩子

別擋路 狗仔們 一邊閃 讓我們過去
Out of the way, you jackals. Step aside. Coming through.

103
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,037
對了 別碰我們的巨星 靠邊站
That's right, don't touch the pop star. Move aside.

104
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:14,118
比如不讓你的小秘密公佈於眾
<i>...like making sure your little secret stays a secret.</i>

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,391
秘密? 什麼秘密 屁股挪開 你這頭母牛
Secret? What secret? Move your bum, you old cow.

106
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,792
說吧 奧奇 別讓我失望
Talk to me, Ozzie, and don't disappoint.

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,001
- 她似乎有一個秘密 - 好 正巧封面照定下來了
- Apparently there's a secret. - Good. Because the cover's ready.

108
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,236
我還需要一個故事
I just need the story to go with it.

109
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,873
挖出那個秘密 她可是全世界 青少年中最炙手可熱的明星
Find out that secret. She's the most popular teenager in the world.

110
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,078
我要你去給我找出 這個
<i>So I suggest you go out and find me every juicy,</i>

111
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:43,817
光彩照人的孟漢娜 有什麼見不得人的醜事
sordid detail of Hannah Montana's outrageous, glamorous life.

112
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,187
大家排好隊 我們要選新隊伍
All right. Line it up, people. We're going to choose new teams.

113
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,030
有人死在這了 幫一下?
Dead girl in the middle of the floor. Anybody?

114
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,534
勁爆消息：碧昂絲得了肺炎

Has to drop out of the New York Music Awards. You're in!

116
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,799
太棒了 不是說碧昂絲
That is great. Not for Beyonce.

117
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,107
我真應該致電慰問 但太棒了 我真激動
I really should call. But, yes! I'm so excited!

118
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,204
唱哪首歌? 穿什麼?
What am I gonna sing? What am I gonna wear?

119
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,977
問得好 車和化妝盒 已經在外面待命了
Great minds. The car and the box are already outside,

120
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,076
所以你要做的是去商場血拼
so Hannah has to do a major shop now.

121
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,519
最後機會 走吧
Last chance. Come on.

122
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,683

Minor Hannah emergency. I'll be there, I promise.

124
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,190
難道不過癮嗎?
Wasn't that fun?

125
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,100
但是白白拿東西走人很不習慣
Yeah, but it feels weird having them give me stuff for free.

126
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:34,402
拜託 知不知道一張你光臨本店 的照片值多少錢?
Please. Do you know what a well-placed photo of you shopping is worth?

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,237
你是一個明星 無敵偶像
You're a star, an icon.

128

你看過的 摸過的 穿過的 全世界的人都搶著要
You look at it, touch it, wear it, and the whole world has to have it.

129
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,773
是店老闆欠你的 想要什麼開口就是
They owe it to you, Hannah. Name it and it's yours.

130

167
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,592
是他
It's him.

168
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,124
奧斯瓦德 開快點
Oswald. Step on it!

但是也不能以漢娜的打扮 出現在麗莉的派對上
and I cannot show up at Lilly's party looking like Hannah.

171
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,247
看你往哪裡跑
Where are you headed?

謝謝 謝謝
Hi! Thank you. Thank you.

173
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,703
嘿 麗莉 怎麼了?
Hey, Lilly. What's up?

174
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,969
我們一直在幻想這個派對 從12歲開始 你在...
We've talked about this party since we were, like, 12. Where...

175
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,909
- 嗨 你好啊! 你在哪? - 快到了
- Hi! How are you? Where are you? - I'm almost there.

176
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,037
她掛我電話
She hung up on...

177
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,106
你在哪啊 大家都在等

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,015
- 對不起 打錯了! - 麥莉
- Sorry, wrong number! - Miley!

179
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,043
兩杯混合果露 麥莉在哪?沒看到她
Two smoothies, please. Where's Miley? We haven't seen her.

180
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,352
打過電話了 她說一會就到
Just spoke with her. She'll be here any second.

181
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,423
利克 蛋糕上的大洞是幹什麼的
Rico, what's this hole at the top of the cake?

182
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,832
上面有一個高壓電動螺旋圈
It's a high-pressure electro-pneumatic solenoid on it.

183
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:27,328
每平方英吋150磅衝擊力 帶有一個銅質安全閥
It's 150 pounds per square inch with a brass safety-check valve.

184
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,605
只要我按下按鈕 砰一聲 四處飛濺
Then I just hit this button and bam! Sparklers go off,

185
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,239
從蛋糕頂部就會有小旗子跳出來 上面寫著"生日快樂 麗莉"
and a "happy birthday, Lilly" banner shoots out the top of the cake.

186
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,114
又一次證明 利克是個天才
Once again... Rico is a genius.

187
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:54,255
打住 這是個私人聚會 只有嘉賓入內 聽到我說話了嗎
Hold it! This is a private event. Guests only! What did I tell you? Stop!

188
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,733
- 笑一個 - 不允許照相
- Smile. - No pictures.

189
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,731
這就是我命名的"麗莉式..."
That's what I call a Lilly... Wow.

190
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,573
是孟漢娜
It's Hannah Montana!

191
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,705

Is that Hannah Montana?

192
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,392
大伙 我只是來...
Guys, I'm only here... Wait!

193

Happy birthday to... I want to say happy birthday to my number one fan, Lilly.

194
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,596

She's over that way. She's over that way.

195
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,709
生日快樂 麗莉 生日快樂
Happy birthday, Lilly. Happy birthday.

196
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,271
對不起 我也沒辦法 我會補償你的 我發誓
I'm sorry. I had no choice. I'll make it up to you, I promise.

197
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,217
你不會 永遠不能補償我
You will never, ever, ever make it up to me.

198
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,313
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,386
唱 唱 唱 唱 唱
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.

200

<i>Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy.</i>

<i>Uh, you guys know the words to Let's Get Crazy?</i>

Hold up. Wait. Birthday Girl, I have some questions.

219
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,139
漢娜真的是43歲嗎? 她會對嘴嗎? 在納什維爾長大?
Is it true Hannah's really 43 years old? She lip syncs? Grew up in Nashville?

220
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,115
確切一點 應該是 克勞利坊的一片玉米地裡
More like a cornfield in some place called Crowley Corners.

221
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,174
是嗎?"Crowley"怎麼拼的
Really? How do you spell "Crowley"?

這難道不...可怕嗎 壞女孩漢娜
Isn't it... horrible. Bad Hannah.

234
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,362
我要和她好好談談
She and I need to have a little conversation.

235
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,737
現在? 可她要飛去紐約了
Now? But she's getting ready to go to New York.

236
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,402
她沒告訴你? 好機會來了
Didn't she tell you? There's an amazing opportunity.

237
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,901
我知道 收到了郵件通知 不許去
Yeah, I know about New York. I got CCed in an e-mail. Not happening.

238
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,143
她要和我去田納西州參加 她奶奶露比的生日聚會
She and I are flying to Tennessee for her Grandma Ruby's birthday.

239
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,242
她沒告訴你?
Didn't she tell you?

240
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,415
搶鞋大戰? 為一雙鞋大打出手?
A shoe fight! You got into a stinking shoe fight?

241
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,788
錯不在我 明明是我先看中的
In my defense, I totally saw those shoes first.

242
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:45,024
這是絕對的 無容置疑的 不可容忍的事情
This is absolutely, T-totally, without a doubt unacceptable.

243
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,931
正好用來形容你最近的行為
Which pretty much describes all of your behavior lately.

244
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,333
放你哥哥鴿子 在麗莉的派對上讓她難堪?
Standing up your brother? Humiliating Lilly at her own party?

245
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,430
我知道 搞砸了一切 我也抱歉 但現在不是談這個的時候
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry, but I can't talk about this now.

246
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,441
我要去紐約參加音樂大獎賽
I got to go to New York. It's the music awards.

247
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,739
你奶奶的生日就不重要了?
Your grandmother's birthday doesn't matter?

248
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,802
這完全是兩碼事 你知道的
This is totally different and you know it.

249
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,110
聽我說 羅比 羅先生
Now, Robby. Mr. Ray.

250
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,743
孩子他爸 要漢娜不去紐約絕對免談
Father Montana, Hannah not going to New York is really not an option.

251
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,380
- 她叫麥莉 - 我保證麥莉可以趕得回來
- Her name is Miley. - Miley'll be back before she leaves.

252
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,255
她是個明星 她想要的話 我可以幫她弄一架私人飛機
She's a superstar. I can get her a private jet if she wants.

253
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,886
太棒了 我早就想要了
Yes! I've always wanted one of those.

254
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,327
我的老天爺
For gosh sakes.

255
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,793
好 你們贏了
Fine. You win.

256
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,236
但你聽到我們小明星說的了 她需要一架飛機
But you heard our superstar. She needs a jet.

257
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,102
- 可以嗎? - 你能這樣想 我喜歡
- Really? - I like your thinking.

258
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,767
需要時間來安排
It will take some time to arrange,

259
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,538
我會先去紐約安排見面會的事宜
but I'll go ahead to New York and set up the meet and greet.

260
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:47,084
下次一定要訂衛生間大點的飛機
Ooh. Next time, you might want to demand a jet with a bigger bathroom.

261
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,219
你這麼就把漢娜的行頭穿上了
Why in the heck you getting all Hannahed up?

262
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,422
出艙亮相照
The Hannah steps off the plane photo op.

263
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,990
氣球 豪華禮車 粉絲瘋狂尖叫
The balloons, the limos, the screaming fans.

264
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,469
就像維塔說的 "公眾形象勝過一切 "
Like Vita says, "It's all about the publicity. "

265
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,406
對 維塔就是一個智囊團
Yeah. That Vita's just full of good advice.

266
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,072
絕對是滿肚子的鬼點子
Absolutely full of it.

267
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,478
你好 紐約!
Hello, New York!

268
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,890
好像你的豪華禮車來了
Looks like your limo's here.

269
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,265
她不美嗎?
Ain't she a beaut?

270
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,895
小兔崽子 這就是田納西
Yee doggies. Tennessee.

271
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,242
老爸 別這樣
Dad, come on.

272
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,974
是 我本應該記住奶奶生日的
Yeah, maybe I should've remembered Grandma's birthday.

273
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,744
- 我就記得 - 傑克森 不是現在
- I did. - Jackson, not now.

274
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:48,344
爸 不到三個小時之後 孟漢娜
Dad! Please, Hannah Montana needs to be walking down the red carpet

275
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,321
應該風光踩在紐約的紅地毯上
in New York in less than three hours.

276
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,518
孩子 你所追求的就是唱歌
Miley, all you ever wanted to do was sing.

277
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,255
漢娜讓你做到了 但你仍然有普通的生活要過
Hannah let you do that and still have a normal life.

278
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,058
這才是你的夢想 記得嗎
That was the dream, remember?

279
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,627
這就是我們為什麼一開始 製造了這樣一個偶像人物
That's why we created her in the first place.

280
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,898
我現在都不知道她的含義所在了
I don't know what she's about anymore.

281
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,031
- 你想說什麼 - 我想應該就此結束了
- What are you saying? - I think we might be done.

282
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,507
- 你不能把漢娜從我身邊奪走 - 是嗎 這正是我現在要做的
- You can't take Hannah away from me. - Really? Because that's what I'm doing.

283
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,674
不 把這卡車停下來 我不要這樣 我要回家
No! Stop the truck. I'm not doing this. I want to go home.

284
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,444
停車!
Stop the truck!

285
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,263
你到家了 看看周圍
You are home. Look around you.

286
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,898
漢娜是我的一切
Hannah means everything to me.

287
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,000
這個正是問題所在
That right there might be the problem.

288
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,407
我再也不能變成漢娜了嗎?
You're saying I can never be Hannah again?

289
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,078
兩星期以後再問我
Ask me again in two weeks.

290
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,485
現在讓我看看眼前的女孩 是否還是那個鄉村小姑娘
Right now let's see if a country girl still exists.

291
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,820
- 兩星期? - 把它當做漢娜戒除療程
- Two weeks? - Think of it as a Hannah detox.

292
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,951
把假髮脫了 回到車裡來
Take that wig off and get back in the truck.

293
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:06,795
我不進那卡車 絕不
No. I'm not getting back in the truck. No way.

294
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,299
我不坐卡車回去 爸爸
I'm not getting back in the truck, Dad.

295
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:21,039
不管你喜不喜歡 我一定要 回紐約 我不要...噢
I'm going to New York whether you like it or not, and I'm not... Whoa!

296
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,077
還給我 你這骯髒的小...
Give that back, you mangy little...

297
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,984
瞧瞧 這孩子連自己的馬都不認得
Look at that. Girl don't even recognize her own horse.

298
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,817
這真令人心涼啊
Now that truly is sad.

299
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,219
藍牛仔?
Blue Jeans?

300
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,962
屋裡見 沿著這條路往下一英里
Meet us at the house. Just about a mile up the road.

301
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,438
別忘了你的行李箱
Don't forget your suitcase.

302
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,080
錯不在我 你確實馬大十八變了
In my defense, you do look different.

303
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,715
你給尾巴整容了?
Did you do something to your tail?

304
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,848
好孩子 來 幫我一把
Good boy. All right, now. Help me out.

305
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,687
站著別動
Hold still.

306
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,988
藍牛仔
Blue Jeans!

307
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,288
藍牛仔
Blue Jeans!

308
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,238
Ya!

309
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,679
你還好吧?
Hi. You all right?

310
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,956
藍牛仔很怕陌生人
Blue Jeans doesn't really take well to strangers.

311
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,290
特別對衣著整潔光亮照人的美女
Especially not dirty, sparkly ones.

312
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,323
我知道 他是我的馬
I know. He's my horse.

313
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,763
麥莉?
Miley?

314
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,370
是我 特拉維斯
It's me. Travis?

315
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:05,399
特拉維斯布魯迪 我們一年級是同學
Travis Brody? We were in the first grade together.

316
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,708
我們倆去你叔叔厄爾農場玩 還有游泳
Me and you went to your Uncle Earl's farm and swam

317
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,806
- 結果被毒橡樹弄得全是... - 我記起你了 好吧
- and got poison oak all over our... - I remember you, OK?

318
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,377
我還記得你把我頭朝下吊在井裡
I also remember you hanging me headfirst down a well.

319
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,547
我其實從那以後就開始喜歡你
Yeah. I guess I had a pretty big crush on you back then.

320
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,648
別擔心
But don't worry about it.

321
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,361
早過去了
I'm over it.

322
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,658
我很高興
Good to know.

323
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,663
你現在不常回來 是吧
Don't come around too often anymore, do you?

324
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,466
太久沒回來了
Often enough.

325
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,440
你媽媽去世後只聽說過幾次你的消息
Only a couple times since your ma died that I've heard about.

326
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,000
這次打算呆多久?
So how long are you staying?

327
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,341
- 兩星期 - 哈
- Two weeks. - Ha!

328
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,370
- 祝你好運 - 這是什麼意思
- Good luck with that. - What's that supposed to mean?

329
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,009
考慮到你的穿著
Considering what you're wearing

330
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,645
和你不能爬到自己的馬的馬背上
and the fact that you couldn't get back on your horse,

331
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,655
我猜你是去了加州
I'm guessing you went California on us.

332
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,750
我沒有 你對我和加州都一無所知
I have not. You don't know anything about me or California.

333
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,654
讓我猜猜 明星和我們這種 普通人沒兩樣
Let me guess, celebrities are just regular folk like you and me.

334
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,427
- 有些是 - 哦 額
- Some are. - Oh. Uh-huh.

335
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,593
你 認識他們?
You, uh... you actually know any?

336
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,767
我認識 孟漢娜
I know Hannah Montana.

337
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,737
孟漢娜 真的?
Hannah Montana? Really?

338
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,909
對 我...
Yeah. I...

339
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,571
我前幾天衝浪的時候救過她的命
I practically saved her life surfing the other day.

340
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:19,107
她超級感激我 我們就像閨中密友
She owes me big time. We're like... We're like best friends.

341
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,619
哈 閨中密友
Huh. Best friends.

342
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,152
他們都在裡面等你 我來照看藍牛仔 把它給我
They're all waiting for you inside. I'll take Blue Jeans, put him away.

343
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,722
- 你不需要這麼做 - 這是我的工作
- You don't have to do that. - It's kind of my job.

344
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,401
我暑假一直在給你奶奶打工
I've been working for your grandma for the summer.

345
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,925
喔
Ooh.

346
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,599
一般現在是對方說 "謝謝"的時候
This is usually about the time someone would say "thank you. "

347
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,578
- 我正要開口呢 - 免了
- I was getting there. - No need.

348
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,044
回頭見 有活力的麥莉
See you round, Smiley Miley.

349
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,484
記得嗎 他過去這樣叫你的
Remember? That's what he used to call you. Smiley Miley.

350
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,779
我記得
I remember.

351
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,826
我的麥莉回來了
I got my Miley back!

352
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,767
來 麥莉 接下一段
Come on, Miley, take the next verse.

353
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,796
來吧
Come on.

354
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,143
你的狗會回來 你的家會回來
Get your dog back and your house back...

355
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,482
我想我的生活回來 爸爸
I want my life back, Dad.

356
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,259
對不起 對不起 大家
Sorry. Sorry, everybody. Hey.

357
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,693
生日快樂 奶奶
Happy birthday, Grandma.

358
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,632
我正吹了蠟燭 許了生日願望
Well, I just blew out my candles, and I already got my birthday wish.

359
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,431
過來 小甜心
Come here, sweet thing. Ohhh.

360
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,997
我想死你了
I have missed you more than you can imagine.

361
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,167
謝謝
And thank you.

362
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,873
謝謝送我這個 我太喜歡了
Thank you so much for this. I just love it.

363
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,040
世界上只有一個貓王
There's only one King,

364
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:35,815
我為他一直留著這個榮譽之位
and I have been saving him a place of honor.

365
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,815
你準備這禮物花了多長時間
How long have you been planning this?

366
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,521
肯定費了不少心血吧
Must have taken you forever to find it.

367
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,029
顯然 這幾個星期就沒想過別的
Apparently, I've thought of nothing else for weeks.

368
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,531
傷害奶奶的感情
Hurt your grandma's feelings

369
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,056
一頂爛假髮  你沒有絲毫內疚
and a chewed-up wig'll be the least of your worries.

370
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,298
查克舅舅 聽著 要切蛋糕了
Hey, Uncle Chuck. Listen, it's time for cake.

371
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,034
我負責收盤子 你去發叉子
I'll collect the supper plates, you pass out the forks.

372
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,042
給你個機會和親戚打聲招呼
Give you a chance to say hi to a few folks.

373
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,246
- 記得表兄戴立科嗎 - 這老鼠是怎麼回事
- You remember Cousin Derrick. - What's with the rat?

374
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,274
雪貂 叫哈羅
Ferret. Harlow.

375
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,751
- 回家真好 - 對
- Good to be home. - Yeah.

376
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,617
這有盤子要收嗎
Got any plates for me?

377
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,719
幫我個忙 過去跟羅莉萊自我介紹
Do me a favor. Introduce yourself to Lorelai over there.

378
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,220
新來的還很害羞
She's new and a little shy.

379
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,700
你不是又重新當起媒婆來了吧
You ain't up to your matchmaking again, are you?

380
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,068
- 我 怎麼可能 - 那就好
- Me? Never. - That's right.

381
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,199
主人絕不應該讓客人被晾在一旁
Then I reckon it would be a shame for anybody to feel left out.

382
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,143
不好意思 有盤子給我嗎
- Uh-huh. - Excuse me. Got anything for me?

383
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,745
我不知道 你一個人拿得下嗎
I don't know. Are you sure you can handle it?

384
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,545
你絕對會驚訝於我的能力
You'd be amazed at what I can handle.

385
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,650
很榮幸見到你 我叫羅比雷
I don't believe we've met. I'm Robby Ray.

386
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,245
- Oh! - Ha!

387
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,586
說過你會驚訝的
Told you you'd be amazed.

388
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,022
Yahh!

389
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,494
接到了 不是那麼糟 先生女士們
I got it. It's not that bad, ladies and gentlemen.

390
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,830
天哪
Oh, Lord!

391
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,143
- 你好! - 哦 不
- Howdy! - Oh, no.

392
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,779
Oh!

393
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,393
我滴神啊 好消息 各位
Whee doggies! Great news, everybody.

394
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,819
貓王仍然健在
Elvis is alive and well.

395
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,747
我一直想要換牆紙
I keep thinking I should change the wallpaper,

396
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,619
但這是你媽 像你這麼大時自己選的
but your mom picked this out when she was about your age.

397
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,618
我喜歡
I like it.

398
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,151
你曾經喜歡很多事情 好比 回來看我
You used to like a lot of things about coming to see me.

399
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,360
- 奶奶... - 沒關係的
- Grandma... - It's OK.

400
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,061
我知道不是針對我
I know it's not personal.

401
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,232
- 我只是想我的麥莉了 - 為什麼每個人都這樣說
- I just miss my Miley. - Why does everyone keep saying that?

402
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,869
也許你該捫心自問一下
Maybe you should be asking yourself that question.

403
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,907
樹枝上的毛毛蟲 可曾想過你是誰
Caterpillar in a tree How you wonder who you'll be

404
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,186
不能瀟灑走四方 但是夢想無限大
Can't go far But you can always dream

405
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,750
你爸爸過去每晚都會唱給你聽
Your daddy used to say that to you every night.

406
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,190
現在不唱了
Not so much anymore.

407
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,007
麥莉 太陽曬屁股了
Miley! Rise and shine!

408
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,954
行動開始 拯救孟漢娜
Commence Operation Save Hannah Montana.

409
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,619
早啊 睡得好嗎 我老早就起來了
Morning! Sleep well? I've been up for hours.

410
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,127
乾脆去餵喂雞 拿點蛋回來
How about I go feed the chickens and grab some eggs?

411
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:48,622
就像我說的 最美味的早餐 莫過於新鮮冒熱氣的雞蛋
Like I always say, ain't nothin' better than farm-fresh eggs for breakfast!

412
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,363
那位傻氣的村姑是誰?
Who in the Sam Heck was that?

413
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,941
來啊 嘰嘰嘰嘰嘰嘰嘰
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.

414
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,180
走開
Get away from...

415
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,914
Ahh!

416
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,288
她要多久才會想到應該放下桶子
How long you think before she figures out to put down the bucket?

417
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,057
我要...
Oh, I'm gonna...

418
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,204
看看 一個新鮮雞蛋
All right. Here we go, one farm-fresh egg.

419
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,740
- 你們等都不等我 - 親愛的 我們等了
- Y'all couldn't wait? - Darling, we waited,

420
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,185
但是我們後半生還是要繼續
but eventually we had to get on with the rest of our lives.

421
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,849
回房收拾一下 小蜜蜂 我要帶你去農貿集市
Get yourself cleaned up, honeybee. I'm taking you to the farmers' market.

422
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,919
Yay.

423
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,797
羅比雷 我的排水溝要人修
Oh, Robby Ray, my gutters need fixing.

424
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,858
還有卡車聲音太吵了 你壓根聽不下去
And my truck is making a noise you just don't want to hear.

425
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,267
我想辦法
I'm on it.

426
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,533
如果要人幫忙 去找工頭
If you need any help, talk to the foreman.

427
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,563
可能在菜園那邊
Might be down by the vegetable patch.

428
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,040
收到
Gotcha.

429
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,102
離我的南瓜遠點 它們可是得過獎的
But don't go squashing my squashes. They're prizewinners.

430
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,180
看起來你搶先一步
Looks like you beat me to it.

431
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,414
羅莉萊?
Lorelai?

432
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,324
露比沒說... 你就是工頭?
Uh, Ruby didn't... You're the foreman?

433
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,625
- 工頭就是我 - 也就是說你也住這附近?
- That would be me. - So that means you're living here, too?

434
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,859
你很會猜嘛
You're good at this.

435
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,132
那是我家 就在那邊
That's me, right over there.

436
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,999
我想有個新的開始 露比說我和農場
I was looking for a fresh start, and I guess Ruby thought

437
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,668
可以各取所需 所以
that both me and the farm could use some looking after, so...

438
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,507
她喜歡把東西都攪和在一塊 毫無疑問
She does like putting things together, that's for sure.

439
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,908
羅莉萊 工頭
Lorelai. The foreman.

440
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,285
這回好玩了
I'll be dang.

441
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,588
好了 孩子們
All right, you guys.

442
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,094
讓我給你們隆重介紹 泰咪溫斯特(美國鄉村歌手)
I'd like to introduce you all to Tammy Wynette.

443
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,860
她是世界上兩條腿中跑的最快的
She is the fastest two-legged animal in the world.

444
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,562
不能飛 不能游泳 但是可以...
She can't fly, she can't swim, but she sure can...

445
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,566
咬人 小心點
...bite. Be careful.

446
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,904
我們說好了的 除非你想讓快餐店菜單裡
We talked about this. Unless you want to see ostrich burgers

447
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,434
出現鴕鳥漢堡包
on the menu at the snack bar...

448
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,277
我來接手 去餵珍珠小姐
I'll take it from here. Go feed Miss Pearl.

449
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,646
不 我討厭珍珠小姐
No, I hate Miss Pearl.

450
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:57,450
孩子們 有誰想見見生龍活虎的
All right, kids. Who wants to see a real live...

451
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,952
...鱷魚
...alligator?

452
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,051
Let go!

453
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:18,933
救命!
Help!

454
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,242
啊
Ah!

455
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,049
那個母牛大乳頭是什麼意思
What's with the giant udder?

456
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,154
<font color="#ffff00">{a6}新飛越比佛利 第二季 北京時間9/9回歸 敬請關注 風軟字幕組出品{\a6}</font>
這在比弗利山莊 可看不見
That is something you don't see in Beverly Hills.

457
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,154
老克羅雷去世了 留下鎮上的牧場
Old Man Crowley died and left the town the meadows,

458
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,061
現在幾乎所有你看得到的
pretty much everything you can see.

459
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,361
但是我們沒錢繳稅
But we don't exactly have enough for the taxes,

460
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,062
我已經在組織資金籌備會
so I've been helping organize a fundraiser or two.

461
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:48,401
太可怕了 開發商就像盤旋的禿鷹
It's just awful. Developers circling like vultures.

462
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,438
伺機談論什麼建公寓樓 購物中心
Talking about putting up apartment buildings. Shopping malls.

463
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,444
購物中心 真的?
A mall? Really?

464
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,879
如果他們真的得逞 就不會有空地了
If they have their way, there won't be any open land left.

465
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,546
露比 喜歡這些嗎 年輕小姐
Hey, Ruby. How'd you like one of those, young lady?

466
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,886
- 謝謝 - 走吧 麥莉
- Thank you. - Come on, Miley.

467
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,448
- 有布魯明嗎(美著名百貨連鎖) - 我們還有事要做
- Would there be a Bloomie's? - We've got work to do.

468
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,982
對不起
Sorry.

469
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,388
- 這就是我們的未來 - 謝謝
- You're looking at the future. - Thank you.

470
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,557
Uh-huh.

471
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,525
Oh.

472
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,264
我發誓 那個男人的一切都讓我噁心
I swear, everything about that man irks me.

473
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,272
- 早 露比女士 - 早
- Morning, Miss Ruby. - Morning.

474
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,137
孫女也一起來了啊
See you got your granddaughter with you.

475
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,870
- 這個當然 - 是不是長高點了
- Yeah, sure do. - Ain't she grown some.

476
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,402
給點乾糧 喂點水 就有這種效果
Amazing what a little food and water will do.

477
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,508
和您聊天很愉快
Nice chatting.

478
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,486
我們幹完後去買點東西
When we finish, maybe you and I can do a little shopping.

479
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,545
這裡?不必了 我沒什麼需要的
In there? No, thanks. I'm good.

480
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,548
小姐 你回去是孟漢娜
Look, missy. You may be Hannah Montana back home,

481
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,824
但在這裡 我們就是鄉村牛仔
but here we're britches and boots. And...

482
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,560
如果你不滿意的話 大可以收拾行李走人
...if that ain't good enough for you, maybe you should just pack up and git.

483
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,831
你或許可以騙騙你爸爸 但休想騙得了我
You might be fooling your daddy, but you sure as heck ain't fooling me.

484
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,504
抱歉說話說得重了點
Now, I'm sorry for fussing at you,

485
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,240
但 我只是想讓你覺得慶幸
but... I just think you should consider yourself lucky that,

486
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,546
一直以來 你有個叫家的地方
for the time being, you have a place like this to call home.

487
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,678
我知道
I do.

488
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,219
對不起
And I'm sorry.

489
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,749
我明白的
I know you are.

490
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,158
來吧
Come on!

491
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,466
- 在這? - 對
- Right here? - Yeah.

492
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:28,097
把這個西瓜切開當試吃品
Now... slice up this watermelon for samples.

493
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,300
你們看的正是未來的克勞雷牧場
You're looking at the future of Crowley Meadows.

494
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,037
趁剛才的火還沒消 過去發揮一下
I'm going to take this mood of mine and put it to good use.

495
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,438
免費試吃 來一塊 小姐
Free samples! Here you go, girls.

496
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,541
露比 你可以盡情去籌款
Ruby, you can have as many fundraisers as you want,

497
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,142
但是你阻擋不了歷史的進步
but you are not going to stop progress.

498
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,314
把磨坊池塘變成垃圾場 我不覺得是進步
Turning Mills Pond into a landfill is not what I call progress.

499
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,015
很明顯...
Well, obviously...

500
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,192
一會就回來
I'll be right back.

501
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,826
- 早 - 早
- Morning. - Morning.

502
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,929
認識這個女孩嗎
Um, do you know this girl?

503
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,066
當然阿 是孟漢娜 我又不是山頂洞人
Sure, Hannah Montana. I don't live under a rock.

504
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,134
不 當然不是
No, obviously not. No, no.

505
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,840
- 要來試點嗎 - 那個來一點
- You wanna try something? - A bit of that.

506
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,370
好的
OK.

507
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,348
很美味 很好
That's very nice. That's delicious.

508
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,547
- 我一會就回來 - 也許她用了其他的名字
- Uh, I'll be right back. - Maybe she used a different name.

509
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,583
- 我不這樣認為 - 有人肯定知道她住哪
- I don't think so. - Somebody must know where she lives.

510
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,357
- 我必須離開一下 - 謝謝
- No. I got to go. - OK. Thank you!

511
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,080
- 麥莉 過來幫這位... - 起來
- Miley, help me get this... - Get up.

512
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,083
拉他起來 快點離開這裡
Help him up now. Let's get him out of here.

513
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,028
幫助一下這位可憐先生 你沒事吧
Help me with this poor man. Are you OK?

514
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,759
- 我真的 真的 萬分抱歉 - 別在意 親愛的 你太有才了
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry. - Honey, you are so forgiven.

515
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,233
你們太好了 不 我說真的
You're too kind. No, really.

516
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,035
你也是差不多大的 認識孟漢娜嗎
You're about the same age. You know this Hannah Montana?

517
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,736
孟漢娜!無人不知無人不曉 人家可是明星
Hannah Montana! Who don't know Hannah Montana? She's famous.

518
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,802
她對外公佈來自一個無名小鎮
She's telling everyone she's from this little patch of nowhere,

519
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,177
但這沒人見過她本人
but no one's ever seen her.

520
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,478
我見過 過去看過 知道他 過去知道
I seen her, saw her, know her, knew her.

521
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,314
- 你是第一個說這話的 - 我手上有她所有的情報
- You're the first one. - I know all the Montanas-es.

522
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,616
知道我能在哪裡找到她嗎
Do you know where I could find them?

523
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,318
出城往南5英里 第一個路口往右轉
Sure. You go about five miles south of town, turn right at the first crick.

524
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,121
- 第二個路口左轉 - 到達目的地
- Left at the second crook. - There you are.

525
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,525
- 到達目的地 - 噢

528
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,270
有人嗎
Hello?

529
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,177
有人在家嗎
Hello, anybody home?

530
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,412
- 什麼 - 我應該問"在哪"
- What? - A better question would be "where?"

531
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:59,348
例如"我的故事在哪"
As in "where's my story?"

532
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,476
對不起 等一下
Sorry, love. Two seconds.

533
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,853
- 你好 - 老爸 你在哪 沒給我們打電話
- Hello? - Daddy, where are you? You didn't call.

534
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,327
寶貝們 爸爸在工作 一會再打給你們啊
Sorry, darlings. Daddy's working. I'll call you back in two seconds.

535
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,660
快點 要熄燈了
Hurry. It's nearly lights out.

536
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,793
露辛達 不好意思 我保證 這一期孟漢娜的報道會...
Sorry, Lucinda. Don't worry. I guarantee this Hannah Montana story is...

537
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,302
孟漢娜
Hannah Montana!

538
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,237
太不敢相信了 老爸 幸好我們有打給你
I can't believe it! Dad! I'm glad we called you.

539
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,605
我真不敢相信 你見到她人了嗎
I don't believe this! Have you met her yet?

540
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:28,942
還沒有 女孩們
<i>Not now, girls!</i>

541
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,073
- 幫我們弄張簽名 - 我要暈過去了
- Please get us her autograph! - I'm going to faint!

542
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,380
誰在那 誰在鬼喊鬼叫的
Who's that? What's all that screaming?

543
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:38,354
- 寶貝們 我一會再打來 - 爸爸 爸爸 你要記得啊
- Darlings, I'll call you back. - Daddy, Daddy, make sure you do!

544
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,048
- 不好意思 你說到哪了? - 奧齊 我要一點骯髒的內幕
- Sorry. You were saying? - Ozzie, I want the dirt!

545
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,158
相信我 我已經夠骯髒了
Trust me, I'm all over it.

546
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,390
Oh.

547
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,303
彈錯了
Oh, I messed up. Um...

548
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,547
Oh...

549
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,960
我錯了 別停 這就走
Um, I'm sorry. Don't stop. I'm going.

550
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,304
別擔心 只是偷懶而已
Don't worry about it. I was goofing off.

551
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,776
很高興你還在唱歌
I think it's great you're still doing that singing thing.

552
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,676
唱歌 什麼唱歌
Singing thing? What singing thing?

553
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,477
每個人都知道這是你夢寐以求的
Come on. Everyone knows that's all you ever wanted to do.

554
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,848
你確實有一副好嗓子
And... you actually got a nice voice.

555
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,778
謝了 有人說過了
Thanks. I've heard that.

556
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,086
你覺得剛才那歌怎麼樣 我寫的
What did you think of the song? I wrote it.

557
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,563
- 歌 - 對 我剛才哼的那首
- Song? - Yeah, that thing I was just singing?

558
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,999
我沒有說是原創的?
Did I mention I wrote it?

559
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,868
大部分的音符都對了 繼續努力 麥莉
And it seems like you got most of the notes right. So way to go, Miley.

560
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,900
"大部分"?
"Most"?

561
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:15,109
- 為什麼不喜歡 - 我可沒有說不喜歡
- So why didn't you like it? - Jeez, I didn't say I didn't like it.

562
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,177
你口頭沒說 心裡有說
You sure didn't say you did.

563
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,213
- 是不賴 只是不夠... - 好
- It's not bad. It just wasn't... - Good.

564
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,020
沒有內容
About anything.

565
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,926
沒有傳遞給我任何東西 你的內心所想所感
Doesn't tell me anything about who you are or what you feel.

566
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,590
- 現在知道我內心所想嗎 - 我猜得到
- You know what I'm feeling now? - I've got an idea.

567
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,826
對不起 但你要我說的
And sorry, but you asked.

568
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,301
你在這搬來搬去打算幹什麼
Why are you bothering with this anyway?

569
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,398
雞蛋養殖 露比和我談好了
Starting up an egg business. Me and Ruby struck a deal.

570
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,534
我重建雞捨 生下來的蛋可以自己賣
I rebuild the coop, I get to sell the eggs.

571
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,804
那你的工程就夠大的
It's a lot of rebuilding.

572
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,405
總要有個起步 對吧
Hey, you got to start somewhere, right?

573
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,381
生活就像攀登 沿途風景無限
Life's a climb, but the view is great.

574
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,422
這就是你的夢想 在克勞雷賣雞蛋?
That's all you want to do, is sell eggs in Crowley Corners?

575
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,927
- 我還能去哪 - 我不是這個意思
- Where else am I going to? - That's not what I meant.

576
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,589
我知道你想說什麼 你不喜歡這裡 是吧
I know what you meant. You don't get this place, do you?

577
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,121
Ow. Ow.

578
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,067
- 把鞍裝上 - 我們要去哪
- Come on. Saddle up. - Where are we going?

579
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,162
帶你看看 你遺失的美好
To show you... what you're missing.

580
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,232
Ow.

581
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:41,961
- 輪到你了 - 沒門 不

Yes! We got it!

584
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,966

It's cold!

586
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,588

We should get going. We don't want to be late for the fundraiser.

587
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,997
唱的太棒了 老爸
Whoo-hoo! Good job, Daddy!

588
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:03,308
羅比雷 斯圖爾特 歡迎回來
Robby Ray Stewart, everybody. Good to have you back, sir.

589
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,250
- 你台上太帥了 - 謝謝 親愛的
- You were so great up there. - Thank you, honey.

590
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,285
他怎麼了 又不是沒約會過
What is the matter with him? He's dated before.

591
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,557
也許要開始認真對待
Maybe it's starting to mean something again.

592
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,862
讓我們平復一下心情 準備聽下一首 （國民小公主 泰勒絲）
We're going to slow it down for this next song, if that's all right.

593
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,706
- 想說什麼 - 她喜歡你 你喜歡他
- What? - She likes you. You like her.

594
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,212
把事情搞得這麼複雜幹嘛
Why do you have to make everything so complicated?

595
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,271
麥莉 你不會明白
Miley, you just wouldn't unders...

596
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:43,016
- 你怎麼知道她喜歡我 - 要是不是 那她就是瘋子
- How do you know she likes me? - Because she'd be crazy if she didn't.

597
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,816
說的有道理
You got a good point there.

598
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:48,848
我看到羅莉萊去後面了 也許你應該去幫幫忙
I saw Lorelai go out back. Maybe you can go help her with the empties.

599
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,085
我盡量
I could try.

600
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,109
麥莉 有幸跳一曲嗎?
Miley? Would you like to dance?

601
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,852
剛剛很抱歉
Sorry about that back there.

602
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,758
這次放假是為了麥莉的事 從沒想過自己
This trip was always supposed to be about Miley. Not really about me.

603
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,186
從沒想過開展一段戀情
Ever think the two might be related?

604
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,167
對 我們一家關係非常融洽 更加的
You're right. Our family's closer than most, more...

605
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,603
神秘?我覺察到了
Secretive? I've noticed.

606
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,372
她怎麼樣了
So how's she doing?

607
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,004

我們大家的 麥莉斯圖爾特
Our very own Miley Stewart, people.

676
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,024
你居然還有膽子來
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.

677
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,868
不好意思 我以為這是個社區集會
I'm sorry. I thought this was a community event.

678
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:40,603
社區 你腦裡有這詞的概念嗎
Community. You wouldn't even know what that word means.

679
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,102
我想你們的觀點只存在於舊時代
Well, I know that your idea of it is a thing of the past.

680
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,283
你們今晚募集了多少
How much y'all raise tonight?

681
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,785

682
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,085
2000美元?
Two thousand dollars?

683
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,785
你們給個數 我出雙倍
Whatever it is, I'll double it.

684
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,622
我們不要你的臭錢
We don't want your money.

685
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,526
今天就要過完了 你們這樣無濟於事
At the end of the day it ain't gonna matter.

686
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,996
你們可以來100次 但是不可能籌夠錢
You can have a hundred of these, you ain't gonna raise the money

687
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,522
要救牧場就需要奇跡
it's gonna take to save the Meadows,

688
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,194
除非披頭士過來辦一場慈善演出
not unless The Beatles show up for a benefit concert.

689
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:10,104
等等 小問題嘛
Oh, wait. Small problem.

690
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,608
你們遲早要妥協的 我們越早...
The sooner y'all accept the inevitable, the sooner we...

691

麥莉認識孟漢娜

692
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:20,177
- 誰在說話 - 她衝浪時救了她
- Who's that? - She saved her life surfing.

693
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:24,516
她們是閨中密友 她可以幫我們
They're best friends. She could help us out, right?

694
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:27,387
開一個演唱會 可以募集到數不完的錢
Throw a concert. That would raise a ton of money.

695
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,621
對 就這樣 對 打給她
Yeah! Yeah! Do it. Yeah. Call her.

696
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,685
- Yeah. - Uh...

697
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:37,689
我要不給她打個電話?
I guess I could give her a call.

698
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,703
孟漢娜認識麥莉?
Hannah Montana knows Miley?

699
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,148
老天爺 是孟漢娜 我愛你
Oh, my gosh! It's Hannah Montana! I love you, Hannah!

700
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,206
她來了 我真的沒想過她能來
Oh, my gosh. She's here. I didn't think she'd actually come.

701
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:23,303
謝謝 謝謝 謝謝來抱一個 謝謝
Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Give me a hug. Thank you.

702
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,174
太...鄉村了
So rustic.

703
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,517
- 我喜歡 麥莉 - 謝了
- I love it, Miley. - Thanks.

704
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,081
這個 "巨星拯救家鄉"的點子 簡直是個天才
This whole "pop star saves hometown" angle is genius.

705
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,425
但是休想讓我原諒你 把我一個人撇在紐約
Not so genius that I forgive you for ditching me in New York

706
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,362
差點丟了工作 無論如何 你還是個天才
and almost costing me my job, but genius nevertheless.

707
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,694
你肯定是奶奶了
So you must be Granny.

708
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:53,301
可愛極了 看這地方
Adorable. Oh, look at this place.

709
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:56,779
太 ... 多麼的...額
It's just so, um... And, uh...

710
00:56:56,813 --> 00:57:00,840
- 一直都是這個味道? - 基本上是
- It always smell like this? - Pretty much.

711
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,075
借過
Excuse me.

712
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,817
我很抱歉 你是我最好的朋友
I am so sorry. You are the best friend I have ever had.

713
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,881
原本以為你不會跟我說話了
When I thought you weren't gonna talk to me,

714
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,985
- 我可能永遠失去你了 - 只要你不想休想甩掉我
- that I might lose you forever... - Couldn't lose me if you wanted to.

715
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,757
太好了 因為我可不想
Good, because I don't want to.

716
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,460
我也對不住你 跟那個記者亂說
And... sorry about talking to that reporter guy.

717
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,904
什麼 是你告訴記者的?為什麼
What? Lilly, you're the one that talked to the reporter? How could you?

718
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,271
現在不是"互相道歉時刻"嗎
I thought this was one of those "you're sorry, I'm sorry" moments.

719
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:28,436
我是很愧疚的 我保證漢娜不會 出現在我們之間了
It is, and I am. And I swear Hannah'll never come between us again.

720
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,502
好的
OK.

721
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:32,014
- 麥莉? - 在
- Miley? - Yeah?

722
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,608
我能進來 和你跟漢娜聊兩句嗎
Could I come in and talk to you and Hannah?

723
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,482
- 你當漢娜 - 不 你才是
- You be Hannah. - No, you're Hannah.

724
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,511
- 我不能 你來當 別吵了 - 麥莉?
- I can't. No, you be Hannah. Stop it. - Miley?

725
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,955
這是很重要的事
It's kind of important.

726
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,014
- 不 - 後面
- No. - Back.

727
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,821
不要這樣
Stop doing this.

728
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,351
停下
Stop!

729
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,728
進來
Come in.

730
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,531
很抱歉 我不知道
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize...

731
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,133
別擔心 放鬆療法罷了
No worries. This is just a little de-stressing.

732
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,802
有助於時差
It helps with Hannah's jet lag.

733
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:03,506
時差? 但加州到這才兩小時
Jet lag? But California's only two hours...

734
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:07,004
對 但她只從西邊往東邊飛
Yes. But Hannah only flies west to east,

735
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,884
這樣她就賺到了時間 有的時候
so... she gains time. She sometimes has to go

736
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,787
她要故意繞遠路飛 實際上她在變年輕
the long way around. She's actually getting younger.

737
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,621
- 你有話說? - 哦 是的
- Did you want something? - Uh, yeah.

738
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,058
嗨 漢娜
Hi, Hannah.

739
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:23,122

足底按摩
Foot massage.

742
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,668
洛杉磯風格
Very L.A.

743
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,574
- 麥莉 你在上面嗎 - 他不知道
- Miley, you up there? - He doesn't know.

744
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,775
漢娜在這 他肯定會興奮的
That Hannah's here. He is going to be so excited.

745
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,180
- 我去告訴他 - 那我來接手吧
- Let me tell him. - I'll take over.

746
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,380
不 漢娜當我是私人  知道嗎
No. Hannah considers me her personal, you know...

747
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,581
有些事情需要  你來
There's these things that... Fine.

748
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,590
但是 不許說話
Hey, but no talking.

749
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,301
Mmm-hmmm.

750
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:05,364
市長為了給你接風準備舉辦盛宴
So the mayor wants to throw this big bash in your honor this evening.

751
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:10,209
我已經訂了龍蝦空運過來 全都是為你準備好了
And I've had lobsters flown in and everything just for you.

752
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,111
我希望它們不會也有時差
I hope they don't get too jet-lagged.

753
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:14,941
總之
Anyway...

754
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,614
老爸
Dad!

755
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,589
- 你在做什麼 - 修你奶奶的排水槽
- Dad, what are you doing? - Fixing your grandma's gutter.

756
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,683
幫我扶梯子 別踩爛了南瓜
Hold the ladder for me. And don't squish the squashes.

757
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,251
先下來 有急事 我需要你
Please come down. It's an emergency. I need you now.

758
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,821
- 你同意了?
- Is that a yes? - Mm-hm.

759
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:33,461
哦 這太好了
Oh! Oh, that's fantastic. Wow.

760
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,802
羅莉萊為什麼在按漢娜的腳
What is Lorelai doing rubbing Hannah's feet?

761
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,740
- 準確來說 那是麗莉的 - 別動
- Technically, they're Lilly's. - Stay.

762
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,234
爸 我們準備好了 跟戴立科說過了
Dad. Dad, we're all set. I talked to Derrick, and...

763
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,247
- 他怎麼了 - 噓 過來
- What's with him? - Shh. Come here.

764
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,943
嘿 羅莉萊
Hey. Lorelai.

765
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,010
- 為何不讓漢娜休息一下 - 噓 她應該睡著了
- Why don't you let Hannah rest... - Shh, I think she's asleep.

766
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,583
可憐 時差
Poor thing. Jet lag.

767
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,254
她只從西往東飛
She only flies west to east.

768
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:02,958
什麼 這是我這輩子聽到最雷人的說法
What? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

769
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,763
某種明星病
Some kind of celebrity thing.

770
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:09,499
但她同意了 她會出席市長的晚宴

It was my job to get her there, and she is coming.

772
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,338
- 太好了 - 你會來的吧
- Great. - You're going, right?

773
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,884
不知道
I don't know.

774

I mean there are just so many.

912
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:30,423
我可不想成為今晚的重點
But I don't want this evening to be all about me.

913
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:33,799
我是說 每個人都有故事 是吧 傑克森
I mean, everybody's stories are important, right, Jackson?

914
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,066
- 什麼? - 你剛剛上大學
- Huh? - You just started college.

915
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:39,199
- 說說你的同學吧 - 我的同學 額
- Tell us about your classes. - Yeah, my classes. Uh...

916
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,334
我很喜歡...
I really like...

917
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,006
我最喜歡的部分是...
I think my favorite part is...

918
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:50,046
老爸 你的臭小子已經變成真男人了
Dad, that your little boy is growing up into a man.

919
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,109
哦
Oh!

920
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,084
糟糕 餐巾掉了
Oops, dropped my napkin.

921
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,149
哈羅
Harlow!

922
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,991
- 哈羅
- Harlow! - Ow!

923
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,122
- 你在幹什麼 - 找一支雪貂
- What are you doing? - Looking for a ferret.

924
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,189
- 你在幹什麼 - 試圖開啟我的第一次
- What are you doing? - Trying to have my first

925
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,700
成熟的情感大門 現在你給我上去
mature relationship. Now get back up there.

926
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:10,929
找到了
Found it.

927
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,213
Um...

928
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:31,654
- 我要龍蝦 - 菜單上沒有
- I'm having the lobster. - It's not on the menu.

929
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:32,956
是嗎
Right.

930
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:45,633
這幾天太混亂了 對不起
Sorry. It's been a weird couple of days, but...

931
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,869
是的
Yeah.

932
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,311
我想我能猜到幾分你要說的話
And I think I know some of the things you want to tell me.

933
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,275
是嗎
Yeah?

934
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:59,310
我也有話要對你說
There are so many things I want to tell you, too, and...

935
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,652
但好像時機尚未成熟
That's just going to have to wait.

936
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,684
我要回去看看我的龍蝦
I need to go double-check on my lobsters.

937
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:56,242
- 我去拿蘇打水 - 坐下 夠了
- Club soda will take that out. - Sit! That's enough.

938
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,576
沒人離開這張桌子 沒人
No one is getting up from this table. No one.

939
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:01,144
有人要甜點嗎
Dessert, anyone?

940
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,549
你們肯定聽過火山冰激凌
I'm sure you've all heard of baked Alaska.

941
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,678
請看田納西火焰冰山
We give you Tennessee flambe.

942
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,160
市長先生 請您致結束語
Mr. Mayor, I assume that you'd like to say a few final words?

943
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:15,254
哦 對的
Oh, yes, yes.

944
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:19,324
鮮少有人知道 田納西火焰冰山的發明者
Not many people know that the Tennessee flambe was actually invented by...

945
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,845
過來
Come here.

946
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,905
- 市長 - 我抓到你了
- Mr. Mayor! - I got you now.

947
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,515
哈羅
Harlow!

948
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:48,760
起火了
We got a fire!

949
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,030
真見鬼
Dang flam it!

950
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:19,990
一切都在掌握之中 你覺得呢
This has all gone very well. Don't you think?

951
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,568
對不起 借過
Sorry, excuse me. Excuse me.

952
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,188
特拉維斯 聽我解釋
Travis, please let me explain.

953
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,060
解釋什麼
Explain what?

954
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,691
說你在耍我玩
That you've been making fun of me?

955
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,668
嘲笑我 一直都在騙我?
Laughing at me? Lying to me this whole time?

956
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:39,770
我坦誠以對 告訴你我的感覺
I was honest with you. I told you how I felt.

957
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,800
- 我對你也一樣 - 不 你不是的
- And I feel the same way. - No, you don't.

958
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:45,245
我早知道的話 不會那樣對待你了
Because I would have never treated you like that.

959
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,738
你知道嗎 麥莉 漢娜 不管你是哪個
You know what, Miley... Hannah, whoever you are?

960
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,775
我們完了
We're done.

961
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,117
特拉維斯
Travis!

962
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,520
特拉維斯 求你了
Travis, please.

963
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:23,549
- 看到了? - 我看到了
- Did you see? - Yeah, I saw.

964
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,522
羅比雷 是你在下面嗎
Robby Ray, is that you down there? Uh...

965
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,889
現在不行 羅莉萊 我有一些家庭私事
Not now, Lorelai. I've got some family stuff going on.

966
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,196
對不起 這整件事太糟糕了
I'm sorry. It's just this whole evening was a disaster.

967
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:40,031
我一手準備的全被那女孩 進進出出的搞砸了
I just organized the whole thing, and then that girl comes in and ruins it.

968
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,059
我可不關心她辦什麼演唱會
I don't care if she is here for a big concert.

969
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:45,562
她生活已經夠複雜了 我知道很難接受
She's got a complicated life. I know it's hard to understand, but...

970
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,270
出什麼事了 羅比
What's going on, Robby Ray?

971
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:53,077
我真的沒時間忍受謊言和秘密了
I really don't have any time for secrets and lies.

972
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:56,744
我不知道能不能和一個 樂在其中的人繼續下去
I don't know if I could be happy with somebody comfortable living in them.

973
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,685
我明白 你不需要的
I know. You shouldn't have to be.

974
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,783
我早就應該告訴你真相
I should have told you the truth.

975
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,789
真相是...
The truth is that...

976
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:12,093
我現在沒有心情開始一段新感情
...I just don't have any place in my life for a relationship right now.

977
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,467
我和麥莉 容不下其他人 我們必須去解決這一切
There's no room. Miley and me, we've got to sort through some things.

978
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:20,669
她需要我 我需要在她的身邊
And she needs me. And I kind of need to be there for her.

979
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:24,510
對不起
I'm sorry.

980
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,142
我也一樣
Well, me too then.

981
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,278
抱歉
Me too.

982
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,858
漢娜 漢娜 漢娜
Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah.

Hey, caterpillar.

984
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:25,666
謝了
Thanks.

985
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:27,666
不用謝
No problem.

986
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:40,510
- 你生氣嗎 - 我不生氣 你?
- Are you mad? - No, I'm not mad. You?

987
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,549
不
No.

988
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:49,463
- 歌創作得怎麼樣 - 不知道 還沒譜呢
- How's the song coming? - I don't know. I'm not sure yet.

989
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:52,260
關於什麼的
What's it about?

990
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,460
你
You.

991
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,930
我
Me.

992
