looking like Miley,

Hey, Lilly. What's up?

162
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,969
We've talked about this party
since we were, like, 12. Where...

163
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,909
- Hi! How are you? Where are you?
- I'm almost there.

- Miley!

Where's Miley? We haven't seen her.

Rico, what's this hole
at the top of the cake?

171
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,832
It's a high-pressure
electro-pneumatic solenoid on it.

172
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:27,328
It's 150 pounds per square inch
with a brass safety-check valve.

Then I just hit this button
and bam! Sparklers go off,

and a "happy birthday, Lilly" banner
shoots out the top of the cake.

I'll make it up to you, I promise.

Hold up. Wait. Birthday Girl,
I have some questions.

211
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,139
Is it true Hannah's really 43 years old?
She lip syncs? Grew up in Nashville?

212
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,115

some place called Crowley Corners.

a little conversation.

Now? But she's getting ready
to go to New York.

Didn't she tell you?
There's an amazing opportunity.

Yeah, I know about New York. I got
CCed in an e-mail. Not happening.

into a stinking shoe fight?

In my defense,
I totally saw those shoes first.

This is absolutely, T-totally,
without a doubt unacceptable.

all of your behavior lately.

I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry,
but I can't talk about this now.

I got to go to New York.
It's the music awards.

doesn't matter?

to New York is really not an option.

a private jet if she wants.

00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,886
Yes! I've always wanted
one of those.

She needs a jet.

- Really?
- I like your thinking.

251
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,767
It will take some time to arrange,

252
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,538
but I'll go ahead to New York
and set up the meet and greet.

253
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:47,084
Ooh. Next time, you might want to
demand a jet with a bigger bathroom.

270

Miley, all you ever
wanted to do was sing.

271
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,255
Hannah let you do that
and still have a normal life.

never be Hannah again?

Ask me again in two weeks.

I also remember you hanging me
headfirst down a well.

Yeah. I guess I had a
pretty big crush on you back then.

- Good luck with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

327
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,009
Considering what you're wearing

328

and the fact that you couldn't
get back on your horse,

329

I'm guessing you
went California on us.

I have not. You don't know

766
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,608
[Lorelai] Could I come in
and talk to you and Hannah?

767
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,482
- You be Hannah.
- No, you're Hannah.

768
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,511
- I can't. No, you be Hannah. Stop it.
- [Lorelai] Miley?

769
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,955
It's kind of important.

770
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,014
- No.
- Back.

771
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,821
Stop doing this.

772
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,351
- [Both stammering]
- [Lilly] Stop!

773
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,728
- [Thud]
- [Miley] Come in.

774
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,164
[Gasps]

775
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,864
<i>[Hawaiian music playing]</i>

776
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,531
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize...

777
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,133
No worries. This is just
a little de-stressing.

778
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,802
It helps with Hannah's jet lag.

779
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:03,506
Jet lag? But California's
only two hours...

780
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:07,004
Yes. But Hannah only flies west to east,

781
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,884
so... she gains time.
She sometimes has to go

782
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,787
the long way around.
She's actually getting younger.

783
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,621
- Did you want something?
- Uh, yeah. [laughs]

784
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,058
Hi, Hannah.

785
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:23,122
I'm Lorelai. And we are just
all so grateful that you're here.

786
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,566
Oh, well... [yelps]

787
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,363
Foot massage. [grunts]

788
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,668
- Very L.A.
- [Laughs]

789
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,574
- [Robby Ray] Miley, you up there?
- He doesn't know.

790
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,775
That Hannah's here.
He is going to be so excited.

791
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,180
- Let me tell him.
- I'll take over.

792
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,380
No. Hannah considers me
her personal, you know...

793
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,581
There's these things that... Fine.

794
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,590
Hey, but no talking.

795
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,301
[Lilly] Mmm-hmmm.

796
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:05,364
So the mayor wants to throw this
big bash in your honor this evening.

797
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:10,209
And I've had lobsters flown in
and everything just for you.

798
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,111
I hope they don't get too jet-lagged.

799
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:14,941
Anyway...

800
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,614
Dad!

801
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,589
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Fixing your grandma's gutter.

802
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,683
Hold the ladder for me.
And don't squish the squashes.

803
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,251
Please come down.
It's an emergency. I need you now.

804
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,821
- Is that a yes?
- [Lilly] Mm-hm.

805
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:33,461
Oh! [laughs]
Oh, that's fantastic. Wow.

806
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,802
What is Lorelai doing
rubbing Hannah's feet?

807
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,740
- Technically, they're Lilly's.
- Stay.

808
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,234
Dad. Dad, we're all set.
I talked to Derrick, and...

809
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,247
- What's with him?
- Shh. Come here.

810
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,943
Hey. Lorelai.

811
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,010
- Why don't you let Hannah rest...
- Shh, I think she's asleep.

812
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,583
Poor thing. Jet lag.

813
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,254
She only flies west to east.

814
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:02,958
What? That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

815
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,763
Some kind of celebrity thing.

816
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:09,499
But she said yes.
She's coming to the mayor's dinner.

817
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:13,100
It was my job to get her there,
and she is coming.

818
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,338
- Great.
- You're going, right?

819
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,884
I don't know.

820
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,249
Is this you asking?

821
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,455
Yeah. I think it might be.

822
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,152
Then this is me accepting.

823
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:38,359
- I think they're gonna kiss.
- Yes!

824
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,301
Go, Daddy! Go, Daddy!

825
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,732
[Snoring]

826
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,672
- Whoo!
- [Clears throat]

827
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,836
Certainly is getting hot in here.
I think I'll open up the window.

828
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,813
I don't want her
to sleep in a stuffy room.

829
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,644
Daddy, Daddy.

830
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,022
Oh, Jackson!

831
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,523
Are you OK? Watch it. Ladder.

832
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,554
Are you all right?
Let me help you.

833
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,759
I'm OK. I'm OK.

834
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,833
Mmm.

835
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:21,640
These taste... healthy.
What's in them?

836
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:23,604
Squash.

837
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:29,309
Ooh. I want a cowboy.

838
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,980
Sorry. That one's taken.

839
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,215
- Really?
- Yeah.

840
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,915
No.

841
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:40,087
Maybe. I don't know. It looks like
we're going to be just friends.

842
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:42,855
But he hasn't met Hannah yet.

843
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,463
- Come on.
- [Drill whirring]

844
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,265
[Drilling]

845
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:54,265
- So, Ha...
- [drilling loudly]

846
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,743
- Ha...
- [drilling loudly]

847
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,139
Hey, look! It's Hannah Montana!

848
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:04,283
Oh, hi. Sorry, I... I didn't see you.

849
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,185
I'm Travis. Thanks for coming.

850
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:10,886
Yeah, happy to help.
This is Lilly. She's my assistant.

851
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,451
Executive assistant.

852
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,420
Welcome to Crowley Corners.

853
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:19,492
It sure would be nice to have
someone to... show us around.

854
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,059
- Real smooth.
- What?

855
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:25,598
Look, I really don't think
I'm your guy. But nice to meet you.

856
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:28,633
- [Sputters]
- No, go. Go!

857
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,575
So... putting up a satellite dish.

858
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,610
It's a birdbath.

859
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,678
- [Laughs]
- I knew that.

860
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:44,088
Lilly, could you go find
the owner of this fine house

861
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,152
and run them through my dietary needs?

862
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,262
Go. Assist.

863
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,297
OK.

864
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,667
So, you and Miley are pretty close, huh?

865
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,004
You have no idea.

866
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,907
[Laughs] You don't have to answer
if you think this is too personal,

867
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,381
but you think she'd go out
with me if I asked?

868
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:07,973
You want to go out with Miley?

869
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:11,413
No, you'd be a real prize.
Don't get me wrong, but...

870
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,589
But Miley...

871
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,718
I can't help but smile
when I'm around her.

872
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:23,255
I think about her all the time. And I...

873
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,698
You should go ask her out.

874
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,394
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

875
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,707
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going
to do that right now.

876
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,938
No, no. No. Excuse me.

877
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,947
You can't go in there.
She's not home. Miley! She's not home.

878
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,246
She said something about going
to the barn and brushing Blue Jeans.

879
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,345
You should go ask her there.
Go, go, go! Go. Goodbye.

880
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,417
Go!

881
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,821
- Slow down, hot stuff.
- Got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

882
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,989
[Chickens clucking]

883
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,362
Miley?

884
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:00,062
[Gasping]

885
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:05,098
[Travis] Miley! Miley, are you...?

886
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,506
Hey, slacker.

887
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,511
Uh, hey.

888
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,473
I was just talking
to your friend, Hannah.

889
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,144
Actually, we were talking about you.

890
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,916
Oh, really. Was there
something you wanted to say

891
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,857
or ask me or talk to me about?

892
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,425
Well, I know you're going home soon.

893
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,226
Yeah, I am. That's right,
Travis, keep going.

894
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:32,598
Um, well...

895
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:37,004
I was wondering if maybe you would like
to go to dinner with me this evening.

896
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,406
OK. Sure.

897
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,934
I don't think I have
any other plans, so sounds good.

898
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:46,540
- Cool.
- Cool.

899
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:53,618
Cool.

900
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:56,216
Now you're talking.
Oh, that is the one.

901
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,591
Yeah, it would be,
but she's not going.

902
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,925
What do you mean I can't go?

903
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,362
You're the one that promised
Lorelai that Hannah

904
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,595
would be the guest of honor at
the mayor's lobster hoo-hah tonight.

905
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,502
- Actually, Lilly did.
- Actually, Hannah did.

906
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,027
But I promised Travis.

907
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:13,166
You know what?
Then I'll just leave it up to you.

908
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,972
You do whatever you think is right.

909
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,171
But...

910
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,421
[girls screaming]

911
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,896
It's Hannah Montana!

912
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,939
Can I have your autograph,
Hannah Montana?

913
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:56,977
[Vita] Smile.

914
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,384
- Yeah!
- Perfect.

915
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,716
Where's Miley?
She should be here by now.

916
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,459
Hon, she's got
East Coast-West Nile disease.

917
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,898
- That sucker's traveling.
- Yeah.

918
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,469
If everybody could please
take their seats.

919
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,633
- Yes, be seated, everybody.
- Find their place card there.

920
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:24,840
And let me just say that, honestly,

921
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,178
