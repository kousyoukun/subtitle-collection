Didn't she tell you?

258
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,410
鞋子大战  你竟然能卷入了一场该死的鞋子大战
A shoe fight! You got into a stinking shoe fight?

259
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,780
我认为明明是我先看见那双鞋的
In my defense, I totally saw those shoes first.

260
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,390
知道吗
You know what?

261
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:45,020
这根本完全绝对毫无疑问地不是一个理由
This is absolutely, T-totally, without a doubt unacceptable.

262
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,930
你最近的一切行为举止都是这样
Which pretty much describes all of your behavior lately.

263
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,330
做事儿根本不考虑你哥  还在Lilly的生日派对上羞辱她
Standing up your brother? Humiliating Lilly at her own party?

264
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,430
我知道我都搞砸了  我很抱歉  但是我现在不想谈这个
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry, but I can't talk about this now.

265
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,440
我要去纽约  参加音乐奖颁奖典礼
I got to go to New York. It's the music awards.

266
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,730
就连你姥姥的生日都可以无视了
So your grandmother's birthday doesn't matter?

267
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,800
这是两码事儿  你心里清楚
Dad, this is totally different and you know it.

268
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,110
好了  Robby Ray先生
Now, Robby. Mr. Ray.

269
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,740
Montana父亲  Hannah不去纽约真的是行不通的
Father Montana, Hannah not going to New York is really not an option.

270
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,380
-她叫Miley  -Miley会赶回去的
- Her name is Miley. - Miley'll be back before she leaves.

271
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,250
她是个超级巨星  如果她需要的话我能给她弄一架私人飞机来
She's a superstar. I can get her a private jet if she wants.

272
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,880
没错  我一直想要一架
Yes! I've always wanted one of those.

273
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,320
老天爷啊
For gosh sakes.

274
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,790
好吧  你赢了
Fine. You win.

275
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,230
不过你听见我们的超级明星说什么了吗  她要一架飞机
But you heard our superstar. She needs a jet.

276
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,100
-真的吗  -我喜欢你的态度
- Really? - I like your thinking.

277
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,760
这个得花些时间来安排
It will take some time to arrange,

278
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,530
不过我就得先去纽约安排行程了
but I'll go ahead to New York and set up the meet and greet.

279
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,080
下一次  你最好弄一架卫生间大点的飞机来
Next time, you might want to demand a jet with a bigger bathroom.

280
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,210
你为啥现在就打扮成Hannah的装束了
Why in the heck you getting all Hannahed up?

281
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,420
Hannah走下舷梯的时候就会有记者拍照了啊
The Hannah steps off the plane photo op. You know.

282
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,990
还有气球  礼车  尖叫的粉丝
The balloons, the limos, the screaming fans.

283
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,460
就像Vita说的一样 “这就叫宣传活动”
Like Vita says, "It's all about the publicity. "

284
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,400
是啊  Vita总是有那么多好建议
Yeah. That Vita's just full of good advice.

285
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,070
满脑子都是
Absolutely full of it.

286
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,470
你好  纽约
Hello, New York!

287
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,890
看样子你的礼车来了
Looks like your limo's here.

288
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,260
这家伙够美吧
Ain't she a beaut?

289
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,890
田纳西  老子来了
Yee doggies. Tennessee.

290
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,240
爸  听我说
Dad, come on.

291
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,970
没错  我是应该记着姥姥的生日的
Yeah, maybe I should've remembered Grandma's birthday.

292
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,740
-我记着呢  -Jackson 别插嘴
- I did. - Jackson, not now.

293
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,570
爸  求你了
Dad! Please,

294
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,340
再过不到三个小时Hannah Montana内就应该
Hannah Montana needs to be walking down the red carpet

295
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,320
走在纽约的红地毯上
in New York in less than three hours.

296
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,510
Miley  你原来只是想去唱歌而已
Miley, all you ever wanted to do was sing.

297
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,250
Hannah这个身份让你在唱歌的同时还能过正常的生活
Hannah let you do that and still have a normal life.

298
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,050
这是你的梦想  还记得吗
That was the dream, remember?

299
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,620
这才是我们当初设计出这个形象的目的
That's why we created her in the first place.

300
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,890
老实说  我不知道她现在还有什么意义
Being honest, I don't know what she's about anymore.

301
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,030
-你说什么  -我想说我觉得我们可以结束这一切了
-What are you saying? -I'm trying to say I think we might be done.

302
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,670
你不能把Hannah从我身上夺走
You can't take Hannah away from me.

303
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,500
是么  我就准备这么做呢
Really? Because that's what I'm doing.

304
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,670
不行  快把卡车停下  我不能这么做  我要回家
No! Stop the truck. I'm not doing this. I want to go home.

305
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,440
把车停下
Stop the truck!

306
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,260
你已经回家了  看看你的周围
You are home. Look around you.

307
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,890
Hannah就是我的一切
Hannah means everything to me.

308
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,000
这正是问题所在之处
That right there might be the problem.

309
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,400
你的意思是  我再也不能做Hannah了
You're saying I can never be Hannah again?

310
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,070
两个星期以后再问我
Ask me again in two weeks.

311
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,480
现在让我们看看那个乡村女孩还活着没有
Right now let's see if a country girl still exists.

312
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,820
-两个星期  -你就把它当成是戒一戒当Hannah的瘾
- Two weeks? - Think of it as a Hannah detox.

313
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,950
把假发摘下来  回到卡车里去
Take that wig off and get back in the truck.

314
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,790
不  我不上车  绝对不上
No. I'm not getting back in the truck. No way.

315
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,290
我不上车  爸爸
I'm not getting back in the truck, Dad.

316
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,270
不管你愿不愿意  我都要去纽约
I'm going to New York whether you like it or not,

317
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,030
我不上  喔
and I'm not... Whoa!

318
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,070
还给我  你这个脏兮兮的小
Give that back, you mangy little...

319
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,980
你看看  小姑娘都不认识她自己的马了
Look at that. Girl don't even recognize her own horse.

320
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,810
实在太可悲了
Now that truly is sad.

321
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,210
蓝仔
Blue Jeans?

322
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,960
我们屋里见  沿着路往前走一英里就到了
Meet us at the house. Just about a mile up the road.

323
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,430
别忘了你的行李箱
Don't forget your suitcase.

324
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,080
我真觉得你的确变得不一样了
In my defense, you do look different.

325
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,710
你是不是把你的尾巴处理了一下
Did you do something to your tail?

326
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,840
好孩子  好了  帮我个忙
Good boy. All right, now. Help me out.

327
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,680
别动
Hold still.

328
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,980
蓝仔
Blue Jeans!

329
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,280
蓝仔
Blue Jeans!

330
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,670
嗨  你还好吗
Hi. You all right?

331
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,950
蓝仔对待陌生人不是很友好
Blue Jeans doesn't really take well to strangers.

332
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,290
尤其对一点也不土  还亮丽十足的人
Especially not dirty, sparkly ones.

333
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,320
我知道  他是我的马
I know. He's my horse.

334
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,760
Miley
Miley?

335
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,370
是我  Travis
It's me. Travis?

336
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,390
Travis Brody  我们一起上的一年级
Travis Brody. We were in the first grade together.

337
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,700
我和你一起去Earl叔叔的农场游泳
Me and you went to your Uncle Earl's farm and swam

338
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,800
-还把毒葛弄得满身  -我记得你  好吗
- and got poison oak all over our... - I remember you, OK?

339
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,370
我还记得你把我头朝下悬着往井里放
I also remember you hanging me headfirst down a well.

340
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,540
是啊  我猜我后来还真是喜欢上你了
Yeah. I guess I had a pretty big crush on you back then.

341
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,640
不过别担心
But don't worry about it.

342
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,360
都过去了
I'm over it.

343
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,650
那就行
Good to know.

344
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,660
也不经常回来看看了  是不
Don't come around too often anymore, do you?

345
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,460
够经常的了
Often enough.

346
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,440
我听说自从你妈去世以后你就没回来过几次了
Only a couple times since your ma died that I've heard about.

347
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,000
那么你这次要呆多长时间
So how long are you staying?

348
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,340
-两个星期  -哈
- Two weeks. - Ha!

349
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,370
-祝你好运  -此话怎讲
- Good luck with that. - What's that supposed to mean?

350
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,000
考虑到你穿的穿着打扮
Considering what you're wearing

351
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,640
和你不会骑到你的马上的事实
and the fact that you couldn't get back on your horse,

352
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,650
我猜你是到加利福尼亚当大小姐去了
I'm guessing you went California on us.

353
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,750
我才没有  你根本不了解我和加利福尼亚
I have not. You don't know anything about me or California.

354
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,650
让我猜猜  那些名流和你我一样都是普通人吧
Let me guess, celebrities are just regular folk like you and me.

355
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,420
-有些是  -哦  啊哈
- Some are. - Oh. Uh-huh.

356
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,590
你  呃  认识哪些名人嘛
You, uh... you actually know any?

357
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,760
我认识Hannah Montana
I know Hannah Montana.

358
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,730
Hannah Montana  真的吗
Hannah Montana? Really?

359
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,900
是啊  我
Yeah. I...

360
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,570
实际上她冲浪的时候我救过她的命
I practically saved her life surfing the other day.

361
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,100
她欠我个大人情  我们就像  就像是最好的朋友
She owes me big time. We're like... We're like best friends.

362
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,610
嗬  最好的朋友
Huh. Best friends.

363
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,450
我猜他们都在里面等你呢
I guess they're all waiting for you inside.

364
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,150
我把蓝仔带走
I'll take Blue Jeans, put him away.

365
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,720
-你不用这么做  -这其实是我的工作
- You don't have to do that. - It's kind of my job.

366
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,400
这个夏天我给你姥姥干活
I've been working for your grandma for the summer.

367
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,590
一般情况下这时候应该有个人说“谢谢”
This is usually about the time someone would say "thank you."

368
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,570
-我本来马上就要说的  -不用了
- I was getting there. - No need.

369
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,040
回见  爱笑的Miley
See you round, Smiley Miley.

370
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,480
还记得吗  他以前就这么叫你  爱笑的Miley
Remember? That's what he used to call you. Smiley Miley.

371
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,770
我记得
I remember.

372
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,790
(Rascal Flatts - Backwards)

373
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,340
#我们坐在那儿聊天  谈到如果一切回转#
We sat there and talked about how it would be.

374
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,480
#时光倒流  那些事情还能否#
If we could just rewind it all and go back in

375
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,960
#称心如意#

376
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,870
#你的房回来了  你的狗回来了#

377

#你的卡车回来了  你的头发回来了#
You get your truck back, You get your hair back

379
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,920
#你的工作一个接着一个回来了#
Ya get your first and second jobs back

380
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,970
#你前门廊的铃铛叮个铃个铃#
Your front porch swing goin' ding-a-ling-a-ling

381
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,090
#你的珠宝首饰  钻石戒指#
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring

382
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,190
#你的农场  你的粮仓  你的小船  你的摩托#
Your get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley

383
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,280
#你那只叫查理的老猫咪#
That old black cat named Charlie

384
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,880
#有点疯狂  有点凌乱  有点离奇#
It sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd

385
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,090
#倒着放首乡村歌曲  这一切全都归你#
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards

386
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,820
我的Miley回来了

一个购物中心  真的吗
A mall? Really?

518
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,870
如果他们得逞  这里就不再有平坦开阔的土地了
If they have their way, there won't be any open land left.

519
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,540
嘿  Ruby  来一份这个吗  小姑娘
Hey, Ruby. How'd you like one of those, young lady?

520
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,880
-谢谢  -走吧 Miley
- Thank you.  - Come on, Miley.

521
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,440
-这里会有Bloomie's精品百货吗  -我们还有很多事要做
- Would there be a Bloomie's? - We've got work to do.

522
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,980
抱歉
Sorry.

523
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,380
-你看到的就是未来   -谢谢
- You're looking at the future. - Thank you.

524
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,260
我是认真的  这个人的所有一切都让我反胃
I swear, everything about that man irks me.

525
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,270
-早上好  Ruby小姐  -您早
- Morning, Miss Ruby. - Morning.

526
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,130
看来你把小孙女也带上了
See you got your granddaughter with you.

527
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,870
-是啊  没错  -她都长这么大了
- Yeah, sure do. - Ain't she grown some.

528
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,400
吃少喝少居然能有这样的好效果
Amazing what a little food and water will do.

529
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,500
很高兴和您聊天
Nice chatting.

530
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,480
等我们干完这些  也许咱俩可以一块去买点东西
When we finish, maybe you and I can do a little shopping.

531
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,540
去那儿买  谢谢  还是算了
In there? No, thanks. I'm good.

532
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,540
听着  小妞  在家里或许你是Hannah Montana
Look, missy. You may be Hannah Montana back home,

533
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,820
可是在这我们都是穿马裤皮靴的粗人  所以
but here we're britches and boots. And...

534
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,560
如果你还觉得不满意
...if that ain't good enough for you,

535
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,560
那么你大概只好收拾行李走人
maybe you should just pack up and git.

536
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,640
你也许能蒙过你老爸
You might be fooling your daddy,

537
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,830
但你绝对蒙不了我
but you sure as heck ain't fooling me.

538
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,500
好了  抱歉我唠叨这么多
Now, I'm sorry for fussing at you,

539
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,240
不过  我只是觉得如今你有一个
but... I just think you should consider yourself lucky that,

540
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,540
能称之为家的地方  你应该感到幸运
for the time being, you have a place like this to call home.

541
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,670
我确实觉得
I do.

542
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,210
对不起
And I'm sorry.

543
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,740
我知道
I know you are.

544
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,150
来吧
Come on!

545
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,460
-在这里吗  -是的
- Right here? - Yeah.

546
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,090
然后  把这个西瓜切开当样品
Now... slice up this watermelon for samples.

547
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,300
你现在看到的是Crowley牧场的未来
You're looking at the future of Crowley Meadows.

548
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,030
我要把我的火气收起来然后用到合适的地方
I'm going to take this mood of mine and put it to good use.

549
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,430
免费品尝  这个给你  美女
Free samples! Here you go, girls.

550
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,540
Ruby  你想募捐多少次都可以
Ruby, you can have as many fundraisers as you want,

551
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,140
但你阻止不了时代的步伐
but you are not going to stop progress.

552
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,310
我可不会管把Mills水塘变成垃圾场叫做时代的步伐
Turning Mills Pond into a landfill is not what I call progress.

553
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,010
好吧  很显然...
Well, obviously...

554
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,190
我很快就回来
I'll be right back.

555
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,820
-早上好  -早上好
- Morning. - Morning.

556
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,920
呃  你认识这女孩吗
Um, do you know this girl?

557
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,060
当然  Hannah Montana  我又不是山顶洞人
Sure, Hannah Montana. I don't live under a rock.

558
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,130
噢  显然不是  不是
No, obviously not. No, no.

559
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,840
-想吃点试试吗  -就吃一点
- You wanna try something? - A bit of that.

560
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,370
可以
OK.

561
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,340
很棒  很美味
That's very nice. That's delicious.

562
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,540
-我马上回来  -也许她用了另一个名字
- Uh, I'll be right back. - Maybe she used a different name.

563
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,580
-我可不这么想  -总有人知道她住在哪儿
- I don't think so. - Somebody must know where she lives.

564
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,350
-不行 我得走了   -好吧 谢谢
- No. I got to go. - OK. Thank you!

565
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,080
-Miley 来帮我...  -起来
- Miley, help me get this... - Get up.

566
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,080
帮忙把他拉起来  把他弄走
Help him up now. Let's get him out of here.

567
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,020
帮帮这个可怜的人  你还好吗
Help me with this poor man. Are you OK?

568
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,750
-我非常 非常抱歉  -没关系的
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry. - Honey, you are so forgiven.

569
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,230
你人真好  真的很好
You're too kind. No, really.

570
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,030
你年龄正好  你认识Hannah Montana吗
You're about the same age. You know this Hannah Montana?

571
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,730
Hannah Montana  谁不认识Hannah Montana  她很有名
Hannah Montana! Who don't know Hannah Montana? She's famous.

572
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,800
她对每个人都说她来自这个破地方的一个小牧场
She's telling everyone she's from this little patch of nowhere,

573
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,170
可是谁都没见过她
but no one's ever seen her.

574
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,470
我见过她  以前见过  认识她  以前认识
I seen her, saw her, know her, knew her.

575
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,310
-你是第一个  -我认识整个Montana家的人
- You're the first one. - I know all the Montanas-es.

576
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,610
你知道我在哪儿能找到他们吗
Do you know where I could find them?

577
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,240
当然  往镇上南边走5英里
Sure. You go about five miles south of town,

578
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,310
第一个岔路往右拐
turn right at the first crick.

579
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,120
-第二个弯道左拐  -就找到了
- Left at the second crook. - There you are.

580
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,520
找到了
There you are.

581
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,860
-真是非常谢谢  谢谢  -嗯  不用客气
- So thank you. Thank you. - Yeah. Sure.

582
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,490
-保重  -好 谢谢
- Take care. - Yeah. Thank you.

583
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,270
你好
Hello?

584
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,170
你好  有人在吗
Hello, anybody home?

585
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,410
-什么事  -我觉得你更应该问“在哪里”
- What? - A better question would be "where?"

586
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,340
比如说“我的封面故事在哪里”
As in "where's my story?"

587
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,470
对不起  等一下
Sorry, love. Two seconds.

588
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,850
-喂  -爸爸  你在哪儿  也不打电话
- Hello? - Daddy, where are you? You didn't call.

589
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,320
对不起  宝贝  爸爸在工作  等会儿打回去给你
Sorry, darlings. Daddy's working. I'll call you back in two seconds.

590
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,660
要快点  快熄灯了
Hurry. It's nearly lights out.

591
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,060
抱歉  Lucinda  别着急
Sorry, Lucinda. Don't worry.

592
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,790
我保证这篇Hannah Montana的文章会
I guarantee this Hannah Montana story is...

593
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,300
Hannah Montana
Hannah Montana!

594
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,230
真不敢相信  爸爸  很高兴我们给你打了这个电话
I can't believe it! Dad! I'm glad we called you.

595
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,600
难以置信  你见到她了吗
I don't believe this! Have you met her yet?

596
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,940
别吵了  孩子们
Not now, girls!

597
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,070
-请一定要帮我们拿到她的签名  -我快晕过去了
- Please get us her autograph! - I'm going to faint!

598
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,380
谁啊  谁在那尖叫啊
Who's that? What's all that screaming?

599
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,350
-亲爱的  我会再给你打电话的  -爸爸 爸爸 一定要记得
- Darlings, I'll call you back. - Daddy, Daddy, make sure you do!

600
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,040
-抱歉 刚说到哪儿了  -Ozzie 我需要一篇绝对丑闻
- Sorry. You were saying? - Ozzie, I want the dirt!

601
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,150
相信我  我全身都是(丑闻和泥浆同音)
Trust me, I'm all over it.

602
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:58,610
这真是可笑  我也很是可笑
It's kinda funny, so I kinda funny

603
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,300
哦 唱错了
Oh, I messed up. Um...

604
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,370
这真是可笑  我想让可笑走掉
It's kinda funny, so I get funny out

605
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,820
你的脑海里有个声音不停说
There's a voice inside your head saying

606
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,510
你只是...
You just...

607
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,930
你只是赞同了我
You just join me

608
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,960
对不起  别停下  我这就走
Um, I'm sorry. Don't stop. I'm going.

609
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,300
没关系  我只是唱着好玩的
Don't worry about it. I was goofing off.

610
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,770
很高兴你仍然喜欢唱歌
I think it's great you're still doing that singing thing.

611
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,670
唱歌  唱什么歌
Singing thing? What singing thing?

612
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,470
拜托  每个人都知道你最喜欢的就是唱歌
Come on. Everyone knows that's all you ever wanted to do.

613
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,840
而且  你的声音确实很棒
And... you actually got a nice voice.

614
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,770
谢谢  早就有人跟我说过了
Thanks. I've heard that.

615
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,080
那你觉得这首歌怎么样  我写的
What did you think of the song? I wrote it.

616
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,560
-歌  -是啊  我刚刚唱的那首
- Song? - Yeah, that thing I was just singing?

617
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,990
我有说过是我写的吗
Did I mention I wrote it?

618
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,800
听起来大多数音符你都唱对了
And it seems like you got most of the notes right.

619
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,860
所以  很不错啊  Miley
So way to go, Miley.

620
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,900
大多数
"Most"?

621
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,100
-那你为什么不喜欢  -天 我没说过我不喜欢
-So why didn't you like it?  -Jeez, I didn't say I didn't like it.

622
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,170
可你也没说你喜欢
You sure didn't say you did.

623
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,210
-并不是说差  只是不怎么  -好
- It's not bad. It just wasn't... - Good.

624
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,020
没什么内容
About anything.

625
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,920
听不出来你的个性和你的感觉
Doesn't tell me anything about who you are or what you feel.

626
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,590
-你知道我现在的感觉吗  -我能想到
- You know what I'm feeling now? - I've got an idea.

627
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,820
不过抱歉  是你要问的
And sorry, but you asked.

628
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,300
你现在是在忙什么
Why are you bothering with this anyway?

629
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,390
做一笔鸡蛋生意  Ruby和我达成了一个协议
Starting up an egg business. Me and Ruby struck a deal.

630
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,530
我把鸡笼重新建好  我就能去卖那些鸡蛋了
I rebuild the coop, I get to sell the eggs.

631
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,800
重建得干很多活
It's a lot of rebuilding.

632
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,400
你总得从某个地方开始  对吧
Hey, you got to start somewhere, right?

633
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,380
生活就像登山  但是看到的景色总是很美
Life's a climb, but the view is great.

634
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,420
你就只想在Crowley Corners的集市卖些鸡蛋吗
That's all you want to do, is sell eggs in Crowley Corners?

635
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,920
-不然还能卖什么  -我不是那个意思
- Where else am I going to? - That's not what I meant.

636
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,580
我知道你想说什么  你还是不喜欢这里  对吗
I know what you meant. You don't get this place, do you?

637
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,060
-来吧  给马上鞍  -我们要去哪儿
- Come on. Saddle up. - Where are we going?

638
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,160
给你看些  你错过了的东西
To show you... what you're missing.

Shake it out head to toe

773
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,620
#用尽全身力气  我们就要这样跳#
Throw it all together That's how we roll

774
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,530
#-来跳乡村舞  -嘻哈舞#
- Do the hoedown - Throwdown

775
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,040
#-来跳乡村舞  -嘻哈舞#
- Do the hoedown - Throwdown

776
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,160
#-来跳乡村舞  -嘻哈舞#
- Do the hoedown - Throwdown

777
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,230
#用尽全身力气  我们就要这样跳#
Throw it all together That's how we roll

778
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,780
这就是我们的Miley Stewart  各位
Our very own Miley Stewart, people.

779
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:31,020
你胆子真大  敢来这里
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.

780
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,860
抱歉  我以为这是个社区集会
I'm sorry. I thought this was a community event.

781
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,600
社区  你根本就不知道这个词是什么意思
Community. You wouldn't even know what that word means.

782
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,100
但我知道你对这个词的理解已经过时了
Well, I know that your idea of it is a thing of the past.

783
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,280
你们今晚筹集到了多少
How much y'all raise tonight?

784
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,780
一千美元
A thousand dollars?

785
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,080
还是两千
Two thousand dollars?

786
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,780
不管是多少  我都会出双倍
Whatever it is, I'll double it.

787
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,620
我们才不要你的钱
We don't want your money.

788
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,520
好啊  反正到最后也无所谓了
At the end of the day it ain't gonna matter.

789
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,990
就算你举办一百次这样的集会也筹集不到
You can have a hundred of these, you ain't gonna raise the money

790
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,520
足以拯救牧场的钱
it's gonna take to save the Meadows,

791
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,190
除非是甲壳虫乐队来办募捐演唱会
not unless The Beatles show up for a benefit concert.

792
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:10,100
等等  好像难度比较大
Oh, wait. Small problem.

793
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,600
你们早一天接受现实  也就早一天
The sooner y'all accept the inevitable, the sooner we...

794
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,330
Miley认识Hannah Montana
Miley knows Hannah Montana.

795
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,170
-她是谁  -她冲浪时救过她的命
- Who's that? - She saved her life surfing.

796
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:24,510
她们是好朋友  她会来帮我们的  对吧
They're best friends. She could help us out, right?

797
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,380
办一场演唱会  那会筹到很多很多钱
Throw a concert. That would raise a ton of money.

798
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,620
对  就这么办  快打电话给她
Yeah! Yeah! Do it. Yeah. Call her.

799
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,680
那我就打个电话给她
I guess I could give her a call.

800
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:40,700
Hannah Montana认识Miley
Hannah Montana knows Miley?

801
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,140
天啊  是Hannah Montana  我爱你  Hannah
Oh, my gosh! It's Hannah Montana! I love you, Hannah!

802
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,200
天啊  她来了  没想到她真的会来
Oh, my gosh. She's here. I didn't think she'd actually come.

803
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,300
谢谢  谢谢谢谢谢谢  给我一个拥抱  谢谢
Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Give me a hug. Thank you.

804
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,170
太乡村了
So rustic.

805
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,510
-我喜欢 Miley  -谢谢
- I love it, Miley. - Thanks.

806
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,080
这个“明星拯救故乡”的点子太棒了
This whole "pop star saves hometown" angle is genius.

807
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,420
虽然没有棒到好让我原谅你把我扔在纽约
Not so genius that I forgive you for ditching me in New York

808
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,360
还差点让我丢了饭碗  但还是很棒
and almost costing me my job, but genius nevertheless.

809
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,690
你肯定是姥姥了
So you must be Granny.

810
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,300
真可爱  看看这个地方
Adorable. Oh, look at this place.

811
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,770
这实在是太...  怎么说来着
It's just so, um... And, uh...

812
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:00,840
-这里一直都有这种味道吗  -差不多吧
- It always smell like this? - Pretty much.

813
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,070
失陪了
Excuse me.

814
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,810
Lilly  我太抱歉了  你是我最最要好的朋友
Lilly, I am so sorry. You are the best friend I have ever had.

815
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,880
当我想到你可能不会再跟我说话
When I thought you weren't gonna talk to me,

816
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,980
-我可能会永远失去你  -你就是想甩也甩不掉我
- that I might lose you forever... - Hey you couldn't lose me even if you wanted to.

817
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,750
很好  因为我不想
Good, because I don't want to.

818
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,460
另外  抱歉我告诉那个记者了
And... sorry about talking to that reporter guy.

819
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,900
什么  Lilly是你告诉那个记者的  你怎么可以
What? Lilly, you're the one that talked to the reporter? How could you?

820
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,270
嘿 我觉得现在应该是我们互相表达歉意的时间
Hey, I thought this was one of those "you're sorry, I'm sorry" moments.

821
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,460
没有错  我确实很抱歉  
It is, and I am.

822
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,430
我发誓再也不会让Hannah影响到我们的友谊
And I swear Hannah'll never come between us again.

823
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,500
好
OK.

824
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,010
-Miley  -什么
- Miley? - Yeah?

825
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,600
我能进去跟你和Hannah谈谈吗
Could I come in and talk to you and Hannah for a minute?

826
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,480
-你来当Hannah  -不  你来当
- You be Hannah. - No, you're Hannah.

827
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,510
-我不行  你来当Hannah  别吵了  -Miley
- I can't. No, you be Hannah. Stop it. - Miley?

828
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,950
有很重要的事
It's kind of important.

829
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,010
-不行  -回去
- No. - Back.

830
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:43,820
别再对我这样
Stop doing this.

831
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,350
住手
Stop!

832
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,720
请进
Come in.

833
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,530
我很抱歉  我不知道
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize...

834
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,130
别担心  这只是小小的放松
No worries. This is just a little de-stressing.

835
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,800
这能帮助Hannah调整时差
It helps with Hannah's jet lag.

836
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,500
时差  但是加州到这里只有两个小时
Jet lag? But California's only two hours...

837
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,000
没错  但是Hannah只从西往东飞
Yes. But you see Hannah only flies west to east,

838
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,960
所以...  她的时间反而变早了  
so... she gains time.

839
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,350
有时她需要绕地球飞一大圈  
She sometimes has to go the long way around.

840
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,780
她其实越来越年轻了
She's actually getting younger.

841
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,620
-你有什么事吗  -啊  是的
- Did you want something? - Uh, yeah.

842
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,050
嗨  Hannah
Hi, Hannah.

843
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:23,120
我是Lorelai  我们都非常感谢你这次能来
I'm Lorelai. And we are just all so grateful that you're here.

844
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,560
那没...
Oh, well...

845
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,360
脚部按摩
Foot massage.

846
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,660
非常洛杉矶
Very L.A.

847
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,570
-Miley 你在上面吗  -他还不知道
- Miley, you up there? - He doesn't know.

848
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,770
Hannah已经来了  他肯定会非常兴奋的
That Hannah's here. He is going to be so excited.

849
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,180
-我去告诉他  -那我继续帮她按摩
- Let me tell him. - I'll take over.

850
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:44,380
不  Hannah把我当成了她的私人...
No. See Hannah considers me her personal, you know...

851
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,580
像这种事情  好吧
There's these things that... Fine.

852
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:50,590
但是不能说话
Hey, but no talking.

853
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:05,360
镇长今天晚上想举办盛大的宴会来欢迎你
So the mayor wants to throw this big bash in your honor this evening.

854
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,200
我还特地为了你让他们空运了龙虾
And I've had lobsters flown in and everything just for you.

855
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,110
希望它们不会有太多时差
I hope they don't get too jet-lagged.

856
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:14,940
总之
Anyway...

857
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,610
爸
Dad!

858
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:20,580
-爸  你在干吗  -帮你姥姥修水槽啊
- Dad, what are you doing? - Fixing your grandma's gutter.

859
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:23,680
帮我扶着梯子  别把南瓜踩坏了
Hold the ladder for me. And don't squish the squashes.

860
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,250
爸  快下来  我有急事  现在立刻下来
Dad please come down. It's an emergency. I need you right now.

861
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,820
那你是同意了
Is that a yes?

862
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:33,460
噢  这实在太棒了  哇
Oh! Oh, that's fantastic. Wow.

863
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,800
Lorelai为什么会在帮Hannah按摩脚
What is Lorelai doing rubbing Hannah's feet?

864
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,740
-严格来说  那是Lilly的脚  -呆在这里
- Technically, they're Lilly's. - Stay.

865
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,230
爸  爸  都安排好了  我已经和Derrick谈过了...
Dad. Dad, we're all set. I talked to Derrick, and...

866
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,240
-他怎么了  -嘘  过来
- What's with him? - Shh. Come here.

867
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,940
嘿  Lorelai
Hey. Lorelai.

868
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,010
-你干吗不让Hannah休  -嘘  她好像睡着了
- Why don't you let Hannah rest... - Shh, I think she's asleep.

869
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,580
可怜的小家伙  要倒时差
Poor thing. Jet lag.

870
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,250
她总是从西部飞到东部
She only flies west to east.

871
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,950
什么  这是我这辈子听到过的最蠢的事了
What? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

872
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,760
某种名人的习惯吧
Some kind of celebrity thing.

873
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,490
但是她同意了  她答应参加镇长宴会
But she said yes. She's coming to the mayor's dinner.

874
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:13,100
我的工作就是把她请过去  而她答应了
It was my job to get her there, and she is coming.

875
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,330
-好极了  -你也会去的  对吧
- Great. - You're going, right?

876
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,880
我不知道
I don't know.

877
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,240
你这是在邀请我吗
Is this you asking?

878
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,450
是啊  我觉得应该算是吧
Yeah. I think it might be.

879
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,150
那么这就是我的答复
Then this is me accepting.

880
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,350
-我觉得他们要接吻了  -太好了
- I think they're gonna kiss. - Yes!

881
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,300
上啊  老爸  上啊  老爸
Go, Daddy! Go, Daddy!

882
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,830
这儿确实有点热啊  我还是把窗子打开吧
Certainly is getting hot in here. I think I'll open up the window.

883
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:51,810
我不想让大明星睡在闷热的屋子里
I don't want her to sleep in a stuffy room.

884
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,640
老爸  老爸
Daddy, Daddy.

885
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,020
哦  Jackson
Oh, Jackson!

886
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,520
你没事吧  当心  梯子
Are you OK? Watch it. Ladder.

887
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,550
你没事吧  我来帮你
Are you all right? Let me help you.

888
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:10,750
我没事  我没事
I'm OK. I'm OK.

889
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,640
这东西尝起来  绿色健康  里面放了什么
These taste... healthy. What's in them?

890
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,600
南瓜
Squash.

891
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:29,300
喔  我正想要个牛仔
Ooh. I want a cowboy.

892
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,980
不好意思  人家已经名草有主了
Sorry. That one's taken.

893
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,210
-真的  -是呀
- Really? - Yeah.

894
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,910
也不算
No.

895
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,080
可能吧  我不清楚  看来我们只能做普通朋友
Maybe. I don't know. It looks like we're going to be just friends.

896
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,850
但他还没见到Hannah呢
But he hasn't met Hannah yet.

897
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,460
来吧
Come on.

898
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,260
那么 Ha...
So, Ha...

899
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,740
Ha...
Ha...

900
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,130
快看呐  是Hannah Montana
Hey, look! It's Hannah Montana!

901
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:04,280
你好  抱歉  我...  没看到你
Oh, hi. Sorry, I... I didn't see you.

She said something about going to the barn and brushing Blue Jeans.

哦  是吗  那么你到这儿来想说什么
Oh, really. Was there something you wanted to say

942
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:22,850
还是要问我什么或者要告诉我什么

943
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,420
嗯  我知道你很快就要回去了

I was wondering if maybe you would like to go to dinner with me this evening.

947
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:40,400
好的 没问题
OK. Sure.

948
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,930
反正我也没别的计划  这主意听起来挺不错的

我不能去是什么意思
What do you mean I can't go?

954

You know what? Then I'll just leave it up to you.

959
