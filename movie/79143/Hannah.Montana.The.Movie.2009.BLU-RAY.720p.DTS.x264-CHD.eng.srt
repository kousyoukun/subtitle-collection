1
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,144
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

2
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,374
What is with all the pushing behind me?

3
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,608
Here you go, girls.

4
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,580
It's Miley Stewart. We've got to get in there.

5
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,347
Our names are on the list.

6
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:31,824
Well, why didn't you say so? In your dreams, sweet cheeks. Next!

7
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,418
- No, no. They're on there. I promise. - We need two.

8
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,259
You are the only pop star I know who can't get into her own concert.

9
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,894
She was just here. I don't know where she went.

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,905
- Stop! - Go!

11
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,675
Somebody, stop those girls!

12
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,579
- Go faster! - I can't! This is a golf cart!

13
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,583
Stop!

14
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,586
Those girls shouldn't be here! They don't have a backstage pass!

15
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,021
- What are you doing? - Stop in the name of Security!

16
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,524
- Watch out! - I need backup!

17
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,085
Call for backup! Whoa!

18
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,120
- Yes! - Yes! Oh!

19
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,704
Stop!

20
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,544
- Please stop! - It's OK. It's OK. They're with me.

21
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,947
Come on. Go, go, go.

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800


23
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,565
Hey.

24
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,171
Dad.

25
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,902
What?

26
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,570
Showtime, baby doll.

27
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,009
- She's on the move. - All right, let's go.

28
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,383
Good luck! Don't mess up!

29
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,222
This way. Follow me.

30
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,196
- Come on. - She's coming right now.

31
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,564
All right, talent's on its way.

32
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,092
- Oh! - You do that every night.

33
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,730
- Love you, Daddy. - I'm loving you right back, darling.

34
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,402
Don't forget it's your turn to do the dishes tonight.

35
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,604
I did them last night.

36
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,103
Don't give me no lip. You're the one that wanted the best of both worlds.

37
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,648
- Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! - Watch your head.

38
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,188
Here we go, everybody! Whoo!

39
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Hannah Montana - The Best of Both Worlds

40
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,100
Oh, yeah.

41
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,800
Come on.

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,200
You get the limo out front

43
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,100
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color

44
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,300
It's really you but no one ever discovers

46
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,500
In some ways you're just like all your friends

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
But on stage you're a star

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,600
You get the best of both worlds

49
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Chillin' out, take it slow

50
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Then you rock out the show

51
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,900
You get the best of both worlds

52
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,300
Mix it all together and you know that

53
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,200
It's the best of both worlds

54
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,900
The best of both worlds

55
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,300
You go to movie premiers

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,100
Hear your songs on the radio

57
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Livin' two lives is a little weird

58
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,100
But school's cool cuz nobody knows

59
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,400
Yeah, you get to be a small town girl

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,300
But big time when you play your guitar

61
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
You get the best of both worlds

62
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Chillin' out, take it slow

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,900
Then you rock out the show

64
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,600
You get the best of both worlds

65
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,601
The best of both worlds

66
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:58,000
You get the best of both worlds

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,500
Mix it all together and you know that

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,900
It's the best of both...

69
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,600
best of both...

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
best of both world

71
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,903
Cut! We'll fix that last bit in post.

72
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,966
That's a wrap, people.

73
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,910
- Hannah, as always, fabulous. - Thank you.

74
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,496
No. It's OK. I'm sorry. I just had to meet you.

75
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,022
I promised my girls I'd say hi to you for them.

76
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,557
- Hi. - Hi.

77
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,730
They even wrote out some questions, if you have a second.

78
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:50,038
Oh, my gosh, this is such a thrill. Do you mind?

79
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,738
- Not at all. - Don't even think about it.

80
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,339
- No, Vita. It's OK. - Nothing about this man is OK.

81
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,440
Hello, Oswald.

82
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,781
Hello, Vita. Looking lovely as ever.

83
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,311
Icky teeth, really? Isn't that beneath even you?

84
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:07,520
<i>Oswald Granger, chief sleaze of Bon Chic magazine,</i>

85
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,460
Britain's most notorious tabloid.

86
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,055
And we would love, with a capital "ove,"

87
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,659
to do a cover feature on the global phenomenon that is Hannah Montana.

88
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,431
And by "feature" he means "career-ending expose. "

89
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,963
"Country girl living her dreams beloved by millions," that's all we got.

90
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,999
That's all you're gonna get. Now get out.

91
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,605
Can't blame a bloke for trying.

92
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,515
How could you even think we have something to hide?

93
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,213
- He didn't see anything, did he? - I don't think so.

94
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,720
Good. Hannah, honey,

95
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,154
you can't talk to anyone unless I'm at your side.

96
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,217
I'm your publicist. You need to concentrate on what you do best

97
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,592
which is singing your scrappy little heart out.

98
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,494
Let me worry about everything else,

99
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,592
like making sure your little secret stays a secret.

100
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,035
Sometimes I wish I could be Hannah all the time.

101
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,936
You and me both, kid.

102
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,409
Out of the way, you jackals. Step aside. Coming through.

103
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,037
That's right, don't touch the pop star. Move aside.

104
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:14,118
<i>...like making sure your little secret stays a secret.</i>

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,391
Secret? What secret? Move your bum, you old cow.

106
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,792
Talk to me, Ozzie, and don't disappoint.

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,001
- Apparently there's a secret. - Good. Because the cover's ready.

108
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,236
I just need the story to go with it.

109
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,873
Find out that secret. She's the most popular teenager in the world.

110
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,078
<i>So I suggest you go out and find me every juicy,</i>

111
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:43,817
sordid detail of Hannah Montana's outrageous, glamorous life.

112
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,187
All right. Line it up, people. We're going to choose new teams.

113
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,030
Dead girl in the middle of the floor. Anybody?

114
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,534
Fabulous news: Beyonce has double pneumonia.

115
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,200
Has to drop out of the New York Music Awards. You're in!

116
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,799
That is great. Not for Beyonce.

117
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,107
I really should call. But, yes! I'm so excited!

118
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,204
What am I gonna sing? What am I gonna wear?

119
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,977
Great minds. The car and the box are already outside,

120
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,076
so Hannah has to do a major shop now.

121
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,519
Last chance. Come on.

122
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,683
Miley? Hello? What about my birthday party?

123
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,625
Minor Hannah emergency. I'll be there, I promise.

124
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,190
Wasn't that fun?

125
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,100
Yeah, but it feels weird having them give me stuff for free.

126
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:34,402
Please. Do you know what a well-placed photo of you shopping is worth?

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,237
You're a star, an icon.

128
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,608
You look at it, touch it, wear it, and the whole world has to have it.

129
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,773
They owe it to you, Hannah. Name it and it's yours.

130
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,375
- Really? - I have so much to teach you.

131
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,320
If she doesn't hurry, you're going to miss your plane.

132
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:56,261
Yeah, that's right, losers! I'm going to college! Tennessee Universi...

133
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,957
- University. - Where is that girl?

134
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,264
- I can't decide. - Decide? No deciding. Too stressful.

135
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,932
Take them all. We'll just add them to the pile. Girls.

136
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,771
Ooh.

137
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,334
Watches. I totally need a new watch.

138
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,369
Is that the time? I can't believe it.

139
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:18,179
We got to go. Eleven messages. Jackson.

140
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,209
Lilly's present. Lilly... would totally love those shoes.

141
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,586
- She will so love these. - I'm sorry. I saw these first.

142
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,821
Can you wrap these for me?

143
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,022
They're for my best friend. She's 16 today.

144
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,997
Funny, they're for my best friend, too.

145
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,294
My best friend is a six and a half.

146
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,665
Funny, my best friend's a six and a half, too.

147
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:55,013
Tyra Banks, that's our only pair.

148
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,935
- Not funny. Do you know who I am? - I know you know who I am.

149
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,000
- So? - So?

150
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,136
- So? - So?

151
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,308
- Give me that shoe. - Get away from me!

152
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:55,013
You know what? If you want it, jump for it. Jump for the shoe, Hannah.

153
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,521
Fine. Gimme!

154
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,587
Got it!

155
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,457
Yes! Yes!

156
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,862
Give me my shoe, lady!

157
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,512
She is so in trouble.

158
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,878
No, you didn't! Hannah Montana!

159
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,456
- Yes! - I appreciate you helping me up,

160
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,020
but I don't appreciate you not helping me with this.

161
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,506
Relax? Are you kidding me? Have you met my dad?

162
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,908
He is not gonna shake off me missing saying goodbye to Jackson.

163
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,571
Give us a smile. You look amazing.

164
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,943
Thank you. We got to go.

165
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,015
Hey!

166
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,887
And I didn't even get the shoes. I am the worst friend in the world.

167
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,592
It's him.

168
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,124
Oswald. Step on it!

169
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,329
I cannot get out of the car looking like Miley,

170
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,667
and I cannot show up at Lilly's party looking like Hannah.

171
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,247
Where are you headed?

172
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,730
Hi! Thank you. Thank you.

173
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,703
Hey, Lilly. What's up?

174
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,969
We've talked about this party since we were, like, 12. Where...

175
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,909
- Hi! How are you? Where are you? - I'm almost there.

176
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,037
She hung up on...

177
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,106
Where are you? Everybody's waiting...

178
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,015
- Sorry, wrong number! - Miley!

179
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,043
Two smoothies, please. Where's Miley? We haven't seen her.

180
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,352
Just spoke with her. She'll be here any second.

181
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,423
Rico, what's this hole at the top of the cake?

182
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,832
It's a high-pressure electro-pneumatic solenoid on it.

183
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:27,328
It's 150 pounds per square inch with a brass safety-check valve.

184
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,605
Then I just hit this button and bam! Sparklers go off,

185
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,239
and a "happy birthday, Lilly" banner shoots out the top of the cake.

186
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,114
Once again... Rico is a genius.

187
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:54,255
Hold it! This is a private event. Guests only! What did I tell you? Stop!

188
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,733
- Smile. - No pictures.

189
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,731
That's what I call a Lilly... Wow.

190
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,573
It's Hannah Montana!

191
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,705
Is that Hannah Montana?

192
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,392
Guys, I'm only here... Wait!

193
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,465
Happy birthday to... I want to say happy birthday to my number one fan, Lilly.

194
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,596
She's over that way. She's over that way.

195
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,709
Happy birthday, Lilly. Happy birthday.

196
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,271
I'm sorry. I had no choice. I'll make it up to you, I promise.

197
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,217
You will never, ever, ever make it up to me.

198
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,313
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,386
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.

200
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,201
<i>Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy.</i>

201
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,868
<i>Uh, you guys know the words to Let's Get Crazy?</i>

202
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,250
All right, then, here we go!

203
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,918
You ready? Here we go.

204
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
Hannah Montana - Let's Get Crazy

205
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,296
<i># Life is just a party so come as you are</i>

206
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,361
<i># Dress it up or dress it down Don't forget your guitar, yeah</i>

207
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,361
Dress it up or dress it down, never forget your guitar

208
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,966
<i># Just be courageous 'Cause style's contagious</i>

209
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,171
<i># Everyone can rock out like a superstar</i>

210
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,079
<i># Let's get crazy Get up and dance</i>

211
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,881
<i># Take a swing, do your thing It's worth taking a chance</i>

212
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,910
<i># Let's get crazy</i>

213
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,855
<i># Yeah, just kick up your heels</i>

214
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,858
<i># Don't miss out Time to shout</i>

215
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:04,124
<i># Always keeping it real Let's get crazy</i>

216
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,256
<i># Crazy</i>

217
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,231
Lilly! Lilly, we got cake!

218
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,436
Hold up. Wait. Birthday Girl, I have some questions.

219
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,139
Is it true Hannah's really 43 years old? She lip syncs? Grew up in Nashville?

220
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,115
More like a cornfield in some place called Crowley Corners.

221
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,174
Really? How do you spell "Crowley"?

222
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,244
It's Lilly Truscott, everybody! Happy birthday.

223
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,778
We got cake over there.

224
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,390
Just like it sounds.

225
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,786
- Lilly! - Oliver? Quick!

226
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,889
Light the cake. We're gonna stop Lilly from leaving.

227
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,867
Cake? No, I'm not ready yet!

228
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,266
Come on! We have cake!

229
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,074
Eww!

230
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,215
Sorry.

231
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,354
Lilly, please pick up.

232
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,588
- Did you see this? - Yeah, I know. It's everywhere.

233
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,192
Isn't it... horrible. Bad Hannah.

234
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,362
She and I need to have a little conversation.

235
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,737
Now? But she's getting ready to go to New York.

236
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,402
Didn't she tell you? There's an amazing opportunity.

237
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,901
Yeah, I know about New York. I got CCed in an e-mail. Not happening.

238
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,143
She and I are flying to Tennessee for her Grandma Ruby's birthday.

239
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,242
Didn't she tell you?

240
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,415
A shoe fight! You got into a stinking shoe fight?

241
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,788
In my defense, I totally saw those shoes first.

242
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:45,024
This is absolutely, T-totally, without a doubt unacceptable.

243
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,931
Which pretty much describes all of your behavior lately.

244
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,333
Standing up your brother? Humiliating Lilly at her own party?

245
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,430
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry, but I can't talk about this now.

246
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,441
I got to go to New York. It's the music awards.

247
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,739
Your grandmother's birthday doesn't matter?

248
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,802
This is totally different and you know it.

249
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,110
Now, Robby. Mr. Ray.

250
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,743
Father Montana, Hannah not going to New York is really not an option.

251
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,380
- Her name is Miley. - Miley'll be back before she leaves.

252
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,255
She's a superstar. I can get her a private jet if she wants.

253
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,886
Yes! I've always wanted one of those.

254
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,327
For gosh sakes.

255
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,793
Fine. You win.

256
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,236
But you heard our superstar. She needs a jet.

257
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,102
- Really? - I like your thinking.

258
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,767
It will take some time to arrange,

259
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,538
but I'll go ahead to New York and set up the meet and greet.

260
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:47,084
Ooh. Next time, you might want to demand a jet with a bigger bathroom.

261
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,219
Why in the heck you getting all Hannahed up?

262
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,422
The Hannah steps off the plane photo op.

263
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,990
The balloons, the limos, the screaming fans.

264
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,469
Like Vita says, "It's all about the publicity. "

265
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,406
Yeah. That Vita's just full of good advice.

266
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,072
Absolutely full of it.

267
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,478
Hello, New York!

268
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,890
Looks like your limo's here.

269
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,265
Ain't she a beaut?

270
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,895
Yee doggies. Tennessee.

271
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,242
Dad, come on.

272
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,974
Yeah, maybe I should've remembered Grandma's birthday.

273
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,744
- I did. - Jackson, not now.

274
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:48,344
Dad! Please, Hannah Montana needs to be walking down the red carpet

275
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,321
in New York in less than three hours.

276
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,518
Miley, all you ever wanted to do was sing.

277
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,255
Hannah let you do that and still have a normal life.

278
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,058
That was the dream, remember?

279
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,627
That's why we created her in the first place.

280
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,898
I don't know what she's about anymore.

281
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,031
- What are you saying? - I think we might be done.

282
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,507
- You can't take Hannah away from me. - Really? Because that's what I'm doing.

283
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,674
No! Stop the truck. I'm not doing this. I want to go home.

284
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,444
Stop the truck!

285
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,263
You are home. Look around you.

286
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,898
Hannah means everything to me.

287
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,000
That right there might be the problem.

288
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,407
You're saying I can never be Hannah again?

289
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,078
Ask me again in two weeks.

290
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,485
Right now let's see if a country girl still exists.

291
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,820
- Two weeks? - Think of it as a Hannah detox.

292
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,951
Take that wig off and get back in the truck.

293
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:06,795
No. I'm not getting back in the truck. No way.

294
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,299
I'm not getting back in the truck, Dad.

295
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:21,039
I'm going to New York whether you like it or not, and I'm not... Whoa!

296
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,077
Give that back, you mangy little...

297
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,984
Look at that. Girl don't even recognize her own horse.

298
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,817
Now that truly is sad.

299
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,219
Blue Jeans?

300
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,962
Meet us at the house. Just about a mile up the road.

301
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,438
Don't forget your suitcase.

302
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,080
In my defense, you do look different.

303
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,715
Did you do something to your tail?

304
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,848
Good boy. All right, now. Help me out.

305
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,687
Hold still.

306
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,988
Blue Jeans!

307
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,288
Blue Jeans!

308
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,238
Ya!

309
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,679
Hi. You all right?

310
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,956
Blue Jeans doesn't really take well to strangers.

311
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,290
Especially not dirty, sparkly ones.

312
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,323
I know. He's my horse.

313
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,763
Miley?

314
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,370
It's me. Travis?

315
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:05,399
Travis Brody? We were in the first grade together.

316
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,708
Me and you went to your Uncle Earl's farm and swam

317
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,806
- and got poison oak all over our... - I remember you, OK?

318
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,377
I also remember you hanging me headfirst down a well.

319
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,547
Yeah. I guess I had a pretty big crush on you back then.

320
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,648
But don't worry about it.

321
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,361
I'm over it.

322
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,658
Good to know.

323
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,663
Don't come around too often anymore, do you?

324
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,466
Often enough.

325
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,440
Only a couple times since your ma died that I've heard about.

326
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,000
So how long are you staying?

327
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,341
- Two weeks. - Ha!

328
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,370
- Good luck with that. - What's that supposed to mean?

329
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,009
Considering what you're wearing

330
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,645
and the fact that you couldn't get back on your horse,

331
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,655
I'm guessing you went California on us.

332
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,750
I have not. You don't know anything about me or California.

333
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,654
Let me guess, celebrities are just regular folk like you and me.

334
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,427
- Some are. - Oh. Uh-huh.

335
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,593
You, uh... you actually know any?

336
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,767
I know Hannah Montana.

337
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,737
Hannah Montana? Really?

338
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,909
Yeah. I...

339
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,571
I practically saved her life surfing the other day.

340
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:19,107
She owes me big time. We're like... We're like best friends.

341
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,619
Huh. Best friends.

342
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,152
They're all waiting for you inside. I'll take Blue Jeans, put him away.

343
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,722
- You don't have to do that. - It's kind of my job.

344
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,401
I've been working for your grandma for the summer.

345
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,925
Ooh.

346
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,599
This is usually about the time someone would say "thank you. "

347
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,578
- I was getting there. - No need.

348
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,044
See you round, Smiley Miley.

349
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,484
Remember? That's what he used to call you. Smiley Miley.

350
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,779
I remember.

351
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,826
I got my Miley back!

352
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,767
Come on, Miley, take the next verse.

353
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,796
Come on.

354
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,143
Get your dog back and your house back...

355
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,482
I want my life back, Dad.

356
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,259
Sorry. Sorry, everybody. Hey.

357
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,693
Happy birthday, Grandma.

358
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,632
Well, I just blew out my candles, and I already got my birthday wish.

359
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,431
Come here, sweet thing. Ohhh.

360
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,997
I have missed you more than you can imagine.

361
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,167
And thank you.

362
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,873
Thank you so much for this. I just love it.

363
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,040
There's only one King,

364
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:35,815
and I have been saving him a place of honor.

365
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,815
How long have you been planning this?

366
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,521
Must have taken you forever to find it.

367
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,029
Apparently, I've thought of nothing else for weeks.

368
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,531
Hurt your grandma's feelings

369
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,056
and a chewed-up wig'll be the least of your worries.

370
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,298
Hey, Uncle Chuck. Listen, it's time for cake.

371
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,034
I'll collect the supper plates, you pass out the forks.

372
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,042
Give you a chance to say hi to a few folks.

373
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,246
- You remember Cousin Derrick. - What's with the rat?

374
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,274
Ferret. Harlow.

375
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,751
- Good to be home. - Yeah.

376
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,617
Got any plates for me?

377
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,719
Do me a favor. Introduce yourself to Lorelai over there.

378
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,220
She's new and a little shy.

379
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,700
You ain't up to your matchmaking again, are you?

380
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,068
- Me? Never. - That's right.

381
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,199
Then I reckon it would be a shame for anybody to feel left out.

382
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,143
- Uh-huh. - Excuse me. Got anything for me?

383
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,745
I don't know. Are you sure you can handle it?

384
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,545
You'd be amazed at what I can handle.

385
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,650
I don't believe we've met. I'm Robby Ray.

386
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,245
- Oh! - Ha!

387
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,586
Told you you'd be amazed.

388
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,022
Yahh!

389
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,494
I got it. It's not that bad, ladies and gentlemen.

390
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,830
Oh, Lord!

391
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,143
- Howdy! - Oh, no.

392
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,779
Oh!

393
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,393
Whee doggies! Great news, everybody.

394
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,819
Elvis is alive and well.

395
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,747
I keep thinking I should change the wallpaper,

396
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,619
but your mom picked this out when she was about your age.

397
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,618
I like it.

398
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,151
You used to like a lot of things about coming to see me.

399
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,360
- Grandma... - It's OK.

400
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,061
I know it's not personal.

401
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,232
- I just miss my Miley. - Why does everyone keep saying that?

402
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,869
Maybe you should be asking yourself that question.

403
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,907
Caterpillar in a tree How you wonder who you'll be

404
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,186
Can't go far But you can always dream

405
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,750
Your daddy used to say that to you every night.

406
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,190
Not so much anymore.

407
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,007
Miley! Rise and shine!

408
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,954
Commence Operation Save Hannah Montana.

409
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,619
Morning! Sleep well? I've been up for hours.

410
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,127
How about I go feed the chickens and grab some eggs?

411
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:48,622
Like I always say, ain't nothin' better than farm-fresh eggs for breakfast!

412
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,363
Who in the Sam Heck was that?

413
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,941
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.

414
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,180
Get away from...

415
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,914
Ahh!

416
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,288
How long you think before she figures out to put down the bucket?

417
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,057
Oh, I'm gonna...

418
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,204
All right. Here we go, one farm-fresh egg.

419
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,740
- Y'all couldn't wait? - Darling, we waited,

420
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,185
but eventually we had to get on with the rest of our lives.

421
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,849
Get yourself cleaned up, honeybee. I'm taking you to the farmers' market.

422
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,919
Yay.

423
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,797
Oh, Robby Ray, my gutters need fixing.

424
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,858
And my truck is making a noise you just don't want to hear.

425
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,267
I'm on it.

426
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,533
If you need any help, talk to the foreman.

427
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,563
Might be down by the vegetable patch.

428
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,040
Gotcha.

429
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,102
But don't go squashing my squashes. They're prizewinners.

430
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,180
Looks like you beat me to it.

431
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,414
Lorelai?

432
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,324
Uh, Ruby didn't... You're the foreman?

433
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,625
- That would be me. - So that means you're living here, too?

434
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,859
You're good at this.

435
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,132
That's me, right over there.

436
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,999
I was looking for a fresh start, and I guess Ruby thought

437
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,668
that both me and the farm could use some looking after, so...

438
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,507
She does like putting things together, that's for sure.

439
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,908
Lorelai. The foreman.

440
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,285
I'll be dang.

441
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,588
All right, you guys.

442
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,094
I'd like to introduce you all to Tammy Wynette.

443
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,860
She is the fastest two-legged animal in the world.

444
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,562
She can't fly, she can't swim, but she sure can...

445
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,566
...bite. Be careful.

446
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,904
We talked about this. Unless you want to see ostrich burgers

447
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,434
on the menu at the snack bar...

448
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,277
I'll take it from here. Go feed Miss Pearl.

449
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,646
No, I hate Miss Pearl.

450
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:57,450
All right, kids. Who wants to see a real live...

451
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,952
...alligator?

452
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,051
Let go!

453
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:18,933
Help!

454
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,242
Ah!

455
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,049
What's with the giant udder?

456
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,154
That is something you don't see in Beverly Hills.

457
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,154
Old Man Crowley died and left the town the meadows,

458
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,061
pretty much everything you can see.

459
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,361
But we don't exactly have enough for the taxes,

460
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,062
so I've been helping organize a fundraiser or two.

461
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:48,401
It's just awful. Developers circling like vultures.

462
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,438
Talking about putting up apartment buildings. Shopping malls.

463
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,444
A mall? Really?

464
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,879
If they have their way, there won't be any open land left.

465
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,546
Hey, Ruby. How'd you like one of those, young lady?

466
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,886
- Thank you. - Come on, Miley.

467
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,448
- Would there be a Bloomie's? - We've got work to do.

468
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,982
Sorry.

469
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,388
- You're looking at the future. - Thank you.

470
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,557
Uh-huh.

471
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,525
Oh.

472
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,264
I swear, everything about that man irks me.

473
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,272
- Morning, Miss Ruby. - Morning.

474
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,137
See you got your granddaughter with you.

475
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,870
- Yeah, sure do. - Ain't she grown some.

476
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,402
Amazing what a little food and water will do.

477
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,508
Nice chatting.

478
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,486
When we finish, maybe you and I can do a little shopping.

479
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,545
In there? No, thanks. I'm good.

480
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,548
Look, missy. You may be Hannah Montana back home,

481
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,824
but here we're britches and boots. And...

482
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,560
...if that ain't good enough for you, maybe you should just pack up and git.

483
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,831
You might be fooling your daddy, but you sure as heck ain't fooling me.

484
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,504
Now, I'm sorry for fussing at you,

485
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,240
but... I just think you should consider yourself lucky that,

486
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,546
for the time being, you have a place like this to call home.

487
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,678
I do.

488
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,219
And I'm sorry.

489
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,749
I know you are.

490
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,158
Come on!

491
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,466
- Right here? - Yeah.

492
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:28,097
Now... slice up this watermelon for samples.

493
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,300
You're looking at the future of Crowley Meadows.

494
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:33,037
I'm going to take this mood of mine and put it to good use.

495
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,438
Free samples! Here you go, girls.

496
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,541
Ruby, you can have as many fundraisers as you want,

497
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,142
but you are not going to stop progress.

498
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,314
Turning Mills Pond into a landfill is not what I call progress.

499
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,015
Well, obviously...

500
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,192
I'll be right back.

501
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,826
- Morning. - Morning.

502
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,929
Um, do you know this girl?

503
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,066
Sure, Hannah Montana. I don't live under a rock.

504
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,134
No, obviously not. No, no.

505
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,840
- You wanna try something? - A bit of that.

506
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,370
OK.

507
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,348
That's very nice. That's delicious.

508
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,547
- Uh, I'll be right back. - Maybe she used a different name.

509
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,583
- I don't think so. - Somebody must know where she lives.

510
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,357
- No. I got to go. - OK. Thank you!

511
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,080
- Miley, help me get this... - Get up.

512
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,083
Help him up now. Let's get him out of here.

513
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,028
Help me with this poor man. Are you OK?

514
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,759
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry. - Honey, you are so forgiven.

515
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,233
You're too kind. No, really.

516
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,035
You're about the same age. You know this Hannah Montana?

517
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,736
Hannah Montana! Who don't know Hannah Montana? She's famous.

518
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,802
She's telling everyone she's from this little patch of nowhere,

519
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,177
but no one's ever seen her.

520
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,478
I seen her, saw her, know her, knew her.

521
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,314
- You're the first one. - I know all the Montanas-es.

522
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,616
Do you know where I could find them?

523
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,318
Sure. You go about five miles south of town, turn right at the first crick.

524
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,121
- Left at the second crook. - There you are.

525
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,525
- There you are. - Oh.

526
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,861
- So thank you. Thank you. - Yeah. Sure.

527
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,490
- Take care. - Yeah. Thank you.

528
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,270
Hello?

529
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,177
Hello, anybody home?

530
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,412
- What? - A better question would be "where?"

531
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:59,348
As in "where's my story?"

532
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,476
Sorry, love. Two seconds.

533
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,853
- Hello? - Daddy, where are you? You didn't call.

534
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,327
Sorry, darlings. Daddy's working. I'll call you back in two seconds.

535
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,660
Hurry. It's nearly lights out.

536
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,793
Sorry, Lucinda. Don't worry. I guarantee this Hannah Montana story is...

537
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,302
Hannah Montana!

538
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,237
I can't believe it! Dad! I'm glad we called you.

539
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,605
I don't believe this! Have you met her yet?

540
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:28,942
<i>Not now, girls!</i>

541
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,073
- Please get us her autograph! - I'm going to faint!

542
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,380
Who's that? What's all that screaming?

543
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:38,354
- Darlings, I'll call you back. - Daddy, Daddy, make sure you do!

544
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,048
- Sorry. You were saying? - Ozzie, I want the dirt!

545
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,158
Trust me, I'm all over it.

546
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,390
Oh.

547
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,303
Oh, I messed up. Um...

548
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,547
Oh...

549
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,960
Um, I'm sorry. Don't stop. I'm going.

550
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,304
Don't worry about it. I was goofing off.

551
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,776
I think it's great you're still doing that singing thing.

552
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,676
Singing thing? What singing thing?

553
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,477
Come on. Everyone knows that's all you ever wanted to do.

554
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,848
And... you actually got a nice voice.

555
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,778
Thanks. I've heard that.

556
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,086
What did you think of the song? I wrote it.

557
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,563
- Song? - Yeah, that thing I was just singing?

558
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,999
Did I mention I wrote it?

559
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,868
And it seems like you got most of the notes right. So way to go, Miley.

560
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,900
"Most"?

561
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:15,109
- So why didn't you like it? - Jeez, I didn't say I didn't like it.

562
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,177
You sure didn't say you did.

563
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,213
- It's not bad. It just wasn't... - Good.

564
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,020
About anything.

565
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,926
Doesn't tell me anything about who you are or what you feel.

566
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,590
- You know what I'm feeling now? - I've got an idea.

567
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,826
And sorry, but you asked.

568
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,301
Why are you bothering with this anyway?

569
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,398
Starting up an egg business. Me and Ruby struck a deal.

570
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,534
I rebuild the coop, I get to sell the eggs.

571
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,804
It's a lot of rebuilding.

572
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:44,405
Hey, you got to start somewhere, right?

573
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,381
Life's a climb, but the view is great.

574
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,422
That's all you want to do, is sell eggs in Crowley Corners?

575
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,927
- Where else am I going to? - That's not what I meant.

576
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,589
I know what you meant. You don't get this place, do you?

577
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,121
Ow. Ow.

578
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,067
- Come on. Saddle up. - Where are we going?

579
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,162
To show you... what you're missing.

580
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,232
Ow.

581
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:41,961
- You're next! - No way! No!

582
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,706
Whoa, whoa! Whoo! Whoo!

583
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:51,870
Yes! We got it!

584
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,966
Ha!

585
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,705
It's cold!

586
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,588
We should get going. We don't want to be late for the fundraiser.

587
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,997
Whoo-hoo! Good job, Daddy!

588
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:03,308
Robby Ray Stewart, everybody. Good to have you back, sir.

589
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,250
- You were so great up there. - Thank you, honey.

590
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,285
What is the matter with him? He's dated before.

591
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,557
Maybe it's starting to mean something again.

592
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,862
We're going to slow it down for this next song, if that's all right.

593
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,706
- What? - She likes you. You like her.

594
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,212
Why do you have to make everything so complicated?

595
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,271
Miley, you just wouldn't unders...

596
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:43,016
- How do you know she likes me? - Because she'd be crazy if she didn't.

597
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,816
You got a good point there.

598
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:48,848
I saw Lorelai go out back. Maybe you can go help her with the empties.

599
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,085
I could try.

600
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,109
Miley? Would you like to dance?

601
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,852
Sorry about that back there.

602
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,758
This trip was always supposed to be about Miley. Not really about me.

603
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,186
Ever think the two might be related?

604
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,167
You're right. Our family's closer than most, more...

605
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,603
Secretive? I've noticed.

606
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,372
So how's she doing?

607
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,004
I have a feeling she...

608
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,943
We are gonna be just fine.

609
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:38,693
Ah!

610
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,437
Thank you.

611
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,743
Miley, it's open mike night. You should give it a try.

612
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,407
No. Wait. It's good. I mean, my dad...

613
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,349
- Come on. It's all about having fun. - No. No.

614
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:58,081
- Travis! - Looks like we got ourselves a taker.

615
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,427
All right, um...

616
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:12,299
If you guys don't mind, I'm gonna add a little hip-hop to this hoedown.

617
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,566
Yeah!

618
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,870
All right, banjo, I'm gonna need you to come on up here.

619
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,810
And where are my girls at? Come on up.

620
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,546

Our very own Miley Stewart, people.

676
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,024
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.

677
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,868
I'm sorry. I thought this was a community event.

678
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:40,603
Community. You wouldn't even know what that word means.

679
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,102
Well, I know that your idea of it is a thing of the past.

680
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,283
How much y'all raise tonight?

681
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,785
A thousand dollars?

682
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,085
Two thousand dollars?

683
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,785
Whatever it is, I'll double it.

684
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,622
We don't want your money.

685
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,526
At the end of the day it ain't gonna matter.

686
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,996
You can have a hundred of these, you ain't gonna raise the money

687
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,522
it's gonna take to save the Meadows,

688
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,194
not unless The Beatles show up for a benefit concert.

689
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:10,104
Oh, wait. Small problem.

690
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,608
The sooner y'all accept the inevitable, the sooner we...

691
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,337
Miley knows Hannah Montana.

692
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:20,177
- Who's that? - She saved her life surfing.

693
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:24,516
They're best friends. She could help us out, right?

694
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:27,387
Throw a concert. That would raise a ton of money.

695
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,621
Yeah! Yeah! Do it. Yeah. Call her.

696
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,685
- Yeah. - Uh...

697
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:37,689
I guess I could give her a call.

698
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,703
Hannah Montana knows Miley?

699
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,148
Oh, my gosh! It's Hannah Montana! I love you, Hannah!

700
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,206
Oh, my gosh. She's here. I didn't think she'd actually come.

701
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:23,303
Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Give me a hug. Thank you.

702
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,174
So rustic.

703
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,517
- I love it, Miley. - Thanks.

704
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,081
This whole "pop star saves hometown" angle is genius.

705
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,425
Not so genius that I forgive you for ditching me in New York

706
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,362
and almost costing me my job, but genius nevertheless.

707
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,694
So you must be Granny.

708
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:53,301
Adorable. Oh, look at this place.

709
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:56,779
It's just so, um... And, uh...

710
00:56:56,813 --> 00:57:00,840
- It always smell like this? - Pretty much.

711
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,075
Excuse me.

712
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,817
I am so sorry. You are the best friend I have ever had.

713
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,881
When I thought you weren't gonna talk to me,

714
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,985
- that I might lose you forever... - Couldn't lose me if you wanted to.

715
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,757
Good, because I don't want to.

716
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,460
And... sorry about talking to that reporter guy.

717
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,904
What? Lilly, you're the one that talked to the reporter? How could you?

718
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,271
I thought this was one of those "you're sorry, I'm sorry" moments.

719
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:28,436
It is, and I am. And I swear Hannah'll never come between us again.

720
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,502
OK.

721
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:32,014
- Miley? - Yeah?

722
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,608
Could I come in and talk to you and Hannah?

723
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,482
- You be Hannah. - No, you're Hannah.

724
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,511
- I can't. No, you be Hannah. Stop it. - Miley?

725
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,955
It's kind of important.

726
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,014
- No. - Back.

727
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,821
Stop doing this.

728
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,351
Stop!

729
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,728
Come in.

730
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,531
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize...

731
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,133
No worries. This is just a little de-stressing.

732
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,802
It helps with Hannah's jet lag.

733
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:03,506
Jet lag? But California's only two hours...

734
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:07,004
Yes. But Hannah only flies west to east,

735
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,884
so... she gains time. She sometimes has to go

736
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,787
the long way around. She's actually getting younger.

737
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,621
- Did you want something? - Uh, yeah.

738
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,058
Hi, Hannah.

739
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:23,122
I'm Lorelai. And we are just all so grateful that you're here.

740
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,566
Oh, well...

741
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,363
Foot massage.

742
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,668
Very L.A.

743
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,574
- Miley, you up there? - He doesn't know.

744
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,775
That Hannah's here. He is going to be so excited.

745
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,180
- Let me tell him. - I'll take over.

746
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,380
No. Hannah considers me her personal, you know...

747
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,581
There's these things that... Fine.

748
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,590
Hey, but no talking.

749
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,301
Mmm-hmmm.

750
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:05,364
So the mayor wants to throw this big bash in your honor this evening.

751
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:10,209
And I've had lobsters flown in and everything just for you.

752
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,111
I hope they don't get too jet-lagged.

753
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:14,941
Anyway...

754
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,614
Dad!

755
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,589
- Dad, what are you doing? - Fixing your grandma's gutter.

756
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,683
Hold the ladder for me. And don't squish the squashes.

757
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,251
Please come down. It's an emergency. I need you now.

758
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,821
- Is that a yes? - Mm-hm.

759
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:33,461
Oh! Oh, that's fantastic. Wow.

760
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,802
What is Lorelai doing rubbing Hannah's feet?

761
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,740
- Technically, they're Lilly's. - Stay.

762
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,234
Dad. Dad, we're all set. I talked to Derrick, and...

763
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,247
- What's with him? - Shh. Come here.

764
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,943
Hey. Lorelai.

765
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,010
- Why don't you let Hannah rest... - Shh, I think she's asleep.

766
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,583
Poor thing. Jet lag.

767
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,254
She only flies west to east.

768
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:02,958
What? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

769
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,763
Some kind of celebrity thing.

770
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:09,499
But she said yes. She's coming to the mayor's dinner.

771
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:13,100
It was my job to get her there, and she is coming.

772
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,338
- Great. - You're going, right?

773
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,884
I don't know.

774
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,249
Is this you asking?

775
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,455
Yeah. I think it might be.

776
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,152
Then this is me accepting.

777
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:38,359
- I think they're gonna kiss. - Yes!

778
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,301
Go, Daddy! Go, Daddy!

779
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,672
Whoo!

780
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,836
Certainly is getting hot in here. I think I'll open up the window.

781
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,813
I don't want her to sleep in a stuffy room.

782
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,644
Daddy, Daddy.

783
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,022
Oh, Jackson!

784
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,523
Are you OK? Watch it. Ladder.

785
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,554
Are you all right? Let me help you.

786
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,759
I'm OK. I'm OK.

787
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,833
Mmm.

788
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:21,640
These taste... healthy. What's in them?

789
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:23,604
Squash.

790
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:29,309
Ooh. I want a cowboy.

791
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,980
Sorry. That one's taken.

792
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,215
- Really? - Yeah.

793
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,915
No.

794
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:40,087
Maybe. I don't know. It looks like we're going to be just friends.

795
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:42,855
But he hasn't met Hannah yet.

796
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,463
Come on.

797
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:54,265
So, Ha...

798
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,743
Ha...

799
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,139
Hey, look! It's Hannah Montana!

800
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:04,283
Oh, hi. Sorry, I... I didn't see you.

801
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,185
I'm Travis. Thanks for coming.

802
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:10,886
Yeah, happy to help. This is Lilly. She's my assistant.

803
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,451
Executive assistant.

804
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,420
Welcome to Crowley Corners.

805
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:19,492
It sure would be nice to have someone to... show us around.

806
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,059
- Real smooth. - What?

807
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:25,598
Look, I really don't think I'm your guy. But nice to meet you.

808
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:28,633
No, go. Go!

809
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,575
So... putting up a satellite dish.

810
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,610
It's a birdbath.

811
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,678
I knew that.

812
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:44,088
Lilly, could you go find the owner of this fine house

813
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,152
and run them through my dietary needs?

814
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,262
Go. Assist.

815
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,297
OK.

816
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,667
So, you and Miley are pretty close, huh?

817
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,004
You have no idea.

818
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,907
You don't have to answer if you think this is too personal,

819
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,381
but you think she'd go out with me if I asked?

820
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:07,973
You want to go out with Miley?

821
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:11,413
No, you'd be a real prize. Don't get me wrong, but...

822
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,589
But Miley...

823
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,718
I can't help but smile when I'm around her.

824
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:23,255
I think about her all the time. And I...

825
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,698
You should go ask her out.

826
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,394
- Really? - Mm-hm.

827
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,707
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to do that right now.

828
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,938
No, no. No. Excuse me.

829
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,947
You can't go in there. She's not home. Miley! She's not home.

830
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,246
She said something about going to the barn and brushing Blue Jeans.

831
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,345
You should go ask her there. Go, go, go! Go. Goodbye.

832
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,417
Go!

833
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,821
- Slow down, hot stuff. - Got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

834
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,362
Miley?

835
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:05,098
Miley! Miley, are you...?

836
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,506
Hey, slacker.

837
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,511
Uh, hey.

838
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,473
I was just talking to your friend, Hannah.

839
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,144
Actually, we were talking about you.

840
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,916
Oh, really. Was there something you wanted to say

841
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,857
or ask me or talk to me about?

842
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,425
Well, I know you're going home soon.

843
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,226
Yeah, I am. That's right, Travis, keep going.

844
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:32,598
Um, well...

845
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:37,004
I was wondering if maybe you would like to go to dinner with me this evening.

846
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,406
OK. Sure.

847
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,934
I don't think I have any other plans, so sounds good.

848
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:46,540
- Cool. - Cool.

849
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:53,618
Cool.

850
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:56,216
Now you're talking. Oh, that is the one.

851
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,591
Yeah, it would be, but she's not going.

852
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,925
What do you mean I can't go?

853
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,362
You're the one that promised Lorelai that Hannah

854
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,595
would be the guest of honor at the mayor's lobster hoo-hah tonight.

855
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,502
- Actually, Lilly did. - Actually, Hannah did.

856
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,027
But I promised Travis.

857
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:13,166
You know what? Then I'll just leave it up to you.

858
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,972
You do whatever you think is right.

859
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,171
But...

860
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,896
It's Hannah Montana!

861
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,939
Can I have your autograph, Hannah Montana?

862
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:56,977
Smile.

863
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,384
- Yeah! - Perfect.

864
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,716
Where's Miley? She should be here by now.

865
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,459
Hon, she's got East Coast-West Nile disease.

866
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,898
- That sucker's traveling. - Yeah.

867
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,469
If everybody could please take their seats.

868
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,633
- Yes, be seated, everybody. - Find their place card there.

869
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:24,840
And let me just say that, honestly,

870
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,178
to have someone of your talents,

871
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:31,050
well, Miss Montana, Hannah, if you will,

872
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:36,548
your offer of a concert tomorrow to save Crowley Meadows from such a sad fate,

873
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:41,859
well, our humble little corner of the world can't thank you enough.

874
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:44,365
And if there's ever anything that myself

875
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,699
or the good people of Crowley Corners can do for you,

876
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,468
anything you need, all you have to do is...

877
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,199
Where did she go?

878
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:59,681
Need. I just need to check on my fans.

879
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,580
Hannah, Hannah...

880
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:07,078
See? But what I really need is I need to go to the bathroom.

881
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:10,251
I need to go. Lilly, come with me. Right now!

882
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,255
Makeup, clothes, it's all in there. Go.

883
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,698
- I'll be right back. Cover for me. - OK.

884
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,698
- OK

885
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,347
Hey.

886
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,785
- Sorry I'm late. - You're not late. I was early.

887
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,758
- I got you these. - Thank you.

888
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,522
You do know you only have one earring?

889
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,029
Trendy L.A. Thing.

890
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,132
- I guess you're going back there soon? - Mm-hm. Yeah.

891
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,038
Uh...

892
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,675
- I'm going to go ahead and jump. - Please jump.

893
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,975
- Well, Miley... - Uh-huh.

894
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,314
Before you leave...

895
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:13,048
...I just...

896
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,489
I really want you to know how I feel about you.

897
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,048
Mm-hm.

898
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:24,096
Um...

899
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,729
Is everything all right?

900
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,763
I really should take this. I'm sorry, it will just be a second. I swear.

901
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,401
I'll probably get better reception in the back.

902
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,003
I got two bars. Three bars.

903
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,175
Four bars!

904
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:43,543
Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah.

905
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:53,452
Huh!

906
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,692
Now that our guest of honor has returned, dig in!

907
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,667
That's a heck of a crawdaddy, isn't it?

908
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:14,973
Oh!

909
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:20,853
So, Hannah, you must have a lot of wonderful stories to tell.

910
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,255
Not really.

911
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,325
I mean there are just so many.

912
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:30,423
But I don't want this evening to be all about me.

913
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:33,799
I mean, everybody's stories are important, right, Jackson?

914
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,066
- Huh? - You just started college.

915
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:39,199
- Tell us about your classes. - Yeah, my classes. Uh...

916
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,334
I really like...

917
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,006
I think my favorite part is...

918
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:50,046
Dad, that your little boy is growing up into a man.

919
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,109
Oh!

920
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,084
Oops, dropped my napkin.

921
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,149
Harlow!

922
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,991
- Harlow! - Ow!

923
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,122
- What are you doing? - Looking for a ferret.

924
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,189
- What are you doing? - Trying to have my first

925
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,700
mature relationship. Now get back up there.

926
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:10,929
Found it.

927
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,213
Um...

928
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:31,654
- I'm having the lobster. - It's not on the menu.

929
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:32,956
Right.

930
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:45,633
Sorry. It's been a weird couple of days, but...

931
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,869
Yeah.

932
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,311
And I think I know some of the things you want to tell me.

933
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,275
Yeah?

934
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:59,310
There are so many things I want to tell you, too, and...

935
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,652
That's just going to have to wait.

936
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,684
I need to go double-check on my lobsters.

937
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:56,242
- Club soda will take that out. - Sit! That's enough.

938
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,576
No one is getting up from this table. No one.

939
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:01,144
Dessert, anyone?

940
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,549
I'm sure you've all heard of baked Alaska.

941
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,678
We give you Tennessee flambe.

942
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,160
Mr. Mayor, I assume that you'd like to say a few final words?

943
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:15,254
Oh, yes, yes.

944
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:19,324
Not many people know that the Tennessee flambe was actually invented by...

945
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,845
Come here.

946
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,905
- Mr. Mayor! - I got you now.

947
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,515
Harlow!

948
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:48,760
We got a fire!

949
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,030
Dang flam it!

950
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:19,990
This has all gone very well. Don't you think?

951
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,568
Sorry, excuse me. Excuse me.

952
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,188
Travis, please let me explain.

953
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,060
Explain what?

954
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,691
That you've been making fun of me?

955
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,668
Laughing at me? Lying to me this whole time?

956
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:39,770
I was honest with you. I told you how I felt.

957
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,800
- And I feel the same way. - No, you don't.

958
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:45,245
Because I would have never treated you like that.

959
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,738
You know what, Miley... Hannah, whoever you are?

960
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,775
We're done.

961
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,117
Travis!

962
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,520
Travis, please.

963
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:23,549
- Did you see? - Yeah, I saw.

964
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,522
Robby Ray, is that you down there? Uh...

965
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,889
Not now, Lorelai. I've got some family stuff going on.

966
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,196
I'm sorry. It's just this whole evening was a disaster.

967
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:40,031
I just organized the whole thing, and then that girl comes in and ruins it.

968
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,059
I don't care if she is here for a big concert.

969
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:45,562
She's got a complicated life. I know it's hard to understand, but...

970
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,270
What's going on, Robby Ray?

971
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:53,077
I really don't have any time for secrets and lies.

972
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:56,744
I don't know if I could be happy with somebody comfortable living in them.

973
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,685
I know. You shouldn't have to be.

974
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,783
I should have told you the truth.

975
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,789
The truth is that...

976
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:12,093
...I just don't have any place in my life for a relationship right now.

977
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,467
There's no room. Miley and me, we've got to sort through some things.

978
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:20,669
And she needs me. And I kind of need to be there for her.

979
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:24,510
I'm sorry.

980
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,142
Well, me too then.

981
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,278
Me too.

982
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,858
Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah.

983
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:23,664
Hey, caterpillar.

984
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:25,666
Thanks.

985
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:27,666
No problem.

986
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:40,510
- Are you mad? - No, I'm not mad. You?

987
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,549
No.

988
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:49,463
- How's the song coming? - I don't know. I'm not sure yet.

989
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:52,260
What's it about?

990
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,460
You.

991
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,930
Me.

992
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:58,663
Us.

993
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,238
Can I hear it?

1022
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,595
Miley!

1023
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,260
- Are you OK? - Don't you know better

1024
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:14,029
than to yell at someone asleep on top of a chicken coop?

1025
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,536
I do now.

1026
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:20,130
Did you do this? Were you out here all night?

1027
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:21,733
Just a little hard work. That's all.

1028
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:25,143
Life's a climb.

1029
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,080
Is it time?

1030
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:34,816
Yeah, it's time.

1031
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,151
Let's go.

1032
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,458
Hey!

1033
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,969
We received a one-thousand-dollar contribution

1034
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:51,700
- from an anonymous benefactor! - We're getting there.

1035
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,367
Oh, hey.

1036
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,400
Isn't it awesome? This is terrific! See you at the concert.

1037
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:13,557
- Coming through. Coming through. - Stay back!

1038
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,530
I'm not the agent, I'm not the manager, I'm the grandma.

1039
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:19,124
- I'm the real deal. - She's OK.

1040
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:25,504
Have a good day, ma'am.

1041
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:30,233
Whew, honey. I had no idea.

1042
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,872
No wonder they hide you away in this camper thingie.

1043
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,508
Whoo! Oh!

1044
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,381
Is it always this crazy?

1045
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:39,285
Always.

1046
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:44,486
Well, I know the getting here was hard, but what you're doing is a good thing.

1047
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:45,959
You should be proud of that.

1048
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,030
I know I am.

1049
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,211
This was my mom's?

1050
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,408
Yeah.

1051
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,410
She'd be proud of you too.

1052
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,584
Yeah.

1053
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:20,990
Thanks.

1054
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:25,958
Um, I'm just gonna put it in here so I can...

1055
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,095
So I can have it in my pocket with my show and everything.

1056
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:31,037
That's good, close to you.

1057
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,604
Thank you. I love you.

1058
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:37,067
I love you, darling.

1059

Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

1060
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,379
Ya! Ya!

1061
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:26,957
Yeah!

1062
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,239
Hannah Montana - Rock Star

1063
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:37,239
Sometimes I walk a little faster

1064
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,299
In the school hallway

1065
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,489
Just to get next to you

1066
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:43,319
Some days I spend a little extra

1067
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,679
Time in the morning

1068
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,079
Dress to impress you

1069
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,709
Guess you don't notice

1070
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:48,979
Guess you don't need this

1071
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,999
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin'

1072
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,829
On the outside shyin' away

1073
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:57,000
On the inside dyin' to say

1074
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:58,839
I'm unusual

1075
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,399
Not so typical

1076
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,429
Way too smart to be waiting around

1077
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:05,009
Tai chi practices

1078
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:06,429
Snowboard champion

1079
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,569
I could fix the flat on your car

1080
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,679
I might even be a rock star

1081
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,690
I might even be a rock star

1082
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,494
I can't do this.

1083
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:43,500
Sorry.

1084
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:56,741
I've loved being Hannah, but I just don't think I can do it anymore.

1085
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,053
At least not here, not with you guys.

1086
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,857
See, this is... this is home.

1087
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,856
This is where I'm from. This is family.

1088
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,994
And there's only so many sacrifices you can ask a family to make.

1089
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,267
The last time I stood on this stage I was six.

1090
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,177
I was...

1091
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:32,651
I was just Miley.

1092
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:42,627
And I still am.

1093
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,106
Hi. It's...

1094
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:01,973
It's me.

1095
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:14,688
I've hurt a lot of people, but... I didn't mean to.

1096
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:18,165
And... if it's not too late...

1097
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,398
...I sure would like a second chance.

1098
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:36,911
I know you all came to hear Hannah, but...

1099
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,488
...if you don't mind, I've written y'all a song.

1100
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:43,547
It's kind of personal.

1101
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,924
It's about what I've learned over the last couple weeks.

1102
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:51,597
Life's a climb.

1103
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:56,601
But the view is great.

Miley Cyrus - The Climb</font>

1105
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:11,000
I can almost see it

1106
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,150
That dream I'm dreamin' but

1107
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:17,350
There's a voice inside my head saying

1108
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:20,490
you'll never reach it

1109
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,600
Every step I'm taking

1110
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,400
Every move I make feels

1111
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,060
Lost with no direction

1112
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,200
My faith is shakin

1113
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:38,510
But I, I gotta keep tryin

1114
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:43,420
Gotta keep my head held high

1115
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,360
There's always gonna be another mountain

1116
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,450
I'm always gonna wanna make it move

1117
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:54,420
Always gonna be an uphill battle

1118
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:57,390
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

1119
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:00,410
Ain't about how fast I get there

1120
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:08,630
Ain't about what's waitin on the other side

1121
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:12,840
It's the climb

1122
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,550
The struggles I'm facing

1123
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:21,500
The chances I'm taking

1124
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,420
Sometimes might knock me down but

1125
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:27,490
No I'm not breaking

1126
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:30,100
I may not know it

1127
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:33,330
But these are the moments that

1128
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,190
I'm gonna remember most, yeah

1129
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:38,800
Just gotta keep going

1130
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:44,980
And I, I gotta be strong

1131
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:51,100
Just keep pushing on 'cause

1132
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:54,180
There's always gonna be another mountain

1133
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,140
I'm always gonna wanna make it move

1134
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:00,130
Always gonna be an uphill battle

1135
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:03,070
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

1136
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:06,050
Ain't about how fast I get there

1137
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:14,070
Ain't about what's waitin on the other side

1138
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:18,820
It's the climb

1139
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:41,840
There's always gonna be another mountain

1140
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,920
I'm always gonna wanna make it move

1141
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,680
Always gonna be an uphill battle

1142
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,800
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

1143
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,720
Ain't about how fast I get there

1144
01:30:53,720 --> 01:31:01,890
Ain't about what's waitin on the other side

1145
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:06,120
It's the climb

1146
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,600
Keep on moving

1147
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,110
Keep climbing

1148
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:18,570
Keep the faith

1149
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,690
It's all about

1150
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:29,020
It's all about the climb

1151
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,500
Keep the faith

1152
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:35,740
Keep the faith

1153
01:32:01,749 --> 01:32:06,186
- Whoo! - Yeah. Whoo!

1154
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,869
Thanks for letting me live my Hannah.

1155
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:29,602
Bye.

1156
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:32,977
Please.

1157
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:35,574
Please be Hannah. We'll keep your secret.

1158
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,721
I'm sorry, I can't. It's too late.

1159
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:43,848
Sure, you can!

1160
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:50,857
Put the wig back on. You'll never have a normal life if you don't!

1161
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:53,526
Hannah's a part of you! Don't let her go!

1162
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:58,799
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

1163
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:25,691
No, please.

1164
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,731
- Somebody, stop him! - Call security!

1165
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,743
Watch it! One more step and I hit "send. "

1166
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,802
- Don't do it. - Sorry, nothing on Earth'll

1167
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:41,144
- stop me from... - Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1168
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:43,047
Phoebe, Clarissa, what are you doing?

1169
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:46,451
This nice lady sorted it all out. Two free tickets.

1170
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:48,284
Upper class. It was brilliant!

1171
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:51,257
I thought the girls'd appreciate a couple of free tickets.

1172
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,055
We too late? She going to sing again?

1173
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:55,460
I can't believe that I'm only one degree away...

1174
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:58,829
Hannah! Hannah! Hannah!

1175
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:01,391
- My gosh! It's Hannah Montana! - It's really her!

1176
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,426
- You're right there! I'm here! - I can't believe it!

1177
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:06,235
I really love you. We're your biggest fans ever, really.

1178
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:08,673
You're not going to destroy their dreams, are you?

1179
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:10,267
That's what Hannah's all about.

1180
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:15,174
- Is that your story? - I must be dreaming! Pinch me!

1181
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:18,083
No, that's not my story.

1182
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:20,713
- Oh, my gosh! - Girls!

1183
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:25,720
<i>- Get this down, Lucinda. - Fire away, Ozzie.</i>

1184
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,955
<i>Bon Chic magazine</i>

1185
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:32,659
is run by a wretched, soulless succubus who preys on the misfortune of others,

1186
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:35,100
and I'm not going to put up with it any longer!

1187
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:37,036
<i>Ozzie! Ozzie! Come...</i>

1188
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:38,368
Think I just quit.

1189
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:44,871
Come on. Let's go out front. I think Hannah's got more songs in her.

1190
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:46,709
Thanks, partner.

1191
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:48,908
<i>- Everybody, stay where you are. - Miley!</i>

1192
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:51,679
<i>We got lots more music for you.</i>

1193
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:55,052
Remember that crush I had on you, and I said I was over it?

1194
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:56,113
Yeah.

1195
01:34:57,925 --> 01:34:59,483
Uh...

1196
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:00,755
Please jump.

1197
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:08,599
So not over it.

1198
01:35:13,808 --> 01:35:15,833
Right on!

1199
01:35:23,808 --> 01:35:28,040


1200
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,140
You wake up, it's raining and it's monday

1201
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:35,410
Looks like one of those rough days

1202
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:40,350
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door

1203
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:44,650
Sometimes you feel like running

1204
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:47,900
Find a whole new life and jump in

1205
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:52,160
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor

1206
01:35:53,390 --> 01:36:00,040
Cause when I'm feeling down and I am all alone

1207
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:05,240
I've always got a place where I can go

1208
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,340
Cause I know

1209
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,810
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes

1210
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:13,030

Miley Cyrus - Hoedown Throwdown</font>

1239
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,040
Pop it, lock it, polka-dot it countrify then hip-hop it

1240
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:51,075
Put your hawk in the sky and move side to side

1241
01:38:51,575 --> 01:38:54,808
Jump to the left, stick it, glide

1242
01:38:55,008 --> 01:38:57,808
Zigzag across the floor shuffle in diagonal

1243
01:38:58,008 --> 01:39:00,508
When the drum hits, hands on your hips

1244
01:39:00,854 --> 01:39:04,257
One-footed 180 twist and then a zigzag, step, slide

1245
01:39:04,292 --> 01:39:07,257
Lean it left, clap three times

1246
01:39:07,628 --> 01:39:11,758
Shake it out head to toe, throw it all together, that's how we roll

1247
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:22,415
And cut it!
