1
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
And they wonder why他们很奇怪为什么我们这些20来岁的人…
those of us in our twenties...

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,700
refuse to work拒绝一周工作80个小时…
an 80-hour week...

3
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,900
just so we can afford那样我们就可以像他们一样买得起宝马车
to buy their BMWs...

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,000
why we aren't interested... 为什么我们对

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,700
in the counterculture他们创造的反对主流的文化没有兴趣…
that they invented...

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,700
as if we did not see them好像我们没有看到他们为了一双跑鞋…
disembowel their revolution...

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,200
for a pair of running shoes. 而丢掉了他们革命的意义。


8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,800
But the question remains... 但还是那个问题:

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,300
what are we going to do now? 我们将要做什么？

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,300
How can we repair all the damage我们该如何平复遗留给我们的创伤？
we inherited?

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Fellow graduates, 毕业班的同学们，答案很简单
the answer is simple.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
The answer is... 答案是…

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
The answer is... 答案是…

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,800
I don't know. 我不知道

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Good save, Lelaina.干得漂亮，莉蕾娜

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,700
I'm not a valedictorian, 我从未做过告别演说，现在却做到电视上去了。
but I play one on TV.

17
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
We all know you slept your way我们都知道整个演说你都是梦游过去的。
to the podium.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,600
My favorite part about
graduating now would be...

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
dodging my student-loan officer
for the rest of my life.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,100
He will be in cahoots...

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
with the Columbia
Record and Tape Company guy...

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,000
who's been after my ass
for years.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,700
Troy Dyer, I brought you back
a souvenir.

24
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Ah...

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,700
You know, you can still go back
next year and graduate...

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,200
still get your BF.A.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh, can I? And then I can hang
this on my rearview mirror...

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,700
to brag to all my good buddies
back home that I graduated.

29
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,300
Well, I through
with the whole life drama.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
Well, I know
this sounds cornball...

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,500
but I'd like to somehow make
a difference in people's lives.

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,100
And I... I would like
to buy them all a Coke.

33
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,100
And you wonder
why we never got involved.

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,600
Three words... November sixteenth
nineteen-ninety...

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,500
Oh, totally drunk
and out of my mind!

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,400
It would have been
a poetic experience...

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
if I weren't such a gentleman,
which I am.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
Just let it go, Dyer.
Surrender the fantasy.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,200
Hey, Sammy,
what's your goal?

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,900
My goal is to...

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,700
Like a career or something.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Lainie, I think the moment
has been appropriately captured.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Would you please take your face
out of the camera?

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,700
Come on.
It's for my documentary.

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,100
Her...

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,500
Documentary.

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Think fast.

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
Here's the deal.

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm going to take Sam
against his will...

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,300
and straighten him out
because I truly believe...

51
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,700
that if we can get two women
on the Supreme Court...

52
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,000
we can get at least one
on you, Sam.

53
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300
I'm Superman.

54
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
-I can fly.
-She's toast.

55
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Aah!

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,800
Quick, Vickie.
What's your social security?

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Uh... 851-25-9357.

58
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Very impressive.

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
It's the only thing
I really learned in college.

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Sometimes I get that
"not so fresh" feeling.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,800
Conjunction junction,
what's your function?

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Hooking up words
and phrases and clauses

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,300
Conjunction junction,
how's that function?

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,800
Got three favorite cars
that get most of my...

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,800
Honey, honey. No, no, no.

66
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,800
Is yours good?

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
It doesn't seem fresh.

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,700
Well, I guess
it's about time...

70
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,000
for me to give you
your graduation present, huh?

71
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Your... gas card.

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,700
I'll pay that bill for one year.

73
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,900
And since Helen Anne's got
herself a brand-new Infinity...

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
we're gonna give you
her old BMW.

75
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,100
You can pick it up
at our house.

76
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,400
-BMW? BMW?
-Yeah.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Tom, didn't you listen
to her speech today?

78
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,500
She didn't want a BMW.

79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Mom, I'll handle this.

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen again...

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,700
to some strange ethical argument
about a damn car.

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
Now, it's got four wheels.
It runs well.

83
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,200
And, little darling,
after you've been...

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,800
in the real world
for a while...

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
you're gonna appreciate
that car.

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,500
Yeah. Just think of all those
starving children in Africa...

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
who don't even have cars.

88
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,200
Troy, does your father
give you gifts like that?

89
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,300
Mom.

90
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, actually, my father's
dying of prostate cancer...

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
so I don't really trouble him
much for gifts.

92
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,400
See, Tom.

93
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,300
You don't want a BMW.
Tell him, Lelaina.

94
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,100
Charlane, she can
make up her own mind.

95
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Dad, don't talk to her that way.
She's not a child.

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,900
Well, she married one.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
What?

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
All right. Excuse me.
Come on, come on.

99
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,300
Mom, Dad, I'll take the BMW...

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,200
until I can afford to buy
a regular car myself, OK?

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
OK, Mom?

102
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,000
Please?

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Mom, please, come on.

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,300
Get a Ford.

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,400
SINGING:
Just to float on the sea

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,100
Find myself on a page of history

107
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You know, as I ride along

108
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I can always hear the song

109
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,100
about you
and where you're meant to be

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,100
Well, you're gonna
tell me the answers

111
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,500
I'll know when you
come back to me

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,500
If we should fall,
love will catch us every time

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,100
I hear you call, I will run

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,300
And if the magic
of the adventure overcomes

115
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,100
We won't cry,
because it could be fun

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Well, I'm gonna
tell you the answers

117
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
You'll know when you
come back to me

118
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,500
Gonna be all right

119
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,100
When you come back to me

120
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,200
Good morning!

121
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
Ha ha ha ha!

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Yes. Good morning,
ladies and... gentleman!

123
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
I see a gentleman
right over there!

124
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,700
Good morning!

125
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
Good morning!
Boy, I tell you...

126
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,500
it is a good morning
with this audience.

127
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,100
Ha! Well, today,
for all you dieters...

128
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,700
guiltless goodies
from chef Skinny Ninny.

129
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Whoa. Mmm!

130
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
And we'll also be visiting
with a man...

131
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,100
right here from Houston
who is battling Alzheimer's.

132
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,500
A beautiful
and touching story...

133
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,100
of the triumph
of the human spirit.

134
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,300
He's so cheesy, I can't
watch him without crackers.

135
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,600
Now let's take a peek
inside our "Video View"...

136
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,000
and see what we have
in store for today.

137
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
It's a special report

138
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,900
on children's
birthday party themes...

139
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,400
taped on location...

140
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,500
at 8-year-old
Davy Robbins' party...

141
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,300
exclusively for our
"Video View" collection.

142
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,700
Ha ha ha!

143
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,400
So... come sit with me.

144
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Relax.
Have a cup of joe.

145
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,500
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

146
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Well, anyway, it's gonna be
a good day. Good morning!

147
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,500
You're beautiful.

148
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,400
We're clear.

149
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,300
Am I here to amuse you,
Miss Pierce?

150
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,900
Am I here to make you laugh?

151
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,400
Is that the real reason
I'm on this show?

152
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,900
Mr. Gubler, when I prepare
your note cards...

153
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,400
you're supposed to get
your own espresso.

154
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,900
Didn't you get
my "espress yourself" memo?

155
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,300
I don't have time
for your little mind games.

156
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,900
I'd like to remind you...

157
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
that we're laying people
off around here.

158
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,900
I can find an intern who will do
your job for free like that.

159
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,100
SINGING:
I been locked out

160
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,400
I been locked in

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,400
But I always seem
to come back again

162
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,600
And the view, when I look
from my window...

163
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,900
Oh, that's a much better size.
That looks great.

164
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,900
That would go really well
with the EZ-Fits.

165
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,900
So... Oh, buttoning it up.
That's even better.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, roll 'em right up.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's liberating, isn't it?

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I bought
a toothbrush, some toothpaste

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,400
A flannel for my face

170
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Pajamas, a hairbrush

171
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,200
new shoes, and a case

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,400
I said to my reflection

173
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,500
Let's get out of this place

174
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,500
Past the church and the steeple

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,400
The laundry on the hill

176
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,600
Murder, there's one committed
each 7 seconds.

177
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,700
Hello. I got cut off.
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,500
Tempted by the fruit of another

179
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,400
Waa waa

180
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,900
Hello? What?

181
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,400
Tempted, but the truth
is discovered

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,600
No, no, no.
Listen, he needs us, OK?

183
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,300
If he makes videos,
we show them, OK?

184
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,100
It's symbiotic. It's like
a "chicken or the egg?"

185
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,900
It's both of them
working together.

186
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah, uh-huh.
Well, let me tell you something.

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,400
No, no, no.
I'm not scared of...

188
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,900
Jesus!

189
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
Aah!

190
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
MAN ON TELEPHONE:
Michael, don't laugh at me.

191
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
What?

192
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,000
No, I'm in an accident.
I got in an accident.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Yeah, I'm fine.

194
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
No. I'll call you back,
all right?

195
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm gonna call you...

196
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,600
When you said
you would sue...

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,500
Well, it's not
really my idea.

198
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,900
It's just I got my lawyer guy
telling me, you know...

199
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
something, like,
about my rates or...

200
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,800
Right. You mean, like sue
in a courtroom for money?

201
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't even know...

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,600
because I've never really
done anything like this before.

203
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
I mean, do you have
a lawyer or something?

204
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,000
No, I don't have a lawyer.
I don't have a dentist.

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,500
I'm... You know, I make
four-hundred dollars a week.

206
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,300
What do you do?

207
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, at the moment,
I'm working...

208
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm sorry.
I just... I got to...

209
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,200
Hello.

210
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
Yeah. What is it?

211
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
You know, I don't care...

212
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,100
if she does twelve books
of herself naked, OK?

213
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,200
It doesn't...

214
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
That's Dr. Zaius
from "Planet of the Apes. "

215
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,900
Oh.

216
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm sorry. No.
Someone else is in here.

217
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Yeah? Well, let her
say that to me.

218
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,100
-No, don't do that.
-Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

219
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,900
No, no. You can...
That's all right...

220
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,500
I was... Go ahead.
You want to touch it?

221
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,700
It's all right.
Yeah. No, go ahead.

222
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,600
No, I was talking to...

223
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,400
Look, can I talk to you later?
Can we... When? OK. OK.

224
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,700
Um... OK.

225
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
Um... uh...

226
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,500
You know what?
Just forget it.

227
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,300
Really, just forget
the whole thing...

228
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,100
because it was probably
my fault anyway.

229
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,600
And I'll get in trouble,
and it just doesn't...

230
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
And you seem very sweet.

231
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,800
And you seem to like Dr. Zaius.

232
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
Oh. Ha ha.

233
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,400
-Oh, no.
-That's...

234
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,400
That's... He was just
a collector's... No big...

236
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
Well, we can...

237
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,500
-You know what?
-No, here's his head.

238
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,200
It's really... you know...
I think he's gone.

239
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,400
I'm, like, ruining
your whole life here.

240
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,600
No, no, you're not. Really.

241
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,900
Just don't... Just don't
touch anything else...

242
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,700
and I think we'll be fine.

243
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Michael Grates, vice president
regional programming...

244
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,400
"In Your Face" TV.
We've seen it.

245
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,300
It's like MTV,
but with an edge.

246
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,700
-Yeah. So, is it a date?
-Yeah, yeah.

247
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
-Dinner?
-Coffee.

248
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,700
-Coffee or cappuccino?
-He ended up saying decaf.

249
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Oh, no. Early night.
Is there any precoffee activity?

250
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,100
Um... I don't think so.

251
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,700
Did he ask you to go out
or to hang out?

252
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,100
Go out.
He definitely said go out.

253
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
Hey.
How are you doing?

254
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,000
-Oh, shit.
-What?

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,400
I forgot to tell you something.

256
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Are you out of your mind?

257
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,700
Oh, my god. Lainie, he just got
fired from the newsstand.

258
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,000
He needs a place to stay
till he can find a new job...

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
and get his own place.

260
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Vickie, that's the American
dream of the nineties.

261
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
That could take years.

262
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Look at it like a built-in
security system.

263
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
We'll have a man
around the house.

264
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,100
We'll have a hall monitor.
That's what we'll have.

265
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,600
I don't even know if this is
allowed in the building.

266
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,200
It's not like Mr. Roper's
gonna burst in.

267
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I'll just stay on the couch.

268
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Vickie,
he will turn this place...

269
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,000
into a den of slack.

270
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,600
What the hell is your problem?

271
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
I have to work around here,
and unfortunately, Troy...

272
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,000
you are a master
at the art of time suckage.

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,100
Oh, well, I'm sorry, miss poster
girl for the workers party...

274
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,700
but until I get that toehold
in the burger industry...

275
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,100
I got a little time to suck.

276
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,200
I'd rather check into a shelter
than deal with her shit.

277
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,900
I know how much you
love to mainline in misery here.

278
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,100
But you don't have to.

279
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,100
I can get you a job interview
at my dad's plant.

280
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
What is that?
Part of my lease agreement?

281
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,500
It's either that
or a credit check.

282
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
It's cool, Troy.
You can stay.

283
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,900
Welcome to the maxi pad.

284
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Yeah,
with the new dry-weave...

285
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,700
it actually pulls moisture
away from you. It's good.

286
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
You won't even know
I'm here.

287
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,100
Should I get married?
Should I be good?

288
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
Should I astound
the girl next door

289
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
with my velvet suit
and my Faustus hood?

290
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,500
And not take her to movies
but to cemeteries

291
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
and tell her of werewolf tongues
and forked clarinets?

292
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
What
"Hey, That's My Bike"...

293
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,100
would like to do eventually.
as a band...

294
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,300
is travel the countryside
like Woody Guthrie.

295
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,200
Or Richard Simmons.

296
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,100
You know how,
in his commercials...

297
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,900
how he travels around,
surprises people jogging.

298
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,600
As you can see,
I have the occasional run-in...

299
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,900
with an anti-
"Hey, That's My Biker. "

300
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,100
And to those people,
I say nobody...

301
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,400
Nobody can eat fifty eggs.

302
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,700
-Lainie?
-Whatie?

303
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,600
The next time you make
microwave brownies...

304
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,500
I'd really consider
using a microwave.

305
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,900
It's just a thought.

306
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
You know,
I finally figured out...

307
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,800
what your problem is, Dyer.

308
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,600
What's that?
I'm not a Pepper?

309
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,100
You suffer from the philosopher
groupie syndrome.

310
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,600
You're this guy
with, like, a 180 I.Q...

311
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,300
ten units away from
a degree in philosophy...

312
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
and you always fall
for these dumb groupie types.

313
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,100
Now... they are not all dumb.

314
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Most of them
are just very, very depressed.

315
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Do you find me attractive,
sitting here, eating brownies?

316
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
You do. You're strangely
attracted to me right now.

317
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
You're oddly, oddly
attracted to me.

318
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
It turns you on, doesn't it?
You like to watch, don't you?

319
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Come on.
Come on! Aah!

320
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,600
Here. Ha ha ha!

321
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,100
Don't! Come on.
It's not funny. Give it back.

322
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,500
-Give what back?
-Give it back!

323
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Give what back?
Give the brownies back?

324
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,000
-Aah!
-Brownies, brownies.

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, I love brownies.
My name's Lelaina.

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Hey, don't!
Hey, watch the camera.

327
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,300
Don't throw it at me.
That's not nice.

328
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,200
Mr. Gubler, do you have time
to take a look...

329
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,700
at what I've done here?

330
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I need my questions.

331
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,200
Oh, well, here's
the research that I did.

332
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,700
You might want to read it...

333
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,300
because this guest has
quite a history in politics.

334
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,200
Just give me my questions.

335
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,300
Excusez-moi.

336
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,300
-You all alone?
-Not anymore.

337
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,900
If I could bottle
the sexual tension...

338
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,700
between Bonnie Franklin
and Schneider...

339
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,600
I could solve
the energy crisis.

340
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,300
Excuse me.

341
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,600
Don't bogart that can... man.

342
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,700
-Are you retarded?
-No. I'm rhyming.

343
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not easy.
Sure, I make it look easy.

344
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,000
You guys
better not be inhaling.

345
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,200
Hi.

346
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,500
Lelaina, Vickie was just
promoted to manager of the Gap.

347
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,000
-Shut up.
-It's not even a big deal.

348
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
The old manager
tried to kill herself...

349
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,600
by eating a whole pot
of poinsettias.

350
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Still, I'm so proud of you.
Wait.

351
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,700
I'll be making four-hundred
dollars a week, though.

352
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
We're never gonna
have rent problems again.

353
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Troy, aren't you excited?

354
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,600
I'm bursting with fruit flavor.

355
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
You guys,
I just thought of something.

356
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,800
I'm manager of the Gap.

357
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,300
I'm responsible
for all those t-shirts...

358
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,100
French-cut, v-necked, ribbed,
what have you.

359
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,400
Dude, I'm in trouble.

360
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
No, you're not, Vick.
I know you can do it.

361
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,800
I just do not understand
why this moment...

362
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
has to be Memorexed.

363
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,900
Sammy, don't you realize?

364
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,800
This is your one opportunity
to play a small part...

365
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,300
in what is destined
to be greatness.

366
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,900
Lainie here
is gonna revolutionize...

367
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,300
"Good Morning, Grant. "

368
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,800
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry!
I had no idea!

369
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,300
Look who's mocking.
All you do around here, Troy...

370
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,800
is eat and couch
and fondle the remote control.

371
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,600
I am not under any orders to
make the world a better place.

372
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Well, then what good are you?

373
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,500
You're a pathological optimist.

374
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
You're pathological.

375
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh, would you two just do it
and get it over with?

376
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,300
I'm starving.

377
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Oh!

378
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,700
Hello. You've reached
the winter of our discontent.

379
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,800
Uh... hold on.
It's some Michael character.

380
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,300
Oh.

381
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,800
-Who's Michael?
-Let's order a pizza.

382
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Lelaina, if we promise
to pay you back...

383
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,300
will you spot us a pizza?

384
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,800
Don't have any cash.

385
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,300
Dominoes takes checks.

386
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,500
OK, great.

387
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,100
OK. Bye.

388
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,900
The owner of Dominoes
supports Operation Rescue.

389
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,300
Oh, please. No one
gives a shit right now.

390
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,400
We're starving.

391
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Oh, wait. Wait.

392
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,200
-Ta-da!
-We're going to eat gas.

393
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,300
Ah!

394
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,400
Who's this Michael guy?

395
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,500
Um...

396
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,900
Hey. Vickie just figured
something out.

397
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
-What?
-Something wonderful.

398
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,400
Ha ha ha! Evian is naive
spelled backwards.

399
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Uh! Could you
turn this up, please?

400
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,800
Please?
You won't be sorry.

401
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
Thank you.

402
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,400
RADIO:... When you gonna give me
some time, Sharona?

403
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Ooh, you make my motor run,
my motor run

404
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,400
Gun it comin' off
of the line, Sharona

405
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,700
Never gonna stop, give it up,
such a dirty mind

406
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,100
Always get it up for the touch
of the younger kind

407
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,900
My, my, my, i, yi, woo!

408
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,600
Hey!

409
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,300
M-m-my Sharona.

410
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
Come a little closer, huh?
Ah, will ya, huh?

411
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Close enough to look
in my eyes, Sharona

412
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,400
Keeping it a mystery,
it gets to me

413
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,800
Running down the length
of my thighs, Sharona...

414
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,600
Good times,
any time you need them, baby

415
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,900
Good times,
ain't no time to be afraid

416
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Thelma's husband Keith has got
vodka hidden in the toilet.

417
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,300
Vodka in the toilet.
That's a good one.

418
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,900
Um... boom boom.

419
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,400
James Dice.

420
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,900
That's a two-parter, man.
You can't do that.

421
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
J.J. works in the chicken shop.

422
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
He works in a chicken shop.
We did that.

423
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
It's the same one
when he has that cape on.

424
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,400
Drink up, man.

425
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,900
You hate to see that
happen to the rookie.

426
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,400
Um... Alderman Davis
judges a...

427
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,800
Oh, my god.

428
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,300
Hi.

429
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,700
Are you a collection agent?

430
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,800
Lelaina!

431
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,700
Oh! Yeah, I'll be right there.

432
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh.

433
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,800
If you ain't
the most hardheaded woman...

434
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,300
Great!

435
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,800
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Oh, it's me!

436
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,300
Willona dates a deaf guy.

437
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,700
-Good one.
-Willona dates a deaf guy.

438
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,300
How about the one
when Gary Coleman comes on...

439
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,800
and he's like the little...
like, guy doing that...

440
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,100
-Yeah, we did that one.
-He was cute, though.

441
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,400
-J.J.'s prom date.
-Gotta go. Gotta go.

442
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,000
-Hey. Hi. Hello. Hi.
-Hi.

443
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,300
Um... everybody, this is Michael.
This is...

444
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,900
Prom date. Prom date. Go.

445
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,400
You know, we should...
We should... Yeah.

446
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,600
So, I'm gonna go.

447
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Bye.

448
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,100
Michael throws a party.
Sammy, let's go.

449
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,700
Lelaina, you know the punishment
for premature evacuation.

450
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,400
Penny! Willona adopts Penny!
Shit!

451
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,700
I'm making
this documentary...

452
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,500
about my friends,
but it's really about...

453
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,100
people who are trying to find
their own identity...

454
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,700
without having any real role
models or heroes or anything.

455
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,300
Wow. That...
That sounds great.

456
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,800
It seems like your friends
would be perfect for that.

457
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
Like, um...
Like that guy Troy...

458
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,300
-Troy, yeah.
-You all done here, sir?

459
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,800
Uh, yeah. yeah.

460
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,300
You don't want to finish that?
Because I can...

461
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,800
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I had a late...

462
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
So, Troy is...
You guys just...

463
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,300
It's like you guys living there,
just the two of you?

464
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,000
No, no, no, no, no.

465
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,500
It's me and Vickie,
but he got fired from his job...

466
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,900
and so he needed a place
to crash for a couple weeks.

467
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,700
They caught him
stealing a Snickers.

468
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,900
He stole a Snickers bar?

469
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
Yeah. Ha ha ha!

470
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,400
Somehow he can rationalize it...

471
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,400
like the establishment
owes him a Snickers.

472
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,800
Right, right.

473
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Well, I mean...
I guess... you know...

474
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,100
You know, you're very beautiful.

475
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,300
I mean... I mean, um...

476
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,400
Seriously, you're...

477
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:36,800
I'm, uh... I'm, uh... not really
good with compliments.

478
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,500
Um... but, uh...

479
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,900
Um... Ha ha!
Are you religious?

480
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,100
Um... Ha ha ha!

481
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,800
Ha ha ha!
I'm sorry.

482
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I guess I'm...
I guess I'm, uh...

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,100
a non-practicing Jew.

484
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,400
Hey, I'm
a non-practicing virgin.

485
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Who's this again?

486
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,900
Frampton.
Peter Frampton.

487
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,400
Frampton...

488
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,900
I can't believe you
don't remember...

489
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,400
"Frampton Comes Alive. "

490
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
That album, like,
totally changed my life.

491
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,300
The most profound, important
invention of my lifetime...

492
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
the Big Gulp.

493
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,200
And because, see...
No, listen.

494
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,700
You get one in the morning.

495
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm talking forty-four ouncer,
not this thirty-two wimpy...

496
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,600
-Wait a minute. Forty four?
-Yeah. Forty-four ounce.

497
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,900
How can you ingest
forty-four ounces of anything?

498
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,400
You get one.

499
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,000
You have your essential vitamins
and nutrients...

500
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,500
for the entire day.

501
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,600
Oh, yeah. Definitely.
I'm sure you're totally covered.

502
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
-You do.
-Well...

503
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,100
I guess it really doesn't
take much to make me happy.

504
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,000
Hey, I'm not
materialistic, either.

505
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,500
I mean, I think I'd be working
even if I wasn't getting paid.

506
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,000
And I don't, like, want to get,
you know... a big house.

507
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I just want, like,
a nice house.

508
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm not into cars and stuff.

509
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,500
I mean, I like my car.

510
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
You're probably not
really not into, like...

511
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,600
expensive, snazzy
Italian suits, either.

512
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
-Oh, come on.
-I'm just kidding.

513
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
-No, no, no.
-I'm just kidding.

514
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
Wait a minute.
I'm not like that.

515
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm really not.
I mean... I mean...

516
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm... I'm... I mean...

517
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,300
I know why the caged bird
sings and everything.

518
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,100
Oh, yeah? Why?

519
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,300
Because he was... in a cage,
and he was...

520
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,500
I don't know.
He had high hopes or something.

521
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,400
OK, I dropped out of school...

522
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,000
before we got to that,
all right?

523
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,500
I should have stayed
in college...

524
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
and got a degree
in astronomy or something.

525
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,400
-Oh, god, I love astronomy.
-Really?

526
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,100
Yeah. I just...
The math, though.

527
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,500
It was the math that just,
like... got me every time.

528
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
I loved astronomy, too,
and I got into class...

529
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,100
and it was like...
it was like...

530
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,500
everything was three-squared
times pi equals the root of pi.

531
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,100
Yeah. And I just wanted
to look at the stars.

532
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,000
-It was so...
-Same here exactly.

533
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I remember being so happy
on the roof of our old house...

534
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,100
just staring up at the stars.

535
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,600
Mmm...

536
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,100
I want to do that again.
I want to just...

537
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,600
look up at the stars
and take the time to...

538
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,700
smell the...

539
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,000
everything.

540
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,200
Because it's like... do you ever
have those moments in life...

541
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,200
where everything is OK?
Do you know what I mean?

542
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,700
Just for, like, one moment,
everything is great.

543
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,600
Not since I graduated, no.
But yeah... yeah.

544
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,600
When you, like, catch yourself
in a moment...

545
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,600
and you're saying, wait,
I'm happy here in the moment.

546
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,200
Right. And then it
just goes away really quickly.

547
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
-Gone.
-It just... It's...

548
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I know I've had
a couple of those, you know.

549
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
I always forget them,
but I know I've had them.

550
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
Oh, me, too.

551
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,000
Like right now... is one.

552
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
Yeah... like now.

553
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
SINGING:
Clouds are stalking

554
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,200
Islands in the sun

555
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Wish I could dry one

556
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,400
Out of season

557
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,700
But don't

558
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,900
Hesitate

559
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,900
'Cause your love

560
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
Won't wait

561
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,900
Hey, hey, hey

562
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,200
Ooh, baby, I love your way

563
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,700
Every day

564
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,700
Want to tell you I love your way

565
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Ooh, ooh, ooh

566
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,200
TROY, Ooh, baby,
I love your way

567
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,700
Every day

568
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,600
I want to be with you
night and day

569
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
Shh!

570
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,700
So, you've been up all night?

571
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,000
I am picking up some
very strange vibes in here.

572
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,700
They're of the...
"I just got laid" variety.

573
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,600
Did he dazzle you...

574
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,500
with his extensive knowledge
of mineral water?

575
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Or was it his in-depth analysis
of Markie Mark...

576
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,400
that finally reeled you in?

577
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,100
I just would have liked
to have been there...

578
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
to watch
how you rationalized...

579
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,800
sleeping with a yuppy-head
cheeseball on the first date.

580
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,200
He's not a yuppy.

581
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,700
He's the reason
why Cliff Notes were invented.

582
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Well, that pales
in comparison...

583
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,400
to the tweaked-out
little skanks you date.

584
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,900
To hell with it.
What do I care?

585
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,500
What do you care?
And why are you acting...

586
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,700
like a jealous boyfriend
all of a sudden?

587
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,100
I am not acting like anything.

588
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,700
I am calmly reading.

589
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,100
God. If something's
bothering you that much...

590
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,400
I wish you could just be man
enough to talk to me about it.

591
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,900
All right, Lelaina.

592
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,000
I am really in love with you.

593
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,100
Is that what you want to hear?
Is it?

594
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,500
Well, don't flatter yourself.

595
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,700
Go to hell.

596
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,100
Since I've been
manager here...

597
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,600
our gross has increased
over twenty percent.

598
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,200
So...
What?

599
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
OK. OK. Um...

600
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,700
I guess I'm proud of that.

601
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,300
Oh, please.
Look at this sweater.

602
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,000
People don't know.
They don't know what it takes.

603
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,400
I've never been
a good example before...

604
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,200
and, um... I've never been good
with responsibility.

605
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,900
So, uh...
I blame my parents, though.

606
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,700
I think I was conceived
on an acid trip.

607
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,700
My parents got divorced
when I was 5 years old.

608
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,200
And I saw my father about
three times a year after that.

609
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,200
And when he found out
that he had cancer...

610
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
he decided to bring me here...

611
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,700
and he gives me
this big pink sea shell...

612
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,200
and he says to me...

613
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
"Son, the answers are all
inside of this. "

614
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,900
And I'm all, like, "What?"

615
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,200
But then I realized
that the shell was empty.

616
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,700
There's no point
to any of this.

617
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,200
It's all just a...

618
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,700
A random lottery
of meaningless tragedy...

619
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,100
and a series
of near escapes.

620
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,700
So I take pleasure
in the details, you know.

621
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,100
A Quarter-Pounder with cheese.

622
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,200
Those are good.

623
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,100
The sky about... ten minutes
before it starts to rain.

624
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,600
The moment where your laughter
becomes a cackle.

625
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,200
And I sit back, and I...
I smoke my Camel straights.

626
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,000
And I ride my own melt.

627
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,300
Come on. Come on.
No lagging.

628
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
The free clinic A.I.D.S. test.

629
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,000
The rite of passage
for our generation.

630
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,300
We're so lucky.
Come on.

631
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,800
So, Vick, why are you
getting tested?

632
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,100
One of my friends
tested positive.

633
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,800
To be on the safe side...
you know.

634
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,300
Vickie Miner.

635
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,100
WOMAN, LOUDER:
Vickie Miner.

636
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,100
You can forget it.

637
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,300
Come on, Grant.
That... It's incredible.

638
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,600
It's junk.
Depressing junk.

639
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,500
You know my rules
for the "Video View"...

640
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,000
light and perky.

641
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,300
Look, Lelaina, maybe I should
talk to Grant alone about this.

642
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Look, she's got real talent...

643
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,300
and I want to put her on staff.

644
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
I will not have
Miss Pierce on staff.

645
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
I will walk out of here
if that happens.

646
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,800
You watch.

647
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,500
OK, calm down.
It's no big deal.

648
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,300
We don't have to have her.

649
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,800
Besides,
having to look...

650
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
at that girl's pointy
little face all day...

651
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
it would make me ill.

652
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
Just get rid of her...

653
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,100
like I asked you to do
in the first place.

654
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,100
...I'll get there.

655
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,800
If I don't know where to go,
I'll get there.

656
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,500
If I don't know...

657
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,400
Ten seconds...

658
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,900
nine, eight, seven...

659
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,300
six, five, four...

660
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,100
Is this a good morning or what?

661
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,500
Ha ha ha! Well, with us today
is Libby Kumbaugh...

662
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,400
the author of this book...
"Mommy, Why Do I Hate Myself?

663
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,100
"Self-Esteem
for Parent and Child. "

664
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,700
-Good morning, Libby.
-Good morning, Grant.

665
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,900
Good morning! Now, Libby...
I'm concerned with self-esteem.

666
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,000
Personally, I've always had
an odd preference...

667
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,400
for very, very young girls.

668
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,500
I...

669
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Being a total prick...

670
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,200
...Iy pear, I...

671
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,700
Why don't we welcome
this audience again, huh?

672
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Good morning!

673
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,900
I make more of a mess
than Ruby does.

674
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Hi. You guys, we have to have
a family meeting.

675
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,300
Something's happened.

676
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,100
Oh, no! They've discovered
Nutrasweet causes you...

677
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,400
to grow a third eye.

678
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,900
Let me just say that
everything's gonna be fine.

679
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,500
Yeah,
it's not a big deal.

680
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,000
She'll just wear
a patch over it.

681
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,400
I'm working out a plan.

682
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,900
Yeah, there's
a surgeon in Paris.

683
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,400
He'll just remove it
for free.

684
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,900
-Just don't panic.
-It's not contagious.

685
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,300
Would you shut up?
I just got fired.

686
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Yeah.

687
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,400
Oh, my god.
What happened?

688
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,000
You got fired?

689
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I mean, that just screws up
my whole idea of good and evil.

690
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,200
It's not like I had
a hysterectomy or anything.

691
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,500
I just... I got fired. I'll find
something else, you know.

692
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

693
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
You're hired.

694
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
I need a part-timer.
You need a job.

695
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,500
That would be so cool.

696
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
It's only, like, five dollars
an hour. No big deal.

697
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,000
But it's a pretty good
opportunity.

698
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
Yeah,
it's a dream come true.

699
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,000
It is.

700
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,500
You know, Vick,
I said I'm working out a plan.

701
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah.
So, what's the plan?

702
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm not gonna work
at the Gap, for Christ's sake.

703
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,500
OK?

704
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
-No. I mean...
-Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

705
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,300
Oh, how stupid of me to try
to drag you down to my level.

706
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,000
-Vickie, you don't do this, OK?
-Shut up.

707
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,400
Come on.
This is just...

708
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,700
You know I didn't mean it.
Vickie.

709
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You see, this is
where Troy was fired...

710
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,500
from his eleventh job.

711
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,000
He was an illustrious
office cleaner.

712
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,500
Now if you'll come
this way, please...

713
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,900
we will continue our short
but happy walking tour...

714
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,100
of the career
of Troy Dyer.

715
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,500
And here we have
the newsstand...

716
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,500
where Troy dared
to ask the question...

717
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Are employee snacks subsidized?

718
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,200
The answer... tragically, no.

719
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,500
In total, he has been fired...

720
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,100
from... yes, count them...
twelve jobs.

721
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,600
Twelve? Ouch.

722
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,100
So you shouldn't feel so bad.

723
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,100
One of these mornings, I'm going
to wake up before noon and...

724
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Ha ha. Yeah, right.

725
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,100
And I'm gonna turn on the TV...

726
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
and there Bryant Gumbel
will be, and he'll say...

727
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,200
"Today we have with us...

728
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,100
"the Pulitzer Prize winning
documentarian Lelaina Pierce.

729
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,000
"Lelaina, after your first film,
Why Barbie Is Bad... "

730
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,100
"You seem to have forgotten
all about...

731
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,700
"your best friend, Troy Dyer. "

732
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
Troy who?

733
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,300
What was that name again?

734
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh, right through the heart.

735
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,600
I'll probably be working
at the Whole Foods...

736
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
playing warehouses...

737
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
hanging around places
like the Radio Shack...

738
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,200
screaming that
I used to know you...

739
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,100
and you'll be there
in the lights...

740
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,900
and you'll be all beautiful
and shit.

741
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,100
Oh, Troy. No, no, no.
That'll never happen.

742
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,100
They would never hire you
at Whole Foods.

743
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,300
You see, Lainie,
this is all we need...

744
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,400
a couple of smokes,
a cup of coffee...

745
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,300
And a little bit
of conversation.

746
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,600
You and me and five bucks.

747
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,100
You got it.

748
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,100
-You know what?
-Hmm?

749
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,000
-No, no, no.
-What?

750
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,300
Troy, I can't. I can't.

751
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
Why not?
You never thought about it?

752
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,600
Well, yes, of course
I have, but I...

753
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,800
But what?

754
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
I can't not be friends
with you, OK?

755
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I don't want that. That's not
what I'm talking about.

756
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm talking about a...
you know, evolving.

757
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,200
I just can't handle
this right now.

758
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,700
I can't evolve right now.

759
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,200
Why not?
Because of Michael?

760
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,600
No.

761
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

762
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,700
My parents got divorced
when I was fourteen.

763
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,800
My dad... the dog...

764
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,200
he remarried six months
after the divorce.

765
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,700
Wow. That's quick.
How did everybody react?

766
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,600
Um... my mom threatened
to kill herself in front of me.

767
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Patty got drunk in her closet...

768
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
every morning
before junior high school.

769
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,400
And you?

770
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,200
Well, um...

771
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,800
Somebody had to remember
to take out the trash...

772
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,300
sign the report cards,
buy the milk.

773
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,800
So, um... that kind of ended up
being me.

774
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,300
I don't want to get married...

775
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,200
because I see
how my parents are.

776
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,700
And they've been together,
like, 26 years...

777
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,400
and they're like brother
and sister at this point.

778
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,100
My mother goes to the bathroom
with the door open.

779
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,700
That's "A."

780
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,500
And "B"...
It's disgusting.

781
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,300
I don't want any part of that.

782
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,700
I want first kisses.
I want passion...

783
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,600
the whole way through.

784
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,100
It's better than having to kiss
your husband's ass all the time.

785
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,600
Yeah.

786
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,700
I think that your documentary...

787
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,500
would be perfect
for "In Your Face. "

788
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,600
-See? Forget it.
-No.

789
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
You're probably thinking more
like, you know...

790
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,200
P B.S. or something.

791
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,600
No. No. You know
what it is, though?

792
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,400
It's that I.. Boy.

793
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,300
OK, when I made this thing...

794
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,800
I kind of made
this promise to myself...

795
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,200
that I wasn't going
to think about...

796
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,600
where it was gonna end up
because I didn't want to...

797
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,200
unintentionally
commercialize it.

798
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,800
No,
I think that's great.

799
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I mean, I think
you should definitely...

800
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,200
not unintentionally
do anything...

801
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,800
that you're
not comfortable with.

802
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
I mean, not that I would
intentionally...

803
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Well, plus
it's not done yet, you know.

804
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,200
Right. I know. I know.
It was just a stupid...

805
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,700
You know... I got to go
to New York on Wednesday...

806
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,700
for this huge
network meeting thing...

807
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,700
which is totally...
God, you would hate it.

808
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,300
I hate it. I just...
I just thought...

809
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,300
that they would freak out
over your tapes...

810
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,700
because they never see anything
that's really smart...

811
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:29,300
and has real...
you know, quality and is...

812
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,200
good, like you and your work...

813
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,200
and I know
I'm being selfish and...

814
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Michael, um...

815
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,700
That is literally, literally...

816
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,000
the nicest thing
that anyone's ever said to me...

817
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
the sweetest thing that anyone's
ever said to me.

818
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,700
So, what are you doing
for the rest of your morning?

819
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
What am...
Oh, what am I doing?

820
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
What am I doing?

821
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,000
Ooh. Well, I have
a job interview.

822
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,200
Lelaina, this thing
is from 1988.

823
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I know. Ha ha ha!

824
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,600
So you're, like...
six years late.

825
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,600
I thought the ad said
that this was a job...

826
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,500
for a production assistant.

827
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,300
Yes. You will be
assisting me...

828
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,300
in the production
of videotapes, all right?

829
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,100
You're going to make
copies for me... many copies.

830
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Oh, is this like a...
like a pirate operation?

831
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Do I look like a pirate to you?

832
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,800
Now, radio
is all instinct, Lelaina.

833
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,200
Do you know where
all the radio comes from?

834
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,600
The gut.
It's all in the gut.

835
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Because when you think
on your feet...

836
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,100
got to go from your gut.

837
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,100
And my gut is telling me
that, uh...

838
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,600
this isn't gonna work out.

839
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,700
Maybe your gut's just saying
you're hungry or...

840
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,900
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's telling me that, uh...

841
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,200
you're overqualified
for this job.

842
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,500
I'm really not that smart.

843
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,500
No offense, sweetie,
but you don't have...

844
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,700
any experience on a newspaper.
You're TV.

845
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,100
Well, I'm trying to make my
transition to print journalism.

846
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,600
Ah. Why?

847
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Well, newspapers are
the last watchdogs...

848
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,100
of our... our government.

849
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,900
They enforce
the checks and balances.

850
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,700
And one half-hour of TV
only adds up to...

851
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,500
OK. All right.

852
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,100
Define irony.

853
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,200
Irony. Uh...

854
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,700
Irony.

855
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,200
It's a noun.

856
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,200
It's when something is...

857
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,700
ironic. It's, uh...

858
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,000
Well, I can't really
define irony...

859
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,700
but I know it
when I see it!

860
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,400
Hey. Hey.

861
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,800
Oh, my god.
I've never been so glad...

862
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
to see anyone
in my entire life.

863
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
This day has been
the biggest nightmare.

864
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
I mean, these
job interviews, Troy...

865
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,800
the word vivisection,
a staggering understatement.

866
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,000
Can you define irony?

867
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,300
It's when the actual meaning
is the complete opposite...

868
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,000
from the literal meaning.

869
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,600
Yeah. My god.

870
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,900
Where were you
when I needed you today?

871
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,800
I... I should go.

872
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,300
Oh, come on. Isn't there
some statute of limitations...

873
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,400
for embarrassing incidents?

874
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,100
Your bravado was embarrassing.

875
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,400
Hey, Troy, come on.

876
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,800
You can stay with me
for one cigarette.

877
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,900
I know you can stay with me
for one cigarette.

878
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,100
You, me, five bucks,
good conversation.

879
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,600
Right?

880
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,700
Lainie...

881
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,800
Troy, you haven't been home
in four days.

882
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,700
I mean, where have you
been sleeping?

883
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,000
I got to go.

884
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,400
Mom, I need to talk to you
about a loan.

885
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,500
Is it for drugs?

886
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,400
No. No, it's not for drugs.

887
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,300
I was f...
I lost my job.

888
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,900
But you shouldn't have
any trouble...

889
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,500
finding another job,
sugar bugger.

890
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,200
No. See, I tried.

891
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,900
I applied for every single
opening in my field...

892
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,200
but there's just...
There's nothing right now.

893
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,400
Hmm. Well...
then I hate to say it but...

894
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,200
times are hard.

895
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,100
You're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

896
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,900
Why don't you get a job
at Burgerama? They'll hire you.

897
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,000
My lord, I saw on the TV...

898
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,900
they had this little retarded
boy working the cash register.

899
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,400
Because I'm not retarded, mom.

900
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,400
I was valedictorian
of my university.

901
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,000
Well, you don't have to put that
down on your application.

902
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Miss Pierce,
do you have any idea...

903
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,400
what it means to be a cashier
at Wiener Schnitzel?

904
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,200
Yeah. It's, uh... taking orders
and making change, and, uh...

905
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,400
"thank you. "

906
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,100
No. It's a juggling act.

907
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,700
A juggling act? You mean,
like, metaphorically?

908
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,400
No. I mean, you got people
coming at you from the front...

909
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,000
coming at you from the back,
from the sides...

910
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
people at the condiment
exchange...

911
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,100
people at the drive-thru,
kids on bikes...

912
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,500
and they're all
depending on who?

913
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,000
-Me?
-Yeah.

914
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,500
You got time to lean,
you got time to clean, buddy.

915
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,800
All right?

916
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,000
You got to be 150 percent
on your toes...

917
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,600
150 percent of the time.

918
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,500
There you go, sir.
And have a 'tude, wiener dude.

919
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,000
All rightie.

920
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,500
OK. I'm going to throw
a few numbers out at you...

921
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,200
and you put them together in
your head as quick as you can.

922
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,300
-OK?
-OK.

923
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,800
Eighty-five and forty-five. Go.

924
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,200
One... forty?

925
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,100
Nope.

926
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,300
-One... fifty?
-Nope.

927
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,000
-One-sixty?
-It's not an auction.

928
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,700
Miss Pierce, there's a reason
I've been here six months.

929
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,500
WEATHERMAN:
For the entire summertime...

930
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,800
occurring in one day.

931
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Then last night we had
snow reports in Utah.

932
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,300
Today reports of I-70...

933
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,500
Royalton Hotel.

934
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, hi.
Is this the Royalton Hotel?

935
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,500
That's what I said.

936
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh, sorry.
I didn't hear you.

937
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,500
I'm looking for a guest there.
His name is Michael Grates.

938
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,400
Hold one moment, please.

939
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,600
That guest is out.

940
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,500
Would you like
to leave a message?

941
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,700
Oh... no. That's OK.
I'll just try again later.

942
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,000
Thanks.

943
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,600
Hi. I'm Cheryl Goode
and welcome to "Wedgie"...

944
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,100
the world of hip couture.

945
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,600
This week, we're
in south-central Los Angeles...

946
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,600
at the intersection
of Florence and Normandy...

947
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,600
the flashpoint of fashion.

948
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,200
The phattest gangsta trend
will increase your peace.

949
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,100
This bandanna by Donna Karin...

950
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,600
is blue for Crips,
red for Bloods...

951
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,300
and only costs
seventy-five dollars.

952
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,200
Lainie, have you seen
a pack of guitar strings?

953
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,300
I have to bring them
to the club.

954
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,900
You know,
I hope he knows...

955
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,100
that he still has to
pay some rent around here.

956
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,100
I mean... Ha ha.

957
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,900
I don't know where he thinks
he's spending his nights, but...

958
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,800
Do you know?

959
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,300
I'm late for a jean-folding
seminar. Let's locomote.

960
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,100
Now you can call
your own personal psychic...

961
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,200
anytime 24 hours a day...

962
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,300
thanks to the nationwide
Psychic Discovery Network.

963
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,300
You can pick up the phone
and talk directly...

964
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,100
with an established
professional psychic...

965
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,300
in the privacy of your own home.

966
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,300
I was unhappy in my career,
and I needed a change.

967
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,100
But I didn't know what to do.

968
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,100
It's just that nothing
is going down according to plan.

969
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,200
I mean, my best friend...

970
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,700
I feel like I've
lost him forever...

971
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,200
and he was like
my touchstone, you know.

972
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,700
WOMAN ON TELEPHONE:
This man...

973
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,900
does his name start
with the letter "N"?

974
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,700
Because I'm getting
a very strong "N" vibration.

975
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,200
Newsstand.
"N," newsstand.

976
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,700
He used to work
at a newsstand.

977
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,200
Uh-huh.

978
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,700
Oh, god.
This is unbelievable.

979
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,200
Honey,
that's not all I'm getting.

980
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,200
There are people
I know from high school...

981
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,200
who are already married
and having babies.

982
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,300
I mean, babies, OK?

983
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,000
I can't even take care
of a Chia Pet.

984
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,700
Well, honey,
I didn't have kids...

985
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,700
until I was on
my third husband.

986
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,100
Oh, really?

987
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,500
All Geminis.

988
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,800
You know
what I think, Tanell?

989
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,000
I think you still
really love Monty.

990
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,200
Yeah,
you're probably right...

991
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,700
but it don't matter now.

992
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,700
Oh, yes,
it does, Tanell.

993
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,700
I know you're afraid,
but you've got to find him...

994
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,800
and you've got to tell him
how you really feel.

995
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,500
Find him? I got...

996
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,000
Lelaina.

997
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,700
We need to talk to you.

998
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,400
Hold on, Tanell.
Hold on.

999
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,300
I'm on the phone.

1000
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,700
Yeah, I can see that...

1001
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,100
and we have a four-hundred
and six dollar phone bill...

1002
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,400
mainly due to some calls
to a 1-900 number.

1003
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,500
Lelaina,
I'm so seriously troubled...

1004
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Listen, we'd help you
out, but we're broke, too.

1005
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,500
And you know we can't afford
a new deposit...

1006
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,900
if the phone gets shut off.

1007
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,600
Maybe you could borrow
the money from Michael.

1008
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,100
No, Sammy. Jesus.

1009
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,300
Lainie,
what are you doing?

1010
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,000
What are you doing?
You lay on that couch all day.

1011
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,600
Those pajamas
are like your uniform.

1012
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,900
You run up a four-hundred dollar
phone bill.

1013
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,600
You watch TV.
You chain-smoke.

1014
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,500
You don't go outside.
You don't do anything.

1015
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,100
Man, you are in the bell jar.

1016
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:30,100
Look, this is my apartment.
I signed the lease.

1017
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,600
I let you move in here when you
had no job, no money...

1018
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
and you sponged off me
for two months!

1019
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,100
Sponged? Uh-huh.

1020
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,700
And now Miss Big Power Marm...

1021
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,100
Miss "I'm manager
of the Gap now"...

1022
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,200
you think you can just come
in here and push me around?!

1023
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,200
She's not being pushy.

1024
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,900
Sammy, what are you even
doing here? You don't live here!

1025
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,100
Hey, my little
unemployed waif...

1026
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,900
you're the one who's looking
for work now, OK?

1027
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,700
God, you're really
enjoying this, aren't you?

1028
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,100
You're high.

1029
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,700
Why don't you go take a walk
outside and get some fresh air?

1030
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,100
You've been waiting for this
since the day we met.

1031
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,300
Who told you that?
Your psychic partner?

1032
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,600
I'll tell you the problem
with your generation.

1033
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,100
You don't have any work ethic.

1034
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Now, you take your friend Troy,
for example.

1035
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,600
I went out of my way to set up
an interview for him...

1036
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,600
and he didn't even
bother to show up.

1037
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,400
That wasn't his fault.
He asked me to call and cancel.

1038
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,600
And everything was going on.
And it slipped my mind.

1039
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,900
And I'm... sorry, but, you know,
I have a work ethic, dad.

1040
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,500
I have a very strong work ethic,
you know. Ask anyone.

1041
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,300
Then all you got to do
is show some ingenuity, hmm?

1042
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,100
Darling, I love you, and I hate
to break your plate...

1043
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,100
but you got to grow up sometime.

1044
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,100
Now, I want you to go out there
and show me some ingenuity, hmm?

1045
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,200
Let me talk
with you, my baby

1046
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,600
It is bad to say
that maybe

1047
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,900
It is time for you
to say we

1048
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,200
Came to share
a point of view

1049
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Living in the never-never

1050
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,300
Dropping out of here together

1051
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,400
I could spend some time
forever

1052
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,200
With a girl like you,
let me hear you say

1053
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Let's go, ooh

1054
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:33,700
You want to turn it in,
turn it into heaven, yeah

1055
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,500
Let's go

1056
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1057
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,500
You want to turn it in,
turn it into heaven, yeah

1058
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Right here on earth.

1059
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,100
Looking for tomorrow

1060
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,200
Can you see us one day?

1061
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,800
Beg or steal or borrow

1062
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,100
We could live forever

1063
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,400
Never to say never

1064
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,100
You will be for me

1065
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,500
I will fight for you, now

1066
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,400
Let's go

1067
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1068
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,400
You want to turn it in,
turn it into heaven, yeah...

1069
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,800
Well, that solves
our first problem.

1070
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,700
Rent's due this week.

1071
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,600
Well, well.

1072
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,400
Look who finally decided
to grace us with his...

1073
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,300
Presence.

1074
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,700
This is...
This is, uh, Jean.

1075
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,800
Janine.

1076
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,900
Uh, Janine. Janine.
It's a little loud in the club.

1077
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,300
Excuse me.

1078
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,300
Can't stay here, Troy.

1079
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,800
I'm just gonna
pick something up.

1080
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,200
Well...

1081
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Mission accomplished.
Now leave.

1082
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,000
I think maybe
I'm gonna wait...

1083
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,300
Always the mistress
of etiquette, huh, Lainie?

1084
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,800
Just out of curiosity...

1085
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,000
why are you suddenly acting
like a jealous girlfriend?

1086
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,500
All right. We're just
trying to pay bills here, OK?

1087
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,800
So, Troy, if you got
any money...

1088
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,400
Money? Oh, but what's
money to an artist?

1089
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,100
To a philosopher?
It's just green-colored paper...

1090
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,300
that floats in and out
of his life like snow.

1091
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,700
It's nothing you actually have
to, I don't know, work for...

1092
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,000
is it, Troy?

1093
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,600
No, not if you have
daddy's little gas card.

1094
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,100
You shut up!

1095
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,700
You shut up! I busted my ass
to find a job, any job!

1096
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,000
You don't even bother
showing up for interviews!

1097
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,200
What is it that you want
from me? Huh? What is it?

1098
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,700
You want me to get a job
on the line...

1099
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,300
for the next 20 years,
until I'm granted leave...

1100
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,700
with my gold-plated watch
and my balls full of tumors...

1101
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,000
because I surrendered the one
thing that means shit to me?

1102
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,500
Well, honey,
you can just exhale...

1103
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,400
because it's not gonna happen,
not in this lifetime.

1104
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
All right, fine!
You don't want to work, fine!

1105
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,900
Lainie, goddamn it!

1106
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,400
You want to be a band,
then be a goddamn band!

1107
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,900
Rehearse every day!
Play every night!

1108
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,400
Play three times a night!

1109
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,400
Don't just dick around the same
coffeehouse for five years!

1110
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Don't dick around
with her or with me.

1111
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
I mean, try at something,
for once in your life!

1112
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Do something about it,
but you know what?

1113
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,000
You better do it now,
and you better do it fast...

1114
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,500
because the world
doesn't owe you any favors...

1115
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,000
and whether
you know it or not...

1116
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,200
you're on the inside track
to Loserville, U.S.A...

1117
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,500
just like him.

1118
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,900
OK. It's just
too psychotic in here now.

1119
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,400
All right, Lelaina,
let's go for a walk.

1120
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
Fine.

1121
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,000
Come on, man.
Let them go.

1122
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,300
With pleasure, my friends.
With pleasure. Ha.

1123
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,500
"With pleasure"? You know
who I really feel sorry for...

1124
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,000
is that poor girl.

1125
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,200
Oh, how about when he sneaks
his laundry in with ours?

1126
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,300
It's like I'm pulling
that stuff out of the dryer...

1127
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,800
and there's five pairs
of his boxers...

1128
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,300
I just washed unknowingly.

1129
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,100
No, I'll just throw it
back in his face.

1130
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,200
Yeah, like I'm gonna
do his laundry. Yeah.

1131
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,300
He's weird. He's strange.
He's sloppy.

1132
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,400
He's a total nightmare
for women.

1133
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,300
I can't believe
I haven't slept with him yet.

1134
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,200
Do you ever wish
you were a lesbian?

1135
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,200
Don't you think it would be
so much easier?

1136
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,200
Sometimes, but...

1137
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,500
Nah. I couldn't
go through with it.

1138
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,800
I'd start laughing
or something.

1139
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,200
But it's such a shame...

1140
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,300
because I am
so through with men.

1141
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,300
If one more guy
walks out on me...

1142
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,300
I don't even know what.
I swear.

1143
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,400
What are you
talking about...

1144
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,600
Walk out on you?
You walk out on them.

1145
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,000
I've seen you.

1146
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,100
You're out the door
before the condom comes off.

1147
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,600
Listen to me, I'm just
beating them to the punch.

1148
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,800
OK.

1149
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,900
You don't even know
I'm sitting here...

1150
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,400
maybe...

1151
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,700
Probably dying of A.I.D.S.

1152
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,700
And I'm totally alone.

1153
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,300
Vickie...

1154
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,800
Well, uh...

1155
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,500
you're not alone.

1156
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,300
Hey. Look, I'm sorry
for everything I said...

1157
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,700
and I'm sorry
for being such a bitch...

1158
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,800
but I have to tell you,
you're not alone.

1159
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,900
You're not, and you're not
dying of A.I.D.S.

1160
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,900
You don't understand.
Every day, all day...

1161
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,400
it's all that I think about, OK?

1162
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,900
Every time I sneeze...

1163
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,900
it's like I'm four sneezes away
from the hospice.

1164
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,100
And it's like it's not even
happening to me.

1165
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,400
It's like I'm watching it
on some crappy show...

1166
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,700
like "Melrose Place"
or some shit, right?

1167
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,000
And I'm the new character.

1168
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,500
I'm the H.I.V.-A.I.D.S.
character...

1169
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,600
and I live in the building,
and I teach everybody...

1170
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,800
that it's OK to be near me,
it's OK to talk to me...

1171
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,300
and then I die...

1172
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,300
and there's everybody
at my funeral...

1173
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,800
wearing halter tops and chokers
or some shit like that.

1174
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,800
Vickie, stop, OK?
Just stop.

1175
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,000
You're freaking out,
and you know what?

1176
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,100
You're gonna have to deal
with the results.

1177
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,900
Whatever they are, we're gonna
have to deal with them...

1178
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,700
just like we've dealt
with everything else.

1179
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,400
This isn't like
everything else.

1180
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,700
I know that, all right?

1181
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,400
But it's gonna be OK,
you know?

1182
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,100
I know it's gonna be OK.

1183
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,400
"Melrose Place"
is a really good show.

1184
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,000
WOMAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Lelaina Pierce.

1185
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,100
Is there a Lelaina Pierce here?

1186
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,300
Yeah.

1187
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,900
Hello.
Lelaina?

1188
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,200
Ha ha! Hi!

1189
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,900
Look, I had to
call you right away.

1190
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,400
Listen, listen.
Don't kill me, OK?

1191
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,700
What? What?

1192
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,400
I took the tape,
and I showed it.

1193
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,900
No.

1194
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,500
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.
They freaked out.

1195
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,000
They want to buy them.

1196
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,900
-No.
-Yes.

1197
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,700
They liked it?

1198
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,200
No, no. I mean, they, like,
psychotically loved it.

1199
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,800
They want to pay you for it.

1200
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,700
I know this isn't P B.S.,
but is this OK?

1201
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,500
Yes! I was this close to selling
fruit at intersections.

1202
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
Well, don't, all right?
Don't.

1203
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,100
Just hang on, and I'm gonna
get you some money...

1204
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,800
and I'm gonna be down there
in a few days...

1205
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,100
and I just...
I'm just, like...

1206
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,900
I'm thinking about you
every second here.

1207
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,100
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1208
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,600
Hello! Can you hear me now?

1209
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,800
Where are you?

1210
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,100
I'm in a phone booth.

1211
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,200
Why are you
on a cellular phone?

1212
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,700
I don't know.
I have no idea. I'm just...

1213
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,200
Michael, Michael, Michael,
I... I really miss you!

1214
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,500
I really miss you, too.
I love you. Oh! Whoa!

1215
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,500
I mean... I mean...
you amaze me.

1216
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,400
No! You amaze me!

1217
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,100
Hello?

1218
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,700
Can you hear me?

1219
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,800
Michael, I'm losing you.

1220
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,500
I'm gonna call you back.
Wait. What?

1221
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,500
Pay phone outside...
always amazes me.

1222
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,100
Hey.

1223
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,100
"Try me. I'm free. "

1224
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,600
Good mag. Good mag.

1225
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,600
-Negatory.
-Yeah! All right!

1226
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,100
Did you hear that?
Negative!

1227
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,800
Here. Let me see that.

1228
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,500
Hey, hey! All rightie!

1229
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,500
Thanks
for the help, Lainie.

1230
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,500
A celebration zoom.

1231
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,300
OK. Enough.

1232
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,500
-Ma!
-I'm right here, son.

1233
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
-Ma.
-Yeah?

1234
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:55,800
I have to tell you
some... thing.

1235
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:01,100
I am... a... homo... sexual.

1236
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:06,600
Oh, Christ. Is there a support
group that I can join...

1237
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,100
to help me come to terms
with my own homophobia?

1238
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,100
Yes, there is...

1239
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,600
a group which is named
P F L.A.G....

1240
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,500
Parents and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays.

1241
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,500
Oh. Oh. P F L.A.G.

1242
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,800
I'm beginning to like
the sound of that.

1243
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,000
What you've just witnessed here
is a preenactment...

1244
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,800
of events that are
about to take place.

1245
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:43,900
Well... I came out to her, and...

1246
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,800
she's still
a little bit upset.

1247
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,600
But you know...

1248
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,700
You know, I think
the real reason...

1249
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,900
that I've been celibate
for so long...

1250
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,700
isn't really because I'm
that terrified of the big "A"...

1251
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,200
but because I can't really
start my life...

1252
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,700
without being honest
about who I am and...

1253
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,200
SAMMY ON TAPE:
I want to be in there, too.

1254
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,200
I want to feel miserable
and happy and all of that.

1255
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,200
I mean, I...

1256
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,000
I want to...

1257
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,100
I want to be let back
in the house.

1258
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,400
Hello. Oh, hi.

1259
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,700
Um... sorry.

1260
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,700
Just... the door was...

1261
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,900
So I just, um...

1262
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Yeah, she's getting dressed.

1263
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,300
Great.

1264
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,800
I'll just...

1265
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,600
Oh, I, um...
I don't know if she told you...

1266
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,100
but I just came back
from New York...

1267
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,200
with the tapes that she made,
and the stuff of you...

1268
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,400
it's really...
it's really great stuff.

1269
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,700
Really. That whole...
that whole thing about...

1270
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,200
"Nobody can eat all the eggs,"
that was...


1271
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,700
that was really...

1272
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,700
I was quoting
Cool Hand Luke.

1273
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,400
Yeah. That's OK.
I mean... That's... I know.

1274
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,300
It's... I mean... You know...
It's still... It's...

1275
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,900
Hi.

1276
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,300
-Hi.
-Hi.

1277
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,600
What happened
to your normal clothes?

1278
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,700
Wow!
Lelaina, look at you.

1279
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,700
You look...
Where'd you get that dress?

1280
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,800
Oh, um... I don't know.
I just bought it.

1281
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,400
But I think I'm gonna
go change because...

1282
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,800
No, don't.
You look beautiful.

1283
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,100
You look like...
You look like...

1284
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,600
A doily.

1285
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,700
-I'm gonna change.
-No, don't change.

1286
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,000
And don't go thinking
for yourself either, Lainie.

1287
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,100
Hey, what is your glitch, huh?

1288
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,000
My "glitch"?

1289
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,800
You know what?
We're already late.

1290
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,100
No, no, no, no.
Hang on a second here.

1291
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,400
Do you have, like, a problem
with me or something?

1292
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,700
Because if you do, let's just
get this out, all right?

1293
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,400
Seriously, is there, like...
I mean, have I, like, uh...

1294
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,100
stepped over some line in
the sands of coolness with you?

1295
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,900
Because.. Because...
No, no, no. Excuse me...

1296
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,100
if somebody doesn't know
the secret handshake with you.

1297
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,200
There's no secret handshake.

1298
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,900
There's an I.Q. prerequisite,
but there's no secret handshake.

1299
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,300
I... This is... You... No...

1300
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,200
This guy... you've got this whole
thing with the world.

1301
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,000
Don't you? Huh? That's great.
That's really wonderful.

1302
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,700
But guess what.
I'm a human being, OK?

1303
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,600
We're human beings,
people, OK?

1304
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,600
We're not, like, intelligence
quotations or whatever.

1305
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
-Just ignore him.
-No!

1306
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,000
Done.

1307
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,400
Come on. Let's go.
You don't need this.

1308
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,200
You don't know
what she needs.

1309
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,100
I think I know what she needs
in a way that you never will.

1310
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,500
Let's go.

1311
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,900
Baby, tell me
that my love ain't good

1312
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:31,400
I don't treat you right,
I don't do you like I should...

1313
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,000
Listen,
that's got to be back here, OK?

1314
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,500
-Hi.
-Hi.

1315
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,000
So, you ready?

1316
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,900
Well, what's it like?
I mean...

1317
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,600
It's great. It's great.

1318
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,400
I mean, I haven't actually
seen it yet...

1319
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,700
but we had our best guys
working on it...

1320
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,300
and, you know, we just put
some titles on...

1321
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,900
and shaped it a little bit.
It's gonna be great.

1322
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,200
OK.

1323
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,800
OK, OK.

1324
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,300
OK. Thanks.

1325
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,400
OK, everybody,
it's a special night...

1326
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
because, as you know,
we're entering into...

1327
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,900
a new phase
here at the channel...

1328
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,900
real programming.

1329
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,400
And our first step
is this remarkable piece...

1330
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,800
by Lelaina.

1331
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
So hang on, because
this is going to change...

1332
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,500
the face
of "In Your Face. "

1333
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,100
What's this?

1334
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,500
It's just transitional stuff.

1335
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,600
MAN, SINGING:
La la la-la la

1336
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,000
The story of my life

1337
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
We're finished!

1338
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,900
SINGING:
School's out forever

1339
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,200
I am not under any orders to
make the world a better place.

1340
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,900
And you wonder
why we never got involved.

1341
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,600
SINGING:
School's been blown to pieces

1342
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,500
SINGING:
Love can make you weep

1343
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,300
I don't want to get married...

1344
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,700
because I see
how my parents are.

1345
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,900
-My parents got divorced...
-My parents got divorced...

1346
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,700
-When I was fourteen.
-When I was five years old.

1347
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,600
My mother actually goes to
the bathroom with the door open.

1348
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,500
I swore to myself
I'd never get married.

1349
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
I want passion.

1350
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,500
Let's talk about
sex, baby, let's talk about...

1351
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,300
Turns you on, doesn't it?
Brownies!

1352
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,600
Would you two just do it and get
it over with? I'm starving.

1353
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,600
Oh, my god.

1354
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,900
LELAINA, ON VIDEO:
But the question remains...

1355
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,900
How can we repair
all the damage we inherited?

1356
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,100
I was told there'd be
no math on this exam.

1357
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,600
Can I change my answer?

1358
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,000
The answer is simple.

1359
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,300
We're on a road
to nowhere

1360
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,500
Jesus.

1361
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,500
The answer is...
The-the-the answer is...

1362
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,600
Pizza!

1363
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,700
Pizza.

1364
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,300
Pizza. Ha ha.

1365
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,600
Oh...

1366
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,100
-It's, um...
-Yeah, right.

1367
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,200
We're on a road
to nowhere

1368
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,100
But here we go

1369
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,800
Lelaina.

1370
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,700
Lelaina, look. I'm sorry,
all right? I didn't know.

1371
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,700
That was not my work, Michael.
That's not what I did.

1372
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,700
That's not what I want.
It had nothing!

1373
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,700
I can't believe
I trusted you!

1374
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,700
I had no idea!
I didn't see it!

1375
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,200
I mean, look. I guess it was
probably a little slow...

1376
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,700
and they cut it up
a little...

1377
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,700
Cut it up?

1378
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,700
They cut up everything
that meant anything to me!

1379
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,200
I mean, I don't even think
you realize what you've done.

1380
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,200
You don't get it.
You just don't get it!

1381
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
I do get it!
Look. It just...

1382
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
It's, like, you have
this great piece of work...

1383
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
and we have this audience,
these kids...

1384
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
and it's like trying to feed
them meatloaf or something...

1385
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,700
and they don't want to
eat it, right?

1386
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,500
So you have to give them, like,
"Here comes the plane.

1387
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,200
"It's coming into the hangar.
Open up the hangar. "

1388
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,400
But it's still meatloaf.

1389
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,100
It was never meatloaf!

1390
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,700
That's a bad...
I just...

1391
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,200
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

1392
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,700
They were just trying
to market it.

1393
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,200
And I wish I could
be perfect, OK?

1394
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,700
I wish I could be like Troy...

1395
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,700
riding on his melted
cheese sandwich and everything.

1396
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,300
Don't you dare bring Troy
into this.

1397
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,700
Hey, I wish
I could be like him.

1398
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,200
I wish I could live
off of creeds and mottoes...

1399
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,700
and all that shit,
all right?

1400
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,700
But I'm in the real world
here, OK?

1401
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,200
And I have ideals also.

1402
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,100
They're that I...
I care about you...

1403
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,200
and I want
to make you happy...

1404
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,700
and I'm...

1405
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,200
I just...

1406
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,600
Look...

1407
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,100
I'll make them take
the pizza thing out, OK?

1408
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,500
I'm just a bill

1409
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,800
Yes, I'm only a bill

1410
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,800
And I'm sitting here
on Capitol Hill

1411
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,200
Well, it's a long,
long journey to...

1412
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,300
How'd the big premiere
turn out?

1413
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,400
Fine.

1414
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,900
They were just
videotapes, right?

1415
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,600
Who cares? Ha ha.

1416
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,600
I just worked
so hard on them, you know?

1417
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,400
I worked so hard.

1418
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,400
Ah, forget it.
I just sound pathetic.

1419
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,100
No, you don't.
You don't sound pathetic.

1420
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,900
You know, I know
it sounds stupid...

1421
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,400
but it really meant
something to me.

1422
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,400
I know it wasn't gonna,
you know, end world hunger...

1423
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,900
or, you know,
save the planet...

1424
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,300
but it just meant
something to me.

1425
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,400
I just don't...

1426
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,100
Understand why things just can't
go back to normal...

1427
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,400
at the end
of the half-hour...

1428
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,800
like on "The Brady Bunch"
or something.

1429
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,200
Well, because Mr. Brady
died of A.I.D.S.

1430
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,500
Things don't work out like that.

1431
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:59,000
I was really gonna be something
by the age of twenty-three.

1432
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,300
Honey, all you have to be
by the age of twenty-three...

1433
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,100
is yourself.

1434
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,300
I don't know
who that is anymore.

1435
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,700
Well, I do.

1436
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,400
And we all love her.
I love her.

1437
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,900
Uh...

1438
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,500
She breaks my heart
again and again...

1439
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,000
but, uh...

1440
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,000
But I love her.

1441
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,100
I've wanted you like this
for all these years.

1442
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,400
Hey.

1443
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,700
Hi. Ha ha.
Where are you going?

1444
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,700
I have rehearsal.

1445
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,700
At 8:24 in the morning?

1446
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,500
Yeah. Ha ha.

1447
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,600
-So... that's it?
-No.

1448
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,900
No, that's not...
It's not it.

1449
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,200
I just... I, uh...
I have to go.

1450
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:05,700
Got a party mama,
got a cokehead dad

1451
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,900
I'm the ultimate inversion,
the American man

1452
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:22,800
Don't feel good,
but don't feel bad

1453
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,300
It's me, you see, I'm nuthin'

1454
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,300
I ain't left, I ain't right

1455
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,900
I feel so alone

1456
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:40,900
Before I was born,
I was all gone

1457
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,800
Don't even make sense
that I wrote this song

1458
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,100
'Cause...

1459
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,600
Tell me it's not true.

1460
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,800
TROY, SINGING:
It's me, you see, I'm nuthin'

1461
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,800
I'm nuthin'

1462
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,900
Nuthin'

1463
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,500
That's me

1464
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,800
I'm nuthin'

1465
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,300
Lainie, sex is the quickest way
to ruin a friendship.

1466
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,600
Come on.

1467
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,100
Thank you.
We'll be right back...

1468
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,300
with a new American cheese
snack idea.

1469
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,700
You got a phone call.

1470
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,000
Lelaina.

1471
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,200
-Hi.
-Hi.

1472
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,500
Don't say anything, all right?

1473
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,800
Look, I screwed up, all right?
I know.

1474
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,300
I should have protected
you and your work...

1475
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,800
and I didn't,
and I'm sorry.

1476
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,300
I'm so sorry that I didn't.

1477
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,500
And I want to make this
up to you, OK?

1478
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,400
You mean so much
to me, Lelaina...

1479
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,100
and I just...

1480
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,100
Look, two tickets,
all right, New York.

1481
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,900
We go, and we give them
a presentation...

1482
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,700
of the show
the way you want it done.

1483
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,000
Michael, I don't...

1484
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,900
I know. I know,
but this time is different.

1485
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,900
I mean, who's the boss, huh?
Huh? Tony Danza? No.

1486
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,500
I don't think so.
It's you.

1487
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,600
It's your show,
and I just...

1488
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,900
I just... you know,
feel like maybe...

1489
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,400
I deserve another shot here.

1490
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,900
Well, hi, Lelaina.

1491
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,400
Hi.

1492
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,900
What, is there a frog
in your throat...

1493
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,500
or are you just glad
to see me?

1494
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,400
Hi, Mike. Thanks
for coming down, man.

1495
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,000
No hard feelings.

1496
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,600
Lelaina, you're looking
a little peaked.

1497
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,200
Yeah. Are you OK?

1498
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,900
She's fine.
She's fine.

1499
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,600
She's just had
too many Diet Cokes today.

1500
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,100
Yeah, this girl
is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

1501
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,400
Ha.

1502
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,400
So, are you gonna
tell him, or am I?

1503
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,900
Could you excuse me?
Could I talk to you?

1504
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,200
Hi.

1505
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,900
You want to tell me what
the hell he's doing here?

1506
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,100
I wanted to talk to you.

1507
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,900
What the hell do you care?

1508
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,900
You totally bailed on me
this morning.

1509
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,500
I panicked. It happens.

1510
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,000
I thought we could
work it out, you know.

1511
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,700
I mean, I don't know if now
is the right time for us.

1512
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,500
Look, I meant everything
that I said to you last night.

1513
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,900
Don't look at me like that.

1514
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,400
Don't look at me like that.
That's not what I'm saying.

1515
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,000
I'm not saying I...

1516
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,600
Look, you are the only woman...

1517
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,500
that I could ever
commit myself to.

1518
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,000
So what?
Do I get a medal?

1519
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,100
I win the big commitment
cook-off, and you just run away?

1520
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,000
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew this was gonna happen!

1521
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,100
I don't want to lose you.

1522
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,600
I've never been in an experience
like this before.

1523
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,700
I've never had sex with somebody
that I loved before.

1524
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,600
Oh, well, congratulations,
Troy Dyer.

1525
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,900
Welcome to the world
of the emotionally immature.

1526
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,100
It's a really nice place
to visit.

1527
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,400
Hey, you may run into Michael.
He lives here.

1528
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,500
Oh, yeah, right. Michael.
Michael. He's so mature...

1529
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,900
because he lets you navigate
that entire relationship.

1530
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,100
Well, I'm sorry, Lelaina,
but you can't navigate me.

1531
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,200
I might do mean things,
and I might hurt you...

1532
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,100
and I might run away
without your permission...

1533
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,600
and you might hate me forever.

1534
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,800
And I know that that scares
the shit out of you...

1535
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,900
because I'm the only
real thing that you have.

1536
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,100
Yeah? Well, that ain't
real much.

1537
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,600
One, two, three, four.

1538
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,800
Hey, Troy, man, you're on.

1539
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,000
Michael, I'm sorry...

1540
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,900
Listen, I'm sorry, all right?
That's what this is all about.

1541
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,500
This one's for you, Lainie.

1542
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:22,100
Why can't I get just one kiss?

1543
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,300
You told me there'd be some
things that I wouldn't miss

1544
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,800
But I looked at your pants

1545
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,100
And I need a kiss

1546
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,100
Why can't I get just one screw?

1547
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,600
Believe me, I'd know
what to do

1548
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,500
But something won't let me
make love to you

1549
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,300
Why can't I get just one ah?

1550
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,700
Oh, nice job. Very well done.
Really good.

1551
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,200
I don't want to hear it
from you.

1552
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,200
Yeah? Well, I forgot I'm not
qualified to talk to you.

1553
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,100
I'm sorry I can't be Mister...

1554
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,800
Hey, look at me.
I'm Buddha on the mountaintop.

1555
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,200
You know what you are, man?
You what what you remind me of?

1556
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:12,200
You're like that guy,
you know, with the...

1557
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,700
with the hat and the bells
and the little, you know...

1558
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,100
The court jester.

1559
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,200
Yeah, right. Where everything's
so easy to laugh at...

1560
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,200
from a safe distance
back in Clever-Clever Land.

1561
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,900
You know what happens to him?

1562
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,200
They find his skull in a grave,
and they go...

1563
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,600
"Oh, I knew him,
and he was funny. "

1564
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,600
And the guy, the court jester,
dies all by himself.

1565
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,400
Where'd you hear that,
a Renaissance festival?

1566
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,400
Besides, everyone dies
all by himself.

1567
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,200
If you really believe that...

1568
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,500
Who are you looking for
out here?

1569
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:25,100
SINGING:
You say you want

1570
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,900
Diamonds on a ring of gold

1571
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:35,100
You say you want

1572
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:40,200
Your story to remain untold

1573
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:45,300
But all the promises we make

1574
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:50,600
From the cradle to the grave

1575
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:58,900
When all I want is you

1576
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,600
You say you'll give me

1577
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,500
A highway with no one on it

1578
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Treasure just to look upon it

1579
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:26,400
All the riches in the night

1580
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:32,600
You say you'll give me

1581
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:37,500
Eyes in a moon of blindness

1582
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:42,000
A river in a time of dryness

1583
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,400
A harbour in the tempest

1584
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:52,300
But all the promises we make

1585
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:57,900
From the cradle to the grave

1586
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:04,800
When all I want is you

1587
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,700
Hello.

1588
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,800
Hello?

1589
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:43,300
SINGING:
All I want is you

1590
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:48,600
All I want is you

1591
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:53,800
All I want is you...

1592
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
-Hey, Lainie. This is Lance.
-Hi.

1593
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Um... I just need to know
if he's OK.

1594
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,500
Huh?

1595
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
OK. All I know is
he went back to Chicago...

1596
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,500
alone.

1597
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I'm not supposed
to know that, am I?

1598
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,000
Shit.

1599
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,000
Shit.

1600
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,900
Hi.

1601
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:39,000
I was wondering if I could talk
to you for a minute...

1602
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,500
before you go.

1603
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:50,100
See, the thing is that, um...

1604
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,600
Well...

1605
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,600
my dad died.

1606
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,600
Oh, god, Troy. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1607
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,300
No. It...

1608
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,100
What happened was that, um...

1609
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:12,200
I kind of got this arcane
glimpse at the universe.

1610
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,600
And the best thing
that I can say about that is...

1611
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,200
I don't know. I...

1612
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:34,200
I have this...
this planet of regret...

1613
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,200
sitting on my shoulders.

1614
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:43,200
And you have no idea how much
I wish that I could go back...

1615
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,000
to that morning
after we made love...

1616
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,800
and do everything different.

1617
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,400
But I know that I can't, so...

1618
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:58,200
I thought that I would come here
and tell you something.

1619
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,700
And what I wanted to tell you...

1620
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,700
was that I love you...

1621
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:08,700
and, uh... just wanted to
make sure that that was clear...

1622
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,300
so that there wasn't
any confusion.

1623
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:18,700
Um...

1624
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:22,700
So, anyway, uh...

1625
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,900
Where are you going?

1626
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:29,300
I was going to look for you.

1627
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,300
What for?

1628
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:40,900
Just... wanted to see
if you were OK.

1629
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,700
Well, I had
a shitty week, you know.

1630
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,100
A froggy went
a-courting, and he did ride

1631
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:36,400
With a sword and a pistol
by his side

1632
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:41,400
Uh-huh, uh-huh, mmm-hmm-hmm

1633
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,900
Well, he rode right up
to Miss Mousie's door...

1634
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,400
TROY ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
At the beep...

1635
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,400
please leave your name, number,
and a brief justification...

1636
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,900
for the ontological necessity...

1637
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,900
of modern man's
existential dilemma...

1638
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,400
and we'll get back to you.

1639
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,300
Uh, Lelaina,
this is your dad.

1640
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,200
Give me a call
when you get this.

1641
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,000
I need you to explain something.

1642
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,900
I just got a nine-hundred-dollar
bill on my gas card.

1643
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:15,900
If we should fall,
love will catch us every time

1644
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,500
I hear you call,
I will run

1645
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:26,600
And if the magic
of the adventure overcomes

1646
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:30,600
We won't cry,
because it could be fun

1647
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,600
What I'm trying to do is
constantly find those people...

1648
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,600
find out what makes them
the best and bring that...

1649
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,100
Tired of getting razzes
for being bald?

1650
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,600
I'm only a young man.

1651
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,600
No more dates
where I've been called old man.

1652
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,300
Roy, why are you
doing this to me?

1653
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:49,800
I know we can be happy together.

1654
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,700
You'll chill in time.
Right now, I need someone...

1655
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,500
who understands what my music
and the band mean to me.

1656
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,800
But it's just music, Roy.

1657
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:00,600
I'm a human being
with deep feelings...

1658
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,800
who feels things deeply.

1659
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,100
Music is feeling, babe.

1660
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,600
The band may be a small dream,
but it's the only one I've got.

1661
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,600
I'm Audi 5000.

1662
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:16,100
Please don't let him
get drunk and drive.

1663
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:19,000
SINGING:
Won't be very long

1664
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,800
Till I'm going, going, gone

1665
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:37,100
You say

1666
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,100
I only hear what I want to

1667
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,100
You say

1668
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,200
I talk so all the time

1669
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,600
So?

1670
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,500
And I thought
what I felt was simple

1671
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,400
And I thought
that I don't belong

1672
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,400
And now that I am leaving

1673
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,800
Now I know
that I did something wrong

1674
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,400
'Cause I missed you

1675
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,600
Yeah, yeah, I missed you

1676
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,900
And you say

1677
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,300
I only hear what I want to

1678
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,800
I don't listen hard,
I don't pay attention

1679
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,500
To the distance
that you're running

1680
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,100
Or to anyone, anywhere

1681
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,000
I don't understand
if you really care

1682
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,800
I'm only hearing negative,
no, no, no, no

1683
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,800
No...

1684
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,300
So I turned the radio on,
I turned the radio up

1685
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,800
And this woman
was singing my song

1686
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,100
The lover's in love,
and the other's run away

1687
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,800
The lover is crying
'cause the other won't stay

1688
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,500
Some of us hover
when we weep for the other

1689
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,500
Who was dying since
the day they were born, well

1690
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,500
Well, this is not that,
I think that I'm throwing

1691
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,800
But I'm thrown

1692
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,300
And I thought I'd live forever,
but now I'm not so sure

1693
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,300
You try to tell me
that I'm clever

1694
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:13,500
But that won't take me anyhow

1695
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:17,300
Or anywhere with you

1696
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,300
You said that I was naive and

1697
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,300
I thought
that I was strong, no

1698
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,400
I thought, hey, I can leave,
I can leave, though

1699
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,400
But now I know
that I was wrong

1700
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,300
Because I missed you

1701
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,000
Yeah, I missed you
