2
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,930
Eileen.

3
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,420
Eileen!

4
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,290
I need form I-37.

5
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,690
- Transfer form?
- No.

6
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,950
Intake. I-37.

7
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,950
Aren't you listening?

8
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,430
She is useless.

9
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,610
Dr. Frye
still needs to sign it.

10
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,740
He's probably asleep
in his office.

11
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,570
Oh, yeah.

12
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,400
Maybe you could go
wake up Dr. Frye.

13
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,090
Blow softly in his ear.

14
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,790
- He loves that.

15
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,230
Leave Eileen alone.

16
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,880
She's tired.

17
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,970
Oh, is that what it is?

18
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,100
I thought maybe it was
that time of the month.

19
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,020
At least I have
a time of the month.

20
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,760
Oh, yeah.
You know something, honey?

21
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,670
It won't last forever.
You'll be old like us soon.

22
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,500
: Mrs. Nelson
to the visiting area, please.

23
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,890
Mrs. Nelson
to the visiting area.

24
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,180
I'm not gonna fight
with anybody. I told you.

25
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,360
How's Mickey doing?

26
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,750
I'm trying to be good.

27
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,060
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

28
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,320
Well, it's not my fault...

29
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,420
Maybe I'll see you next time.

30
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,820
As much as we're
gonna miss the old dog,

31
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,520
I hope you'll all be welcoming

32
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
to Dr. Frye's replacement
on Monday.

33
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,390
A fine, fine young doctor.

34
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,400
Yes, well, let's hope
the boys take her seriously.

35
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,660
I'll take her.

36
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,830
- Seriously.

37
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,270
I think you will be
taking your insulin

38
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,880
and your retirement package.

39
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,270
That'll be enough for you.

40
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,710
That's right.

41
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,580
I'll really miss
all the fun around here.

42
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,320
Let's hear it for Dr. Frye.

43
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,330
Cheers!

44
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,830
I see a lot of Anne these days.

45
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,920
Yeah, a lot
of broken hearts out there.

46
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,750
Hey, hon.

47
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,230
Hey.

48
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,480
How's your dad?

49
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,580
Good.

50
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,750
You know what? Let me get that.

51
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,800
Thanks.

52
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,470
...want you to go inside
and shut the fuck up!

53
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,220
You shut... you shut up!

54
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,780
Fuck off! Shut up!
You shut up!

55
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,480
Fucking booze bag!
Oh, I'll do...

56
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,440
- I'm gonna have a drink.
- You all right there, chief?

57
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,050
You can fuck right off.

58
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,140
Goddamn Lutherans next door
are the problem, not me.

59
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,230
Nobody's complaining.
We just want to make sure

60
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,620
you're getting home
safe and sound.

61
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,710
Nobody's complaining?

62
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,750
- Dad.
- Safe and sound?

63
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,930
Why wouldn't I be safe
and sound?

64
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,360
Dad.

65
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,800
I keep the whole fucking
neighborhood safe and sound.

66
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,580
- What do you know?
- Dad.

67
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,020
E-Eileen, go inside.

68
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,020
- Okay. Dad, look to me.
- Go inside.

69
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,330
Come on. Please. Please.

70
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,110
Hey! You're causing a scene.

71
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,770
Trust me, Eileen.
Nobody wants nothing with you.

72
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,200
- Okay.
- Mwah!

73
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,810
- Come on. Go inside.
- Mwah!

74
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,550
Goddamn Lutherans right there.

75
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,560
Your mother always hated
those people.

76
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,470
- Gosh, let's go inside.
- They can fuck off. Sure.

77
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,210
You can't go around
policing people, Dad.

78
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,820
Who says?
You know who that guy was?

79
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,300
We got it all
under control, chief.

80
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,780
You can take it easy. Please.

81
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,000
Take it easy?
Y-You fuckin' take it easy.

82
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,310
You're not a cop anymore.

83
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,610
Yeah, sure.

84
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,220
I didn't want to retire.
They made me,

85
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,530
'cause I was
too goddamn good at it.

86
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,920
Look, I gotta get
back to the station.

87
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,010
Pour me a drink. Good.

88
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,190
Get back to the station, Buck.

89
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,670
Give me my drink.

90
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,540
Just give us a call
if you need anything.

91
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,140
Merry Christmas.

92
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,370
Hey, come here.
What's that smell?

93
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,550
Did you step in something?

94
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,900
No. Why? What do you smell?

95
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,150
I don't know. Roadkill.

96
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,590
Maybe you should
keep your distance.

97
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,170
Yeah, I'll keep my distance.

98
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,340
The fuck you doing?
Put my fucking shoes back on.

99
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,390
But maybe
you should be nicer to me.

100
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,430
No one else is gonna
put up with your shit.

101
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,260
Go then, 'cause I got Joanie.

102
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,180
She wouldn't keep a place
looking like this.

103
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,180
She's a real woman,
your sister.

104
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,100
And she smells like a woman.

105
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,790
She knows how to keep a house!

106
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,230
And she doesn't live here,
and she's married!

107
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,840
Yeah, 'cause she's
not a hanger-on.

108
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,760
And she doesn't want
to talk to you!

109
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,070
Yeah, sure, 'cause she's
made a life of her own.

110
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,930
She's made something
of herself.

111
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,330
Whatever, Dad.

112
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,670
Get a life, Eileen. Get a clue.

113
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,510
Shit.

114
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,610
Fuck it.

115
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,440
All right, listen up!

116
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,360
As you know, in the new year,

117
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,740
we will be up for state review.

118
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,410
So we're gonna be
tightening our procedures

119
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,580
and implementing new strategies
based on some big, new ideas.

120
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,890
And on that note,
this new young lady to my left,

121
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,510
Dr. Miss Rebecca St. John,

122
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,420
is our new prison psychologist.

123
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,990
She's just finished
her doctorate at Radcliffe.

124
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,470
Harvard.

125
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,470
Ah. Harvard.

126
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,950
We may not be Harvard people,

127
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,130
but I think
we can keep up with her,

128
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,440
and hopefully she can
keep up with us

129
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,870
as we keep up with them.

130
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,790
She may be easy on the eyes,
but I assure you,

131
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,660
she is very smart.

132
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,530
: Ladies, I hope you
show Miss St. John around...

133
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,370
Say, how much for a glazed?

134
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,810
They're free.

135
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm kidding.

136
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,170
I'm Rebecca.

137
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,860
I know.

138
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,480
Say, where can a girl
get freshened up around here?

139
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,000
I can show you.

140
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,130
Sure. Appreciate it.

141
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,480
Can I take your jacket?

142
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,520
Aren't you sweet? Thanks.

143
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,870
This way.

144
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,790
I don't think
I caught your name.

145
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,010
Eileen.

146
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,100
- Morning.
- Morning.

147
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,410
Where you from?

148
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,670
Huh?

149
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,240
Oh, I'm from New York
originally.

150
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
- Manhattan.

151
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,680
Couldn't stand Cambridge.
Way too uptight.

152
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,370
Well, there were a couple
of interesting people,

153
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,120
but, no, I needed a break.

154
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,680
Get some fresh air.

155
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,540
And I love the beach.

156
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,460
All right.

157
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,560
32...

158
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,120
24...

159
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,350
...34.

160
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,830
Practically my measurements.

161
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,400
You know, some women
think their figures

162
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,490
are the only thing
that matters.

163
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,700
Honestly, I think
that's kind of pathetic.

164
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,100
I completely agree.

165
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,320
My sister's like that,
and she's not very smart.

166
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,890
Mm, good. Then you and I

167
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,840
have better things to discuss
than our figures.

168
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,720
Although that isn't
the popular opinion,

169
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,020
wouldn't you say?

170
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,750
I don't care what's popular.

171
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,850
Well, look at you.

172
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,460
A regular Katharine Hepburn.

173
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,640
Rare to meet a young woman
with so much gumption.

174
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm like that, too.

175
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,040
I don't give a rat's ass
what people think.

176
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,300
They're probably scared of you.

177
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,120
Moi?

178
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,290
All right. See you around.

179
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,480
- Every year,

180
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,310
we hold this special assembly

181
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,790
to celebrate the birth
of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

182
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,010
And every year,
one of you sick bastards

183
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,660
ruins it for the rest of us.

184
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,580
Well, you've disrespected
Christmas for the last time

185
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,710
because this year,
you're gonna sit on your hands,

186
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,720
you're gonna zip your lips.

187
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,110
If I see any of you biting,
kicking, screaming, pushing,

188
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,500
pulling hair,
laughing, moaning,

189
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,460
or I hear one wayward comment,

190
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,640
you're going
straight to the cave.

191
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,900
And now, without further ado,

192
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,560
it is my honor to thank
the people from Mount Olive

193
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,340
who helped me direct
the pageant again this year...

194
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,170
Yay, Mount Olive.
- and present to you

195
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,960
"Christmas in Prison."

196
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,930
I'm gonna kill someone
on Christmas.

197
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,660
Shut up!

198
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh, what am I to do?

199
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,810
Sentenced for three years
to sit indoors

200
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,990
among boys of my same creed,
plain bad.

201
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,990
- So much time to plot

202
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,470
what evildoings I'll undertake
as soon as I get out.

203
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,210
You want some cake, you fatty?!

204
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,210
In the meantime,
I suppose I could read a book.

205
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,210
You can't read, motherfucker!

206
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,520
Fucking Shakespeare up here.

207
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,190
I'm scrappy right now.

208
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,270
Book of truth!

209
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,890
Oh, look at McAllister.

210
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,110
- Fucking McAllister.

211
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,850
Hey, nice rack!

212
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,510
Well, I'm-I'm pretty tired.

213
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,510
Can we rest in that barn
over there?

214
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,990
Better than paying for a motel.

215
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,820
You're the best, Joseph.

216
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,950
Thank you for taking us here
to be counted in the census.

217
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,080
Fuck this shit!

218
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,390
Guard!
Wait.

219
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,860
- Wait. Wait, wait.
Hey, grab him.

220
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,480
Move back!

221
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,810
All you guys sit down!

222
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,500
Sit the fuck down!

223
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,680
Hey, Bob.

224
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,730
Hey, hon.

225
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,160
This and a pack of Luckies.

226
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,170
Oh! It's a lucky day, huh?

227
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,820
Yeah, the luckiest.

228
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,340
Yup. Cigarettes are great.

229
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,510
Don't light yourself on fire.

230
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,400
You're in a good mood,
what's wrong with you?

231
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,410
Nothing's wrong, Dad.

232
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,450
You look funny with that thing
in your mouth.

233
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,290
How was your day, Dad?

234
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,890
How was my day?

235
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,030
I don't know.

236
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,860
It was a day, just another day.

237
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,500
What's the point?

238
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,300
My day was a doozy.

239
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,520
Oh, yeah?

240
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,650
A big fight broke out
at the Christmas pageant.

241
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,440
Kid got his collarbone broken,

242
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,440
and I had to do all
this paperwork for the warden.

243
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,910
Don't ash on the floor,
it's tacky.

244
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,660
Anyway...

245
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,710
It was one of those days
you never forget.

246
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,830
Oh, yeah?
Days I'll never forget.

247
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,850
Let me see.

248
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,110
December 16, 1944,

249
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,550
first time I ever held
a dead man's head in my lap.

250
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,940
What a waste.

251
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,410
20 degrees outside and snowing.

252
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,690
Just like it is here.

253
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,250
Don't know why I ever
came back to this place.

254
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,520
Maybe because you had a wife
and two kids.

255
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,250
Maybe.

256
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,130
I love the beach.

257
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,350
Oh, yeah? Good for you.

258
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,480
War kind of ruined beaches
for me.

259
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,830
So what else?

260
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,490
How's that Polk kid?
He talked yet?

261
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,530
Huh?

262
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,880
Polk.

263
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,740
The kid who stabbed
his father...

264
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,750
...who was a good cop,
more or less.

265
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,880
What kind of kid thinks of
killing his father like that?

266
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,160
Stab him in his sleep...

267
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,980
in front of his mother.

268
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,770
Then he just sits down.

269
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,820
Never denies it.

270
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,070
Never says a word
the whole trial.

271
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,030
Psychopathic.

272
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,090
Course I wouldn't
have to worry about you

273
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,000
doing something like that,
now, would I?

274
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,140
'Cause you're a girl.

275
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,220
Can't imagine you with a knife.

276
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,480
Can you imagine me with a gun?

277
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,050
Yeah, I can see it.

278
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,590
One day...

279
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,980
when you've had enough
and you feel like, uh...

280
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,760
ducking out.

281
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Maybe when I'm dead and gone

282
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,370
and you got nobody
and you never will.

283
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,240
I could imagine that.

284
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,720
But you wouldn't, would you?

285
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,350
'Cause you're too good.

286
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,220
Say, give me
one of those cigarettes.

287
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,270
What have you got, Old Gold?

288
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,700
No.

289
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,260
I like Old Gold.

290
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,090
I know.

291
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,290
Oopsie.

292
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,640
Do you need any help?

293
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,690
Uh, no, I'm okay.

294
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,170
Just butterfingers.

295
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,260
You should see me.

296
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,900
I'm a total klutz.

297
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,960
Oh, right.

298
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,310
Lee Polk.

299
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,830
That's not something
you see every day.

300
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,010
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

301
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,100
Bedtime reading?

302
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,970
I was just doing some filing.

303
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,840
That's some show yesterday.

304
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,420
They do it every year.

305
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,200
I'd call that
cruel and unusual punishment.

306
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,000
Sorry. I don't usually smoke.

307
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,610
It's a nasty habit.

308
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,220
That's why I like it.

309
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,740
Not very becoming
of a lady, though.

310
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,880
Turns your teeth yellow.

311
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,570
See?

312
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,660
That's cigarettes and coffee.

313
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,190
And red wine.

314
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,140
No, your teeth are perfect.

315
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,190
I don't drink coffee,

316
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,530
so my teeth
should be fine, but...

317
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,940
...they're all rotted

318
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,290
due to my extreme propensity
for sweets.

319
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,770
A propensity for sweets.

320
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,800
You don't get enough sweetness
in your life?

321
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,080
I just eat a lot of candy.

322
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,080
Mm. I wouldn't know it
to look at you.

323
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,390
You're so petite.

324
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,390
Being tall has its advantages,
of course,

325
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,560
but most men
are just too short for me.

326
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,920
Have you noticed,
or am I imagining things,

327
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,440
that men these days are
getting shorter and shorter,

328
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,830
balder, and fatter?

329
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,180
All the men around here
are little boys.

330
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,620
You're funny.

331
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,710
I meant outside this prison.

332
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,760
Although you're right.

333
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,110
The guards, the warden,

334
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,670
they're not much to look at.

335
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,760
You should have seen Dr. Frye.

336
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,500
He was really
pretty nasty looking.

337
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,290
That doesn't surprise me.

338
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,460
My office isn't very becoming,

339
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,380
and it all smells
of dirty leather.

340
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,120
I'm beginning to wonder
what went on in there.

341
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,590
Nothing good.

342
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,210
I mean, I never actually
been in that office.

343
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh. Well, you should
come by sometime.

344
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,170
Although if the door's closed,

345
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,440
that means
I'm with one of the boys.

346
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay.

347
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,400
Aren't you ever scared

348
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,620
being alone in there with them?

349
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,350
No.

350
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,450
Come by, and see me sometime,
all right?

351
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,230
Although, you know, if you
hear me screaming in there,

352
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,060
feel free to kick down the door
and rescue me.

353
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,490
Okay.

354
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm just kidding, honey.

355
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,930
There's a buzzer.

356
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,550
I'm here to see Leonard Polk.

357
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,810
Anne Polk.

358
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,830
You're not on the schedule.

359
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,220
Are you a late addition?

360
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,270
I-I was called.

361
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,400
I don't know, I-I'm here now.

362
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,410
Well, you need
to fill out a form.

363
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,880
Aren't you Chief Dunlop's kid?

364
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,020
Yeah.

365
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,370
I thought so.

366
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,590
Mrs. Polk? I'm Dr. St. John.

367
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,900
We spoke on the phone.
Thank you so much for coming.

368
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,030
Oh, no need
to bother with that.

369
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,030
We all know who you are.

370
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,430
Eileen, would you
help us with the door?

371
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,780
Thank you.

372
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,860
- It's this way.

373
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,950
Take your coat?

374
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,340
Please.

375
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,650
Thank you, Eileen.

376
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,870
After you.

377
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,770
Why are you doing this to me?

378
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,390
Huh?

379
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,390
You got something to say to me?

380
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,840
Let me out!

381
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,110
Let me out! Let me out!

382
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,680
Let me out!

383
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,980
Y-You do... y'all do
what you want with him.

384
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,200
Won't even talk
to his own mother?

385
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,210
He's always been a nasty boy.

386
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,990
A filthy, nasty boy!

387
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,120
I need to lock up.

388
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,740
Visitation hours were
actually over 20 minutes ago.

389
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,250
Oh, I-I understand.

390
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,350
Would you like to keep talking
in my office?

391
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,230
- Let's go.
- Turn around.

392
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,580
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.

393
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,220
- I need to cuff him.
- No.

394
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,140
Don't worry, Lee.
It's all right.

395
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,980
:
That won't be necessary.

396
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,950
Don't do that. She's a doctor.

397
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,210
I think she needs a doctor.

398
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,250
That kid killed a cop.

399
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,210
He killed his father.

400
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,470
There's a difference.

401
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,210
Oh, I'm so
sorry. Let me see who it is.

402
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,220
Oh, Eileen.

403
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,520
Um, can I help you?

404
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,310
You forgot your notebook.

405
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,970
Oh, thank you so much.

406
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,270
I actually need this.

407
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,190
Um, hope you didn't read it.

408
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,710
- No, of course not.
- Oh, no,

409
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,700
I'm just kidding.
It's just chicken scratch.

410
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,930
Wait. Eileen.

411
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,770
I don't mean to be forward,

412
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,940
and, um, you probably
have other plans already,

413
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,210
but, um, can I take you
to a drink tonight?

414
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,950
I don't know anyone
in this darn town,

415
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,990
and I'd love to treat you
to a cocktail if you're game.

416
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,690
- Okay.
- Okay?

417
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,040
- I've twisted your arm?

418
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,430
So, uh, who makes
the best martini in town?

419
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,350
- Maybe O'Hara's?
- O'Hara's.

420
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,740
It's actually
the only bar in town.

421
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,000
No, O'Hara's is good.

422
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,490
See you at 7:00?

423
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,270
With bells on?
Is that the expression?

424
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,890
Ah!

425
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,960
- Hi.
- Oh, Eileen.

426
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,440
Hi.

427
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,650
Please, please, please, sit.

428
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,530
Um, what are you having?

429
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,960
Uh, I'll have a beer, I guess.

430
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,530
A beer? Oh.

431
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,840
Hi, Eileen.

432
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,920
Good to see you, hon.

433
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,060
What's next, sweetheart?

434
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,490
Um, well... Oh, my stars.

435
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,190
You're absolutely frozen.

436
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,500
Um, one beer, please,
and maybe a little whiskey

437
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,010
to warm up my girl.
What say, huh?

438
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,630
My, you look very glamorous.

439
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,850
It's just an old dress.

440
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,060
May I?

441
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,730
How about you,
sweetheart? Another martini?

442
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,170
Love one. Thank you.

443
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,740
Maybe let's hold the olives
this time.

444
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,700
I thought I'd have
a hard time finding this place,

445
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,430
but here it is.

446
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,520
You feeling all right?

447
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,710
Yeah, I'm fine.

448
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,360
Uh, there's something wrong
with my car,

449
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,320
so I have to drive
with the windows down,

450
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,150
or else it fills with smoke.

451
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,500
- Oh, you're kidding.

452
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,240
That sounds absolutely awful.

453
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,110
Can't you get your husband
to fix that for you?

454
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,240
Oh, no, I'm not married.

455
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
I've always been single.

456
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,770
And when I do
have a guy around,

457
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,810
it's just for fun,
and it's brief.

458
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,120
No, I never stay anywhere
long with anything.

459
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,340
Sort of my modus vivendi

460
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,380
or my pathology, depending on
who I'm talking to.

461
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,180
How long have you
worked at Moorehead?

462
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,000
Three or four years.

463
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,700
Uh, it was only
supposed to be temporary,

464
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,930
while I moved back for a bit
while my mother was sick,

465
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,320
and then she died, so...

466
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,240
I've been at the prison,
and time's just flown by.

467
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
Oh, God.

468
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,980
Prison is no place
for time to fly by.

469
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,410
And your mother dying.

470
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,990
That's a lot for a young lady.

471
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,600
Ah. 24.

472
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,770
Then you must be eager
to get back out there. Are you?

473
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,780
You know, um,
I'm an orphan, too.

474
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,570
My uncle raised me out West.

475
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,220
Where the sun shines.

476
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't understand
how you all do it here,

477
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,610
winter after winter.

478
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,100
It's positively creepy.
I don't know.

479
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,360
I'm in a sort of strange
love affair with New England.

480
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,660
I love it, but I also hate it.

481
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,530
Things feel very real here,
don't they?

482
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,710
Sort of there's no...

483
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,110
...imagination.

484
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,850
There's no sentimentality
or fantasy.

485
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,190
There's... there's just
nowhere to hide.

486
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,250
Sorry.

487
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,170
I've had too much to drink.

488
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,390
I tend to talk when I've had
too much to drink.

489
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,780
It's all right.

490
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,170
Mm, it's better
than talking too little.

491
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,860
Did you see Lee Polk today?

492
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,350
Uh...

493
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,920
Did she say anything to you?

494
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,870
Mrs. Polk?

495
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,060
She was just upset.

496
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,540
Those mothers are always upset.

497
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,840
Mm-hmm.

498
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,360
Did she seem
like an angry woman to you?

499
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,760
I don't know. Uh...

500
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,240
everyone's kind of angry here.

501
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,930
- It's Massachusetts.
- Mm.

502
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,250
Well, I had this professor
at Harvard.

503
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,250
He was brilliant,
but very difficult.

504
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,520
Uh, he did this--
these experiments on prisoners

505
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,740
studying the effects
of psychedelics on recidivism.

506
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,000
Now, I don't agree
with his methods,

507
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,260
there is no magic pill,

508
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,990
but... but you can
set people free...

509
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,440
...if you can get them to tell
the truth, to feel it.

510
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,220
That's what I want to do.

511
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,270
Secrets and lies.

512
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,570
I tell you, doll...

513
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,190
...some families are so sick,
so twisted,

514
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,890
the only way out's
for someone to die.

515
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,530
Don't you think?

516
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,840
Hey! What'd you say
your name was?

517
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,720
Who, me?

518
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,720
Ah, yeah. W-We was just saying

519
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,200
that you look so familiar.

520
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,030
Are you in the movies
or something?

521
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,690
Hardly. I work
at the boys' prison.

522
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,820
- Ah.
- I'm Eileen,

523
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,990
and this is my friend, Rebecca.

524
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,680
She's a psychologist.

525
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,870
Don't be shy, Rebecca.

526
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,040
These boys won't bite.

527
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,610
Not unless you ask us to.

528
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,350
This is Jerry.
You can ignore him.

529
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,400
He's married.

530
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,880
What happened
to your teeth, Jerry?

531
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,750
You get into a fight
with your old lady?

532
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,710
That's it. His wife's
got a left like Joe Frazier.

533
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,060
Nah, nah.
He... he slipped on the ice.

534
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,580
I'm gonna grow
some new ones, though.

535
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,150
Mm-hmm.

536
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,710
Just need a few more of these.

537
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,800
Cheers to that.
To Jerry and his new teeth.

538
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,330
Hey.

539
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,940
Feel like dancing, Rebecca?

540
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,550
With you?

541
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,200
Yeah.

542
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,920
You remind me of a girl
in a Dutch painting.

543
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,200
You have a strange face.

544
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,370
It's plain, but...

545
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,850
...fascinating.

546
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,980
It has a beautiful...

547
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,160
...turbulence.

548
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,980
I love it.

549
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,690
I bet you have
brilliant dreams.

550
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,960
I bet you dream
of other worlds.

551
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,090
Maybe you'll dream of me
and my morning remorse,

552
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,310
which is certain.

553
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,580
I shouldn't drink,

554
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,880
- but I do.

555
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,180
Thank you.

556
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,930
Hey, Sandy, can I get a martini
and some matches?

557
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,290
Better be careful, Eileen.

558
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,020
I don't want any trouble
with your dad.

559
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,370
My dad's not gonna cause
any trouble.

560
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,510
Dad. Dad.

561
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,420
Dad, can you let me in?

562
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,070
Shit.

563
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,500
Hey, Dad!

564
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,850
Can I have the keys?

565
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,940
Can I please have the keys?

566
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,550
- No, you may not have the keys.

567
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,420
Not until you read that book
from cover to cover.

568
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,590
I want to hear every word.

569
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,590
Where'd you put the keys?

570
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,820
Make yourself comfortable,
Eileen.

571
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,700
You're not going anywhere
till you read the last word.

572
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,080
Dad, this is ridiculous.
I need to go to work.

573
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,220
Out all night.

574
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,660
Nearly crashed the car.

575
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,920
Sleeping in your own sick,

576
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,060
and now you're worried
about getting to work on time?

577
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,090
I can hardly look at you,
I'm so ashamed.

578
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,710
Oliver Twist would be grateful
for this home,

579
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,590
but you, Eileen,

580
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,110
you're trash, Eileen,
just trash.

581
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,590
All I did was go out
with a girl from work.

582
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,940
You went out
with a girl from work?

583
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,370
Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

584
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,070
Who is he? Huh?

585
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,250
Who is this boy?
I just want to know who he is

586
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,210
before you get knocked up
and sell your soul to Satan.

587
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,640
Can you just give me the keys?!

588
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,340
Please! I'll be late!

589
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,430
You're not going anywhere
dressed like that.

590
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,780
I mean, really, Eileen,
how dare you?

591
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,610
That's the dress your mother
wore to my father's funeral.

592
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,790
You got no respect for anyone.

593
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,270
Get changed.

594
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,700
I don't want anyone
seeing you in that getup.

595
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,260
They'll think I'm dead.

596
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,310
Ah. Miss Dunlop?

597
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,710
May I, um, may I have a word?

598
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,060
Oh, Jesus.

599
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,590
It's about your father.

600
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,760
Him? Go talk to him.
He's inside.

601
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,110
It's about his gun.

602
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,380
This oughta be good.

603
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,550
Pray tell, Buck.

604
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,940
Uh, yesterday,

605
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,950
we got several complaints
from neighbors,

606
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,640
from Miss Connie
down at the school,

607
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,820
that, uh, Chief Dunlop

608
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,480
was sitting
in that north-facing window

609
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,040
and, uh, pointing his weapon

610
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,520
at children walking home
from school.

611
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,830
He has agreed to relinquish
the property into your care.

612
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,180
As long as you promise
not to use it on him.

613
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,700
His words.

614
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,660
May I come in?

615
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,970
Want to hang it on me
like an ornament?

616
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,230
Aw.

617
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:13,110
I'm sure that Miss Dunlop

618
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,240
will take excellent care
of the weapon, sir.

619
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,670
As she does with all things,
Buck, as you can see.

620
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,320
Let me know which ones.

621
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,890
Sure. I'll hold.

622
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,630
Ah, look what
the cat dragged in.

623
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,980
- Good afternoon, Eileen.

624
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,160
You look fresh as a daisy,
as always.

625
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,420
I had car trouble.

626
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,850
Yeah, I believe
the trouble part.

627
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,200
It's almost Christmas.
Can you give me a break?

628
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,160
No. Get to work.

629
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,510
Okay. I need the Polk file.

630
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,040
- Yeah.

631
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,080
I think Dr. St. John has it.

632
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,560
Perfect.
Yeah, I'm afraid that one

633
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,610
will have to wait
till after the holidays.

634
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,260
We have a new doctor on staff,

635
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,740
and, uh, apparently she
doesn't follow procedures.

636
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,740
- She's not in today?
- Been and gone.

637
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,010
She's gonna be back
after Christmas.

638
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,090
Yeah. Will do.

639
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,710
All right, then. Thank you.

640
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,010
Bye-bye.

641
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,240
Where do you think
you're going?

642
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,720
The infirmary.

643
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,330
I think something's
going around.

644
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,100
You look like
you've been going around.

645
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,550
She's a boozer.

646
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,970
Dad?

647
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,510
Dad?

648
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,660
Dad?

649
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,920
- Dad, can you hear me?

650
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,490
Dad, can you hear me?

651
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,270
- What were you doing up there?
- I need my gun.

652
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,360
- Sit up.
- It's after me.

653
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,360
Nobody's after you.

654
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,100
Sit up. Sit up.

655
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,810
Joanie.

656
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,670
That you, Joanie?

657
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,860
Hey.

658
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,470
Joanie. Joanie.

659
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,080
Joanie.

660
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,780
Dad.

661
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,000
Quit your fussing, Joanie.

662
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,400
We stitched him up,

663
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,010
and I don't think
he has a concussion,

664
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,490
but his blood alcohol level

665
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,150
is point one-seven.

666
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,240
His liver's enlarged,
and he's covered in bruises.

667
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,670
I'm not blaming you, honey,
but, uh...

668
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,060
Yeah, sure.

669
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,800
Hey, who's letting him
live like this?

670
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,110
I don't know. My mom died,
and he doesn't have a job.

671
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,770
What else is he supposed to do?

672
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,420
Yeah, there are men
who don't drink all day.

673
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,250
I know that.

674
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,990
Look, I know this
is hard for you, but, uh...

675
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,300
if he stops drinking,
he might die,

676
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,040
but if he keeps drinking,
it'll definitely kill him.

677
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,120
I don't know what else
to say to you.

678
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,300
Sit down, Dad.

679
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,450
The doctor told me
you're gonna die.

680
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,230
Oh, like he's not?

681
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,240
He said, if you
keep drinking like this,

682
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,500
it'll kill you.

683
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,160
Screw him.

684
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,590
You know they killed
your mother at that hospital.

685
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,450
They owe me more than stitches.

686
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,940
Can you lean back?

687
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,290
Course I can lean back.

688
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,300
You don't think
I know how to go to bed?

689
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,560
Well, I need a drink.

690
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,860
Dad!

691
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,520
And anyway,
I do not sleep here.

692
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,350
- It's haunted.
- Please, Dad.

693
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,570
If I get you a bottle,
will you lie down?

694
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,820
No. I want to have
a drink with my daughter.

695
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,660
You're different these days.

696
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,610
You're almost interesting.

697
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,670
What are you doing with all
the money you make at work?

698
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,230
Why don't you ever buy
your own clothes?

699
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,430
I remember that coat.

700
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,720
I remember your mother...

701
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,080
How does it look on me?

702
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,130
Well, your mother
looked beautiful in that coat.

703
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,050
I bought it for her to wear

704
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,470
when she got out
of the bughouse.

705
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,830
I always loved your mother.

706
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,790
No matter what you
thought it looked like,

707
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,220
I always loved her.

708
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,320
And I know
what people say about me.

709
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,840
They say I made her crazy
'cause I'm a hard-ass.

710
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,030
And I may have yelled
a few times,

711
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,800
but she always forgave me.

712
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,640
Because we loved each other.

713
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,070
Love will make you crazy,
Eileen.

714
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,520
You'll probably
never understand that.

715
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,030
Why?

716
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,830
Some people...

717
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,690
they're the real people.

718
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,360
Like in a movie, they're
the ones you're watching.

719
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,480
They're the ones making moves.

720
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,960
And the other people...

721
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,980
...they're just there
filling the space,

722
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,330
and you take 'em for granted.

723
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,290
You think, "They're easy."

724
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,190
Take a penny, leave a penny.

725
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,720
That's you, Eileen.

726
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,330
You're one of them.

727
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,330
What are you doing?
You don't gotta lock it.

728
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,070
- Let's go.

729
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,420
- Come on. Come on.

730
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,200
Come on. It's cold out here.

731
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,200
Come on. Hurry up.

732
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,410
Open the door.

733
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,500
Fucking heavy.

734
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,300
Give me my fucking drink.

735
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,320
Eileen!

736
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,070
Eileen!

737
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,520
What, Dad?

738
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,130
Phone rang.

739
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,810
Some woman looking for you.

740
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,910
What'd you say?

741
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,040
Nothing.

742
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,220
I know nothing. I said nothing.

743
00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,360
Hello.

744
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,400
Hello, Christmas angel.

745
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,150
Rebecca?

746
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,580
Look, I was just thinking
of you,

747
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,020
and, well, I-I don't know

748
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,460
what you're planning
for Christmas Eve,

749
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,460
but I thought maybe
you'd like to come over.

750
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,900
There are some records
we could play,

751
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,240
and maybe dance again
if all goes well.

752
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,730
Unless you have
a better offer, of course.

753
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,080
I don't have a better offer.

754
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,820
- So you'll come?
- Yeah.

755
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,730
Let me give you the address.

756
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,640
Okay. Hold on.

757
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,570
It's 32 Maple Street.

758
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,530
So see you later.

759
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,170
- Bye.
- Bye.

760
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,130
- Oh!

761
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:04,350
Y-You're here.

762
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,660
- It's a Christmas miracle.

763
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,100
Sorry it took me so long.

764
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,360
I think that cat's possessed.

765
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,450
Merry Christmas.

766
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,930
Oh. Aren't you a peach?

767
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,450
Come in! Come in.

768
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,240
Eileen, um,

769
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,940
I'm sorry the place
is such a mess.

770
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,370
I-I haven't... I mean,
I tried to clean it up a bit,

771
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,770
- but it's just beyond me.

772
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,030
I hope it doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

773
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:29,720
Let's open this wine.

774
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,470
Uh, sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

775
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,910
I hope you didn't have
to drive far. Was it far?

776
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,910
Uh, no.
I drive all over the place.

777
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,470
Let me take your coat.

778
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,350
- Thanks.
- Oh, my.

779
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,790
It's so nice and soft.

780
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,440
It's my mother's.

781
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,490
Well, uh, she must have
been a real classy lady

782
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,750
to have such a classy daughter.

783
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,530
She was something
of a clotheshorse, actually.

784
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,190
- I hope it's a kind you like.

785
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:01,800
Oh. I'm sure it's delicious.

786
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,670
Drink sounds nice, actually.

787
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,460
Let's see where
the corkscrew's hiding.

788
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,370
- Uh, you know,

789
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:10,250
I have just been so busy lately

790
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,640
that I can't seem
to remember where the...

791
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,470
But it's got to be here
under all this mess, right?

792
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,300
You know what?

793
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,260
A very handy young PhD student
once taught me a trick

794
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,610
for how to open a bottle
if you're ever stranded

795
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,380
without a corkscrew.

796
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,300
Philosophers are always
the biggest drunks.

797
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,570
Although he was kind of cute.

798
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,540
Eugene Henderson, Harvard.

799
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,630
I had no idea
you could do that.

800
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,980
That was a great trick.

801
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,890
Mm-hmm.

802
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,460
Now we need some glasses.

803
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,030
Ah.

804
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,640
So to Eileen,
my Christmas savior.

805
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,120
Savior?

806
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,430
I didn't do anything.

807
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,990
Well, you're being a friend.

808
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,000
That's everything. Cheers.

809
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,790
God, that's awful.

810
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,260
No. That's a...

811
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,220
...punch of flavor.

812
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,750
That's what a Syrah is.

813
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,830
Hope you haven't spent
too much on it.

814
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,620
To...

815
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,980
To Jesus Christ.

816
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,450
Happy birthday.

817
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,590
Mmm.

818
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,940
Do you live here alone?

819
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,070
No.

820
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,510
Oh, uh, sure.

821
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,600
I, uh...
No, I can't have roommates.

822
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,730
I, um,
I like my own space.

823
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,120
I still like to have fun,

824
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,390
and, uh, I can make
a lot of noise.

825
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:50,830
And, uh, I can
make a mess, as you can see,

826
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,480
but, uh, I can play music
as loud as I want to.

827
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,790
I can...

828
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,560
I can scream
as loud as I want to.

829
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,840
I can't stand roommates,
either.

830
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,750
In college,
I had to lock my door...

831
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,710
Oh, that's right.
You were in college.

832
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:09,710
What'd you study?

833
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,410
Just the required courses.

834
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,150
Um, if I hadn't left,

835
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,720
I probably would have
ended up a secretary anyway.

836
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,420
Eileen, you're not
really a secretary.

837
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,110
Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Stevens,
they're secretaries,

838
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:20,640
'cause they do
what they're told,

839
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,380
and that's why they're
miserable and nasty.

840
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,330
But you, you got a big life
ahead of you, I'm sure.

841
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:29,600
Okay. I'm not a real secretary.

842
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,430
No, you're not.

843
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,290
- 'Cause you're smart.
- Mm.

844
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,570
And you're curious, aren't you?

845
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,180
Mm, I never really did
very good in school,

846
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,090
so I'm just kind of average,
I think.

847
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,830
Oh, don't say that, Eileen.

848
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,660
- Never say that. Do you...?

849
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,620
You really think
you're a normal person?

850
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,100
Normal how?

851
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,810
I really am a bad hostess.

852
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,200
Maybe we'll, uh...

853
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,680
We'll feel better
if we eat something.

854
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,630
I feel fine.

855
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,510
Can I use your bathroom?

856
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,300
Sure.

857
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,610
Just up the stairs.

858
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,980
It's the other door,
on the right.

859
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,780
Sorry.

860
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,950
What do you have
to be sorry for?

861
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:28,960
Go on. Go on. Eat. Eat. Yeah.

862
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,440
Have a pickle, too.

863
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,350
Why do we need
a little, uh, cheese knife?

864
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,880
To keep our hands clean?

865
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,780
No. It's all ridiculous.

866
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,400
Everything is.

867
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,750
All these stupid traditions,

868
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:46,320
like the-the warden
and his prison at Christmas.

869
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,840
What do you mean?

870
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,370
I've tried explaining
how things need to change,

871
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,720
but all he cares about

872
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,500
is whether or not the boys
are gonna think about me

873
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,770
while they molest themselves
in their cells at night.

874
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,550
God forbid.

875
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,900
There's a strict

876
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,860
no masturbation policy
at Moorehead.

877
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,600
It's illegal
to get off in prison.

878
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,860
You know that, right?

879
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,870
As if that's
the downfall of civilization,

880
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,810
people having orgasms.

881
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,000
You can't count on men
to fix anything.

882
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,400
People are so ashamed
of their desires,

883
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,080
especially men.

884
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,960
Eileen...

885
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,110
...as you can
probably tell by now,

886
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,890
I live a little differently
than most people.

887
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:35,890
No, your house i-is nice.

888
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,070
- No.
- It's cozy.

889
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:40,510
I don't mean the house.
I mean...

890
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,240
I have my own ideas.

891
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,590
Maybe you and I
share some of those ideas.

892
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:51,940
What kind of ideas do we share?

893
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,430
May I confide in you?

894
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,040
Of course.

895
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,570
It's about Lee Polk.

896
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,930
- It is?
- Yes.

897
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:11,530
Tell me, honey...

898
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,060
...what would make a person
want to kill their father?

899
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,320
Everybody wants
to kill their father.

900
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,810
No, they don't.
Who told you that?

901
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:24,550
Really, think about it, Eileen.

902
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,810
Because Lee snuck
into his parents' bedroom

903
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,890
in the middle of the night...

904
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,860
...hacked through
his father's throat

905
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,430
with an old kitchen knife,

906
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:37,260
and stabbed him
in the chest repeatedly.

907
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:41,220
His mother claimed she thought
there'd been a break-in.

908
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,870
How do you sleep
through something like that?

909
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,400
I don't know.

910
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,660
You don't.
That's why I called her in.

911
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,180
I mean, you were there.

912
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,750
The poor boy
could barely look at her, so...

913
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,400
so afterwards,
I just asked him point-blank.

914
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,790
I said...

915
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,440
I said,
"What'd your father do to you?"

916
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:03,620
"What made you want to do that
to your father's body?"

917
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,460
And he spilled it all
in a matter of minutes.

918
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:11,150
Nobody had ever bothered
to ask him before.

919
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,600
No one had thought to ask.

920
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,600
Wouldn't you want to know?

921
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,650
Wouldn't you be curious?

922
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,170
Yes.

923
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:27,080
Do you want to know?

924
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,050
Yes.

925
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,710
Eileen, you can never
tell anyone. Do you understand?

926
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,970
You understa... Promise me.

927
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,220
Promise.

928
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,590
The first thing
you need to know,

929
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,020
this isn't my house.

930
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,280
This is the Polk house.

931
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,540
I have Mrs. Polk
tied up downstairs.

932
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:03,380
:
Eileen. Eileen.

933
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,390
Eileen.

934
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:07,780
:
Eileen, please wait.

935
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,050
Eileen, please.

936
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,830
I thought I could
do this alone, Eileen.

937
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,010
- Please don't go. Eileen!

938
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,050
Please, don't go. Please.

939
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,920
I thought you invited me
over here 'cause you liked me.

940
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,800
Oh, I do.

941
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:22,540
I do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please, Eileen.

942
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,150
Just pl-please, Eileen.
Just give me a moment.

943
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,630
Please just let me explain.

944
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:27,190
I need...

945
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,660
I need a friend.

946
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,470
I came here yesterday afternoon

947
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,080
to talk to Mrs. Polk.

948
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,600
I said I could see
that she was upset

949
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,080
after our meeting with Lee,

950
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,080
was there anything
she wanted to discuss.

951
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,350
She said, "Nothing," so I...

952
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:50,080
I pressed her.

953
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,170
I told her
what Lee had told me.

954
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,180
She spat at me,
called me the pervert,

955
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,880
then called her husband
a saint,

956
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,670
and I left my card,
told her to think about it.

957
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:06,440
I knew she wouldn't call.
Then I left.

958
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:11,580
Now, I couldn't sleep
last night.

959
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,070
'Cause I...

960
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,720
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Lee had told me,

961
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,250
what his father had done,

962
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,120
and how his mother
had let it happen.

963
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,950
I don't even remember the drive
over here, I was so angry.

964
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,690
Suddenly I was
pushing past her,

965
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,210
saying, "How could you do it?

966
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:30,130
How could you be complicit
in such torture?"

967
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,000
And she snapped.

968
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,390
She attacked me. See?

969
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:36,090
See?

970
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,700
So I defended myself.

971
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,880
We fought, and I...
I don't know what happened,

972
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,270
but somehow we fell down
the stairs to the basement.

973
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,840
I-I thought she
was gonna kill me,

974
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,180
so I hit her with a chair
and tied her up.

975
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:51,630
I tried to talk
to her rationally,

976
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,280
to explain that I was here
to help Lee,

977
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,760
that-that I could help her,
too, if she'd let me,

978
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,110
but... but she just
kept screaming

979
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,380
that-that I'd kidnapped her
and her husband was a cop

980
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,020
and I was gonna go to jail.

981
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,030
So I found some codeine
in a bathroom,

982
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,690
and got her to be quiet.

983
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,680
Then I called you.

984
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,600
Because, as you can see,
I'm in a bit of a pinch.

985
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:19,830
What can I do?

986
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,180
I need Mrs. Polk to confess,

987
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,310
and I need a witness,
two against one.

988
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,140
You understand?

989
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,480
Oh, I can't go to jail.

990
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,020
Okay.

991
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,550
Okay.

992
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:04,610
Wait here.

993
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,650
Eileen. Wait...

994
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,380
It's incredible.

995
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,860
Why do you have that?

996
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,120
Why did you bring that
around here?

997
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,550
My dad's sick.

998
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:41,420
Pick it up, and show me
how you're gonna hold it.

999
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,470
That's very good, Eileen.

1000
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,000
All right.

1001
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,540
Be cool.

1002
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,230
Just tell us the truth,
Mrs. Polk,

1003
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,700
and we'll let you go free.

1004
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,550
Families can heal.

1005
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:53,720
You're not a lost cause.
No one is.

1006
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,070
It can't have been easy,

1007
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,680
being married
to a man like that.

1008
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,150
You're obviously
having a hard time.

1009
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:06,390
Why don't you tell us
what happened in this house,

1010
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,650
why you helped your husband
do what he did?

1011
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,520
And then we'll be even,

1012
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,700
and we can
all walk out of here, and...

1013
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,480
and we can figure out
how to help Lee.

1014
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,580
Fucking untie me! Untie me!

1015
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,060
Let me out of here!

1016
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,020
You crazy bitch,
get out of my house!

1017
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,500
You're in big trouble,
you think you're gonna

1018
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,770
- get away with this!
- Eileen.

1019
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,810
You're going to jail
for a long time.

1020
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,120
What the hell
is she doing here?!

1021
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,690
What are you doing here?

1022
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,730
I really think you need
to tell us the truth.

1023
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,520
What the hell
are you talking about?!

1024
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:49,950
- If you don't...

1025
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,820
we could leave you
down here tied up,

1026
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,040
no one to find you.

1027
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,560
The human body
can't live very long

1028
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,260
without food and water.

1029
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,530
Sooner or later, you're
gonna need to take a shit.

1030
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,880
I guess you're just gonna
have to shit yourself.

1031
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,790
And piss.

1032
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:05,360
It's not gonna feel very good.

1033
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,740
I'm not scared of you.

1034
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:09,670
I know you.

1035
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:11,280
I know who your dad is.

1036
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,500
If you know my dad,
then you oughta be scared.

1037
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,760
Yeah? Scared of a womanizing,
drunk piece of shit

1038
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,940
who everybody knows
is batshit crazy?

1039
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,460
You think he didn't have
problems of his own?

1040
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,330
You think he didn't have
secrets of his own, huh?

1041
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:24,070
You think your mom
didn't know about 'em?

1042
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:24,990
Think it didn't...

1043
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:27,770
I am going to fucking kill you

1044
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:31,460
if you don't start talking
right now!

1045
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,910
Please!

1046
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,090
Please, don't kill me.

1047
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,650
I won't have to kill you
if you talk.

1048
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,840
:
I can't.

1049
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,280
No, please.

1050
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,460
She's not gonna help you. Talk.

1051
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,540
I can't help you
unless you confess.

1052
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,570
All right.

1053
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,780
You win.

1054
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,150
When you get married

1055
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:41,060
and you have children...

1056
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:55,600
You take an oath
when you get married

1057
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,040
to honor and obey your husband.

1058
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,330
You wouldn't understand that.

1059
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,830
At first, I...

1060
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,910
At first, I just,
I thought Mitch

1061
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:09,740
was just checking on him
in his sleep,

1062
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,480
you know,
like any father would,

1063
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,790
like he, he just wanted
to be sure

1064
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:16,570
his son was safe and sound
in bed.

1065
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,700
Sometimes I'd...

1066
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,540
...feel him getting out of bed,

1067
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:26,320
and sometimes I'd just
feel him when he'd come back.

1068
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:30,330
And he'd...

1069
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,940
kiss me or...

1070
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:35,540
hold me and...

1071
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,410
You know?

1072
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,690
And we hadn't
really been together

1073
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,290
since Lee'd been born.

1074
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,910
But then I...

1075
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:53,040
I started getting
these infections down there.

1076
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,430
I figured it was my fault.

1077
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,360
And then I wondered if Mitch

1078
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,700
had brought something home
with him, you know?

1079
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,590
Then one time...

1080
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,670
I got up
in the middle of the night.

1081
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,470
I don't remember why.

1082
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,070
Glass of water? I don't know.

1083
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:31,740
I thought-I thought
maybe it was a dream.

1084
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,470
I...

1085
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,560
I went-I went and looked in.

1086
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,620
It didn't dawn on me
right away.

1087
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,360
You know,
I-I swear to you. I...

1088
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,050
I mean...

1089
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,330
You don't expect your husband's

1090
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,980
gonna do something like that,
you know?

1091
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,670
I mean, nobody
would believe it, anyway.

1092
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,070
And then I... and then...

1093
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,300
And then I figured...

1094
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,380
And then I figured,
if Lee was clean...

1095
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:22,400
If he was clean,

1096
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,650
an enema
and a bath before bed...

1097
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:30,700
...then it would be better
for all of us.

1098
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,620
And it was.

1099
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:38,890
I knew what I was doing,
it wasn't...

1100
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,420
it wasn't quite right.

1101
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:42,890
I did know that. I did.

1102
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:46,510
But who do you tell? You know?

1103
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:48,500
Who could I tell?

1104
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:54,510
I mean,
you do the best you can.

1105
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,860
You know what happens
when you have children?

1106
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:04,000
Your husband
never looks at you the same.

1107
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,400
But after he went to bed
with Lee,

1108
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,390
he'd come to me.

1109
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,280
It was like a big burden
had been lifted.

1110
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,490
He was, he was relaxed.

1111
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:26,840
It felt good, how he'd hold me.

1112
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,760
He loved me then.

1113
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,850
He would whisper and kiss me.

1114
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,470
It was the way
it had been before...

1115
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:44,040
...when we were young
and happy and in love.

1116
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,340
It felt good.

1117
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,170
Is that so wrong...

1118
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,090
...to want to feel like that?

1119
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,490
You wouldn't understand.

1120
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:07,150
You're young, you haven't
had your heart broken.

1121
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,120
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding!

1122
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,770
Help me! Help me!

1123
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,600
Please! Plea... Help me!

1124
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,520
- : I'm bleeding!
- Shh! Shh!

1125
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,130
- Help me! You'll be sorry!
- Eileen, help me!

1126
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:25,520
I'll tell everyone
what you've done!

1127
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,520
- Eileen!
- A doctor!

1128
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,090
Get a doctor!

1129
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,220
- Get me out of here!
- Eileen, help me!

1130
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,880
Help me!

1131
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,790
No! No!

1132
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,370
:
No.

1133
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:48,060
No! No!

1134
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,590
No! No!

1135
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,550
Okay. Okay.

1136
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,550
Why did you shoot her?

1137
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,430
I was upset.

1138
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,790
What do we do now?

1139
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,010
We take her to my house.

1140
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,200
My dad's always
whipping his gun out.

1141
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,930
Everyone knows it.

1142
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:28,330
We can make it look like
he shot her in a blackout.

1143
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,170
He's just a drunk
piece of shit, right?

1144
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:36,870
He's gonna die anyway
or go crazy.

1145
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:38,960
The doctor said so.

1146
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,090
So let's take her together
and leave.

1147
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:44,910
Then we could go to New York
for the New Year...

1148
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,390
...just the two of us.

1149
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,660
I love you.

1150
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,490
It's okay.

1151
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,490
Come on.

1152
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,890
:
All right.

1153
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:17,040
: You go ahead
to your father's house.

1154
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,260
Wait for me there.

1155
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:19,690
- Yeah.
- I'll clean up inside.

1156
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:20,960
We can't leave
any evidence behind.

1157
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,120
- I'll be waiting.
- I'll be quick.

1158
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,880
Eileen.

1159
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,280
Eileen.

1160
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:31,420
Go back to sleep, Dad.

1161
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:35,070
Where you going?

1162
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:09,540
I might just get on the road.

1163
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,290
All right, then.

1164
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,290
Good night.
