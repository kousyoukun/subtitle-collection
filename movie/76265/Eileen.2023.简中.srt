20 degrees outside and snowing.

Just like it is here.

286
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,340
Don't know why I ever came back to this place.
我都不知道自己为什么会回到这个地方

287
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,600
Maybe because you had a wife and two kids.

288
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,260
Maybe.

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,570
How's that Polk kid? He talked yet?

302
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,900
Never denies it.

303
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,210
Never says a word the whole trial.
在整个审判过程中一言不发

304
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,180
Psychopathic.

305

doing something like that, now, would I?

313
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,910
ducking out.

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,290
Maybe when I'm dead and gone

and you got nobody and you never will.

They do it every year.

No, your teeth are perfect.

I don't drink coffee,

so my teeth should be fine, but...

due to my extreme propensity for sweets.

I just eat a lot of candy.

358
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,560
but most men are just too short for me.
可是对我来说，大多数男人都太矮了

359
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,120
Have you noticed, or am I imagining things,
你注意到了吗，还是我在胡思乱想？

360

that men these days are getting shorter and shorter,

balder, and fatter?

All the men around here are little boys.

The guards, the warden,

they're not much to look at.

You should have seen Dr. Frye.

He was really pretty nasty looking.

That doesn't surprise me.

My office isn't very becoming,

and it all smells of dirty leather.

I'm beginning to wonder what went on in there.

Oh. Well, you should come by sometime.

Although if the door's closed,

that means I'm with one of the boys.

Come by, and see me sometime, all right?
