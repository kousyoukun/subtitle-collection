00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,350
我想你只要带上胰岛素

72
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,970

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,460
嘿，过来，什么味道？

Yeah, 'cause she's not a hanger-on.

141
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,790
她不想跟你说话
And she doesn't want to talk to you!

142
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,150
是啊，当然，因为她有自己的生活
Yeah, sure, 'cause she's made a life of her own.

143
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,060
她已经有所成就
She's made something of herself.

144
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,420
随便吧，爸爸
Whatever, Dad.

145
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,680
过日子去吧，艾琳，找到点头绪
Get a life, Eileen. Get a clue.

146
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,020
妈的
Shit.

147
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,620
去他妈的
Fuck it.

148
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,520
好了，听着
All right, listen up!

149
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,440
众所周知，在新的一年里
As you know, in the new year,

150
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,750
我们将接受州里的审查
we will be up for state review.

151
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,190
因此，我们将收紧程序
So we're gonna be tightening our procedures

152
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,580
并根据一些重大的新想法，实施新的战略
and implementing new strategies based on some big, new ideas.

153
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,980
说到这，我左边这位新来的年轻女士
And on that note, this new young lady to my left,

154
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,590
博士，丽贝卡·圣约翰小姐
Dr. Miss Rebecca St. John,

155
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,500
是我们新来的监狱心理医生
is our new prison psychologist.

156
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,070
她刚刚完成了拉德克利夫大学的博士学位
She's just finished her doctorate at Radcliffe.

157
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,550
哈佛大学
Harvard.

158
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,150
啊，哈佛
Ah. Harvard.

159
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,900
我们可能不是哈佛人
We may not be Harvard people,

160
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,190
但我认为我们可以跟上她的步伐
but I think we can keep up with her,

161
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,520
希望她也能跟上我们的节奏
and hopefully she can keep up with us

162
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,960
就像我们跟上他们一样
as we keep up with them.

163
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,870
她也许看起来很平易近人，但我向你保证
She may be easy on the eyes, but I assure you,

164
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,190
她非常聪明
she is very smart.

165
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,100
女士们，我希望你们带圣约翰小姐四处转转...
Ladies, I hope you show Miss St. John around...

166
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,370
甜甜圈一个多少钱？
Say, how much for a glazed?

167
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,920
免费的
They're free.

168
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,190
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

169
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,370
我是丽贝卡
I'm Rebecca.

170
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,010
我知道
I know.

171
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,420
我说，这边哪里可以让女孩梳妆打扮一下呢？
Say, where can a girl get freshened up around here?

172
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,080
我可以带你去
I can show you.

173
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,360
好的，谢谢
Sure. Appreciate it.

174
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
需要帮你拿外套吗？
Can I take your jacket?

175
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,520
你真贴心，谢谢
Aren't you sweet? Thanks.

176
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,820
这边
This way.

177
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,150
我想我没听清你的名字
I don't think I caught your name.

178
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,100
艾琳
Eileen.

179
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,180
－早安　－早上好
- Morning. - Morning.

180
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,490
你从哪里来？
Where you from?

181
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,560
啊？
Huh?

182
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,180
我来自纽约
Oh, I'm from New York originally.

183
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,860
－曼哈顿
- Manhattan.

184
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,760
受不了剑桥，太紧绷了
Couldn't stand Cambridge. Way too uptight.

185
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,460
有几个人很有意思
Well, there were a couple of interesting people,

186
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,200
但是，不，我需要透口气
but, no, I needed a break.

187
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,760
呼吸点新鲜空气
Get some fresh air.

188
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,550
我喜欢海滩
And I love the beach.

189
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,470
好的
All right.

190
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,730
32...
32...

191
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,130
24...
24...

192
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,260
34
34

193
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,910
实际上是我的三围
Practically my measurements.

194
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,450
你知道，有些女性认为她们的身材
You know, some women think their figures

195
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,360
是唯一重要的事情
are the only thing that matters.

196
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,550
说实话，我觉得这有点可悲
Honestly, I think that's kind of pathetic.

197
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,180
我完全同意
I completely agree.

198
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,400
我妹妹也是这样，而且她不太聪明
My sister's like that, and she's not very smart.

199
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,970
很好，那你和我就有很多
Mm, good. Then you and I

200
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,930
比我们的身材更值得讨论的事情了
have better things to discuss than our figures.

201
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,800
就算并不是什么流行的观点
Although that isn't the popular opinion,

202
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,110
你说是不是？
wouldn't you say?

203
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,990
我不在乎流行什么
I don't care what's popular.

204
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,940
看看你
Well, look at you.

205
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,550
一个普通的凯瑟琳·赫本
A regular Katharine Hepburn.

206
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,910
如此有魄力的年轻女性实属罕见
Rare to meet a young woman with so much gumption.

207
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,140
我也是这样
I'm like that, too.

208
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,120
我才不管别人怎么想
I don't give a rat's ass what people think.

209
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,520
他们可能是怕你
They're probably scared of you.

210
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,090
呣啊
Moi?

211
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,120
好的，回头见
All right. See you around.

212
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,560
－每年
- Every year,

213
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,370
我们都举行这个特别的大会
we hold this special assembly

214
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,870
庆祝主耶稣基督的诞生
to celebrate the birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

215
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,070
而每年，你们中一个变态的混蛋
And every year, one of you sick bastards

216
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,750
都会当着其他人的面毁了它
ruins it for the rest of us.

217
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,390
那会是你们的最后一次不尊重圣诞节
Well, you've disrespected Christmas for the last time

218
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,720
因为今年，你们要安稳坐好
because this year, you're gonna sit on your hands,

219
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,530
闭上嘴巴
you're gonna zip your lips.

220
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,040
如果让我看到你们有人咬人，踢人，尖叫，推人
If I see any of you biting, kicking, screaming, pushing,

221
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,470
扯头发，大笑，呻吟
pulling hair, laughing, moaning,

222
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,550
或者我听到一句不中听的话
or I hear one wayward comment,

223
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,720
你们就直接滚回牢房里去
you're going straight to the cave.

224
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,990
现在，话不多说
And now, without further ado,

225
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,440
我很荣幸感谢奥利弗山这些
it is my honor to thank the people from Mount Olive

226
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,250
今年再次帮助我指导盛会的人们
who helped me direct the pageant again this year...

227
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,130
－耶，奥利弗山　－并向你们献上
- Yay, Mount Olive. - and present to you

228
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,200
“狱中圣诞”
"Christmas in Prison."

229
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,940
我要在圣诞节杀个人
I'm gonna kill someone on Christmas.

230
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,660
闭嘴
Shut up!

231
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,850
哦，我该怎么办？
Oh, what am I to do?

232
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,890
我被判了三年，坐在和我一样
Sentenced for three years to sit indoors

233
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,070
堕落的男孩们之中，糟透了
among boys of my same creed, plain bad.

234
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,070
－有这么多时间来策划
- So much time to plot

235
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,550
我一出来就要做点什么坏事
what evildoings I'll undertake as soon as I get out.

236
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,290
想吃蛋糕吗，胖子？
You want some cake, you fatty?!

237
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,300
有这时间，我想我可以读本书
In the meantime, I suppose I could read a book.

238
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
你不识字，混蛋
You can't read, motherfucker!

239
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
该死的莎士比亚
Fucking Shakespeare up here.

240
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,220
我现在很潦倒
I'm scrappy right now.

241
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,270
真理之书
Book of truth!

242
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,570
哦，看看麦卡利斯特
Oh, look at McAllister.

243
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,190
－该死的麦卡利斯特
- Fucking McAllister.

244
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,930
嘿，架子不错
Hey, nice rack!

245
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,590
我很累了
Well, I'm-I'm pretty tired.

246
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,590
我们能在那边的谷仓里休息吗？
Can we rest in that barn over there?

247
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,070
总比住汽车旅馆强
Better than paying for a motel.

248
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,900
你是最棒的，约瑟夫
You're the best, Joseph.

249
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,030
感谢您带我们来这里接受调查
Thank you for taking us here to be counted in the census.

250
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,160
去他妈的
Fuck this shit!

251
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,220
警卫
Guard!

252
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,490
－等等，等等，嘿，抓住他
- Wait. Wait, wait. Hey, grab him.

253
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,480
后退
Move back!

254
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,890
你们都坐下
All you guys sit down!

255
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,500
给我坐下
Sit the fuck down!

256
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,760
嘿，鲍勃
Hey, Bob.

257

这个和一包好彩
This and a pack of Luckies.

259
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,250
今天真幸运，是吧？
Oh! It's a lucky day, huh?

260
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,900
是啊，最幸运的
Yeah, the luckiest.

261
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,430
是的，香烟是好东西
Yup. Cigarettes are great.

262
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,520
别把你自己点着了
Don't light yourself on fire.

263
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,400
你心情这么好，怎么了？
You're in a good mood, what's wrong with you?

264
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,580
没事，爸爸
Nothing's wrong, Dad.

265
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,620
你嘴里叼着那个东西，看起来很滑稽
You look funny with that thing in your mouth.

266
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,370
今天过得怎么样，爸爸？
How was your day, Dad?

267
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,990
我今天过得怎么样？
How was my day?

268
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,110
我不知道
I don't know.

269
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,940
就是一天，又一天
It was a day, just another day.

270
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,510
有什么意义？
What's the point?

271
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,380
我今天过得很糟糕
My day was a doozy.

272
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,940
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

273
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,740
圣诞庆典上发生了一场大战
A big fight broke out at the Christmas pageant.

274
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,520
小伙的锁骨断了
Kid got his collarbone broken,

275
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,520
我不得不为典狱长做这些文书工作
and I had to do all this paperwork for the warden.

276
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,180
别把烟灰搞在地板上，踩得到处都是
Don't ash on the floor, it's tacky.

277
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,660
总之...
Anyway...

278
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,950
这是让人终生难忘的一天
It was one of those days you never forget.

279
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,020
哦，是吗？我永远不会忘记的日子
Oh, yeah? Days I'll never forget.

280
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,390
让我想想
Let me see.

281
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,190
1944，年，12，月，16，日
December 16, 1944,

282
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,630
这是我第一次把死人的头抱在腿上
first time I ever held a dead man's head in my lap.

283
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,860
真是可惜啊
What a waste.

284
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,580
室外气温，20，度，正在下雪
20 degrees outside and snowing.

285
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,660
就像这里一样
Just like it is here.

286
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,340
我都不知道自己为什么会回到这个地方
Don't know why I ever came back to this place.

287
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,600
也许是因为你有妻子和两个孩子
Maybe because you had a wife and two kids.

288
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,260
也许吧
Maybe.

289
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,210
我爱海滩
I love the beach.

290
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,430
哦，是吗？对你有好处
Oh, yeah? Good for you.

291
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,540
战争毁了我的海滩
War kind of ruined beaches for me.

292
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,890
还有什么？
So what else?

293
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,570
那个叫波尔克的孩子怎么样了？他交代了吗？
How's that Polk kid? He talked yet?

294
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,620
啊？
Huh?

295
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,960
波尔克
Polk.

296
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,120
刺死父亲的那个孩子
The kid who stabbed his father...

297
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,760
他爸一个好警察，或多或少的
who was a good cop, more or less.

298
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,990
什么样的孩子会想这样杀死自己的父亲？
What kind of kid thinks of killing his father like that?

299
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,410
在他睡觉时捅他一刀...
Stab him in his sleep...

300
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,170
在他母亲面前
in front of his mother.

301
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,010
然后他就坐下了
Then he just sits down.

302
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,900
从不否认
Never denies it.

303
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,210
在整个审判过程中一言不发
Never says a word the whole trial.

304
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,180
心理变态
Psychopathic.

305
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,170
我当然不用担心你
Course I wouldn't have to worry about you

306
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,090
会做出这样的事情，现在，对吧？
doing something like that, now, would I?

307
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,220
因为你是个女孩
'Cause you're a girl.

308
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,570
无法想象你拿着刀的样子
Can't imagine you with a knife.

309
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,750
你能想象我拿着枪的样子吗？
Can you imagine me with a gun?

310
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,220
是的，我能想象
Yeah, I can see it.

311
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,670
有一天...
One day...

312
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,060
当你受够了，觉得想要...
when you've had enough and you feel like, uh...

313
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,910
一了百了
ducking out.

314
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,290
也许等我死了以后
Maybe when I'm dead and gone

315
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,370
你谁也没有了，孤独终老
and you got nobody and you never will.

316
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,250
我能想象得到
I could imagine that.

317
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,820
但你不会的，对吧？
But you wouldn't, would you?

318
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,430
因为你太厉害了
'Cause you're too good.

319
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,300
给我一支烟
Say, give me one of those cigarettes.

320
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,350
你买的什么，Old，Gold？
What have you got, Old Gold?

321
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,790
不是
No.

322
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,270
我喜欢Old，Gold
I like Old Gold.

323
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,100
我知道
I know.

324
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,290
哎呀
Oopsie.

325
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,730
需要帮助吗？
Do you need any help?

326
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,770
不，我没事
Uh, no, I'm okay.

327
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,250
就是手太滑
Just butterfingers.

328
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,340
你还没看过我呢
You should see me.

329
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,910
我笨手笨脚的
I'm a total klutz.

330
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,050
哦，对了
Oh, right.

331
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,400
李·波尔克
Lee Polk.

332
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,830
这可不是每天都能看到的
That's not something you see every day.

333
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,010
是的，很糟糕
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

334
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,220
睡前阅读？
Bedtime reading?

335
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,910
我只是在整理文件
I was just doing some filing.

336
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,930
昨天的表演真精彩
That's some show yesterday.

337
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,680
他们每年都这样
They do it every year.

338
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,940
我看这是很残忍和不寻常的惩罚
I'd call that cruel and unusual punishment.

339
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,080
对不起，我通常不抽烟
Sorry. I don't usually smoke.

340
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,690
一个令人讨厌的习惯
It's a nasty habit.

341
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,300
所以我才喜欢
That's why I like it.

342
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,830
不过，这可不太淑女
Not very becoming of a lady, though.

343
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,560
会让牙齿变黄
Turns your teeth yellow.

344
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,660
看到了吗？
See?

345
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,720
香烟和咖啡
That's cigarettes and coffee.

346
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,270
还有红酒搞的
And red wine.

347
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,170
不，你的牙齿很完美
No, your teeth are perfect.

348
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,280
我不喝咖啡
I don't drink coffee,

349
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,540
所以我的牙齿本该没问题的，但是...
so my teeth should be fine, but...

350
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,020
都烂了
they're all rotted

351
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,370
因为我特别爱吃甜食
due to my extreme propensity for sweets.

352
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,850
喜欢甜食
A propensity for sweets.

353
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,960
你的生活还不够甜蜜吗？
You don't get enough sweetness in your life?

354
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,760
我只是吃了很多糖果
I just eat a lot of candy.

355
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,160
嗯，还真看不出来
Mm. I wouldn't know it to look at you.

356
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,470
你真娇小
You're so petite.

357
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,470
当然，个子高也有个子高的好处
Being tall has its advantages, of course,

358
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,560
可是对我来说，大多数男人都太矮了
but most men are just too short for me.

359
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,120
你注意到了吗，还是我在胡思乱想？
Have you noticed, or am I imagining things,

360
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,520
现在的男人越来越矮
that men these days are getting shorter and shorter,

361
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,920
还更秃，更胖了？
balder, and fatter?

362
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,420
这里所有的男人都是小年轻
All the men around here are little boys.

363
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,020
你真有趣
You're funny.

364
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,790
我是说在监狱外面
I meant outside this prison.

365
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,030
虽然你说得对
Although you're right.

366
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,190
守卫们，典狱长
The guards, the warden,

367
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,760
真的让人看不上
they're not much to look at.

368
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,840
你应该去看看弗莱医生
You should have seen Dr. Frye.

369
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,440
他长得真的很猥琐
He was really pretty nasty looking.

370
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,370
我对此并不感到惊讶
That doesn't surprise me.

371
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,550
我的办公室并不宽敞
My office isn't very becoming,

372
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,600
散发着肮脏皮革的味道
and it all smells of dirty leather.

373
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,390
我开始怀疑里面到底发生了什么
I'm beginning to wonder what went on in there.

374
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,160
没什么好事
Nothing good.

375
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,090
我是说，我从未真正进过那间办公室
I mean, I never actually been in that office.

376
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,080
哦，你有空应该过来看看
Oh. Well, you should come by sometime.

377
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,260
不过如果门是关着的
Although if the door's closed,

378
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,520
说明我和其中一个男孩在
that means I'm with one of the boys.

379
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,000
好的
Okay.

380
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,480
你难道不害怕吗？
Aren't you ever scared

381
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,700
一个人和他们在一起？
being alone in there with them?

382
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,290
不
No.

383
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,440
有空来找我，好吗？
Come by, and see me sometime, all right?

384
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,390
不过，如果你听到我在里面尖叫的话
Although, you know, if you hear me screaming in there,

385
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,250
请随时踢门救我
feel free to kick down the door and rescue me.

386
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,620
好的
Okay.

387
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,680
我开玩笑的，亲爱的
I'm just kidding, honey.

388
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,050
有警报器的
There's a buzzer.

389
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,550
我是来见伦纳德·波尔克的
I'm here to see Leonard Polk.

390
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,240
安妮·波尔克
Anne Polk.

391
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,910
你不在日程表上
You're not on the schedule.

392
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,300
你是最近才预约的吗？
Are you a late addition?

393
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,350
我是被叫来的
I was called.

394
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,490
我不知道，我现在就在这里
I don't know, I-I'm here now.

395
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
你需要填写一份表格
Well, you need to fill out a form.

396
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,860
你不是邓洛普警长的孩子吗？
Aren't you Chief Dunlop's kid?

397
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,100
是啊
Yeah.

398
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,450
我想也是
I thought so.

399
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,550
波尔克夫人？我是圣约翰医生
Mrs. Polk? I'm Dr. St. John.

400
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,880
我们通过电话，非常感谢你能来
We spoke on the phone. Thank you so much for coming.

401
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,170
哦，没必要这么麻烦
Oh, no need to bother with that.

402
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,190
我们都知道你是谁
We all know who you are.

403
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,120
艾琳，你能帮我们开门吗？
Eileen, would you help us with the door?

404
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,460
谢谢
Thank you.

405
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
－这边走
- It's this way.

406
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,310
拿上你的外套？
Take your coat?

407
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,240
请
Please.

408
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,650
谢谢你，艾琳
Thank you, Eileen.

409
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,160
你先请
After you.

410
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,150
你为什么要这样对我？
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,810
啊？
Huh?

412
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,750
你有话要跟我说吗？
You got something to say to me?

413
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,930
让我出去
Let me out!

414
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,190
让我出去，让我出去
Let me out! Let me out!

415
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,760
让我出去
Let me out!

416
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,070
你们...你们想怎么处置就怎么处置吧
Y-You do... y'all do what you want with him.

417
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,290
连和自己的母亲都不肯说一句？
Won't even talk to his own mother?

418
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,290
他一直是个讨厌的孩子
He's always been a nasty boy.

419
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,070
一个肮脏讨厌的孩子
A filthy, nasty boy!

420
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,760
我要锁门了
I need to lock up.

421
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,820
实际上，探视时间已经超了20分钟
Visitation hours were actually over 20 minutes ago.

422
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,260
哦，我明白了
Oh, I-I understand.

423
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,430
你想到我的办公室里继续聊聊吗？
Would you like to keep talking in my office?

424
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,310
－我们走　－转过去
- Let's go. - Turn around.

425
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,660
哦，不用了，没这个必要
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

426
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,230
－我得把他铐起来　－不
- I need to cuff him. - No.

427
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,250
别担心，李，没事的
Don't worry, Lee. It's all right.

428
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,980
没有这个必要
That won't be necessary.

429
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,030
别这样，她是个医生
Don't do that. She's a doctor.

430
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,290
我觉得她需要看医生
I think she needs a doctor.

431
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,760
那孩子杀了警察
That kid killed a cop.

432
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,530
他杀死了他的父亲
He killed his father.

433
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,820
不一样的
There's a difference.

434
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,210
哦，真对不起，让我看看是谁
Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me see who it is.

435
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,350
哦，艾琳
Oh, Eileen.

436
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,600
有什么能帮您的吗？
Um, can I help you?

437
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,400
你忘带笔记本了
You forgot your notebook.

438
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,050
哦，太谢谢你了
Oh, thank you so much.

439
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,360
我真的需要这个
I actually need this.

440
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,270
嗯，希望你没读过
Um, hope you didn't read it.

441
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,770
－不，当然不是　－当然没有
- No, of course not. - Oh, no,

442
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,710
我开玩笑的，只是胡乱划了几笔
I'm just kidding. It's just chicken scratch.

443
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,930
等等，艾琳
Wait. Eileen.

444
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,850
我并不是想太强势
I don't mean to be forward,

445
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,030
而且，嗯，你可能已经有其他计划了
and, um, you probably have other plans already,

446
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,290
不过，今晚我能请你喝一杯吗？
but, um, can I take you to a drink tonight?

447
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,030
我在这该死的镇子里一个人都不认识
I don't know anyone in this darn town,

448
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,080
如果你愿意，我很乐意请你喝鸡尾酒
and I'd love to treat you to a cocktail if you're game.

449
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,770
－好的　－好的
- Okay. - Okay?

450
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,120
－不会太为难吧？
- I've twisted your arm?

451
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,520
那么，哪家的马提尼最好喝？
So, uh, who makes the best martini in town?

452
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,430
－也许是奥哈拉酒吧？　－奥哈拉酒吧？
- Maybe O'Hara's? - O'Hara's.

453
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,830
实际上，这是镇上唯一一家酒吧
It's actually the only bar in town.

454
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,090
好，奥哈拉酒吧就可以
No, O'Hara's is good.

455
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,570
7，点见？
See you at 7:00?

456
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,350
准点见？是这么说吗？
With bells on? Is that the expression?

－嗨　－艾琳
- Hi. - Oh, Eileen.

481
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,520
你好
Hi.

482
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,740
请坐下
Please, please, please, sit.

483
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,610
你要喝什么？
Um, what are you having?

484
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,050
呃，我想我还是喝啤酒吧
Uh, I'll have a beer, I guess.

485
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,610
啤酒？哦
A beer? Oh.

486
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,920
嗨，艾琳
Hi, Eileen.

487
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,390
很高兴见到你，亲爱的
Good to see you, hon.

488
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,140
来点什么，亲爱的？
What's next, sweetheart?

489
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,580
嗯...我的天啊
Um, well... Oh, my stars.

490
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,270
你绝对冻僵了
You're absolutely frozen.

491
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,580
请给我一杯啤酒，也许再来点威士忌
Um, one beer, please, and maybe a little whiskey

492
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,020
温暖温暖我的女孩，怎么样？
to warm up my girl. What say, huh?

493
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,720
天哪，你看起来真迷人
My, you look very glamorous.

494
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,940
这只是一件旧衣服
It's just an old dress.

495
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,070
可以吗？
May I?

496
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,820
你呢，亲爱的？再来杯马提尼？
How about you, sweetheart? Another martini?

497
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,250
来一个，谢谢
Love one. Thank you.

498
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,820
也许这次我们可能要多喝两杯
Maybe let's hold the olives this time.

499
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,780
我本以为这个地方很难找
I thought I'd have a hard time finding this place,

500
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,430
但也不难嘛
but here it is.

501
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,530
你还好吗？
You feeling all right?

502
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,790
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

503
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,450
我的车有点问题
Uh, there's something wrong with my car,

504
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,400
所以我必须开着窗开车
so I have to drive with the windows down,

505
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,230
否则就会烟雾弥漫
or else it fills with smoke.

506
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,580
－哦，开玩笑
- Oh, you're kidding.

507
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,320
这听起来太可怕了
That sounds absolutely awful.

508
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,190
你就不能让你丈夫帮你修好吗？
Can't you get your husband to fix that for you?

509
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,330
哦，不，我还没结婚
Oh, no, I'm not married.

510
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,200
我一直都是单身
I've always been single.

511
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,850
当我身边有男人的时候
And when I do have a guy around,

512
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,900
只是为了好玩，从不长久
it's just for fun, and it's brief.

513
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,210
不，我从不在一个地方为任何人驻足
No, I never stay anywhere long with anything.

514
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,430
我的生活方式
Sort of my modus vivendi

515
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,410
或我的病态，要看是在跟谁聊了
or my pathology, depending on who I'm talking to.

516
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,260
你在摩尔黑德工作多久了？
How long have you worked at Moorehead?

517
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,000
三四年
Three or four years.

518
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,790
呃，本来只是暂时的
Uh, it was only supposed to be temporary,

519
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,010
母亲生病期间，我搬回来住了一段时间
while I moved back for a bit while my mother was sick,

520
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,400
然后她去世了，所以
and then she died, so...

521
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,320
我就一直在监狱，时间过得飞快
I've been at the prison, and time's just flown by.

522
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,800
哦，上帝啊
Oh, God.

523
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,060
监狱可不是时光飞逝的地方
Prison is no place for time to fly by.

524
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,410
还有你母亲的去世
And your mother dying.

525
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,070
对一位年轻女士来说，这已经够多了
That's a lot for a young lady.

526
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,680
啊，24岁
Ah. 24.

527
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,770
那你一定很想再出去走走，是吗？
Then you must be eager to get back out there. Are you?

528
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,860
你知道，嗯，我也是个孤儿
You know, um, I'm an orphan, too.

529
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,650
我叔叔在西部把我抚养长大
My uncle raised me out West.

530
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,300
阳光普照的地方
Where the sun shines.

531
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,090
我不明白你们是怎么做到的
I don't understand how you all do it here,

532
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,700
一个冬天又一个冬天
winter after winter.

533
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,180
真的是冻死人了，我也不知道
It's positively creepy. I don't know.

534
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,440
我对新英格兰有着一种奇怪的情结
I'm in a sort of strange love affair with New England.

535
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,660
我喜欢它，但也讨厌它
I love it, but I also hate it.

536
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,530
这里的一切都很真实，不是吗？
Things feel very real here, don't they?

537
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,710
算是没有...
Sort of there's no...

538
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,190
想象力
imagination.

539
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,930
没有感伤，也没有幻想
There's no sentimentality or fantasy.

540
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,200
这里...这里无处可藏
There's... there's just nowhere to hide.

541
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,340
对不起
Sorry.

542
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,250
我喝多了
I've had too much to drink.

543
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,470
我一喝多就爱说话
I tend to talk when I've had too much to drink.

544
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,860
没事的
It's all right.

545
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,520
嗯，总比不说话要好
Mm, it's better than talking too little.

546
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,870
你今天看到李·波尔克了吗？
Did you see Lee Polk today?

547
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,440
呃...
Uh...

548
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,000
她跟你说什么了吗？
Did she say anything to you?

549
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,870
波尔克夫人？
Mrs. Polk?

550
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,140
她只是心烦意乱
She was just upset.

551
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,620
那些母亲总是不高兴
Those mothers are always upset.

552
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,930
嗯
Mm-hmm.

553
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,360
你觉得她是个愤怒的女人吗？
Did she seem like an angry woman to you?

554
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,840
我不知道呃...
I don't know. Uh...

555
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,320
大家都很生气
everyone's kind of angry here.

556
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,930
－这里是马萨诸塞　－嗯
- It's Massachusetts. - Mm.

557
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,290
我在哈佛有个教授
Well, I had this professor at Harvard.

558
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,330
他才华横溢，但非常难相处
He was brilliant, but very difficult.

559
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:22,600
呃，他在囚犯身上做了这些
Uh, he did this... these experiments on prisoners

560
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,820
研究迷幻药对累犯的影响的实验
studying the effects of psychedelics on recidivism.

561
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,080
我不同意他的方法
Now, I don't agree with his methods,

562
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,340
世上没有灵丹妙药
there is no magic pill,

563
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,020
但是...但是你可以给人们带来自由...
but... but you can set people free...

564
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,530
如果你能让他们说出真相，感受到真相
if you can get them to tell the truth, to feel it.

565
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,220
这就是我想做的
That's what I want to do.

566
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,360
秘密与谎言
Secrets and lies.

567
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,600
我告诉你，娃娃...
I tell you, doll...

568
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,280
有些家庭太变态了，太扭曲了
some families are so sick, so twisted,

569
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,970
唯一的出路就是有人死掉
the only way out's for someone to die.

570
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,540
你觉得呢？
Don't you think?

571
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,770
你说你叫什么名字？
Hey! What'd you say your name was?

572
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,810
谁？
Who, me?

573
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,780
是啊，我们刚才正在聊
Ah, yeah. W-We was just saying

574
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,290
你看起来这么熟悉
that you look so familiar.

575
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,120
你拍过电影吗？
Are you in the movies or something?

576
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,770
很难说，我在男子监狱工作
Hardly. I work at the boys' prison.

577
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,900
－我是艾琳
- I'm Eileen,

578
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,180
这是我的朋友丽贝卡
and this is my friend, Rebecca.

579
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,810
她是个心理医生
She's a psychologist.

580
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,950
别害羞，丽贝卡
Don't be shy, Rebecca.

581
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,120
这些孩子不会咬人
These boys won't bite.

582
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,690
除非你要求我们这样做
Not unless you ask us to.

583
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,430
这是杰瑞，你可以无视他
This is Jerry. You can ignore him.

584
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,480
他结婚了
He's married.

585
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,960
你的牙齿怎么了，杰瑞？
What happened to your teeth, Jerry?

586
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,830
你和你老婆吵架了？
You get into a fight with your old lady?

587
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,790
就是这样，他老婆的左手和乔·弗雷泽一样壮
That's it. His wife's got a left like Joe Frazier.

588
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,140
不，不，他...他在冰上滑倒了
Nah, nah. He... he slipped on the ice.

589
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,660
不过，我会再种几颗新的
I'm gonna grow some new ones, though.

590
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,230
嗯
Mm-hmm.

591
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,800
只要再多来几杯这个
Just need a few more of these.

592
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,890
干杯，为杰瑞和他的新牙干杯
Cheers to that. To Jerry and his new teeth.

593
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,410

爸爸，能让我进去吗？
Dad, can you let me in?

658

妈的
Shit.

659
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,560
嘿，爸爸
Hey, Dad!

660
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,930
能把钥匙给我吗？
Can I have the keys?

661
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,020
能请你把钥匙给我吗？
Can I please have the keys?

662
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,630
不行，不能给你钥匙
No, you may not have the keys.

663
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,500
除非你从头到尾读完这本书
Not until you read that book from cover to cover.

664
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,590
一字不漏的
I want to hear every word.

665
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,800
你把钥匙放哪儿了？
Where'd you put the keys?

666
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,910
请随意，艾琳
Make yourself comfortable, Eileen.

667
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,780

You're not going anywhere till you read the last word.

668
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,090
爸爸，这太荒唐了，我得去上班了
Dad, this is ridiculous. I need to go to work.

669
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,310

Out all night.

670
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,880
差点撞车
Nearly crashed the car.

671
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,010
睡在自己的病床上
Sleeping in your own sick,

672
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,140
现在你开始担心不能准时上班了？
and now you're worried about getting to work on time?

673
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,120
我都没眼看你，太丢人了
I can hardly look at you, I'm so ashamed.

674
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,770
奥利弗·忒斯特会对这个家感激不尽
Oliver Twist would be grateful for this home,

675
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,670
但是你，艾琳
but you, Eileen,

676
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,190
你是垃圾，艾琳，就是垃圾
you're trash, Eileen, just trash.

677
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,670
我不过就是和一个女同事去聚了个会
All I did was go out with a girl from work.

678
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,020
你和一个女同事聚会了？
You went out with a girl from work?

679
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,460
我看起来像昨天才出生的吗？
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

680
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,160
他是谁？
Who is he? Huh?

681
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,330
这个男孩是谁？我只想知道他是谁
Who is this boy? I just want to know who he is

682
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,290
在你怀孕并把灵魂出卖给撒旦之前
before you get knocked up and sell your soul to Satan.

683
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,730
你能把钥匙给我吗？
Can you just give me the keys?

684
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,420
求你了，我要迟到了
Please! I'll be late!

685
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,510
你穿成这样哪儿也去不了
You're not going anywhere dressed like that.

686
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,860
我的意思是，真的，艾琳，你怎么敢的？
I mean, really, Eileen, how dare you?

687
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,690
那是你母亲在爷爷葬礼上穿的衣服
That's the dress your mother wore to my father's funeral.

688
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,870
你不尊重任何人
You got no respect for anyone.

689
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,350
赶紧换了
Get changed.

690
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,840
我不想让任何人看到你穿成这样
I don't want anyone seeing you in that getup.

691
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,350
他们会以为我死了
They'll think I'm dead.

692
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,500
邓洛普小姐？
Ah. Miss Dunlop?

693
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,300
我能说句话吗？
May I, um, may I have a word?

694
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,150
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

695
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,600
是关于你父亲的
It's about your father.

696
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,850
他？去和他谈谈，他在里面
Him? Go talk to him. He's inside.

697
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,340
是关于他的枪
It's about his gun.

698
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:38,990
应该没事
This oughta be good.

699
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,630
请告诉我，巴克
Pray tell, Buck.

700
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,680
呃，昨天
Uh, yesterday,

701
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,740
我们收到了几位邻居的投诉
we got several complaints from neighbors,

702
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,730
据学校的康妮小姐所说
from Miss Connie down at the school,

703
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,150
邓洛普警长
that, uh, Chief Dunlop

704
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,560
坐在朝北的窗前
was sitting in that north-facing window

705
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,130
用武器指着
and, uh, pointing his weapon

706
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,130
放学回家的孩子们
to children walking home from school.

707
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,730
他已同意将枪支交由您照管
He has agreed to relinquish the property into your care.

708
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,320
只要你保证不会拿来用在他身上
As long as you promise not to use it on him.

709
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:03,790
他的话
His words.

710
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,030
我可以进去吗？
May I come in?

711
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,980
想把那玩意像装饰品一样挂在我身上吗？
Want to hang it on me like an ornament?

712
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,190
我相信邓洛普小姐
I'm sure that Miss Dunlop

713
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,320
会好好保管武器的，长官
will take excellent care of the weapon, sir.

714
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,670
就像她对所有事情的态度一样，巴克，你也看到了
As she does with all things, Buck, as you can see.

Let me know which ones.

724
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,970
好的，我等着
Sure. I'll hold.

725
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,710
啊，看那只猫叼来了什么？
Ah, look what the cat dragged in.

726
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,060
－下午好，艾琳
- Good afternoon, Eileen.

727
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,240
你看起来像雏菊一样鲜艳，一如既往
You look fresh as a daisy, as always.

728
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,500
我的车出了问题
I had car trouble.

729
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,150
是的，我相信有问题
Yeah, I believe the trouble part.

730
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,550
都快圣诞节了，你能放我一马吗？
It's almost Christmas. Can you give me a break?

731
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,430
不，赶紧去工作
No. Get to work.

732
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,600
好的，我需要波尔克的文件
Okay. I need the Polk file.

733
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,120
－是啊
- Yeah.

734
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,160
我估计圣约翰医生拿着呢
I think Dr. St. John has it.

735
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,650
好极了，是的，恐怕那个
Perfect. Yeah, I'm afraid that one

736
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,690
只能等到假期结束后了
will have to wait till after the holidays.

737
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,340
我们新来了一位医生
We have a new doctor on staff,

738
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,830
显然她不遵守程序
and, uh, apparently she doesn't follow procedures.

739
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:26,830
－她今天没来？－已经走了
- She's not in today? - Been and gone.

740
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,090
她圣诞节后才会回来
She's gonna be back after Christmas.

741
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,320
好的，好的
Yeah. Will do.

742
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,790
那好吧，谢谢
All right, then. Thank you.

743
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,140
再见
Bye-bye.

744
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,320
你想去哪儿？
Where do you think you're going?

745
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,040
医务室
The infirmary.

746
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,410
我觉得有些事情正在发生
I think something's going around.

747
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,280
看起来好像你才有事
You look like you've been going around.

748
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,630
她是个酒鬼
She's a boozer.

749
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,170
爸爸？
Dad?

750
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,510
爸爸？
Dad?

751
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,740
爸爸？
Dad?

752
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,010
－爸爸，你能听到我吗？
- Dad, can you hear me?

753
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,570
爸爸，你能听到我吗？
Dad, can you hear me?

754
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,360
－你在上面干什么？－我需要我的枪
- What were you doing up there? - I need my gun.

755
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,450
－坐起来　－它在追我
- Sit up. - It's after me.

756
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,450
没人追杀你
Nobody's after you.

757
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,100
坐起来，坐起来
Sit up. Sit up.

758
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,830
琼妮
Joanie.

759
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,780
是你吗，琼妮？
That you, Joanie?

760
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,590
嘿
Hey.

761
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,550
琼妮，琼妮
Joanie. Joanie.

762
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,160
琼妮
Joanie.

763
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,860
爸爸
Dad.

764
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,230
别大惊小怪的，琼妮
Quit your fussing, Joanie.

765
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,460
我们给他缝合了伤口
We stitched him up,

766
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,100
我不认为他有脑震荡
and I don't think he has a concussion,

767
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,580
但他血液中的酒精含量
but his blood alcohol level

768
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,830
是，1-7，点
is point one-seven.

769
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,290
他的肝脏肿大，浑身是伤
His liver's enlarged, and he's covered in bruises.

770
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,180
我不是责怪你，亲爱的，但是...
I'm not blaming you, honey, but, uh...

771
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:03,150
是的，当然
Yeah, sure.

772
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,890
嘿，是谁让他这样生活的？
Hey, who's letting him live like this?

773
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,190
我不知道，我妈妈去世了，他也没有工作
I don't know. My mom died, and he doesn't have a job.

774
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,730
他还能做什么？
What else is he supposed to do?

775
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,430
是的，也有些男人不会整天喝酒的
Yeah, there are men who don't drink all day.

776
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,330
我知道
I know that.

777
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:16,070
听着，我知道这对你来说很难，但是...
Look, I know this is hard for you, but, uh...

778
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,380
如果他不喝酒，可能会死
if he stops drinking, he might die,

779
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,120
但如果他继续喝下去，肯定会要了他的命的
but if he keeps drinking, it'll definitely kill him.

780
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,120
我不知道还能对你说什么
I don't know what else to say to you.

781
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,380
坐下，爸爸
Sit down, Dad.

782
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,640
医生说你快死了
The doctor told me you're gonna die.

783
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,370
哦，好像他不会死似的
Oh, like he's not?

784
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,680
他说，如果你继续这样喝下去
He said, if you keep drinking like this,

785
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,740
会害死你的
it'll kill you.

786
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,160
去他的
Screw him.

787
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,750
你知道他们那家医院害死了你母亲
You know they killed your mother at that hospital.

788
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,470
他们欠我的不是缝几针就完了的
They owe me more than stitches.

789
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,220
你能往后靠吗？
Can you lean back?

790
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,600
我当然可以往后靠
Course I can lean back.

791
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,620
你以为我不知道怎么上床睡觉吗？
You don't think I know how to go to bed?

792
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,640
我要喝一杯
Well, I need a drink.

793
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,820
爸爸
Dad!

794
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,500
总之，我不要在这睡
And anyway, I do not sleep here.

795
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,370
－这闹鬼　－求你了，爸爸
- It's haunted. - Please, Dad.

796
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,850
如果我给你拿一瓶，你会躺下吗？
If I get you a bottle, will you lie down?

797
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,900
不，我想和我女儿喝一杯
No. I want to have a drink with my daughter.

798
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,740
这些天你变了
You're different these days.

799
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,720
你有趣多了
You're almost interesting.

800
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,470
你工作赚来的钱花哪里去了？
What are you doing with all the money you make at work?

801
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,240
你为什么不给自己买点衣服？
Why don't you ever buy your own clothes?

802
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,510
我记得那件大衣
I remember that coat.

803
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,650
我记得你的母亲...
I remember your mother...

804
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,170
我穿起来怎么样？
How does it look on me?

805
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,210
你妈妈穿那件大衣真漂亮
Well, your mother looked beautiful in that coat.

806
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,130
我买给她
I bought it for her to wear

807
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,480
出院的时候穿的
when she got out of the bughouse.

808
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,930
我一直很爱你的母亲
I always loved your mother.

809
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,970
不管你觉得这看起来像什么样子
No matter what you thought it looked like,

810
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,340
我一直很爱她
I always loved her.

811
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,790
我知道人们是怎么说我的
And I know what people say about me.

812
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,940
他们说是我把她逼疯的，因为我是个硬茬子
They say I made her crazy 'cause I'm a hard-ass.

813
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,160
我可能还大喊了几次
And I may have yelled a few times,

814
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,880
但她总是会原谅我
but she always forgave me.

815
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,730
因为我们彼此相爱
Because we loved each other.

816
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,230
爱会让你疯狂，艾琳
Love will make you crazy, Eileen.

817
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:33,710
你可能永远都不会明白
You'll probably never understand that.

818
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,280
为什么？
Why?

819
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,880
有些人...
Some people...

820
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,940
他们才是真正的人
they're the real people.

821
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,480
就像电影一样，你看到的就是他们
Like in a movie, they're the ones you're watching.

822
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,560
他们在行动
They're the ones making moves.

823
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,780
而其他人...
And the other people...

824
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,900
他们只是在那里滥竽充数
they're just there filling the space,

825
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:00,340
而你却认为这是理所当然的
and you take 'em for granted.

826
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,720
你觉得，“这谁不会啊”
You think, "They're easy."

827
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,300
挣点钱，花点钱
Take a penny, leave a penny.

828
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,660
这就是你，艾琳
That's you, Eileen.

829
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,400
你就是其中之一
You're one of them.

830
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,410
你在干什么？不用锁门
What are you doing? You don't gotta lock it.

831
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,150
－我们走吧
- Let's go.

832
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,500
－来吧，来吧
- Come on. Come on.

833
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,280
来吧，外面很冷
Come on. It's cold out here.

834
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,290
快点，快点
Come on. Hurry up.

835
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,420
开门
Open the door.

836
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,680
真他妈重
Fucking heavy.

837
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,410
把他妈的酒给我
Give me my fucking drink.

838
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,500
艾琳
Eileen!

839
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,170
艾琳
Eileen!

840
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,600
什么，爸爸？
What, Dad?

841
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,210
电话响了

有个女人在找你

843
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,000
你说什么？
What'd you say?

00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,130
什么都没有
Nothing.

845
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,650
我什么都不知道，我什么也没说

846

00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,860
听着，我只是在想你
Look, I was just thinking of you,

850
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,100
我不知道
and, well, I-I don't know

851
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,540
你平安夜有什么计划
what you're planning for Christmas Eve,

852
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,540
但我想也许你愿意过来
but I thought maybe you'd like to come over.

853
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,320
我们可以播放一些唱片
There are some records we could play,

854
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,660
如果一切顺利，也许还能再跳一次舞
and maybe dance again if all goes well.

855
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,550
当然，除非你有更好的提议
Unless you have a better offer, of course.

856
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,890
我没有更好的提议
I don't have a better offer.

857
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,900
－那你会来吗？－好啊

908
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,540
让我们看看开瓶器藏在哪里
Let's see where the corkscrew's hiding.

909
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,460

我最近太忙了
I have just been so busy lately

我似乎记不起在哪里...
that I can't seem to remember where the...

912
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,550
但它一定就在这些乱七八糟的东西下面，对吗？
But it's got to be here under all this mess, right?

913
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,380
你知道吗？
You know what?

914
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,340
一位心灵手巧的年轻博士生曾经教过我一招
A very handy young PhD student once taught me a trick

915
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,690
如何打开一个酒瓶，如果你
for how to open a bottle if you're ever stranded

916
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,390
没有开瓶器的话
without a corkscrew.

917
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,280
哲学家一直是最大的酒鬼
Philosophers are always the biggest drunks.

我不知道你还能这么做
I had no idea you could do that.

921
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,060
这一招真不错
That was a great trick.

922
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,980
嗯
Mm-hmm.

923
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,540
现在我们需要一些酒杯
Now we need some glasses.

924
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,110
啊
Ah.

925
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,720
艾琳，我的圣诞救星
So to Eileen, my Christmas savior.

Savior?

我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

不
No.

哦，当然
Oh, uh, sure.

943
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,680
我...不，我不能有室友
I, uh... No, I can't have roommates.

944
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,820
我喜欢自己的空间
I, um, I like my own space.

945
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,210
我还是喜欢找乐子
I still like to have fun,

946
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,470
而且，我可能还会很吵
and, uh, I can make a lot of noise.

947
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,910
而且，你也看到了，我搞得一团糟
And, uh, I can make a mess, as you can see,

948
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:53,560
但是，我想放多大声就放多大声
but, uh, I can play music as loud as I want to.

949
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,870
我可以...
I can...

我可以尽情尖叫
I can scream as loud as I want to.

我也受不了室友
I can't stand roommates, either.

952
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,840
在大学里，我不得不把门锁上...
In college, I had to lock my door...

953
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,800
对了，你上过大学
Oh, that's right. You were in college.

你学的什么？
What'd you study?

955
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,490
只是些必修课
Just the required courses.

956
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,470
嗯，如果我没有离开
Um, if I hadn't left,

957
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,800
最终我可能都会成为一名秘书
I probably would have ended up a secretary anyway.

958
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,500
艾琳，你不是一个真正的秘书
Eileen, you're not really a secretary.

959
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,200
默里太太和史蒂文斯太太，她们是秘书
Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Stevens, they're secretaries,

960
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,720
因为她们听命行事
'cause they do what they're told,

961
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,460
这就是她们悲惨又下流的原因
and that's why they're miserable and nasty.

962
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,330
但是你，你的人生一定会很精彩
But you, you got a big life ahead of you, I'm sure.

963
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:29,690
好吧，我不是真正的秘书
Okay. I'm not a real secretary.

964

对，你不是
No, you're not.

－因为你很聪明　－嗯
- 'Cause you're smart. - Mm.

966
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,650
你很有好奇心，是吗？
And you're curious, aren't you?

967
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,260
我的学习成绩一直不太好
Mm, I never really did very good in school,

968
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,180
所以我觉得我只是个普通人
so I'm just kind of average, I think.

969
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,920
别这么说，艾琳
Oh, don't say that, Eileen.

970
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,750
－千万别这么说，你...？
- Never say that. Do you...?

971
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,750
你真以为自己是个正常人？
You really think you're a normal person?

对不起
Sorry.

994
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,040
你有什么好对不起的？
What do you have to be sorry for?

995
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,040
继续，吃吧，吃吧
Go on. Go on. Eat. Eat. Yeah.

996
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,520
也吃点泡菜吧
Have a pickle, too.

997
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,440
为什么我们需要一把奶酪刀
Why do we need a little, uh, cheese knife

998
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,960
让我们的手保持干净？
To keep our hands clean?

999
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,790
不，这太荒谬了
No. It's all ridiculous.

1000
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,490
一切都是
Everything is.

1001
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:42,840
所有这些愚蠢的传统
All these stupid traditions,

1002
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,400
就像圣诞节的典狱长和他的监狱
like the-the warden and his prison at Christmas.

1003
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:47,930
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1004
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,730
我试着解释需要如何改变
I've tried explaining how things need to change,

1005
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,970
但他关心的
but all he cares about

1006
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,590
只是男孩们是不是会想起我
is whether or not the boys are gonna think about me

1007
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,850
当他们晚上在牢房里自慰的时候
while they molest themselves in their cells at night.

1008
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,630
上帝保佑
God forbid.

1009
01:04:58,990 --> 01:04:59,980
摩尔黑德有严格的
There's a strict

1010
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,940
禁止手淫的政策
no masturbation policy at Moorehead.

1011
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,680
在监狱里爽一把是违法的
It's illegal to get off in prison.

1012
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:06,950
你知道的，对吧？
You know that, right?

1013
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:08,950
好像这就是文明的堕落
As if that's the downfall of civilization,

1014
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,820
人们高潮了
people having orgasms.

1015
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,080
你不能指望男人来解决任何问题
You can't count on men to fix anything.

1016
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,480
人们为自己的欲望感到羞耻
People are so ashamed of their desires,

1017
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,190
尤其是男人
especially men.

1018
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,040
艾琳...
Eileen...

1019
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,790
你现在可能已经知道了
as you can probably tell by now,

1020
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,970
我的生活方式与大多数人有些不同
I live a little differently than most people.

1021
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,980
不，你的房子很好
No, your house i-is nice.

1022
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,150
－不，很舒适
- No. - It's cozy.

1023
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:40,590
我不是说房子，我是说...
I don't mean the house. I mean...

1024
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:43,750
我有自己的想法
I have my own ideas.

1025
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,600
也许你我都有这样的想法
Maybe you and I share some of those ideas.

1026
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:52,040
我们分享什么样的想法？
What kind of ideas do we share?

1027
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,360
我能向你倾诉吗？
May I confide in you?

1028
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,050
当然
Of course.

1029
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,660
是关于李·波尔克的
It's about Lee Polk.

1030
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,070
－是这样吗？－是的
- It is? - Yes.

1031
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,620
告诉我，亲爱的...
Tell me, honey...

1032
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,250
是什么让一个人想要杀死自己的父亲？
what would make a person want to kill their father?

1033
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,700
每个人都想杀死自己的父亲
Everybody wants to kill their father.

1034
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,800
不，他们没有，谁告诉你的？
No, they don't. Who told you that?

1035
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,610
真的，好好想想吧，艾琳
Really, think about it, Eileen.

1036
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,900
因为李偷偷溜进了父母的卧室
Because Lee snuck into his parents' bedroom

1037
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,860
在半夜...
in the middle of the night...

1038
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,950
砍断了他父亲的喉咙
hacked through his father's throat

1039
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:34,510
用一把旧菜刀
with an old kitchen knife,

1040
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,340
并多次刺中他的胸部
and stabbed him in the chest repeatedly.

1041
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,800
他的母亲声称，她以为有人闯入
His mother claimed she thought there'd been a break-in.

1042
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,300
你是怎么睡得着的？
How do you sleep through something like that?

1043
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,480
我不知道
I don't know.

1044
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,740
你不可能知道，所以我才叫她来
You don't. That's why I called her in.

1045
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,270
我是说，你当时在场
I mean, you were there.

1046
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,830
这个可怜的孩子几乎不敢看她，所以...
The poor boy could barely look at her, so...

1047
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:52,490
所以事后，我就直截了当地问他
so afterwards, I just asked him point-blank.

1048
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:53,790
我说...
I said...

1049
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,450
我说：“你父亲对你做了什么？”
I said, "What'd your father do to you?"

1050
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,820
“是什么让你想这样对待你父亲的尸体？”
"What made you want to do that to your father's body?"

1051
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,510
他在短短几分钟内就全说了出来
And he spilled it all in a matter of minutes.

1052
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,290
以前从来没有人问过他
Nobody had ever bothered to ask him before.

1053
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,780
没有人想过要问
No one had thought to ask.

1054
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,170
你不想知道吗？
Wouldn't you want to know?

1055
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,730
你难道不好奇吗？
Wouldn't you be curious?

1056
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:18,730
是的
Yes.

1057
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,310
你想知道吗？
Do you want to know?

1058
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,250
是的
Yes.

1059
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:33,790
艾琳，你不能告诉任何人，你明白吗？
Eileen, you can never tell anyone. Do you understand?

1060
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,290
你明白...答应我
You understa... Promise me.

1061
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:36,650
我保证
Promise.

1062
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:42,080
♪ 爱情怎么了...
♪ What happened to the love...

1063
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,670
你需要知道的第一件事
The first thing you need to know,

1064
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,110
这不是我家
this isn't my house.

1065
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:47,370
这是波尔克家
This is the Polk house.

1066
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,540
我把波克夫人绑在地下室了
I have Mrs. Polk tied up downstairs.

1067
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,320
艾琳，艾琳
Eileen. Eileen.

1068
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,470
艾琳
Eileen.

1069
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,870
艾琳，请稍候
Eileen, please wait.

1070
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,130
艾琳，求你了
Eileen, please.

1071
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,910
我以为我一个人就能搞定，艾琳
I thought I could do this alone, Eileen.

1072
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:13,090
－请别走，艾琳
- Please don't go. Eileen!

1073
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,130
求你了，别走，求你了
Please, don't go. Please.

1074
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:18,010
我以为你邀请我来，是因为你喜欢我
I thought you invited me over here 'cause you liked me.

1075
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,850
哦,，我喜欢你
Oh, I do.

1076
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,620
我喜欢你，对不起，对不起，求你了，艾琳
I do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, Eileen.

1077
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,230
求你了，艾琳，给我点时间
Just pl-please, Eileen. Just give me a moment.

1078
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,710
请听我解释
Please just let me explain.

1079
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,280
我需要...
I need...

1080
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,860
我需要一个朋友
I need a friend.

1081
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,550
昨天下午我来这里
I came here yesterday afternoon

1082
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,220
找波尔克夫人谈谈
to talk to Mrs. Polk.

1083
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,680
我说我看得出她很难过
I said I could see that she was upset

1084
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,160
在我们与李见面之后
after our meeting with Lee,

1085
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,160
她有什么想聊聊的吗？
was there anything she wanted to discuss.

1086
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,430
她说:“没什么”,，于是我...
She said, "Nothing", so I...

1087
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,080
我逼问她
I pressed her.

1088
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:54,170
我把李告诉我的话告诉了她
I told her what Lee had told me.

1089
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,260
她朝我吐口水，说我是变态
She spat at me, called me the pervert,

1090
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,180
然后称她的丈夫为圣人
then called her husband a saint,

1091
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:03,750
我留下了名片，让她考虑一下
and I left my card, told her to think about it.

1092
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,450
我知道她不会打电话来，然后我就走了
I knew she wouldn't call. Then I left.

1093
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,750
我昨晚一晚上没睡着
Now, I couldn't sleep last night.

1094
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,150
因为我...
'Cause I...

1095
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,800
我一直在想李告诉我的话
I couldn't stop thinking about what Lee had told me,

1096
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,330
他父亲的所作所为
what his father had done,

1097
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:21,200
以及他的母亲是如何看着这一切发生的
and how his mother had let it happen.

1098
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,030
我甚至都不记得开车过来的路了，我太生气了
I don't even remember the drive over here, I was so angry.

1099
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,770
突然，我从她身边挤了过去
Suddenly I was pushing past her,

1100
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,290
说：“你怎么能这样做？”
saying, "How could you do it?"

1101
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,210
“你怎么能对这种虐待充耳不闻？”
"How could you be complicit in such torture?"

1102
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:32,080
她大声叫骂
And she snapped.

1103
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,470
她攻击我，看到了吗？
She attacked me. See?

1104
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,170
看到了吗？
See?

1105
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,780
于是我开始自我防卫
So I defended myself.

1106
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,960
我们打了一架，我...我不知道发生了什么
We fought, and I... I don't know what happened,

1107
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,350
但不知怎的，我们从楼梯上摔到了地下室
but somehow we fell down the stairs to the basement.

1108
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,920
我以为她会杀了我
I-I thought she was gonna kill me,

1109
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,180
于是我用椅子砸她，把她绑起来
so I hit her with a chair and tied her up.

1110
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,710
我试着跟她理性地谈一谈
I tried to talk to her rationally,

1111
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:54,360
解释说我是来帮助李的
to explain that I was here to help Lee,

1112
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,850
如果她愿意，我也可以帮助她
that-that I could help her, too, if she'd let me,

1113
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:00,200
但是...但是她只是不停地尖叫
but... but she just kept screaming

1114
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,460
说我绑架了她，她丈夫是警察
that-that I'd kidnapped her and her husband was a cop

1115
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,030
我要去坐牢
and I was gonna go to jail.

1116
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:09,120
于是我在厕所里找到了一些可待因
So I found some codeine in a bathroom,

1117
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,770
并让她安静下来
and got her to be quiet.

1118
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,690
然后我给你打了电话
Then I called you.

1119
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,600
因为，如你所见，我正在紧要关头
Because, as you can see, I'm in a bit of a pinch.

1120
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,800
我能做些什么？
What can I do?

1121
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:22,260
我需要波尔克夫人坦白
I need Mrs. Polk to confess,

1122
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,530
我需要一个证人，两个对一个
and I need a witness, two against one.

1123
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,380
你明白吗？
You understand?

1124
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,490
哦，我不能进监狱
Oh, I can't go to jail.

1125
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,190
好的
Okay.

1126
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,550
好的
Okay.

1127
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,700
在这里等着
Wait here.

1128
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,650
艾琳，等等...
Eileen. Wait...

1129
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,490
太不可思议了
It's incredible.

1130
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:35,140
为什么会有这个？
Why do you have that?

1131
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,420
你为什么把它带到这里来？
Why did you bring that around here?

1132
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:37,800
我爸爸病了
My dad's sick.

1133
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,530
拿起来，让我看看你要怎么用
Pick it up, and show me how you're gonna hold it.

1134
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,450
很好，艾琳
That's very good, Eileen.

1135
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,010
好的
All right.

1136
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,630
冷静一点
Be cool.

1137
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,310
告诉我们真相吧，波尔克夫人
Just tell us the truth, Mrs. Polk,

1138
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,780
我们就放你走
and we'll let you go free.

1139
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:51,630
家庭可以疗愈
Families can heal.

1140
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:53,800
你并没有迷失人性，没有人是
You're not a lost cause. No one is.

1141
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,150
这并不容易
It can't have been easy,

1142
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:57,760
嫁给这样一个男人
being married to a man like that.

1143
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,160
很明显，你的日子也不好过
You're obviously having a hard time.

1144
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:05,250
你为什么不告诉我们这房子里发生了什么？
Why don't you tell us what happened in this house,

1145
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,730
你为什么要帮你丈夫做这些事？
why you helped your husband do what he did?

1146
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:11,600
然后我们就扯平了
And then we'll be even,

1147
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,770
我们都可以走出这里，和...
and we can all walk out of here, and...

1148
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:19,070
我们就能想办法帮助李了
we can figure out how to help Lee.

1149
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,770
他妈的给我松绑，给我松绑
Fucking untie me! Untie me!

1150
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,310
让我出去
Let me out of here!

1151
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,110
你这个疯婆子，滚出我的房子
You crazy bitch, get out of my house!

1152
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,590
你有大麻烦了，你以为你会
You're in big trouble, you think you're gonna

1153
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,180
－能逃过这一劫　－艾琳
- get away with this! - Eileen.

1154
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,090
你会在监狱里蹲很长时间
You're going to jail for a long time.

1155
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,180
她在这里干什么？
What the hell is she doing here?!

1156
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,090
你在这里做什么？
What are you doing here?

1157
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:46,810
我真的觉得你需要告诉我们真相
I really think you need to tell us the truth.

1158
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,600
你到底在说什么？
What the hell are you talking about?!

1159
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,820
－如果你不...
- If you don't...

1160
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,100
我们可以把你绑在这里
we could leave you down here tied up,

1161
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,310
没人能找到你
no one to find you.

1162
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:54,650
人体撑不了多久的
The human body can't live very long

1163
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:56,340
没有食物和水
without food and water.

1164
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,610
迟早，你会需要拉屎
Sooner or later, you're gonna need to take a shit.

1165
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:01,410
我想你就只能拉在身上了
I guess you're just gonna have to shit yourself.

1166
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,180
还有小便
And piss.

1167
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,630
感觉不会很好
It's not gonna feel very good.

1168
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:08,210
我不怕你
I'm not scared of you.

1169
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,900
我认识你
I know you.

1170
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,360
我知道你爸爸是谁
I know who your dad is.

1171
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,580
如果你认识我爸爸，你应该感到害怕
If you know my dad, then you oughta be scared.

1172
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:16,840
是吗？害怕一个拈花惹草的酒鬼
Yeah? Scared of a womanizing, drunk piece of shit

1173
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,020
大家都知道的一个疯子？
who everybody knows is batshit crazy?

1174
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,540
你以为他自己没有问题吗？
You think he didn't have problems of his own?

1175
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:22,440
你以为他没有自己的秘密吗？
You think he didn't have secrets of his own, huh?

1176
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:24,210
你以为你妈妈不知道吗？
You think your mom didn't know about 'em?

1177
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,160
认为没有...
Think it didn't...

1178
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,850
我要杀了你
I am going to fucking kill you

1179
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:31,830
如果你现在不开始交代的话
if you don't start talking right now!

1180
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,990
求求你
Please!

1181
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,170
求求你，别杀我
Please, don't kill me.

1182
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:40,760
只要你开口，我就不会杀你
I won't have to kill you if you talk.

1183
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,500
我做不到
I can't.

1184
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,910
不要，求你了
No, please.

1185
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,980
她不会帮你的，说吧
She's not gonna help you. Talk.

1186
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,060
除非你坦白，否则我帮不了你
I can't help you unless you confess.

1187
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:27,860
好吧
All right.

1188
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:32,850
你赢了
You win.

1189
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,980
等你结了婚
When you get married

1190
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,300
有了孩子...
and you have children...

1191
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:55,620
结婚时要宣誓
You take an oath when you get married

1192
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,450
尊敬并服从你的丈夫
to honor and obey your husband.

1193
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,480
你们不会明白的
You wouldn't understand that.

1194
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:04,740
起初，我...
At first, I...

1195
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,000
一开始，我以为米奇
At first, I just, I thought Mitch

1196
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,830
只是在他睡觉的时候看看他
was just checking on him in his sleep,

1197
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,670
你知道，就像所有父亲一样
you know, like any father would,

1198
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,040
他只是想确定
like he, he just wanted to be sure

1199
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,240
他的儿子安然无恙地躺在床上
his son was safe and sound in bed.

1200
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:19,840
有时我...
Sometimes I'd...

1201
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,620
感觉到他下了床
feel him getting out of bed,

1202
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,180
有时他回来时，我就能感觉到
and sometimes I'd just feel him when he'd come back.

1203
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,070
他...
And he'd...

1204
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:33,020
吻我或...
kiss me or...

1205
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,740
抱着我...
hold me and...

1206
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,120
你知道吗？
You know?

1207
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,770
我们并没有真正在一起
And we hadn't really been together

1208
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,620
自从李出生以后
since Lee'd been born.

1209
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,240
但后来我...
But then I...

1210
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,790
我下面开始感染
I started getting these infections down there.

1211
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,350
我想这是我的错
I figured it was my fault.

1212
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,440
然后我在想，是不是米奇
And then I wondered if Mitch

1213
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,710
他带了些东西回来，你知道吗？
had brought something home with him, you know?

1214
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,010
然后有一次
Then one time...

1215
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,780
我半夜起来
I got up in the middle of the night.

1216
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:21,550
我不记得为什么了
I don't remember why.

1217
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,590
一杯水？我不知道
Glass of water? I don't know.

1218
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:31,820
我想，我想这也许是个梦
I thought-I thought maybe it was a dream.

1219
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,670
我
I...

1220
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,670
我走了进去
I went-I went and looked in.

1221
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,570
我并没有马上意识到这一点
It didn't dawn on me right away.

1222
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:48,950
我发誓
You know, I-I swear to you. I...

1223
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,350
我的意思是...
I mean...

1224
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,410
你不会指望你丈夫
You don't expect your husband's

1225
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,390
会干出那种事来，你知道吗？
gonna do something like that, you know?

1226
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,750
我是说，反正没人会相信
I mean, nobody would believe it, anyway.

1227
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,070
然后我...，然后...
And then I... and then...

1228
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,380
然后我想...
And then I figured...

1229
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,380
然后我想，如果李是干净的...
And then I figured, if Lee was clean...

1230
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:22,020
如果他是干净的
If he was clean,

1231
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,900
睡前灌肠和洗澡...
an enema and a bath before bed...

1232
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,630
那么对我们大家都好
then it would be better for all of us.

1233
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,340
的确如此
And it was.

1234
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,020
我知道我在做什么，这不是...
I knew what I was doing, it wasn't...

1235
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:40,570
这不太对
it wasn't quite right.

1236
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,990
我知道，我知道
I did know that. I did.

1237
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:46,590
但你会告诉谁呢？你知道吗？
But who do you tell? You know?

1238
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,090
我能告诉谁呢？
Who could I tell?

1239
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,610
我的意思是，你要尽力而为
I mean, you do the best you can.

1240
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,980
你知道生了孩子之后会发生什么吗？
You know what happens when you have children?

1241
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:04,260
你丈夫看你的眼神再也不一样了
Your husband never looks at you the same.

1242
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:10,320
但在他和李上床之后
But after he went to bed with Lee,

1243
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,610
他会来找我
he'd come to me.

1244
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:19,360
就像卸下了一个沉重的包袱
It was like a big burden had been lifted.

1245
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,500
他，他很放松
He was, he was relaxed.

1246
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:27,030
他抱着我的感觉真好
It felt good, how he'd hold me.

1247
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,890
那会他爱我
He loved me then.

1248
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:34,860
他会轻声地吻我
He would whisper and kiss me.

1249
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:39,620
这就是以前的样子...
It was the way it had been before...

1250
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:44,040
那时我们年轻，快乐，相爱
when we were young and happy and in love.

1251
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,400
感觉很好
It felt good.

1252
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,450
这有什么不对吗...
Is that so wrong...

1253
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,100
想拥有这种感觉？
to want to feel like that?

1254
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,590
你不会明白的
You wouldn't understand.

1255
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,370
你还年轻，还没有心碎过
You're young, you haven't had your heart broken.

1256
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:16,200
我在流血，我在流血
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding!

1257
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,860
救救我，救救我
Help me! Help me!

1258
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,680
求你了，求...救救我
Please! Plea... Help me!

1259
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,420
－我在流血　－嘘
- I'm bleeding! - Shh! Shh!

1260
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:23,120
－救救我，你会后悔的　－艾琳，帮我
- Help me! You'll be sorry! - Eileen, help me!

1261
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,580
我会告诉所有人你做了什么
I'll tell everyone what you've done!

1262
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,610
－艾琳　－医生
- Eileen! - A doctor!

1263
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:28,910
叫个医生
Get a doctor!

1264
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,090
－救我出去　－艾琳，帮帮我
- Get me out of here! - Eileen, help me!

1265
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,810
救救我
Help me!

1266
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,880
不要
No! No!

1267
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:46,450
不
No.

1268
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:48,150
不要
No! No!

1269
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,700
不要
No! No!

1270
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,630
好了，好了
Okay. Okay.

1271
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,880
你为什么开枪打她？
Why did you shoot her?

1272
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:55,430
我太难受了
I was upset.

1273
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,950
我们现在该怎么办？
What do we do now?

1274
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:14,060
我们带她去我家
We take her to my house.

1275
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,280
我爸爸总是把枪拿出来晃
My dad's always whipping his gun out.

1276
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,070
人人皆知
Everyone knows it.

1277
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:28,470
我们可以伪装成他是在喝多后打死她的
We can make it look like he shot her in a blackout.

1278
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:34,250
他只是个酒鬼，对吧？
He's just a drunk piece of shit, right?

1279
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,950
无论如何他都会死，或者疯掉
He's gonna die anyway or go crazy.

1280
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:39,040
医生是这么说的
The doctor said so.

1281
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,170
我们带她一起走吧
So let's take her together and leave.

1282
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:44,920
然后我们就可以去纽约过年了...
Then we could go to New York for the New Year...

1283
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,400
只有我们两个人
just the two of us.

1284
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,820
我爱你
I love you.

1285
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:57,690
没关系
It's okay.

1286
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:01,500
来吧
Come on.

1287
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,890
好吧
All right.

1288
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,100
你先去你父亲家
You go ahead to your father's house.

1289
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,340
在那儿等我
Wait for me there.

1290
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,780
－好　－我去里面收拾一下
- Yeah. - I'll clean up inside.

1291
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,040
我们不能留下任何证据
We can't leave any evidence behind.

1292
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,520
－我会等你的　－我会很快的
- I'll be waiting. - I'll be quick.

1293
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,890
艾琳
Eileen.

1294
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:26,180
艾琳
Eileen.

1295
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:31,330
继续睡吧，爸爸
Go back to sleep, Dad.

1296
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,050
你要去哪儿？
Where you going?

1297
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:09,550
我可能要上路了
I might just get on the road.

1298
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,290
那好吧
All right, then.

1299
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,300
晚安
Good night.

1300
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
