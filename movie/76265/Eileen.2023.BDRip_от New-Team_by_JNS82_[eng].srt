Eileen.

37
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,564
Eileen!

38
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,442
I need form I-37.

39
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:35,818
- Transfer form?
- No.

40
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,070
Intake. I-37.

41
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,072
Aren't you listening?

42
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,699
She is useless.

43
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,743
Dr. Frye
still needs to sign it.

44
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,870
He's probably asleep
in his office.

45
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,705
Oh, yeah.

46
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,540
Maybe you could go
wake up Dr. Frye.

47
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,209
Blow softly in his ear.

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,919
He loves that.

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,337
Leave Eileen alone.

50
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,005
She's tired.

51
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,090
Oh, is that what it is?

52
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,218
I thought maybe it was
that time of the month.

53
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,136
At least I have
a time of the month.

54
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,906
Oh, yeah.
You know something, honey?

55
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,824
It won't last forever.
You'll be old like us soon.

56
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,661
Mrs. Nelson
to the visiting area, please.

57
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,896
Mrs. Nelson
to the visiting area.

58
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:38,297
I'm not gonna fight
with anybody. I told you.

59
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,549
How's Mickey doing?

60
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,967
I'm trying to be good.

61
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,319
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

62
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,636
Well, it's not my fault...

63
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,407
Maybe I'll see you next time.

64
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,954
As much as we're
gonna miss the old dog,

65
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,664
I hope you'll all be welcoming

66
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,708
to Dr. Frye's replacement
on Monday.

67
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,585
A fine, fine young doctor.

68
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:00,546
Yes, well, let's hope
the boys take her seriously.

69
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:01,797
I'll take her.

70
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,967
Seriously.

71
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,386
I think you will be
taking your insulin

72
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,013
and your retirement package.

73
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,389
That'll be enough for you.

74
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,849
That's right.

75
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:14,727
I'll really miss
all the fun around here.

76
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,437
Let's hear it for Dr. Frye.

77
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,439
Cheers!

78
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,968
I see a lot of Anne these days.

79
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,054
Yeah, a lot
of broken hearts out there.

80
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,889
Hey, hon.

81
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,349
Hey.

82
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,517
How's your dad?

83
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,728
Good.

84
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,731
You know what? Let me get that.

85
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:02,775
Thanks.

86
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,625
...want you to go inside
and shut the fuck up!

87
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,335
You shut... you shut up!

88
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,938
- Fuck off! Shut up!
- You shut up!

89
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,606
- Fucking booze bag!
- Oh, I'll do...

90
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,566
- I'm gonna have a drink.
- You all right there, chief?

91
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,217
You can fuck right off.

92
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,278
Goddamn Lutherans next door
are the problem, not me.

93
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,738
Nobody's complaining.
We just want to make sure

94
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,764
you're getting home
safe and sound.

95
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,057
Nobody's complaining?

96
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,475
- Dad.
- Safe and sound?

97
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,185
- Why wouldn't I be safe
and sound? -Dad.

98
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,496
I keep the whole fucking
neighborhood safe and sound.

99
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,730
- What do you know?
- Dad.

100
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,148
E-Eileen, go inside.

101
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,150
- Okay. Dad, look to me.
- Go inside.

102
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,443
Come on. Please. Please.

103
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,236
Hey! You're causing a scene.

104
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,905
Trust me, Eileen.
Nobody wants nothing with you.

105
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,323
- Okay.
- Mwah!

106
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,950
- Come on. Go inside.
- Mwah!

107
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,702
Goddamn Lutherans right there.

108
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,704
Your mother always hated
those people.

109
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:59,582
- Gosh, let's go inside.
- They can fuck off. Sure.

110
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,333
You can't go around
policing people, Dad.

111
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,961
Who says?
You know who that guy was?

112
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,439
We got it all
under control, chief.

113
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:06,964
You can take it easy. Please.

114
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:09,133
Take it easy?
Y-You fuckin' take it easy.

115
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:10,444
You're not a cop anymore.

116
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,802
Yeah, sure.

117
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,345
I didn't want to retire.
They made me,

118
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,930
'cause I was
too goddamn good at it.

119
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,074
Look, I gotta get
back to the station.

120
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,183
Pour me a drink. Good.

121
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,326
Get back to the station, Buck.

122
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,852
Give me my drink.

123
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,687
Just give us a call
if you need anything.

124
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,105
Merry Christmas.

125
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,490
Hey, come here.
What's that smell?

126
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,699
Did you step in something?

127
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,035
No. Why? What do you smell?

128
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,119
I don't know. Roadkill.

129
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,581
Maybe you should
keep your distance.

130
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,293
Yeah, I'll keep my distance.

131
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,462
The fuck you doing?
Put my fucking shoes back on.

132
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,506
But maybe
you should be nicer to me.

133
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,549
No one else is gonna
put up with your shit.

134
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,384
Go then, 'cause I got Joanie.

135
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,304
She wouldn't keep a place
looking like this.

136
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,306
She's a real woman, your sister.

137
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,225
And she smells like a woman.

138
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,935
She knows how to keep a house!

139
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,355
And she doesn't live here,
and she's married!

140
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,982
Yeah, 'cause she's
not a hanger-on.

141
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,901
And she doesn't want
to talk to you!

142
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:13,197
Yeah, sure, 'cause she's
made a life of her own.

143
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,907
She's made something of herself.

144
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,453
Whatever, Dad.

145
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,705
Get a life, Eileen. Get a clue.

146
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,512
Shit.

147
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,607
Fuck it.

148
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,558
All right, listen up!

149
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,479
As you know, in the new year,

150
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,773
we will be up for state review.

151
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,527
So we're gonna be
tightening our procedures

152
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:21,533
and implementing new strategies
based on some big, new ideas.

153
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:26,038
And on that note,
this new young lady to my left,

154
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,624
Dr. Miss Rebecca St. John,

155
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,543
is our new prison psychologist.

156
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:35,130
She's just finished
her doctorate at Radcliffe.

157
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,590
Harvard.

158
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,592
Ah. Harvard.

159
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,094
We may not be Harvard people,

160
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,263
but I think
we can keep up with her,

161
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,557
and hopefully she can
keep up with us

162
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,018
as we keep up with them.

163
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,938
She may be easy on the eyes,
but I assure you,

164
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,773
she is very smart.

165
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:56,652
Ladies, I hope you
show Miss St. John around...

166
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,377
Say, how much for a glazed?

167
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,838
They're free.

168
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,257
I'm kidding.

169
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,302
I'm Rebecca.

170
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,886
I know.

171
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,598
Say, where can a girl
get freshened up around here?

172
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,142
I can show you.

173
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,269
Sure. Appreciate it.

174
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,603
Can I take your jacket?

175
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,522
Aren't you sweet? Thanks.

176
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,899
This way.

177
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,902
I don't think
I caught your name.

178
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,154
Eileen.

179
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,239
- Morning.
- Morning.

180
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,532
Where you from?

181
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:44,908
Huh?

182
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,368
Oh, I'm from New York
originally.

183
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,911
Manhattan.

184
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,790
Couldn't stand Cambridge.
Way too uptight.

185
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,518
Well, there were a couple
of interesting people,

186
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,253
but, no, I needed a break.

187
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,796
Get some fresh air.

188
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,506
And I love the beach.

189
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,469
All right.

190
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,679
32...

191
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,100
24...

192
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,478
34.

193
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,979
Practically my measurements.

194
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,523
You know, some women
think their figures

195
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,609
are the only thing that matters.

196
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,694
Honestly, I think
that's kind of pathetic.

197
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,238
I completely agree.

198
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,449
My sister's like that,
and she's not very smart.

199
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,034
Mm, good. Then you and I

200
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,953
have better things to discuss
than our figures.

201
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,831
Although that isn't
the popular opinion,

202
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,166
wouldn't you say?

203
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,709
I don't care what's popular.

204
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,962
Well, look at you.

205
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,631
A regular Katharine Hepburn.

206
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,758
Rare to meet a young woman
with so much gumption.

207
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,259
I'm like that, too.

208
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,179
I don't give a rat's ass
what people think.

209
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,448
They're probably scared of you.

210
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,099
Moi?

211
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,310
All right. See you around.

212
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,607
Every year,

213
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,442
we hold this special assembly

214
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,903
to celebrate the birth
of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

215
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,155
And every year,
one of you sick bastards

216
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,865
ruins it for the rest of us.

217
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:11,703
Well, you've disrespected
Christmas for the last time

218
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,831
because this year,
you're gonna sit on your hands,

219
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,833
you're gonna zip your lips.

220
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,252
If I see any of you biting,
kicking, screaming, pushing,

221
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,629
pulling hair, laughing, moaning,

222
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,590
or I hear one wayward comment,

223
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,759
you're going
straight to the cave.

224
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,011
And now, without further ado,

225
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,682
it is my honor to thank
the people from Mount Olive

226
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,493
who helped me direct
the pageant again this year...

227
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,328
- Yay, Mount Olive.
- and present to you

228
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,105
"Christmas in Prison."

229
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,078
I'm gonna kill someone
on Christmas.

230
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,621
Shut up!

231
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,882
Oh, what am I to do?

232
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,925
Sentenced for three years
to sit indoors

233
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,136
among boys of my same creed,
plain bad.

234
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,138
So much time to plot

235
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,599
what evil-doings I'll undertake
as soon as I get out.

236
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,392
You want some cake, you fatty?!

237
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,370
In the meantime,
I suppose I could read a book.

238
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,354
You can't read, motherfucker!

239
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,487
Fucking Shakespeare up here.

240
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,329
I'm scrappy right now.

241
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,247
Book of truth!

242
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,005
Oh, look at McAllister.

243
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,274
Fucking McAllister.

244
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,966
Hey, nice rack!

245
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,637
Well, I'm-I'm pretty tired.

246
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,639
Can we rest in that barn
over there?

247
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,158
Better than paying for a motel.

248
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,975
You're the best, Joseph.

249
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,078
Thank you for taking us here
to be counted in the census.

250
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,437
Fuck this shit!

251
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,939
- Guard!
- Wait.

252
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,660
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- Hey, grab him.

253
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,490
Move back!

254
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,925
All you guys sit down!

255
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,510
Sit the fuck down!

256
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,805
Hey, Bob.

257
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,889
Hey, hon.

258
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,307
This and a pack of Luckies.

259
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,310
Oh! It's a lucky day, huh?

260
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,937
Yeah, the luckiest.

261
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,481
Yup. Cigarettes are great.

262
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,528
Don't light yourself on fire.

263
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,540
You're in a good mood,
what's wrong with you?

264
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,542
Nothing's wrong, Dad.

265
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,467
You look funny with that thing
in your mouth.

266
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,430
How was your day, Dad?

267
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,848
How was my day?

268
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,142
I don't know.

269
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,977
It was a day, just another day.

270
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,520
What's the point?

271
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,441
My day was a doozy.

272
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,651
Oh, yeah?

273
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,779
A big fight broke out
at the Christmas pageant.

274
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,574
Kid got his collarbone broken,

275
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,577
and I had to do all
this paperwork for the warden.

276
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,912
Don't ash on the floor,
it's tacky.

277
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,666
Anyway...

278
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,849
It was one of those days
you never forget.

279
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,796
Oh, yeah?
Days I'll never forget.

280
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,966
Let me see.

281
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,260
December 16, 1944,

282
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,680
first time I ever held
a dead man's head in my lap.

283
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,058
What a waste.

284
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,435
20 degrees outside and snowing.

285
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,813
Just like it is here.

286
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,399
Don't know why I ever
came back to this place.

287
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,653
Maybe because you had a wife
and two kids.

288
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,237
Maybe.

289
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,239
I love the beach.

290
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,492
Oh, yeah? Good for you.

291
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,619
War kind of ruined beaches
for me.

292
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,954
So what else?

293
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,624
How's that Polk kid?
He talked yet?

294
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,667
Huh?

295
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,043
Polk.

296
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,753
The kid who stabbed
his father...

297
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,715
who was a good cop,
more or less.

298
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,887
What kind of kid thinks of
killing his father like that?

299
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,265
Stab him in his sleep...

300
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,975
in front of his mother.

301
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,896
Then he just sits down.

302
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,940
Never denies it.

303
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,067
Never says a word
the whole trial.

304
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,029
Psychopathic.

305
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,217
Course I wouldn't
have to worry about you

306
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,121
doing something like that,
now, would I?

307
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,248
'Cause you're a girl.

308
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,250
Can't imagine you with a knife.

309
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,461
Can you imagine me with a gun?

310
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,007
Yeah, I can see it.

311
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,720
One day...

312
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,098
when you've had enough
and you feel like, uh...

313
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,766
ducking out.

314
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,311
Maybe when I'm dead and gone

315
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,397
and you got nobody
and you never will.

316
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,275
I could imagine that.

317
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,738
But you wouldn't, would you?

318
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,490
'Cause you're too good.

319
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,372
Say, give me
one of those cigarettes.

320
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,416
What have you got, Old Gold?

321
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,834
No.

322
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,252
I like Old Gold.

323
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,090
I know.

324
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,278
Oopsie.

325
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,781
Do you need any help?

326
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:03,824
Uh, no, I'm okay.

327
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,283
Just butterfingers.

328
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,369
You should see me.

329
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,912
I'm a total klutz.

330
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,086
Oh, right.

331
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,421
Lee Polk.

332
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,841
That's not something
you see every day.

333
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,012
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

334
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,016
Bedtime reading?

335
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,936
I was just doing some filing.

336
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,858
That's some show yesterday.

337
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,735
They do it every year.

338
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:44,197
I'd call that
cruel and unusual punishment.

339
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,123
Sorry. I don't usually smoke.

340
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,749
It's a nasty habit.

341
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,334
That's why I like it.

342
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,878
Not very becoming
of a lady, though.

343
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,005
Turns your teeth yellow.

344
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,715
See?

345
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,800
That's cigarettes and coffee.

346
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,302
And red wine.

347
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,096
No, your teeth are perfect.

348
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,310
I don't drink coffee,

349
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,562
so my teeth
should be fine, but...

350
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,106
they're all rotted

351
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,400
due to my extreme propensity
for sweets.

352
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,903
A propensity for sweets.

353
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,779
You don't get enough sweetness
in your life?

354
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,199
I just eat a lot of candy.

355
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,201
Mm. I wouldn't know it
to look at you.

356
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,703
You're so petite.

357
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,538
Being tall has its advantages,
of course,

358
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,541
but most men
are just too short for me.

359
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,045
Have you noticed,
or am I imagining things,

360
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,590
that men these days are
getting shorter and shorter,

361
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,967
balder, and fatter?

362
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,136
All the men around here
are little boys.

363
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,764
You're funny.

364
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,849
I meant outside this prison.

365
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:53,892
Although you're right.

366
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,227
The guards, the warden,

367
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,812
they're not much to look at.

368
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,898
You should have seen Dr. Frye.

369
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,651
He was really
pretty nasty looking.

370
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,402
That doesn't surprise me.

371
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,654
My office isn't very becoming,

372
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,489
and it all smells
of dirty leather.

373
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,258
I'm beginning to wonder
what went on in there.

374
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,576
Nothing good.

375
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,331
I mean, I never actually
been in that office.

376
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,125
Oh. Well, you should
come by sometime.

377
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,294
Although if the door's closed,

378
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,588
that means
I'm with one of the boys.

379
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,965
Okay.

380
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,509
Aren't you ever scared

381
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,761
being alone in there with them?

382
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,806
No.

383
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,599
Come by, and see me sometime,
all right?

384
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,369
Although, you know, if you
hear me screaming in there,

385
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,193
feel free to kick down the door
and rescue me.

386
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,479
Okay.

387
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,648
I'm just kidding, honey.

388
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,941
There's a buzzer.

389
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,540
I'm here to see Leonard Polk.

390
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,793
Anne Polk.

391
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,966
You're not on the schedule.

392
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,342
Are you a late addition?

393
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,391
I-I was called.

394
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,518
I don't know, I-I'm here now.

395
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,520
Well, you need
to fill out a form.

396
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,858
Aren't you Chief Dunlop's kid?

397
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,152
Yeah.

398
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,487
I thought so.

399
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,907
Mrs. Polk? I'm Dr. St. John.

400
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,034
We spoke on the phone.
Thank you so much for coming.

401
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,178
Oh, no need to bother with that.

402
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,162
We all know who you are.

403
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,544
Eileen, would you
help us with the door?

404
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,919
Thank you.

405
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,879
It's this way.

406
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,924
Take your coat?

407
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,343
Please.

408
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,678
Thank you, Eileen.

409
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,850
After you.

410
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,912
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,513
Huh?

412
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,348
You got something to say to me?

413
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:32,986
Let me out!

414
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,238
Let me out! Let me out!

415
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,824
Let me out!

416
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:43,121
Y-You do... y'all do
what you want with him.

417
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,331
Won't even talk
to his own mother?

418
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,333
He's always been a nasty boy.

419
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,128
A filthy, nasty boy!

420
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,130
I need to lock up.

421
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,885
Visitation hours were
actually over 20 minutes ago.

422
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,261
Oh, I-I understand.

423
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:02,473
Would you like to keep talking
in my office?

424
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,354
- Let's go.
- Turn around.

425
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:09,689
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.

426
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,232
- I need to cuff him.
- No.

427
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,156
Don't worry, Lee.
It's all right.

428
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,999
That won't be necessary.

429
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,085
Don't do that. She's a doctor.

430
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,337
I think she needs a doctor.

431
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,379
That kid killed a cop.

432
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,340
He killed his father.

433
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,591
There's a difference.

434
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,181
Oh, I'm so
sorry. Let me see who it is.

435
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,350
Oh, Eileen.

436
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,477
Um, can I help you?

437
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,439
You forgot your notebook.

438
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,107
Oh, thank you so much.

439
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,400
I actually need this.

440
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,319
Um, hope you didn't read it.

441
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,862
- No, of course not.
- Oh, no,

442
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,656
I'm just kidding.
It's just chicken scratch.

443
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:05,954
Wait. Eileen.

444
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,917
I don't mean to be forward,

445
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,086
and, um, you probably
have other plans already,

446
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,338
but, um, can I take you
to a drink tonight?

447
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,090
I don't know anyone
in this darn town,

448
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,151
and I'd love to treat you
to a cocktail if you're game.

449
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,802
- Okay.
- Okay?

450
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,238
I've twisted your arm?

451
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,556
So, uh, who makes
the best martini in town?

452
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,475
- Maybe O'Hara's?
- O'Hara's.

453
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,893
It's actually
the only bar in town.

454
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:30,144
No, O'Hara's is good.

455
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,605
See you at 7:00?

456
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,399
With bells on?

- Hi.
- Oh, Eileen.

481
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,562
Hi.

482
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:37,772
Please, please, please, sit.

483
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,649
Um, what are you having?

484
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,111
Uh, I'll have a beer, I guess.

485
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,654
A beer? Oh.

486
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:45,947
Hi, Eileen.

487
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,073
Good to see you, hon.

488
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,200
What's next, sweetheart?

489
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,619
Um, well... Oh, my stars.

490
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,329
You're absolutely frozen.

491
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,623
Um, one beer, please,
and maybe a little whiskey

492
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,000
to warm up my girl.
What say, huh?

493
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,754
My, you look very glamorous.

494
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:02,964
It's just an old dress.

495
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,090
May I?

496
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,850
How about you,
sweetheart? Another martini?

497
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,309
Love one. Thank you.

498
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,854
Maybe let's hold the olives
this time.

499
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,832
I thought I'd have
a hard time finding this place,

500
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,399
but here it is.

501
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,531
You feeling all right?

502
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,827
Yeah, I'm fine.

503
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,495
Uh, there's something wrong
with my car,

504
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:36,456
so I have to drive
with the windows down,

505
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,291
or else it fills with smoke.

506
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,643
Oh, you're kidding.

507
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,377
That sounds absolutely awful.

508
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,255
Can't you get your husband
to fix that for you?

509
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,382
Oh, no, I'm not married.

510
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,259
I've always been single.

511
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,886
And when I do have a guy around,

512
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,929
it's just for fun,
and it's brief.

513
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:55,266
No, I never stay anywhere
long with anything.

514
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,477
Sort of my modus vivendi

515
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:01,355
or my pathology, depending on
who I'm talking to.

516
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,319
How long have you
worked at Moorehead?

517
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,945
Three or four years.

518
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,824
Uh, it was only
supposed to be temporary,

519
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:16,037
while I moved back for a bit
while my mother was sick,

520
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,456
and then she died, so...

521
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,375
I've been at the prison,
and time's just flown by.

522
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,835
Oh, God.

523
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,087
Prison is no place
for time to fly by.

524
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,423
And your mother dying.

525
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,094
That's a lot for a young lady.

526
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:35,723
Ah. 24.

527
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,726
Then you must be eager
to get back out there. Are you?

528
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:44,899
You know, um,
I'm an orphan, too.

529
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,692
My uncle raised me out West.

530
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,362
Where the sun shines.

531
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,756
I don't understand
how you all do it here,

532
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,740
winter after winter.

533
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,243
It's positively creepy.
I don't know.

534
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,495
I'm in a sort of strange
love affair with New England.

535
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,664
I love it, but I also hate it.

536
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,501
Things feel very real here,
don't they?

537
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,712
Sort of there's no...

538
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:09,298
imagination.

539
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,968
There's no sentimentality
or fantasy.

540
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:15,221
There's... there's just
nowhere to hide.

541
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,394
Sorry.

542
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,312
I've had too much to drink.

543
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,523
I tend to talk when I've had
too much to drink.

544
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,941
It's all right.

545
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,335
Mm, it's better
than talking too little.

546
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:31,862
Did you see Lee Polk today?

547
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:35,575
Uh...

548
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,034
Did she say anything to you?

549
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,828
Mrs. Polk?

550
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,206
She was just upset.

551
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,667
Those mothers are always upset.

552
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,961
Mm-hmm.

553
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,338
Did she seem
like an angry woman to you?

554
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,883
I don't know. Uh...

555
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,385
everyone's kind of angry here.

556
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,845
- It's Massachusetts.
- Mm.

557
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,391
Well, I had this professor
at Harvard.

558
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,394
He was brilliant,
but very difficult.

559
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:07,648
Uh, he did this...
these experiments on prisoners

560
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,859
studying the effects
of psychedelics on recidivism.

561
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,128
Now, I don't agree
with his methods,

562
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,528
there is no magic pill,

563
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,948
but... but you can
set people free...

564
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:21,579
if you can get them to tell
the truth, to feel it.

565
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,205
That's what I want to do.

566
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,417
Secrets and lies.

567
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,544
I tell you, doll...

568
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,340
some families are so sick,
so twisted,

569
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,525
the only way out's
for someone to die.

570
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,551
Don't you think?

571
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,804
Hey! What'd you say
your name was?

572
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,848
Who, me?

573
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,850
Ah, yeah. W-We was just saying

574
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,352
that you look so familiar.

575
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,145
Are you in the movies
or something?

576
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,813
Hardly. I work
at the boys' prison.

577
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:48,981
- Ah.
- I'm Eileen,

578
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,125
and this is my friend, Rebecca.

579
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,692
She's a psychologist.

580
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:53,986
Don't be shy, Rebecca.

581
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,196
These boys won't bite.

582
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,741
Not unless you ask us to.

583
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,493
This is Jerry.
You can ignore him.

584
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,536
He's married.

585
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,038
What happened
to your teeth, Jerry?

586
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,873
You get into a fight
with your old lady?

587
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,851
That's it. His wife's
got a left like Joe Frazier.

588
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,169
Nah, nah.
He... he slipped on the ice.

589
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,712
I'm gonna grow
some new ones, though.

590
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,297
Mm-hmm.

591
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,882
Just need a few more of these.

592
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,926
Cheers to that.
To Jerry and his new teeth.

593
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,469

You remind me of a girl
in a Dutch painting.

639
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,312
You have a strange face.

640
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,356
It's plain, but...

641
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:19,984
fascinating.

642
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,986
It has a beautiful...

643
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,281
turbulence.

644
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,991
I love it.

645
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,664
I bet you have brilliant dreams.

646
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,084
I bet you dream of other worlds.

647
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:42,214
Maybe you'll dream of me
and my morning remorse,

648
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,425
which is certain.

649
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,719
I shouldn't drink,

650
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,013
but I do.

651
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,184
Thank you.

652
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:40,940
Hey, Sandy, can I get a martini
and some matches?

653
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,448
Better be careful, Eileen.

654
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,033
I don't want any trouble
with your dad.

655
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,370
My dad's not gonna cause
any trouble.

656
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:19,621
Dad. Dad.

657
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,415
Dad, can you let me in?

658
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,084
Shit.

659
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,608
Hey, Dad!

660
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,985
Can I have the keys?

661
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,071
Can I please have the keys?

662
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,656
No, you may not have the keys.

663
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,551
Not until you read that book
from cover to cover.

664
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,577
I want to hear every word.

665
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,543
Where'd you put the keys?

666
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,964
Make yourself comfortable,
Eileen.

667
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,842
You're not going anywhere
till you read the last word.

668
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:16,053
Dad, this is ridiculous.
I need to go to work.

669
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:18,347
Out all night.

670
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:19,807
Nearly crashed the car.

671
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,059
Sleeping in your own sick,

672
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:24,186
and now you're worried
about getting to work on time?

673
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:25,979
I can hardly look at you,
I'm so ashamed.

674
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,859
Oliver Twist would be grateful
for this home,

675
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:32,736
but you, Eileen,

676
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:34,279
you're trash, Eileen,
just trash.

677
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,698
All I did was go out
with a girl from work.

678
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,117
You went out
with a girl from work?

679
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,511
Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

680
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:41,203
Who is he? Huh?

681
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:43,372
Who is this boy?
I just want to know who he is

682
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,350
before you get knocked up
and sell your soul to Satan.

683
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:47,793
Can you just give me the keys?!

684
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,461
Please! I'll be late!

685
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:51,547
You're not going anywhere
dressed like that.

686
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,924
I mean, really, Eileen,
how dare you?

687
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:56,718
That's the dress your mother
wore to my father's funeral.

688
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,929
You got no respect for anyone.

689
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,472
Get changed.

690
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,850
I don't want anyone
seeing you in that getup.

691
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,268
They'll think I'm dead.

692
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,317
Ah. Miss Dunlop?

693
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,862
May I, um, may I have a word?

694
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:17,197
Oh, Jesus.

695
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,699
It's about your father.

696
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,909
Him? Go talk to him.
He's inside.

697
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:22,244
It's about his gun.

698
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:23,495
This oughta be good.

699
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:25,664
Pray tell, Buck.

700
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,124
Uh, yesterday,

701
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,084
we got several complaints
from neighbors,

702
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:30,752
from Miss Connie
down at the school,

703
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,963
that, uh, Chief Dunlop

704
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:36,592
was sitting
in that north-facing window

705
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,178
and, uh, pointing his weapon

706
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,655
at children walking home
from school.

707
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,975
He has agreed to relinquish
the property into your care.

708
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:47,311
As long as you promise
not to use it on him.

709
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,645
His words.

710
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,814
May I come in?

711
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:55,110
Want to hang it on me
like an ornament?

712
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:56,361
Aw.

713
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,238
I'm sure that Miss Dunlop

714
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,365
will take excellent care
of the weapon, sir.

715
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:03,660

Buck, as you can see.

Sure. I'll hold.

726
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,761
Ah, look what
the cat dragged in.

727
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,179
Good afternoon, Eileen.

728
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,288
You look fresh as a daisy,
as always.

729
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,581
I had car trouble.

730
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:51,124
Yeah, I believe
the trouble part.

731
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,335
It's almost Christmas.
Can you give me a break?

732
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:55,295
No. Get to work.

733
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,631
Okay. I need the Polk file.

734
00:45:57,673 --> 00:45:59,174
Yeah.

735
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,218
I think Dr. St. John has it.

736
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,679
Perfect.
Yeah, I'm afraid that one

737
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,722
will have to wait
till after the holidays.

738
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:07,432
We have a new doctor on staff,

739
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,893
and, uh, apparently she
doesn't follow procedures.

740
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,895
- She's not in today?
- Been and gone.

741
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:13,164
She's gonna be back
after Christmas.

742
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:14,249
Yeah. Will do.

743
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:15,816
All right, then. Thank you.

744
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,150
Bye-bye.

745
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,368
Where do you think you're going?

746
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,828
The infirmary.

747
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,496
I think something's
going around.

748
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:31,578
You look like
you've been going around.

749
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,667
She's a boozer.

750
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:25,964
Dad?

751
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,519
Dad?

752
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:52,824
Dad?

753
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:54,051
Dad, can you hear me?

754
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,660
Dad, can you hear me?

755
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,430
- What were you doing up there?
- I need my gun.

756
00:49:57,454 --> 00:49:58,497
- Sit up.
- It's after me.

757
00:49:58,538 --> 00:49:59,498
Nobody's after you.

758
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:01,082
Sit up. Sit up.

759
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:11,927
Joanie.

760
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,678
That you, Joanie?

761
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,973
Hey.

762
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,601
Joanie. Joanie.

763
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:21,228
Joanie.

764
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:22,896
Dad.

765
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:26,149
Quit your fussing, Joanie.

766
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:38,537
We stitched him up,

767
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:40,121
and I don't think
he has a concussion,

768
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,623
but his blood alcohol level

769
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:43,333
is point one-seven.

770
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,377
His liver's enlarged,
and he's covered in bruises.

771
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:46,812
I'm not blaming you, honey,
but, uh...

772
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,255
Yeah, sure.

773
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,006
Hey, who's letting him
live like this?

774
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,259
I don't know. My mom died,
and he doesn't have a job.

775
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,927
What else is he supposed to do?

776
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:55,571
Yeah, there are men
who don't drink all day.

777
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,389
I know that.

778
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,101
Look, I know this
is hard for you, but, uh...

779
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,436
if he stops drinking,
he might die,

780
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:06,189
but if he keeps drinking,
it'll definitely kill him.

781
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,149
I don't know what else
to say to you.

782
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,325
Sit down, Dad.

783
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,587
The doctor told me
you're gonna die.

784
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,213
Oh, like he's not?

785
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,383
He said, if you
keep drinking like this,

786
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:34,634
it'll kill you.

787
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:36,344
Screw him.

788
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:37,738
You know they killed
your mother at that hospital.

789
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,472
They owe me more than stitches.

790
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,058
Can you lean back?

791
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,476
Course I can lean back.

792
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,437
You don't think
I know how to go to bed?

793
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,690
Well, I need a drink.

794
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:50,025
Dad!

795
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,651
And anyway, I do not sleep here.

796
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,486
- It's haunted.
- Please, Dad.

797
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:56,698
If I get you a bottle,
will you lie down?

798
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,784
No. I want to have
a drink with my daughter.

799
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,787
You're different these days.

800
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,623
You're almost interesting.

801
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:14,799
What are you doing with all
the money you make at work?

802
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,262
Why don't you ever buy
your own clothes?

803
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:29,564
I remember that coat.

804
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:31,733
I remember your mother...

805
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,195
How does it look on me?

806
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,281
Well, your mother
looked beautiful in that coat.

807
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:40,158
I bought it for her to wear

808
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,452
when she got out
of the bug house.

809
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:46,831
I always loved your mother.

810
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,935
No matter what you
thought it looked like,

811
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,211
I always loved her.

812
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:56,466
And I know
what people say about me.

813
00:52:56,508 --> 00:52:59,844
They say I made her crazy
'cause I'm a hard-ass.

814
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,140
And I may have yelled
a few times,

815
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,810
but she always forgave me.

816
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,773
Because we loved each other.

817
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:14,067
Love will make you crazy,
Eileen.

818
00:53:16,152 --> 00:53:18,655
You'll probably
never understand that.

819
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:19,989
Why?

820
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:24,953
Some people...

821
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:26,705
they're the real people.

822
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:31,501
Like in a movie, they're
the ones you're watching.

823
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:33,503
They're the ones making moves.

824
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:37,924
And the other people...

825
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:43,096
they're just there
filling the space,

826
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,473
and you take 'em for granted.

827
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:47,434
You think, "They're easy."

828
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:51,187
Take a penny, leave a penny.

829
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:57,694
That's you, Eileen.

830
00:53:58,737 --> 00:54:00,363
You're one of them.

831
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,474
What are you doing?
You don't gotta lock it.

832
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,184
Let's go.

833
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,578
Come on. Come on.

834
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:32,312
Come on. It's cold out here.

835
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,313
Come on. Hurry up.

836
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,440
Open the door.

837
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,528
Fucking heavy.

838
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,329
Give me my fucking drink.

839
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:17,357
Eileen!

840
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,070
Eileen!

841
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:26,658
What, Dad?

842
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,243
Phone rang.

843
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:29,828
Some woman looking for you.

844
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:32,038
What'd you say?

845
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,206
Nothing.

846
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:36,334
I know nothing. I said nothing.

847
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:44,551
Hello.

848
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:46,427
Hello, Christmas angel.

849
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,264
Rebecca?

850
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:51,724
Look, I was just thinking
of you,

851
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,184
and, well, I-I don't know

852
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:54,703
what you're planning
for Christmas Eve,

853
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,604
but I thought maybe
you'd like to come over.

854
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:58,040
There are some records
we could play,

855
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,233
and maybe dance again
if all goes well.

856
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:04,863
Unless you have
a better offer, of course.

857
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:07,198
I don't have a better offer.

858
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,950
- So you'll come?
- Yeah.

859
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:10,869
Let me give you the address.

860
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,662
Okay. Hold on.

861
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:17,709
It's 32 Maple Street.

862
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,670
So see you later.

863
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:23,172
- Bye.
- Bye.

It's a Christmas miracle.

Sorry it took me so long.

I think that cat's possessed.

886
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:58,601
Merry Christmas.

887
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:01,062
Oh. Aren't you a peach?

888

Come in! Come in.

889
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,400
Eileen, um,

890
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:07,151
I'm sorry the place
is such a mess.

891
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:09,487
I-I haven't... I mean,
I tried to clean it up a bit,

892
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:10,965
but it's just beyond me.

893
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:13,157
I hope it doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

894
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:14,742
Let's open this wine.

895
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,705
Uh, sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

you are... ♪

897

I hope you didn't have
to drive far. Was it far?

898
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:27,046
Uh, no.
I drive all over the place.

899
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:28,464
Let me take your coat.

900
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:31,467
- Thanks.
- Oh, my.

901
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:32,927
It's so nice and soft.

902
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,595
It's my mother's.

903
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:37,640
Well, uh, she must have
been a real classy lady

904
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:39,892
to have such a classy daughter.

905
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:42,562
She was something
of a clotheshorse, actually.

906
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,165
I hope it's a kind you like.

907
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,941
Oh. I'm sure it's delicious.

908
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:48,818
Drink sounds nice, actually.

909
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,570
Let's see where
the corkscrew's hiding.

910
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,488
Uh, you know,

911
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,366
I have just been so busy lately

912
00:58:55,408 --> 00:58:57,785
that I can't seem
to remember where the...

913
00:58:57,827 --> 00:59:00,580
But it's got to be here
under all this mess, right?

914
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,415
You know what?

915
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:05,376
A very handy young PhD student
once taught me a trick

916
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:08,755
for how to open a bottle
if you're ever stranded

917
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,339
without a corkscrew.

918
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:18,264
Philosophers are always
the biggest drunks.

919
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:22,518
Although he was kind of cute.

920
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:29,650
Eugene Henderson, Harvard.

921
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:31,778
I had no idea you could do that.

922
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,112
That was a great trick.

923
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:35,031
Mm-hmm.

924
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:36,574
Now we need some glasses.

925
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:38,201
Ah.

926
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,789
So to Eileen,
my Christmas savior.

927
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,248
Savior?

928
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,541
I didn't do anything.

929
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,126
Well, you're being a friend.

930
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:49,128
That's everything. Cheers.

No. That's a...

00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:00,348

No.

943
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:25,623
Oh, uh, sure.

944
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:27,708
I, uh...
No, I can't have roommates.

945
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,877
I, um,
I like my own space.

946
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,295
I still like to have fun,

947
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:33,506
and, uh, I can make
a lot of noise.

948
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,967
And, uh, I can
make a mess, as you can see,

949
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:38,594
but, uh, I can play music
as loud as I want to.

950
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:39,971
I can...

951
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,557
I can scream
as loud as I want to.

952
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,981
I can't stand roommates, either.

953
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,899
In college,
I had to lock my door...

954
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:53,860
Oh, that's right.
You were in college.

955
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:54,902
What'd you study?

956
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:56,529
Just the required courses.

957
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,281
Um, if I hadn't left,

958
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,867
I probably would have
ended up a secretary anyway.

959
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,577
Eileen, you're not
really a secretary.

960
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,263
Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Stevens,
they're secretaries,

961
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:05,788
'cause they do
what they're told,

962
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,499
and that's why they're
miserable and nasty.

963
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:11,210
But you, you got a big life
ahead of you, I'm sure.

964
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,714
Okay. I'm not a real secretary.

965
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,549
No, you're not.

966
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:18,301
- 'Cause you're smart.
- Mm.

967
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,680
And you're curious, aren't you?

968
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:25,308
Mm, I never really did
very good in school,

969
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,226
so I'm just kind of average,
I think.

970
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:28,978
Oh, don't say that, Eileen.

971
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,831
Never say that. Do you...?

972
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:36,569
You really think
you're a normal person?

973
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,113
Normal how?

974
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:46,954
I really am a bad hostess.

975
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:48,331
Maybe we'll, uh...

976
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,833
We'll feel better
if we eat something.

977
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,627
I feel fine.

978
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:00,509
Can I use your bathroom?

979
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:03,429

What do you have
to be sorry for?

996
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:14,101
Go on. Go on. Eat. Eat. Yeah.

997
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:16,562
Have a pickle, too.

998
01:04:16,604 --> 01:04:19,482
Why do we need
a little, uh, cheese knife?

999
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,025
To keep our hands clean?

1000
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:22,735
No. It's all ridiculous.

1001
01:04:23,778 --> 01:04:25,529
Everything is.

1002
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:27,865
All these stupid traditions,

1003
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:31,452
like the-the warden
and his prison at Christmas.

1004
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:33,120
What do you mean?

1005
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:35,498
I've tried explaining
how things need to change,

1006
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,833
but all he cares about

1007
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,644
is whether or not the boys
are gonna think about me

1008
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,879
while they molest themselves
in their cells at night.

1009
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:43,672
God forbid.

1010
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:45,091
There's a strict

1011
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:46,967
no masturbation policy
at Moorehead.

1012
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:49,720
It's illegal
to get off in prison.

1013
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:52,014
You know that, right?

1014
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:54,016
As if that's
the downfall of civilization,

1015
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:55,768
people having orgasms.

1016
01:04:57,103 --> 01:04:59,146
You can't count on men
to fix anything.

1017
01:04:59,188 --> 01:05:02,525
People are so ashamed
of their desires,

1018
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,110
especially men.

1019
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:11,867
Eileen...

1020
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:16,247
as you can probably tell by now,

1021
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,999
I live a little differently
than most people.

1022
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:21,001
No, your house i-is nice.

1023
01:05:21,043 --> 01:05:23,212
- No.
- It's cozy.

1024
01:05:23,254 --> 01:05:25,631
I don't mean the house.
I mean...

1025
01:05:25,673 --> 01:05:28,259
I have my own ideas.

1026
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:33,514
Maybe you and I
share some of those ideas.

1027
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,976
What kind of ideas do we share?

1028
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,400
May I confide in you?

1029
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:47,027
Of course.

1030
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,532
It's about Lee Polk.

1031
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:55,035
- It is?
- Yes.

1032
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:56,495
Tell me, honey...

1033
01:05:58,164 --> 01:06:01,208
what would make a person
want to kill their father?

1034
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,295
Everybody wants
to kill their father.

1035
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:06,922
No, they don't.
Who told you that?

1036
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:09,675
Really, think about it, Eileen.

1037
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:12,928
Because Lee snuck
into his parents' bedroom

1038
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,889
in the middle of the night...

1039
01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:17,975
hacked through
his father's throat

1040
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:19,560
with an old kitchen knife,

1041
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:22,396
and stabbed him
in the chest repeatedly.

1042
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:26,358
His mother claimed she thought
there'd been a break-in.

1043
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,003
How do you sleep
through something like that?

1044
01:06:28,027 --> 01:06:29,528
I don't know.

1045
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,780
You don't.
That's why I called her in.

1046
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,365
I mean, you were there.

1047
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:34,968
The poor boy
could barely look at her, so...

1048
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:37,536
so afterwards,
I just asked him point-blank.

1049
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:38,787
I said...

1050
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,459
I said,
"What'd your father do to you?"

1051
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:48,589
"What made you want to do that
to your father's body?"

1052
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:53,594
And he spilled it all
in a matter of minutes.

1053
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:56,180
Nobody had ever bothered
to ask him before.

1054
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,725
No one had thought to ask.

1055
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:00,726
Wouldn't you want to know?

1056
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:02,770
Wouldn't you be curious?

1057
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,313
Yes.

1058
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,071
Do you want to know?

1059
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:15,199
Yes.

1060
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:18,827
Eileen, you can never
tell anyone. Do you understand?

1061
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,079
You understa... Promise me.

1062
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,163
Promise.

1063
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:27,127
♪ What happened
to the love... ♪

1064
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:29,713
The first thing
you need to know,

1065
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,131
this isn't my house.

1066
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,466
This is the Polk house.

1067
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:34,510
I have Mrs. Polk
tied up downstairs.

1068
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:48,357
Eileen. Eileen.

1069
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,527
Eileen.

1070
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:52,903
Eileen, please wait.

1071
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:54,321
Eileen, please.

1072
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:55,948
I thought I could
do this alone, Eileen.

1073
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,117
Please don't go. Eileen!

1074
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,202
Please, don't go. Please.

1075
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:03,038
I thought you invited me
over here 'cause you liked me.

1076
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,915
Oh, I do.

1077
01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:07,668
I do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please, Eileen.

1078
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,312
Just pl-please, Eileen.
Just give me a moment.

1079
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:10,754
Please just let me explain.

1080
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,339
I need...

1081
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:13,632
I need a friend.

1082
01:08:20,014 --> 01:08:22,600
I came here yesterday afternoon

1083
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,184
to talk to Mrs. Polk.

1084
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:26,729
I said I could see
that she was upset

1085
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,230
after our meeting with Lee,

1086
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:30,190
was there anything
she wanted to discuss.

1087
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:33,485
She said, "Nothing," so I...

1088
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:35,070
I pressed her.

1089
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:39,158
I told her what Lee had told me.

1090
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:43,329
She spat at me,
called me the pervert,

1091
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,997
then called her husband a saint,

1092
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:48,792
and I left my card,
told her to think about it.

1093
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:51,462
I knew she wouldn't call.
Then I left.

1094
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,592
Now, I couldn't sleep
last night.

1095
01:08:57,593 --> 01:08:59,219
'Cause I...

1096
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,847
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Lee had told me,

1097
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:03,390
what his father had done,

1098
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:06,268
and how his mother
had let it happen.

1099
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,063
I don't even remember the drive
over here, I was so angry.

1100
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:11,815
Suddenly I was pushing past her,

1101
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,359
saying, "How could you do it?

1102
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,277
How could you be complicit
in such torture?"

1103
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,112
And she snapped.

1104
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:19,531
She attacked me. See?

1105
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:21,200
See?

1106
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,868
So I defended myself.

1107
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:24,995
We fought, and I...
I don't know what happened,

1108
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:27,414
but somehow we fell down
the stairs to the basement.

1109
01:09:27,456 --> 01:09:29,958
I-I thought she
was gonna kill me,

1110
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,212
so I hit her with a chair
and tied her up.

1111
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,757
I tried to talk
to her rationally,

1112
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,426
to explain that I was here
to help Lee,

1113
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:42,888
that-that I could help her,
too, if she'd let me,

1114
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,224
but... but she just
kept screaming

1115
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,518
that-that I'd kidnapped her
and her husband was a cop

1116
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:48,977
and I was gonna go to jail.

1117
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:54,149
So I found some codeine
in a bathroom,

1118
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:55,818
and got her to be quiet.

1119
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,695
Then I called you.

1120
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:01,573
Because, as you can see,
I'm in a bit of a pinch.

1121
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:04,952
What can I do?

1122
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:07,287
I need Mrs. Polk to confess,

1123
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:10,457
and I need a witness,
two against one.

1124
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:12,251
You understand?

1125
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,506
Oh, I can't go to jail.

1126
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,016
Okay.

1127
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,566
Okay.

1128
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:49,747
Wait here.

1129
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:51,623
Eileen. Wait...

1130
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:18,525
It's incredible.

1131
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:19,985
Why do you have that?

1132
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:21,254
Why did you bring that
around here?

1133
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,529
My dad's sick.

1134
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:26,450
Pick it up, and show me
how you're gonna hold it.

1135
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:34,500
That's very good, Eileen.

1136
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,963
All right.

1137
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,684
Be cool.

1138
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:25,342
Just tell us the truth,
Mrs. Polk,

1139
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:26,718
and we'll let you go free.

1140
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,687
Families can heal.

1141
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,856
You're not a lost cause.
No one is.

1142
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:40,232
It can't have been easy,

1143
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:42,818
being married
to a man like that.

1144
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,153
You're obviously
having a hard time.

1145
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:51,535
Why don't you tell us
what happened in this house,

1146
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:53,787
why you helped your husband
do what he did?

1147
01:12:53,829 --> 01:12:56,665
And then we'll be even,

1148
01:12:56,707 --> 01:13:00,836
and we can
all walk out of here, and...

1149
01:13:00,878 --> 01:13:03,463
and we can figure out
how to help Lee.

1150
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,726
Fucking untie me! Untie me!

1151
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,185
Let me out of here!

1152
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,147
You crazy bitch,
get out of my house!

1153
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,666
You're in big trouble,
you think you're gonna

1154
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,983
- get away with this!
- Eileen.

1155
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:25,944
You're going to jail
for a long time.

1156
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:28,238
What the hell
is she doing here?!

1157
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,865
What are you doing here?

1158
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:31,867
I really think you need
to tell us the truth.

1159
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,660
What the hell
are you talking about?!

1160
01:13:33,702 --> 01:13:35,078
If you don't...

1161
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,955
we could leave you
down here tied up,

1162
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:38,332
no one to find you.

1163
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,726
The human body
can't live very long

1164
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,418
without food and water.

1165
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,670
Sooner or later, you're
gonna need to take a shit.

1166
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:47,007
I guess you're just gonna
have to shit yourself.

1167
01:13:47,049 --> 01:13:48,926
And piss.

1168
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:50,469
It's not gonna feel very good.

1169
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,763
I'm not scared of you.

1170
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:54,806
I know you.

1171
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,433
I know who your dad is.

1172
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,644
If you know my dad,
then you oughta be scared.

1173
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:01,897
Yeah? Scared of a womanizing,
drunk piece of shit

1174
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:04,066
who everybody knows
is bat shit crazy?

1175
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:05,627
You think he didn't have
problems of his own?

1176
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:07,462
You think he didn't have
secrets of his own, huh?

1177
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:09,154
You think your mom
didn't know about 'em?

1178
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:10,280
Think it didn't...

1179
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:12,908
I am going to fucking kill you

1180
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:16,495
if you don't start talking
right now!

1181
01:14:18,205 --> 01:14:20,040
Please!

1182
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:22,209
Please, don't kill me.

1183
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,671
I won't have to kill you
if you talk.

1184
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:41,853
I can't.

1185
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:45,399
No, please.

1186
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,567
She's not gonna help you. Talk.

1187
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,528
I can't help you
unless you confess.

1188
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:12,718
All right.

1189
01:15:16,388 --> 01:15:17,806
You win.

1190
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,271
When you get married

1191
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:26,189
and you have children...

1192
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:40,746
You take an oath
when you get married

1193
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:44,166
to honor and obey your husband.

1194
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,334
You wouldn't understand that.

1195
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:49,963
At first, I...

1196
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:52,049
At first, I just,
I thought Mitch

1197
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,885
was just checking on him
in his sleep,

1198
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:56,595
you know, like any father would,

1199
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,930
like he, he just wanted
to be sure

1200
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:01,600
his son was safe and sound
in bed.

1201
01:16:03,185 --> 01:16:04,686
Sometimes I'd...

1202
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:07,647
feel him getting out of bed,

1203
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:11,318
and sometimes I'd just
feel him when he'd come back.

1204
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:15,447
And he'd...

1205
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:18,075
kiss me or...

1206
01:16:18,116 --> 01:16:20,535
hold me and...

1207
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:23,246
You know?

1208
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:25,832
And we hadn't
really been together

1209
01:16:25,874 --> 01:16:27,250
since Lee'd been born.

1210
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:34,049
But then I...

1211
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:38,053
I started getting
these infections down there.

1212
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,433
I figured it was my fault.

1213
01:16:44,935 --> 01:16:46,520
And then I wondered if Mitch

1214
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:48,730
had brought something home
with him, you know?

1215
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,740
Then one time...

1216
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:01,701
I got up
in the middle of the night.

1217
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:06,581
I don't remember why.

1218
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,084
Glass of water? I don't know.

1219
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:16,883
I thought-I thought
maybe it was a dream.

1220
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,468
I...

1221
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:23,557
I went-I went and looked in.

1222
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:31,773
It didn't dawn on me right away.

1223
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:34,484
You know,
I-I swear to you. I...

1224
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:36,069
I mean...

1225
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:42,492
You don't expect your husband's

1226
01:17:42,534 --> 01:17:45,120
gonna do something like that,
you know?

1227
01:17:45,162 --> 01:17:47,664
I mean, nobody
would believe it, anyway.

1228
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,085
And then I... and then...

1229
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:55,422
And then I figured...

1230
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,382
And then I figured,
if Lee was clean...

1231
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:07,517
If he was clean,

1232
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:10,645
an enema
and a bath before bed...

1233
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:15,650
then it would be better
for all of us.

1234
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:18,612
And it was.

1235
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,034
I knew what I was doing,
it wasn't...

1236
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:25,535
it wasn't quite right.

1237
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:27,871
I did know that. I did.

1238
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:31,625
But who do you tell? You know?

1239
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,501
Who could I tell?

1240
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:39,507
I mean, you do the best you can.

1241
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:44,846
You know what happens
when you have children?

1242
01:18:47,015 --> 01:18:48,975
Your husband
never looks at you the same.

1243
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,523
But after he went to bed
with Lee,

1244
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:57,400
he'd come to me.

1245
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:04,407
It was like a big burden
had been lifted.

1246
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,451
He was, he was relaxed.

1247
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:11,873
It felt good, how he'd hold me.

1248
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:14,793
He loved me then.

1249
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:19,881
He would whisper and kiss me.

1250
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:24,469
It was the way
it had been before...

1251
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,057
when we were young
and happy and in love.

1252
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,353
It felt good.

1253
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:38,149
Is that so wrong...

1254
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:41,111
to want to feel like that?

1255
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:47,492
You wouldn't understand.

1256
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:52,163
You're young, you haven't
had your heart broken.

1257
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:01,256
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding!

1258
01:20:01,298 --> 01:20:02,924
Help me! Help me!

1259
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:04,718
Please! Plea... Help me!

1260
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,636
- I'm bleeding!
- Shh! Shh!

1261
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:08,281
- Help me! You'll be sorry!
- Eileen, help me!

1262
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:10,640
I'll tell everyone
what you've done!

1263
01:20:10,682 --> 01:20:12,642
- Eileen!
- A doctor!

1264
01:20:12,684 --> 01:20:14,227
Get a doctor!

1265
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:17,355
- Get me out of here!
- Eileen, help me!

1266
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:20,025
Help me!

1267
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,902
No! No!

1268
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:31,494
No.

1269
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:33,204
No! No!

1270
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,706
No! No!

1271
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,667
Okay. Okay.

1272
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:37,560
Why did you shoot her?

1273
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:40,438
I was upset.

1274
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:45,902
What do we do now?

1275
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:59,040
We take her to my house.

1276
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:06,339
My dad's always
whipping his gun out.

1277
01:22:06,381 --> 01:22:07,966
Everyone knows it.

1278
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:13,304
We can make it look like
he shot her in a blackout.

1279
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:19,310
He's just a drunk
piece of shit, right?

1280
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,980
He's gonna die anyway
or go crazy.

1281
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:24,107
The doctor said so.

1282
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:26,234
So let's take her together
and leave.

1283
01:22:26,276 --> 01:22:29,904
Then we could go to New York
for the New Year...

1284
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:32,407
just the two of us.

1285
01:22:35,452 --> 01:22:37,620
I love you.

1286
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:42,500
It's okay.

1287
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:46,463
Come on.

1288
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:48,882
All right.

1289
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,204
You go ahead
to your father's house.

1290
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:03,438
Wait for me there.

1291
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,814
- Yeah.
- I'll clean up inside.

1292
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:06,125
We can't leave
any evidence behind.

1293
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:07,509
- I'll be waiting.
- I'll be quick.

1294
01:27:02,927 --> 01:27:04,846
Eileen.

1295
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,310
Eileen.

1296
01:27:14,105 --> 01:27:16,399
Go back to sleep, Dad.

1297
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:20,069
Where you going?

1298
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:54,520
I might just get on the road.

1299
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:00,276
