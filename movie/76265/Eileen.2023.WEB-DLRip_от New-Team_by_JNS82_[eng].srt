Eileen.

36
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,503
Eileen!

37
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,376
I need form I-37.

38
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,768
- Transfer form?
- No.

39
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,031
Intake. I-37.

40
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,033
Aren't you listening?

41
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,513
She is useless.

42
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,689
Dr. Frye
still needs to sign it.

43
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,822
He's probably asleep
in his office.

44
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,650
Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,478
Maybe you could go
wake up Dr. Frye.

46
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,175
Blow softly in his ear.

47
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,872
- He loves that.

48
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,309
Leave Eileen alone.

49
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,962
She's tired.

50
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:13,051
Oh, is that what it is?

51
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,184
I thought maybe it was
that time of the month.

52
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,099
At least I have
a time of the month.

53
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,840
Oh, yeah.
You know something, honey?

54
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,755
It won't last forever.
You'll be old like us soon.

55
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,585
Mrs. Nelson
to the visiting area, please.

56
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,891
Mrs. Nelson
to the visiting area.

57
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:53,265
I'm not gonna fight
with anybody. I told you.

58
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,441
How's Mickey doing?

59
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,833
I'm trying to be good.

60
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,139
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

61
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,401
Well, it's not my fault...

62
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,421
Maybe I'll see you next time.

63
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,904
As much as we're
gonna miss the old dog,

64
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,602
I hope you'll all be welcoming

65
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,647
to Dr. Frye's replacement
on Monday.

66
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,475
A fine, fine young doctor.

67
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:15,478
Yes, well, let's hope
the boys take her seriously.

68
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:16,740
I'll take her.

69
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,917
- Seriously.

70
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,354
I think you will be
taking your insulin

71
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,965
and your retirement package.

72
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,357
That'll be enough for you.

73
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,794
DR. FRYE [laughing]:
That's right.

74
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,666
I'll really miss
all the fun around here.

75
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,407
Let's hear it for Dr. Frye.

76
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,409
Cheers!

77
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,916
I see a lot of Anne these days.

78
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,006
Yeah, a lot
of broken hearts out there.

79
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,834
Hey, hon.

80
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,313
Hey.

81
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:09,489
How's your dad?

82
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,666
Good.

83
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,756
You know what? Let me get that.

84
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,801
Thanks.

85
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,557
...want you to go inside
and shut the fuck up!

86
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,298
You shut... you shut up!

87
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,865
Fuck off! Shut up!
You shut up!

88
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:39,562
Fucking booze bag!
Oh, I'll do...

89
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,521
- I'm gonna have a drink.
- You all right there, chief?

90
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,131
You can fuck right off.

91
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:45,220
Goddamn Lutherans next door
are the problem, not me.

92
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,309
Nobody's complaining.
We just want to make sure

93
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:48,702
you're getting home
safe and sound.

94
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:49,790
Nobody's complaining?

95
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,834
- Dad.
- Safe and sound?

96
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,009
Why wouldn't I be safe
and sound?

97
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,445
Dad.

98
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,882
I keep the whole fucking
neighborhood safe and sound.

99
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:55,665
- What do you know?
- Dad.

100
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,101
E-Eileen, go inside.

101
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,103
- Okay. Dad, look to me.
- Go inside.

102
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,409
Come on. Please. Please.

103
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,193
Hey! You're causing a scene.

104
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:04,848
Trust me, Eileen.
Nobody wants nothing with you.

105
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,284
- Okay.
- Mwah!

106
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,895
- Come on. Go inside.
- Mwah!

107
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,636
Goddamn Lutherans right there.

108
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,638
Your mother always hated
those people.

109
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:14,554
- Gosh, let's go inside.
- They can fuck off. Sure.

110
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,294
You can't go around
policing people, Dad.

111
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,906
Who says?
You know who that guy was?

112
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,385
We got it all
under control, chief.

113
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,865
You can take it easy. Please.

114
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:24,085
Take it easy?
Y-You fuckin' take it easy.

115
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,390
You're not a cop anymore.

116
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,696
Yeah, sure.

117
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,306
I didn't want to retire.
They made me,

118
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:29,612
'cause I was
too goddamn good at it.

119
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,005
Look, I gotta get
back to the station.

120
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,093
Pour me a drink. Good.

121
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,268
Get back to the station, Buck.

122
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,748
Give me my drink.

123
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,619
Just give us a call
if you need anything.

124
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,142
Merry Christmas.

125
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,456
Hey, come here.
What's that smell?

126
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,631
Did you step in something?

127
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,981
No. Why? What do you smell?

128
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,156
I don't know. Roadkill.

129
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,595
Maybe you should
keep your distance.

130
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,250
Yeah, I'll keep my distance.

131
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,426
The fuck you doing?
Put my fucking shoes back on.

132
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,472
But maybe
you should be nicer to me.

133
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,517
No one else is gonna
put up with your shit.

134
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,345
Go then, 'cause I got Joanie.

135
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,261
She wouldn't keep a place
looking like this.

136
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:12,263
She's a real woman,
your sister.

137
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,178
And she smells like a woman.

138
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,876
She knows how to keep a house!

139
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:19,314
And she doesn't live here,
and she's married!

140
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:21,925
Yeah, 'cause she's
not a hanger-on.

141
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,840
And she doesn't want
to talk to you!

142
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,149
Yeah, sure, 'cause she's
made a life of her own.

143
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,933
She's made something
of herself.

144
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,416
Whatever, Dad.

145
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,679
Get a life, Eileen. Get a clue.

146
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,518
Shit.

147
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,616
Fuck it.

148
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,521
All right, listen up!

149
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,438
As you know, in the new year,

150
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,745
we will be up for state review.

151
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,488
So we're gonna be
tightening our procedures

152
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:36,581
and implementing new strategies
based on some big, new ideas.

153
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,977
And on that note,
this new young lady to my left,

154
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,588
Dr. Miss Rebecca St. John,

155
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:46,504
is our new prison psychologist.

156
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:50,073
She's just finished
her doctorate at Radcliffe.

157
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,553
Harvard.

158
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,555
Ah. Harvard.

159
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,035
We may not be Harvard people,

160
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,211
but I think
we can keep up with her,

161
00:12:57,211 --> 00:13:00,518
and hopefully she can
keep up with us

162
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,956
as we keep up with them.

163
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,872
She may be easy on the eyes,
but I assure you,

164
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,743
she is very smart.

165
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:11,616
Ladies, I hope you
show Miss St. John around...

166
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,372
Say, how much for a glazed?

167
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,810
They're free.

168
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,247
I'm kidding.

169
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,250
I'm Rebecca.

170
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,860
I know.

171
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,559
Say, where can a girl
get freshened up around here?

172
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,083
I can show you.

173
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,215
Sure. Appreciate it.

174
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,564
Can I take your jacket?

175
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,523
Aren't you sweet? Thanks.

176
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:50,873
This way.

177
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,876
I don't think
I caught your name.

178
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,095
Eileen.

179
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,184
- Morning.
- Morning.

180
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,489
Where you from?

181
00:13:58,489 --> 00:13:59,751
Huh?

182
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,318
Oh, I'm from New York originally.

183
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:02,885
- Manhattan.

184
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,758
Couldn't stand Cambridge.
Way too uptight.

185
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,456
Well, there were a couple
of interesting people,

186
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:11,198
but, no, I needed a break.

187
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,764
Get some fresh air.

188
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,549
And I love the beach.

189
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,466
All right.

190
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,642
32...

191
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,125
24...

192
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,431
...34.

193
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,911
Practically my measurements.

194
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,479
You know, some women
think their figures

195
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,568
are the only thing
that matters.

196
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,700
Honestly, I think
that's kind of pathetic.

197
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,181
I completely agree.

198
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:40,401
My sister's like that,
and she's not very smart.

199
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:41,968
Mm, good. Then you and I

200
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,927
have better things to discuss
than our figures.

201
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,799
Although that isn't
the popular opinion,

202
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,105
wouldn't you say?

203
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,759
I don't care what's popular.

204
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,936
Well, look at you.

205
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,546
A regular Katharine Hepburn.

206
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,722
Rare to meet a young woman
with so much gumption.

207
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,202
I'm like that, too.

208
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:02,118
I don't give a rat's ass
what people think.

209
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,380
They're probably scared of you.

210
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,121
Moi?

211
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,298
All right. See you around.

212
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,564
- Every year,

213
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,392
we hold this special assembly

214
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:17,873
to celebrate the birth
of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

215
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:20,093
And every year,
one of you sick bastards

216
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,746
ruins it for the rest of us.

217
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:26,664
Well, you've disrespected
Christmas for the last time

218
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,797
because this year,
you're gonna sit on your hands,

219
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,799
you're gonna zip your lips.

220
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,193
If I see any of you biting,
kicking, screaming, pushing,

221
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,586
pulling hair,
laughing, moaning,

222
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,546
or I hear one wayward comment,

223
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,722
you're going
straight to the cave.

224
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,985
And now, without further ado,

225
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,641
it is my honor to thank
the people from Mount Olive

226
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,425
who helped me direct
the pageant again this year...

227
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,253
Yay, Mount Olive.
- and present to you

228
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:53,039
"Christmas in Prison."

229
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:08,010
I'm gonna kill someone
on Christmas.

230
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,664
Shut up!

231
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,848
Oh, what am I to do?

232
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,893
Sentenced for three years
to sit indoors

233
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,070
among boys of my same creed,
plain bad.

234
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,072
- So much time to plot

235
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,552
what evildoings I'll undertake
as soon as I get out.

236
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,293
You want some cake, you fatty?!

237
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,295
In the meantime,
I suppose I could read a book.

238
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,297
You can't read, motherfucker!

239
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,522
Fucking Shakespeare up here.

240
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,270
I'm scrappy right now.

241
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,272
Book of truth!

242
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,975
Oh, look at McAllister.

243
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:01,194
- Fucking McAllister.

244
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,934
Hey, nice rack!

245
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,590
Well, I'm-I'm pretty tired.

246
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,592
Can we rest in that barn
over there?

247
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,072
Better than paying for a motel.

248
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,900
You're the best, Joseph.

249
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,033
Thank you for taking us here
to be counted in the census.

250
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,164
Fuck this shit!

251
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,470
Guard!
Wait.

252
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,862
- Wait. Wait, wait.
Hey, grab him.

253
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:26,480
Move back!

254
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,889
All you guys sit down!

255
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,500
Sit the fuck down!

256
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:49,764
Hey, Bob.

257
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:50,808
Hey, hon.

258
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,245
This and a pack of Luckies.

259
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,248
Oh! It's a lucky day, huh?

260
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,901
Yeah, the luckiest.

261
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,426
Yup. Cigarettes are great.

262
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:04,518
Don't light yourself on fire.

263
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,486
You're in a good mood,
what's wrong with you?

264
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,488
Nothing's wrong, Dad.

265
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,454
You look funny with that thing
in your mouth.

266
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,371
How was your day, Dad?

267
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:32,894
How was my day?

268
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,114
I don't know.

269
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,941
It was a day, just another day.

270
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,508
What's the point?

271
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:42,382
My day was a doozy.

272
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,601
Oh, yeah?

273
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,735
A big fight broke out
at the Christmas pageant.

274
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:50,520
Kid got his collarbone broken,

275
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,523
and I had to do all
this paperwork for the warden.

276
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,917
Don't ash on the floor,
it's tacky.

277
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,660
Anyway...

278
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,793
It was one of those days
you never forget.

279
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,839
Oh, yeah?
Days I'll never forget.

280
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,929
Let me see.

281
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,192
December 16, 1944,

282
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,630
first time I ever held
a dead man's head in my lap.

283
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,024
What a waste.

284
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:18,418
20 degrees outside and snowing.

285
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,769
Just like it is here.

286
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,337
Don't know why I ever
came back to this place.

287
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:27,601
Maybe because you had a wife
and two kids.

288
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,255
Maybe.

289
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,213
I love the beach.

290
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,433
Oh, yeah? Good for you.

291
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,565
War kind of ruined beaches
for me.

292
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,915
So what else?

293
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:40,570
How's that Polk kid?
He talked yet?

294
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,615
Huh?

295
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:42,964
Polk.

296
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,748
The kid who stabbed
his father...

297
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,752
...who was a good cop,
more or less.

298
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,888
What kind of kid thinks of
killing his father like that?

299
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,239
Stab him in his sleep...

300
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,980
in front of his mother.

301
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,853
Then he just sits down.

302
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,899
Never denies it.

303
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,075
Never says a word
the whole trial.

304
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,035
Psychopathic.

305
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,172
Course I wouldn't
have to worry about you

306
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,087
doing something like that,
now, would I?

307
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,220
'Cause you're a girl.

308
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
Can't imagine you with a knife.

309
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:26,486
Can you imagine me with a gun?

310
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,055
Yeah, I can see it.

311
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,668
One day...

312
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:38,062
when you've had enough
and you feel like, uh...

313
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,760
ducking out.

314
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,285
Maybe when I'm dead and gone

315
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,374
and you got nobody
and you never will.

316
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,247
I could imagine that.

317
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,729
But you wouldn't, would you?

318
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,428
'Cause you're too good.

319
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,304
Say, give me
one of those cigarettes.

320
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,350
What have you got, Old Gold?

321
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,786
No.

322
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,266
I like Old Gold.

323
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:12,096
I know.

324
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,290
Oopsie.

325
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,727
Do you need any help?

326
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:18,772
Uh, no, I'm okay.

327
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:20,251
Just butterfingers.

328
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,341
You should see me.

329
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,907
I'm a total klutz.

330
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,045
Oh, right.

331
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:33,395
Lee Polk.

332
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,832
That's not something
you see every day.

333
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,011
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

334
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:45,102
Bedtime reading?

335
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,975
I was just doing some filing.

336
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,849
That's some show yesterday.

337
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:55,504
They do it every year.

338
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:59,203
I'd call that
cruel and unusual punishment.

339
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:08,082
Sorry. I don't usually smoke.

340
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,692
It's a nasty habit.

341
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,302
That's why I like it.

342
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:12,826
Not very becoming
of a lady, though.

343
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,958
Turns your teeth yellow.

344
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,656
See?

345
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:18,745
That's cigarettes and coffee.

346
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,268
And red wine.

347
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:23,140
No, your teeth are perfect.

348
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,276
I don't drink coffee,

349
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,539
so my teeth
should be fine, but...

350
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,020
...they're all rotted

351
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,370
due to my extreme propensity
for sweets.

352
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,851
A propensity for sweets.

353
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,809
You don't get enough sweetness
in your life?

354
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,160
I just eat a lot of candy.

355
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,162
Mm. I wouldn't know it
to look at you.

356
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:46,468
You're so petite.

357
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,470
Being tall has its advantages,
of course,

358
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,560
but most men
are just too short for me.

359
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,998
Have you noticed,
or am I imagining things,

360
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:58,524
that men these days are
getting shorter and shorter,

361
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,917
balder, and fatter?

362
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,180
All the men around here
are little boys.

363
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,705
You're funny.

364
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,794
I meant outside this prison.

365
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:08,838
Although you're right.

366
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:11,188
The guards, the warden,

367
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,755
they're not much to look at.

368
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,844
You should have seen Dr. Frye.

369
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:17,586
He was really
pretty nasty looking.

370
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,370
That doesn't surprise me.

371
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,546
My office isn't very becoming,

372
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,461
and it all smells
of dirty leather.

373
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,201
I'm beginning to wonder
what went on in there.

374
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,595
Nothing good.

375
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,295
I mean, I never actually
been in that office.

376
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:34,081
Oh. Well, you should
come by sometime.

377
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,257
Although if the door's closed,

378
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,520
that means
I'm with one of the boys.

379
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay.

380
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:42,481
Aren't you ever scared

381
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,700
being alone in there with them?

382
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,354
No.

383
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,531
Come by, and see me sometime,
all right?

384
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,315
Although, you know, if you
hear me screaming in there,

385
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,143
feel free to kick down the door
and rescue me.

386
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:54,493
Okay.

387
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,582
I'm just kidding, honey.

388
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,931
There's a buzzer.

389
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:55,554
I'm here to see Leonard Polk.

390
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:58,818
Anne Polk.

391
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:04,911
You're not on the schedule.

392
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,303
Are you a late addition?

393
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,354
I-I was called.

394
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,486
I don't know, I-I'm here now.

395
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:17,488
Well, you need
to fill out a form.

396
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,884
Aren't you Chief Dunlop's kid?

397
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,104
Yeah.

398
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:25,453
I thought so.

399
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:28,674
Mrs. Polk? I'm Dr. St. John.

400
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,980
We spoke on the phone.
Thank you so much for coming.

401
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,112
Oh, no need
to bother with that.

402
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,114
We all know who you are.

403
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,510
Eileen, would you
help us with the door?

404
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,860
Thank you.

405
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,862
- It's this way.

406
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:45,952
Take your coat?

407
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,345
Please.

408
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:50,652
Thank you, Eileen.

409
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:55,875
After you.

410
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,851
Why are you doing this to me?

411
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,477
Huh?

412
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:35,392
You got something to say to me?

413
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:47,927
Let me out!

414
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:50,190
Let me out! Let me out!

415
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,758
Let me out!

416
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:58,067
Y-You do... y'all do
what you want with him.

417
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,287
Won't even talk
to his own mother?

418
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,289
He's always been a nasty boy.

419
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,074
A filthy, nasty boy!

420
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,120
I need to lock up.

421
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:11,820
Visitation hours were
actually over 20 minutes ago.

422
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,256
Oh, I-I understand.

423
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:17,434
Would you like to keep talking
in my office?

424
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:23,310
- Let's go.
- Turn around.

425
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,659
Oh, no.
That won't be necessary.

426
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,226
- I need to cuff him.
- No.

427
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,146
Don't worry, Lee.
It's all right.

428
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,982
That won't be necessary.

429
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:46,028
Don't do that. She's a doctor.

430
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:47,290
I think she needs a doctor.

431
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,335
That kid killed a cop.

432
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,293
He killed his father.

433
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,555
There's a difference.

434
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:58,214
REBECCA [muffled]: Oh, I'm so
sorry. Let me see who it is.

435
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,303
Oh, Eileen.

436
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:02,523
Um, can I help you?

437
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,396
You forgot your notebook.

438
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:08,050
Oh, thank you so much.

439
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,356
I actually need this.

440
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,271
Um, hope you didn't read it.

441
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:12,794
- No, of course not.
- Oh, no,

442
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,709
I'm just kidding.
It's just chicken scratch.

443
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,933
Wait. Eileen.

444
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:25,851
I don't mean to be forward,

445
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,027
and, um, you probably
have other plans already,

446
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,290
but, um, can I take you
to a drink tonight?

447
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,031
I don't know anyone
in this darn town,

448
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:34,076
and I'd love to treat you
to a cocktail if you're game.

449
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:35,774
- Okay.
- Okay?

450
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,123
- I've twisted your arm?

451
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:40,517
So, uh, who makes
the best martini in town?

452
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,432
- Maybe O'Hara's?
- O'Hara's.

453
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,825
It's actually
the only bar in town.

454
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,087
No, O'Hara's is good.

455
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,568
See you at 7:00?

456
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,352
With bells on?
Is that the expression?

00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:51,518
Hi.

482
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:52,736
Please, please, please, sit.

483
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,608
Um, what are you having?

484
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:58,046
Uh, I'll have a beer, I guess.

485
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,613
A beer? Oh.

486
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,919
Hi, Eileen.

487
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,007
Good to see you, hon.

488
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,139
What's next, sweetheart?

489
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,576
Um, well... Oh, my stars.

490
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,274
You're absolutely frozen.

491
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,580
Um, one beer, please,
and maybe a little whiskey

492
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,018
to warm up my girl.
What say, huh?

493
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,717
My, you look very glamorous.

494
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:17,936
It's just an old dress.

495
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,067
May I?

496
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,816
How about you,
sweetheart? Another martini?

497
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,252
Love one. Thank you.

498
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:32,820
Maybe let's hold the olives
this time.

499
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,778
I thought I'd have
a hard time finding this place,

500
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,432
but here it is.

501
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,526
You feeling all right?

502
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,791
Yeah, I'm fine.

503
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,445
Uh, there's something wrong
with my car,

504
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,404
so I have to drive
with the windows down,

505
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,232
or else it fills with smoke.

506
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:54,581
- Oh, you're kidding.

507
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,322
That sounds absolutely awful.

508
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:59,194
Can't you get your husband
to fix that for you?

509
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:01,327
Oh, no, I'm not married.

510
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:03,198
I've always been single.

511
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:04,852
And when I do
have a guy around,

512
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,897
it's just for fun,
and it's brief.

513
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:10,205
No, I never stay anywhere
long with anything.

514
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:12,425
Sort of my modus vivendi

515
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:16,385
or my pathology, depending on
who I'm talking to.

516
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:21,260
How long have you
worked at Moorehead?

517
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,001
Three or four years.

518
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,787
Uh, it was only
supposed to be temporary,

519
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:31,009
while I moved back for a bit
while my mother was sick,

520
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,402
and then she died, so...

521
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:36,318
I've been at the prison,
and time's just flown by.

522
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:37,798
Oh, God.

523
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:40,061
Prison is no place
for time to fly by.

524
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,411
And your mother dying.

525
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,068
That's a lot for a young lady.

526
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:50,680
Ah. 24.

527
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,770
Then you must be eager
to get back out there. Are you?

528
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:59,863
You know, um,
I'm an orphan, too.

529
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:01,648
My uncle raised me out West.

530
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:04,303
Where the sun shines.

531
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,087
I don't understand
how you all do it here,

532
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,697
winter after winter.

533
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:10,178
It's positively creepy.
I don't know.

534
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:12,441
I'm in a sort of strange
love affair with New England.

535
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:14,661
I love it, but I also hate it.

536
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,534
Things feel very real here,
don't they?

537
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,711
Sort of there's no...

538
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,192
...imagination.

539
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,934
There's no sentimentality
or fantasy.

540
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:30,198
There's... there's just
nowhere to hide.

541
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:36,335
Sorry.

542
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,250
I've had too much to drink.

543
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,469
I tend to talk when I've had
too much to drink.

544
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,862
It's all right.

545
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:43,255
Mm, it's better
than talking too little.

546
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,867
Did you see Lee Polk today?

547
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:50,436
Uh...

548
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,002
Did she say anything to you?

549
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,874
Mrs. Polk?

550
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:57,138
She was just upset.

551
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:59,619
Those mothers are always upset.

552
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,925
Mm-hmm.

553
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,363
Did she seem
like an angry woman to you?

554
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:07,844
I don't know. Uh...

555
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,324
everyone's kind of angry here.

556
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,934
- It's Massachusetts.
- Mm.

557
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,330
Well, I had this professor
at Harvard.

558
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,333
He was brilliant,
but very difficult.

559
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:22,598
Uh, he did this--
these experiments on prisoners

560
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,818
studying the effects
of psychedelics on recidivism.

561
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,080
Now, I don't agree
with his methods,

562
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,342
there is no magic pill,

563
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:30,998
but... but you can
set people free...

564
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:36,525
...if you can get them to tell
the truth, to feel it.

565
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,223
That's what I want to do.

566
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:41,356
Secrets and lies.

567
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,576
I tell you, doll...

568
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:47,275
...some families are so sick,
so twisted,

569
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,972
the only way out's
for someone to die.

570
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,539
Don't you think?

571
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:53,847
Hey! What'd you say
your name was?

572
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:55,805
Who, me?

573
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,807
Ah, yeah. W-We was just saying

574
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,287
that you look so familiar.

575
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,115
Are you in the movies
or something?

576
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,769
Hardly. I work
at the boys' prison.

577
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:03,900
- Ah.
- I'm Eileen,

578
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,075
and this is my friend, Rebecca.

579
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,686
She's a psychologist.

580
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:08,949
Don't be shy, Rebecca.

581
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,124
These boys won't bite.

582
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:13,693
Not unless you ask us to.

583
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,434
This is Jerry.
You can ignore him.

584
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:17,479
He's married.

585
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,959
What happened
to your teeth, Jerry?

586
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,830
You get into a fight
with your old lady?

587
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,789
That's it. His wife's
got a left like Joe Frazier.

588
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,139
Nah, nah.
He... he slipped on the ice.

589
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,662
I'm gonna grow
some new ones, though.

590
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:28,229
Mm-hmm.

591
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,796
Just need a few more of these.

592
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,885
Cheers to that.
To Jerry and his new teeth.

593
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:33,408

00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,280
You have a strange face.

640
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,370
It's plain, but...

641
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,937
...fascinating.

642
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,983
It has a beautiful...

643
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,247
...turbulence.

644
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:41,988

I bet you have
brilliant dreams.

646
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:52,041
I bet you dream
of other worlds.

647
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:57,177
Maybe you'll dream of me
and my morning remorse,

648
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,397
which is certain.

649
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,660
I shouldn't drink,

650
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,966
- but I do.

651
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,189
Thank you.

652
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:55,931
Hey, Sandy, can I get a martini
and some matches?

653
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:04,374
Better be careful, Eileen.

654
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:06,028
I don't want any trouble
with your dad.

655
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,379
My dad's not gonna cause
any trouble.

656
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:34,595
Dad. Dad.

657
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,423
Dad, can you let me in?

658
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,078
Shit.

659
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:02,580
Hey, Dad!

660
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,930
Can I have the keys?

661
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,019
Can I please have the keys?

662
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,630
- No, you may not have the keys.

663
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,501
Not until you read that book
from cover to cover.

664
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:13,591
I want to hear every word.

665
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,599
Where'd you put the keys?

666
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,907
Make yourself comfortable, Eileen.

667
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,780
You're not going anywhere
till you read the last word.

668
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,086
Dad, this is ridiculous.
I need to go to work.

669
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,306
Out all night.

670
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:34,742
Nearly crashed the car.

671
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:37,005
Sleeping in your own sick,

672
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:39,138
and now you're worried
about getting to work on time?

673
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:41,096
I can hardly look at you,
I'm so ashamed.

674
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:45,797
Oliver Twist would be grateful
for this home,

675
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:47,668
but you, Eileen,

676
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,191
you're trash, Eileen,
just trash.

677
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:51,672
All I did was go out
with a girl from work.

678
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:53,021
You went out
with a girl from work?

679
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:54,457
Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

680
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:56,155
Who is he? Huh?

681
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:58,331
Who is this boy?
I just want to know who he is

682
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:00,289
before you get knocked up
and sell your soul to Satan.

683
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:02,727
Can you just give me the keys?!

684
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:04,424
Please! I'll be late!

685
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:06,513
You're not going anywhere
dressed like that.

686
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,863
I mean, really, Eileen,
how dare you?

687
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:11,692
That's the dress your mother
wore to my father's funeral.

688
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,868
You got no respect for anyone.

689
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:15,348
Get changed.

690
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:17,785
I don't want anyone
seeing you in that getup.

691
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:19,265
They'll think I'm dead.

692
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,316
Ah. Miss Dunlop?

693
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:29,797
May I, um, may I have a word?

694
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:32,147
Oh, Jesus.

695
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:33,671
It's about your father.

696
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,847
Him? Go talk to him.
He's inside.

697
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,196
It's about his gun.

698
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:38,458
This oughta be good.

699
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,634
Pray tell, Buck.

700
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:42,027
Uh, yesterday,

701
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:44,029
we got several complaints
from neighbors,

702
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:45,726
from Miss Connie
down at the school,

703
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,902
that, uh, Chief Dunlop

704
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:51,558
was sitting
in that north-facing window

705
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:54,126
and, uh, pointing his weapon

706
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:55,605
at children walking home
from school.

707
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,914
He has agreed to relinquish
the property into your care.

708
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:02,264
As long as you promise
not to use it on him.

709
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:03,701
His words.

710
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:05,746
May I come in?

711
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:10,055
Want to hang it on me
like an ornament?

712
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:11,317
Aw.

713
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:13,188
I'm sure that Miss Dunlop

714
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:15,321
will take excellent care
of the weapon, sir.

715
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:18,672
As she does with all things,
Buck, as you can see.

716
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:34,557
- ♪ It's Christmastime

00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:43,392

724
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,405
Let me know which ones.

725
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,972
Sure. I'll hold.

726
00:45:57,972 --> 00:45:59,713
Ah, look what
the cat dragged in.

727
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:01,062
- Good afternoon, Eileen.

728
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:03,238
You look fresh as a daisy,
as always.

729
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:04,500
I had car trouble.

730
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,937
Yeah, I believe
the trouble part.

731
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:08,287
It's almost Christmas.
Can you give me a break?

732
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,245
No. Get to work.

733
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:12,595
Okay. I need the Polk file.

734
00:46:12,595 --> 00:46:14,119
- Yeah.

735
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,164
I think Dr. St. John has it.

736
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,645
Perfect.
Yeah, I'm afraid that one

737
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:20,690
will have to wait
till after the holidays.

738
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,344
We have a new doctor on staff,

739
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:24,825
and, uh, apparently she
doesn't follow procedures.

740
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:26,827
- She's not in today?
- Been and gone.

741
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,089
She's gonna be back
after Christmas.

742
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:29,177
Yeah. Will do.

743
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:30,788
All right, then. Thank you.

744
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,093
Bye-bye.

745
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:41,320
Where do you think
you're going?

746
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,800
The infirmary.

747
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,410
I think something's
going around.

748
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,107
You look like
you've been going around.

749
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,631
She's a boozer.

750
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:40,978
Dad?

751
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:54,513
Dad?

752
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:07,743
Dad?

753
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,006
- Dad, can you hear me?

754
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,572
Dad, can you hear me?

755
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,357
- What were you doing up there?
- I need my gun.

756
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:13,445
- Sit up.
- It's after me.

757
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:14,446
Nobody's after you.

758
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:16,100
Sit up. Sit up.

759
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:26,893
Joanie.

760
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:28,677
That you, Joanie?

761
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:31,941
Hey.

762
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:34,553
Joanie. Joanie.

763
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:36,163
Joanie.

764
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:37,860
Dad.

765
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,081
Quit your fussing, Joanie.

766
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,485
DOCTOR [voice-over]:
We stitched him up,

767
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:55,095
and I don't think
he has a concussion,

768
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,575
but his blood alcohol level

769
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:58,229
is point one-seven.

770
00:50:58,229 --> 00:51:00,318
His liver's enlarged,
and he's covered in bruises.

771
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:01,754
I'm not blaming you, honey,
but, uh...

772
00:51:01,754 --> 00:51:03,147
Yeah, sure.

773
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:04,887
Hey, who's letting him
live like this?

774
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:07,194
I don't know. My mom died,
and he doesn't have a job.

775
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,848
What else is he supposed to do?

776
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:10,502
Yeah, there are men
who don't drink all day.

777
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:12,330
I know that.

778
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:16,073
Look, I know this
is hard for you, but, uh...

779
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,379
if he stops drinking,
he might die,

780
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:21,121
but if he keeps drinking,
it'll definitely kill him.

781
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:23,123
I don't know what else
to say to you.

782
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:32,306
Sit down, Dad.

783
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,535
The doctor told me
you're gonna die.

784
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:45,232
Oh, like he's not?

785
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:48,322
He said, if you
keep drinking like this,

786
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,584
it'll kill you.

787
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:51,238
Screw him.

788
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:52,674
You know they killed
your mother at that hospital.

789
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,459
They owe me more than stitches.

790
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:57,026
Can you lean back?

791
00:51:57,026 --> 00:51:58,376
Course I can lean back.

792
00:51:58,376 --> 00:52:00,378
You don't think
I know how to go to bed?

793
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,642
Well, I need a drink.

794
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:04,947
Dad!

795
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:06,601
And anyway,
I do not sleep here.

796
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:08,429
- It's haunted.
- Please, Dad.

797
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:11,650
If I get you a bottle,
will you lie down?

798
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,827
No. I want to have
a drink with my daughter.

799
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:17,743
You're different these days.

800
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,614
You're almost interesting.

801
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,755
What are you doing with all
the money you make at work?

802
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,238
Why don't you ever buy
your own clothes?

803
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:44,509
I remember that coat.

804
00:52:44,509 --> 00:52:46,728
I remember your mother...

805
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:50,167
How does it look on me?

806
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,213
Well, your mother
looked beautiful in that coat.

807
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,128
I bought it for her to wear

808
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:57,478
when she got out
of the bughouse.

809
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:01,830
I always loved your mother.

810
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:04,877
No matter what you
thought it looked like,

811
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,226
I always loved her.

812
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:11,405
And I know
what people say about me.

813
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:14,843
They say I made her crazy
'cause I'm a hard-ass.

814
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:19,108
And I may have yelled
a few times,

815
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:21,807
but she always forgave me.

816
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:26,725
Because we loved each other.

817
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:29,075
Love will make you crazy, Eileen.

818
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,601
You'll probably
never understand that.

819
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,037
Why?

820
00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:39,912
Some people...

821
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:41,696
they're the real people.

822
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:46,440
Like in a movie, they're
the ones you're watching.

823
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,486
They're the ones making moves.

824
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:52,968
And the other people...

825
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,060
...they're just there
filling the space,

826
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,411
and you take 'em for granted.

827
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:02,369
You think, "They're easy."

828
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:06,199
Take a penny, leave a penny.

829
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:12,727
That's you, Eileen.

830
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:15,339
You're one of them.

831
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,409
What are you doing?
You don't gotta lock it.

832
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:44,150
- Let's go.

833
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,499
- Come on. Come on.

834
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,284
Come on. It's cold out here.

835
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,285
Come on. Hurry up.

836
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,417
Open the door.

837
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:55,509
Fucking heavy.

838
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:04,301
Give me my fucking drink.

839
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:32,329
Eileen!

840
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,072
Eileen!

841
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:41,599
What, Dad?

842
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,209
Phone rang.

843
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:44,819
Some woman looking for you.

844
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:46,995
What'd you say?

845
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:48,127
Nothing.

846
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:51,304
I know nothing. I said nothing.

847
00:55:58,311 --> 00:55:59,443
Hello.

848
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:01,401
Hello, Christmas angel.

849
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:04,230
Rebecca?

850
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,667
Look, I was just thinking
of you,

851
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,103
and, well, I-I don't know

852
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:09,540
what you're planning
for Christmas Eve,

853
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,542
but I thought maybe
you'd like to come over.

854
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:12,978
There are some records
we could play,

855
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:15,241
and maybe dance again
if all goes well.

856
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:19,811
Unless you have
a better offer, of course.

857
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:22,161
I don't have a better offer.

858
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:23,902
- So you'll come?
- Yeah.

859
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,817
Let me give you the address.

860
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:27,645
Okay. Hold on.

861
00:56:30,212 --> 00:56:32,650
It's 32 Maple Street.

862
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:35,609
So see you later.

863
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:38,177
- Bye.
- Bye.

Sorry it took me so long.

885
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:12,445
I think that cat's possessed.

886
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:13,533
Merry Christmas.

887
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:16,014
Oh. Aren't you a peach?

888
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:17,537
Come in! Come in.

889
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,322
Eileen, um,

890
00:58:20,322 --> 00:58:22,020
I'm sorry the place
is such a mess.

891
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,457
I-I haven't... I mean,
I tried to clean it up a bit,

892
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:25,850
- but it's just beyond me.

893
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,113
I hope it doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

894
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:29,723
Let's open this wine.

895
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,553
Uh, sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

you are... ♪

897

I hope you didn't have
to drive far. Was it far?

898
00:58:39,994 --> 00:58:41,996
Uh, no.
I drive all over the place.

899
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:43,476
Let me take your coat.

900
00:58:45,304 --> 00:58:46,435
- Thanks.
- Oh, my.

901
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:47,872
It's so nice and soft.

902
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:49,526
It's my mother's.

903
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,572
Well, uh, she must have
been a real classy lady

904
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,835
to have such a classy daughter.

905
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:57,534
She was something
of a clotheshorse, actually.

906
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,275
- I hope it's a kind you like.

907
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:01,886
Oh. I'm sure it's delicious.

908
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:03,757
Drink sounds nice, actually.

909
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:05,542
Let's see where
the corkscrew's hiding.

910
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,456
- Uh, you know,

911
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:10,329
I have just been so busy lately

912
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:12,723
that I can't seem
to remember where the...

913
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:15,552
But it's got to be here
under all this mess, right?

914
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,379
You know what?

915
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:20,339
A very handy young PhD student
once taught me a trick

916
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:23,690
for how to open a bottle
if you're ever stranded

917
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,387
without a corkscrew.

918
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:33,308
Philosophers are always
the biggest drunks.

919
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:37,574
Although he was kind of cute.

920
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:44,624
Eugene Henderson, Harvard.

921
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:46,713
I had no idea
you could do that.

922
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:48,062
That was a great trick.

923
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:49,977
Mm-hmm.

924
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:51,544
Now we need some glasses.

925
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:53,111
Ah.

926
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,724
So to Eileen,
my Christmas savior.

927
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,204
Savior?

928
00:59:59,204 --> 01:00:00,509
I didn't do anything.

929
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,076
Well, you're being a friend.

930
01:00:02,076 --> 01:00:04,078
That's everything. Cheers.

No. That's a...

No.

943
01:00:39,157 --> 01:00:40,593
Oh, uh, sure.

944
01:00:40,593 --> 01:00:42,682
I, uh...
No, I can't have roommates.

945
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:44,815
I, um,
I like my own space.

946
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:46,207
I still like to have fun,

947
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,470
and, uh, I can make
a lot of noise.

948
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,908
And, uh, I can
make a mess, as you can see,

949
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:53,562
but, uh, I can play music
as loud as I want to.

950
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:54,868
I can...

951
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:57,566
I can scream
as loud as I want to.

952
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:04,922
I can't stand roommates, either.

953
01:01:04,922 --> 01:01:06,837
In college,
I had to lock my door...

954
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,795
Oh, that's right.
You were in college.

955
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:09,796
What'd you study?

956
01:01:09,796 --> 01:01:11,493
Just the required courses.

957
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:13,234
Um, if I hadn't left,

958
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:15,802
I probably would have
ended up a secretary anyway.

959
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:17,499
Eileen, you're not
really a secretary.

960
01:01:17,499 --> 01:01:19,197
Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Stevens,
they're secretaries,

961
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:20,720
'cause they do
what they're told,

962
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,462
and that's why they're
miserable and nasty.

963
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:26,334
But you, you got a big life
ahead of you, I'm sure.

964
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,686
Okay. I'm not a real secretary.

965
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,513
No, you're not.

966
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:33,298
- 'Cause you're smart.
- Mm.

967
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:37,650
And you're curious, aren't you?

968
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,261
Mm, I never really did
very good in school,

969
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:42,176
so I'm just kind of average,
I think.

970
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:43,917
Oh, don't say that, Eileen.

971
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,745
- Never say that. Do you...?

972
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:51,620
You really think
you're a normal person?

973
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:54,101
Normal how?

974
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:01,892
I really am a bad hostess.

975
01:02:01,892 --> 01:02:03,284
Maybe we'll, uh...

976
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:05,765
We'll feel better
if we eat something.

977
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:07,636
I feel fine.

978
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:15,514
Can I use your bathroom?

979
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:18,386
Sure.

980
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:19,692

Go on. Go on. Eat. Eat. Yeah.

Have a pickle, too.

998
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,435
Why do we need
a little, uh, cheese knife?

To keep our hands clean?

1000
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,786
No. It's all ridiculous.

1001
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:40,485
Everything is.

1002
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:42,835
All these stupid traditions,

1003
01:04:42,835 --> 01:04:46,404
like the-the warden
and his prison at Christmas.

1004
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:47,927
What do you mean?

1005
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:50,451
I've tried explaining
how things need to change,

1006
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:52,801
but all he cares about

1007
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:54,586
is whether or not the boys
are gonna think about me

1008
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:56,849
while they molest themselves
in their cells at night.

1009
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:58,633
God forbid.

1010
01:04:58,633 --> 01:04:59,983
There's a strict

1011
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,941
no masturbation policy
at Moorehead.

1012
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:04,683
It's illegal
to get off in prison.

1013
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:06,946
You know that, right?

1014
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:08,948
As if that's
the downfall of civilization,

1015
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,819
people having orgasms.

1016
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:14,084
You can't count on men
to fix anything.

1017
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:17,478
People are so ashamed
of their desires,

1018
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:19,089
especially men.

1019
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,966
Eileen...

1020
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:31,188
...as you can
probably tell by now,

1021
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:33,973
I live a little differently
than most people.

1022
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:35,975
No, your house i-is nice.

1023
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:38,151
- No.
- It's cozy.

1024
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:40,588
I don't mean the house.
I mean...

1025
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:43,243
I have my own ideas.

1026
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:48,596
Maybe you and I
share some of those ideas.

1027
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:51,948
What kind of ideas do we share?

1028
01:05:57,562 --> 01:05:59,433
May I confide in you?

1029
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:02,045
Of course.

1030
01:06:04,612 --> 01:06:06,571
It's about Lee Polk.

1031
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,009
- It is?
- Yes.

1032
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:11,532
Tell me, honey...

1033
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:16,146
...what would make a person
want to kill their father?

1034
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:19,323
Everybody wants
to kill their father.

1035
01:06:20,324 --> 01:06:21,890
No, they don't.
Who told you that?

1036
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:24,632
Really, think about it, Eileen.

1037
01:06:24,632 --> 01:06:27,896
Because Lee snuck
into his parents' bedroom

1038
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:29,898
in the middle of the night...

1039
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:32,945
...hacked through
his father's throat

1040
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,512
with an old kitchen knife,

1041
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:37,341
and stabbed him
in the chest repeatedly.

1042
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:41,301
His mother claimed she thought
there'd been a break-in.

1043
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:42,955
How do you sleep
through something like that?

1044
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:44,478
I don't know.

1045
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:46,741
You don't.
That's why I called her in.

1046
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:48,265
I mean, you were there.

1047
01:06:48,265 --> 01:06:49,831
The poor boy
could barely look at her, so...

1048
01:06:49,831 --> 01:06:52,486
so afterwards,
I just asked him point-blank.

1049
01:06:52,486 --> 01:06:53,792
I said...

1050
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,449
I said,
"What'd your father do to you?"

1051
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:03,628
"What made you want to do that
to your father's body?"

1052
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:08,546
And he spilled it all
in a matter of minutes.

1053
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:11,157
Nobody had ever bothered
to ask him before.

1054
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:14,682
No one had thought to ask.

1055
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:15,683
Wouldn't you want to know?

1056
01:07:15,683 --> 01:07:17,729
Wouldn't you be curious?

1057
01:07:17,729 --> 01:07:19,252
Yes.

1058
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:27,086
Do you want to know?

1059
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,133
Yes.

1060
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,788
Eileen, you can never
tell anyone. Do you understand?

1061
01:07:33,788 --> 01:07:35,051
You understa... Promise me.

1062
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,226
Promise.

1063
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:42,101
♪ What happened
to the love... ♪

1064
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:44,669
The first thing
you need to know,

1065
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:46,105
this isn't my house.

1066
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,367
This is the Polk house.

1067
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,543
I have Mrs. Polk
tied up downstairs.

1068
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,383
Eileen. Eileen.

1069
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:06,473
Eileen.

1070
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:07,866
Eileen, please wait.

1071
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:09,128
Eileen, please.

1072
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,912
I thought I could
do this alone, Eileen.

1073
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:13,089
- Please don't go. Eileen!

1074
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,134
Please, don't go. Please.

1075
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:18,006
I thought you invited me
over here 'cause you liked me.

1076
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,878
Oh, I do.

1077
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:22,620
I do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please, Eileen.

1078
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,230
Just pl-please, Eileen.
Just give me a moment.

1079
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,710
Please just let me explain.

1080
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,277
I need...

1081
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:28,669
I need a friend.

1082
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,548
I came here yesterday afternoon

1083
01:08:37,548 --> 01:08:39,158
to talk to Mrs. Polk.

1084
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:41,682
I said I could see
that she was upset

1085
01:08:41,682 --> 01:08:43,162
after our meeting with Lee,

1086
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:45,164
was there anything
she wanted to discuss.

1087
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:48,428
She said, "Nothing," so I...

1088
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:50,082
I pressed her.

1089
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,173
I told her
what Lee had told me.

1090
01:08:55,348 --> 01:08:58,264
She spat at me,
called me the pervert,

1091
01:08:58,264 --> 01:08:59,961
then called her husband
a saint,

1092
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:03,748
and I left my card,
told her to think about it.

1093
01:09:03,748 --> 01:09:06,446
I knew she wouldn't call.
Then I left.

1094
01:09:09,232 --> 01:09:11,582
Now, I couldn't sleep
last night.

1095
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:14,150
'Cause I...

1096
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,804
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Lee had told me,

1097
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:18,328
what his father had done,

1098
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:21,200
and how his mother
had let it happen.

1099
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,029
I don't even remember the drive
over here, I was so angry.

1100
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:26,771
Suddenly I was
pushing past her,

1101
01:09:26,771 --> 01:09:28,294
saying, "How could you do it?

1102
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,209
How could you be complicit
in such torture?"

1103
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:32,080
And she snapped.

1104
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,474
She attacked me. See?

1105
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,172
See?

1106
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,782
So I defended myself.

1107
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:39,958
We fought, and I...
I don't know what happened,

1108
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,352
but somehow we fell down
the stairs to the basement.

1109
01:09:42,352 --> 01:09:44,919
I-I thought she
was gonna kill me,

1110
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:48,184
so I hit her with a chair
and tied her up.

1111
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:51,709
I tried to talk
to her rationally,

1112
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:54,364
to explain that I was here
to help Lee,

1113
01:09:54,364 --> 01:09:57,845
that-that I could help her,
too, if she'd let me,

1114
01:09:57,845 --> 01:10:00,196
but... but she just
kept screaming

1115
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,459
that-that I'd kidnapped her
and her husband was a cop

1116
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:04,025
and I was gonna go to jail.

1117
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:09,117
So I found some codeine
in a bathroom,

1118
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:10,771
and got her to be quiet.

1119
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,686
Then I called you.

1120
01:10:13,905 --> 01:10:16,603
Because, as you can see,
I'm in a bit of a pinch.

1121
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:19,911
What can I do?

1122
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,261
I need Mrs. Polk to confess,

1123
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:25,395
and I need a witness,
two against one.

1124
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:27,223
You understand?

1125
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:32,489
Oh, I can't go to jail.

1126
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:43,021
Okay.

1127
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:50,550
Okay.

1128
01:11:03,476 --> 01:11:04,695
Wait here.

1129
01:11:04,695 --> 01:11:06,653
Eileen. Wait...

1130
01:11:31,243 --> 01:11:33,463
It's incredible.

1131
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:34,942
Why do you have that?

1132
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:36,204
Why did you bring that
around here?

1133
01:11:36,204 --> 01:11:37,554
My dad's sick.

1134
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:41,427
Pick it up, and show me
how you're gonna hold it.

1135
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:49,479
That's very good, Eileen.

1136
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:55,006
All right.

1137
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:07,627
Be cool.

1138
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,312
Just tell us the truth,
Mrs. Polk,

1139
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:41,705
and we'll let you go free.

1140
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:51,628
Families can heal.

1141
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:53,804
You're not a lost cause.
No one is.

1142
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:55,153
It can't have been easy,

1143
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:57,764
being married
to a man like that.

1144
01:12:57,764 --> 01:13:00,158
You're obviously
having a hard time.

1145
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:06,469
Why don't you tell us
what happened in this house,

1146
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:08,732
why you helped your husband
do what he did?

1147
01:13:08,732 --> 01:13:11,604
And then we'll be even,

1148
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:15,782
and we can
all walk out of here, and...

1149
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:18,481
and we can figure out
how to help Lee.

1150
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:30,667
Fucking untie me! Untie me!

1151
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,146
Let me out of here!

1152
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:35,106
You crazy bitch,
get out of my house!

1153
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:36,586
You're in big trouble,
you think you're gonna

1154
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:37,848
- get away with this!
- Eileen.

1155
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:40,894
You're going to jail
for a long time.

1156
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:43,201
What the hell
is she doing here?!

1157
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:44,768
What are you doing here?

1158
01:13:44,768 --> 01:13:46,813
I really think you need
to tell us the truth.

1159
01:13:46,813 --> 01:13:48,598
What the hell
are you talking about?!

1160
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:50,034
- If you don't...

1161
01:13:50,034 --> 01:13:51,905
we could leave you
down here tied up,

1162
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:53,124
no one to find you.

1163
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:54,647
The human body
can't live very long

1164
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:56,344
without food and water.

1165
01:13:56,344 --> 01:13:58,608
Sooner or later, you're
gonna need to take a shit.

1166
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:01,959
I guess you're just gonna
have to shit yourself.

1167
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:03,874
And piss.

1168
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:05,441
It's not gonna feel very good.

1169
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,747
I'm not scared of you.

1170
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:09,749
I know you.

1171
01:14:09,749 --> 01:14:11,359
I know who your dad is.

1172
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:13,579
If you know my dad,
then you oughta be scared.

1173
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:16,843
Yeah? Scared of a womanizing,
drunk piece of shit

1174
01:14:16,843 --> 01:14:19,019
who everybody knows
is batshit crazy?

1175
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:20,543
You think he didn't have
problems of his own?

1176
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,414
You think he didn't have
secrets of his own, huh?

1177
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:24,155
You think your mom
didn't know about 'em?

1178
01:14:24,155 --> 01:14:25,069
Think it didn't...

1179
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:27,854
I am going to fucking kill you

1180
01:14:27,854 --> 01:14:31,467
if you don't start talking
right now!

1181
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,992
Please!

1182
01:14:34,992 --> 01:14:37,168
Please, don't kill me.

1183
01:14:37,168 --> 01:14:40,650
I won't have to kill you
if you talk.

1184
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:56,840
I can't.

1185
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:00,365
No, please.

1186
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:02,541
She's not gonna help you. Talk.

1187
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,543
I can't help you
unless you confess.

1188
01:15:26,478 --> 01:15:27,653
All right.

1189
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:32,789
You win.

1190
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,230
When you get married

1191
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:41,145
and you have children...

1192
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:55,681
You take an oath
when you get married

1193
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:59,119
to honor and obey your husband.

1194
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:01,339
You wouldn't understand that.

1195
01:16:02,906 --> 01:16:04,908
At first, I...

1196
01:16:04,908 --> 01:16:06,997
At first, I just,
I thought Mitch

1197
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:09,826
was just checking on him
in his sleep,

1198
01:16:09,826 --> 01:16:11,567
you know,
like any father would,

1199
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,873
like he, he just wanted
to be sure

1200
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:16,572
his son was safe and sound
in bed.

1201
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:19,705
Sometimes I'd...

1202
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,621
...feel him getting out of bed,

1203
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:26,320
and sometimes I'd just
feel him when he'd come back.

1204
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:30,411
And he'd...

1205
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:33,023
kiss me or...

1206
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:35,547
hold me and...

1207
01:16:37,027 --> 01:16:38,419
You know?

1208
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,770
And we hadn't
really been together

1209
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,293
since Lee'd been born.

1210
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:48,995
But then I...

1211
01:16:48,995 --> 01:16:53,043
I started getting
these infections down there.

1212
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,439
I figured it was my fault.

1213
01:16:59,876 --> 01:17:01,442
And then I wondered if Mitch

1214
01:17:01,442 --> 01:17:03,706
had brought something home
with him, you know?

1215
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,672
Then one time...

1216
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:16,675
I got up
in the middle of the night.

1217
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:21,549
I don't remember why.

1218
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:24,074
Glass of water? I don't know.

1219
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,821
I thought-I thought
maybe it was a dream.

1220
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,474
I...

1221
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:38,566
I went-I went and looked in.

1222
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,705
It didn't dawn on me
right away.

1223
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:49,447
You know,
I-I swear to you. I...

1224
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:51,057
I mean...

1225
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:57,411
You don't expect your husband's

1226
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:00,066
gonna do something like that,
you know?

1227
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:02,678
I mean, nobody
would believe it, anyway.

1228
01:18:05,463 --> 01:18:07,073
And then I... and then...

1229
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:10,381
And then I figured...

1230
01:18:10,381 --> 01:18:12,383
And then I figured,
if Lee was clean...

1231
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,480
If he was clean,

1232
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,657
an enema
and a bath before bed...

1233
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:30,706
...then it would be better
for all of us.

1234
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,621
And it was.

1235
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:38,975
I knew what I was doing,
it wasn't...

1236
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:40,498
it wasn't quite right.

1237
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:42,892
I did know that. I did.

1238
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:46,591
But who do you tell? You know?

1239
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:48,506
Who could I tell?

1240
01:18:52,118 --> 01:18:54,512
I mean,
you do the best you can.

1241
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,865
You know what happens
when you have children?

1242
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:04,000
Your husband
never looks at you the same.

1243
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,484
But after he went to bed
with Lee,

1244
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:12,399
he'd come to me.

1245
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,363
It was like a big burden
had been lifted.

1246
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:21,495
He was, he was relaxed.

1247
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:26,849
It felt good, how he'd hold me.

1248
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:29,765
He loved me then.

1249
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,857
He would whisper and kiss me.

1250
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:39,470
It was the way
it had been before...

1251
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:44,040
...when we were young
and happy and in love.

1252
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:48,348
It felt good.

1253
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:53,179
Is that so wrong...

1254
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,095
...to want to feel like that?

1255
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:02,493
You wouldn't understand.

1256
01:20:04,712 --> 01:20:07,150
You're young, you haven't
had your heart broken.

1257
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:16,202
I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding!

1258
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:17,856
Help me! Help me!

1259
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:19,684
Please! Plea... Help me!

1260
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:21,599
-  I'm bleeding!
- Shh! Shh!

1261
01:20:21,599 --> 01:20:23,209
- Help me! You'll be sorry!
- Eileen, help me!

1262
01:20:23,209 --> 01:20:25,603
I'll tell everyone
what you've done!

1263
01:20:25,603 --> 01:20:27,605
- Eileen!
- A doctor!

1264
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:29,172
Get a doctor!

1265
01:20:29,172 --> 01:20:32,305
- Get me out of here!
- Eileen, help me!

1266
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:34,960
Help me!

1267
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,876
No! No!

1268
01:20:45,188 --> 01:20:46,450
No.

1269
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:48,147
No! No!

1270
01:20:48,147 --> 01:20:49,670
No! No!

1271
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:52,630
Okay. Okay.

1272
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:52,559
Why did you shoot her?

1273
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:55,432
I was upset.

1274
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:00,872
What do we do now?

1275
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,016
We take her to my house.

1276
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,284
My dad's always
whipping his gun out.

1277
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:22,938
Everyone knows it.

1278
01:22:24,243 --> 01:22:28,334
We can make it look like
he shot her in a blackout.

1279
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:34,253
He's just a drunk
piece of shit, right?

1280
01:22:34,253 --> 01:22:36,952
He's gonna die anyway
or go crazy.

1281
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,041
The doctor said so.

1282
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:41,173
So let's take her together
and leave.

1283
01:22:41,173 --> 01:22:44,916
Then we could go to New York
for the New Year...

1284
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:47,397
...just the two of us.

1285
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,663
I love you.

1286
01:22:55,796 --> 01:22:57,494
It's okay.

1287
01:22:59,887 --> 01:23:01,498
Come on.

1288
01:23:02,455 --> 01:23:03,891
All right.

1289
01:23:15,773 --> 01:23:17,122
You go ahead
to your father's house.

1290
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:18,341
Wait for me there.

1291
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:19,777
- Yeah.
- I'll clean up inside.

1292
01:23:19,777 --> 01:23:21,039
We can't leave
any evidence behind.

1293
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:22,127
- I'll be waiting.
- I'll be quick.

1294
01:27:17,884 --> 01:27:19,886
Eileen.

1295
01:27:24,674 --> 01:27:26,284
Eileen.

1296
01:27:29,026 --> 01:27:31,420
Go back to sleep, Dad.

1297
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:35,075
Where you going?

1298
01:28:07,064 --> 01:28:09,545
I might just get on the road.

1299
01:28:13,592 --> 01:28:15,290
All right, then.

1300
01:28:18,684 --> 01:28:20,295
Good night.
