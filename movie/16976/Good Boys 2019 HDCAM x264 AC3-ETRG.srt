169
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:26,999
Sippy cup, sing us a song.

170
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:27,898
No.

171
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,076
How about,

172
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,070
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bitch?

173
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,233
Sippy cup!

174
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Sippy cup!

175
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,236
You know guys, he'll do it but,

176
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,269
he just needs more
time to think.

177
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:39,011
Sippy cup! Sippy cup!

178
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:43,081
Bye.

179
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,246
Lasagna <i>and</i> soda?

180
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:50,636
Don't tell my parents
you gave me these.

181
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,558
We're getting a divorce.

182
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:00,222
What do you mean?

183
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,854
I'm tellin' you, everything's
gonna stay the same.

184
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:02,878
We promise.

185
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,566
Will we still watch
This Is Us together?

186
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,660
Yes, of course,
that's our favorite show.

187
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:08,972
That's a family show.

188
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,675
Except now you gonna see it on
two-two different TVs.

189
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:12,892
In two different houses.

190
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,645
So you gonna have to
watch an episode twice.

191
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:16,864
What about Taco Tuesday?

192
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:18,386
Taco Tuesday still goin' down,

193
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:21,269
matter of fact, you gonna have
two Taco Tuesdays, just

194
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,878
one on Wednesday now.

195
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,316
Twice the fun.

196
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:25,708
Twice the fun, twice the tacos.

197
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,872
Everything's gonna
stay the same, so.

198
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:31,294
Me and your mom,
we still best friends, right?

199
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,514
I mean, would be nice
to have tacos together

201
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:39,273
as a family, just have it
change to Wednesday...

00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,591
What are we walkin' on?

220
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:16,544
Walking on...

221
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:17,880

224

What's wrong?

225
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:25,919
This song always makes me sad.

226
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,107
Don't forget.

227
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,412
Rock of Ages auditions
are tomorrow.

228
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:30,810
It's my favorite musical.

229
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,473
I did make some pretty
big changes though

230
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,412
based on my time in Holly-weird.

231
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:36,942
I think it'll really inspire

232
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,966
those of you who dare to dream.

233
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,373
Sick!

234
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,841
So I looked at her, but she was
looking in the other direction.

235
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:46,396
Then she looked at me,

236
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:48,146
I was looking in
the other direction.

237
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:50,291
So, I think that someday
we're gonna make eye contact.

238
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:51,575
That's cool.

239
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:54,029
This musical is gonna be lit.

240
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:56,068
Hey, Soren, look at this.

241
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,802
Sippy cup is signing
up for the musical.

242
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:02,909
Singing is for tryhards.

243
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:06,835
No! Uh, someone signed
me up as a joke.

244
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,914
I was just crossing it off, see?

245
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,172
Yeah, whatever, bitch tits.

246
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,297
Enough.

247
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:13,649
Let's go.

248
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:15,328
I have places to be.

249
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,516
Sorry, Soren.

250
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,749
Don't listen to Atticus.

251
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,766
His dad doesn't even pay taxes.

252
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,649
It doesn't matter what Atticus says.

253
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:24,524
I've been thinking
about quitting singing

254
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:25,985
ever since I was young.

255
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,167
Come on,
we're gonna miss fish sticks.

256
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:40,558
Whoa!

257
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,566
That's the best
lunch I've ever seen.

258
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:45,480
Yeah, my parents are being
super nice because...

259
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:47,339
because...

260
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:49,136
they're great.

261
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,081
They're great and
everything's good.

262
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,816
Ooh, wait, is that a new earring?

263
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,386
Yes! Finally!
Thank you for noticing.

264
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,564
It looks cute on you.

265
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,808
Max, I'm not going for cute,
I'm going for sexy and hot.

266
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,855
Those are the only two
things I'm looking for.

267
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,433
You like it?

268
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,058
It looks infected.

269
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:14,464
Soren's so cool.

270
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:17,245
I heard he beat up Derek Bachman
and blowjobbed his sister.

271
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,074
He blowjobbed his own sister?

272
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:20,948
No, he blowjobbed Derek's sister.

273
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:23,933
Fucking legend.

274
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:34,072
I think Soren's calling me.

Sup.

282
00:12:46,742 --> 00:12:48,836
I heard you sipped a beer
like a fucking champ.

283
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,225
Yeah, I took a pretty
big sip, actually.

284
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,365
Cool.

285
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm having a party
tomorrow night.

286
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:55,983
All these fools are comin'.

287
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,854
You in?

288
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,971
You should come.

289
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:01,494
Trust me.

290
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,025
Yeah, I'll come,

291
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,103
but, you know,
have to ask my mom.

292
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,486
Also, gonna be a kissing party.

293
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:17,276
You French kissed
girls before, right?

294
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,384
Yeah.

295
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,408
Of course.

296
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:21,618
Where?

297
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:27,088
Their mouths?

298
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:28,676
Yeah, dawg.

299
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:33,442
He's not about to start sitting
with the popular kids, is he?

300
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:36,882
No. If anyone should be
over there, it's me.

301
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,835
We heard kids were
calling you "sippy cup".

302
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,496
And we just wanted to let
you know you can always call

303
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,991
the Student Coalition Against
Bullying for protection.

304
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:47,436
Does this look like a sippy cup?

305
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,429
No.

306
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:49,936
It's a fucking juice box.

307
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,108
'Cause I'm not a fucking child.

308
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,608
So rude.

309
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:56,327
Like, can I bring Thor and Lucas?

310
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,069
So random.

311
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,350
No, they're cool.

312
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,554
Trying to keep it
half girls, half guys.

313
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:05,632
You feel me, dawg?

314
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:07,780
I feel you, dawg, but

315
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,999
they're my best friends.
We do everything together.

316
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:11,405
We're the Bean Bag Boys.

317
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,132
That's a dope ass name.

318
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:16,780
Fuck it. Bring 'em.

319
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:18,889
I'd have 'em roll
with my squad, too.

320
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,733
Let me know what
your mom says, dawg.

321
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:22,733
Okay. Bye dawg. Bye dawgs.

322
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:26,840
So?

323
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,684
Soren just invited
us to his party.

324
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,628
- Soren?
- Yeah.

325
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:32,863
He said my name?
He said Thor?

326
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:34,543
Pretty much.

327
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:35,863
Sweet.

328
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:37,363
Oh, there's also
gonna be girls there.

329
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,582
You know what that means?

330
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,895
Drama.

331
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,434
Kissing.

332
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:45,504
So...

333
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,395
do you guys know how to kiss?

334
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,629
- I have no... No. No.
- No.

335
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,629
Type "kissing".

336
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,285
No, no, "boobs".

337
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,074
"Breast cancer research."

338
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,855
"How to find a bra that fits."

339
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:04,332
I have an idea.

340
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,087
"Are you 18 or older?"

341
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:15,845
I'm gonna click yes.

342
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:17,329
We're not 18 or older.

343
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:19,391
This is gonna go on
our permanent record.

344
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,402
<i>I'm your stepmother.</i>

345
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,604
<i>You are not supposed to be
looking at me in the shower.</i>

346
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:26,456
<i>Don't tell my dad, it could
make things worse for me</i>

347
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,558
<i>Get up!</i>

348
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:28,885
<i>Get up.</i>

349
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,988
He's in trouble.

350
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:31,930
<i>You deserve punishment.</i>

351
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:33,203
<i>Pull down your shorts.</i>

352
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:36,243
Is that what happens
when you get a stepmom?

353
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,063
Ewww!

354
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,016
Ugh.

355
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,094
No way that's
gonna fit in there.

356
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,328
Get out of there, girl!

357
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:43,648
Where did his hand go?

358
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:44,867
Oh, my God!

359
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,468
Nobody even kissed.

360
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:54,031
Yeah, not in their mouths...
at least.

361
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,333
My parents have a CPR doll.

362
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:57,951
We can go practice
kissing on that.

363
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,005
Come on.

364
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:08,582
This is a really pretty CPR doll.

365
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,308
I guess I'll go first.

366
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:17,566
Stop!

367
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,972
What are you doing?

368
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,207
Kissing her?

369
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,394
You can't kiss someone
without their permission.

370
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:24,027
Remember from Assembly?

371
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:25,426
Pretend it's Brixlee.

372
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:26,605
Try to be a gentleman.

373
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:27,629
Okay.

374
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:29,238
Brixlee, can I kiss you?

375
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,207
Why?

376
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,566
Why?

377
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,254
Yeah. What do you like about me?

378
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:36,933
Well...

379
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:38,785
you're sweet,

380
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:40,004
you smell good,

381
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,535
you're smart, too.

382
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,723
You always push Henry
in his wheelchair

383
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:44,339
even though he's super mean.

384
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,722
And just when I think
I've got you figured out,

385
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,590
you go ahead and
start skateboarding.

386
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,316
I consent.

387
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:00,276
How was it?

388
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:01,339
Sticky.

389
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,003
Why does she have
hair in her mouth?

390
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,761
You know what, this
isn't teaching us anything.

391
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:10,385
We're missing real
people kissing.

392
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,450
That's the only way to know
if we're doing it right.

393
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,191
My neighbor's a total nymphomaniac.

394
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,996
Her boyfriend's always over.

395
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:18,597
She starts fires?

396
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:20,144
No, that's a pyromaniac.

397
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,862
She's a nymphomaniac.

398
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,581
Someone who has sex
on land <i>and</i> sea.

399
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,675
- Seriously?
- Shh, shh, shh.

400
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:30,047
Okay, I was gonna wait till
tomorrow to surprise you,

401
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:31,220
but can I just tell you?

402
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:32,548
No, we're good.

403
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:34,033
No, you wanna know.

404
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,728
Ugh, I can barely see anything.

405
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,365
I know we haven't
been hanging out much

406
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:39,056
you know, ever since I met Benji,

407
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:40,462
but I wanna make it up to you.

408
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:41,713
So, tomorrow,
I'm skipping school

409
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:42,821
and we're driving to the city

410
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:44,133
to see Kendrick Lamar.

411
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:44,992
Shut up!

412
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:46,227
And we're gonna do Molly.

413
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,323
You thought of everything.

414
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,320
Of course I fucking have,
it's gonna be amazing!

415
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:51,049
Hey, girls!

416
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:54,862
Well, Benji got us the Molly.

417
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:56,330
Benjamin.

418
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:57,612
Thank you.

419
00:17:58,596 --> 00:17:59,596
Look.

420
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,361
This isn't working.

421
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,197
Maybe we could go climb a tree.

422
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:04,564
No, they'd see us.

423
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,611
No, I just meant
let's go climb a tree.

424
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,877
Dude, wait.

425
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,494
I know a way
we can see them kiss.

426
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:19,429
I can't.

427
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:20,876
It has a camera.

428
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,290
We can see everything.
We can learn technique.

429
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,782
It's for his dad's work.
It's not a toy.

430
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,055
Of course it's a toy.

431
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,712
They sell it at toy stores.

432
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,702
My uncle flew a
drone for the army.

433
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:34,782
And now he yells in his sleep
and has crazy diarrhea.

434
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,952
It's messed up that he
even keeps it in the house.

435
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:39,116
You have to walk by it every day.

436
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:40,834
- He's torturing you.
- It's true.

437
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,811
It's like when your cousin walks
around in a bikini and she taunts you.

438
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:45,688
If he finds out,
you'll be grounded.

439
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:47,322
You won't be able
to go to Soren's.

440
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,041
And even worse,
you'll lose your father's trust.

441
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,250
That's true, too.

442
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,994
She'll love you for who you are.

443
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:54,666
Yeah, a shitty kisser.

444
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,954
Remember the porn from earlier?

445
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,095
That guy didn't even
know how to kiss.

446
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,346
He was just licking
that woman's asshole.

447
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,955
You wanna kiss an asshole, Max?

448
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:01,868
Nope.

449
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:03,307
Max, don't listen to him.

450
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:06,299
He just wants to go because
he's obsessed with popular boys.

451
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:07,494
Believe me, Max,

452
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,980
you don't wanna go to Soren's
not knowing how to kiss.

453
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:15,808
Whoo!

454
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,277
So tomorrow,
after you get some girl time,

455
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,621
why don't you come over
for some man time?

456
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,909
No, I told you I'm hanging
out with Lily this weekend.

457
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,425
Yeah, it's just...

458
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,589
you know, it's hard
for me not to see you

459
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:28,113
'cause you're my best friend.

460
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:29,963
But Lily's <i>my</i> best friend.

461
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:32,035
Yeah, totally, totally get it.

462
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:36,660
How about if just hang out
with my ex, Margaret?

463
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:38,691
Are you trying to
make me jealous?

464
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:41,105
Uh, no. Why, are you jealous?

465
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:44,729
Yeah, this isn't working out.

466
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:47,268
I know. You're not hot enough
to be acting like this.

467
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,893
So, the next time
that you're wondering

468
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,511
where all the nice guys went,

469
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:53,524
just remember that you let
one walk right out the door.

470
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:57,799
What?

471
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,243
I didn't say anything.

472
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,572
I never wanna see you again.

473
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:05,984
You okay?

474
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:10,499
Where'd the guy go?

475
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,428
Who cares?
The girls just hugged.

476
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:14,171
They are definitely gonna kiss.

477
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:16,109
Do you mind if we get closer?

478
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,007
What is that?

479
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:22,476
Fucking spying on us.

480
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:24,663
- All right, it's my turn to fly.
- Give it!

481
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,888
- You're gonna buzz 'em.
- No!

482
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:28,747
You're gonna break it.

483
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:30,997
You want it? Fine!

484
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:32,919
Yes!

485
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:37,732
Ha!

486
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:38,794
Aah!

487
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:40,152
No!

488
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:41,177
Shit!

489
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,347
What the hell, Thor?

490
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:43,582
It was both of our faults.

491
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:45,505
My dad's gonna kill me.
What do we do now?

492
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,117
Whoa!

493
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:50,602
We say there was a break-in.

494
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:52,555
They trashed the place
and took the drone.

495
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:55,133
That's the most stupid
fucking idea I've ever heard.

496
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:56,352
Guys, guys!

497
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:59,141
All we have to do is just go
up there and tell the truth.

498
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:00,820
Then God would be on our side.

499
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,594
Hey, can I help you?

500
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:11,000
I hope so, ma'am.

501
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,438
We were using our drone to
follow a family of turtles,

502
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:16,070
and we thought it might've
crashed in your backyard.

503
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:18,110
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here.
Come on in.

504
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:25,546
So you guys like turtles?

505
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,327
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

506
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,538
Time's up, motherfuckers.

507
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,046
Shit, it's a trap!

508
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,874
You think I give a fuck
about turtles?

509
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,030
We're sorry, we just wanted
to learn how to kiss.

510
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:35,693
Lucas, that's none of their business.

511
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:37,296
We should've just told the truth.

512
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:38,835
We're going to a kissing party

513
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,920
and none of us have ever
kissed and we're scared!

514
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:42,545
Goddammit, Lucas.

515
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,179
I've had sex before

516
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,116
but I've never kissed a girl.

517
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:49,107
Just go online and type in
"how to kiss".

518
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:50,491
That's what everyone does.

519
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,600
Oh...

520
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,015
It's very easy.

521
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:55,749
Look, can we please
have our drone back?

522
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:57,396
It's a BD Rolling Thunder.

523
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,897
It's my dad's.
He needs it for work.

524
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:00,062
Can I please have it back?

525
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:01,420
I really need it. Please.

526
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,780
I don't think so.

527
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:05,226
If you don't give it back,
I'll tell my dad you stole it.

528
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,717
Then I'll tell him
that you're a pervert.

529
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:07,858
We'll tell the whole school.

530
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:09,468
This is sensual harassment.

531
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,694
I'll tell everyone that
you're a misogynist.

532
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:13,445
I never massaged anyone.

533
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,655
This is what happens when
you don't respect women.

534
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:20,671
I respect women.
My mom's my best friend.

535
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:22,093
What about me?

536
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,820
I am so fucked.

537
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,491
My dad's gonna kill me.

538
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,350
You had to snoop on them.
You're such a feminist.

539
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:32,288
I'm-I'm not a feminist.
I love women.

540
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:34,701
And my parents are definitely
gonna call your guys' parents.

541
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:35,960
We're all gonna get grounded.

542
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:37,616
Forget Soren's party.
We're fucked.

543
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,080
Why are you smiling?
This is actually your fault.

544
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:42,979
This is leverage.

545
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:48,835
Ho-ho!

546
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,117
Bingo.

547
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,750
What is it?

548
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,109
I have no idea.

549
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,506
That's a tampon.

550
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:55,754
What's it for?

551
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:58,339
Girls shove it up their buttholes
to stop babies from coming out.

552
00:22:58,372 --> 00:22:59,872
And 8th grader told me that.

553
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,600
The human body is truly a mystery.

554
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:07,646
Can't believe they still eat chewables.
Gummies are so much better.

555
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:08,959
I like the chewables.

556
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:10,303
I want one.

557
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:24,303
Fucking childproof bullshit.

558
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:26,897
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

559
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:36,725
It's the girls!

560
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:39,539
Hello?

561
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:42,534
<i>You took my bag,
that has my license, my phone...</i>

562
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,151
Bring it back right now!

563
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:45,573
Fuck that noise.

564
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,901
I want my drone back.

565
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,573
I got this. I got this.

566
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,909
What did you just say,
you little bitch?

567
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:52,987
<i>I'll take a shit
down your throat!</i>

568
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,651
Why are you talking like that?

569
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:58,416
Hannah, I have a little brother.
You're supposed to scare them.

570
00:23:58,651 --> 00:23:59,830
Well, you scared me.

571
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,688
Listen, we were just trying
to teach you a lesson,

572
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:04,633
I promise you, we were
gonna give the drone back.

573
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:07,604
No way!
They could trick us again.

574
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,096
Or overpower us.

575
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,127
Oh, my God.
What if they take the Molly?

576
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:13,643
They won't be able to take it.

577
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:15,901
No, they're children,
they would die.

578
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:19,846
This is Max from earlier.

579
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:22,362
Meet us at the playground
across from John Adams

580
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,588
tomorrow at 7:40 a.m.

581
00:24:24,705 --> 00:24:25,782
Bring the drone.

582
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:28,088
And don't fuck with the
Bean Bag Boys!

583
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:30,420
That was tough.

584
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:31,522
Very tough.

585
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,803
Kinda got a hold on
the toughness first.

586
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:35,014
<i>We're still on the phone.</i>

587
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,030
Shit!

588
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:37,055
Turn it off!

589
00:24:58,808 --> 00:24:59,808
Ow.

590
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:08,608
Don't come any closer!

591
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:10,262
Why?

592
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:11,487
'Cause you could overpower us.

593
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,576
So put the drone on the slide

594
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:17,350
and count back from a hundred
and close your eyes.

595
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:19,225
And don't try anything funny.

596
00:25:19,504 --> 00:25:20,707
There are witnesses.

597
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:23,309
Kid, we have a long
drive ahead of us.

598
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:25,675
So give us the bag
or I will hurt you.

599
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,832
Do not test me.

600
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:28,807
Threats will get you
nowhere, Hanson.

601
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,426
Just give us the fucking Molly!

602
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:34,066
Okay, who's Molly?
'Cause she's not with us.

603
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:37,496
Guys, Molly is a sex drug.

604
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,246
Dateline did an exposé on it.

605
00:25:40,987 --> 00:25:43,892
You had us bring drugs
to a fucking playground?

606
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,659
There are children here!

607
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,185
It's okay. I know what to do.

608
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,638
We're making a citizen's arrest!

609
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:52,943
You're both under arrest.

610
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,301
- Get on the ground.
- Sweet Jesus.

611
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:56,099
- Up, up, up!
- Stay still, hands up!

612
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,394
- Stay still!
- Hands up!

613
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,677
Get down now!

614
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,496
Get down now!

615
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:02,286
Did you just reload
your fake gun?

616
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,549
Are you mocking me?
Are you mocking me?

617
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:07,770
Anything will be used against you
that you say.

618
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:08,677
In court.

619
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,238
You know, you're the one
holding drugs.

620
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:12,490
So, why don't I do
a citizen's arrest on you?

621
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:13,786
Fuck.

622
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:15,607
Time out, crackheads.

623
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,990
Oh, my God.

624
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,535
Deal's off.

625
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,583
We can't let them put
drugs back on the street.

626
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:22,810
Look at those dirty
fucking junkies.

627
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,607
Their lives are already ruined.

628
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:26,565
Let's just give 'em the drugs
and get the drone.

629
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,240
Maybe there's a way we
can protect our community

630
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,615
and get the drone back.

631
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:34,646
Stall them.

632
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:38,240
So, what do you plan to
do with those drugs, huh?

633
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:39,404
Take 'em

634
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:40,529
and feel amazing.

635
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:42,006
They're addicts.

636
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,279
Yeah.

637
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:46,803
So, you've been drugging
your whole life?

638
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:48,928
- Uh-huh.
- Every day.

639
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,303
Uh-huh. Nice.

640
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:51,803
What are you doing? Hey!

641
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:55,913
It's working! Yeah!

642
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:03,128
Gonna make it!

643
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,885
Fuck!

644
00:27:14,086 --> 00:27:16,006
Those girls were lucky
I didn't kick their asses.

645
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,430
Oh, no! They found us.

646
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,563
Oh, shit.

647
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,079
They're on school property.

648
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,344
They don't care,
they're tweaking.

649
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:27,196
You know what we need?

650
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,539
No, don't say it.
Don't say it.

651
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:31,047
SCAB!

652
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:32,337
- Shut up.
- SCAB!

653
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,352
- Zip it.
- SCAB!

654
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,586
What is that?

655
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:37,149
Our lives in danger!

656
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:39,782
SCAB! SCAB, help us!

657
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,696
- We're not scared. We're fine.
- We're okay.

658
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:45,641
Just walking into school.
Average day.

659
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,610
This is crazy.

660
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:47,821
Bullying is crap.

661
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,344
Get on the right track.

662
00:27:49,743 --> 00:27:51,102
Bullying is crap.

663
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,892
When you attack one of us,

664
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,494
you attack all of us.

665
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,048
Your weakness gives us strength.

666
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,640
Well, those kids stole my bag.

667
00:28:14,665 --> 00:28:16,142
Not today, bully!

668
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:17,462
Not today.

669
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,883
- What the fuck?
- Bullying is crap.

670
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,461
Get on the right track.

671
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,226
This is the best day of my life.

672
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:25,798
Get on the right track.

673
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:27,775
Don't worry,
we'll find them later.

674
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:34,142
SCAB just tagged
us on Instagram.

675
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,064
First, sippy cup, and now this?

676
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,923
I'm two weeks into 6th grade
and I'm already a social piranha.

677
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:41,287
Guys, my dad gets back at 5:00.

678
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:43,810
If we don't get a new drone
by then, I'm grounded.

679
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:46,232
Which means we're all grounded,
which means no party,

680
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,677
which means no Brixlee!

681
00:28:47,747 --> 00:28:49,183
Sippy cup for life.

682
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:51,178
No Brixlee, no friends,

683
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,748
no hope, parents fighting,

684
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:56,697
trapped in our rooms, all alone,

685
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:58,557
two Taco Tuesdays.

686
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,307
So, Max, what are we gonna do?

687
00:29:04,948 --> 00:29:06,080
We're gonna ditch school.

688
00:29:06,174 --> 00:29:07,180
Get a new drone.

689
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:09,245
Stop thinking with your
big, old dick, Max.

690
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,932
That could go on our
permanent record.

691
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:13,620
Max's big, old dick is pointing
us in the right direction.

692
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:14,649
Thank you.

693
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,955
If anyone else kisses
Brixlee, I'll die.

694
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:17,902
Wait, what?

695
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:18,941
Here's the plan:

696
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:20,433
I'm gonna bring the
beer to Soren's.

697
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,566
And I'm gonna sip that beer
so everyone will know...

698
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:24,199
That you're an alcoholic.

699
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:25,230
That would be great.

700
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:27,127
Guys, the only place
around here that has one

701
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:28,722
is at North Point Galleria.

702
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:30,090
It's four miles away.

703
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:31,275
Four miles?

704
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,949
How the fuck are we
getting four miles?

705
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:35,003
We have Uber.

706
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:36,902
No, it goes directly
to my mom's phone.

707
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:37,965
She'll know.

708
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:39,572
Then we bike.

709
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:42,222
Where are you even gonna get
the money for a new drone?

710
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,370
What?

711
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:46,534
You know.

712
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:48,996
Our Turzan of Uzkara card?

713
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:50,624
No way!

714
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:52,593
You said everyone
wants to buy it.

715
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:53,968
We got it together.

716
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:56,155
And we're gonna sell
it together as friends.

717
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:57,685
Come on, Lucas.

718
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,562
Bean Bag Boys do
everything together.

719
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:04,176
Okay, I guess that makes sense.

720
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:05,377
- Yes!
- Yes!

721
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:06,549
Lucas!

722
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,496
- Bean Bag Boys for life!
- Yeah!

723
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,251
We're being so bad.

724
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:13,649
We're bad, we're so bad.

725
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,837
We're bad, we're so bad.

726
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,082
We're bad, we're so bad.

727
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:36,250
I need to get rid of these drugs.

728
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:37,329
What are you doing?

729
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:38,719
Getting rid of the drugs.

730
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:40,501
I'm just gonna throw
them in the stream.

731
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:42,368
It can contaminate the water.

732
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:44,094
Well, then we could
throw it in the forest.

733
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:45,454
It's a sex drug.

734
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:48,030
What if a fox eats it
and tries to fuck a squirrel?

735
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,109
It'll kill him.

736
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:51,118
Well, then how do
we get rid of drugs?

737
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:53,227
The same way we
get rid of a baby.

738
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,633
- Abortion?
- Adoption?

739
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:55,890
No!

740
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:58,485
Drop it off at the firehouse
on our way up to the mall.

741
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,274
That's a really good idea.

742
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:02,405
Ah.

743
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,921
I just got a buyer on our card.

744
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,296
Hey, give 'em my address.

745
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,579
My parents aren't home
and I have the best snacks.

746
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:11,624
Heropants69's gonna be here in
five minutes to buy the card.

747
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:13,180
Well, let's get ready.

748
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,985
I found all of these weapons

749
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:16,454
in the back of my parents' closet.

750
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:22,696
I still don't feel
why you need weapons.

751
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:24,383
He could be a pedophile.

752
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,047
He can't molest all three of us.

753
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,430
All he needs is one.

754
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,773
Ah-nal beads?

755
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:37,063
AKA nunchucks, motherfucker!

756
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:40,797
- Yeah!
- Not a toy!

757
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:43,141
Shoot.

758
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,469
Smell like shit.

759
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,397
Hello, uh, I'm looking for Lucas.

760
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,524
That's me.

761
00:31:58,867 --> 00:31:59,867
I'm Claude.

762
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:01,344
Hey.

763
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:03,212
That's my mom back there.

764
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,837
Hiya!

765
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,118
Let's cut the shit.
Are you a pedophile?

766
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,297
What? No.

767
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:11,891
Lucas, if you were a pedophile

768
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:14,344
standing in front of three single
boys, would you admit it?

769
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:15,991
Probably not.

770
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,133
Then why would he?

771
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:18,563
Oh, come on.

772
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:20,243
Do I look like a pedophile?

773
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:21,665
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

774
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,883
That's not fair.

775
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:25,633
You look more of a pedophile
than anyone I've ever seen.

776
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:27,329
Look, I'm not a pedophile.

777
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:28,719
I'm a cool guy.

778
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:30,782
Fine.

779
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:32,907
You can come in
but please keep your shoes off.

780
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:37,168
Why are you bringing a paintball gun?

781
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:39,227
In case anyone fucks with us.

782
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:41,649
This card is exquisite.

783
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:43,397
How'd you get it?

784
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:44,837
The summer I moved here,

785
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,344
me, Max and Thor started
a dog watching business.

786
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,610
We earned eight bucks.

787
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:50,655
And we used the money
to buy an Ascension pack

788
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,852
and this card was in it.

789
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,282
Well, you got very lucky.

790
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,378
The real luck was
meeting Max and Thor.

791
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,315
Fascinating.

792
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,246
We started calling ourselves
the Bean Bag Boys.

793
00:32:58,293 --> 00:32:59,379
You know why?

794
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:01,097
Because you had some bean bags?

795
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:02,151
That's right.

796
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:03,504
Yeah, genius.

797
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:05,090
You got yourself a deal.

798
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,911
Let's go.

799
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:10,186
Let's make it happen.

800
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,116
No. I can't do this.

801
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:15,155
Wha...?

802
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:16,748
- Sorry.
- Lucas!

803
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,482
Get your butt over here right now.

804
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:21,343
Excuse me, is this how all
12-year-olds conduct business?

805
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:23,819
What the hell just happened?
I thought you were cool with this.

806
00:33:23,843 --> 00:33:26,577
You said we wouldn't do this
if one of us wasn't on board.

807
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:27,818
I'm not on board.

808
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:29,310
Why do you care so much?

809
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:30,569
Why don't you care?

810
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,194
This card has a lot of memories.

811
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:33,888
And you're just gonna
throw it all away

812
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:35,718
because you wanna
kiss some basic girl?

813
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:36,811
Savage!

814
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,576
Brixlee isn't just some girl.

815
00:33:38,623 --> 00:33:40,085
We're probably
gonna get married.

816
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,671
Every marriage ends in divorce.

817
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:43,944
Lucas...

818
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,554
you're outvoted.

819
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:48,257
I can tell you're
lashing out with anger.

820
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:49,858
Brixlee's probably
the love of my life.

821
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:52,231
Excuse me, ma'am, could I
get a glass of water, please?

822
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,606
Hello?

823
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:55,631
Ah!

824
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:00,264
Hey, guys?

825
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,944
Hmm...

826
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:05,100
Yeah.

827
00:34:05,147 --> 00:34:06,747
What can you tell me
about her backstory?

828
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,054
Where's she supposed to be from?
She seems quite exotic.

829
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,068
Okay, listen carefully,

830
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,960
'cause I'll make
this offer only once.

831
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:15,835
400 bucks to take
her off your hands.

832
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:18,593
No. We need 550 U.S.

833
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:19,952
Fuck off!

834
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:22,343
That's my entire allowance.

835
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,061
Listen, Claude,
let's just cut the bullshit.

836
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,257
I'm the son of a businesswoman.

837
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,755
And I think we both know,

838
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,241
if you didn't wanna buy the doll,

839
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,749
you would've left already.

840
00:34:31,952 --> 00:34:33,318
Stop treating us like kids.

841
00:34:33,343 --> 00:34:34,661
We know how things work.

842
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:37,233
So, do you wanna buy
the CPR doll or not?

843
00:34:41,983 --> 00:34:42,966
Fools!

844
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:44,507
I'd have paid a thousand!

845
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:47,686
Anyone else feel like
he's gonna fuck that doll?

We've been biking for
almost 14 minutes straight.

856

00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,658
Just give us the drugs.

00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,353
Fuck. How'd you find us?

862
00:35:29,978 --> 00:35:31,642
The phone. They tracked us.

863
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:33,516
We're not giving
you these drugs.

We're in a car, dipshits.
You're not gonna outrun us.

Just give her the sex drugs!

00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,497
Ow.

886
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:50,263
Are you okay?

887
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:51,661
You sure you're okay?

888
00:36:51,724 --> 00:36:52,724
What the hell happened?

889
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:54,037
We were running away
from our babysitter

890
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:55,412
'cause she was trying
to touch our penises.

891
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:56,396
What? That is not true!

892
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:57,521
- Yes, it is!
- It is.

893
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:58,411
I wasn't.

894
00:36:58,436 --> 00:36:59,556
- Yeah, you were!
- I wasn...

895
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:02,302
Go, go, go, go!

896
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:03,294
- What happened?
- Go!

897
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:04,343
Go! Go, go!

898
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,210
Lucas, are you okay?

899
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:09,234
I'm fine. I'm fine.

900
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,078
- Your arm!
- Oh, hell, no.

901
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:17,476
Yo, I'm calling 911.

902
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,703
Oh, no! It's okay.

903
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:20,569
Come on, we gotta go,
we gotta go.

904
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:21,851
We gotta go.

905
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:23,242
I'll get the bikes.

906
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:25,578
Ow!

907
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:27,132
Okay.

908
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,633
I threw the phone
in the prickle bush.

909
00:37:28,657 --> 00:37:29,777
They can't track us anymore.

910
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:31,585
The pain!

911
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:33,405
Lucas, you have to be quiet.

912
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:35,163
Okay, do we have any ice?

913
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,546
No, we're in a fucking alley.

914
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,936
What about pain medication?

915
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:40,398
We have the Molly
we can give him.

916
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:41,303
No!

917
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:43,147
Yeah, he's probably just gonna
try and have sex with us.

918
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:44,405
Call and ambulance!

919
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:45,553
Mission's over!

920
00:37:45,578 --> 00:37:46,968
We'll get busted.

921
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:48,460
Do you even have insurance?

922
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,116
I don't know, do you?

923
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:51,007
I don't know.

924
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:52,405
I think I only
have a deductible.

925
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:53,452
It's all right.

926
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:55,117
This happens to MMA
fighters all the time.

927
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:57,185
We just gotta ram your arm
into something very hard

928
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,530
so it pops back in place.

929
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,975
Fine! Fuck it. Let's just
get this over with.

930
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:05,249
Ow!

931
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:06,522
Come on, easy.

932
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,436
One, two, three!

933
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,460
Wrong arm!

934
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:21,389
- Okay, new site, new site.
- Okay.

935
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,999
Okay. Lie down your back
and give me your arm.

936
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:25,163
Come on.

937
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:26,952
All right.

938
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:28,788
It says this next
part's gonna hurt.

939
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,594
That you should bite
down on something hard.

940
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:31,827
I know.

941
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,108
Open.

942
00:38:37,561 --> 00:38:38,585
There you go.

943
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:40,694
Okay, on three.

944
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:43,460
One, two, three!

945
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:45,311
- Just got a text from Taylor.
- What'd she say?

946
00:38:45,335 --> 00:38:46,515
She wants to know why
you aren't in school

947
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:48,179
and if you're coming
to the party tonight.

948
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:49,382
Just write...

949
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,544
Sorry, I mustn't faint.

950
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:54,669
Whoa!

951
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,380
- Let me help. Let me help.
- Okay!

952
00:38:56,497 --> 00:38:59,130
One, two, three!

953
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:06,576
Wow!

954
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:08,248
I didn't think that
actually work.

955
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:12,927
You're gonna be good, man.

956
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:15,536
No.

957
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:17,567
I'm really not.

958
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:19,559
My parents are getting a divorce.

959
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:24,253
What'd you do?

960
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,903
- Thor!
- What?

961
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:28,083
Sorry.

962
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,778
My dad's moving out.

963
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,796
Whatever happens
between your parents...

964
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:40,499
you always got
the Bean Bag Boys.

965
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,491
We'll never split up.

966
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,999
Bean Bag Boys for life.

967
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:46,639
You promise?

968
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:48,038
- Promise.
- Promise.

969
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,835
Come on, let's get you
some Children's Tylenol.

970
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:02,968
- Need some help, buddy?
- No, I got it.

971
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:05,288
Okay, just do it.

972
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:13,358
Hey, Miles.

973
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:15,585
Hey, man.
Comin' in or comin' off?

974
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,690
Just got off a triple, man.

975
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:18,171
I don't care if I get mugged.

976
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,073
I'm not typing up any more
paperwork today.

977
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:22,529
Cop.

978
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,810
Shit, we have D-R-U-G-S on us.

979
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:29,309
He knows how to spell.

980
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:30,959
Just act normal,
pretend to talk.

981
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:33,850
- About what?
- Just be normal.

982
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:37,060
What do you think
about politics?

983
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,701
It's a complicated issue.

984
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:42,209
This cop's acting weird.

985
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:43,724
He's not poking us.

986
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,990
Just act normal,
just two cool guys laughing.

987
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:54,475
We skipped school.

988
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:55,545
Lucas!

989
00:40:57,264 --> 00:40:58,482
Are we in trouble?

990
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:00,639
Well, usually, I'd call this in.

991
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:03,489
But, because you
were honest with me,

992
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:04,763
just let it slide, all right?

993
00:41:04,943 --> 00:41:06,967
Just promise
not to do it again, okay?

994
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:08,514
We promise, thank you, sir.

995
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:09,725
All right.

996
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:11,185
That was a close one.

997
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:13,123

Come here.

1008
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:35,233
What do you have in your pants?

1009
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:37,202
My penis.

1010
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:38,444
Pull it out.

1011
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:43,038
I also have a big dick.

1012
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,593
Put it back.

1013
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:46,265
I'm being generous today.

1014
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:48,780
We also have drugs.

1015
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:51,302
He was on to us.

1016
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:52,897
Okay, what do you have?

1017
00:41:53,132 --> 00:41:55,132
Schedule 1 controlled substance

1018
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,757
with intent to distribute.

1019
00:41:58,844 --> 00:42:01,772
Brother, these are vitamins, okay?
Children's vitamins at that.

1020
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:03,062
No, those are drugs.

1021
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,243
If that's drugs,
this is drugs, too.

1022
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,390
If you don't arrest
us, I'll report you.

1023
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:08,797
- Lucas!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

1024
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:11,235
I mean, sorry to fucking
swear at kids, but fuck!

1025
00:42:11,274 --> 00:42:13,203
You know, I'm gonna arrest you
for fucking ruining my day.

1026
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:14,617
All right? I'll take them.

1027
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:15,938
Let me go home!

1028
00:42:20,196 --> 00:42:22,204
- He's calling for backup.
- What do we do?

1029
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:23,391
Hello, listen...

1030
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,516
I decided I don't want kids.

1031
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:26,782
What's happening?

1032
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:28,214
That cop's eye-fucking us.

1033
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,500
We have to make a run for it.

1034
00:42:29,524 --> 00:42:30,626
I know what to do.

1035
00:42:30,706 --> 00:42:32,120
Well, it's not up for discuss...

1036
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:33,862
Well, yeah, no,
you may be detective,

1037
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:35,276
but in the marriage,
we're equal.

1038
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:37,753
Just hang up, who cares?

1039
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:40,956
It's free 'cause I'm a cop.

What the fuck, Thor?

1050
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,829
You didn't even care
about my shoulder.

1051
00:43:02,854 --> 00:43:03,917
You just wanted a beer.

1052
00:43:04,354 --> 00:43:05,798
I can care about two things.

1053
00:43:05,823 --> 00:43:07,588
Yeah, you and your stupid beer.

1054
00:43:07,745 --> 00:43:09,159
Now we're fugitives.

1055
00:43:09,307 --> 00:43:10,823
Why are you yelling at me?

1056
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,197
I just ran out without
my family's bikes.

1057
00:43:13,362 --> 00:43:14,985
Cycle Sundays are fucked!

1058
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,010
Guys, guys!

1059
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:17,307
The mall!

1060
00:43:19,322 --> 00:43:20,361
- Yes!
- Yes!

1061
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:22,206
Yes!

1062
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:24,971
Come on.

1063
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:29,016
Oh, shit.

1064
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,041
Holy mu...

1065
00:43:31,963 --> 00:43:33,267
Goddammit!

1066
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:36,743
Great. Now we're trapped
between a highway

1067
00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:38,142
and the authorities.

1068
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:39,855
Well, we wouldn't be in
this position right now

1069
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,081
if you weren't such a narc.

1070
00:43:41,144 --> 00:43:43,597
Guys, the mall's right there.

1071
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:46,042
All we have to do
is cross the highway.

1072
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,753
And the cars aren't even moving.

1073
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:50,706
Now, are we 5th graders
or are we 6th graders?

00:44:06,237 --> 00:44:08,269
Well, I'm going back into the woods.

1079
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:11,120
I'll live off of rainwater and squirrels.
I don't give a fuck.

1080
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:12,520
Uh, no, you won't.

1081
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:13,942
Gosh.

1082
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,051
It's like a parking lot, see?

1083
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:19,387
Wait. You stole another beer?

1084
00:44:19,441 --> 00:44:20,746
What the fuck, Thor?!

1085
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,513
Hey, you guys aren't the
ones who's gonna have

1086
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:24,551
sippy cup on their
goddamn tombstone!

1087
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:26,481
God, say it, don't spray it.

1088
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:30,416
Get off the freeway!

1089
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:31,893
Children crossing.

1090
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:33,948
Please. Children are crossing.

1091
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:36,502
What are you all doing?

1092
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:37,909
Get back to the side!

1093
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:38,963
Go, go, go!

1094
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,049
Fucking idiots!

1095
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,713
Wait, I got a message.

1096
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:44,995
Oh, it's from Taylor.

1097
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,894
She said Marcus is
coming to the party.

1098
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:48,783
He has a huge crush on Brixlee.

1099
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:49,988
She's definitely gonna kiss him.

1100
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:51,293
He's the nicest kid in our grade.

1101
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:53,636
Wait, wait. I'm the nicest
kid in our grade!

1102
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:55,214
It goes, me,

1103
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:58,073
Marcus, Max, you.

1104
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,355
I'm way nicer than Max.

1105
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,698
No, you're not!

1106
00:45:00,753 --> 00:45:02,657
You made Miss Willoughby
cry last year.

1107
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,794
Hey, she was already crying,
I just took her picture.

1108
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:05,972
Guys! Guys!

1109
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,119
Look!

1110
00:45:07,144 --> 00:45:08,378
Oh, shit!

1111
00:45:09,464 --> 00:45:10,464
Shit!

1112
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,792
Oh, fuck!

1113
00:45:11,903 --> 00:45:13,081
Let's go back!

1114
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:15,589
We're trapped!

1115
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,300
We're trapped!

1116
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:22,504
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

1117
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:23,622
No, we're not.

1118
00:45:23,669 --> 00:45:24,903
We just need to time it, okay?

1119
00:45:24,981 --> 00:45:26,239
We just need to time it right.

1120
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,456
We can do this, guys!

1121
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:28,872
We can do this!

1122
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:36,015
- Punch it, crazy!
- No!

1123
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:42,294
Oh, shit! He made it!

1124
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:44,239
I did it!

1125
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:47,042
Lucas. Lucas, look
at me right now.

1126
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:49,402
I know you're scared.
I'm not... at all.

1127
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,597
Shut up, Thor!

1128
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:56,261
Lucas!

1129
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
No!

1130
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:03,847
I'm not dead!

1131
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,738
I'm not dead!

1132
00:46:05,777 --> 00:46:07,416
He got here, man. Come on!

1133
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:08,441
Fuck you!

1134
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:09,675
I love you, too!

1135
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,689
Now, come over here!

1136
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:11,902
I want my mom!

1137
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:12,941
- Come on!
- Come on!

1138
00:46:13,425 --> 00:46:15,449
I'm fine. I'll just live here.

1139
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,722
I'm good.

1140
00:46:16,747 --> 00:46:17,660
Come on!

1141
00:46:17,685 --> 00:46:18,808
You got this!

1142
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:20,425
All right.

1143
00:46:20,496 --> 00:46:22,199
Come on, Thor,
you're not sippy cup.

1144
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:23,456
You're a badass.

1145
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:25,308
Come on, Thor!

1146
00:46:26,824 --> 00:46:28,066
I dropped my beer!

1147
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:48,464
Wait.

1148
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:50,058
That's my dad's CPR doll.

1149
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,646
- Oh!
- That's my dad's CPR doll!

1150
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:52,990
We're not murderers!

1151
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:54,129
We're safe!

1152
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:55,857
We're not fucking killers!

1153
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,942
We're not, yeah!

1154
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:07,279
Beep, beep.

1155
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:08,326
Excuse me.

1156
00:47:08,732 --> 00:47:09,732
Pardon me.

1157
00:47:09,881 --> 00:47:10,904
Excuse me.

1158
00:47:12,138 --> 00:47:13,138
Sorry.

1159
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:17,217
Hey!

1160
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:19,185
We called about the
BD Rolling Thunder.

1161
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:21,146
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1162
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:22,881
Sold it.

1163
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:26,177
Haha, nice joke, ha.
So funny, waa...

1164
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:27,865
No, I did. I sold it.

1165
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,443
Two girls. Said they knew you.

1166
00:47:30,443 --> 00:47:31,957
Fuck you!

1167
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,357
I'm gonna kill your family!

1168
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:34,701
He's on for sure, huh?

1169
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,208
I'm gonna turn your
whole family to zombies!

1170
00:47:36,232 --> 00:47:37,067
Max!

1171
00:47:37,092 --> 00:47:40,279
I was gonna say,
you didn't let me finish.

1172
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,037
They left a note for ya.

1173
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:52,285
- Why are they walking like that?
- I don't know.

1174
00:47:56,896 --> 00:47:58,021
You guys track us.

1175
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,637
I threw your bag
in prickle bushes.

1176
00:47:59,662 --> 00:48:00,520
Dumbass.

1177
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,679
You told us that your
life would be over

1178
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:03,521
if you didn't get a
BD Rolling Thunder.

1179
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:06,724
And this is the only place a
child could get to on a tricycle.

1180
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:08,301
Okay, I have the drugs,

1181
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:09,935
now give me the drone.

1182
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:14,705
You fucking kidding me?

1183
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:18,846
What in the actual fuck?

1184
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:20,001
These are just gummy vitamins.

1185
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:21,338
I told you she was gonna check.

1186
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:22,713
Where is the Molly?

1187
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:23,767
Where is it?

1188
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:24,822
A cop has it.

1189
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:26,971
You gave our drugs to a cop?

1190
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:27,977
Wait.

1191
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:29,830
Look, I know you don't know us,

1192
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:31,510
and you think we're
just stupid kids,

1193
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:32,751
but just listen...

1194
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:34,485
whatever problems you're having,

1195
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,103
drugs are not the answer.

1196
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,799
Drugs just give you a
false sense of reality.

1197
00:48:38,955 --> 00:48:40,697
You might think
your lives are bad,

1198
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:42,486
but you have family and friends

1199
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:43,337
who love you...

1200
00:48:43,362 --> 00:48:44,556
Can you shut the fuck up?

1201
00:48:44,581 --> 00:48:47,096
I just spent $600
on a fucking drone.

1202
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,994
You ruined my passionate moment.

1203
00:48:49,072 --> 00:48:50,322
Well, it was stupid.

1204
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:51,533
This day is fucked.

1205
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:53,125
Benji is the only
one who has Molly,

1206
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,572
and he won't sell it to us.

1207
00:48:55,002 --> 00:48:56,697
Well, I'm sorry, we're fucked.

1208
00:48:57,377 --> 00:48:58,377
We'll do it.

1209
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,361
We'll get you drugs.

1210
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:02,953
The fuck we will!

1211
00:49:02,978 --> 00:49:04,143
What the hell?

1212
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:05,933
Do you think he would sell to kids?

1213
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,908
We're not kids. We're tweens.

1214
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:10,314
What do we have to lose?

1215
00:49:13,135 --> 00:49:14,353
So it's a deal?

1216
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:18,018
Max, this is fucking insane.

1217
00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:19,963
You should take the
goddamn punishment.

1218
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:21,376
Lucas and I will
go to the party.

1219
00:49:21,455 --> 00:49:23,283
We'll cockblock anyone
who gets near Brixlee.

1220
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,243
They didn't invite you.

1221
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:28,266
What?

1222
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,891
The popular kids only invited me.

1223
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:32,743
What do you mean?

1224
00:49:32,938 --> 00:49:34,434
They think you're kind of...

1225
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:35,660
random.

1226
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:37,216
Oh.

1227
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,763
But it's okay, 'cause once
those guys get to know you,

1228
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:40,981
they'll see what I see...

1229
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:42,302
that you're not random.

1230
00:49:42,552 --> 00:49:43,817
That you're specific.

1231
00:49:44,005 --> 00:49:45,341
I'm not buying drugs.

1232
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:46,503
Neither am I.

1233
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,497
You guys don't have to.
I'll do all the talking.

1234
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,950
I just need your height in there.

1235
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,778
You're the only one of us that
looks like they could be in college.

1236
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:55,059
Guys...

1237
00:49:55,638 --> 00:49:56,848
are you in or out?

1238
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:01,851
So, you guys did all of
this for a kissing party?

1239
00:50:01,906 --> 00:50:04,547
No, there's also gonna
be cool boys there.

1240
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:06,586
I remember my first kissing party.

1241
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,678
It was the summer after 6th
grade at Manush Patel's house.

1242
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:10,787
Who'd you kiss?

1243
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:12,351
Uh, Manush's sister.

1244
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:14,867
Wait, you weren't there?

1245
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,050
No, we didn't really know
each other then, I mean,

1246
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:18,107
we were in the same grade

1247
00:50:18,132 --> 00:50:20,172
but we didn't really become
close until 8th grade.

1248
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:21,594
Oh.

1249
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:23,771
I just figured you guys
knew each other for longer.

1250
00:50:23,796 --> 00:50:24,859
Yeah, everybody knows

1251
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:26,446
you meet your best
friends in kindergarten.

1252
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:27,316
Yeah.

1253
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:28,872
The only reason you're
friends with people back then

1254
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:30,136
is 'cause you live
close to each other.

1255
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,880
And because, like,
your parents are friends.

1256
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:33,808
No, that's not true for us.

1257
00:50:34,066 --> 00:50:35,840
We're friends because
we like each other.

1258
00:50:35,934 --> 00:50:37,479
And we live close together.

1259
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,004
And our parents are friends.

1260
00:50:49,273 --> 00:50:50,359
Okay, come here.

1261
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:53,609
Go in, buy two pills.

1262
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:54,921
Ask for Benji.

1263
00:50:55,062 --> 00:50:56,444
Do not mention Hannah.

1264
00:50:56,648 --> 00:50:57,695
Who's Hannah?

1265
00:50:58,093 --> 00:50:59,021
I am.

1266
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:00,046
Oh.

1267
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,289
I'm Max.

1268
00:51:01,335 --> 00:51:02,656
Yeah, I know who you are.

1269
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:05,163
Just go in there, buy the pills

1270
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:06,790
and then I'll trade
you for the drone.

1271
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:10,907
Hey, if this goes bad,

1272
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:12,196
drive off.

1273
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,579
Okay.

1274
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,297
It's not too late to turn back.

1275
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,376
No. We have to get the drugs

1276
00:51:17,462 --> 00:51:19,946
so we can get the drone
so we can go to the party.

1277
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:44,968
Hello?

1278
00:51:53,615 --> 00:51:55,279
<i>I am your daddy.</i>

1279
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:56,819
<i>You are my baby.</i>

1280
00:51:56,975 --> 00:51:57,850
<i>Yes, daddy!</i>

1281
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,623
<i>You will stay down
here and suffer</i>

1282
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,944
<i>until you learn to be men.</i>

1283
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:05,389
<i>Yes, daddy!</i>

1284
00:52:05,537 --> 00:52:06,967
<i>What do babies wear?</i>

1285
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:08,186
<i>Diapers!</i>

1286
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,332
Good evening.

1287
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:14,426
We're looking for Benji.

1288
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,637
Hey, dickless! Come here.

1289
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:20,293
Yes, daddy.

1290
00:52:20,692 --> 00:52:22,996
Go find Benji,
tell him he's got visitors.

1291
00:52:23,496 --> 00:52:24,496
Yes, daddy.

1292
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,238
That's your son?

1293
00:52:28,652 --> 00:52:31,137
You guys can go sit your asses
down over there and wait.

1294
00:52:36,402 --> 00:52:39,050
<i>Drop and give me 20,
you fucking baby!</i>

1295
00:52:47,527 --> 00:52:48,541
Can I help you?

1296
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:49,745
Good afternoon.

1297
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,879
We would like to buy two
pieces of Molly, please.

1298
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:59,394
Did Raffi from
Sigma Nu send you?

1299
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:02,511
He did, that fucker.
You guys are like seven.

1300
00:53:02,651 --> 00:53:04,564
Oh, except for you,
I recognize you from Econ.

1301
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:05,925
What's up, man?

1302
00:53:07,457 --> 00:53:09,746
Seriously, I'm not
selling drugs to kids.

1303
00:53:09,996 --> 00:53:11,504
We're not kids, we're tweens.

1304
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:15,363
Who told you to come here?

1305
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,808
Sell us the drugs
and you'll find out.

1306
00:53:22,996 --> 00:53:24,011
All right.

1307
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:26,246
Stay there.

1308
00:53:32,738 --> 00:53:33,808
Hey.

1309
00:53:34,886 --> 00:53:36,636
How long do you
think it's gonna be?

1310
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:44,214
You made me high.

1311
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:56,719
Tell me who sent you.

1312
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:00,790
Hannah.

1313
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,670
What am I, a speck?

1314
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,014
So this is what
she thinks of me, huh.

1315
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:10,788
You can tell Hannah
that if she wants Molly,

1316
00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:13,100
she can suck my dick.

1317
00:54:14,022 --> 00:54:15,702
You shouldn't talk
about a woman like that.

1318
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:17,653
The only time she
should suck your dick

1319
00:54:17,678 --> 00:54:19,201
is when she gives you consent.

1320
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,428
You can suck my dick.

1321
00:54:22,483 --> 00:54:24,444
And you can suck my dick, too.

1322
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,061
What about me?
I'm just gonna sit here?

1323
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:31,881
We're the Bean Bag Boys.
We do everything together.

1324
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:35,272
Get the fuck out of here, you
little fucking babies. Let's go.

1325
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,475
Get out!

1326
00:54:40,506 --> 00:54:41,584
Hey, guys, wait.

1327
00:54:42,803 --> 00:54:44,763
I have something here that
might change your mind.

1328
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:47,561
Hurry up.

1329
00:54:49,889 --> 00:54:51,827
Bitch! Now who's the baby?

1330
00:54:52,068 --> 00:54:53,631
- Holy shit.
- What the fuck?

1331
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:55,928
If I don't get those drugs,
I'm gonna be grounded!

1332
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:58,077
And then,
I'll never get to kiss Brixlee!

1333
00:54:58,131 --> 00:54:59,116
Max!

1334
00:54:59,141 --> 00:55:00,788
What the fuck are you doing?

1335
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,147
You sell drugs.

1336
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:03,514
We came here to buy them.

1337
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:05,755
So now you're gonna
sell us the drugs.

1338
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,756
Do not test me!

1339
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:09,577
Okay.

1340
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:13,763
You want the drugs,
I'm not your parent. Here.

1341
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:15,091
Thanks.

1342
00:55:15,857 --> 00:55:16,857
Oh, shit.

1343
00:55:18,162 --> 00:55:19,529
Oh, you're fucking dead.

1344
00:55:22,748 --> 00:55:23,948
The fuck's going on down here?

1345
00:55:27,107 --> 00:55:28,271
She just dropped the charges.

1346
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,302
Oh, God!

1347
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,631
Holy shit.

1348
00:55:42,982 --> 00:55:44,295
Max, watch out!

1349
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:49,185
I got your back.

1350
00:55:49,982 --> 00:55:50,982
Thor!

1351
00:55:59,596 --> 00:56:01,924
Oh, my God, I just killed a man!

1352
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,471
Lucas, get the drugs!

1353
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:09,315
We were never here!

1354
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:12,463
Start the fucking car!

1355
00:56:14,352 --> 00:56:15,423
What's happening?

1356
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,532
Fucking go!

1357
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:17,579
What?

1358
00:56:19,532 --> 00:56:20,532
Drive!

1359
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,774
Drive!

1360
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:31,913
Lucas, drugs.

1361
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:35,107
No, no, no, no, no.

1362
00:56:35,132 --> 00:56:36,530
Let me see what's in the bottle.

1363
00:56:37,499 --> 00:56:38,499
Yeah.

1364
00:56:43,077 --> 00:56:44,812
Okay, just-just give it to me.

1365
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,702
Wow, you guys
are little badasses.

1366
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:55,210
'Cause we're the Bean Bag Boys.

1367
00:56:55,772 --> 00:56:57,022
I don't know what that means.

1368
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:58,452
We have bean bags.

1369
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:02,343
It's been real, guys.

1370
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,210
Have fun at your kissing party.

1371
00:57:05,538 --> 00:57:06,593
Thank you!

1372
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:13,702
Oh. Only 1.7 miles away.

1373
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:18,358
What's wrong?

1374
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:19,568
We got the drone,
everything worked out.

1375
00:57:19,592 --> 00:57:20,592
Max.

1376
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:23,679
I got punched
in the fucking face, okay?

1377
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:26,038
We bought drugs.

1378
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:28,554
Can we just go home now?

1379
00:57:40,097 --> 00:57:41,409
Guys, my dad.

1380
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,972
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, buddy!

1381
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:47,808
I got an early flight,
so I'll be home in 15 minutes.

1382
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:50,259
15 minutes from now,
or 15 minutes from later?

1383
00:57:50,284 --> 00:57:51,737
Haha, funny guy.

1384
00:57:51,823 --> 00:57:53,292
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

1385
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:56,618
My dad will be
home in 15 minutes.

1386
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,023
Maybe he won't notice
the drone's gone.

1387
00:57:59,048 --> 00:58:00,884
He'll notice.
He's very observant.

1388
00:58:00,961 --> 00:58:02,712
That's why my mom
fell in love with him.

1389
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:05,837
The drone has to be
home before your dad.

1390
00:58:06,563 --> 00:58:07,563
I know.

1391
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:08,867
Just the drone.

1392
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:10,187
Not you.

1393
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:11,726
Just the drone.

1394
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:17,250
Okay.

1395
00:58:21,328 --> 00:58:22,328
Here we go!

1396
00:58:23,172 --> 00:58:24,281
Yeah! Get there!

1397
00:58:28,313 --> 00:58:30,148
- Careful.
- I got this, I got this. Oh!

1398
00:58:32,078 --> 00:58:33,484
Fly like the wind, Max.

1399
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:36,761
Yeah, uh, take a right up here.

1400
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:41,144
- I can see your house.
- There it is, there it is.

1401
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:42,652
The windows are closed.

1402
00:58:42,714 --> 00:58:43,746
Shit, what do I do?

1403
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:44,949
The chimney!

1404
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:51,433
It's very tight.

1405
00:58:51,472 --> 00:58:52,472
You got this.

1406
00:58:53,308 --> 00:58:54,785
Yeah, I can't see! I can't see!

1407
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,434
There's ash all over the camera.

1408
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:57,683
Use the Force!

1409
00:58:57,769 --> 00:59:00,136
No, no. I can do this.
I know my house perfectly.

1410
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:01,644
I can do this with
my eyes closed.

1411
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:03,377
Don't break anything.

1412
00:59:03,402 --> 00:59:05,199
Trust me, I got this.

1413
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:23,490
- You did it!
- Yeah!

1414
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,865
Yeah!

1415
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:27,865
- I'm the best pilot ever!
- Yeah!

1416
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:37,940
- I think we did it.
- Yeah!

1417
00:59:37,987 --> 00:59:39,533
Mission accomplished!

1418
00:59:40,979 --> 00:59:42,049
Hey, Dad!

1419
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:44,041
Did you get home safe?

1420
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:49,502
Uh, huh?

1421
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:52,385
I love you.

1422
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:53,994
Dad?

1423
00:59:54,877 --> 00:59:55,932
Dad, please.

1424
00:59:56,237 --> 00:59:57,330
Say "I love you" back.

1425
00:59:57,713 --> 00:59:58,979
I need to hear it.

1426
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:01,166
Hello?

1427
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:07,068
My dad says I'm grounded.

1428
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,270
And now I'm never gonna
be able to kiss Brixlee.

1429
01:00:09,615 --> 01:00:11,966
It's okay, Max.
There'll be other parties.

1430
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,444
Lucas, you don't get it.

1431
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:14,921
He's right, Lucas.

1432
01:00:14,984 --> 01:00:16,616
This party could
change our lives.

1433
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:17,819
And you don't even care.

1434
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:19,390
It's not cool at all.

1435
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,131
Yeah, you would know
what's not cool.

1436
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:22,679
What the fuck does that mean?

1437
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:24,529
Go sip a beer, sippy cup.

1438
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:25,687
I love beer.

1439
01:00:25,866 --> 01:00:27,452
So yes, I will.

1440
01:00:27,477 --> 01:00:28,811
And you might think
you're so mature

1441
01:00:28,835 --> 01:00:30,060
but the truth is,

1442
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,202
you don't have pubes.

1443
01:00:31,304 --> 01:00:32,468
And I have six.

1444
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,287
You say you have pubes,

1445
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:35,375
but you also say you drink beer

1446
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:36,710
and I know you don't.

1447
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,819
Stop arguing!

1448
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:39,327
Just admit,
you skipped the audition

1449
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:40,859
because you thought
it wasn't cool

1450
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:42,757
even though your voice
is a fucking gift.

1451
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:44,351
And you always talk a big game

1452
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:45,765
and you never back it up

1453
01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:46,859
like in the freeway.

1454
01:00:46,905 --> 01:00:49,779
Oh, sorry I didn't wanna
cross 12 lanes of traffic

1455
01:00:49,804 --> 01:00:51,436
so you can kiss some skank.

1456
01:00:51,843 --> 01:00:53,077
Oh, shit!

1457
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:55,280
She's not a skank!
She's the love of my life!

1458
01:00:55,312 --> 01:00:56,341
You take that back!

1459
01:00:56,366 --> 01:00:57,984
Hey, no karate.

1460
01:00:58,148 --> 01:00:59,757
Stop fighting!

1461
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:02,687
You should never
call a woman a skank!

1462
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,241
You should never call
a woman anything!

1463
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:07,218
And you!

1464
01:01:07,243 --> 01:01:08,599
You made us ditch school,

1465
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,475
run around with drugs,

1466
01:01:10,564 --> 01:01:12,548
and locked a cop in
a convenience store

1467
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:15,775
with what I now
suspect is a dildo!

1468
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:19,859
What the fuck are you
looking at, Gandalf?!

1469
01:01:20,538 --> 01:01:22,023
You guys don't understand shit!

1470
01:01:22,085 --> 01:01:24,506
I have hormones
flowing through my body

1471
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:26,304
making me do crazy things.

1472
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:28,076
Do you even know
what it feels like

1473
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,203
to wanna rub up against
a tree all the time?

1474
01:01:31,265 --> 01:01:32,648
You think you're better than us.

1475
01:01:32,673 --> 01:01:34,374
Not better, just more mature.

1476
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:36,444
I'm into romance
and current shit

1477
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:38,679
and you guys are still
into little kids stuff.

1478
01:01:38,843 --> 01:01:40,648
I don't even know
why we're still friends.

1479
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,727
Everything you like
is now canceled.

1480
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,383
Birthdays are canceled.

1481
01:02:13,469 --> 01:02:15,368
Holidays are canceled.

1482
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:16,929
Summers, canceled.

1483
01:02:16,954 --> 01:02:18,508
Winter is coming.

1484
01:02:18,844 --> 01:02:19,858
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1485
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:22,633
No, no, no! You are no longer
allowed to call me Daddy.

1486
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,446
Call me Andrew, or Mr. Newman,
or Warden.

1487
01:02:26,594 --> 01:02:28,337
Beneath that cherubic face,

1488
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:29,969
devil lives inside you.

1489
01:02:30,962 --> 01:02:32,579
I will always love you

1490
01:02:32,907 --> 01:02:34,360
because you are my son.

1491
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,415
But I no longer like you.

1492
01:02:44,157 --> 01:02:45,313
Thorny?

1493
01:02:45,524 --> 01:02:47,883
I just got off the
phone with Max's mom.

1494
01:02:49,704 --> 01:02:52,290
Did you know he skipped school
and biked to the mall by himself?

1495
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:54,344
- He said that?
- He did.

1496
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:56,039
Promise me you'll
never do something

1497
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,165
as stupid as that, okay?

1498
01:02:58,328 --> 01:02:59,422
I-I promise.

1499
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:04,749
And then we run
across the highway,

1500
01:03:04,774 --> 01:03:06,366
my arm got ripped out

1501
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:09,157
and a fake woman
shot out of a car

1502
01:03:09,182 --> 01:03:10,751
but we still got the drugs

1503
01:03:10,776 --> 01:03:12,727
but then we traded
the drone for it

1504
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:14,704
and Max destroyed
his house with it

1505
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:17,391
but it was only because
he wanted to marry Brixlee

1506
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:19,297
and now he can't because
he's grounded for life

1507
01:03:19,322 --> 01:03:20,657
and we got into a huge fight

1508
01:03:20,688 --> 01:03:22,446
and the Bean Bag
Boys are broke up

1509
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:23,954
and... am I in trouble?

1510
01:03:23,979 --> 01:03:25,501
Okay, son, now, look.

1511
01:03:25,526 --> 01:03:27,469
I love a good story with
a bunch of gibberish

1512
01:03:27,494 --> 01:03:28,813
just as much as anybody, okay?

1513
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,594
And I know you're going
through a stressful time.

1514
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:32,992
But it doesn't give you
a reason to tell us fibs.

1515
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:34,530
I'm not fibbing.

1516
01:03:34,555 --> 01:03:36,711
I'm 100% sure you're
fibbing to me.

1517
01:03:36,774 --> 01:03:37,858
I'm not fibbing!

1518
01:03:37,883 --> 01:03:40,282
Okay, I think I understand
what's happening here.

1519
01:03:40,508 --> 01:03:42,008
You think you're losing us.

1520
01:03:42,587 --> 01:03:44,947
And now, you're worried you're
gonna lose your friends, too.

1521
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:47,968
Look at me, man,
we'll always be there.

1522
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,594
Right, I mean,
don't get me wrong.

1523
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,118
You know, me and your mom
are not the same people

1524
01:03:51,142 --> 01:03:52,459
we were when we first met.

1525
01:03:52,484 --> 01:03:53,547
Mm-hmm.

1526
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,453
Tend to grow apart sometimes
but it's okay.

1527
01:03:56,789 --> 01:03:58,305
You remember your hermit crab?

1528
01:03:58,391 --> 01:04:00,407
- Herman? Yeah.
- That's right, Herman.

1529
01:04:00,516 --> 01:04:02,022
And you remember why he died.

1530
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,243
Oh, son of a...

1531
01:04:03,268 --> 01:04:05,258
You told me he ran away!

1532
01:04:05,283 --> 01:04:06,532
Technically, yes.

1533
01:04:06,557 --> 01:04:07,946
He ran away, but then he died.

1534
01:04:07,971 --> 01:04:09,555
Oh, my gosh, how?

1535
01:04:09,696 --> 01:04:11,015
Herman died

1536
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,368
because hermit crabs
grow out of their shell

1537
01:04:13,393 --> 01:04:15,282
and they need to find new,

1538
01:04:15,307 --> 01:04:17,422
bigger seashells on
the beach to grow into

1539
01:04:17,447 --> 01:04:19,446
or they die and we
didn't know that.

1540
01:04:19,563 --> 01:04:21,790
So, Herman died
because of you guys?

1541
01:04:21,883 --> 01:04:23,516
The point is

1542
01:04:23,712 --> 01:04:26,030
you and your friends
are growing and changing

1543
01:04:26,055 --> 01:04:27,852
and y'all need to
find bigger shells.

1544
01:04:27,985 --> 01:04:29,406
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

1545
01:04:30,524 --> 01:04:31,618
Okay.

1546
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:33,477
We need to blame
those pet stores.

1547
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:52,256
It's Lucas.

1548
01:04:54,327 --> 01:04:55,527
You scared the shit out of me.

1549
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:57,420
I didn't want your
parents to see my face.

1550
01:04:58,749 --> 01:05:00,020
Why are you even here?

1551
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:02,006
I've grown a lot in
the last two hours.

1552
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:04,506
My parents' divorce
has really changed me.

1553
01:05:05,061 --> 01:05:06,835
If the Bean Bag Boys
don't grow together,

1554
01:05:06,905 --> 01:05:08,170
they'll grow apart.

1555
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:09,803
I don't want that.

1556
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:12,460
I don't want to get
a divorce from you.

1557
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,561
Then you need to go
to Soren's party.

1558
01:05:14,586 --> 01:05:15,889
You need to sneak out.

1559
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:17,372
I can't, I'm grounded.

1560
01:05:17,397 --> 01:05:19,585
Besides, Brixlee's necklace
is still in the kiln.

1561
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:21,561
Let me worry about the necklace.

1562
01:05:21,702 --> 01:05:23,272
And what are your
parents gonna do,

1563
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:24,654
double ground you?

1564
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,811
Is Brixlee your forever or not?

1565
01:05:29,436 --> 01:05:31,553
Then you need to
come with me now.

1566
01:05:32,038 --> 01:05:33,310
Fine, I'll go

1567
01:05:33,335 --> 01:05:35,256
but I'm not apologizing to Thor.

1568
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:36,499
He's not coming.

1569
01:05:36,819 --> 01:05:37,819
Good.

1570
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:39,983
Fuck that bitch.

1571
01:05:40,163 --> 01:05:41,374
Let me get my jacket.

1572
01:05:42,577 --> 01:05:43,647
Hey, Max.

1573
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
Yeah?

1574
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,163
Bring that dick.

1575
01:05:53,926 --> 01:05:55,418
You said Thor wasn't coming.

1576
01:05:55,443 --> 01:05:56,793
What the hell's he doing here?

1577
01:05:56,895 --> 01:05:58,222
Parent trapped your asses.

1578
01:05:58,363 --> 01:06:01,355
See, now we're all in a bigger
hermit crabshell together.

1579
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:04,707
It made sense when
my parents said it.

1580
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,605
So you took the blame for us, huh?

1581
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:08,824
Yeah, I thought about
what you would do

1582
01:06:08,941 --> 01:06:10,379
and did the opposite!

1583
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:13,457
This party,
it's gonna be an epic rager.

1584
01:06:13,551 --> 01:06:14,840
Okay, sippy cup.

1585
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:16,684
Stay out of my way, Maxipad.

1586
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:31,184
Aww, don't you boys look cute?

1587
01:06:31,277 --> 01:06:33,066
Everybody's in the basement.

1588
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:35,387
I don't even wanna know
what's going on down there.

1589
01:06:35,473 --> 01:06:36,895
Come on in, fellas.

1590
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:38,676
Hi!

1591
01:07:01,398 --> 01:07:02,710
Oh, my God, you made it.

1592
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:06,585
Max, I want you to meet Brixlee.

1593
01:07:07,546 --> 01:07:09,484
Hi, I'm Max.

1594
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:11,734
Hi.

1595
01:07:12,546 --> 01:07:14,085
It's nice to finally meet you.

1596
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,866
You too.

1597
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:17,398
Cool jacket.

1598
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:18,944
Thank you.

1599
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:20,640
I got it all by myself

1600
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,155
with my mom.

1601
01:07:22,374 --> 01:07:24,562
I go shopping with my mom, too.

1602
01:07:25,632 --> 01:07:27,296
This is going so well.

1603
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:30,319
Did you bring the necklace?

1604
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:34,319
Brixlee, this is for you.

1605
01:07:35,015 --> 01:07:36,187
Oh, thanks!

1606
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:37,390
Pretty.

1607
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,585
They're Anal.

1608
01:07:38,734 --> 01:07:40,030
Oh, fancy.

1609
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:45,444
I'm gonna wear this later.

1610
01:07:45,554 --> 01:07:46,687
Thanks, Max.

1611
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:49,702
Wassup, sippy cup?

1612
01:07:50,773 --> 01:07:52,528
Not much, just, uh...

1613
01:07:52,553 --> 01:07:54,116
got into a fight
with a bunch of men

1614
01:07:54,149 --> 01:07:55,975
and, uh, stole a beer.

1615
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,921
It's not like sippy cup
is gonna drink it.

1616
01:08:00,405 --> 01:08:02,234
Not only am I gonna drink it,

1617
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:04,015
I'm gonna break the record.

1618
01:08:05,812 --> 01:08:07,859
I'm gonna take four sips.

1619
01:08:08,023 --> 01:08:09,413
Four's impossible.

1620
01:08:09,554 --> 01:08:10,827
Soren can't even do four.

1621
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:11,905
Shut up.

1622
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:14,109
Drink.

1623
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:32,842
That's one.

1624
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:34,562
Big deal.

1625
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,241
That's two.

1626
01:08:40,702 --> 01:08:41,819
Mm-kay.

1627
01:08:47,694 --> 01:08:49,046
That's three!

1628
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,851
This is insane.

1629
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:52,968
He's gonna barf.

1630
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,929
Somebody get him a sippy cup.

1631
01:08:55,296 --> 01:08:57,163
Sippy cup! Sippy cup!

1632
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,287
Sippy cup! Sippy cup!

1633
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:01,631
Sippy cup! Sippy cup!

1634
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:03,819
Sippy cup! Sippy cup!

1635
01:09:04,351 --> 01:09:05,374
Sippy cup!

1636
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:08,366
That's fucking four!

1637
01:09:08,968 --> 01:09:09,968
Fuck!

1638
01:09:10,254 --> 01:09:14,082
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

1639
01:09:14,293 --> 01:09:16,293
I'm a fucking alcoholic!

1640
01:09:20,004 --> 01:09:21,965
Four sips. Badass.

1641
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:23,488
Mad respect to Thor.

1642
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,385
Eyes up here.

1643
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,220
If you don't consent to kissing,

1644
01:09:27,306 --> 01:09:28,455
that's cool.

1645
01:09:28,525 --> 01:09:30,119
You can go play VR upstairs.

1646
01:09:30,385 --> 01:09:31,978
But if you're staying down here,

1647
01:09:32,049 --> 01:09:35,095
you better strap in because
shit's about to get real.

1648
01:09:36,728 --> 01:09:37,963
Let's spin a bottle.

1649
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,072
Well, then it's a good thing
I got a bottle right here!

1650
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:47,595

01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:09,943
I'm out.

1656
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,396
Where are you going?

1657
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,732
That was nasty.

1658
01:10:12,849 --> 01:10:14,763
I'm going upstairs to play VR.

1659
01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:17,318
If you leave,
you can never come back.

1660
01:10:17,818 --> 01:10:19,545
Oh, no!

1661
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:29,580
Brixlee...

1662
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:31,314
your turn.

1663
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:41,872
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon...

1664
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,493
Oh, my God, this is the most
dramatic thing I've ever seen.

1665
01:11:13,525 --> 01:11:15,267
He's not gonna do it.

1666
01:11:16,924 --> 01:11:18,111
He's gonna do it.

1667
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:21,478
I can't do it.

1668
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:24,914
People don't change.

1669
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:26,220
He's still sippy cup.

1670
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,931
Wait, wait. Kissy cup.

1671
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:30,408
Kissy cup!

1672
01:11:30,712 --> 01:11:31,712
Kissy cup!

1673
01:11:31,907 --> 01:11:32,907
Kissy cup!

1674
01:11:33,056 --> 01:11:34,056
Kissy cup!

1675
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:35,563
Fuck off, Atticus!

1676
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:36,603
His name is Thor.

1677
01:11:36,628 --> 01:11:38,805
And everyone knows your
mom plagiarized a cookbook.

1678
01:11:39,923 --> 01:11:41,024
Thor, wait up.

1679
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,774
I'm sorry I called you a tryhard.

1680
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:51,196
No, you were right.

1681
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,085
This whole time, I've been

1682
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,782
trying to be someone
who I wasn't.

1683
01:11:56,243 --> 01:11:57,626
I got an earring.

1684
01:11:58,048 --> 01:11:59,384
I drank a beer.

1685
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:01,720
I quit singing.

1686
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:06,563
I guess I went a little
crazy today, too.

1687
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:11,774
Let's get outta here.

1688
01:12:12,556 --> 01:12:13,556
No.

1689
01:12:13,915 --> 01:12:15,126
You don't wanna do that.

1690
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:17,696
You're gonna stay down
here and kiss Brixlee.

1691
01:12:18,938 --> 01:12:20,665
Bean Bag Boys do
everything together.

1692
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:23,876
Not everything.

1693
01:12:24,626 --> 01:12:25,954
Not anymore.

1694
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:31,657
Maybe those old girls were right.

1695
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,468
Maybe we're on different paths.

1696
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:36,602
Yeah.

1697
01:12:37,547 --> 01:12:39,102
What are you gonna do?

1698
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,780
I don't know.

1699
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:43,539
I just know it's not this.

1700
01:12:43,781 --> 01:12:45,313
No way.

1701
01:12:45,453 --> 01:12:46,898
This is insane.

1702
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:48,586
Forget spin the bottle.

1703
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,875
Now, go over there
and kiss your future wife.

1704
01:12:55,203 --> 01:12:56,203
Bye.

1705
01:12:57,359 --> 01:12:58,359
Bye.

1706
01:13:25,298 --> 01:13:26,557
Brixlee...

1707
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:28,471
can I kiss you?

1708
01:13:30,127 --> 01:13:31,205
Okay.

1709
01:14:00,188 --> 01:14:01,188
Aaah!

1710
01:14:01,454 --> 01:14:02,454
Cool.

1711
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,938
Where am I?

1712
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:05,743
Oh, here I am.

1713
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,118
Lucas, I'm leaving.

1714
01:14:09,102 --> 01:14:10,641
You sure you don't wanna try this?

1715
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:12,297
Nah, I'm good.

1716
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,446
Wanna go to my house
and play Ascension?

1717
01:14:18,797 --> 01:14:21,469
I don't wanna play
Ascension anymore.

1718
01:14:22,485 --> 01:14:24,203
Then who am I gonna play with?

1719
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:25,985
You'll find someone.

1720
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,743
My face feels so tingly.

1721
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:31,422
No way!

1722
01:14:31,454 --> 01:14:32,688
Oh, my God!

1723
01:14:32,713 --> 01:14:34,750
This is amazing!
I can't believe you guys...

1724
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:36,141
are here!

1725
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:37,711
This is so amazing!

1726
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:39,211
Hi.

1727
01:14:41,446 --> 01:14:43,141
Please, no, please, no,
don't kill us.

1728
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:44,366
What happened?

1729
01:14:44,391 --> 01:14:45,735
How do you know Soren?

1730
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:47,805
Is he your boyfriend?

1731
01:14:48,758 --> 01:14:49,930
He's my brother.

1732
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:51,782
I love that piece of shit.

1733
01:14:58,576 --> 01:15:00,099
You guys,
where's everybody else?

1734
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:01,910
Where's your friend
with the sad eyes?

1735
01:15:01,935 --> 01:15:03,138
Sad boy Max?

1736
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,748
In the basement, kissing.

1737
01:15:04,826 --> 01:15:06,420
It's an orgy down there.

1738
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:07,957
You guys aren't into that?

1739
01:15:07,982 --> 01:15:08,888
Mm-mm.

1740
01:15:08,983 --> 01:15:11,356
Aww, it's okay.
You're only in 6th grade.

1741
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,303
You guys are gonna figure it out.

1742
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,990
Yeah, you have your
whole life for that.

1743
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:17,108
No rush, no rush. I mean...

1744
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,537
What do you love?

1745
01:15:19,459 --> 01:15:21,725
Ascension, rules,

1746
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:23,831
antidrug campaigns.

1747
01:15:24,741 --> 01:15:25,749
Grilled cheese.

1748
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:27,651
Oh, I could go for a
grilled cheese right now.

1749
01:15:27,675 --> 01:15:29,323
Oh, there's some mean
makes grilled cheese.

1750
01:15:29,347 --> 01:15:31,042
Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.

1751
01:15:31,253 --> 01:15:33,260
What about you, sleeveless,
what are you into?

1752
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:35,660
I love to sing.

1753
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:36,878
Yes!

1754
01:15:37,964 --> 01:15:40,589
I actually skipped my
audition today for a musical.

1755
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,417
Now, I can't be in it.

1756
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,324
No!

1757
01:15:43,349 --> 01:15:44,111
What?

1758
01:15:44,136 --> 01:15:45,896
You have to convince
him to let you audition.

1759
01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:47,519
You must. You must!

1760
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:49,104
Shh... sing for us.

1761
01:15:49,152 --> 01:15:49,894
No.

1762
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:51,451
Oh, my God, sing for us!

1763
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:52,517
Please sing for us.

1764
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:53,949
So, no grilled cheese?

1765
01:15:54,913 --> 01:15:56,702

My masterpiece.

1815
01:19:50,972 --> 01:19:51,972
Thank you, I was real.

1816
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:53,058
Hello, Max.

1817
01:19:55,272 --> 01:19:56,436
I'll be right back.

1818
01:19:56,631 --> 01:19:58,569
Hey! I didn't think you'd make it.

1819
01:19:58,639 --> 01:19:59,529
Are you kidding?

1820
01:19:59,554 --> 01:20:01,194
You know I'd never
miss one of your shows.

1821
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:03,334
It was so cool when
you stabbed that pimp.

1822
01:20:04,037 --> 01:20:05,037
Thank you.

1823
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,334
Oh, sorry, Thor, this is Scout.

1824
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:08,325
You were really good.

1825
01:20:08,349 --> 01:20:09,161
Thanks, sweetie.

1826
01:20:09,186 --> 01:20:10,857
I was much better
in the matinee.

1827
01:20:12,678 --> 01:20:14,241
I'm gonna go find Cassie.

1828
01:20:16,139 --> 01:20:17,530
I thought you're still grounded.

1829
01:20:17,983 --> 01:20:19,327
It ended yesterday.

1830
01:20:19,413 --> 01:20:20,811
A month in the hole.

1831
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,288
Thanks again for taking the fall.

1832
01:20:23,811 --> 01:20:25,147
You would've done the same.

1833
01:20:25,622 --> 01:20:26,958
Well, well, well,

1834
01:20:26,991 --> 01:20:28,442
look who's here, me!

1835
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:29,817
- Hey!
- Hey!

1836
01:20:31,302 --> 01:20:33,396
Feels like we haven't
talked in weeks.

1837
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,490
Yeah.

1838
01:20:37,185 --> 01:20:38,240
Max.

1839
01:20:38,803 --> 01:20:40,670
My mom said she'll
drop us at frozen yogurt

1840
01:20:40,717 --> 01:20:41,983
if your mom will pick us up.

1841
01:20:42,008 --> 01:20:43,279
Great. Be there
in a second, babe.

1842
01:20:43,303 --> 01:20:44,389
Okay, babe.

1843
01:20:45,233 --> 01:20:47,139
So, how's it going with Scout?

1844
01:20:47,192 --> 01:20:48,192
Good.

1845
01:20:48,225 --> 01:20:49,286
But hard.

1846
01:20:49,365 --> 01:20:50,443
But good.

1847
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:52,569
Our relationship
is a lot of work.

1848
01:20:52,725 --> 01:20:54,483
Don't let anyone
tell you differently.

1849
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:57,358
Hey. Uh, Lucas,

1850
01:20:57,383 --> 01:20:59,436
you still wanna play Ascension
with me and the guys later?

1851
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,592
I'll be there in a minute.

1852
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:02,155
Classic Lucas.

1853
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:06,178
Carlos and those
SCAB guys seem cool.

1854
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:07,788
They're cool.

1855
01:21:08,585 --> 01:21:10,561
But they're not
the Bean Bag Boys.

1856
01:21:13,194 --> 01:21:14,194
Max.

1857
01:21:17,788 --> 01:21:18,881
All right.

1858
01:21:21,694 --> 01:21:23,397
I guess-I guess I should go.

1859
01:21:24,444 --> 01:21:26,741
Yeah, all right. Well...

1860
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:28,858
Yeah.

1861
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,507
I missed you guys.

1862
01:21:55,569 --> 01:21:57,053
Let's make a promise:

1863
01:21:57,366 --> 01:21:59,233
Even if we don't hang
out all the time...

1864
01:21:59,624 --> 01:22:01,546
we'll still always be
there for the big stuff.

1865
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,921
Bean Bag Boys for life.

1866
01:22:05,178 --> 01:22:06,725
Bean Bag Boys for life.

1867
01:22:07,225 --> 01:22:08,936
Bean Bag Boys for life.

1868
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,514
Awooo!

1869
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:20,998
Wait!

1870
01:22:23,225 --> 01:22:24,705
There's something I have to show you.

1871
01:22:24,733 --> 01:22:26,873
Come up to my parent's
bedroom in three minutes.

1872
01:22:31,272 --> 01:22:33,677
Yo, guys, check this out.

1873
01:22:33,702 --> 01:22:35,147
An indoor swing?

1874
01:22:35,202 --> 01:22:36,849
You always have the best toys.

1875
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:38,671
Yeah! Flip that switch.

1876
01:22:41,092 --> 01:22:42,397
How cool is this?

1877
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,405
Your parents love to play.

1878
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,655
What do they do with it?

1879
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:47,085
They swing on it.

1880
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:48,373
Can we go on it?

1881
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:49,421
Fuck yeah.

What are you doing in
Mom and Dad's room?

1888

Get the hell outta

1889
