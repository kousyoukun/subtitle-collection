Want us to put the beer in
a sippy cup for you, Sippy Cup?

170
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:35,952

- THOR: It's not a good burn.

They trashed the place
and took the drone.

That's the most stupid
fucking idea I've ever heard!

Uh, I hope so, madam.

We were using our drone
to follow a family of turtles,

514
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:34,531
and we thought it might have
crashed in your backyard.

515
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,302
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here.
Come on in.

You think I give a fuck
about turtles?

We're sorry. We just wanted
to learn how to kiss.

521
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,251
MAX: Lucas, it's none
of their business.

We should have just
told the truth.

523
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:57,521
We're going to a kissing party,

524
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,622
and none of us have
ever kissed, and we're scared.

525

Goddamn it, Lucas.

526
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:04,761
I've had sex before,
but I've never kissed a girl.

527

Oh.

00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:12,903
It's very easy.

531
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,704
Look, can we please
have the drone back?

532
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,372
It's a BD Rolling Thunder.
It's my dad's.

533
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:18,507
He needs it for work.
Can I please have it back?

534
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,443
- I really need it. Please.
- I don't think so.

535
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:23,446
If you don't give it back,
I'll tell my dad you stole it.

536
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:25,447
And I'll tell him
that you're a pervert.

537

We'll tell the whole school.

538
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:28,484
This is sensual harassment.

539
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,520
We'll tell everyone
that you're a misogynist.

540

I never massaged anyone.

00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:23,786
Are you mocking me?!

633
00:26:23,788 --> 00:26:25,487
Anything will be used
against you

634
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:27,490
- that you say.
- In court.

635
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:28,957
You know, you're the one
holding drugs,

636
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,427
so why don't I do
a citizen's arrest on you?

637
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:32,861
Fuck.

638
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:34,664
Time-out, crackheads.

639
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,198
Oh, my God.

640
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,869
Deal's off. We can't let them
put drugs back on the street.

641
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:41,771
Look at those dirty
fucking junkies.

642
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,572
Their lives are already ruined.

643
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:45,742
Let's just give them the drugs
and get the drone.

644
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:48,878
(sighs)
Maybe there's a way we can

645
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,548
protect our community
and get the drone back.

646
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,515
Stall them.

647
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:57,520
So, what do you plan to do
with those drugs, huh?

648
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,555
Take 'em and feel amazing.

649
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:01,757
(whispers):
They're addicts.

650
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,091
Yeah.

651
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,895
So, you been drugging
your whole life?

652
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:07,930
- Uh-huh.
- E'r'day.

653
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:09,131
Oh. Nice.

654
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,766
What's he doing? Hey.

655
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:13,069
(both gasp)

656
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:15,038
- LUCAS: Yes! Yes!
- MAX: It's working!

657
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,005
- It's working!
- Yes!

658
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:18,608
- THOR: Fly it to the school!
- (both scream)

659
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,176
- You're heading for the trees! Watch out!
- (screaming)

660
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,880
We're gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!

661
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:26,049
(screams)

662
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:27,720
Fuck!

663
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:32,921
(all panting)

664
00:27:32,923 --> 00:27:34,957
Those girls are lucky
I didn't kick their asses.

665
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:37,593
LUCAS:
Oh, no! They found us!

666
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:40,096
- Oh, shit.
- They're on school property.

667
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:42,168
They don't care.
They're tweaking.

668
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:46,569
You know who we need?

669
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:47,870
- No, don't say it.
- THOR: We'll look like losers.

670
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:49,872
- Don't say it. Don't say it.
- SCAB!

671
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:51,107
- THOR: Shut up.
- SCAB!

672
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,809
- Shut up. Zip it.
- MAX: Lucas, shut up.

673
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,610
- SCAB!
- What is that?

674
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:56,044
There's three boys in danger!

675
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:58,881
We're scared!
SCAB, help us!

676
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:00,884
- (blows whistle)
- THOR: We're okay.

677
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:02,551
- We're not scared. We're... we're fine.
- Lucas, shut up.

678
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:04,153
MAX:
Just walking into school.

679
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:05,053
- Average day.
- Jesus Christ.

680
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:06,222
STUDENTS (chanting):
Bullying is wack.

681
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,558
Get on the right track.

682
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,092
Bullying is wack.

683
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:12,829
(slowed, distorted):
Get on the right track.

684
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:15,865
Bullying is wack.

685
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,734
Get on the right track.

686
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:21,140
Bullying is wack.

687
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:28,878
(lisping):
When you attack one of us,

688
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,612
you attack all of us.

689
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,215
Your weakness
gives us strength.

690
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:34,984
- Well, those kids stole my bag.
- Not today, bully!

691
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:37,719
- Not today.
- (scattered laughter)

692
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:39,187
- What the fuck?
- (chanting): Bullying is wack.

693
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,590
Get on the right track.

694
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:43,158
This is the best day
of my life.

695
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,593
Get on the right track.

696
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:46,931
Don't worry,
we'll find them later.

697
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,834
LUCAS: SCAB just tagged us
on Instagram.

698
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:55,204
THOR:
First Sippy Cup, and now this?

699
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:58,006
I'm two weeks into sixth grade,
I'm already a social piranha.

700
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:00,275
Guys, my dad gets back at 5:00.

701
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:02,779
If we don't get a new drone
by then, I'm grounded.

702
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:05,013
Which means we're all grounded,
which means no party,

703
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:06,715
which means no Brixlee.

704
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:09,118
- Sippy Cup for life.
- LUCAS: No Brixlee,

705
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,286
no friends, no hope,

706
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:14,624
parents fighting,
trapped in our rooms,

707
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:17,859
all alone, two Taco Tuesdays.

708
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:21,166
So, Max, what are we gonna do?

709
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:25,834
We're gonna ditch school
and get a new drone.

710
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:27,971
Stop thinking with
your big old dick, Max.

711
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:29,973
That could go on
our permanent record.

712
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,942
Max's big old dick is pointing
us in the right direction.

713
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:35,978
Thank you. If anyone else
kisses Brixlee, I'll die.

714
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,914
Wait, what?
Here's the plan.

715
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,014
I'm gonna bring a beer
to Soren's,

716
00:29:39,016 --> 00:29:41,016
and I'm gonna sip that beer
so everyone will know...

717
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:43,653
LUCAS:
That you're an alcoholic.

718
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:44,887
- That would be great.
- MAX: Guys.

719
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:46,656
The only place around here
that has one

720
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:47,790
is at North Point Galleria.

721
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,224
That's four miles away.

722
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:53,161
Four miles? How the fuck
are we getting four miles?

723
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,830
- You have Uber.
- No, it goes directly

724
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:56,799
to my mom's phone.
She'll know.

725
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:58,400
Then we bike.

726
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:01,272
Where are you even gonna get
the money for a new drone?

727
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,308
- What?
- You know.

728
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,677
Our Turzan of Uzkara card?
No way!

729
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,048
You said everyone wants
to buy it.

730
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,916
- We got it together.
- THOR: And we're gonna

731
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:15,685
sell it together, as friends.

732
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:16,918
MAX:
Come on, Lucas.

733
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,289
Bean Bag Boys
do everything together.

734
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:21,724
Okay.

735
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,426
Guess that makes sense.

736
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:24,293
- Yes!
- Yes!

737
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:27,362
- Lucas! Bean Bag Boys for life.
- Yeah!

738
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,233
We're being so bad.

739
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,069
ALL:
♪ We're bad, we're so bad ♪

740
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:35,303
♪ We're bad,
we're so bad ♪

741
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,742
♪ We're bad, we're so bad. ♪

742
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:43,815
♪ ♪

743
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,823
MAX: I need to get rid
of these drugs.

744
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:57,326
- What are you doing?!
- Getting rid of the drugs!

745
00:30:57,328 --> 00:31:00,096
I'm just gonna throw them
in the stream.

746
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:01,930
It can contaminate the water.

747
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:03,366
Well, then we can throw it
in the forest.

748
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:04,501
It's a sex drug.

749
00:31:04,503 --> 00:31:07,203
What if a fox eats it
and tries to fuck a squirrel?

750
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:08,705
It'll kill him.

751
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:10,305
Well, then how do we
get rid of drugs?

752
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,407
The same way
we get rid of a baby.

753
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:13,709
- Abortion?
- Adoption?

754
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:14,910
No.

755
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,413
We drop it off at the firehouse
on our way up to the mall.

756
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,148
- That's a really good idea.
- (phone buzzing)

757
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,984
Ah. I just got a bite
on our card.

758
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,721
Nice. Give 'em my address.

759
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,822
My parents aren't home,
and I have the best snacks.

760
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:29,358
LUCAS:
PeterPan69 is gonna be here

761
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,293
in five minutes
to buy the card.

762
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:32,762
THOR:
Well, let's get ready.

763
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:34,097
I found all of these weapons

764
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,868
in the back
of my parents' closet.

765
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:42,237
I still don't get
why we need weapons.

766
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,773
He could be a pedophile.

767
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:45,041
He can't molest
all three of us.

768
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,045
All he needs is one.

769
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:53,182
LUCAS:
"An-al beads"?

770
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,984
Aka nunchucks, motherfucker.

771
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:57,219
Ooh.

772
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,856
- Yeah!
- It's not a toy.

773
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:01,189
- (grunts)
- (gasps)

774
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:03,826
- Oh, shoot.
- (Thor groaning)

775
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:06,061
(sniffs)
They smell like shit.

776
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:08,296
(doorbell rings)

777
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:10,268
(door creaks)

778
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:16,539
Hello.
Uh, I'm looking for Lucas.

779
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,175
- That's me.
- I'm Claude.

780
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:20,243
Hey.

781
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:22,811
That's my mom back there.

782
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,382
Hi-ya!

783
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,984
Let's cut the shit.
Are you a pedophile?

784
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:29,417
What? No.

785
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:31,020
Lucas, if you were a pedophile

786
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,554
standing in front
of three single boys,

787
00:32:32,556 --> 00:32:35,057
- would you admit it?
- Probably not.

788
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,292

Do I look like a pedophile?

791
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:40,897
- Sure do.
- Yes, absolutely. - 1,000%.

That's not fair.

- The summer I moved here,

801
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:06,254
me, Max and Thor started
a dog-washing business.

802
00:33:06,256 --> 00:33:08,357
We earned eight bucks,
and we used the money

to buy an Ascension pack,
and this card was in it.

Well, you got very lucky.

- You know why?
- Because you had some beanbags?

No. There's also gonna be

HANNAH: No, we didn't really
know each other then.

you're friends with people
back then

1272

is 'cause you live close

01:03:45,394 --> 01:03:48,294
Now, look, I love a good story
with a bunch of gibberish

1567
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:49,997
just as much as anybody, okay?

1568
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:51,966
And I know you're going through
a stressful time.

1569
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:54,267
But it doesn't give you
a reason to tell us fibs.

1570
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:55,870
I'm not fibbing.

1571
01:03:55,872 --> 01:03:58,104
I'm 100% sure
you're fibbing to me.

1572
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:00,207
- I'm not fibbing.
- Okay. I think I understand

1573
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:01,709
what's happening here.

1574
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:03,711
You think you're losing us,

1575
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:06,213
and now you're worried you're
gonna lose your friends, too.

1576
01:04:06,215 --> 01:04:07,981
DAD:
Look at me, man.

1577
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:09,816
We'll always be there, right?
I mean, and look,

1578
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:10,617
don't get me wrong.
(chuckles)

1579
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:12,119
You know,
me and your mom are not

1580
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:13,720
the same people we were
when we first met.

1581
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:14,921
Mm-hmm.

1582
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:16,256
Tend to grow apart sometimes.

1583
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:17,925
But-but it's okay.

1584
01:04:17,927 --> 01:04:19,225
You remember your hermit crab?

1585
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:21,829
- Herman? Yeah.
- That's right. Herman.

1586
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:24,465
- And you remember why he died?
- Oh, son of a...

1587
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:26,399
You told me he ran away!

1588
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:29,070
Technically, yes,
he ran away, but then he died.

1589
01:04:29,072 --> 01:04:30,370
Oh, my gosh. How?

1590
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:33,039
Herman died
because hermit crabs

1591
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,776
grow out of their shells,
and they need to find

1592
01:04:35,778 --> 01:04:37,745
new, bigger seashells
on the beach

1593
01:04:37,747 --> 01:04:40,314
to grow into, or they die,
and we didn't know that.

1594
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:43,483
So, Herman died
because of you guys?

1595
01:04:43,485 --> 01:04:45,119
The point is...

1596
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:47,220
you and your friends
are growing and changing,

1597
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:49,189
and y'all need to find
bigger shells.

1598
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:51,225
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

1599
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:53,359
DAD (voice fading):
Okay, look, you need to blame

1600
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,829
those pet store owners, okay,
because they did not give us

1601
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:58,134
the information
about hermit crabs...

1602
01:04:59,367 --> 01:05:01,371
♪ ♪

LUCAS:
It's Lucas.

1606
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,483
MAX:
You scared the shit out of me.

1607
01:05:16,485 --> 01:05:19,887
LUCAS: I didn't want
your parents to see my face.

1608
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:21,888
Why are you even here?

1609
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,890
I've grown a lot
in the last two hours.

1610
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:25,526
My parents' divorce
has really changed me.

1611
01:05:25,528 --> 01:05:27,294
If the Bean Bag Boys
don't grow together,

1612
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:29,095
they'll grow apart.

1613
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:30,830
I don't want that.

1614
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:33,399
I don't want to get
a divorce from you.

1615
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,535
Then you need to go
to Soren's party.

1616
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:38,338
- You need to sneak out.
- I can't. I'm grounded.

1617
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,975
Besides, Brixlee's necklace
is still in the kiln.

1618
01:05:40,977 --> 01:05:43,343
Let me worry about
the necklace.

1619
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:45,347
And what are your parents
gonna do, double-ground you?

1620
01:05:46,948 --> 01:05:49,251
Is Brixlee your forever or not?

1621
01:05:50,986 --> 01:05:53,086
Then you need to come
with me now.

1622
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:56,256
Fine, I'll go, but I'm not
apologizing to Thor.

1623
01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:59,225
- He's not coming.
- Good.

1624
01:05:59,227 --> 01:06:01,227
Fuck that bitch.

1625
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:03,530
I'll go get my jacket.

1626
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:05,999
- Hey, Max.
- Yeah?

1627
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:07,837
Bring that dick.

1628
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,910
(sighs)
You said Thor wasn't coming.

1629
01:06:16,912 --> 01:06:18,245
What the hell is he doing here?

1630
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:19,280
LUCAS:
I Parent-Trapped your asses.

1631
01:06:19,282 --> 01:06:20,548
See, now we're all in

1632
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,419
a bigger hermit crab shell
together.

1633
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:25,852
It made sense
when my parents said it.

1634
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,854
So, you took the blame
for us, huh?

1635
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:29,356
MAX:
Yeah. I thought about

1636
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,392
what you would do,
and did the opposite.

1637
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:34,894
This party, it's gonna be
an epic rager.

Hi.

1658
01:07:33,322 --> 01:07:35,455
It's nice to finally meet you.

1659
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:36,923
You, too.

Cool jacket.

01:07:38,628 --> 01:07:40,327
Thank you.

1662
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:43,430
I got it all by myself,
with my mom.

1663
01:07:43,432 --> 01:07:46,200
I go shopping with my mom, too.

1664
01:07:46,202 --> 01:07:48,371
This is going so well.

1665

Brixlee, this is for you.

1667

Oh, thanks. It's pretty.

1668
01:07:58,947 --> 01:08:00,113
They're an-al.

1669
01:08:00,115 --> 01:08:01,414
Ooh, fancy.

What's up, Sippy Cup?

1674
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,959
Not much.

1675
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:14,561
Just, uh, got into a fight

1676
01:08:14,563 --> 01:08:18,132
with a bunch of men
and, uh, stole a beer.

01:08:18,134 --> 01:08:21,168
There's no way Sippy Cup
is gonna drink it.

01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,503
Not only am I gonna drink it,

1679
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:26,205
- I'm gonna break the record.
- (kids gasping, chuckling)

1680
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:29,476
I'm gonna take four sips.

Four is impossible.

1682
01:08:31,112 --> 01:08:33,379
- Soren can't even do four.
- SOREN: Shut up.

1683
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:35,919
Drink.

Four sips. Badass.

Eyes up here.

01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:49,489
If you don't consent
to kissing, that's cool.

1711
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:51,557
You can go play VR upstairs.

1712

But if you're staying
down here,

1713
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:54,595
you better strap in,

1714
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:56,430
because shit's about
to get real.

1715
