1
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,580
選擇角色

2
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,260
捏人

3
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,500
太他媽棒了

4
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,870
你幹嘛把門關了  馬克西

5
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,520
爸爸  我六年級了
我有時候需要點  隱私

6
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,000
好吧  我要去機場了

7
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,180
兩天後回來

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,130
對你姐姐好一點

9
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,120
幫媽媽做點事

10
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,520
還有別碰無人機

11
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,020
我不碰  拜拜

12
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
我是認真的  那不是玩具
是我工作用的

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,010
知道了  一路順風  再見爸爸  愛你

14
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,150
謝了  來抱一下  小子

15
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,040
等你回來了我抱你兩下

16
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,620
我懂了

17
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,070
你笑什麼

18
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,890
你長大了

19
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,260
我很高興

20
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,820
不是  別笑了

21
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,030
我還記得從醫院把你抱回家的時候

22
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,430
就像是昨天

23
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,060
而現在你

24
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,010
已經開始手淫了

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,390
我沒  我不是

26
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,720
沒事啊  小傻瓜

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,230
就像你有了新玩具

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,870
世上最好的玩具

29
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,720
你只是想一直玩它

30
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,340
我只想讓你知道  我為你自豪

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,060
好了  做你的事吧  再見

32
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,720
愛你  兩天後見

33
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,040
艾米

34
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,000
你絕對不會相信

35
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,480
《好小子們》

36
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,120
兄弟們  知道嗎

37
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,620
我保姆告訴我

38
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,800
六年級所有人都打手槍

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,270
什麼是打手槍

40
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,970
就是姑娘給你擼到射

41
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,710
然後你要自己收拾乾淨

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,350
-我不覺得那叫"舍"
-沒錯的  "ㄕㄜ"  射

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,450
中學可比小學刺激的多

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,600
如果想平安渡過

45
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,020
我們必須團結一心

46
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,050
豆袋男孩一輩子

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,510
注意減速帶

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,990
你朋友是不是嫉妒你
在和大學男生談戀愛

49
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,340
-有些人嫉妒吧  -是嗎

50
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,460
你們在幹嘛

51
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,850
目不斜視  目不斜視

52
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,940
怪奇物語裡的小屁孩們  趕緊滾蛋

53
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,540
好吧  快走快走

54
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,940
你認識這些小屁孩嗎

55
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:53,980
暗殺神卡牌
你認識這些小屁孩嗎

56
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,250
暗殺神卡牌

57
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,990
沒有人能頂得住烏茲卡的屠爾贊
暗殺神卡牌

58
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,200
暗殺神卡牌

59
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,010
盧卡斯  別把它拿出來呀

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,600
兄弟  它值300美元

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,190
600了現在  我查過

62
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,140
600美元

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,910
-我們是百萬富翁了  -是啊

64
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,050
你們想不想

65
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,200
明天放學後去滑板場

66
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,840
我知道什麼是古柯鹼

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,170
安娜貝爾  出去

68
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,370
這裡僅限豆袋男孩

69
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,160
我聽說滑板場裡

70
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,350
那些大孩子會叫你吸毒

71
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,790
我們絕不吸毒

72
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,640
毒品毀了生命和社區

73
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,220
你沒有選擇

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,780
媽媽

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,170
安娜貝爾  別惹你哥哥了

76
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,380
走  上樓

77
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,640
快點

78
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,790
好了  豆袋男孩  收拾收拾吧

79
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,210
明天還要上學  8:30熄燈

80
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,900
什麼  你之前說是8:45

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,380
趕緊收拾吧

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,080
我不覺得我想去滑板場

83
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,630
我們現在六年級了

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,700
我們要開始做六年級該做的事了

85
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,890
你是不是想見布希麗

86
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,020
《Valentine》——YK Osiris

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,000
*你是否願意屬於我*

88
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,650
*是否想要我的心*

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,180
*你是否願意屬於我*

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,400
*女孩  成為我的情人*

91
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,260
我的天

92
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,170
媽

93
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,500
這公園真他媽的棒

94
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,930
你們快看  滑板車小分隊在呢

95
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,370
你們知道誰真的擅長嘲諷嗎

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,030
阿提卡斯·L  他很有趣

97
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,570
阿提卡斯·L

98
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,250
我和他對嘲的時候他屁話不敢說

99
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,120
對吧  馬克西

100
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,840
*但我需要你女孩  我得到了你*

101
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,590
*但你得到我了嗎*

102
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,560
*寶貝我在乎你*

103
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,800
所以呢

104
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,680
你要不要把你
為布希麗做的項鏈送給她

105
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,950
不要  閉嘴

106
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,280
我還沒有放進窯裡燒製呢

107
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,960
你總有藉口

108
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,350
索爾  你從來不和女生說話

109
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,970
女生會讓人分心

110
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,200
《搖滾時代》兩天後要試演了

111
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,510
*而我不想被束縛*

112
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,050
馬克西  過來

113
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
泰勒

114
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,990
大家都在說你在美術課上
給布希麗做了項鏈

115
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,560
得了吧  在我的美術作品完成之前

116
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,780
我不想討論

117
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,890
如果她對你有意思

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,640
你會承認你喜歡她嗎

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,930
她對我有意思嗎

120
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,100
不知道

121
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,750
我沒問過她

122
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,870
明天見

123
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,440
再見

124
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,870
該死

125
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,000
怎麼樣啊  戀愛中的男孩

126
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,540
她可能知道了項鏈的事

127
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,130
晚餐吃素菜千層麵

128
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,020
一切可真美好呢  盧卡斯

129
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,580
我們學校見

130
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
待會見

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,220
注意安全

132
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,060
滑板車男孩  滑板車男孩來了

133
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,170
酷一點

134
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,560
酷一點

135
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,590
有事嗎  阿提卡斯

136
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,250
你們想看看很酷的東西嗎

137
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
當然

138
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,130
我們要幹什麼  要做什麼

139
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,790
我們要喝口啤的呀

140
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,630
怕了嗎

141
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
不怕

142
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,610
我喝過大概五千口啤酒了

143
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,870
窩囊廢  拜託

144
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,830
索仁是紀錄保持者

145
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
三口

146
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,130
三口嗎

147
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,410
三口

148
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,820
有點上頭了

149
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
好喝

150
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,760
當心  很辣的

151
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,290
你到底喝不喝

152
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,060
我忘了  這週五我有音樂劇試演

153
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,520
他們要酒精測試的

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,140
索爾  就承認你害怕了吧  小屁孩

155
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,490
我才沒有

156
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,080
要不要我把啤酒
倒在奶嘴杯裡給你喝啊

157
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,090
奶嘴杯

158
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,050
不

159
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,990
奶嘴杯

160
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,360
好嘲諷  阿提卡斯

161
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,640
這不是好嘲諷

162
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,870
他爸爸被查到兩次酒駕

163
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,290
現在不得不坐火車上班

164
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,580
這才是好嘲諷

165
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,730
奶嘴寶貝  給我們唱首歌吧

166
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,630
不

167
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,810
不如

168
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,810
一閃一閃小窩囊

169
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,970
奶嘴寶貝

170
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
奶嘴寶貝

171
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,970
朋友們  他會喝的

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
他只是需要點時間考慮

173
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,750
奶嘴寶貝  奶嘴寶貝

174
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
再見

175
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,980
千層麵配汽水

176
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,370
別告訴我爸媽你們給我吃這些哦

177
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,390
這孩子可真搞笑

178
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,510
我們準備離婚了

179
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,960
什麼意思

180
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,590
別擔心  什麼都不會變的

181
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,610
我們保證

182
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,300
我們還會一起看
《我們這一天》嗎

183
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,400
當然  那是我們最喜歡的美劇

184
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,710
那是屬於我們家的美劇

185
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,410
除了一點
你會在兩個不同的電視上看

186
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,630
在兩個不同的屋子裡

187
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,380
所以你要每集看兩遍

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
那每週二的塔可呢

189
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,120
每週二的塔可還是依舊

190
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,000
事實上  你會有兩次每週二塔可  只是

191
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,610
有一個在週三

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,050
兩次快樂

193
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
雙倍快樂  雙倍塔可

194
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,610
所以  什麼都不會變的

195
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,030
我和你媽媽  我們還是朋友  對吧

196
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,250
我是說  作為家人一起吃塔可也很好

197
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,010
只是以後不得不換成週三了

198
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,120
*我漫步在陽光下*
《Walkin' on Sunshine》——Katrina

199
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,870
*陽光下*

200
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,100
*那感覺不是很好嗎*

201
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,750
*現在我每次走去信箱*

202
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,760
*我要盡力控制我自己*

203
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,260
*因為我等不及你寫信給我*

204
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,190
*你要來到我身邊*

205
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,910
索爾  優秀  天使的歌喉啊你

206
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,200
*我漫步在陽光下*

207
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,620
*我漫步在陽光下*

208
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,110
*漫步在陽光下*

209
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,330
我們在哪裡漫步

210
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,280
*漫步在*

211
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,620
*陽光下*

212
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,680
*那感覺不是很好嗎*

213
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,530
那感覺是很好  不是嘛

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,930
怎麼了

215
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,790
這歌我總是聽著傷心

216
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,040
別忘了

217
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,050
《搖滾時代》試演就在明天

218
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,710
這是我最喜歡的音樂劇

219
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,330
我做了一些大的調整

220
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,270
是根據我在怪萊塢的經驗
重金屬搖滾圈對好萊塢的戲稱

221
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,800
我想這會激勵

222
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,820
你們這些敢於夢想的人

223
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,230
太棒了

224
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,700
我看向她  但她在看其他方向

225
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,250
然後她看向了我

226
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,910
我又看其他方向

227
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,150
所以我想總有一天
我們會有眼神交流的

228
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,430
那很棒

229
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,020
這音樂劇會很讚

230
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,110
索仁  看啊

231
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,660
奶嘴寶貝在報名音樂劇

232
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
過分用力的人才會去唱歌

233
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,780
不是  是有人開玩笑報了我名字

234
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,770
我正準備劃掉的  看到沒

235
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,220
是啊  隨便了  窩囊廢

236
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,230
夠了

237
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,500
我們走

238
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,230
我還有地方要去呢

239
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,370
抱歉  索仁

240
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
別管阿提卡斯說什麼

241
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,740
他爸爸都不會報稅

242
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,740
這和阿提卡斯沒關係

243
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,500
從很小的時候

244
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,840
我一直想放棄唱歌

245
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,290
走了  我們要錯過魚排了

246
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,660
這是我見過最好的午餐

247
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,870
是啊  我爸媽現在變得超好  因為

248
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,300
因為

249
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,150
他們很好

250
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,420
他們很好  一切都好

251
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,870
那是新的耳釘嗎

252
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,410
是的  終於啊  感覺你的關注

253
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,540
你戴著很可愛

254
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,870
馬克西  我不喜歡可愛
我喜歡性感火辣

255
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,220
那是唯二我想要的

256
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,290
你喜歡嗎

257
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,100
你耳洞看起來感染了

258
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,140
在此排隊取餐

259
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,420
索仁太酷了
在此排隊取餐

260
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,460
索仁太酷了

261
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,430
我聽說他痛打了德里克·巴哈曼
還讓他姐姐給他吹簫

262
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,070
他讓自己姐姐給他吹簫

263
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,540
不是  他讓德里克的姐姐給他吹簫

264
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,310
太他媽的傳奇了

265
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,040
我覺得索仁在叫我

266
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,210
有事

267
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,270
好

268
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,120
我聽說你喝啤酒很猛啊

269
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,500
我喝了挺大一口呢

270
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,220
不賴

271
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,330
明天晚上我要開個派對

272
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,090
這些傢伙們都會來

273
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,710
你來嗎

274
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,140
你應該來哦

275
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,640
相信我

276
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,070
好  我來

277
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,430
但是你懂的  我得先問我媽

278
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,550
補充一下  會是個熱吻派對哦

279
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,370
你法式深吻過女孩的  對吧

280
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,590
那當然了

281
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,660
親的哪

282
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,240
嘴唄

283
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,950
沒錯  老鐵

284
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,720
他不會就開始跟那些
受歡迎的小孩們一桌了吧

285
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,150
不會  我才是該去那桌的人

286
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,000
我們聽說大家叫你"奶嘴寶貝"

287
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,420
我們就是想讓你知道你可以

288
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,290
找學生反校園霸凌聯盟尋求保護

289
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,780
這個看著像奶瓶嗎

290
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,370
不啊

291
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,210
因為這他媽是盒果汁

292
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,280
因為我他媽不是小孩

293
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,860
太兇了吧

294
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,590
我能帶索爾和盧卡斯一起去嗎

295
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,350
他們也太遜了

296
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,400
不不  他們挺酷的

297
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,710
我是想保持男女人數平衡

298
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,700
懂我意思嗎  老鐵

299
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,030
明白  老鐵  但是

300
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,140
他們是我最好的朋友
我們幹什麼都一起的

301
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,080
我們是豆袋男孩

302
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,200
這名字還挺酷的

303
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,960
得了  帶他們來

304
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,230
我可以讓他們和我兄弟們一起玩

305
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,980
問好了你媽媽
記得告訴我一聲昂  老鐵

306
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,020
好的  待會見老鐵  拜老鐵們

307
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,960
怎麼樣

308
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,970
索仁請我們去參加他的派對

309
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,860
-索仁嗎  -對啊

310
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,250
他說了我的名字嗎
他說要請"索爾"

311
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,700
差不多吧

312
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,110
棒欸

313
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,600
對了  到時候會有女孩在哦

314
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,810
你明白什麼意思吧

315
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,430
狗血唄

316
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,290
接吻啊

317
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,360
所以

318
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,610
你們知道怎麼接吻嗎

319
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,590
-我沒經驗啊  -不知道

320
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,910
輸入"接吻"

321
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,690
不不  輸入"胸"

322
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,300
"乳腺癌研究"

323
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,310
"如何選對合適的內衣"

324
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,540
我有主意了

325
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,760
色情片

326
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,680
"你是否年滿18歲?"

327
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,090
我要點是

328
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,590
我們才沒滿18

329
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,890
這會成為我們的永久性記錄的

330
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,550
"我是你繼母

331
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,730
你不該看我洗澡的"

332
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,630
"別跟我爸說  他會叫我退出運動隊的"

333
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,560
"起來

334
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,940
起來"

335
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,330
他有麻煩了

336
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,130
"我要好好懲罰你

337
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,400
把短褲脫了"

338
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,500
有了繼母會發生這種事嗎

339
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,160
那不可能放得進去啊

340
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,490
快跑啊女孩

341
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,850
他手往哪放呢

342
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,220
我的老天爺啊

343
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,960
他們都沒接吻呢

344
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,280
是啊  反正嘴沒親

345
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,580
我爸媽有個練心肺復甦用的娃娃

346
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,200
我們可以用它練

347
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,030
來吧

348
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,030
這個心肺復甦娃娃長得好好看啊

349
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,770
那我先來囉

350
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,660
等一下

351
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,260
你在幹嘛

352
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,310
親她啊

353
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,670
沒經過本人允許不能隨便親別人

354
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,430
這可是開會說過的啊

355
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,720
假裝它是布希麗

356
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,850
紳士一點

357
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
好吧

358
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,650
布希麗  我能吻你嗎

359
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,200
為什麼呢

360
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,640
為什麼

361
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,600
對啊  你喜歡我哪一點

362
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,790
這個嘛

363
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,950
你很可愛

364
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,470
你聞起來香香的

365
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,580
你也很聰明

366
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,100
你總是推著亨利坐著輪椅散步

367
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,550
儘管他超刻薄的

368
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,800
當我以為自己已經
很瞭解你的時候

369
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,060
卻發現你還會玩滑板

370
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,810
我同意了

371
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,320
什麼感覺

372
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,300
黏黏的

373
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,810
她嘴裡為什麼有毛

374
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,050
知道嗎  這樣咱們學不到什麼東西

375
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,570
我們需要看真人怎麼接吻的

376
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,980
那是唯一能知道我們
親沒親對的辦法

377
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,550
我鄰居是個十足的色情狂

378
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,310
她總是換男朋友

379
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,940
她總放火嗎

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
不  你說的那是縱火狂

381
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,290
我說的是色情狂

382
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,850
無論哪裡都能做愛的人

383
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,160
真的嗎

384
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,350
我本來想明天再給你驚喜的

385
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,680
但我實在忍不到明天再說了

386
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,780
不用啊  又沒什麼事

387
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,280
不不  你一定想知道

388
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,170
我什麼都看不見啊

389
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,770
我知道自從我遇見本吉之後

390
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,280
咱們就沒怎麼在一起玩了

391
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,600
但是我想彌補你

392
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,040
所以明天  我要翹一天課

393
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,130
咱們開車到市區

394
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,400
去看肯德里克·拉馬爾的演唱會

395
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,220
沒開玩笑吧

396
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,410
我們還要吸茉莉[毒品]哦

397
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,690
你想的太周到了

398
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,580
那當然了  會很棒的

399
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,240
姑娘們

400
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,350
本吉幫我們搞到的茉莉

401
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,690
班傑明

402
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,020
謝啦

403
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,580
聽著

404
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,520
這不管用

405
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,550
興許我們應該去爬個樹

406
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,520
不行  他們會看見的

407
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,640
不是  我就是說
要不咱們爬個樹玩

408
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,070
哥們  等等

409
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,250
我有個辦法可以看到他們接吻

410
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,820
BD雷霆無人機

411
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,780
不行

412
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,430
它有攝影機

413
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,510
我們什麼都能看見
咱可以學技術啊

414
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,140
那是他爸爸工作用的
不是個玩具

415
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,530
當然是玩具

416
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,070
玩具店都有賣的

417
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,060
我叔叔在部隊裡飛無人機

418
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,140
現在他晚上睡覺
都會大吼大叫還總是狂拉肚子

419
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,310
他把這個留在家裡簡直是瘋了

420
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,470
你每天從它跟前過

421
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,130
-他在折磨你  -沒錯

422
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,090
就像你表姐

423
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,170
穿著比基尼走來走去還嘲笑你

424
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,190
如果他發現了  你會被關禁閉的

425
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,850
你就去不了索仁的派對了

426
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,590
更糟糕的是
你會失去你爸爸的信任

427
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,630
這也沒錯

428
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,390
她會愛上真實的你的

429
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,020
沒錯  但是吻功超爛

430
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,410
記得剛才的毛騙嗎

431
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,790
那個男的甚至都不會接吻

432
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,790
他只會舔那個女人的屁股

433
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,550
你想親別人的屁股嗎  馬克西

434
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:18,990
不想

435
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,790
馬克西  別聽他的

436
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,650
他只是因為沉迷於那些
受歡迎的小孩才想去的

437
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,810
馬克西  相信我

438
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,810
你不想還不會接吻
就去索仁的派對的

439
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,730
明天你們閨蜜時間結束之後

440
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,130
要不要來我這來點男人時光啊

441
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,470
我跟你說過了
這週末我要跟莉莉過

442
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,690
我知道  只是

443
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,070
見不到你我很難過的

444
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,590
因為你是我最好的朋友

445
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,490
但是莉莉是我最好的朋友

446
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,770
明白  完全瞭解

447
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,310
要不我跟我前女友瑪格麗特待會

448
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,210
你是想讓我嫉妒嗎

449
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,390
不是啊  你會嫉妒嗎

450
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,370
會的  這樣下去不行

451
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,730
我知道  你不夠辣
沒資格這麼作

452
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,990
所以下次你奇怪

453
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,010
好男人都去哪了的時候

454
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,150
記住這次
你讓一個好男人離開你了

455
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,230
你說什麼

456
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,930
我沒說話

457
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,070
我再也不想見到你了

458
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,650
你沒事吧

459
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,930
那男的去哪了

460
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,010
管他呢  兩個女孩擁抱呢

461
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,150
她們一定會接吻的

462
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,830
我們要不離近點

463
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,830
那是什麼

464
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,070
它在偷窺我們

465
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,150
-行了  輪到我了  -拿來

466
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,410
-她們發現你了  -不要

467
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,510
你會摔壞它的

468
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,830
你想要  好

469
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,610
接住了

470
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,630
不

471
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,650
該死

472
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,730
什麼鬼  索爾

473
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,010
咱倆都有錯

474
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,290
我爸會殺了我的  怎麼辦

475
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,090
我們就說有人入室搶劫

476
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,250
砸了家搶了無人機

477
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,710
那是我聽過最他媽蠢的注意了

478
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,950
夥伴們  夥伴們

479
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,690
我們只要說出真相就好了

480
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,390
上帝會站在我們這邊的

481
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,090
你們好丫  需要幫忙嗎

482
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,650
希望可以  女士

483
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,110
我們用無人機
跟著一家小烏龜來著

484
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,750
然後好像把無人機
掉在你家後院了

485
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,750
是呢  在我家  進來吧

486
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,150
你們喜歡小烏龜

487
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,830
-是啊  -那很好啊

488
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,450
別演了  賤人們

489
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,510
該死  是個圈套

490
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,450
你覺得我他媽在乎烏龜嗎

491
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,530
對不起
我們就是想學怎麼接吻

492
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,490
盧卡斯
那跟她們沒有關係

493
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,890
我們應該實話實說

494
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,290
我們要去一個熱吻派對

495
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,450
但是我們都不會接吻
我們可害怕了

496
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,070
老天爺啊  盧卡斯

497
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,790
我已經做過愛了

498
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,030
但是我沒親過女孩

499
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,690
就上網搜索"如何接吻"不行嗎

500
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,370
大家都這麼幹啊

501
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,630
簡單的很啊

502
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,390
求你們了
我們能把無人機拿回去嗎

503
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,050
那是BD雷霆無人機

504
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,610
是我爸爸的  他工作要用的

505
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,590
求你們還給我吧

506
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,930
我真的需要拿回去  求你們了

507
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,450
我覺得不行

508
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,790
你們要是不還我
我就告訴我爸你們偷走的

509
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,270
那我就告訴他你是個變態

510
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,450
我還要告訴全校的人

511
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,090
這是性騷擾

512
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,410
我會告訴所有人你有厭女症

513
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,250
我才沒給別人按摩[同音]過呢

514
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,410
這就是你不尊重女人的後果

515
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,370
我尊重女人啊
我媽媽是我最好的朋友

516
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,710
那我呢

517
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,790
我完蛋了

518
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,430
我爸會殺了我的

519
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,030
誰讓你非得偷窺她們
你個女權主義者

520
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,910
我不是女權主義者
我愛女人

521
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,450
我爸媽一定會給
你們的爸媽打電話的

522
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,550
我們都會被關禁閉的

523
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,410
更別想去索仁的派對了
我們完蛋了

524
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,070
你笑什麼  這明明就是你的錯

525
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,150
這是籌碼

526
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,930
沒錯

527
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,490
這是什麼

528
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,810
我也不知道

529
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,230
這是衛生棉條

530
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,390
幹嘛的

531
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,110
女生們害怕生出孩子
就拿來塞進屁眼裡

532
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,790
一個八年級的告訴我的

533
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,650
人類的身體構造真是個謎

534
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,290
兒童維他命咀嚼片

535
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,610
他們居然還在吃咀嚼片
兒童維他命咀嚼片

536
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:23,870
他們居然還在吃咀嚼片

537
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,390
軟糖好吃多了

538
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,790
我就喜歡吃咀嚼片

539
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,810
給我來一片

540
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,230
去他媽的防孩童瓶蓋

541
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,290
索爾  索爾

542
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,020
莉莉

543
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,630
那兩個女孩打來的

544
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:56,930
你好

545
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,290
你們偷了我的包
裡面有駕照  手機

546
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,110
馬上給老娘還回來

547
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,330
你他媽別吵

548
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,910
先把我的無人機還給我

549
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,490
讓我來  讓我來

550
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,630
你剛剛說什麼呢  小賤人

551
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,990
你要敢不聽話
我讓你吃不了兜著走

552
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,370
你為什麼這麼說話

553
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,990
漢娜  我可是有弟弟的人

554
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,350
這樣才嚇得住他們

555
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,830
你把我嚇個半死

556
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,190
聽著  我們只是想給你們個教訓

557
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,730
我保證會把無人機還你

558
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,370
不可能  她們還會騙我們的

559
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,090
或者直接制服我們

560
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,850
天啊  他們要是吃了茉莉怎麼辦

561
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,650
他們不可能打開的

562
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,810
他們還是小屁孩  吃了會死的

563
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,690
還是我  馬克西

564
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,290
你們到約翰·亞當斯雕像
對面的遊樂場來

565
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,510
明早7點40

566
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,390
拿上無人機

567
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,350
可別想糊弄我們豆袋男孩

568
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,150
很強硬

569
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,590
相當強硬

570
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,570
面對強硬的人就得更強硬

571
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,650
我們還沒掛斷呢

572
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,190
我靠

573
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,650
快掛斷

574
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,530
別再靠近了

575
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:27,950
為什麼

576
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,630
因為你們能制服住我們

577
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,450
把無人機放到滑梯上

578
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,170
然後把眼睛閉上  從100開始倒數

579
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,290
別想玩什麼小把戲

580
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,990
大伙都看著呢

581
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,230
臭小子  我們還要出遠門

582
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,490
趕緊把包還來  不然有你們好看

583
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,730
不要考驗我的耐心

584
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,590
威脅我們可對你沒好處  賤民

585
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,490
他媽的趕緊把茉莉還給我們

586
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,030
茉莉是誰  我們沒見過她

587
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,550
弟兄們  茉莉是春藥的名字

588
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,250
新聞頭條報導過

589
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,810
你們居然讓我們
把毒品帶到遊樂場來

590
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,690
這裡到處都是小孩

591
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,130
沒事  我知道該怎麼做

592
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:07,750
我們現在要進行公民逮捕

593
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,610
我們現在要進行公民逮捕

594
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,810
你們現在被逮捕了

595
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,210
-蹲下  -我的天啊

596
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,150
-把手舉起來  -不准動  舉起手來

597
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,750
-不准動  -舉起手來

598
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,850
快蹲下

599
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,310
蹲下

600
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,090
你剛剛是給你的假槍裝彈了嗎

601
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,430
你在嘲諷我嗎  你是在嘲諷我嗎

602
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,710
你現在說的每句話
都可能作為你的證詞

603
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,450
呈堂證供

604
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,090
你知道嗎
你們現在才是藏了藥的人

605
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,570
所以為什麼我
不對你們進行公民逮捕呢

606
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,670
靠

607
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,730
時間到了  癮君子

608
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,990
我的天啊

609
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,310
交易取消

610
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,610
我們不能再讓她們
拿著藥為非作歹

611
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,870
看看那些癮君子

612
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,490
她們的一生已經毀掉了啊

613
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,710
把藥給她們吧  然後拿回無人機

614
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,330
也許有個辦法可以保護社區

615
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,670
還能讓我們拿回無人機

616
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,530
先拖住她們

617
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,370
所以你們準備拿這藥幹嘛呢

618
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,230
吃啊

619
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,730
然後欲仙欲死

620
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,170
她們就是癮君子

621
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,190
沒錯

622
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,150
所以你們一輩子都在嗑藥嗎

623
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,950
每天如此

624
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,350
很好

625
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,890
你幹嘛呢

626
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,530
成功了

627
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,790
衝啊

628
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,750
我靠

629
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,250
算她們走運
我沒把她們打得屁滾尿流

630
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,470
天啊  她們找過來了

631
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,590
我靠

632
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,350
她們現在可是在學校裡呢

633
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,270
她們才不會管這麼多
她們磕嗨了

634
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,330
你們知道我們需要怎麼做嗎

635
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,890
別說出來  別說出來

636
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,070

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,650
這太瘋狂了

645
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,890
校園霸凌  惡中之惡

646

放下屠刀  回頭是岸

647
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,130
校園霸凌  惡中之惡

648
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,090
只要你傷害我們其中任何一員

649
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,590
你就是在傷害我們所有人

650
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,110
你的軟弱就是我們的力量之源

651
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,490
那幾個小屁孩偷了我的包

652
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,110
今天決不允許校園霸凌的發生

653
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,410
今天決不允許

654
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,910
-什麼鬼  -校園霸凌  惡中之惡

656
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,190
今天可真是我人生中
最有意思的一天

657
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,990
放下屠刀  回頭是岸

658
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,930
別擔心  之後再找他們算帳

659
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,310
反霸凌聯盟
剛剛在微博上圈了我們

660
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,090
先是被叫奶嘴寶貝
現在又搞這麼一齣

661
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,310
還有兩週我就六年級了

662
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,050
可現在社會人
所有人對我避之不及

663
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,390
弟兄們  我爸爸五點就回來了

664
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,990
如果我們不能在這之前
搞到一台新的無人機

665
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,830
我會被禁足的

666
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,210
也就是說我們都會被禁足
派對泡湯

667
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,670
也就親不到布希麗了

668
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,210
這輩子都被叫奶嘴寶貝

669
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,330
失去布希麗  失去朋友

670
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,870
失去希望  爸媽冷戰

671
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,750
被困在房間裡  孤獨終老

672
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,710
在週二吃兩份墨西哥捲餅

673
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,510
所以  馬克西
我們接下來怎麼做

674
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,230
我們要把課翹了

675
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,130
去搞一台新的無人機

676
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,370
別只會用你的大屌思考  馬克西

677
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,170
我們會被記過的  一輩子的汙點

678
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,710
馬克西的大屌
給我們指了一條明路

679
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,810
謝謝

680
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,150
如果其他人親了布希麗
我會死的

681
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,050
等等

682
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,030
我們應該這麼行動

683
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,430
我會拿瓶啤酒給索仁

684
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,650
然後我會喝一口
這樣所有人都知道

685
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,370
你是個酒鬼

686
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,330
那才棒呢

687
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,250
兄弟們  這附近唯一
賣那個無人機的地方

688
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,830
在北角免稅購物廣場

689
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,250
有6.4公里遠

690
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,310
6.4公里

691
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,130
我們他媽要怎麼過去

692
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,050
我們可以打滴滴

693
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,970
不行  這樣的話我媽媽會收到簡訊

694
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,210
她就會知道了

695
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,810
那我們騎自行車去

696
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,630
但是你哪來錢買一台新的

697
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,370
怎麼了

698
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,650
你懂的

699
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,290
我們那張烏茲卡屠爾贊的牌嗎

700
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,710
不可能

701
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,690
你說過是個人都想買我們的牌

702
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,050
那是我們的共同財產

703
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,530
作為朋友  那我們就一起賣出去

704
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,710
求你了  盧卡斯

705
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,790
豆袋男孩應該同舟共濟

706
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,430
好吧  你說的沒錯

707
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,490
-太好了
-太好了

708
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,590
盧卡斯

709
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,650
-豆袋男孩要一輩子在一起
-對

710
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,690
我們真壞

711
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,990
我們真壞  我們真壞

712
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,150
我們真壞  我們真壞

713
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,490
我們真壞  我們真壞

714
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,390
我得把這藥扔了

715
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,430
你要幹嘛

716
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,720
把它扔了

717
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,740
我要把它扔進小溪裡

718
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,550
溪水會被汙染的

719
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,130
那我們就扔在森林裡

720
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,490
這可是春藥啊

721
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,190
如果一隻狐狸
吃了想操松鼠怎麼辦

722
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,310
它會死的

723
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,470
那我們要怎樣處理這些藥

724
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,430
就像我們怎麼處置嬰兒一樣

725
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,770
-打掉  -領養

726
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,990
不是

727
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,650
在我們去商場的路上
順便扔到消防隊門口

728
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,370
這主意不錯

729
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,090
有人要買我們的卡了

730
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,450
把我家地址給他們

731
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,090
我爸媽不在家
而且我家零食可好吃了

732
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,770
英雄之褲69
五分鐘之內就會到

733
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,490
我們準備一下

734
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,210
我在我爸媽衣櫃最深處

735
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,970
找到了所有這些武器

736
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,260
我還是搞不懂你為什麼需要武器

737
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,540
他可能是個戀童癖

738
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,320
他不可能對我們三個同時下手

739
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,680
他只用搞定一個

740
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,250
Anal beads  肛珠  成人性玩具

741
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,700
這是個什麼
Anal beads  肛珠  成人性玩具

742
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:51,830
這是個什麼

743
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,290
快使用雙節棍  哼哼哈嘿

744
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,950
-真厲害
-這可不是玩具

745
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,250
打到了吧

746
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,810
怎麼聞著有股屎味

747
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,830
你好  我找盧卡斯

748
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,770
我就是

749
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,920
我叫克勞德

750
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,410
你好

751
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,440
我媽坐在那裡

752
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
你好

753
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,390
那我們廢話少說
你是戀童癖嗎

754
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,590
什麼  當然不是

755
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,150
盧卡斯  如果你是個戀童癖

756
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,750
現在你面前只有三個小男孩
你會承認嗎

757
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,140
大概是不會的

758
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,420
那他為什麼會承認

759
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,880
你們真是夠了

760
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,380
我看起來像個戀童癖嗎

761
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,910
-是的  -非常像

762
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,030
這樣對我可不公平

763
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,910
你是我見過最像戀童癖的人了

764
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,550
聽著  我不是戀童癖

765
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,190
我是個好人

766
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,930
行吧

767
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,250
進來吧  先把鞋脫了

768
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,500
你帶著彩彈槍幹嘛

769
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,340
萬一有人對我們心生歹意

770
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,940
這卡片真精緻

771
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,680
你怎麼搞來的

772
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,980
今年夏天我搬到這裡來住

773
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,620
我  馬克西
索爾開始幫別人看狗

774
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,920
我們掙了八美元

775
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,880
我們拿這錢買了一個飛昇卡包

776
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,160
裡面就有這張卡

777
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,620
你們運氣真好

778
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,780
遇見馬克西和索爾
才是真正的運氣好

779
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,480
真不錯

780
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,620
我們給這個三人組
取了個名字  豆袋男孩

781
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,640
你知道為什麼嗎

782
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,600
因為你們有幾個豆袋沙發嗎

783
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,400
沒錯

784
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,820
我真是個天才

785
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,460
成交吧

786
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,060
來握個手

787
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,420
這樁生意就算成了

788
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,680
不行  我不賣了

789
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,480
什麼東西

790
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,040
-對不起  -盧卡斯

791
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,840
你給我滾過來

792
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,880
你們這些12歲的小屁孩
就是這樣做生意的嗎

793
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,060
你剛剛幹嘛呢
你不是同意了嗎

794
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,960
你說過只要一個人不同意
我們就不賣

795
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
我不同意

796
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,540
你為什麼這麼在意這張卡

797
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,860
那你為什麼不在意呢

798
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,580
這張卡片承載了我們很多回憶

799
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,120
你就打算這麼扔掉了

800
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
就因為你想親一個普通女孩嗎

801
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,260
太狂野了吧

802
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,880
布希麗不是普通的女孩

803
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,360
我們可能是要結婚的

804
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,820
結了婚反正到頭也是離婚

805
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,140
盧卡斯

806
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,780
我們二比一佔多數

807
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,620
盧卡斯  你現在正在氣頭上

808
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,000
布希麗可能就是我一生摯愛

809
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,500
打擾一下  夫人  能給我杯水嗎

810
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,800
夫人

811
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,480
呃你們幾個

812
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,060
關於她有什麼故事嗎

813
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,620
她是哪裡人啊
看起來很異國風情

814
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,480
給我聽好了

815
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,380
這筆交易我只說一次

816
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,100
400塊買她

817
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,860
不  我們要550

818
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,220
去你大爺的吧

819
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,840
那是我全部的零用錢

820
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,460
聽著  克勞德  咱們廢話少說

821
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,500
我媽是專門干生意的

822
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,040
我倆都心知肚明

823
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,460
如果你不想要這個娃娃

824
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,040
你早就已經走了

825
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,520
別把我們當小屁孩

826
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,900
我們知道怎麼搞買賣

827
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,030
你到底要不要
這個心肺復甦娃娃

828
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,200
一群傻子

829
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
我本來想出價一千的

830
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,200
只有我一個人覺得他
要草那個娃娃嗎

831
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,560
*我們房子裡有瓶子  車也叫好了*

832
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,460
*所以再給我倒杯香檳*

833
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,900
*戴著閃閃的金項鏈*

834
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,700
*數著籌碼  這局已經拿下*

835
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,380
*躁動的我  躁動的空氣*

836
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,190
*從沒想到金子會讓我這麼著迷*

837
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,480
*我們是賭徒  不磨嘴皮子功夫*

838
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,380
我們要補水

839
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,800
已經差不多騎了14分鐘了

840
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,980
我覺得這是我離家最遠的一次

841
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,700
我記得我在這附近
演過《貓》來著

842
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,760
你真的不打算唱歌了嗎

843
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,760
是啊  我從沒這麼開心過

844
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,100
乖乖把藥給我們

845
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,920
草  怎麼找到我們的

846
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,880
那部手機  他們裝了追蹤軟體

847
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,310
我們是不會給的

848
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,300
我們要交給消防員

849
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,680
你倆戒毒去

850
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,080
衝啊

851
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,600
我們開著車  蠢貨們
你們跑不過的

852
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,000
呵呵  我們這可是旋風單車

853
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,300
車進不來了吧  傻大姐

854
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,180
靠

855
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,120
*沒時間準備了*

856
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,980
*生活本就是一場噩夢*

857
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,540
你要去哪

858
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,800
*你躲得過初一躲不過十五*

859
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,100
*你躲得過初一躲不過十五*

860
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,220
*你躲得過初一躲不過十五*

861
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,600
*你躲得過初一躲不過十五*

862
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,960
*你躲得過初一躲不過十五*

863
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,420
你想藥想瘋了吧

864
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
把藥給她就行了

865
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,720
騎快點

866
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,720
我不會讓你毀了自己的生活

867
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,820
你沒事吧

868
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,240
你確定沒事嗎

869
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,180
發生什麼事了

870
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,640
我們的保姆在追我們

871
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,100
因為她想摸我們的雞雞

872
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,190
什麼  這才不是真的

873
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,060
-是真的  -不是

874
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,620
我沒有

875
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,060
-你就想摸  -我沒有

876
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,740
快走  走

877
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,090
-怎麼了  -走

878
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,440
走  走

879
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,800
盧卡斯  你沒事吧

880
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,030
我覺得我沒事吧

881
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,760
-你的手臂  -哇操

882
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,680
我叫急救來

883
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,920
不不  沒事的  這事他經歷多了

884
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,160
快來  我們得走了  得走了

885
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,480
得走了

886
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,840
單車我來搬

887
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,680
好了

888
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,200
我把手機扔草叢裡了

889
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,570
她們追蹤不到我們了

890
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,970
好痛啊

891
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,140
盧卡斯  你要小聲點

892
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,580
好  我們有冰塊嗎

893
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,340
沒有  我們他媽在一條巷子裡

894
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,520
止痛藥呢

895
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,840
我們可以讓他吃茉莉

896
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,780
不要

897
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,700
的確不行
不然他吃了會想著草我們

898
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,040
叫救護車來

899
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,240
任務終止

900
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,360
我們會被抓的

901
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,160
你有醫保嗎話說

902
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,540
我不知道  你有嗎

903
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,480
我不知道

904
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,080
我好像只有免賠額險

905
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,800
沒事的

906
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,700
這種事綜合格鬥選手經常碰到

907
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
我們只要把你的手臂
往牆上用力撞

908
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,160
把關節按回去

909
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,400
行吧  去他媽的  早死早超生

910
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,280
來吧  輕點

911
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,320
一  二  走

912
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,060
撞錯邊了

913
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,120
-找新網站  新網站  -好

914
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,560
好  躺下把手臂給我

915
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,720
來

916
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,420
好

917
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,400
上面說下一步會很疼

918
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,260
你應該找個東西咬住

919
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,680
我知道了

920
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,520
張嘴

921
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,040
好了

922
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,280
好  數三下

923
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,260
一  二  走

924
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,840
-泰勒簡訊你了  -她說什麼了

925
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,960
她想知道你為什麼不在學校

926
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,860
以及你今晚派對去不去

927
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,100
就說...

928
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,260
哦對不起正事

929
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,000
-我來幫下  -好

930
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,980
一  二  三

931
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,120
沒想到真成功了

932
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,480
你會沒事的  兄弟

933
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,330
不

934
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,360
我有事

935
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,350
我父母要離婚了

936
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,800
你幹什麼壞事了

937
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,620
-索爾  -怎麼了

938
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,880
對不起

939
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,640
我爸爸要搬出去了

940
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,280
不管你父母發生了什麼事

941
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,140
永遠有豆袋男孩給你撐腰

942
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,140
永遠不分開

943
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,640
豆袋男孩一輩子

944
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,280
保證

945
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,680
-保證  -保證

946
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,480
來吧  咱們去幫你買點兒童止痛藥

947
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,610
-需要幫忙嗎  小老弟
-不  我可以

948
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,930
行吧  幫幫我

949
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,000
嘿  邁爾斯

950
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,230
嘿  是準備上班還是剛下班

951
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,340
剛連值完三輪

952
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,820
我不在乎誰被搶劫了

953
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,720
我只是不想再去填那些表了

954
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,460
警察

955
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,610
我們身上有  得無  皮引

956
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,840
人家會拼音好嗎

957
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,660
正常點  假裝在聊天

958
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,650
-聊什麼  -正常點就行

959
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,860
你覺得政治怎麼樣

960
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,440
嗯這事挺複雜

961
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,000
那個警察好奇怪

962
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,520
他在視奸我們

963
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,790
正常點  倆超酷男孩在正常對話

964
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,270
我們翹課了

965
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,340
盧卡斯

966
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,280
我們有麻煩了嗎

967
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,600
本來我是要匯報上去的

968
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,280
但因為你們的誠實

969
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,560
這次就算了  好嗎

970
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,640
答應我別再犯了

971
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,120
保證  謝謝長官

972
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,520
好

973
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,980
真險

974
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,920
索爾呢

975
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,880
*我不是最強的  不是最混的*

976
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,250
*不是最硬的  也不是最高的*

977
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,440
*但我說的話都是真的*

978
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,710
*我走路都是最有型的*

979
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,020
*別惹我開口*

980
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,180
*沒人想惹麻煩*

981
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,400
*再這樣搞我*

982
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,980
*你怎麼樣都沒用*

983
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
站住

984
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,460
過來

985
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,030
你褲襠裡是什麼

986
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,000
我的雞雞

987
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,240
掏出來

988
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,830
我雞雞也很大的

989
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,260
放回去

990
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,400
老子今天心情好放你們一馬

991
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,560
我們還有毒品

992
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,980
他本來就盯上我們了

993
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,690
好吧  你們有什麼

994
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,930
一級管制類藥品

995
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,550
還潛在傳播的可能

996
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,570
大哥  這是維他命好嗎
還是兒童維他命

997
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,860
不  這是毒品

998
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,040
如果這是毒品  那這也是毒品

999
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,190
如果你不逮捕我們
我就要舉報你

1000
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,590
-盧卡斯  -別他媽煩我了

1001
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,030
我知道對小孩子說髒話不好
但是草他媽的

1002
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,000
我逮捕你們也是因為
毀了我今天的好日子

1003
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,410
好嗎  這給我

1004
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,730
讓我回家吧

1005
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,000
-他在叫後援  -我們怎麼辦

1006
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,190
聽著

1007
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,310
我決定了  我不想要孩子

1008
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,580
怎麼了

1009
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,010
那個警察盯上我們了

1010
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,300
我們得殊死一逃了

1011
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,540
我知道辦法了

1012
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,920
不  這沒有商量餘地

1013
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,660
你雖然是探長  官比我大

1014
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,070
但婚姻關係裡  咱倆是平等的

1015
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,550
那邊掛了  呵呵行八

1016
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,750
免費  因為我是警察

1017
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,640
*想像一下*

1018
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,710
*我是一袋老二*

1019
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,690
*送到你的嘴邊*

1020
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,570
*我是變態*

1021
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,560
*我能把熊寶寶打進屎裡去*

1022
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,520
*嘴唇貼近我*

1023
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,630
*我會讓你去院子裡拿棍子*

1024
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,520
*捲一卷*

1025
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,670
*我就是話題終結者*

1026
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:18,820
你他媽怎麼回事  索爾
*我就是話題終結者*

1027
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,740
你他媽怎麼回事  索爾

1028
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,500
你根本不在意我的手臂

1029
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,780
你只想著酒

1030
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,660
我兩樣都在乎好嗎

1031
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,400
是啊  在乎的是你和你的酒

1032
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,040
現在我們成逃犯了

1033
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,660
你吼我幹嘛

1034
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,100
我現在還沒有祖傳單車了

1035
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,800
週日騎車日全他媽毀了

1036
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,860
你們看  看

1037
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,180
商場

1038
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,400
-耶  -太棒了

1039
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,880
太棒了

1040
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,900
來來

1041
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,820
我日

1042
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,220
我了個

1043
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,300
去他大爺的

1044
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,840
現在我們前有高速封路

1045
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,940
後有警察圍堵

1046
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,880
如果你不那麼腦殘的話

1047
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,000
我們也不至於這樣

1048
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,400
弟兄們  商場就在那

1049
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,900
我們只需要橫跨高速

1050
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,740
你看車都不怎麼動

1051
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,760
考驗我們是五年級
還是六年級的時候到了

1052
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,760
*沒人說話*

1053
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,940
*沒人被嗆*

1054
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,540
*沒人說話*

1055
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,260
*沒人被嗆*

1056
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,200
算了  我選擇撤退到林子裡去

1057
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,040
大不了就喝雨水
吃松鼠過活  我不在乎

1058
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,580
想都別想

1059
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,660
天

1060
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,100
這不就跟停車場一樣

1061
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,180
等一下  你還偷了一瓶酒

1062
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,540
你他媽怎麼回事  索爾

1063
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,520
說得容易  反正又不是你倆

1064
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,580
墓碑上還得刻上
奶嘴寶貝四個大字

1065
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,980
好好說話  別亂噴唾沫行嗎

1066
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,800
別上高速啊

1067
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,120
小朋友經過

1068
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,720
慢點  小朋友經過

1069
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,380
你們在幹什麼啊

1070
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,740
快回去

1071
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,960
快快快

1072
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,380
一群白癡

1073
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,160
等一下  我收到簡訊了

1074
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,160
是泰勒

1075
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,100
她說馬庫斯會去派對

1076
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,720
他超喜歡布希麗

1077
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,920
她絕對會親他

1078
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,140
他可是咱們年級的大暖男啊

1079
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,840
等等  我才是咱們年級的大暖男

1080
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,480
排名首先是我

1081
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,100
馬庫斯  馬克西
然後才輪得到你

1082
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,340
我可比馬克西暖多了

1083
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,760
你才沒有

1084
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,640
你去年把威洛比老師都弄哭了

1085
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,780
不是我弄哭的
我只是拍了她哭的照片

1086
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,280
大伙  大伙

1087
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,060
瞧

1088
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
媽呀

1089
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,380
糟了

1090
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,040
我操

1091
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,960
咱們快回去

1092
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,260
我們被困住了

1093
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,800
我們被困住了

1094
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,740
我們要死了  要死了

1095
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,560
我們不會的

1096
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,960
只需要抓準時機  好嗎

1097
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,220
只需要抓準時機

1098
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,620
我們可以的

1099
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,040
-加速  小瘋子  -天啊

1100
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,820
我操  他成功了

1101
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,800
我成功了

1102
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,160
盧卡斯  現在看著我

1103
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,540
我知道你很害怕
我不怕...一點都不怕

1104
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,360
別說了  索爾

1105
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,840
盧卡斯

1106
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,180
別呀

1107
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,640
我沒死

1108
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,400
他過來了  哥們  快來

1109
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,580
去你的

1110

我也愛你

1111
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,800
好了  快過來

1112
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,780
我要媽媽

1113
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,740
-加油  -加油

1114
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,800
我沒事  我就住這裡算了

1115
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,820
我很好

1116
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,680
快來

1117
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,680
你可以的

1118
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,400
好吧

1119
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,420
加油  索爾  你可不是奶嘴寶貝

1120
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,900
你所向披靡

1121
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,960
加油  索爾

1122
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,660
我啤酒掉了

1123
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,680
等一下

1124
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,400
那是我爸的心肺復甦假人

1125
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,020
那是我爸的心肺復甦假人

1126
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,260
我們沒殺人

1127
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,180
我們安全了

1128
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,620
我們沒殺人

1129
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,480
沒有  耶

1130
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,580
滴滴

1131
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,780
勞駕

1132
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,560
抱歉

1133
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,940
讓一下  借過借過

1134
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,220
抱歉

1135
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,800
我們之前打電話問過
BD雷霆無人機

1136
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,540
真抱歉

1137
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,040
賣掉了

1138
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,560
哈哈  真好笑

1139
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,020
不是  我真賣了

1140
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,060
賣給了兩個姑娘
她們說認識你們

1141
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,100
操你媽

1142
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,440
我要殺了你全家

1143
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,920
他糖是不是吃多了

1144
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,400
我要把你全家變成殭屍

1145
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,280
馬克西

1146
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,660
我本來要解釋
結果被你打斷了

1147
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,220
她們給你們留了個條

1148
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,100
-他們為什麼要這麼走路
-不曉得

1149
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,200
你們跟蹤我們

1150
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,960
我把你們的包扔在樹叢裡了

1151
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,540
傻了吧

1152
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,960
你告訴過我們

1153
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
如果你拿不到BD雷霆
你就完了

1154
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,960
而且小孩子騎三輪腳踏車
只能到這裡

1155
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,680
好了  毒品在這裡

1156
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,240
把無人機給我

1157
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,240
你他媽逗我

1158
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,000
什麼鬼

1159
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,280
這些全是維他命嚼片

1160
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,740
我跟你說了她會檢查的

1161
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,100
茉莉呢

1162
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,980
去哪了

1163
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,860
警察拿著呢

1164
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,340
你把我們的毒品給了警察

1165
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,020
等一下

1166
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,120
我知道你們不瞭解我們

1167
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,760
你覺得我們只是小屁孩

1168
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,080
但聽著

1169
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,760
你們無論遇到了什麼困難

1170
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,580
毒品都不是解決辦法

1171
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,120
毒品只能給你一種虛假的真實感

1172
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,020
可能你覺得生活夠糟了

1173
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,080
但你還有家人和朋友

1174
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,440
愛你的人

1175
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,800
你能不能閉嘴

1176
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,300
我剛花了600塊
買了個白癡無人機

1177
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,300
你毀了我的真情時刻

1178
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,520
你說得很蠢

1179
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,740
今天完蛋了

1180
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,380
只有本吉有茉莉

1181
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,080
他還不賣給我們

1182
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,240
很抱歉  但我們完蛋了

1183
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,640
我們可以買

1184
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,940
可以給你們買毒品

1185
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,100
我們才他媽不會

1186
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,600
怎麼回事

1187
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,280
你覺得他會給小孩賣嗎

1188
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:25,300
我們不是小孩  是吞世代

1189
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,560
（8歲至14歲的少年）
我們不是小孩  是吞世代

1190
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,860
我們有什麼好失去的

1191
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,780
成交嗎

1192
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,440
馬克西  你瘋了

1193
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,360
你應該就接受懲罰的

1194
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,760
我和盧卡斯去派對好了

1195
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,460
我們不會讓不懷好意的人
接近布希麗的

1196
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,100
他們沒邀請你們

1197
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,440
什麼

1198
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,480
酷小孩們只邀請了我

1199
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,080
你什麼意思

1200
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,900
他們覺得你們有點...

1201
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,000
平庸

1202
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,100
但沒關係
只要他們瞭解你們了

1203
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,260
他們就懂了

1204
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,680
你們不平庸

1205
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,260
你們很特別

1206
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,820
我才不要買毒品

1207
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,740
我也不要

1208
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,940
你們不用去  我來說

1209
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,340
你幫忙撐個場子就行

1210
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,240
你是我們當中

1211
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,500
唯一一個看上可能是大學生的

1212
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,140
夥伴們

1213
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,340
成交嗎

1214
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,260
就為了一個接吻派對
你們做了這麼多

1215
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,220
不  派對上還會有很多超酷的人

1216
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,980
我還記著我第一次
參加接吻派對

1217
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,100
那時是六年級暑假
在馬努什·佩特家

1218
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,080
你親了誰

1219
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,920
馬努什的妹妹

1220
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,340
等一下  你沒在嗎

1221
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,480
沒  那時我們還不認識

1222
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,380
我們雖然是一個年級的

1223
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,940
但是到八年級
我們才變成朋友的

1224
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,200
我感覺你們肯定認識好久了

1225
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,020
大家都知道

1226
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,020
你在幼兒園會遇到死黨

1227
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,580
對

1228
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,460
那時你們交到了朋友是因為

1229
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,420
你們住得近

1230
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,280
還有你們父母是朋友

1231
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,460
我們不是這樣的

1232
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,460
我們是朋友是因為喜歡對方

1233
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,880
還有我們住得近

1234
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,700
還有我們爸媽是朋友

1235
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,900
好了  過來

1236
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,080
進去  買兩片藥

1237
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,320
找本吉

1238
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,080
別提到漢娜

1239
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,100
誰是漢娜

1240
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,440
我

1241
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,680
我叫馬克西

1242
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,260
我知道你叫什麼

1243
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,720
就進去  買兩片藥

1244
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,340
然後我把無人機給你們

1245
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,380
如果出事了

1246
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,620
直接開走

1247
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:32,860
好

1248
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,980
現在回頭還不遲

1249
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,860
不行  我們得拿到毒品

1250
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,600
這樣才能拿到無人機
才能去派對

1251
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,340
有人嗎

1252
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,700
我是你爹地

1253
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,480
你是我的小嬰兒

1254
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,380
沒錯  爹地

1255
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,080
你要一直在這受罪

1256
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,640
直到你學會當個男子漢

1257
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,000
遵命  爹地

1258
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,620
小嬰兒都穿什麼

1259
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,100
紙尿褲

1260
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,840
晚安

1261
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,100
我們來找本吉

1262
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,540

00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,820
那是你兒子

1269
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,000
你們幾個坐那去然後等一下

1270
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,480
掉了要給我20塊  你這白癡

1271
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,020
有事嗎

1272
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,180
午安

1273
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,980
我們想買兩片茉莉  麻煩了

1274
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,300
是兄弟會的拉斐叫你們來的

1275
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,280
就是他  那個白癡
你們只有七歲吧

1276
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,500
除了你
我在經濟學課上見過你

1277
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,480
好嗎  兄弟

1278
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,500
說真的  我不給小孩賣毒品

1279
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,400
我們不是小孩  是吞世代

1280
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,140
誰讓你們來的

1281
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,800
賣我們毒品  就跟你說

1282
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,520
行

1283
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,620
先坐著

1284
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,460
你覺得要等多久

1285
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,860
你讓我嗨了

1286
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,520
告訴我誰讓你們來的

1287
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,440
漢娜

1288
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,720
怎麼了嘛  我嗨了

1289
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,960
她原來覺得我是這種人

1290
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,540
你們給漢娜說
如果她想要茉莉

1291
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,200
就要給我口

1292
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,440
你不能這麼跟女人說話

1293
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,000
她只有同意了

1294
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,800
才能給你口

1295
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,140
你可以給我口

1296
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,360
你也可以

1297
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,120
那我呢  我就坐著嗎

1298
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,620
我們可是豆袋男孩
什麼事都一起做

1299
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,040
快滾  你們這群小屁孩

1300
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,260
滾出去

1301
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,420
大伙  等一下

1302
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,000
我這邊有東西你可能會感興趣

1303
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,100
有屁快放

1304
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,740
白癡  現在誰是小屁孩了

1305
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,240
-我操  -什麼鬼

1306
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,520
不給我毒品  我就要被禁足了

1307
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,760
我就永遠親不到布希麗了

1308
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,700
馬克西

1309
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,560
你他媽在幹什麼

1310
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,800
你賣毒品

1311
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,040
我們過來買

1312
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,700
現在快賣給我們

1313
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,120
別考驗我的耐心

1314
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,100
行吧

1315
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,780
你想要毒品  我又不是你爸媽  給

1316
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,420
謝了

1317
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,820
糟了

1318
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,540
你他媽死定了

1319
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,960
下面是怎麼了

1320
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,700
她剛決定不起訴了

1321
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,180
老天

1322
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,680
我操

1323
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,720
馬克西  小心

1324
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,260
有我在  放心

1325
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,140
索爾

1326
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,680
老天  我剛殺了個人

1327
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,580
盧卡斯  快拿毒品

1328
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,180
我們沒有出現過

1329
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,380
快開車

1330
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,100
怎麼了

1331
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,260
趕快走

1332
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,100
什麼

1333
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,320
開啊

1334
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,600
快開

1335
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,880
盧卡斯  毒品

1336
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,780
不  不

1337
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,340
讓我看看瓶子裡是什麼

1338
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,020
說的對

1339
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,140
趕緊給我吧

1340
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,540
你們有點厲害啊

1341
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,260
因為我們是豆袋男孩

1342
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,980
那是什麼意思

1343
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,440
我們有豆袋沙發

1344
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,120
幹得不錯  小傢伙們

1345
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,220
祝你們接吻派對愉快

1346
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,440
謝謝

1347
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,740
只有2.7公里遠

1348
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,180
怎麼了

1349
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,680
我們拿到無人機了
事情都解決了

1350
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,280
馬克西

1351
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,880
我帥臉被揍啦  行嗎

1352
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,880
我們買毒品了

1353
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,760
我們就不能直接回家嗎

1354
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,420
朋友們  我爸電話

1355
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,720
-爸爸  -小傢伙

1356
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,740
飛機落早了
我十五分鐘後到家

1357
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,040
現在的十五分鐘
還是再過會的十五分鐘

1358
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,780
你這小傢伙真有意思

1359
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,200
很快就見到你啦

1360
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,860
我爸爸十五分鐘就到家

1361
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,700
他可能根本注意不到
無人機沒了

1362
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,780
他會的  他觀察力很強

1363
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,480
所以我媽媽才愛上他

1364
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,840
得在你爸爸到家之前
把無人機放回去

1365
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,340
我知道

1366
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,780
只有無人機

1367
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,020
沒有你

1368
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,820
只有無人機

1369
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:36,840
好的

1370
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,340
出發啦

1371
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,440
我到了

1372
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,460
-小心點  -我可以  我可以

1373
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,600
隨風飛翔吧  馬克西

1374
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,920
在前面這右轉

1375
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,040
-我能看見你家
-就在那  那

1376
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,640
窗戶關著

1377
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,580
日  那怎麼辦

1378
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,740
煙囪

1379
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,380
這太窄了

1380
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,580
你可以的

1381
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,740
我看不見  看不見

1382
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,520
鏡頭上全是菸灰

1383
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,500
用原力

1384
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,840
不  我可以的  我瞭解我家房子

1385
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,620
我閉上眼都行

1386
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,240
別弄壞什麼東西

1387
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,480
相信我  我可以

1388
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,520
你成功了

1389
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,760
-我是有史以來最棒的駕駛員
-沒錯

1390
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,840
-我們成功了  -太棒了

1391
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,840
任務成功

1392
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,820
爸爸

1393
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,080
你安全到家了嗎

1394
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,620
我真的不敢相信
我那麼信任你

1395
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,820
我明確和你說了
不要碰無人機

1396
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,240
我的上帝啊

1397
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,300
我愛你

1398
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,680
爸爸

1399
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,140
爸爸  拜託

1400
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,580
回我"我愛你"啊

1401
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,940
我得聽你說

1402
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:20,940
喂

1403
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,180
我爸爸說我被禁足了

1404
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,600
我再也沒有機會
親吻布希麗了

1405
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,260
沒事的  馬克西
還會有別的派對的

1406
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,580
盧卡斯  你沒有明白

1407
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,840
他說的對   盧卡斯

1408
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,620
這個派對會改變我們的人生

1409
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,740
而你根本不在乎

1410
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,520
這一點都不酷

1411
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,400
好像你知道什麼酷一樣

1412
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,860
你到底什麼意思

1413
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,580
去嘬你的啤酒啊  奶嘴寶貝

1414
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,880
我喜歡啤酒

1415
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,280
我會去的

1416
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,060
你可能覺得你可成熟了

1417
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,080
可是事實是

1418
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,380
你連陰毛都沒有

1419
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,960
而我已經有六根了

1420
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,100
你說你有陰毛

1421
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,580
你還說你喝啤酒

1422
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:56,720
而我知道你沒有

1423
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,820
別吵了

1424
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,420
承認吧  你翹掉音樂劇試演

1425
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,780
因為你覺得那不酷

1426
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,860
哪怕你擁有天賜的聲音

1427
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,360
你總在誇大其詞

1428
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,840
但從不能說到做到

1429
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,840
就像在高速路上一樣

1430
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,800
抱歉我不能穿過十二條車道

1431
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,880
好讓你親吻什麼騷貨

1432
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,120
日哦

1433
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,240
她才不是騷貨
她是我一生摯愛

1434
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,080
收回那句話

1435
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,160
別上空手道啊

1436
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,260
別打架

1437
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,840
你絕不能用騷貨稱呼一個女人

1438
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,600
你不能用任何東西稱呼一個女人

1439
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,320
還有你

1440
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,060
你讓我們逃學

1441
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,800
帶著毒品到處跑

1442
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,620
把一個警察用什麼東西
關在便利商店裡

1443
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,980
我現在懷疑那是個假陽具

1444
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,240
你他媽的看什麼呢  甘道夫

1445
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,500
你們什麼都不懂

1446
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
荷爾蒙在我身體裡亂竄

1447
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,360
讓我做傻事

1448
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,080
你們知道滿腦子

1449
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,300
想著日樹是什麼感覺嗎

1450
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,620
你覺得你比我們強

1451
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,420
不是更強  是更成熟

1452
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,560
我在追求戀情  把握當下

1453
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,960
而你們還在玩著小孩把戲

1454
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,960
我都不知道我們怎麼還是朋友

1455
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,840
你喜歡的東西現在都取消了

1456
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,660
生日派對取消

1457
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,380
假期取消

1458
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,100
夏天的活動都取消

1459
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,900
凜冬將至

1460
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:39,920
對不起  爸爸

1461
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:42,700
不  你以後不准叫我爸爸

1462
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,260
叫我安德魯  或者紐曼先生
或者典獄長

1463
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,400
在你那副天使面孔下

1464
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:50,030
隱藏著惡魔

1465
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,640
我會永遠愛你

1466
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,430
因為你是我的兒子

1467
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,480
但我再也不會喜歡你了

1468
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:05,310
索索

1469
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,950
我剛跟馬克西的媽媽通了話

1470
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,360
你知道他翹了課
還自己騎車去了商城嗎

1471
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,410
-他那麼說的  -是啊

1472
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:16,100
答應我絕不要做

1473
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,230
那麼蠢的事

1474
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:19,490
我答應你

1475
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,900
然後我們穿過高速路

1476
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,430
我的手臂脫臼了

1477
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,220
一個女人模型從車裡飛出來

1478
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,900
但我們還拿著毒品

1479
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,790
然後我們用它換了無人機

1480
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,900
然後馬克西開著那個
把家裡搞得一團糟

1481
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:37,460
但那只是因為他想娶布希麗

1482
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,540
但現在他不行了
因為他這輩子都要被禁足了

1483
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,980
然後我們狠狠吵了一架

1484
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,590
然後豆袋男孩解散了

1485
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,810
然後  我有麻煩嗎

1486
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,570
好吧  兒子  你看

1487
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,670
我喜歡全是胡言亂語的故事

1488
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,060
就跟別人一樣

1489
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,660
我知道你正在經歷一段
充滿壓力的時期

1490
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:53,060
但那不是你撒謊的原因

1491
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:54,600
我沒有撒謊

1492
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:56,910
我百分之百確定你在撒謊

1493
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,850
我沒在撒謊

1494
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:00,620
我想我知道發生了什麼事

1495
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,070
你覺得你在失去我們

1496
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,010
現在  你擔心
你還要失去你的朋友

1497
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,030
看著我  我們會一直在這裡

1498
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,660
別誤會我

1499
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,390
我跟你媽媽都不是我們

1500
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,520
初識的樣子了

1501
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:16,520
得分開一段時間  但是沒事

1502
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,370
你記著你的寄居蟹嗎

1503
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,470
-赫爾曼  -對  赫爾曼

1504
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,090
你記著他為什麼死了嗎

1505
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:23,310
混蛋

1506
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,440
你跟我說它跑了

1507
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:26,600
也可以這麼說

1508
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,010
它跑了  然後它死了

1509
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,620
天啊  怎麼回事

1510
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,080
赫爾曼死了

1511
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,430
是因為寄居蟹蟹殼脫落之後

1512
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,350
它們得在沙灘上找個新的

1513
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:37,590
更大的貝殼來住

1514
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,510
要不就會死  但我們不知道

1515
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,080
所以赫爾曼是因為你們才死的

1516
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,580
重點是

1517
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,330
你和你的朋友在成長  在變化

1518
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,100
你們都得去找更大的殼

1519
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,470
這沒什麼不好的

1520
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,360
好了  聽著  我們應該怪寵物商店

1521
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,680
因為是他們沒有告訴我們
寄居蟹是這樣的

1522
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,320
我是盧卡斯

1523
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,590
你他媽的嚇死我了

1524
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,490
我不想讓你父母看見我的臉

1525
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,090
你在這幹什麼

1526
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,070
我過去兩個小時成長了很多

1527
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,570
我父母的離婚讓我改變很多

1528
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,180
要是豆袋男孩不能一起長大

1529
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,240
他們就會越來越分離

1530
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:29,870
我不想那樣

1531
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:32,700
我不想跟你們分開

1532
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,630
那你就得去索仁的派對

1533
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,120
你得溜出去

1534
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,490
我不能  我被禁足了

1535
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,980
而且布希麗的項鏈還在窯裡

1536
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,940
我來操心那個項鏈

1537
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,510
你父母能做什麼

1538
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,620
翻倍禁足

1539
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,980
布希麗是不是你永遠的愛

1540
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,720
那你現在就跟我走

1541
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,340
好吧  我跟你去

1542
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,490
但我不要跟索爾道歉

1543
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,730
他不來

1544
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:57,650
挺好的

1545
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,220
日他媽的小混球

1546
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,610
我穿上外套

1547
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,780
馬克西

1548
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:04,970
怎麼

1549
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
拿出點氣勢來

1550
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,720
你說索爾不來的

1551
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,030
他為什麼在這

1552
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,460
父母算個什麼

1553
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,590
我們現在要一起
搬進更大的寄居蟹殼了

1554
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,750
我爸媽說的時候很有意義的

1555
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:26,840
所以你一個人擔下了是吧

1556
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,060
我想了想你會怎麼做

1557
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,610
然後反著來

1558
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,690
這場派對會是史詩級轉折

1559
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,080
好吧  奶嘴寶貝

1560
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,920
可別擋我路了  衛生棉
此品牌前半部分和max諧音

1561
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:51,570
你們幾個小男孩真可愛

1562
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,300
他們都在地下室

1563
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,870
我都不想知道在底下幹嘛

1564
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,340
快進來  小伙子們

1565
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:58,910
你好

1566
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,340
天啊  你來了

1567
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,980
麥克西
我想讓你認識認識布希麗

1568
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:29,850
你好  我是馬克西

1569
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,740
你好

1570
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,510
太好了  終於見到你了

1571
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,100
你也是

1572
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,630
外套挺酷

1573
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:39,140
謝謝

1574
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,720
我自己決定要這個的

1575
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,390
當然我媽媽也在

1576
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,800
我也跟我媽媽一起逛街

1577
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,530
這一切進行的可真順利啊

1578
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,870
你帶來項鏈了嗎

1579
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,550
布希麗  這是給你的

1580
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,600
謝謝

1581
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:57,630
真好看

1582
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:58,820
是月工的

1583
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,340
真棒

1584
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,900
我一會再戴這個

1585
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,920
謝謝你  麥克西

1586
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,940
你好嗎  奶嘴寶貝

1587
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,040
不壞  也就是

1588
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,580
跟一群男人打了場架

1589
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,980
偷了瓶啤酒

1590
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:20,230
奶嘴寶貝看起來可不像要喝它

1591
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,490
我不止要喝它

1592
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,250
我還要破紀錄

1593
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,340
我要喝四口

1594
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:29,650
不可能喝四口

1595
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,310
索仁都不能喝四口

1596
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,060
閉嘴

1597
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,190
喝吧

1598
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,080
這是一口

1599
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:54,800
沒什麼了不起

1600
01:08:58,690 --> 01:08:59,570
這是兩口

1601
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,050
行唄

1602
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,280
第三口

1603
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,090
簡直瘋了

1604
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,330
他快要吐了

1605
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,300
誰給他拿一個奶瓶啊

1606
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,940
奶嘴寶貝  奶嘴寶貝

1607
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,140
奶嘴寶貝  奶嘴寶貝

1608
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,480
奶嘴寶貝  奶嘴寶貝

1609
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,640
奶嘴寶貝  奶嘴寶貝

1610
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,820
奶嘴寶貝

1611
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,720
這是他媽第四口

1612
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,130
我的天

1613
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,820
索爾  索爾  索爾

1614
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,820
我他媽是個酒鬼

1615
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,500
四口  厲害

1616
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,720
對索爾充滿了敬佩

1617
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,620
眼睛看這裡

1618
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,570
如果你不同意親嘴

1619
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,880
那沒關係

1620
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,640
你可以上樓去玩VR

1621
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,310
但是如果你留在樓下

1622
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,420
最好做好準備
因為我們要開始玩真的了

1623
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,350
我們來轉瓶子吧

1624
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,860
真好  我這裡正好有個瓶子

1625
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:08,090
*還記得我們曾一起跳舞嗎*

1626
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,770
*種種狀況和意外層出不窮*

1627
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:17,470
*年輕時不懂因果總有聯繫*

1628
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:23,220
*還一起高歌未唱完的曲子*

1629
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,790
*那是激情的一刻*

1630
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,180
我不玩了

1631
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,870
你去哪裡

1632
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,290
剛才那太噁心了

1633
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,300
我要上樓去玩VR

1634
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,690
如果你走了
你再也不能回來了

1635
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,780
那可真是太慘了

1636
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,820
布希麗

1637
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,060
該你了

1638
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,460
一定要是我  一定要是我

1639
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,240
我的天  這大概是我見過
最狗血的一幕了

1640
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,670
他不會親的

1641
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,520
他會親的

1642
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:41,940
我做不到

1643
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,390
本性難移

1644
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,560
他還是那個奶嘴寶貝

1645
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,460
等等  是親嘴寶貝

1646
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:51,250
親嘴寶貝

1647
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,470
親嘴寶貝

1648
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,660
親嘴寶貝

1649
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,780
親嘴寶貝

1650
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,310
滾開  阿提卡斯

1651
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,220
他的名字叫索爾

1652
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,370
所有人都知道你媽媽
那本廚藝書是抄的

1653
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,360
索爾  等一等

1654
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,140
對不起我罵你用力過猛

1655
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,700
不  你是對的

1656
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,660
一直以來

1657
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,270
我都努力成為別人

1658
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,070
我帶了耳環

1659
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,980
我喝了啤酒

1660
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,070
我不唱歌了

1661
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,900
想我今天也有點發瘋吧

1662
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,390
我們離開這裡吧

1663
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:33,790
不

1664
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,520
你不想這麼做

1665
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,180
你要留在這裡親布希麗

1666
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,360
豆袋男孩所有事情都一起做

1667
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,110
並不是所有事情

1668
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,190
也不再是這樣了

1669
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,120
也行這兩個大姐姐說得沒錯

1670
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,160
也許我們走的路不同

1671
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:56,840
也許吧

1672
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,310
你準備怎麼做

1673
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,020
我不知道

1674
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,040
我只知道我們
不像他們說得那樣

1675
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:05,840
絕不可能

1676
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,480
這簡直瘋了

1677
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,030
別管那瓶子怎麼指了

1678
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,220
現在  走到那裡去
然後親你未來的老婆

1679
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,440
再見

1680
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:18,590
再見

1681
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:46,790
布希麗

1682
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:48,840
我能親你嗎

1683
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:51,650
可以

1684
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:22,690
酷

1685
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,560
我在哪裡

1686
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,100
原來我在這裡

1687
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:28,650
盧卡斯  我準備走了

1688
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,290
你確定你不想試試這個嗎

1689
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:32,780
不  我不用了

1690
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,950
想去我的家裡玩
《暗殺神卡牌》嗎

1691
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,040
我不想再玩《暗殺神卡牌》了

1692
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,860
那我該和誰玩

1693
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,480
你會找到人的

1694
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,490
我的臉感覺好痛啊

1695
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,220
不可能

1696
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,410
我的天

1697
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,760
這太棒了  真不敢相信你們...

1698
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,420
在這裡

1699
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:58,750
這真是太棒了

1700
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,050
你們好

1701
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,640
別  求你們了  別  別殺我們

1702
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,980
發生了什麼事

1703
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,290
你們怎麼認識索仁的

1704
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,730
他是你的男朋友嗎

1705
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,660
他是我弟弟

1706
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,530
我愛死那個小混蛋了

1707
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,900
你們  另外人呢

1708
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,850
你們那個有悲傷眼睛的朋友呢

1709
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,710
憂鬱男孩馬克西

1710
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:25,440
在地下室裡親嘴呢

1711
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,140
下面真是個亂交派對啊

1712
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,770
你們倆對這個不感興趣嗎

1713
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,420
好吧  沒關係  你們才6年級

1714
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,960
你們總會想明白的

1715
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,720
是的  你們有一生的時間
去做這件事

1716
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,780
不急不急

1717
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:39,110
你們喜歡什麼

1718
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,520
《暗殺神卡牌》  規則

1719
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,410
禁毒宣傳

1720
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,410
烤乳酪

1721
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,950
我現在也想要點烤乳酪

1722
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,300
我可以去做烤乳酪

1723
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,830
聽起來真棒

1724
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,120
無袖男孩  你呢  你喜歡什麼

1725
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:56,230
我喜歡唱歌

1726
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:57,940
太好了

1727
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,480
其實我今天還逃了試鏡

1728
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,300
現在  我沒辦法參加了

1729
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,040
不

1730
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,420
什麼

1731
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,650
你得說服他讓你參加試鏡

1732
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,420
你必須  必須

1733
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,100
為我們唱歌

1734
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:10,480
不

1735
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,710
我的天  為我們唱歌

1736
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:13,680
為我們唱歌吧

1737
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,740
所以  沒有烤乳酪嗎

1738
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,340
獵酒者  為我們唱歌

1739
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:30,720
*我得花一點時間*

1740
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:36,320
*花一點時間好好想想*

1741
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,130
*我最好仔細思索其中含義*

1742
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:46,980
*以防我長大之後需要*

1743
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,830
*現在我要爬過這座山*

1744
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,970
*彷彿整個世界都壓在我肩上*

1745
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:06,500
*穿過迷霧  看到愛的光芒*

1746
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,810
*給這冰冷的人生帶來些許溫暖*

1747
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:14,480
*我這一生*

1748
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:18,410

1749
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,860
*我不知道*

1750
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:23,960
*我能否再次面對*

1751
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,380
*現在我不能停下*

1752
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,370
*我已走得太遠*

1753
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:36,060
*只為改變這寂寞人生*

1754
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:41,140
*我想知道愛是什麼*

1755
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:47,040

1759
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:10,410
*花一些時間去審視自己*

1760

01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,540
*我的一生*

1763
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:26,070
*充滿心酸痛苦*

1764
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:28,480
*我不知道*

1765
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,580
*能否再次面對*

1766
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:34,340
*現在我不能停下*

1767
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:37,100
*我已走得太遠*

1768
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,600

1769
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,400

1773
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,860
*我們談談愛吧*

1774
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,730
*我想知道愛是什麼*

1775
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,520
*心中感受到愛*

1776
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,100
我的傑作

1777
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,120
謝謝你  我是認真的

1778
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:13,940
你好  馬克西

1779
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,380
我馬上回來

1780
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,610
你好  我沒想到你會來

1781
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,380
你在搞笑嗎

1782
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:22,520
你知道我從來
不錯過你的表演

1783
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,420
你刺那個皮條客的時候
可真是太酷了

1784
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,070
謝謝你

1785
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,580
抱歉忘了  索爾  這是史考特

1786
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,680
演得真棒

1787
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,370
謝你  親愛的

1788
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,920
我白天的時候更棒

1789
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,390
我要去找凱西

1790
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:38,810
我以為你還是被禁足呢

1791
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:40,420
昨天就結束了

1792
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:41,860
整整一個月

1793
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,420
謝謝你為我背黑鍋

1794
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,070
你也會為我做一樣的事情的

1795
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:47,980
我的天

1796
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,740
看看誰在這裡  我

1797
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,370
-你好呀  -你好呀

1798
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:54,450
趕緊我們已經幾週沒講話了

1799
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,450
是啊

1800
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,130
馬克西

1801
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,940
我媽說如果你媽媽
來接我們的話

1802
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,270
她會把我們放在冰霜凍優格

1803
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,780
太好了  寶貝  我馬上過來

1804
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:05,200
好的  寶貝

1805
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,380
和史考特處得怎麼樣

1806
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,100
挺好的

1807
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:10,390
但也挺艱難

1808
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:11,350
但是挺好的

1809
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,540
處理好感情關係挺難的

1810
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:15,490
但是別讓別人對你指手畫腳

1811
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,330
嘿  盧卡斯

1812
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,520
你仍然想等會和我們玩
《暗殺神卡牌》嗎

1813
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,590
我馬上就到那裡

1814
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,310
典型的盧卡斯

1815
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,340
卡洛斯和那些反霸凌聯盟的人
看起來挺酷的

1816
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:28,530
他們是很酷

1817
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,750
但是他們不是豆袋男孩

1818
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:34,870
馬克西

1819
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:39,550
好吧

1820
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,290
看來我得走了

1821
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,500
嗯  好的  嗯

1822
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:49,740

00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,073
I forgot,

145
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,974
I have musical auditions
this Friday.

146
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,643
They drug-test for beer.

147
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:29,112
Thor, just admit you're
a scared little-wittle baby.

148
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:30,881
No, I'm not.

149
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:34,051
Want us to put the beer in
a sippy cup for you, Sippy Cup?

150
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:35,952
- No.
- Sippy Cup.

151
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:38,589
- Amazing burn, Atticus.
- It's not a good burn.

152
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,591
His dad has two DUIs and has
to take the train to work.

153
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:42,593
That's a good burn.

154
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:44,695
Sippy Cup, sing us a song.

155
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:46,029
No.

156
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,566
How about "Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Bitch"?

157
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:51,369
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

158
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:52,436
No, no, guys.

159
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:54,805
He'll do it, but he just
needs more time to think.

160
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:56,543
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

161
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:01,144
Bye.

162
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:05,849
Lasagna and soda?

163
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,853
Don't tell
my parents you gave me this.

164
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:11,622
This kid is hilarious.

165
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,428
We're getting a divorce.

166
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,695
Wh-What do you mean?

167
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,864
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
Everything gonna stay the same.

168
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,165
We promise.

169
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,533
Will we still watch
<i>This Is Us</i> together?

170
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:24,534
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

171
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,536
That's our favorite show.

172
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:26,604
That's our family show.

173
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:27,772
Except now you're gonna see it

174
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:29,572
on two-two different TVs,
you know.

175
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,108
In two different houses.

176
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,777
So you're gonna have to watch
the episode twice.

177
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,811
What about Taco Tuesday?

178
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,479
Taco Tuesdays
are still going down.

179
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,581
Matter of fact, you're gonna
have two Taco Tuesdays,

180
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,450
just one on Wednesday now.

181
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,018
Twice the fun.

182
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,821
Twice the fun, twice the tacos.

183
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:45,523
It's... everything's
gonna stay the same, so...

184
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:47,590
Everything gonna be the same.
Me and your mom, you know,

185
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,026
we're still best friends,
right?

186
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,397
Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,730
I mean, it would've
been nice to have

188
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:55,532
tacos together as a family,
but how about this?

189
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:56,867
We could change it
to Wing Wednesday...

What's wrong?

209
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,248
That song always makes me sad.

210
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,117
Don't forget, <i>Rock of Ages</i>
auditions are tomorrow.

211
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,853
It's my favorite musical.

212
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,620
I did make some
pretty big changes, though,

213
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,255
based on my time
in Holly-weird.

214
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:53,990
I think it'll really

215
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:56,560
inspire those of you

216
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:57,827
who dare to dream.

217
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:58,863
Sick.

218
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,665
So, I looked at her,
but she was looking

219
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,733
the other direction.

220
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,100
But then she looked at me,

221
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,902
and I was looking
the other direction.

222
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,739
So I think that someday
we're gonna make eye contact.

223
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:09,840
That's cool.

224
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,642
This musical is gonna be lit.

225
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:12,810
Hey, Soren.

226
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,110
Look at this.

227
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:16,616
Sippy Cup is signing up
for the musical.

228
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:21,151
Singing is for try-hards.

229
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:24,821
No, uh, someone signed me up
as a joke.

230
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,691
I was just crossing it off.
See?

231
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,192
Yeah, whatever, bitch tits.

232
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:31,762
Enough. Let's go.

233
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:34,665
- I have places to be.
- Sorry, Soren.

234
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,734
Don't listen to Atticus.

235
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,701
His dad doesn't even pay taxes.

236
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,604
Doesn't matter
what Atticus says.

237
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:42,138
I've been thinking about
quitting singing

238
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,806
ever since I was young.

239
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:46,944
Come on.
We're gonna miss fish sticks.

240
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,957
Whoa. That's the best lunch
I've ever seen.

241
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,761
Yeah, my parents are being
super nice because...

242
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:05,963
because...

243
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,697
they're great and...

244
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,002
they're great,
and ev-everything's good.

245
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:15,038
Ooh, wait.
Is that a new earring?

246
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,774
Yes, finally.
Thank you for noticing.

247
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,877
- It looks cute on you.
- Max, I'm not going for cute.

248
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,711
I'm going for sexy and hot.

249
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:24,047
Those are the only two things
I'm looking for.

250
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,248
You like it?

251
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,685
It looks infected.

252
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,656
Soren's so cool.

253
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:34,023
I heard he beat up
Derek Bachman

254
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,091
and blow-jobbed his sister.

255
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,261
He blow-jobbed his own sister?

256
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:39,296
No, he blow-jobbed
Derek's sister.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,535
Fucking legend.

258
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,075
I think Soren's calling me.

259
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:56,279
♪ Uh, how we get down ♪

260
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,748

263
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:07,123
I heard you sipped a beer
like a fucking champ.

264
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,058
Yeah, I took a pretty big sip,
actually.

265
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,226
Cool.

266
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,028
I'm having a party
tomorrow night.

267
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,699
All these fools are coming.

268
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,300
You in?

269
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:17,801
You should come.

270
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,003
Trust me.

271
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,903
Yeah, I'll come,

272
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,275
but, you know,
I'll have to ask my mom.

273
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,777
Also, gonna be a kissing party.

274
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,051
You've French-kissed
girls before, right?

275
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:36,753
Yeah.

276
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,254
Of course.

277
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:39,758
Where?

278
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:45,095
Their mouths?

279
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,797
Yeah, dawg.

280
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,932
He's not gonna start sitting

281
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,036
with the popular kids, is he?

282
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,808
No. If anyone should be
over there, it's me.

283
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,042
We heard kids were
calling you Sippy Cup,

284
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:01,011
and we just wanted to let you
know you can always call on

285
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,180
the Student Coalition Against
Bullying for protection.

286
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,148
Does this look like
a sippy cup?

287
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,984
No, it's a fucking juice box.

288
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:10,387
'Cause I'm not a fucking child.

289
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,888
That's so rude.

290
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,858
Wait. Can I bring
Thor and Lucas?

291
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:19,028
So random.

292
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,730
No, they're cool.

293
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,432
I'm trying to keep it
half girls, half guys.

294
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:23,801
You feel me, dawg?

295
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:25,768
I feel you, dawg, but...

296
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,271
they're my best friends.

297
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:29,709
We do everything together.
We're the Bean Bag Boys.

298
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:32,042
That's a dope-ass name.

299
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:34,845
Fuck it. Bring 'em.

300
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,846
I ride or die
for my squad, too.

301
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,949
Let me know
what your mom says, dawg.

302
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,053
Okay. Bye, dawg.
Bye, dawgs.

303
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:44,988
So?

304
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,989
Soren just invited us
to his party tomorrow.

305
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,859
- Soren?
- Yeah.

306
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,128
He said my name?
He said "Thor"?

307
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,763
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Sweet.

308
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,032
Oh, there's also
gonna be girls there.

309
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,399
You know what that means?

310
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:58,268
Drama.

311
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,268
Kissing.

312
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:06,075
So, do you guys know
how to kiss?

313
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:07,945
- I have no fucking clue.
- No.

314
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,816
No, not at all.

315
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:12,816
<i>Type "kissing."</i>

316
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:14,920
Ooh. No, no, no. "Boobs."

317
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,154
"Breast cancer research."

318
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:20,490
"How to find a bra that fits."

319
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:22,428
I have an idea.

320
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,369
"Are you 18 or older?"

321
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:34,003
I'm gonna click "yes."

322
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,404
We're not 18 or older.

323
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:37,807
This could go on
our permanent record.

324
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:41,277
I'm your stepmother.
You are not supposed to be

325
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,346
- looking at me in the shower.
- Don't tell my dad.

326
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:44,882
He'll make me quit
the sports team.

327
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,783
Get up. Get up.

328
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:48,284
He's in trouble.

329
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,253
You deserve a punishment.

330
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:51,421
Pull down your shorts.

331
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:52,855
Is that what happens

332
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,490
when you get a stepmom?

333
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:57,226
Ew.

334
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:59,329
No way that's gonna fit
in there.

335
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,531
Get out of there, girl!

336
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,199
Where did his hand go?

337
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:03,267
- Ew!
- Oh, my God!

338
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,138
Nobody even kissed.

339
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,242
Yeah, not on their mouths
at least.

340
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,378
My parents have a CPR doll.

341
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,180
We can go practice kissing
on that.

342
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:18,181
Come on.

343
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:27,327
This is
a really pretty CPR doll.

344
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:31,195
I guess I'll go first.

345
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,431
Stop.

346
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,200
What are you doing?

347
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,534
Kissing her.

348
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:40,571
You can't kiss someone
without their permission.

349
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,538
Remember from assembly?

350
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,941
Pretend it's Brixlee.

351
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:46,008
- Try to be a gentleman.
- Okay.

352
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,244
Brixlee, can I kiss you?

353
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,946
Why?

354
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:51,915
- Why?
- Yeah.

355
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,550
What do you like about me?

356
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,319
Well...

357
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,988
you're sweet.
You smell good.

358
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,422
You're smart, too.

359
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,023
You always push Henry
in his wheelchair

360
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,558
even though he's super mean.

361
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,128
And just when I think
I've got you figured out,

362
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,030
you go ahead
and start skateboarding.

363
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,966
I consent.

364
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,509
- How was it?
- Sticky.

365
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,414
Why does she have hair
in her mouth?

366
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,984
You know what? This isn't
teaching us anything.

367
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:28,484
We need to see
real people kissing.

368
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,987
That's the only way to know
if we're doing it right.

369
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:33,223
My neighbor is
a total nymphomaniac.

370
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:35,192
Her boyfriend's always over.

371
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:36,926
She starts fires?

372
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:40,296
No, that's a pyromaniac.
She's a nymphomaniac.

373
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:43,032
Someone who has sex
on land and sea.

374
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,636
Seriously?

375
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:48,071
Okay, I was gonna wait
till tomorrow to surprise you,

376
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,438
but can I just tell you?

377
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,341
- Nah, I'm good.
- No, you want to know.

378
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:54,311
Ugh. I can barely see anything.

379
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,013
I know we haven't been
hanging out much,

380
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,347
you know,
ever since I met Benji,

381
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:58,916
but I want to
make it up to you.

382
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,051
So, tomorrow,
I'm skipping school,

383
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,452
and we're driving to the city
to see Kendrick Lamar.

384
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:04,454
- Shut up!
- And we're gonna do Molly.

385
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:06,255
- You thought of everything.
- Of course I fucking have.

386
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,024
It's gonna be amazing.

387
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:09,959
Remix!

388
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:13,930
Well, Benji got us the Molly.

389
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,699
- Benjamin.
- Oh, thank you!

390
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:17,801
Look.

391
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:21,504
This isn't working.
Maybe we could go climb a tree.

392
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,340
No, they'd see us.

393
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:25,108
No, I just meant
let's go climb a tree.

394
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,176
Dude, wait.

395
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:29,378
I know a way
we can see them kiss.

396
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,155
I can't.

397
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,724
It has a camera.
We could see everything.

398
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,993
We can learn technique.

399
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,994
It's for his dad's work.
It's not a toy.

400
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,965
Of course it's a toy.
They sell it at toy stores.

401
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,966
My uncle flew a drone
for the Army,

402
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:52,969
and now he yells in his sleep
and has crazy diarrhea.

403
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:55,205
It's messed up that he even
keeps it in the house.

404
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,374
You have to walk by it
every day.

405
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:58,708
- He's torturing you.
- It's true.

406
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,011
It's like when your cousin
walks around in a bikini

407
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:02,378
and she taunts you.

408
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,113
If he finds out,
you'll be grounded.

409
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,015
You won't be able
to go to Soren's.

410
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,452
And even worse, you'll lose
your father's trust.

411
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,186
It's true, too.

412
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:12,089
She'll love you
for who you are.

413
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,724
Yeah, a shitty kisser.
Remember the porn from earlier?

414
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:16,292
That guy didn't even know
how to kiss.

415
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:17,627
He was just licking
that woman's asshole.

416
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:20,363
- You want to kiss an asshole, Max?
- No.

417
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:22,331
Max, don't listen to him.
He just wants to go

418
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,734
because he's obsessed
with popular boys.

419
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:27,137
Believe me, Max.
You don't want to go to Soren's

420
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:29,539
not knowing how to kiss.

421
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,780
So, tomorrow,
after you get some girl time,

422
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,483
why don't you come over
for some man time?

423
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:41,784
No, I told you I'm hanging out
with Lily this weekend.

424
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,653
Yeah, it's just...
you know, it's hard

425
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:46,455
for me not to see you,
'cause you're my best friend.

426
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:48,792
- But Lily's my best friend.
- Yeah, I get it.

427
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:50,226
Totally, totally get it.

428
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,428
Yeah.

429
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,331
I'll probably just hang out
with my ex, Margaret.

430
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,333
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

431
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,535
Uh, no.
Why? Are you jealous?

432
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,473
Yeah, this isn't working out.

433
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,742
I know. You're not hot enough
to be acting like this,

434
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:07,476
so the next time
that you're wondering

435
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:09,646
where all the nice guys went,
just remember

436
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:12,051
that you let one walk
right out the door.

437
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,552
What?

438
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:18,054
I didn't say anything.

439
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,558
I never want to see you again.

440
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:24,464
Are you okay?

441
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:28,799
Wait, where'd the guy go?

442
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,100
Who cares?
The girls just hugged.

443
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,102
They are definitely gonna kiss.

444
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:34,404
We might need to get closer.

445
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:37,073
Do you hear that?

446
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,408
What is that?

447
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,177
It's fucking spying on us.

448
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,647
- All right, it's my turn to fly.
- Give it!

449
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,251
- I just want to buzz 'em.
- No!

450
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,818
Hey, you're gonna break it.

451
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,253
You want it? Fine!

452
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:51,253
Shit!

453
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:56,859
Ha!

454
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,861
No!

455
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:02,365
- Shit! What the hell, Thor?
- That was both of our faults.

456
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,137
Well, Dad's gonna kill me.
What do I do now?

457
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:07,771
- Whoa!
- What the hell?!

458
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:09,238
- We say there was a break-in.
- What...?

459
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,241
They trashed the place
and took the drone.

460
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:13,642
That's the most stupid
fucking idea I've ever heard!

461
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,311
Guys, guys.

462
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,214
All we have to do
is just go over there

463
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:19,349
and tell the truth,
then God will be on our side.

464
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,224
Hey. Can I help you?

465
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,725
Uh, I hope so, madam.

466
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,462
We were using our drone
to follow a family of turtles,

467
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:34,531
and we thought it might have
crashed in your backyard.

468
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,302
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here.
Come on in.

469
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,474
- So, you guys like turtles?
- Yeah.

470
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:47,276
- That's awesome.
- Time's up, motherfuckers.

471
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,512
Shit! It's a trap.

472
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:50,546
You think I give a fuck
about turtles?

473
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:52,682
We're sorry. We just wanted
to learn how to kiss.

474
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,251
Lucas, it's none
of their business.

475
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,752
We should have just
told the truth.

476
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:57,521
We're going to a kissing party,

477
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,622
and none of us have
ever kissed, and we're scared.

478
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:01,291
Goddamn it, Lucas.

479
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:04,761
I've had sex before,
but I've never kissed a girl.

480
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:07,429
Just go online and type in
"how to kiss."

481
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:08,732
That's what everyone does.

482
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:11,201
Oh.

483
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:12,903
It's very easy.

484
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,704
Look, can we please
have the drone back?

485
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,372
It's a BD Rolling Thunder.
It's my dad's.

486
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:18,507
He needs it for work.
Can I please have it back?

487
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,443
- I really need it. Please.
- I don't think so.

488
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:23,446
If you don't give it back,
I'll tell my dad you stole it.

489
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:25,447
And I'll tell him
that you're a pervert.

490
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:26,483
We'll tell the whole school.

491
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:28,484
This is sensual harassment.

492
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,520
We'll tell everyone
that you're a misogynist.

493
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:33,490
I never massaged anyone.

494
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:36,525
This is what happens
when you don't respect women.

495
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:38,962
I respect women.
My mom's my best friend.

496
00:22:38,964 --> 00:22:40,830
What about me?

497
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:43,500
Oh, God, I'm so fucked.

498
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,368
My dad's gonna kill me.

499
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,237
You had to snoop on them.
You're such a feminist.

500
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm-I'm not a feminist.
I love women.

501
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:53,243
And my parents are definitely
gonna call your guys' parents.

502
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:54,644
We're all gonna get grounded.

503
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:56,446
Forget Soren's party.
We're fucked.

504
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:59,416
Why are you smiling?
This is actually your fault.

505
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:01,786
This is leverage.

506
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,523
Oh.

507
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,326
Bingo.

508
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:11,594
- What is it?
- I have no idea.

509
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:12,928
That's a tampon.

510
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,965
- What's it for?
- Girls shove it

511
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,933
up their buttholes
to stop babies from coming out.

512
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:18,601
An eighth-grader told me that.

513
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:21,606
The human body
is truly a mystery.

514
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,742
Can't believe
they still eat chewables.

515
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:26,542
The gummies are so much better.

516
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,878
I like the chewables.
I want one.

517
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,260
Fucking childproof bullshit!

518
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:45,861
Thor! Thor!
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

519
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:55,437
It's the girls.

520
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:58,274
Hello?

521
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:01,378
You took my bag.
It has my license, my phone.

522
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,745
Bring it back right now.

523
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,880
Fuck that noise.
I want my drone back.

524
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:07,384
I got this.
I got this, I got this.

525
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:09,452
What did you
just say, you little bitch?

526
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:12,355
I'll take a shit
down your throat.

527
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:14,523
Why are you talking like that?

528
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,025
Hannah, I have
a little brother.

529
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:18,895
- You're supposed to scare them.
- Well, you scared me.

530
00:24:18,897 --> 00:24:21,497
Listen, we-we were just trying
to teach you a lesson.

531
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:24,067
I promise you we were gonna
give the drone back.

532
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,035
No way.
They could trick us again.

533
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:27,904
Or overpower us.

534
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:30,740
Oh, my God.
What if they take the Molly?

535
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:33,342
Then we wouldn't be able
to take it.

536
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:34,644
No, they're children.
They would die.

537
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,580
This is Max from earlier.

538
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:41,051
Meet us at the playground
across from John Adams

539
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:43,552
tomorrow at 7:40 a.m.

540
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:46,926
Bring the drone, and don't
fuck with the Bean Bag Boys.

541
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:50,560
- That was tough.
- Very tough.

542
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:52,428
I kind of got a boner
talking to those girls.

543
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,629
We're still on the phone.

544
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,898
- Shit! Fuck, fuck.
- What the shit?!

545
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,105
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

546
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:05,611
11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

547
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:19,557
Ow.

548
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,464
Don't come any closer.

549
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:30,132
- Why?
- 'Cause you could overpower us.

550
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:32,135
So, put the drone

551
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:34,704
on the slide, and count back
from a hundred,

552
00:25:34,706 --> 00:25:36,473
and close your eyes.

553
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:38,073
And don't try anything funny.

554
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,708
There are witnesses.

555
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,111
Okay, we have a long drive
ahead of us,

556
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,580
so give us the bag
or I will hurt you.

557
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:45,715
Do not test me.

558
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:47,817
Threats will get you nowhere,
peasant.

559
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,386
Just give us the fucking Molly!

560
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:52,955
Okay. Who's Molly?
'Cause she's not with us.

561
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:54,690
Guys.

562
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:58,727
Molly is a sex drug.
<i>Dateline</i> did an exposé on it.

563
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:02,599
You had us bring drugs
to a fucking playground?!

564
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:04,634
There are children here!

565
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:06,735
- Shit.
- It's okay.

566
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:08,036
I know what to do.

567
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:10,106
We're making
a citizen's arrest!

568
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:11,640
You're both under arrest!

569
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,942
- Get on the ground!
- Sweet Jesus.

570
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:14,444
- Up, up, up!
- Stay still!

571
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:16,178
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Stay still!

572
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,549
Get down now!
Get down now!

573
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,117
Did you just reload
your fake gun?

574
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,619
- Are you mocking me?
- Put your hands up!

575
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:23,786
Are you mocking me?!

576
00:26:23,788 --> 00:26:25,487
Anything will be used
against you

577
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:27,490
- that you say.
- In court.

578
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:28,957
You know, you're the one
holding drugs,

579
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,427
so why don't I do
a citizen's arrest on you?

580
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:32,861
Fuck.

581
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:34,664
Time-out, crackheads.

582
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,198
Oh, my God.

583
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,869
Deal's off. We can't let them
put drugs back on the street.

584
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:41,771
Look at those dirty
fucking junkies.

585
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,572
Their lives are already ruined.

586
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:45,742
Let's just give them the drugs
and get the drone.

587
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:48,878
Maybe there's a way we can

588
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,548
protect our community
and get the drone back.

589
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,515
Stall them.

590
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:57,520
So, what do you plan to do
with those drugs, huh?

591
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,555
Take 'em and feel amazing.

592
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:01,757
They're addicts.

593
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,091
Yeah.

594
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,895
So, you been drugging
your whole life?

595
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:07,930
- Uh-huh.
- E'r'day.

596
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:09,131
Oh. Nice.

597
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,766
What's he doing? Hey.

598
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:15,038
- Yes! Yes!
- It's working!

599
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,005
- It's working!
- Yes!

600
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:18,608
Fly it to the school!

601
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,176
You're heading for the trees! Watch out!

602
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,880
We're gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!

603
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:27,720
Fuck!

604
00:27:32,923 --> 00:27:34,957
Those girls are lucky
I didn't kick their asses.

605
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:37,593
Oh, no! They found us!

606
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:40,096
- Oh, shit.
- They're on school property.

607
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:42,168
They don't care.
They're tweaking.

608
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:46,569
You know who we need?

609
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:47,870
- No, don't say it.
- We'll look like losers.

610
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:49,872
- Don't say it. Don't say it.
- SCAB!

611
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:51,107
- Shut up.
- SCAB!

612
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,809
- Shut up. Zip it.
- Lucas, shut up.

613
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,610
- SCAB!
- What is that?

614
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:56,044
There's three boys in danger!

615
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:58,881
We're scared!
SCAB, help us!

616
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:00,884
We're okay.

617
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:02,551
- We're not scared. We're... we're fine.
- Lucas, shut up.

618
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:04,153
Just walking into school.

619
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:05,053
- Average day.
- Jesus Christ.

620
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:06,222
Bullying is wack.

621
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,558
Get on the right track.

622
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,092
Bullying is wack.

623
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:12,829
Get on the right track.

624
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:15,865
Bullying is wack.

625
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,734
Get on the right track.

626
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:21,140
Bullying is wack.

627
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:28,878
When you attack one of us,

628
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,612
you attack all of us.

629
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,215
Your weakness
gives us strength.

630
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:34,984
- Well, those kids stole my bag.
- Not today, bully!

631
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:37,719
Not today.

632
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:39,187
- What the fuck?
- Bullying is wack.

633
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,590
Get on the right track.

634
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:43,158
This is the best day
of my life.

635
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,593
Get on the right track.

636
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:46,931
Don't worry,
we'll find them later.

637
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,834
SCAB just tagged us
on Instagram.

638
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:55,204
First Sippy Cup, and now this?

639
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:58,006
I'm two weeks into sixth grade,
I'm already a social piranha.

640
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:00,275
Guys, my dad gets back at 5:00.

641
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:02,779
If we don't get a new drone
by then, I'm grounded.

642
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:05,013
Which means we're all grounded,
which means no party,

643
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:06,715
which means no Brixlee.

644
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:09,118
- Sippy Cup for life.
- No Brixlee,

645
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,286
no friends, no hope,

646
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:14,624
parents fighting,
trapped in our rooms,

647
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:17,859
all alone, two Taco Tuesdays.

648
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:21,166
So, Max, what are we gonna do?

649
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:25,834
We're gonna ditch school
and get a new drone.

650
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:27,971
Stop thinking with
your big old dick, Max.

651
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:29,973
That could go on
our permanent record.

652
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,942
Max's big old dick is pointing
us in the right direction.

653
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:35,978
Thank you. If anyone else
kisses Brixlee, I'll die.

654
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,914
Wait, what?
Here's the plan.

655
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,014
I'm gonna bring a beer
to Soren's,

656
00:29:39,016 --> 00:29:41,016
and I'm gonna sip that beer
so everyone will know...

657
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:43,653
That you're an alcoholic.

658
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:44,887
- That would be great.
- Guys.

659
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:46,656
The only place around here
that has one

660
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:47,790
is at North Point Galleria.

661
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,224
That's four miles away.

662
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:53,161
Four miles? How the fuck
are we getting four miles?

663
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,830
- You have Uber.
- No, it goes directly

664
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:56,799
to my mom's phone.
She'll know.

665
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:58,400
Then we bike.

666
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:01,272
Where are you even gonna get
the money for a new drone?

667
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,308
- What?
- You know.

668
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,677
Our Turzan of Uzkara card?
No way!

669
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,048
You said everyone wants
to buy it.

670
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,916
- We got it together.
- And we're gonna

671
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:15,685
sell it together, as friends.

672
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:16,918
Come on, Lucas.

673
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,289
Bean Bag Boys
do everything together.

674
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:21,724
Okay.

675
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,426
Guess that makes sense.

676
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:24,293
- Yes!
- Yes!

677
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:27,362
- Lucas! Bean Bag Boys for life.
- Yeah!

678
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,233
We're being so bad.

679
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,069
♪ We're bad, we're so bad ♪

680
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:35,303
♪ We're bad,
we're so bad ♪

681
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,742
♪ We're bad, we're so bad. ♪

682
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,823
I need to get rid
of these drugs.

683
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:57,326
- What are you doing?!
- Getting rid of the drugs!

684
00:30:57,328 --> 00:31:00,096
I'm just gonna throw them
in the stream.

685
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:01,930
It can contaminate the water.

686
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:03,366
Well, then we can throw it
in the forest.

687
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:04,501
It's a sex drug.

688
00:31:04,503 --> 00:31:07,203
What if a fox eats it
and tries to fuck a squirrel?

689
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:08,705
It'll kill him.

690
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:10,305
Well, then how do we
get rid of drugs?

691
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,407
The same way
we get rid of a baby.

692
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:13,709
- Abortion?
- Adoption?

693
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:14,910
No.

694
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,413
We drop it off at the firehouse
on our way up to the mall.

695
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,148
That's a really good idea.

696
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,984
Ah. I just got a bite
on our card.

697
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,721
Nice. Give 'em my address.

698
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,822
My parents aren't home,
and I have the best snacks.

699
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:29,358
PeterPan69 is gonna be here

700
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,293
in five minutes
to buy the card.

701
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:32,762
Well, let's get ready.

702
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:34,097
I found all of these weapons

703
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,868
in the back
of my parents' closet.

704
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:42,237
I still don't get
why we need weapons.

705
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,773
He could be a pedophile.

706
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:45,041
He can't molest
all three of us.

707
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,045
All he needs is one.

708
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:53,182
"An-al beads"?

709
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,984
Aka nunchucks, motherfucker.

710
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:57,219
Ooh.

711
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,856
- Yeah!
- It's not a toy.

712
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:03,826
Oh, shoot.

713
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:06,061
They smell like shit.

714
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:16,539
Hello.
Uh, I'm looking for Lucas.

715
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,175
- That's me.
- I'm Claude.

716
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:20,243
Hey.

717
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:22,811
That's my mom back there.

718
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,382
Hi-ya!

719
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,984
Let's cut the shit.
Are you a pedophile?

720
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:29,417
What? No.

721
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:31,020
Lucas, if you were a pedophile

722
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,554
standing in front
of three single boys,

723
00:32:32,556 --> 00:32:35,057
- would you admit it?
- Probably not.

724
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,292
Then why would he?

725
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:37,859
Oh, come on.

726
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:39,494
Do I look like a pedophile?

727
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:40,897
- Sure do.
- Yes, absolutely. - 1,000%.

728
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:42,497
That's not fair.

729
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:45,301
You look more like a pedophile
than anyone I've ever seen.

730
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:48,937
Look, I'm not a pedophile.
I'm a cool guy.

731
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:52,274
Fine. You can come in,
but please take your shoes off.

732
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:54,377
You know, I've searched
the world for this.

733
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:56,411
Why are you bringing
the paintball gun?

734
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:58,848
In case anyone fucks with us.

735
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,949
This card is exquisite.

736
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:03,151
- How'd you get it?
- The summer I moved here,

737
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:06,254
me, Max and Thor started
a dog-washing business.

738
00:33:06,256 --> 00:33:08,357
We earned eight bucks,
and we used the money

739
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,926
to buy an Ascension pack,
and this card was in it.

740
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,461
Well, you got very lucky.

741
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:14,563
The real luck
was meeting Max and Thor.

742
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:15,997
Fascinating.

743
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,265
We started calling ourself
the Bean Bag Boys.

744
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:20,369
- You know why?
- Because you had some beanbags?

745
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:22,972
- That's right.
- Yeah. Genius.

746
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:24,307
You got yourself a deal.

747
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:29,212
Let's go.
Let's make it happen.

748
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:34,349
No, I can't do this.

749
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:35,551
Sorry.

750
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:37,853
Lucas, get your butt
over here right now.

751
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:40,488
Excuse me, is this how all
12-year-olds conduct business?

752
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,858
What the hell just happened?

753
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,391
I thought you were cool
with this.

754
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:46,161
You said we wouldn't do this
if one of us wasn't on board.

755
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:48,496
- I'm not on board.
- Why do you care so much?

756
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:49,965
Why don't you care?

757
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,500
This card has
a lot of memories,

758
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:53,269
and you're just gonna
throw it all away

759
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,170
because you want to kiss
some basic girl?

760
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:56,472
Savage.

761
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,006
Brixlee isn't just some girl.

762
00:33:58,008 --> 00:33:59,609
We're probably
gonna get married.

763
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:02,177
Every marriage ends in divorce.

764
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:05,080
Lucas, you're outvoted.

765
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:07,215
Listen, I can tell
you're lashing out with anger,

766
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:09,151
but Brixlee is probably
the love of my life.

767
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:12,988
Excuse me, ma'am. Can I get
a glass of water, please?

768
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,293
Hello?

769
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:20,329
Hey, guys?

770
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:22,497
Hmm.

771
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:24,300
Yeah.

772
00:34:24,302 --> 00:34:26,167
What can you tell me
about her backstory?

773
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,303
Where is she supposed
to be from?

774
00:34:27,305 --> 00:34:28,336
She seems quite exotic.

775
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:30,939
Okay, listen carefully,

776
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:32,675
'cause I'll make this offer
only once.

777
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:35,044
400 bucks to take her
off your hands.

778
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:38,113
No. We need 550, U.S.

779
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,682
Fuck off. What?

780
00:34:39,684 --> 00:34:41,684
That's my entire allowance.

781
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:44,287
Listen, Claude,
let's just cut the bullshit.

782
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:47,455
I'm the son of a businesswoman,
and I think we both know,

783
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:49,457
if you didn't want
to buy the doll,

784
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:51,193
you would've left already.

785
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:54,129
Stop treating us like kids.
We know how things work.

786
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:57,600
So, do you want to buy
the CPR doll or not?

787
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:04,439
Fools.
I'd have paid a thousand.

788
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:07,209

00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:09,765
Are you okay?

833
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:11,200
- Are you okay?
- Lucas, are you okay?

834
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:12,834
- What the hell happened?
- We were running away

835
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:14,403
from our babysitter
'cause she was trying

836
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:16,171
- to touch our penises.
- What? That is not true.

837
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,506
- Yes, it is. - Yes, it is.
- I wasn't.

838
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:19,111
- Yeah, you were.
- I wasn't...

839
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,079
- Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go!
- What happened?

840
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,312
Go, go!

841
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:26,715
Lucas, are you okay?

842
00:37:26,717 --> 00:37:29,318
I-I think I'm fine.

843
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,820
- - Your arm.
- Oh, hell no.

844
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,591
Yo, I'm-a call 911.

845
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:37,792
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no. It's okay.

846
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:38,727
This happens all the time.

847
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,229
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go. Go.

848
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:42,097
- Help! Ow!
- We got... Come on.

849
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,200
I'll get the bikes.

850
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,137
Okay. I threw their phone
in a prickle bush.

851
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,704
So they can't track us anymore.

852
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:51,307
Oh, the pain!

853
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:52,608
Lucas, you have to be quiet.

854
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,176
Okay, do we have any ice?

855
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:56,412
No, we're in a fucking alley.

856
00:37:56,414 --> 00:37:58,780
What about pain medication?

857
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:01,216
- We have the Molly we can give him.
- No!

858
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:02,785
Yeah, he's probably just gonna
try and have sex with us.

859
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:04,120
Call an ambulance!

860
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,421
- Mission's over!
- We'll get busted.

861
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:08,858
- Plus, do you even have insurance?
- I don't know.

862
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,593
- Do you?
- I don't know.

863
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:12,595
- I think I only have a deductible.
- It's all right.

864
00:38:12,597 --> 00:38:14,597
This happens to MMA fighters
all the time.

865
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,798
We just got to ram your arm
into something very hard

866
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,503
so it pops back in place.

867
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:23,539
Fine! Fuck it!
Let's just get this over with.

868
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,673
Ow!

869
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:27,475
- Come on.
- Easy. All right.

870
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,845
One, two, three.

871
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:39,220
Wrong arm!

872
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:41,222
- Okay, new site, new site.
- Okay.

873
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:43,559
Okay, lie down on your back
and give me your arm.

874
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:45,660
Come on.

875
00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:48,564
All right. It says
this next part's gonna hurt,

876
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:50,733
that you should bite down
on something hard.

877
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:52,336
I know.

878
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,606
Open. There you go.

879
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:59,408
Okay.

880
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,410
- On three.
- One,

881
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,312
two, three.

882
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:04,479
- Just got a text from Taylor.
- What'd she say?

883
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,582
She wants to know
why you aren't in school

884
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:08,350
and if you're coming
to the party tonight.

885
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:09,651
Just write...

886
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:10,818
Okay, sorry.
One, two, three!

887
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,490
Oh!

888
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:15,557
Let me help, let me help.

889
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,791
- Focus! On three.
- One!

890
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:18,727
Two! Three!

891
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:24,200
Hmm?

892
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:28,607
Wow. I didn't think that'd actually work.

893
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:32,975
You're gonna be good, man.

894
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:35,577
No.

895
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,345
I'm really not.

896
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:40,317
My parents are getting
a divorce.

897
00:39:42,352 --> 00:39:43,686
What'd you do?

898
00:39:43,688 --> 00:39:45,820
- Thor!
- What?

899
00:39:45,822 --> 00:39:47,789
Sorry.

900
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:53,365
My dad's moving out.

901
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:57,733
Whatever happens
between your parents,

902
00:39:57,735 --> 00:39:59,905
you always got
the Bean Bag Boys.

903
00:40:01,872 --> 00:40:04,472
We'll never split up.
Bean Bag Boys for life.

904
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,441
You promise?

905
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:07,475
- Promise.
- Promise.

906
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:09,544
Come on.

907
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,713
Let's get you some
Children's Tylenol.

908
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:23,492
- Want some help, buddy?
- No, I got it.

909
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:25,727
Okay, just do it.

910
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:33,936
- Hey, Miles.
- Hey, man.

911
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:35,738
- Coming in or coming off?
- Just got off a triple.

912
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,740
Man, I don't care
if I get mugged.

913
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:39,910
I'm not typing up
any more paperwork today.

914
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:42,247
Cop.

915
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:47,483
Shit.
We have D-R-U-G-S on us.

916
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,684
He knows how to spell.
Just act normal.

917
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:52,287
- Pretend to talk.
- About what?

918
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:53,955
Just be normal.

919
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:56,892
What do you think
about politics?

920
00:40:56,894 --> 00:40:58,763
It's a complicated issue.

921
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:01,796
This cop's acting weird.

922
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:03,666
He's eye-fucking us.

923
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:05,033
Just act normal.
Just laugh.

924
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,901
We're just
two cool guys laughing.

925
00:41:12,677 --> 00:41:14,309
We skipped school.

926
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:15,477
Lucas!

927
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:18,347
Are we in trouble?

928
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:20,948
Yeah, well, usually,
I'd call this in,

929
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,352
but because you were
honest with me,

930
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:24,753
I'm gonna let you slide,
all right?

931
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,655
Just promise
not to do it again, okay?

932
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:28,457
We promise.
Thank you, sir.

933
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:29,291
All right.

934
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:31,026
That was a close one.

935
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:32,995

these are vitamins, okay?

Children's vitamins, at that.

00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:23,379

- Why are you yelling at me?

982
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,080
I just ran off
without my family's bikes.

983
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:36,084
- Cycle Sundays are fucked!
- Guys, guys.

984
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:37,553
The mall!

00:43:38,956 --> 00:43:40,988

- Yes!

987
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:45,160

Now we're trapped between
a highway and the authorities.

992
00:43:58,108 --> 00:43:59,908
Well, we wouldn't be
in this position right now

Guys, the mall's right there.

995
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,513
All we have to do
is cross the highway,

996
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:07,015
and the cars
aren't even moving.

997
00:44:07,017 --> 00:44:11,119

00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,075
Uh, no, you won't.

1004
00:44:33,077 --> 00:44:34,510
- Oh, my gosh!
- No, no.

1005
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:35,947
It's-it's like
a parking lot, see?

1006
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:39,548
Wait!
You stole another beer?

1007
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,015
- What the fuck, Thor?
- Hey.

1008
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:42,651
You guys aren't the ones
who's gonna have

1009
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:44,586
"Sippy Cup"
on their goddamn tombstone!

1010
00:44:44,588 --> 00:44:46,622
God.
Say it, don't spray it.

1011
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:50,791
Get off the freeway!

1012
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:51,926
Children crossing.

1013
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:53,662
- Please, children are crossing.
- Get off the road.

1014
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:58,166
- What are you guys doing? Get back to the side.
- Go!

1015
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:00,068
- Go, go, go, go. - Now.
- Fucking idiots!

1016
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,604
Wait. I got a message.

1017
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:04,939
Oh, it's from Taylor.

1018
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:06,675
She said Marcus is
coming to the party.

1019
00:45:06,677 --> 00:45:08,042
He has a huge crush on Brixlee.

1020
00:45:08,044 --> 00:45:10,044
She's definitely
gonna kiss him.

1021
00:45:10,046 --> 00:45:12,580
- He's the nicest kid in our grade.
- Wait, wait.

1022
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:13,981
I'm the nicest kid
in our grade.

1023
00:45:13,983 --> 00:45:18,086
It goes me, Marcus, Max, you.

1024
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:20,856
- I'm way nicer than Max.
- No, you're not!

1025
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:22,925
You made Ms. Willoughby cry
last year.

1026
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:25,026
Hey, she was already crying.
I just took her picture.

1027
00:45:25,028 --> 00:45:26,928
Guys, guys! Look!

1028
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,265
- It started.
- Oh, shit.

1029
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,800
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck.

1030
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:33,200
- Let's go back!
- Let's go back!

1031
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:35,803
We're trapped.

1032
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:37,842
Let us out!

1033
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:42,811
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

1034
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:45,079
- No, we're not. We just need to time it, okay?
- Oh, fuck!

1035
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:46,247
- We just need to time it right.
- Shit!

1036
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:48,986
We can do this, guys.
We can do this!

1037
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:52,620
N-No!

1038
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,091
- Max, no!
- Are you batshit crazy?!

1039
00:45:56,093 --> 00:45:58,327
What the fuck are you doing?!

1040
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:03,097
- Oh, shit. He made it.
- Oh!

1041
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:04,600
I did it!

1042
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:06,867
Lucas, Lucas,
look at me right now.

1043
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,070
I know you're scared.

1044
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:09,370
I'm not, at all...

1045
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:10,838
Shut up, Thor!

1046
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:15,276
- Lucas, fuck you! No!
- Shit! Shit!

1047
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:16,278
Lucas!

1048
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:21,048
No! Lucas!

1049
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,218
I'm not dead!

1050
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,620
- I'm not dead!
- All right.

1051
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:27,356
- You got it, man. Come on.
- Yes! Yes!

1052
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:29,624
- Fuck you!
- I love you, too.

1053
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:30,959
Now, come over here.

1054
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:32,126
I want my mom.

1055
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:33,695
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

1056
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:35,696
I'm fine.
I'll just live here.

1057
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:37,064
- I-I'm good.
- Come on!

1058
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:39,166
- Come on!
- You got this!

1059
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:41,003
All right. Come on, Thor.

1060
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:43,771
You are not Sippy Cup.
You're a badass.

1061
00:46:43,773 --> 00:46:46,073
Come on, come on!

1062
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:48,343
Oh, shit! My beer!

1063
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,023
Oh, shit!

1064
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,129
- Oh!
- Oh, wait.

1065
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,097
That's my dad's CPR doll.

1066
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,867
- Oh.
- That's my dad's CPR doll!

1067
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:13,669
- We're not murderers!
- Yes!

1068
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:15,236
- We're saved!
- We're not fucking killers!

1069
00:47:15,238 --> 00:47:17,204
- We're not killers!
- Yes!

1070
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:27,048
Beep, beep.

1071
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,316
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

1072
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:29,950
- Pardon me. Sorry.
- Hey!

1073
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:31,221
Excuse me.
Got to get through.

1074
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:33,358
Sorry.

1075
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:39,193
Hey. We called about
the BD Rolling Thunder.

1076
00:47:39,195 --> 00:47:41,296
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1077
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:43,131
Sold it.

1078
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,700
Ha-ha. Nice joke.

1079
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:46,367
So funny.

1080
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,403
No, I did. I sold it.
Two girls, said they knew you.

1081
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:51,305
Fuck you!

1082
00:47:51,307 --> 00:47:53,475
- Jesus.
- I'm gonna kill your family, and then they're

1083
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:55,276
- gonna come alive...
- Ease off the sugar, huh?

1084
00:47:55,278 --> 00:47:57,278
- ...and turn your whole family into zombies!
- Max!

1085
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,383
I was gonna say...
you didn't let me finish...

1086
00:48:01,385 --> 00:48:03,251
they left a note for you.

1087
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,492
Why are they walking like that?

1088
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:13,061
I don't know.

1089
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:18,200
How'd you guys track us?

1090
00:48:18,202 --> 00:48:19,767
We threw your bag
in prickle bushes.

1091
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,870
Dumbass, you told us
that your life would be over

1092
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:23,771
if you didn't get
a BD Rolling Thunder,

1093
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:25,173
and this is the only place

1094
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:27,408
- a child could get to on a tricycle.
- Okay.

1095
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,380
I have the drugs.
Now give me the drone.

1096
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:35,086
Are you fucking kidding me?

1097
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:40,155
What in the actual fuck?
These are just gummy vitamins.

1098
00:48:40,157 --> 00:48:41,356
- Shit.
- Told you she was gonna check.

1099
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:42,791
- Fuck.
- Where is the Molly?

1100
00:48:42,793 --> 00:48:45,160
- Where is it?
- A cop has it.

1101
00:48:45,162 --> 00:48:47,329
You gave our drugs to a cop?

1102
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:48,763
Wait. Look.

1103
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:50,097
I know you don't know us

1104
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,767
and you think
we're just stupid kids,

1105
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:52,834
but just listen to me.

1106
00:48:52,836 --> 00:48:54,269
Whatever problems
you're having,

1107
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,937
drugs are not the answer.

1108
00:48:55,939 --> 00:48:58,939
Drugs just give you
a false sense of reality.

1109
00:48:58,941 --> 00:49:00,941
You may think
your lives are bad,

1110
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:03,879
but you have family
and friends who love you.

1111
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:05,213
Can you shut the fuck up?

1112
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:07,082
I just spent $600
on a fucking drone.

1113
00:49:07,084 --> 00:49:08,816
You ruined
my passionate moment.

1114
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:11,820
- Well, it was stupid.
- This day is fucked.

1115
00:49:11,822 --> 00:49:13,088
Benji is the only one
who has Molly,

1116
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,256
and he won't sell it to us.

1117
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:16,091
Okay. Well, I'm sorry.

1118
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:17,825
We're fucked.

1119
00:49:17,827 --> 00:49:20,163
We'll do it.
We'll get your drugs.

1120
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:23,865
- The fuck we will.
- What the hell, dude?

1121
00:49:23,867 --> 00:49:25,533
Do you think
he would sell to kids?

1122
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:27,169
We're not kids.

1123
00:49:27,171 --> 00:49:28,370
We're tweens.

1124
00:49:28,372 --> 00:49:30,508
What do we have to lose?

1125
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:34,811
So, it's a deal?

1126
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:38,012
Max, this is fucking insane.

1127
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:39,548
Just take
your goddamn punishment.

1128
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,515
Lucas and I
will go to the party.

1129
00:49:41,517 --> 00:49:43,852
We'll cock-block anyone
that gets near Brixlee.

1130
00:49:43,854 --> 00:49:46,555
They didn't invite you.

1131
00:49:46,557 --> 00:49:48,289
What?

1132
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,392
The popular kids
only invited me.

1133
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:53,128
What do you mean?

1134
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,997
They think you're kind of...
random.

1135
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:58,133
- Oh.
- But it's okay,

1136
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:00,267
'cause once those guys
get to know you,

1137
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,470
they'll see what I see,
that you're not random.

1138
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:04,004
That you're specific.

1139
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:05,407
I'm not buying drugs.

1140
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,475
- Neither am I.
- You guys don't have to.

1141
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,443
I'll do all the talking. I just
need your height in there.

1142
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:11,412
You're the only one of us

1143
00:50:11,414 --> 00:50:13,481
that looks like
they could be in college.

1144
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:16,084
Guys.

1145
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:18,089
Are you in or out?

1146
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:22,256
So, you guys did all of this
for a kissing party?

1147
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:25,026
No. There's also gonna be
cool boys there.

1148
00:50:25,028 --> 00:50:26,861
I remember my first
kissing party.

1149
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:28,396
It was the summer
after sixth grade

1150
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:29,965
at Manush Patel's house.

1151
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:31,166
Who'd you kiss?

1152
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:33,300
Uh, Manush's sister.

1153
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:34,903
Wait, you weren't there?

1154
00:50:34,905 --> 00:50:36,403
No, we didn't really
know each other then.

1155
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:38,240
I mean, we were in
the same grade,

1156
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:40,242
but we didn't really become
close until eighth grade.

1157
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,376
Oh. I just figured you guys

1158
00:50:42,378 --> 00:50:44,479
- knew each other for longer.
- Yeah, everybody knows

1159
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,548
you meet your best friends
in kindergarten.

1160
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,115
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the only reason

1161
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:49,416
you're friends with people
back then

1162
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:51,051
is 'cause you live close
to each other.

1163
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:52,254
Or, because, like,
your parents are friends.

1164
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:54,122
No. That's not true for us.

1165
00:50:54,124 --> 00:50:56,124
We're friends
because we like each other.

1166
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:59,494
- And we live close together.
- And our parents are friends.

1167
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,138
Okay, come here.

1168
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,908
Go in. Buy two pills.

1169
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,343
Ask for Benji.

1170
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:16,945
Do not mention Hannah.

1171
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:19,247
- Who's Hannah?
- I am.

1172
00:51:19,249 --> 00:51:21,548
Oh. I'm Max.

1173
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,050
Yeah, I know who you are.

1174
00:51:23,052 --> 00:51:25,287
Okay, just go in there,
buy the pills,

1175
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,191
and then I'll trade you
for the drone.

1176
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:32,327
Okay, if this goes bad,
drive off.

1177
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:33,928
- Okay.
- Okay.

1178
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,696
It's not too late to turn back.

1179
00:51:35,698 --> 00:51:37,698
No. We have to get the drugs

1180
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,035
so we can get the drone,
so we can go to the party.

1181
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:05,930
Hello?

1182
00:52:13,736 --> 00:52:15,637
I am your daddy!

1183
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,638
You are my baby!

1184
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,108
Listen, you will stay
down here and suffer

1185
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,242
until you learn to be men!

1186
00:52:24,581 --> 00:52:27,414
Listen!
What you babies wearing?

1187
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:29,651
- Diapers!
- That's right!

1188
00:52:31,454 --> 00:52:34,622
Good evening.
We're looking for Benji.

1189
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:39,260
Hey, dickless. Come here.

1190
00:52:39,262 --> 00:52:42,129
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right, I need you to go find Benji.

1191
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:43,597
Tell him he's got visitors.

1192
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,265
Yes, Daddy.

1193
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:47,234
I ask the fucking questions!

1194
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:48,769
That's your son?

1195
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:52,240
You guys can go sit your
asses down over there and wait.

1196
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:55,075
Whatever happens to you is

1197
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:56,378
your own fucking fault.

1198
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,713
Drop and give me 20,
you fucking babies!

1199
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,251
Listen!

1200
00:53:03,253 --> 00:53:06,021
Four! Get up!

1201
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,024
Can I help you?

1202
00:53:09,026 --> 00:53:10,358
Good afternoon.

1203
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,997
We would like to buy
two pieces of Molly, please.

1204
00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:20,068
Did Rafi from Sigma Nu
send you?

1205
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,301
He did, that fucker.

1206
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:23,271
You guys are, like, seven.

1207
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:25,173
Oh, except for you.
I recognize you from econ.

1208
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:26,276
What's up, man?

1209
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,378
Seriously,
I'm not selling drugs to kids.

1210
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,148
We're not kids.
We're tweens.

1211
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:35,749
Who told you to come here?

1212
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:38,621
Sell us the drugs,
and you'll find out.

1213
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:44,595
All right.

1214
00:53:45,628 --> 00:53:47,428
Stay there.

1215
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:54,803
Hey.

1216
00:53:54,805 --> 00:53:57,508
How long do you think
he's gonna be?

1217
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:04,546
Oh, you made me high.

1218
00:54:13,356 --> 00:54:15,256
Ah.

1219
00:54:15,258 --> 00:54:17,528
Tell me who sent you.

1220
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:21,729
Hannah.

1221
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:23,530
What? I'm high as fuck.

1222
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:27,869
So, this is what
she thinks of me, huh?

1223
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:31,840
You can tell Hannah
that if she wants Molly,

1224
00:54:31,842 --> 00:54:33,575
she can suck my dick.

1225
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:36,144
You shouldn't talk about
women like that.

1226
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:38,245
The only time
she should suck your dick

1227
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:40,150
is when she gives you consent.

1228
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:43,283
You can suck my dick,

1229
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:45,285
and you can suck
my dick, too.

1230
00:54:45,287 --> 00:54:47,624
What about me?
I'm just gonna sit here?

1231
00:54:49,726 --> 00:54:52,227
We're the Bean Bag Boys.
We do everything together.

1232
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:54,495
Get the fuck out of here,
you little fucking babies.

1233
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:55,499
Let's go.

1234
00:54:56,566 --> 00:54:58,566
Get out!

1235
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,704
Hey, guys, wait.

1236
00:55:02,706 --> 00:55:04,372
I have something in here

1237
00:55:04,374 --> 00:55:06,707
that might change your mind.

1238
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:08,475
Hurry up.

1239
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:10,211
Pledges, listen!

1240
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:12,280
Bitch! Now who's the baby?!

1241
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:14,381
- Holy shit.
- What the fuck?

1242
00:55:14,383 --> 00:55:16,550
If I don't get those drugs,
I'm gonna be grounded,

1243
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:18,720
and then I'll never
get to kiss Brixlee!

1244
00:55:18,722 --> 00:55:21,356
Max, what the fuck
are you doing?

1245
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:23,591
You sell drugs.
We came here to buy them.

1246
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:26,294
So now you're gonna
sell us the drugs.

1247
00:55:26,296 --> 00:55:28,363
Do not test me!

1248
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:30,301
Okay.

1249
00:55:32,434 --> 00:55:34,501
You want the drugs?
I'm not your parent. Here.

1250
00:55:34,503 --> 00:55:35,769
Thanks.

1251
00:55:35,771 --> 00:55:37,373
Oh, shit.

1252
00:55:38,675 --> 00:55:39,908
Oh, you're fucking dead.

1253
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,879
What the fuck's going on
down here?

1254
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:47,414
Whoa!

1255
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:49,450
She just dropped the charges.

1256
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:50,751
Oh, God.

00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:10,537
I got your back.

1263
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:11,838
Thor!

1264
00:56:14,811 --> 00:56:16,577
Your ass is mine!

1265
00:56:20,249 --> 00:56:22,383
Oh, my God,
I just killed a man!

1266
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:23,952

00:56:34,597 --> 00:56:37,365

- Fucking go!

1273
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:38,832

- Shit, shit, shit!

1274
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:41,970

00:56:50,947 --> 00:56:53,416
Lucas, drugs.

1276
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,617
No, no, no, no, no.

1277
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:56,950
Let me see
what's in the bottle.

1278
00:56:56,952 --> 00:57:00,323
Yeah. Of course.

1279
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:05,026
Okay, just-just give it to me.

1280
00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:13,600
Wow, you guys are
little badasses.

1281
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:15,736
'Cause we're the Bean Bag Boys.

1282
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:17,738
I don't know what that means.

1283
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,943
We have beanbags.

1284
00:57:21,778 --> 00:57:22,846
It's been real, guys.

1285
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:25,812
Have fun at your kissing party.

1286
00:57:25,814 --> 00:57:27,515
Thank you.

1287
00:57:31,621 --> 00:57:34,724
Oh.
We're only 1.7 miles away.

1288
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,059
What's wrong?

1289
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:40,662
We got the drone.
Everything worked out.

1290
00:57:40,664 --> 00:57:42,329
Max.

1291
00:57:42,331 --> 00:57:45,033
I got punched
in the fucking face, okay?

1292
00:57:45,035 --> 00:57:47,401
We bought drugs.

1293
00:57:47,403 --> 00:57:49,437
Can we just go home now?

1294
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:03,450
Guys, it's my dad.

1295
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:04,751
Hey, Dad.

1296
00:58:04,753 --> 00:58:06,421
Hey, buddy.
I got on the early flight,

1297
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:08,523
so I'll be home in 15 minutes.

1298
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:10,925
15 minutes from now
or 15 minutes from later?

1299
00:58:10,927 --> 00:58:13,061
Ha-ha, funny guy.

1300
00:58:13,063 --> 00:58:14,829
I'll see you soon.

1301
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:17,030
My dad will be home
in 15 minutes.

1302
00:58:17,032 --> 00:58:19,700
M-Maybe he won't notice
that the drone's gone.

1303
00:58:19,702 --> 00:58:21,702
He'll notice.
He's very observant.

1304
00:58:21,704 --> 00:58:24,472
That's why my mom
fell in love with him.

1305
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:26,474
The drone has to be home
before your dad.

1306
00:58:26,476 --> 00:58:28,108
I know.

1307
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,678
Just the drone. Not you.

1308
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,050
Just the drone.

1309
00:58:37,052 --> 00:58:39,355
Okay.

1310
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:43,423
Here we go.

1311
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:45,392
- Yes!
- Yes!

1312
00:58:48,831 --> 00:58:50,800
- Careful.
- I got this, I got this. Oh!

1313
00:58:52,802 --> 00:58:54,470
Fly like the wind, Max.

1314
00:58:55,572 --> 00:58:57,707
Yeah, uh, take a right up here.

1315
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:01,608
- I can see your house.
- There it is. There it is.

1316
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,577
The windows are closed.

1317
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,515
- Shit. What do I do?
- The chimney.

1318
00:59:11,086 --> 00:59:14,155
- It's very tight.
- You got this.

1319
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:15,523
Shit! I can't see.
I can't see.

1320
00:59:15,525 --> 00:59:17,425
There's ash
all over the camera.

1321
00:59:17,427 --> 00:59:18,593
Use the Force.

1322
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:19,727
- No, no, I can do this.
- Uh...

1323
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:20,928
I know my house perfectly.

1324
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,729
- I can do this with my eyes closed.
- Okay.

1325
00:59:22,731 --> 00:59:24,131
Don't break anything.

1326
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:26,033
Trust me, I got this.

1327
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,952
- Yeah!
- You did it! You got it!

1328
00:59:44,954 --> 00:59:47,021
- Yes!
- I'm the best pilot ever!

1329
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:48,455
Yes!

1330
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:58,733
- I think we did it.
- Yeah.

1331
00:59:58,735 --> 01:00:00,901
Mission accomplished.

1332
01:00:00,903 --> 01:00:03,204
Hey, Dad.

1333
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:05,205
Did you get home safe?

1334
01:00:05,207 --> 01:00:07,841
Cannot believe I trusted you!

1335
01:00:07,843 --> 01:00:09,010
I explicitly told you,

1336
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:10,544
- do not touch the drone!
- Uh-huh.

1337
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:13,046
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

1338
01:00:13,048 --> 01:00:14,782
Dad?

1339
01:00:14,784 --> 01:00:17,852
Dad, please...
say "I love you" back.

1340
01:00:17,854 --> 01:00:19,490
I need to hear it.

1341
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,593
Hello?

1342
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:27,727
My dad said that I'm grounded.

1343
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:30,564
Now I'm never gonna be able
to kiss Brixlee.

1344
01:00:30,566 --> 01:00:32,966
It's okay, Max.
There'll be other parties.

1345
01:00:32,968 --> 01:00:35,669
- Lucas, you don't get it.
- He's right, Lucas.

1346
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:37,137
This party could
change our lives,

1347
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:38,673
and you don't even care.

1348
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:40,173
It's not cool at all.

1349
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:41,975
Yeah, you would know
what's not cool.

1350
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:43,577
What the fuck does that mean?

1351
01:00:43,579 --> 01:00:45,512
Go sip a beer, Sippy Cup.

1352
01:00:45,514 --> 01:00:48,515
I love beer, so yes, I will.

1353
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:50,952
And you may think you're
so mature, but the truth is

1354
01:00:50,954 --> 01:00:53,187
you don't have pubes,
and I have six.

1355
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:55,890
You say you have pubes,
but you also say

1356
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:57,524
you drink beer,
and I know you don't.

1357
01:00:57,526 --> 01:01:00,794
- Stop arguing!
- Just admit you skipped the audition

1358
01:01:00,796 --> 01:01:01,995
because you thought
it wasn't cool

1359
01:01:01,997 --> 01:01:03,631
even though your voice
is a fucking gift.

1360
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:06,767
And you always talk a big game,
and you never back it up.

1361
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:09,035
- Like on the freeway.
- Oh, sorry.

1362
01:01:09,037 --> 01:01:10,271
I didn't want to cross
12 lanes of traffic

1363
01:01:10,273 --> 01:01:13,106
so you can kiss some skank.

1364
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:14,975
- Oh, shit.
- She's not a skank.

1365
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:16,943
She's the love of my life.
You take that back!

1366
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:18,678
Hey, no karate.

1367
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,648
Stop fighting!

1368
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,050
You should never
call a woman a skank.

1369
01:01:23,052 --> 01:01:25,952
You should never call
a woman anything.

1370
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:28,055
And you...

1371
01:01:28,057 --> 01:01:31,024
You made us ditch school,
run around with drugs,

1372
01:01:31,026 --> 01:01:33,794
and lock a cop
in a convenience store

1373
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:36,296
with what I now suspect
is a dildo!

1374
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:40,667
What the fuck are you
looking at, Gandalf?!

1375
01:01:40,669 --> 01:01:43,537
You guys don't understand shit.

1376
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,273
I have hormones
flowing through my body,

1377
01:01:45,275 --> 01:01:46,941
making me do crazy things.

1378
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:49,544
Do you even know
what it feels like

1379
01:01:49,546 --> 01:01:52,146
to want to rub up
against a tree all the time?

1380
01:01:52,148 --> 01:01:53,280
You think
you're better than us.

1381
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:55,615
Not better, just more mature.

1382
01:01:55,617 --> 01:01:57,684
I'm into romance
and grown-up shit,

1383
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,921
and you guys are still
into little kid stuff.

1384
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:01,789
I don't even know
why we're still friends.

1385
01:02:29,017 --> 01:02:32,753
Everything you like
is now canceled.

1386
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:35,990
Birthdays are canceled.
Holidays are canceled.

1387
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:38,191
Summers, canceled.

1388
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:39,827
Winter is coming.

1389
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:41,662
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- No, no, no.

1390
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:43,965
You are no longer allowed
to call me Daddy.

1391
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,233
Call me Andrew
or Mr. Newman or Warden.

1392
01:02:47,235 --> 01:02:50,972
Underneath that cherubic face,
Devil lives inside you.

1393
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:56,276
I will always love you
because you are my son,

1394
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:58,314
but I no longer like you.

1395
01:03:05,188 --> 01:03:09,293
Thorny. I just got off
the phone with Max's mom.

1396
01:03:10,892 --> 01:03:12,126
Did you know he skipped school

1397
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:13,628
and biked to the mall
by himself?

1398
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,129
- He said that?
- He did.

1399
01:03:15,131 --> 01:03:16,830
Promise me
you'll never do something

1400
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:19,066
as stupid as that, okay?

1401
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:20,704
I-I promise.

1402
01:03:24,307 --> 01:03:26,039
And then
we ran across the highway,

1403
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,774
my arm got ripped out,

1404
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:30,176
and a fake woman
shot out of a car.

1405
01:03:30,178 --> 01:03:32,213
But we still got the drugs.

1406
01:03:32,215 --> 01:03:33,881
But then we traded
the drone for it,

1407
01:03:33,883 --> 01:03:35,349
and-and Max destroyed
his house with it.

1408
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:38,218
But it was only because
he wanted to marry Brixlee,

1409
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,854
and now he can't
because he's grounded for life.

1410
01:03:40,856 --> 01:03:42,222
And we got into a huge fight,

1411
01:03:42,224 --> 01:03:43,758
and the Bean Bag Boys
are broke up, and...

1412
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,392
- Am I in trouble?
- Okay, son.

1413
01:03:45,394 --> 01:03:48,294
Now, look, I love a good story
with a bunch of gibberish

1414
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:49,997
just as much as anybody, okay?

1415
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:51,966
And I know you're going through
a stressful time.

1416
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:54,267
But it doesn't give you
a reason to tell us fibs.

1417
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:55,870
I'm not fibbing.

1418
01:03:55,872 --> 01:03:58,104
I'm 100% sure
you're fibbing to me.

1419
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:00,207
- I'm not fibbing.
- Okay. I think I understand

1420
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:01,709
what's happening here.

1421
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:03,711
You think you're losing us,

1422
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:06,213
and now you're worried you're
gonna lose your friends, too.

1423
01:04:06,215 --> 01:04:07,981
Look at me, man.

1424
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:09,816
We'll always be there, right?
I mean, and look,

1425
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:10,617
don't get me wrong.

1426
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:12,119
You know,
me and your mom are not

1427
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:13,720
the same people we were
when we first met.

1428
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:14,921
Mm-hmm.

1429
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:16,256
Tend to grow apart sometimes.

1430
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:17,925
But-but it's okay.

1431
01:04:17,927 --> 01:04:19,225
You remember your hermit crab?

1432
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:21,829
- Herman? Yeah.
- That's right. Herman.

1433
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:24,465
- And you remember why he died?
- Oh, son of a...

1434
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:26,399
You told me he ran away!

1435
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:29,070
Technically, yes,
he ran away, but then he died.

1436
01:04:29,072 --> 01:04:30,370
Oh, my gosh. How?

1437
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:33,039
Herman died
because hermit crabs

1438
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,776
grow out of their shells,
and they need to find

1439
01:04:35,778 --> 01:04:37,745
new, bigger seashells
on the beach

1440
01:04:37,747 --> 01:04:40,314
to grow into, or they die,
and we didn't know that.

1441
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:43,483
So, Herman died
because of you guys?

1442
01:04:43,485 --> 01:04:45,119
The point is...

1443
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:47,220
you and your friends
are growing and changing,

1444
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:49,189
and y'all need to find
bigger shells.

1445
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:51,225
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

1446
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:53,359
Okay, look, you need to blame

1447
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,829
those pet store owners, okay,
because they did not give us

1448
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:58,134
the information
about hermit crabs...

1449
01:05:12,081 --> 01:05:14,749
It's Lucas.

1450
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,483
You scared the shit out of me.

1451
01:05:16,485 --> 01:05:19,887
I didn't want
your parents to see my face.

1452
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:21,888
Why are you even here?

1453
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,890
I've grown a lot
in the last two hours.

1454
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:25,526
My parents' divorce
has really changed me.

1455
01:05:25,528 --> 01:05:27,294
If the Bean Bag Boys
don't grow together,

1456
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:29,095
they'll grow apart.

1457
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:30,830
I don't want that.

1458
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:33,399
I don't want to get
a divorce from you.

1459
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,535
Then you need to go
to Soren's party.

1460
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:38,338
- You need to sneak out.
- I can't. I'm grounded.

1461
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,975
Besides, Brixlee's necklace
is still in the kiln.

1462
01:05:40,977 --> 01:05:43,343
Let me worry about
the necklace.

1463
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:45,347
And what are your parents
gonna do, double-ground you?

1464
01:05:46,948 --> 01:05:49,251
Is Brixlee your forever or not?

1465
01:05:50,986 --> 01:05:53,086
Then you need to come
with me now.

1466
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:56,256
Fine, I'll go, but I'm not
apologizing to Thor.

1467
01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:59,225
- He's not coming.
- Good.

1468
01:05:59,227 --> 01:06:01,227
Fuck that bitch.

1469
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:03,530
I'll go get my jacket.

1470
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:05,999
- Hey, Max.
- Yeah?

1471
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:07,837
Bring that dick.

1472
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,910
You said Thor wasn't coming.

1473
01:06:16,912 --> 01:06:18,245
What the hell is he doing here?

1474
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:19,280
I Parent-Trapped your asses.

1475
01:06:19,282 --> 01:06:20,548
See, now we're all in

1476
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,419
a bigger hermit crab shell
together.

1477
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:25,852
It made sense
when my parents said it.

1478
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,854
So, you took the blame
for us, huh?

1479
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:29,356
Yeah. I thought about

1480
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,392
what you would do,
and did the opposite.

1481
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:34,894
This party, it's gonna be
an epic rager.

1482
01:06:34,896 --> 01:06:36,396
Okay, Sippy Cup.

1483
01:06:36,398 --> 01:06:39,001
Just stay out of my way,
Maxi Pad.

1484
01:06:49,211 --> 01:06:52,379
Aw, don't you boys look cute.

1485
01:06:52,381 --> 01:06:54,381
Everybody's in the basement.

1486
01:06:54,383 --> 01:06:56,850
I don't even want to know
what's going on down there.

1487
01:06:56,852 --> 01:06:58,519
Come on in, fellas.

1488
01:06:58,521 --> 01:07:00,387
Hi.

1489
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:01,988

Max, I want you
to meet Brixlee.

1499
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:31,184
Hi. I'm Max.

1500
01:07:31,186 --> 01:07:33,320
Hi.

1501
01:07:33,322 --> 01:07:35,455
It's nice to finally meet you.

1502
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:36,923
You, too.

1503
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:38,626
Cool jacket.

1504
01:07:38,628 --> 01:07:40,327
Thank you.

1505
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:43,430
I got it all by myself,
with my mom.

1506
01:07:43,432 --> 01:07:46,200
I go shopping with my mom, too.

1507
01:07:46,202 --> 01:07:48,371
This is going so well.

1508
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:52,075
Did you bring the necklace?

1509
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:56,075
Brixlee, this is for you.

1510
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:58,945
Oh, thanks. It's pretty.

1511
01:07:58,947 --> 01:08:00,113
They're an-al.

1512
01:08:00,115 --> 01:08:01,414
Ooh, fancy.

1513
01:08:04,486 --> 01:08:06,986
I'm gonna wear this later.

1514
01:08:06,988 --> 01:08:08,454
Thanks, Max.

1515
01:08:08,456 --> 01:08:11,057
What's up, Sippy Cup?

1516
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,959
Not much.

1517
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:14,561
Just, uh, got into a fight

1518
01:08:14,563 --> 01:08:18,132
with a bunch of men
and, uh, stole a beer.

1519
01:08:18,134 --> 01:08:21,168
There's no way Sippy Cup
is gonna drink it.

1520
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,503
Not only am I gonna drink it,

1521
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:26,205
I'm gonna break the record.

1522
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:29,476
I'm gonna take four sips.

1523
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,110
Four is impossible.

1524
01:08:31,112 --> 01:08:33,379
- Soren can't even do four.
- Shut up.

1525
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:35,919
Drink.

1526
01:08:52,735 --> 01:08:54,267
That's one.

1527
01:08:54,269 --> 01:08:56,473
Big deal.

1528
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:00,610
That's two.

1529
01:09:01,744 --> 01:09:04,014
Mm-kay.

1530
01:09:08,718 --> 01:09:10,284
That's three!

1531
01:09:10,286 --> 01:09:12,086
This is insane.

1532
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:14,488
He's gonna barf.

1533
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,289
Somebody get him a sippy cup.

1534
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:19,193
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

1535
01:09:19,195 --> 01:09:22,695
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!
Sippy Cup!

1536
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:25,632
Sippy Cup!
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

1537
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:27,767
Sippy Cup! Sippy...

1538
01:09:27,769 --> 01:09:29,770
That's fucking four!

1539
01:09:29,772 --> 01:09:31,739
Oh, fuck!

1540
01:09:31,741 --> 01:09:33,474
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

1541
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:35,441
Thor! Thor!
Thor! Thor! Thor!

1542
01:09:35,443 --> 01:09:37,711
I'm a fucking alcoholic!

1543
01:09:40,415 --> 01:09:41,648
No way!

1544
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:43,617
Four sips. Badass.

1545
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:44,752
Mad respect to Thor.

1546
01:09:44,754 --> 01:09:46,587
Eyes up here.

1547
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:49,489
If you don't consent
to kissing, that's cool.

1548
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:51,557
You can go play VR upstairs.

1549
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:53,159
But if you're staying
down here,

1550
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:54,595
you better strap in,

1551
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:56,430
because shit's about
to get real.

1552
01:09:56,432 --> 01:09:58,065
- Hell yeah.
- Okay.

1553
01:09:58,067 --> 01:09:59,466
Let's spin a bottle.

1554
01:09:59,468 --> 01:10:02,703
Well, then it's a good thing
I got a bottle right here!

- Wait, where are you going?
- That was nasty.

1562
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:36,369
I'm going upstairs to play VR.

1563
01:10:36,371 --> 01:10:38,638
If you leave,
you can never come back.

1564
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,478
Oh, no.

1565
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,418
Brixlee...

1566
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,418
your turn.

1567
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:03,465
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1568
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:32,327
Oh, my God. This is the most
dramatic thing I've ever seen.

1569
01:11:34,897 --> 01:11:36,800
He's not gonna do it.

1570
01:11:38,601 --> 01:11:39,669
He's gonna do it.

1571
01:11:41,336 --> 01:11:43,669
I can't do it.

1572
01:11:45,273 --> 01:11:47,708
People don't change.
He's still Sippy Cup.

1573
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,575
Wait, wait.

1574
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:50,843
Kissy Cup.

1575
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:52,279
Kissy Cup!

1576
01:11:52,281 --> 01:11:54,448
Kissy Cup! Kissy Cup!

1577
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,916
Kissy Cup! Kissy...

1578
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:58,217
Fuck off, Atticus!
His name is Thor.

1579
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:00,520
And everyone knows your mom
plagiarized her cookbook.

1580
01:12:00,522 --> 01:12:02,491
Thor, wait up.

1581
01:12:07,897 --> 01:12:10,596
I'm sorry I called you
a try-hard.

1582
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:12,932
Nah, you were right.

1583
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:14,668
This whole time,
I've been trying

1584
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,306
to be someone who I wasn't.

1585
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,573
I got an earring.

1586
01:12:19,575 --> 01:12:21,708
I drank a beer.

1587
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,776
I quit singing.

1588
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:25,546
Yeah.

1589
01:12:25,548 --> 01:12:27,914
I guess I went
a little crazy today, too.

1590
01:12:31,519 --> 01:12:33,553
Let's get out of here.

1591
01:12:33,555 --> 01:12:36,657
No.
You don't want to do that.

1592
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:39,525
You're gonna stay down here
and kiss Brixlee.

1593
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:43,198
The Bean Bag Boys
do everything together.

1594
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:45,766
Not everything.

1595
01:12:45,768 --> 01:12:47,637
Not anymore.

1596
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,907
Maybe those old girls
were right.

1597
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:56,443
Maybe we're on
different paths.

1598
01:12:56,445 --> 01:12:59,312
Yeah.

1599
01:12:59,314 --> 01:13:00,782
Then what are you gonna do?

1600
01:13:02,483 --> 01:13:05,351
I don't know.
I just know it's not this.

1601
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:07,320
No way.

1602
01:13:07,322 --> 01:13:08,454
This is insane.

1603
01:13:08,456 --> 01:13:10,257
Forget spin the bottle.

1604
01:13:10,259 --> 01:13:13,596
Now, go over there
and kiss your future wife.

1605
01:13:15,397 --> 01:13:18,231
Bye.

1606
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:20,236
Bye.

1607
01:13:46,762 --> 01:13:49,933
Brixlee, can I kiss you?

1608
01:13:51,433 --> 01:13:52,769
Okay.

1609
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:24,030
Cool.

1610
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:25,899
Where am I?

1611
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:27,668
Oh, here I am.

1612
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:30,069
Lucas, I'm leaving.

1613
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:31,937
You sure you don't want
to try this?

1614
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:33,610
Nah, I'm good.

1615
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:40,047
Want to go to my house
and play Ascension?

1616
01:14:40,049 --> 01:14:42,952
I don't want to play
Ascension anymore.

1617
01:14:44,018 --> 01:14:46,052
Then who am I gonna play with?

1618
01:14:46,054 --> 01:14:47,721
You'll find someone.

1619
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:50,990
My face feels so tingly.

1620
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:52,859
No way.

1621
01:14:52,861 --> 01:14:55,061
Oh, my God.
This is amazing!

1622
01:14:55,063 --> 01:14:57,631
I can't believe
you guys are here.

1623
01:14:57,633 --> 01:14:59,632
Oh, this is so amazing.

1624
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:03,002
- Hi. - Oh, hi.
- Sit down.

1625
01:15:03,004 --> 01:15:04,604
Please no, please no.
Don't kill us.

1626
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:05,838
Look what happened.

1627
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,908
How do you know Soren?

1628
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:10,510
Is he your boyfriend?

1629
01:15:10,512 --> 01:15:13,713
He's my brother.
I love that piece of shit.

1630
01:15:19,655 --> 01:15:21,754
You guys,
where's everybody else?

1631
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:24,056
Where's your friend
with the sad eyes?

1632
01:15:24,058 --> 01:15:26,525
- Sad boy Max.
- In the basement kissing.

1633
01:15:26,527 --> 01:15:28,395
It's an orgy down there.

1634
01:15:28,397 --> 01:15:29,796
And you guys aren't into that?

1635
01:15:29,798 --> 01:15:31,765
- Mm-mm.
- Aw, it's okay.

1636
01:15:31,767 --> 01:15:32,998
You're only in sixth grade.

1637
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,435
You guys are gonna
figure it out.

1638
01:15:35,437 --> 01:15:37,738
- Yeah, you have your whole life for that. No rush.
- Yeah.

1639
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,771
- No rush.
- No rush.

1640
01:15:38,773 --> 01:15:41,440
I mean, what do you love?

1641
01:15:41,442 --> 01:15:45,878
Ascension, rules,
antidrug campaigns...

1642
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,681
grilled cheese.

1643
01:15:47,683 --> 01:15:49,548
- Mmm.
- Oh, I could fuck with a grilled cheese right now.

1644
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,784
- Aw...
- Guys, I'm gonna make us grilled cheese.

1645
01:15:50,786 --> 01:15:52,953
- Oh, yeah. That sounds so good.
- Nice.

1646
01:15:52,955 --> 01:15:55,154
What about you, sleeveless?
What are you into?

1647
01:15:55,156 --> 01:15:57,591
I love to sing.

1648
01:15:57,593 --> 01:15:58,958
Yes.

1649
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,694
I actually skipped

1650
01:16:00,696 --> 01:16:02,462
my audition today
for the musical.

1651
01:16:02,464 --> 01:16:04,431
- No.
- Now I can't be in it.

1652
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:05,998
- No.
- What? You have to

1653
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,700
convince them
to let you audition.

1654
01:16:07,702 --> 01:16:09,636
You must. You must.

1655
01:16:09,638 --> 01:16:10,703
- Audition.
- Shh. Sing for us.

1656
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:11,504
- No.
- Oh, my God.

1657
01:16:11,506 --> 01:16:12,939
Sing for us.
You're a baby bird.

1658
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:13,907
No, come on.
We missed our concert.

1659
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:16,142
- Sing for us.
- So, no grilled cheese?

1660
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:17,543
- Sing for us. Sing for us.
- No.

1661
01:16:17,545 --> 01:16:18,548

You know I'd never miss
one of your shows.

1714

Thank you.

Oh, sorry.
Thor, this is Scout.

1717
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:31,664
- You were really good.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1718
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:33,302
I was much better
in the matinee.

1719

01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:42,909
It ended yesterday.
A month in the hole.

1722
01:20:42,911 --> 01:20:45,278
Thanks again
for taking the fall.

1723
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,180
You would've done the same.

1724

Look who's here. Me.

1726
01:20:50,852 --> 01:20:53,352
Hey!

1727
01:20:53,354 --> 01:20:55,691
Feels like we haven't
talked in weeks.

1728
01:20:57,259 --> 01:20:58,925
Yeah.

1729
01:20:58,927 --> 01:21:00,092
Max.

1730
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:02,328
My mom said she'll drop us
at frozen yogurt

1731
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,064
if your mom will pick us up.

1732
01:21:04,066 --> 01:21:05,765
Great.
Be there in a second, babe.

1733
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,100
Okay, babe.

1734
01:21:07,102 --> 01:21:09,302
So, how's it going with Scout?

1735
01:21:09,304 --> 01:21:10,436
Good.

1736
01:21:10,438 --> 01:21:12,337
But hard. But good.

1737
01:21:12,339 --> 01:21:14,740
A relationship is
a lot of work.

1738
01:21:14,742 --> 01:21:16,379
Don't let anyone
tell you differently.

1739
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:19,479
Hey.
Uh, Lucas, you still want

1740
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:21,715
to play Ascension
with me and the guys later?

1741
01:21:21,717 --> 01:21:24,687
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Classic Lucas.

1742
01:21:25,987 --> 01:21:28,354
Carlos and those SCAB guys
seem cool.

1743
01:21:28,356 --> 01:21:30,457
They're cool.

1744
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:32,995
But they're not
the Bean Bag Boys.

1745
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:37,165
Max.

1746
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,870
All right.

1747
01:21:43,304 --> 01:21:45,971
I guess, I guess I should go.

1748
01:21:45,973 --> 01:21:47,873
Yeah, all right.

1749
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,876
Well...

1750
01:21:49,878 --> 01:21:51,511
Yeah.

1751
01:22:06,827 --> 01:22:09,098
I missed you guys.

1752
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:19,404
Let's make a promise.

1753
01:22:19,406 --> 01:22:21,775
Even if we don't hang out
all the time,

1754
01:22:21,777 --> 01:22:23,943
we'll still always be there
for the big stuff.

1755
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:26,182

Wait.

1759
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:46,900

I have to show you.

1768
01:23:06,588 --> 01:23:09,955
- What do they do with it?
- They swing on it.
