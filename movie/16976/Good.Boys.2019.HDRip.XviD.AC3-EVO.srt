needs more time to think.

161
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:56,543
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

162
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:01,144
Bye.

163
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:05,849
Lasagna and soda?

164
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,853
Don't tell
my parents you gave me this.

165
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:11,622
This kid is hilarious.

166
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,428
We're getting a divorce.

167
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,695
Wh-What do you mean?

168
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,864
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
Everything gonna stay the same.

169
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,165
We promise.

170
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,533
Will we still watch
<i>This Is Us</i> together?

171
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:24,534
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

172
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,536
That's our favorite show.

173
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:26,604
That's our family show.

174
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:27,772
Except now you're gonna see it

175
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:29,572
on two-two different TVs,
you know.

176
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,108
In two different houses.

177
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,777
So you're gonna have to watch
the episode twice.

178
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,811
What about Taco Tuesday?

179
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,479
Taco Tuesdays
are still going down.

180
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,581
Matter of fact, you're gonna
have two Taco Tuesdays,

181
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,450
just one on Wednesday now.

182
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,018
Twice the fun.

183
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,821
Twice the fun, twice the tacos.

184
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:45,523
It's... everything's
gonna stay the same, so...

185
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:47,590
Everything gonna be the same.
Me and your mom, you know,

186
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,026
we're still best friends,
right?

187
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,397
Mm-hmm.

188
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,730
I mean, it would've
been nice to have

189
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:55,532
tacos together as a family,
but how about this?

190
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:56,867
We could change it
to Wing Wednesday...

What's wrong?

210
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,248
That song always makes me sad.

211
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,117
Don't forget, <i>Rock of Ages</i>
auditions are tomorrow.

212
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,853
It's my favorite musical.

213
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,620
I did make some
pretty big changes, though,

214
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,255
based on my time
in Holly-weird.

215
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:53,990
I think it'll really

216
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:56,560
inspire those of you

217
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:57,827
who dare to dream.

218
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:58,863
Sick.

219
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,665
So, I looked at her,
but she was looking

220
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,733
the other direction.

221
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,100
But then she looked at me,

222
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,902
and I was looking
the other direction.

223
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,739
So I think that someday
we're gonna make eye contact.

224
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:09,840
That's cool.

225
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,642
This musical is gonna be lit.

226
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:12,810
Hey, Soren.

227
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,110
Look at this.

228
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:16,616
Sippy Cup is signing up
for the musical.

229
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:21,151
Singing is for try-hards.

230
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:24,821
No, uh, someone signed me up
as a joke.

231
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:27,691
I was just crossing it off.
See?

232
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,192
Yeah, whatever, bitch tits.

233
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:31,762
Enough. Let's go.

234
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:34,665
- I have places to be.
- Sorry, Soren.

235
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,734
Don't listen to Atticus.

236
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,701
His dad doesn't even pay taxes.

237
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,604
Doesn't matter
what Atticus says.

238
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:42,138
I've been thinking about
quitting singing

239
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,806
ever since I was young.

240
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:46,944
Come on.
We're gonna miss fish sticks.

241
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,957
Whoa. That's the best lunch
I've ever seen.

242
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,761
Yeah, my parents are being
super nice because...

243
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:05,963
because...

244
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,697
they're great and...

245
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,002
they're great,
and ev-everything's good.

246
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:15,038
Ooh, wait.
Is that a new earring?

247
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,774
Yes, finally.
Thank you for noticing.

248
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:19,877
- It looks cute on you.
- Max, I'm not going for cute.

249
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,711
I'm going for sexy and hot.

250
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:24,047
Those are the only two things
I'm looking for.

251
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,248
You like it?

252
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,685
It looks infected.

253
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,656
Soren's so cool.

254
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:34,023
I heard he beat up
Derek Bachman

255
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,091
and blow-jobbed his sister.

256
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,261
He blow-jobbed his own sister?

257
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:39,296
No, he blow-jobbed
Derek's sister.

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,535
Fucking legend.

259
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,075

265
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,058
Yeah, I took a pretty big sip,
actually.

Cool.

267
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,028
I'm having a party
tomorrow night.

268

You in?

270
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:17,801
You should come.

271
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,003
Trust me.

272
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,903
Yeah, I'll come,

273
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,275
but, you know,
I'll have to ask my mom.

274
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,777
Also, gonna be a kissing party.

275
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,051
You've French-kissed
girls before, right?

276
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:36,753
Yeah.

277
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,254
Of course.

278
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:39,758
Where?

279
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:45,095
Their mouths?

280
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,797
Yeah, dawg.

281
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,932
He's not gonna start sitting

282
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,036
with the popular kids, is he?

283
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,808
No. If anyone should be
over there, it's me.

284
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,042
We heard kids were
calling you Sippy Cup,

285
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:01,011
and we just wanted to let you
know you can always call on

286
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,180
the Student Coalition Against
Bullying for protection.

287
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,148
Does this look like
a sippy cup?

288
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,984
No, it's a fucking juice box.

289
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:10,387
'Cause I'm not a fucking child.

290
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,888
That's so rude.

291
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,858
Wait. Can I bring
Thor and Lucas?

292
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:19,028
So random.

293
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,730
No, they're cool.

294
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,432
I'm trying to keep it
half girls, half guys.

295
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:23,801
You feel me, dawg?

296
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:25,768
I feel you, dawg, but...

297
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,271
they're my best friends.

298
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:29,709
We do everything together.
We're the Bean Bag Boys.

299
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:32,042
That's a dope-ass name.

300
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:34,845
Fuck it. Bring 'em.

301
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,846
I ride or die
for my squad, too.

302
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,949
Let me know
what your mom says, dawg.

303
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,053
Okay. Bye, dawg.
Bye, dawgs.

304
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:44,988
So?

305
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,989
Soren just invited us
to his party tomorrow.

306
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,859
- Soren?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,128
He said my name?
He said "Thor"?

308
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,763
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Sweet.

309
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,032
Oh, there's also
gonna be girls there.

310
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,399
You know what that means?

311

312

Kissing.

313
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:06,075
So, do you guys know
how to kiss?

314
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:07,945
- I have no fucking clue.
- No.

315
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,816

00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:22,428
I have an idea.

321
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,369
"Are you 18 or older?"

322
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:34,003
I'm gonna click "yes."

323
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,404
We're not 18 or older.

324
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:37,807
This could go on
our permanent record.

325
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:41,277
I'm your stepmother.
You are not supposed to be

326
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,346
- looking at me in the shower.
- Don't tell my dad.

327
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:44,882
He'll make me quit
the sports team.

328
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,783
Get up. Get up.

329
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:48,284
He's in trouble.

330
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,253
You deserve a punishment.

331
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:51,421
Pull down your shorts.

332
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:52,855
Is that what happens

333
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,490
when you get a stepmom?

334
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:57,226
Ew.

335
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:59,329
No way that's gonna fit
in there.

336
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,531
Get out of there, girl!

337
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,199
Where did his hand go?

338
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:03,267
- Ew!
- Oh, my God!

339
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,138
Nobody even kissed.

340
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,242
Yeah, not on their mouths
at least.

341
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,378
My parents have a CPR doll.

342
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,180
We can go practice kissing
on that.

343
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:18,181
Come on.

344
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:27,327
This is
a really pretty CPR doll.

345
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:31,195
I guess I'll go first.

346
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,431
Stop.

347
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,200
What are you doing?

348
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,534
Kissing her.

349
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:40,571
You can't kiss someone
without their permission.

350
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,538
Remember from assembly?

351
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,941
Pretend it's Brixlee.

352
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:46,008
- Try to be a gentleman.
- Okay.

353
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,244
Brixlee, can I kiss you?

354
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,946
Why?

355
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:51,915
- Why?
- Yeah.

356
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,550
What do you like about me?

357
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,319
Well...

358
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,988
you're sweet.
You smell good.

359
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,422
You're smart, too.

360
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,023
You always push Henry
in his wheelchair

361
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,558
even though he's super mean.

362
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,128
And just when I think
I've got you figured out,

363
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,030
you go ahead
and start skateboarding.

364
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,966
I consent.

365
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,509
- How was it?
- Sticky.

366
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,414
Why does she have hair
in her mouth?

367
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,984
You know what? This isn't
teaching us anything.

368
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:28,484
We need to see
real people kissing.

369
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,987
That's the only way to know
if we're doing it right.

370
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:33,223
My neighbor is
a total nymphomaniac.

371
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:35,192
Her boyfriend's always over.

372
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:36,926
She starts fires?

373
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:40,296
No, that's a pyromaniac.
She's a nymphomaniac.

374
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:43,032
Someone who has sex
on land and sea.

375
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,636
Seriously?

376
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:48,071
Okay, I was gonna wait
till tomorrow to surprise you,

377
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:49,438
but can I just tell you?

378
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,341
- Nah, I'm good.
- No, you want to know.

379
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:54,311
Ugh. I can barely see anything.

380
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,013
I know we haven't been
hanging out much,

381
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,347
you know,
ever since I met Benji,

382
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:58,916
but I want to
make it up to you.

383
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,051
So, tomorrow,
I'm skipping school,

384
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,452
and we're driving to the city
to see Kendrick Lamar.

385
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:04,454
- Shut up!
- And we're gonna do Molly.

386
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:06,255
- You thought of everything.
- Of course I fucking have.

387
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,024
It's gonna be amazing.

388
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:09,959
Remix!

389
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:13,930
Well, Benji got us the Molly.

390
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,699
- Benjamin.
- Oh, thank you!

391
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:17,801
Look.

392
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:21,504
This isn't working.
Maybe we could go climb a tree.

393
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,340
No, they'd see us.

394
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:25,108
No, I just meant
let's go climb a tree.

395
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,176
Dude, wait.

396
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:29,378
I know a way
we can see them kiss.

397
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,155
I can't.

398
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,724
It has a camera.
We could see everything.

399
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,993
We can learn technique.

400
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,994
It's for his dad's work.
It's not a toy.

401
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,965
Of course it's a toy.
They sell it at toy stores.

402
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,966
My uncle flew a drone
for the Army,

403
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:52,969
and now he yells in his sleep
and has crazy diarrhea.

404
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:55,205
It's messed up that he even
keeps it in the house.

405
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,374
You have to walk by it
every day.

406
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:58,708
- He's torturing you.
- It's true.

407
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,011
It's like when your cousin
walks around in a bikini

408
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:02,378
and she taunts you.

409
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,113
If he finds out,
you'll be grounded.

410
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,015
You won't be able
to go to Soren's.

411
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,452
And even worse, you'll lose
your father's trust.

412
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,186
It's true, too.

413
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:12,089
She'll love you
for who you are.

414
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,724
Yeah, a shitty kisser.
Remember the porn from earlier?

415
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:16,292
That guy didn't even know
how to kiss.

416
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:17,627
He was just licking
that woman's asshole.

417
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:20,363
- You want to kiss an asshole, Max?
- No.

418
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:22,331
Max, don't listen to him.
He just wants to go

419
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,734
because he's obsessed
with popular boys.

420
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:27,137
Believe me, Max.
You don't want to go to Soren's

421
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:29,539
not knowing how to kiss.

422
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,780
So, tomorrow,
after you get some girl time,

423
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,483
why don't you come over
for some man time?

424
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:41,784
No, I told you I'm hanging out
with Lily this weekend.

425
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,653
Yeah, it's just...
you know, it's hard

426
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:46,455
for me not to see you,
'cause you're my best friend.

427
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:48,792
- But Lily's my best friend.
- Yeah, I get it.

428
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:50,226
Totally, totally get it.

429
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,428
Yeah.

430
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,331
I'll probably just hang out
with my ex, Margaret.

431
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,333
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

432
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,535
Uh, no.
Why? Are you jealous?

433
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,473
Yeah, this isn't working out.

434
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,742
I know. You're not hot enough
to be acting like this,

435
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:07,476
so the next time
that you're wondering

436
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:09,646
where all the nice guys went,
just remember

437
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:12,051
that you let one walk
right out the door.

438
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,552
What?

439
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:18,054
I didn't say anything.

440
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,558
I never want to see you again.

441
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:24,464
Are you okay?

442
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:28,799
Wait, where'd the guy go?

443
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,100
Who cares?
The girls just hugged.

444
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,102
They are definitely gonna kiss.

445
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:34,404
We might need to get closer.

446
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:37,073
Do you hear that?

447
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,408
What is that?

448
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,177
It's fucking spying on us.

449
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,647
- All right, it's my turn to fly.
- Give it!

450
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,251
- I just want to buzz 'em.
- No!

451
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,818
Hey, you're gonna break it.

452
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,253
You want it? Fine!

453
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:51,253
Shit!

454
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:56,859
Ha!

455
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,861
No!

456
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:02,365
- Shit! What the hell, Thor?
- That was both of our faults.

457
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,137
Well, Dad's gonna kill me.
What do I do now?

458
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:07,771
- Whoa!
- What the hell?!

459
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:09,238
- We say there was a break-in.
- What...?

460
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,241
They trashed the place
and took the drone.

461
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:13,642
That's the most stupid
fucking idea I've ever heard!

462
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,311
Guys, guys.

463
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,214
All we have to do
is just go over there

464
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:19,349
and tell the truth,
then God will be on our side.

465
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,224
Hey. Can I help you?

466
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,725
Uh, I hope so, madam.

467
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,462
We were using our drone
to follow a family of turtles,

468
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:34,531
and we thought it might have
crashed in your backyard.

469
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,302
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's here.
Come on in.

470
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,474
- So, you guys like turtles?
- Yeah.

471
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:47,276
- That's awesome.
- Time's up, motherfuckers.

472
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,512
Shit! It's a trap.

473
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:50,546
You think I give a fuck
about turtles?

474
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:52,682
We're sorry. We just wanted
to learn how to kiss.

475
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,251
Lucas, it's none
of their business.

476
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,752
We should have just
told the truth.

477
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:57,521
We're going to a kissing party,

478
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,622
and none of us have
ever kissed, and we're scared.

479
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:01,291
Goddamn it, Lucas.

480
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:04,761
I've had sex before,
but I've never kissed a girl.

481
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:07,429
Just go online and type in
"how to kiss."

482
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:08,732
That's what everyone does.

483
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:11,201
Oh.

484
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:12,903
It's very easy.

485
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,704
Look, can we please
have the drone back?

486
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,372
It's a BD Rolling Thunder.
It's my dad's.

487
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:18,507
He needs it for work.
Can I please have it back?

488
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,443
- I really need it. Please.
- I don't think so.

489
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:23,446
If you don't give it back,
I'll tell my dad you stole it.

490
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:25,447
And I'll tell him
that you're a pervert.

491
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:26,483
We'll tell the whole school.

492
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:28,484
This is sensual harassment.

493
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,520
We'll tell everyone
that you're a misogynist.

494
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:33,490
I never massaged anyone.

495
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:36,525
This is what happens
when you don't respect women.

496
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:38,962
I respect women.
My mom's my best friend.

497
00:22:38,964 --> 00:22:40,830
What about me?

498
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:43,500
Oh, God, I'm so fucked.

499
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,368
My dad's gonna kill me.

500
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,237
You had to snoop on them.
You're such a feminist.

501
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm-I'm not a feminist.
I love women.

502
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:53,243
And my parents are definitely
gonna call your guys' parents.

503
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:54,644
We're all gonna get grounded.

504
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:56,446
Forget Soren's party.
We're fucked.

505
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:59,416
Why are you smiling?
This is actually your fault.

506
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:01,786
This is leverage.

507
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,523
Oh.

508
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,326
Bingo.

509
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:11,594
- What is it?
- I have no idea.

510
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:12,928
That's a tampon.

511
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,965
- What's it for?
- Girls shove it

512
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,933
up their buttholes
to stop babies from coming out.

513
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:18,601
An eighth-grader told me that.

514
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:21,606
The human body
is truly a mystery.

515
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,742
Can't believe
they still eat chewables.

516
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:26,542
The gummies are so much better.

517
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,878
I like the chewables.
I want one.

518
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,260
Fucking childproof bullshit!

519
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:45,861
Thor! Thor!
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

520
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:55,437
It's the girls.

521
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:58,274
Hello?

522
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:01,378
You took my bag.
It has my license, my phone.

523
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,745
Bring it back right now.

524
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,880
Fuck that noise.
I want my drone back.

525
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:07,384
I got this.
I got this, I got this.

526
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:09,452
What did you
just say, you little bitch?

527
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:12,355
I'll take a shit
down your throat.

528
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:14,523
Why are you talking like that?

529
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,025
Hannah, I have
a little brother.

530
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:18,895
- You're supposed to scare them.
- Well, you scared me.

531
00:24:18,897 --> 00:24:21,497
Listen, we-we were just trying
to teach you a lesson.

532
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:24,067
I promise you we were gonna
give the drone back.

533
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,035
No way.
They could trick us again.

534
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:27,904
Or overpower us.

535
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:30,740
Oh, my God.
What if they take the Molly?

536
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:33,342
Then we wouldn't be able
to take it.

537
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:34,644
No, they're children.
They would die.

538
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,580
This is Max from earlier.

539
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:41,051
Meet us at the playground
across from John Adams

540
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:43,552
tomorrow at 7:40 a.m.

541
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:46,926
Bring the drone, and don't
fuck with the Bean Bag Boys.

542
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:50,560
- That was tough.
- Very tough.

543
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:52,428
I kind of got a boner
talking to those girls.

544
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,629
We're still on the phone.

545
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,898
- Shit! Fuck, fuck.
- What the shit?!

546
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,105
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

547
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:05,611
11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

548
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:19,557
Ow.

549
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,464
Don't come any closer.

550
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:30,132
- Why?
- 'Cause you could overpower us.

551
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:32,135
So, put the drone

552
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:34,704
on the slide, and count back
from a hundred,

553
00:25:34,706 --> 00:25:36,473
and close your eyes.

554
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:38,073
And don't try anything funny.

555
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,708
There are witnesses.

556
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,111
Okay, we have a long drive
ahead of us,

557
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,580
so give us the bag
or I will hurt you.

558
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:45,715
Do not test me.

559
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:47,817
Threats will get you nowhere,
peasant.

560
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,386
Just give us the fucking Molly!

561
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:52,955
Okay. Who's Molly?
'Cause she's not with us.

562
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:54,690
Guys.

563
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:58,727
Molly is a sex drug.
<i>Dateline</i> did an exposé on it.

564
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:02,599
You had us bring drugs
to a fucking playground?!

565
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:04,634
There are children here!

566
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:06,735
- Shit.
- It's okay.

567
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:08,036
I know what to do.

568
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:10,106
We're making
a citizen's arrest!

569
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:11,640
You're both under arrest!

570
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,942
- Get on the ground!
- Sweet Jesus.

571
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:14,444
- Up, up, up!
- Stay still!

572
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:16,178
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Stay still!

573
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,549
Get down now!
Get down now!

574
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,117
Did you just reload
your fake gun?

575
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,619
- Are you mocking me?
- Put your hands up!

576
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:23,786
Are you mocking me?!

577
00:26:23,788 --> 00:26:25,487
Anything will be used
against you

578
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:27,490
- that you say.
- In court.

579
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:28,957
You know, you're the one
holding drugs,

580
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,427
so why don't I do
a citizen's arrest on you?

581
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:32,861
Fuck.

582
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:34,664
Time-out, crackheads.

583
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,198
Oh, my God.

584
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,869
Deal's off. We can't let them
put drugs back on the street.

585
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:41,771
Look at those dirty
fucking junkies.

586
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,572
Their lives are already ruined.

587
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:45,742
Let's just give them the drugs
and get the drone.

588
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:48,878
Maybe there's a way we can

589
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,548
protect our community
and get the drone back.

590
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,515
Stall them.

591
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:57,520
So, what do you plan to do
with those drugs, huh?

592
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,555
Take 'em and feel amazing.

593
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:01,757
They're addicts.

594
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,091
Yeah.

595
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,895
So, you been drugging
your whole life?

596
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:07,930
- Uh-huh.
- E'r'day.

597
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:09,131
Oh. Nice.

598
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,766
What's he doing? Hey.

599
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:15,038
- Yes! Yes!
- It's working!

600
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,005
- It's working!
- Yes!

601
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:18,608
Fly it to the school!

602
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,176
You're heading for the trees! Watch out!

603
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,880
We're gonna make it!
We're gonna make it!

604
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:27,720
Fuck!

605
00:27:32,923 --> 00:27:34,957
Those girls are lucky
I didn't kick their asses.

606
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:37,593
Oh, no! They found us!

607
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:40,096
- Oh, shit.
- They're on school property.

608
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:42,168
They don't care.
They're tweaking.

609
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:46,569
You know who we need?

610
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:47,870
- No, don't say it.
- We'll look like losers.

611
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:49,872
- Don't say it. Don't say it.
- SCAB!

612
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:51,107
- Shut up.
- SCAB!

613
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,809
- Shut up. Zip it.
- Lucas, shut up.

614
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,610
- SCAB!
- What is that?

615
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:56,044
There's three boys in danger!

616
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:58,881
We're scared!
SCAB, help us!

617
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:00,884
We're okay.

618
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:02,551
- We're not scared. We're... we're fine.
- Lucas, shut up.

619
00:28:02,553 --> 00:28:04,153
Just walking into school.

620
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:05,053
- Average day.
- Jesus Christ.

621
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:06,222
Bullying is wack.

622
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,558
Get on the right track.

623
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,092
Bullying is wack.

624
00:28:10,094 --> 00:28:12,829
Get on the right track.

625
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:15,865
Bullying is wack.

626
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,734
Get on the right track.

627
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:21,140
Bullying is wack.

628
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:28,878
When you attack one of us,

629
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,612
you attack all of us.

630
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,215
Your weakness
gives us strength.

631
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:34,984
- Well, those kids stole my bag.
- Not today, bully!

632
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:37,719
Not today.

633
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:39,187
- What the fuck?
- Bullying is wack.

634
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,590
Get on the right track.

635
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:43,158
This is the best day
of my life.

636
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,593
Get on the right track.

637
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:46,931
Don't worry,
we'll find them later.

638
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,834
SCAB just tagged us
on Instagram.

639
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:55,204
First Sippy Cup, and now this?

640
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:58,006
I'm two weeks into sixth grade,
I'm already a social piranha.

641
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:00,275
Guys, my dad gets back at 5:00.

642
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:02,779
If we don't get a new drone
by then, I'm grounded.

643
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:05,013
Which means we're all grounded,
which means no party,

644
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:06,715
which means no Brixlee.

645
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:09,118
- Sippy Cup for life.
- No Brixlee,

646
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,286
no friends, no hope,

647
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:14,624
parents fighting,
trapped in our rooms,

648
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:17,859
all alone, two Taco Tuesdays.

649
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:21,166
So, Max, what are we gonna do?

650
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:25,834
We're gonna ditch school
and get a new drone.

651
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:27,971
Stop thinking with
your big old dick, Max.

652
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:29,973
That could go on
our permanent record.

653
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,942
Max's big old dick is pointing
us in the right direction.

654
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:35,978
Thank you. If anyone else
kisses Brixlee, I'll die.

655
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,914
Wait, what?
Here's the plan.

656
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,014
I'm gonna bring a beer
to Soren's,

657
00:29:39,016 --> 00:29:41,016
and I'm gonna sip that beer
so everyone will know...

658
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:43,653
That you're an alcoholic.

659
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:44,887
- That would be great.
- Guys.

660
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:46,656
The only place around here
that has one

661
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:47,790
is at North Point Galleria.

662
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,224
That's four miles away.

663
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:53,161
Four miles? How the fuck
are we getting four miles?

664
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,830
- You have Uber.
- No, it goes directly

665
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:56,799
to my mom's phone.
She'll know.

666
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:58,400
Then we bike.

667
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:01,272
Where are you even gonna get
the money for a new drone?

668
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,308
- What?
- You know.

669
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,677
Our Turzan of Uzkara card?
No way!

670
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,048
You said everyone wants
to buy it.

671
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,916
- We got it together.
- And we're gonna

672
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:15,685
sell it together, as friends.

673
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:16,918
Come on, Lucas.

674
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,289
Bean Bag Boys
do everything together.

675
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:21,724
Okay.

676
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,426
Guess that makes sense.

677
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:24,293
- Yes!
- Yes!

678
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:27,362
- Lucas! Bean Bag Boys for life.
- Yeah!

679
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,233
We're being so bad.

680
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,069
♪ We're bad, we're so bad ♪

681
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:35,303
♪ We're bad,
we're so bad ♪

682
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,742
♪ We're bad, we're so bad. ♪

683
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,823
I need to get rid
of these drugs.

684
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:57,326
- What are you doing?!
- Getting rid of the drugs!

685
00:30:57,328 --> 00:31:00,096
I'm just gonna throw them
in the stream.

686
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:01,930
It can contaminate the water.

687
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:03,366
Well, then we can throw it
in the forest.

688
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:04,501
It's a sex drug.

689
00:31:04,503 --> 00:31:07,203
What if a fox eats it
and tries to fuck a squirrel?

690
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:08,705
It'll kill him.

691
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:10,305
Well, then how do we
get rid of drugs?

692
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:12,407
The same way
we get rid of a baby.

693
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:13,709
- Abortion?
- Adoption?

694
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:14,910
No.

695
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,413
We drop it off at the firehouse
on our way up to the mall.

696
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,148
That's a really good idea.

697
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,984
Ah. I just got a bite
on our card.

698
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,721
Nice. Give 'em my address.

699
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,822
My parents aren't home,
and I have the best snacks.

700
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:29,358
PeterPan69 is gonna be here

701
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,293
in five minutes
to buy the card.

702
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:32,762
Well, let's get ready.

703
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:34,097
I found all of these weapons

704
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,868
in the back
of my parents' closet.

705
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:42,237
I still don't get
why we need weapons.

706
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,773
He could be a pedophile.

707
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:45,041
He can't molest
all three of us.

708
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,045
All he needs is one.

709
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:53,182
"An-al beads"?

710
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,984
Aka nunchucks, motherfucker.

711
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:57,219
Ooh.

712
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,856
- Yeah!
- It's not a toy.

713
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:03,826
Oh, shoot.

714
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:06,061
They smell like shit.

715
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:16,539
Hello.
Uh, I'm looking for Lucas.

716
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:19,175
- That's me.
- I'm Claude.

717
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:20,243
Hey.

718
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:22,811
That's my mom back there.

719
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,382
Hi-ya!

720
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,984
Let's cut the shit.
Are you a pedophile?

721
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:29,417
What? No.

722
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:31,020
Lucas, if you were a pedophile

723
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,554
standing in front
of three single boys,

724
00:32:32,556 --> 00:32:35,057
- would you admit it?
- Probably not.

725
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,292
Then why would he?

726
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:37,859
Oh, come on.

727
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:39,494
Do I look like a pedophile?

728
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:40,897
- Sure do.
- Yes, absolutely. - 1,000%.

729
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:42,497
That's not fair.

730
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:45,301
You look more like a pedophile
than anyone I've ever seen.

731
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:48,937
Look, I'm not a pedophile.
I'm a cool guy.

732
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:52,274
Fine. You can come in,
but please take your shoes off.

733
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:54,377
You know, I've searched
the world for this.

734
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:56,411
Why are you bringing
the paintball gun?

735
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:58,848
In case anyone fucks with us.

736
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,949
This card is exquisite.

737
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:03,151
- How'd you get it?
- The summer I moved here,

738
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:06,254
me, Max and Thor started
a dog-washing business.

739
00:33:06,256 --> 00:33:08,357
We earned eight bucks,
and we used the money

740
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,926
to buy an Ascension pack,
and this card was in it.

741
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,461
Well, you got very lucky.

742
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:14,563
The real luck
was meeting Max and Thor.

743
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:15,997
Fascinating.

744
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,265
We started calling ourself
the Bean Bag Boys.

745
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:20,369
- You know why?
- Because you had some beanbags?

746
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:22,972
- That's right.
- Yeah. Genius.

747
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:24,307
You got yourself a deal.

748
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:29,212
Let's go.
Let's make it happen.

749
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:34,349
No, I can't do this.

750
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:35,551
Sorry.

751
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:37,853
Lucas, get your butt
over here right now.

752
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:40,488
Excuse me, is this how all
12-year-olds conduct business?

753
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,858
What the hell just happened?

754
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,391
I thought you were cool
with this.

755
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:46,161
You said we wouldn't do this
if one of us wasn't on board.

756
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:48,496
- I'm not on board.
- Why do you care so much?

757
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:49,965
Why don't you care?

758
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,500
This card has
a lot of memories,

759
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:53,269
and you're just gonna
throw it all away

760
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,170
because you want to kiss
some basic girl?

761
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:56,472
Savage.

762
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,006
Brixlee isn't just some girl.

763
00:33:58,008 --> 00:33:59,609
We're probably
gonna get married.

764
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:02,177
Every marriage ends in divorce.

765
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:05,080
Lucas, you're outvoted.

766
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:07,215
Listen, I can tell
you're lashing out with anger,

767
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:09,151
but Brixlee is probably
the love of my life.

768
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:12,988
Excuse me, ma'am. Can I get
a glass of water, please?

769
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,293
Hello?

770
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:20,329
Hey, guys?

771
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:22,497
Hmm.

772
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:24,300
Yeah.

773
00:34:24,302 --> 00:34:26,167
What can you tell me
about her backstory?

774
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,303
Where is she supposed
to be from?

775
00:34:27,305 --> 00:34:28,336
She seems quite exotic.

776
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:30,939
Okay, listen carefully,

777
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:32,675
'cause I'll make this offer
only once.

778
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:35,044
400 bucks to take her
off your hands.

779
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:38,113
No. We need 550, U.S.

780
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,682
Fuck off. What?

781
00:34:39,684 --> 00:34:41,684
That's my entire allowance.

782
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:44,287
Listen, Claude,
let's just cut the bullshit.

783
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:47,455
I'm the son of a businesswoman,
and I think we both know,

784
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:49,457
if you didn't want
to buy the doll,

785
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:51,193
you would've left already.

786
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:54,129
Stop treating us like kids.
We know how things work.

787
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:57,600
So, do you want to buy
the CPR doll or not?

788
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:04,439
Fools.
I'd have paid a thousand.

789
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:07,209
Anyone else feel like
he's gonna fuck that doll?

- Lucas, are you okay?

835
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:12,834
- What the hell happened?
- We were running away

836
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:14,403
from our babysitter
'cause she was trying

837
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:16,171
- to touch our penises.
- What? That is not true.

838
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,506
- Yes, it is. - Yes, it is.
- I wasn't.

839
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:19,111
- Yeah, you were.
- I wasn't...

840
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,079
- Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go!
- What happened?

841
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,312
Go, go!

842
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:26,715
Lucas, are you okay?

843
00:37:26,717 --> 00:37:29,318
I-I think I'm fine.

844
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,820
- - Your arm.
- Oh, hell no.

845
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,591
Yo, I'm-a call 911.

846
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:37,792
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no. It's okay.

847
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:38,727
This happens all the time.

848
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,229
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go. Go.

849
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:42,097
- Help! Ow!
- We got... Come on.

850
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:44,200
I'll get the bikes.

851
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,137
Okay. I threw their phone
in a prickle bush.

852
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,704
So they can't track us anymore.

853
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:51,307
Oh, the pain!

854
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:52,608
Lucas, you have to be quiet.

855
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,176
Okay, do we have any ice?

856
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:56,412
No, we're in a fucking alley.

857
00:37:56,414 --> 00:37:58,780
What about pain medication?

858
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:01,216
- We have the Molly we can give him.
- No!

859
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:02,785
Yeah, he's probably just gonna
try and have sex with us.

860
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:04,120
Call an ambulance!

861
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,421
- Mission's over!
- We'll get busted.

862
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:08,858
- Plus, do you even have insurance?
- I don't know.

863
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,593
- Do you?
- I don't know.

864
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:12,595
- I think I only have a deductible.
- It's all right.

865
00:38:12,597 --> 00:38:14,597
This happens to MMA fighters
all the time.

866
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,798
We just got to ram your arm
into something very hard

867
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,503
so it pops back in place.

868
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:23,539
Fine! Fuck it!
Let's just get this over with.

869
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,673
Ow!

870
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:27,475
- Come on.
- Easy. All right.

871
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,845
One, two, three.

872
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:39,220
Wrong arm!

873
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:41,222
- Okay, new site, new site.
- Okay.

874
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:43,559
Okay, lie down on your back
and give me your arm.

875
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:45,660
Come on.

876
00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:48,564
All right. It says
this next part's gonna hurt,

877
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:50,733
that you should bite down
on something hard.

878
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:52,336
I know.

879
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,606
Open. There you go.

880
00:38:57,608 --> 00:38:59,408
Okay.

881
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,410
- On three.
- One,

882
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,312
two, three.

883
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:04,479
- Just got a text from Taylor.
- What'd she say?

884
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,582
She wants to know
why you aren't in school

885
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:08,350
and if you're coming
to the party tonight.

886
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:09,651
Just write...

887
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:10,818
Okay, sorry.
One, two, three!

888
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,490
Oh!

889
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:15,557
Let me help, let me help.

890
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,791
- Focus! On three.
- One!

891
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:18,727
Two! Three!

892
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:24,200
Hmm?

893
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:28,607
Wow. I didn't think that'd actually work.

894
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:32,975
You're gonna be good, man.

895
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:35,577
No.

896
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,345
I'm really not.

897
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:40,317
My parents are getting
a divorce.

898
00:39:42,352 --> 00:39:43,686
What'd you do?

899
00:39:43,688 --> 00:39:45,820
- Thor!
- What?

900
00:39:45,822 --> 00:39:47,789
Sorry.

901
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:53,365
My dad's moving out.

902
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:57,733

between your parents,

903
00:39:57,735 --> 00:39:59,905
you always got
the Bean Bag Boys.

904
00:40:01,872 --> 00:40:04,472

Bean Bag Boys for life.

905
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,441
You promise?

906
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:07,475
- Promise.
- Promise.

907
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:09,544
Come on.

908
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,713
Let's get you some
Children's Tylenol.

909
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:23,492
- Want some help, buddy?
- No, I got it.

910
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:25,727
Okay, just do it.

911
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:33,936
- Hey, Miles.
- Hey, man.

912
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:35,738
- Coming in or coming off?
- Just got off a triple.

913
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,740
Man, I don't care
if I get mugged.

914
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:39,910
I'm not typing up
any more paperwork today.

915
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:42,247
Cop.

916
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:47,483
Shit.
We have D-R-U-G-S on us.

917
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,684
He knows how to spell.
Just act normal.

918
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:52,287
- Pretend to talk.
- About what?

919
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:53,955
Just be normal.

920
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:56,892
What do you think
about politics?

921
00:40:56,894 --> 00:40:58,763
It's a complicated issue.

922
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:01,796
This cop's acting weird.

923
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:03,666
He's eye-fucking us.

924
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:05,033
Just act normal.
Just laugh.

925
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,901
We're just
two cool guys laughing.

926
00:41:12,677 --> 00:41:14,309
We skipped school.

927
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:15,477
Lucas!

928
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:18,347
Are we in trouble?

929
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:20,948
Yeah, well, usually,
I'd call this in,

930
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,352
but because you were
honest with me,

931
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:24,753
I'm gonna let you slide,
all right?

932
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,655
Just promise
not to do it again, okay?

933
00:41:26,657 --> 00:41:28,457
We promise.
Thank you, sir.

934
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:29,291
All right.

935
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:31,026
That was a close one.

936
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:32,995

Schedule I
controlled substance,

with intent to distribute.

954
00:42:18,142 --> 00:42:19,975
Brother,
these are vitamins, okay?

955
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:21,709
Children's vitamins, at that.

956
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:23,379
- No, those are drugs.
- No, look.

957
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:25,513
If that's drugs,
then this is drugs, too.

958
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:27,582
- If you don't arrest us, I'll report you.
- Lucas!

959
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:29,417
Just leave me the fuck alone!

960
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:31,086
I mean, sorry to fucking swear
at kids, but fuck.

961
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:33,122
You know, I'm gonna arrest you
for fucking ruining my day.

962
00:42:33,124 --> 00:42:35,894
All right? I'll take them.
Let me go home!

963
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,997
- He's calling for backup.
- What do we do?

964
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:45,434
Hello. Listen.
I've decided I don't want kids.

965
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:47,669
- What's up?
- The cop's eye-fucking us.

966
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:50,539
We have to make a run for it.
I know what to do.

967
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:52,173
Well, no, it's not
up for discu...

968
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:53,941
Well, yeah, well, no, you may be detective,

969
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:55,010
but in the marriage
we're equal.

970
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:56,412
Wha...?

971
00:42:56,414 --> 00:42:57,716
Just hang up.
Who cares?

972
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:01,716
This is free 'cause I'm a cop.

You didn't even care
about my shoulder.

980
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:25,640
- You just wanted a beer.
- I can care about two things.

983
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,080
I just ran off
without my family's bikes.

984
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:36,084
- Cycle Sundays are fucked!
- Guys, guys.

985
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:37,553
The mall!

- Yes!

Great.

992
00:43:55,206 --> 00:43:58,106
Now we're trapped between
a highway and the authorities.

993
00:43:58,108 --> 00:43:59,908
Well, we wouldn't be
in this position right now

994
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,075
if you weren't such a narc.

995
00:44:01,077 --> 00:44:03,678
Guys, the mall's right there.

996
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,513
All we have to do
is cross the highway,

997
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:07,015
and the cars
aren't even moving.

998
00:44:07,017 --> 00:44:11,119

or are we sixth-graders?

1003

I don't give a fuck.

1004
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,075
Uh, no, you won't.

1005
00:44:33,077 --> 00:44:34,510

- Hey.

1009
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:42,651
You guys aren't the ones
who's gonna have

00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:51,926
Children crossing.

1014
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:53,662
- Please, children are crossing.
- Get off the road.

1015
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:58,166
- What are you guys doing? Get back to the side.
- Go!

1016
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:00,068
- Go, go, go, go. - Now.
- Fucking idiots!

1017
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,604
Wait. I got a message.

1018
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:04,939
Oh, it's from Taylor.

1019
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:06,675
She said Marcus is
coming to the party.

1020
00:45:06,677 --> 00:45:08,042
He has a huge crush on Brixlee.

1021
00:45:08,044 --> 00:45:10,044
She's definitely
gonna kiss him.

1022
00:45:10,046 --> 00:45:12,580
- He's the nicest kid in our grade.
- Wait, wait.

1023
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:13,981
I'm the nicest kid
in our grade.

1024
00:45:13,983 --> 00:45:18,086
It goes me, Marcus, Max, you.

1025
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:20,856
- I'm way nicer than Max.
- No, you're not!

1026
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:22,925
You made Ms. Willoughby cry
last year.

1027
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:25,026
Hey, she was already crying.
I just took her picture.

1028
00:45:25,028 --> 00:45:26,928
Guys, guys! Look!

1029
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,265
- It started.
- Oh, shit.

1030
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,800
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck.

1031
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:33,200
- Let's go back!
- Let's go back!

1032
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:35,803
We're trapped.

1033
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:37,842
Let us out!

1034
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:42,811
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

1035
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:45,079
- No, we're not. We just need to time it, okay?
- Oh, fuck!

1036
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:46,247
- We just need to time it right.
- Shit!

1037
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:48,986
We can do this, guys.
We can do this!

1038
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:52,620
N-No!

1039
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,091
- Max, no!
- Are you batshit crazy?!

1040
00:45:56,093 --> 00:45:58,327
What the fuck are you doing?!

1041
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:03,097
- Oh, shit. He made it.
- Oh!

1042
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:04,600
I did it!

1043
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:06,867
Lucas, Lucas,
look at me right now.

1044
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,070
I know you're scared.

1045
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:09,370
I'm not, at all...

1046
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:10,838
Shut up, Thor!

1047
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:15,276
- Lucas, fuck you! No!
- Shit! Shit!

1048
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:16,278
Lucas!

1049
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:21,048
No! Lucas!

1050
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,218
I'm not dead!

1051
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,620
- I'm not dead!
- All right.

1052
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:27,356
- You got it, man. Come on.
- Yes! Yes!

1053
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:29,624
- Fuck you!
- I love you, too.

1054
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:30,959
Now, come over here.

1055
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:32,126
I want my mom.

1056
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:33,695
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

1057
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:35,696
I'm fine.
I'll just live here.

1058
00:46:35,698 --> 00:46:37,064
- I-I'm good.
- Come on!

1059
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:39,166
- Come on!
- You got this!

1060
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:41,003
All right. Come on, Thor.

1061
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:43,771
You are not Sippy Cup.
You're a badass.

1062
00:46:43,773 --> 00:46:46,073
Come on, come on!

1063
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:48,343
Oh, shit! My beer!

1064
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,023
Oh, shit!

1065
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,129
- Oh!
- Oh, wait.

1066
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,097
That's my dad's CPR doll.

1067
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,867
- Oh.
- That's my dad's CPR doll!

1068
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:13,669
- We're not murderers!
- Yes!

1069
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:15,236
- We're saved!
- We're not fucking killers!

1070
00:47:15,238 --> 00:47:17,204
- We're not killers!
- Yes!

1071
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:27,048
Beep, beep.

1072
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,316
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

1073
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:29,950
- Pardon me. Sorry.
- Hey!

1074
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:31,221
Excuse me.
Got to get through.

1075
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:33,358
Sorry.

1076
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:39,193
Hey. We called about
the BD Rolling Thunder.

1077
00:47:39,195 --> 00:47:41,296
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1078
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:43,131
Sold it.

1079
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,700
Ha-ha. Nice joke.

1080
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:46,367
So funny.

1081
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,403
No, I did. I sold it.
Two girls, said they knew you.

1082
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:51,305
Fuck you!

1083
00:47:51,307 --> 00:47:53,475
- Jesus.
- I'm gonna kill your family, and then they're

1084
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:55,276
- gonna come alive...
- Ease off the sugar, huh?

1085
00:47:55,278 --> 00:47:57,278
- ...and turn your whole family into zombies!
- Max!

1086
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,383
I was gonna say...
you didn't let me finish...

1087
00:48:01,385 --> 00:48:03,251
they left a note for you.

1088
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,492
Why are they walking like that?

1089
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:13,061
I don't know.

1090
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:18,200
How'd you guys track us?

1091
00:48:18,202 --> 00:48:19,767
We threw your bag
in prickle bushes.

1092
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,870
Dumbass, you told us
that your life would be over

1093
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:23,771
if you didn't get
a BD Rolling Thunder,

1094
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:25,173
and this is the only place

1095
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:27,408
- a child could get to on a tricycle.
- Okay.

1096
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,380
I have the drugs.
Now give me the drone.

1097
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:35,086
Are you fucking kidding me?

1098
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:40,155
What in the actual fuck?
These are just gummy vitamins.

1099
00:48:40,157 --> 00:48:41,356
- Shit.
- Told you she was gonna check.

1100
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:42,791
- Fuck.
- Where is the Molly?

1101
00:48:42,793 --> 00:48:45,160
- Where is it?
- A cop has it.

1102
00:48:45,162 --> 00:48:47,329
You gave our drugs to a cop?

1103
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:48,763
Wait. Look.

1104
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:50,097
I know you don't know us

1105
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,767
and you think
we're just stupid kids,

1106
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:52,834
but just listen to me.

1107
00:48:52,836 --> 00:48:54,269
Whatever problems
you're having,

1108
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,937
drugs are not the answer.

1109
00:48:55,939 --> 00:48:58,939
Drugs just give you
a false sense of reality.

1110
00:48:58,941 --> 00:49:00,941
You may think
your lives are bad,

1111
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:03,879
but you have family
and friends who love you.

1112
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:05,213
Can you shut the fuck up?

1113
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:07,082
I just spent $600
on a fucking drone.

1114
00:49:07,084 --> 00:49:08,816
You ruined
my passionate moment.

1115
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:11,820
- Well, it was stupid.
- This day is fucked.

1116
00:49:11,822 --> 00:49:13,088
Benji is the only one
who has Molly,

1117
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,256
and he won't sell it to us.

1118
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:16,091
Okay. Well, I'm sorry.

1119
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:17,825
We're fucked.

1120
00:49:17,827 --> 00:49:20,163
We'll do it.
We'll get your drugs.

1121
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:23,865
- The fuck we will.
- What the hell, dude?

1122
00:49:23,867 --> 00:49:25,533
Do you think
he would sell to kids?

1123
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:27,169
We're not kids.

1124
00:49:27,171 --> 00:49:28,370
We're tweens.

1125
00:49:28,372 --> 00:49:30,508
What do we have to lose?

1126
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:34,811
So, it's a deal?

1127
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:38,012
Max, this is fucking insane.

1128
00:49:38,014 --> 00:49:39,548
Just take
your goddamn punishment.

1129
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,515
Lucas and I
will go to the party.

1130
00:49:41,517 --> 00:49:43,852
We'll cock-block anyone
that gets near Brixlee.

1131
00:49:43,854 --> 00:49:46,555
They didn't invite you.

1132
00:49:46,557 --> 00:49:48,289
What?

1133
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,392
The popular kids
only invited me.

1134
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:53,128
What do you mean?

1135
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,997
They think you're kind of...
random.

1136
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:58,133
- Oh.
- But it's okay,

1137
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:00,267
'cause once those guys
get to know you,

1138
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,470
they'll see what I see,
that you're not random.

1139
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:04,004
That you're specific.

1140
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:05,407
I'm not buying drugs.

1141
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,475
- Neither am I.
- You guys don't have to.

1142
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,443
I'll do all the talking. I just
need your height in there.

1143
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:11,412
You're the only one of us

1144
00:50:11,414 --> 00:50:13,481
that looks like
they could be in college.

1145
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:16,084
Guys.

1146
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:18,089
Are you in or out?

1147
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:22,256
So, you guys did all of this
for a kissing party?

1148
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:25,026
No. There's also gonna be
cool boys there.

1149
00:50:25,028 --> 00:50:26,861
I remember my first
kissing party.

1150
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:28,396
It was the summer
after sixth grade

1151
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:29,965
at Manush Patel's house.

1152
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:31,166
Who'd you kiss?

1153
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:33,300
Uh, Manush's sister.

1154
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:34,903
Wait, you weren't there?

1155
00:50:34,905 --> 00:50:36,403
No, we didn't really
know each other then.

1156
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:38,240
I mean, we were in
the same grade,

1157
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:40,242
but we didn't really become
close until eighth grade.

1158
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,376
Oh. I just figured you guys

1159
00:50:42,378 --> 00:50:44,479
- knew each other for longer.
- Yeah, everybody knows

1160
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,548
you meet your best friends
in kindergarten.

1161
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,115
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the only reason

1162
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:49,416
you're friends with people
back then

1163
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:51,051
is 'cause you live close
to each other.

1164
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:52,254
Or, because, like,
your parents are friends.

1165
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:54,122
No. That's not true for us.

1166
00:50:54,124 --> 00:50:56,124
We're friends
because we like each other.

1167
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:59,494
- And we live close together.
- And our parents are friends.

1168
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,138
Okay, come here.

1169
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,908
Go in. Buy two pills.

1170
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,343
Ask for Benji.

1171
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:16,945
Do not mention Hannah.

1172
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:19,247
- Who's Hannah?
- I am.

1173
00:51:19,249 --> 00:51:21,548
Oh. I'm Max.

1174
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,050
Yeah, I know who you are.

1175
00:51:23,052 --> 00:51:25,287
Okay, just go in there,
buy the pills,

1176
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,191
and then I'll trade you
for the drone.

1177
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:32,327
Okay, if this goes bad,
drive off.

1178
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:33,928
- Okay.
- Okay.

1179
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,696
It's not too late to turn back.

1180
00:51:35,698 --> 00:51:37,698
No. We have to get the drugs

1181
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,035
so we can get the drone,
so we can go to the party.

1182
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:05,930
Hello?

1183
00:52:13,736 --> 00:52:15,637
I am your daddy!

1184
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,638
You are my baby!

1185
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,108
Listen, you will stay
down here and suffer

1186
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,242
until you learn to be men!

1187
00:52:24,581 --> 00:52:27,414
Listen!
What you babies wearing?

1188
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:29,651
- Diapers!
- That's right!

1189
00:52:31,454 --> 00:52:34,622
Good evening.
We're looking for Benji.

1190
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:39,260
Hey, dickless. Come here.

1191
00:52:39,262 --> 00:52:42,129
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right, I need you to go find Benji.

1192
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:43,597
Tell him he's got visitors.

1193
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,265
Yes, Daddy.

1194
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:47,234
I ask the fucking questions!

1195
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:48,769
That's your son?

1196
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:52,240
You guys can go sit your
asses down over there and wait.

1197
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:55,075
Whatever happens to you is

1198
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:56,378
your own fucking fault.

1199
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,713
Drop and give me 20,
you fucking babies!

1200
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,251
Listen!

1201
00:53:03,253 --> 00:53:06,021
Four! Get up!

1202
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,024
Can I help you?

1203
00:53:09,026 --> 00:53:10,358
Good afternoon.

1204
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,997
We would like to buy
two pieces of Molly, please.

1205
00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:20,068
Did Rafi from Sigma Nu
send you?

1206
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,301
He did, that fucker.

1207
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:23,271
You guys are, like, seven.

1208
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:25,173
Oh, except for you.
I recognize you from econ.

1209
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:26,276
What's up, man?

1210
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,378
Seriously,
I'm not selling drugs to kids.

1211
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,148
We're not kids.
We're tweens.

1212
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:35,749
Who told you to come here?

1213
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:38,621
Sell us the drugs,
and you'll find out.

1214
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:44,595
All right.

1215
00:53:45,628 --> 00:53:47,428
Stay there.

1216
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:54,803
Hey.

1217
00:53:54,805 --> 00:53:57,508
How long do you think
he's gonna be?

1218
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:04,546
Oh, you made me high.

1219
00:54:13,356 --> 00:54:15,256
Ah.

1220
00:54:15,258 --> 00:54:17,528
Tell me who sent you.

1221
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:21,729
Hannah.

1222
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:23,530
What? I'm high as fuck.

1223
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:27,869
So, this is what
she thinks of me, huh?

1224
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:31,840
You can tell Hannah
that if she wants Molly,

1225
00:54:31,842 --> 00:54:33,575
she can suck my dick.

1226
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:36,144
You shouldn't talk about
women like that.

1227
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:38,245
The only time
she should suck your dick

1228
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:40,150
is when she gives you consent.

1229
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:43,283
You can suck my dick,

1230
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:45,285
and you can suck
my dick, too.

1231
00:54:45,287 --> 00:54:47,624
What about me?
I'm just gonna sit here?

1232
00:54:49,726 --> 00:54:52,227
We're the Bean Bag Boys.
We do everything together.

1233
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:54,495
Get the fuck out of here,
you little fucking babies.

1234
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:55,499
Let's go.

1235
00:54:56,566 --> 00:54:58,566
Get out!

1236
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,704
Hey, guys, wait.

1237
00:55:02,706 --> 00:55:04,372
I have something in here

1238
00:55:04,374 --> 00:55:06,707
that might change your mind.

1239
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:08,475
Hurry up.

1240
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:10,211
Pledges, listen!

1241
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:12,280
Bitch! Now who's the baby?!

1242
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:14,381
- Holy shit.
- What the fuck?

1243
00:55:14,383 --> 00:55:16,550
If I don't get those drugs,
I'm gonna be grounded,

1244
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:18,720
and then I'll never
get to kiss Brixlee!

1245
00:55:18,722 --> 00:55:21,356
Max, what the fuck
are you doing?

1246
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:23,591
You sell drugs.
We came here to buy them.

1247
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:26,294
So now you're gonna
sell us the drugs.

1248
00:55:26,296 --> 00:55:28,363
Do not test me!

1249
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:30,301
Okay.

1250
00:55:32,434 --> 00:55:34,501
You want the drugs?
I'm not your parent. Here.

1251
00:55:34,503 --> 00:55:35,769
Thanks.

1252
00:55:35,771 --> 00:55:37,373
Oh, shit.

1253
00:55:38,675 --> 00:55:39,908
Oh, you're fucking dead.

1254
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,879
What the fuck's going on
down here?

1255
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:47,414
Whoa!

1256
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:49,450
She just dropped the charges.

1257
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:50,751
Oh, God.

1258
00:55:54,657 --> 00:55:56,691
♪ You'd better run ♪

1259
00:55:56,693 --> 00:55:57,691
♪ You'd better run ♪

1260
00:55:57,693 --> 00:55:59,260
Holy shit.

1261
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:01,595
♪ You'd better run
from the Devil's gun... ♪

1262
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,566
Max, watch out!

1263
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:10,537
I got your back.

1264
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:11,838
Thor!

1265
00:56:14,811 --> 00:56:16,577
Your ass is mine!

1266
00:56:20,249 --> 00:56:22,383
Oh, my God,
I just killed a man!

1267
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:23,952
Lucas, get the drugs!

1268
00:56:23,954 --> 00:56:25,553
♪ The Devil's fire ♪

1269
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:27,358
♪ Just won't go out... ♪

1270
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:30,591
We were never here!

1271
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:33,227
Start the fucking car!

1272
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:34,595
Max!

1273
00:56:34,597 --> 00:56:37,365
- What's happening?
- Fucking go!

1274
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:38,832
- What?
- Shit, shit, shit!

1275
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:41,970
Drive! Drive!

1276
00:56:50,947 --> 00:56:53,416
Lucas, drugs.

1277
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,617
No, no, no, no, no.

1278
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:56,950
Let me see
what's in the bottle.

1279
00:56:56,952 --> 00:57:00,323
Yeah. Of course.

1280
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:05,026
Okay, just-just give it to me.

1281
00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:13,600
Wow, you guys are
little badasses.

1282
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:15,736
'Cause we're the Bean Bag Boys.

1283
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:17,738
I don't know what that means.

1284
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,943
We have beanbags.

1285
00:57:21,778 --> 00:57:22,846
It's been real, guys.

1286
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:25,812
Have fun at your kissing party.

1287
00:57:25,814 --> 00:57:27,515
Thank you.

1288
00:57:31,621 --> 00:57:34,724
Oh.
We're only 1.7 miles away.

1289
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,059
What's wrong?

1290
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:40,662
We got the drone.
Everything worked out.

1291
00:57:40,664 --> 00:57:42,329
Max.

1292
00:57:42,331 --> 00:57:45,033
I got punched
in the fucking face, okay?

1293
00:57:45,035 --> 00:57:47,401
We bought drugs.

1294
00:57:47,403 --> 00:57:49,437
Can we just go home now?

1295
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:03,450
Guys, it's my dad.

1296
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:04,751
Hey, Dad.

1297
00:58:04,753 --> 00:58:06,421
Hey, buddy.
I got on the early flight,

1298
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:08,523
so I'll be home in 15 minutes.

1299
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:10,925
15 minutes from now
or 15 minutes from later?

1300
00:58:10,927 --> 00:58:13,061
Ha-ha, funny guy.

1301
00:58:13,063 --> 00:58:14,829
I'll see you soon.

1302
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:17,030
My dad will be home
in 15 minutes.

1303
00:58:17,032 --> 00:58:19,700
M-Maybe he won't notice
that the drone's gone.

1304
00:58:19,702 --> 00:58:21,702
He'll notice.
He's very observant.

1305
00:58:21,704 --> 00:58:24,472
That's why my mom
fell in love with him.

1306
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:26,474
The drone has to be home
before your dad.

1307
00:58:26,476 --> 00:58:28,108
I know.

1308
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,678
Just the drone. Not you.

1309
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,050
Just the drone.

1310
00:58:37,052 --> 00:58:39,355
Okay.

1311
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:43,423
Here we go.

1312
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:45,392
- Yes!
- Yes!

1313
00:58:48,831 --> 00:58:50,800
- Careful.
- I got this, I got this. Oh!

1314
00:58:52,802 --> 00:58:54,470
Fly like the wind, Max.

1315
00:58:55,572 --> 00:58:57,707
Yeah, uh, take a right up here.

1316
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:01,608
- I can see your house.
- There it is. There it is.

1317
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,577
The windows are closed.

1318
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,515
- Shit. What do I do?
- The chimney.

1319
00:59:11,086 --> 00:59:14,155
- It's very tight.
- You got this.

1320
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:15,523
Shit! I can't see.
I can't see.

1321
00:59:15,525 --> 00:59:17,425
There's ash
all over the camera.

1322
00:59:17,427 --> 00:59:18,593
Use the Force.

1323
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:19,727
- No, no, I can do this.
- Uh...

1324
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:20,928
I know my house perfectly.

1325
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,729
- I can do this with my eyes closed.
- Okay.

1326
00:59:22,731 --> 00:59:24,131
Don't break anything.

1327
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:26,033
Trust me, I got this.

1328
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,952
- Yeah!
- You did it! You got it!

1329
00:59:44,954 --> 00:59:47,021
- Yes!
- I'm the best pilot ever!

1330
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:48,455
Yes!

1331
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:58,733
- I think we did it.
- Yeah.

1332
00:59:58,735 --> 01:00:00,901
Mission accomplished.

1333
01:00:00,903 --> 01:00:03,204
Hey, Dad.

1334
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:05,205
Did you get home safe?

1335
01:00:05,207 --> 01:00:07,841
Cannot believe I trusted you!

1336
01:00:07,843 --> 01:00:09,010
I explicitly told you,

1337
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:10,544
- do not touch the drone!
- Uh-huh.

1338
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:13,046
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

1339
01:00:13,048 --> 01:00:14,782
Dad?

1340
01:00:14,784 --> 01:00:17,852
Dad, please...
say "I love you" back.

1341
01:00:17,854 --> 01:00:19,490
I need to hear it.

1342
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,593
Hello?

1343
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:27,727
My dad said that I'm grounded.

1344
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:30,564
Now I'm never gonna be able
to kiss Brixlee.

1345
01:00:30,566 --> 01:00:32,966
It's okay, Max.
There'll be other parties.

1346
01:00:32,968 --> 01:00:35,669
- Lucas, you don't get it.
- He's right, Lucas.

1347
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:37,137
This party could
change our lives,

1348
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:38,673
and you don't even care.

1349
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:40,173
It's not cool at all.

1350
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:41,975
Yeah, you would know
what's not cool.

1351
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:43,577
What the fuck does that mean?

1352
01:00:43,579 --> 01:00:45,512
Go sip a beer, Sippy Cup.

1353
01:00:45,514 --> 01:00:48,515
I love beer, so yes, I will.

1354
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:50,952
And you may think you're
so mature, but the truth is

1355
01:00:50,954 --> 01:00:53,187
you don't have pubes,
and I have six.

1356
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:55,890
You say you have pubes,
but you also say

1357
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:57,524
you drink beer,
and I know you don't.

1358
01:00:57,526 --> 01:01:00,794
- Stop arguing!
- Just admit you skipped the audition

1359
01:01:00,796 --> 01:01:01,995
because you thought
it wasn't cool

1360
01:01:01,997 --> 01:01:03,631
even though your voice
is a fucking gift.

1361
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:06,767
And you always talk a big game,
and you never back it up.

1362
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:09,035
- Like on the freeway.
- Oh, sorry.

1363
01:01:09,037 --> 01:01:10,271
I didn't want to cross
12 lanes of traffic

1364
01:01:10,273 --> 01:01:13,106
so you can kiss some skank.

1365
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:14,975
- Oh, shit.
- She's not a skank.

1366
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:16,943
She's the love of my life.
You take that back!

1367
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:18,678
Hey, no karate.

1368
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,648
Stop fighting!

1369
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,050
You should never
call a woman a skank.

1370
01:01:23,052 --> 01:01:25,952
You should never call
a woman anything.

1371
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:28,055
And you...

1372
01:01:28,057 --> 01:01:31,024
You made us ditch school,
run around with drugs,

1373
01:01:31,026 --> 01:01:33,794
and lock a cop
in a convenience store

1374
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:36,296
with what I now suspect
is a dildo!

1375
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:40,667
What the fuck are you
looking at, Gandalf?!

1376
01:01:40,669 --> 01:01:43,537
You guys don't understand shit.

1377
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,273
I have hormones
flowing through my body,

1378
01:01:45,275 --> 01:01:46,941
making me do crazy things.

1379
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:49,544
Do you even know
what it feels like

1380
01:01:49,546 --> 01:01:52,146
to want to rub up
against a tree all the time?

1381
01:01:52,148 --> 01:01:53,280
You think
you're better than us.

1382
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:55,615
Not better, just more mature.

1383
01:01:55,617 --> 01:01:57,684
I'm into romance
and grown-up shit,

1384
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,921
and you guys are still
into little kid stuff.

1385
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:01,789
I don't even know
why we're still friends.

1386
01:02:29,017 --> 01:02:32,753
Everything you like
is now canceled.

1387
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:35,990
Birthdays are canceled.
Holidays are canceled.

1388
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:38,191
Summers, canceled.

1389
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:39,827
Winter is coming.

1390
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:41,662
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- No, no, no.

1391
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:43,965
You are no longer allowed
to call me Daddy.

1392
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,233
Call me Andrew
or Mr. Newman or Warden.

1393
01:02:47,235 --> 01:02:50,972
Underneath that cherubic face,
Devil lives inside you.

1394
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:56,276
I will always love you
because you are my son,

1395
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:58,314
but I no longer like you.

1396
01:03:05,188 --> 01:03:09,293
Thorny. I just got off
the phone with Max's mom.

1397
01:03:10,892 --> 01:03:12,126
Did you know he skipped school

1398
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:13,628
and biked to the mall
by himself?

1399
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,129
- He said that?
- He did.

1400
01:03:15,131 --> 01:03:16,830
Promise me
you'll never do something

1401
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:19,066
as stupid as that, okay?

1402
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:20,704
I-I promise.

1403
01:03:24,307 --> 01:03:26,039
And then
we ran across the highway,

1404
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,774
my arm got ripped out,

1405
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:30,176
and a fake woman
shot out of a car.

1406
01:03:30,178 --> 01:03:32,213
But we still got the drugs.

1407
01:03:32,215 --> 01:03:33,881
But then we traded
the drone for it,

1408
01:03:33,883 --> 01:03:35,349
and-and Max destroyed
his house with it.

1409
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:38,218
But it was only because
he wanted to marry Brixlee,

1410
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,854
and now he can't
because he's grounded for life.

1411
01:03:40,856 --> 01:03:42,222
And we got into a huge fight,

1412
01:03:42,224 --> 01:03:43,758
and the Bean Bag Boys
are broke up, and...

1413
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,392
- Am I in trouble?
- Okay, son.

1414
01:03:45,394 --> 01:03:48,294
Now, look, I love a good story
with a bunch of gibberish

1415
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:49,997
just as much as anybody, okay?

1416
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:51,966
And I know you're going through
a stressful time.

1417
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:54,267
But it doesn't give you
a reason to tell us fibs.

1418
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:55,870
I'm not fibbing.

1419
01:03:55,872 --> 01:03:58,104
I'm 100% sure
you're fibbing to me.

1420
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:00,207
- I'm not fibbing.
- Okay. I think I understand

1421
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:01,709
what's happening here.

1422
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:03,711
You think you're losing us,

1423
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:06,213
and now you're worried you're
gonna lose your friends, too.

1424
01:04:06,215 --> 01:04:07,981
Look at me, man.

1425
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:09,816
We'll always be there, right?
I mean, and look,

1426
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:10,617
don't get me wrong.

1427
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:12,119
You know,
me and your mom are not

1428
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:13,720
the same people we were
when we first met.

1429
01:04:13,722 --> 01:04:14,921
Mm-hmm.

1430
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:16,256
Tend to grow apart sometimes.

1431
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:17,925
But-but it's okay.

1432
01:04:17,927 --> 01:04:19,225
You remember your hermit crab?

1433
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:21,829
- Herman? Yeah.
- That's right. Herman.

1434
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:24,465
- And you remember why he died?
- Oh, son of a...

1435
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:26,399
You told me he ran away!

1436
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:29,070
Technically, yes,
he ran away, but then he died.

1437
01:04:29,072 --> 01:04:30,370
Oh, my gosh. How?

1438
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:33,039
Herman died
because hermit crabs

1439
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,776
grow out of their shells,
and they need to find

1440
01:04:35,778 --> 01:04:37,745
new, bigger seashells
on the beach

1441
01:04:37,747 --> 01:04:40,314
to grow into, or they die,
and we didn't know that.

1442
01:04:40,316 --> 01:04:43,483
So, Herman died
because of you guys?

1443
01:04:43,485 --> 01:04:45,119
The point is...

1444
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:47,220
you and your friends
are growing and changing,

1445
01:04:47,222 --> 01:04:49,189
and y'all need to find
bigger shells.

1446
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:51,225
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

1447
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:53,359
Okay, look, you need to blame

1448
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,829
those pet store owners, okay,
because they did not give us

1449
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:58,134
the information
about hermit crabs...

1450
01:05:12,081 --> 01:05:14,749
It's Lucas.

1451
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,483
You scared the shit out of me.

1452
01:05:16,485 --> 01:05:19,887
I didn't want
your parents to see my face.

1453
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:21,888
Why are you even here?

1454
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,890
I've grown a lot
in the last two hours.

1455
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:25,526
My parents' divorce
has really changed me.

1456
01:05:25,528 --> 01:05:27,294
If the Bean Bag Boys
don't grow together,

1457
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:29,095
they'll grow apart.

1458
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:30,830
I don't want that.

1459
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:33,399
I don't want to get
a divorce from you.

1460
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,535
Then you need to go
to Soren's party.

1461
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:38,338
- You need to sneak out.
- I can't. I'm grounded.

1462
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,975
Besides, Brixlee's necklace
is still in the kiln.

1463
01:05:40,977 --> 01:05:43,343
Let me worry about
the necklace.

1464
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:45,347
And what are your parents
gonna do, double-ground you?

1465
01:05:46,948 --> 01:05:49,251
Is Brixlee your forever or not?

1466
01:05:50,986 --> 01:05:53,086
Then you need to come
with me now.

1467
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:56,256
Fine, I'll go, but I'm not
apologizing to Thor.

1468
01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:59,225
- He's not coming.
- Good.

1469
01:05:59,227 --> 01:06:01,227
Fuck that bitch.

1470
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:03,530
I'll go get my jacket.

1471
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:05,999
- Hey, Max.
- Yeah?

1472
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:07,837
Bring that dick.

1473
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,910
You said Thor wasn't coming.

1474
01:06:16,912 --> 01:06:18,245
What the hell is he doing here?

1475
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:19,280
I Parent-Trapped your asses.

1476
01:06:19,282 --> 01:06:20,548
See, now we're all in

1477
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,419
a bigger hermit crab shell
together.

1478
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:25,852
It made sense
when my parents said it.

1479
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,854
So, you took the blame
for us, huh?

1480
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:29,356
Yeah. I thought about

1481
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,392
what you would do,
and did the opposite.

1482
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:34,894
This party, it's gonna be
an epic rager.

1483
01:06:34,896 --> 01:06:36,396
Okay, Sippy Cup.

1484
01:06:36,398 --> 01:06:39,001
Just stay out of my way,
Maxi Pad.

1485
01:06:49,211 --> 01:06:52,379
Aw, don't you boys look cute.

1486
01:06:52,381 --> 01:06:54,381
Everybody's in the basement.

1487
01:06:54,383 --> 01:06:56,850
I don't even want to know
what's going on down there.

1488
01:06:56,852 --> 01:06:58,519
Come on in, fellas.

1489
01:06:58,521 --> 01:07:00,387
Hi.

1490
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:01,988

01:07:24,613 --> 01:07:28,582
Max, I want you
to meet Brixlee.

1500
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:31,184
Hi. I'm Max.

1501
01:07:31,186 --> 01:07:33,320
Hi.

1502
01:07:33,322 --> 01:07:35,455
It's nice to finally meet you.

1503
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:36,923
You, too.

1504
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:38,626
Cool jacket.

1505
01:07:38,628 --> 01:07:40,327
Thank you.

1506
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:43,430
I got it all by myself,
with my mom.

1507
01:07:43,432 --> 01:07:46,200
I go shopping with my mom, too.

1508
01:07:46,202 --> 01:07:48,371
This is going so well.

1509
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:52,075
Did you bring the necklace?

1510
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:56,075
Brixlee, this is for you.

1511
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:58,945
Oh, thanks. It's pretty.

1512
01:07:58,947 --> 01:08:00,113
They're an-al.

1513
01:08:00,115 --> 01:08:01,414
Ooh, fancy.

1514
01:08:04,486 --> 01:08:06,986
I'm gonna wear this later.

1515
01:08:06,988 --> 01:08:08,454
Thanks, Max.

1516
01:08:08,456 --> 01:08:11,057
What's up, Sippy Cup?

1517
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,959
Not much.

1518
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:14,561
Just, uh, got into a fight

1519
01:08:14,563 --> 01:08:18,132
with a bunch of men
and, uh, stole a beer.

1520
01:08:18,134 --> 01:08:21,168
There's no way Sippy Cup
is gonna drink it.

1521
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,503
Not only am I gonna drink it,

1522
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:26,205
I'm gonna break the record.

1523
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:29,476
I'm gonna take four sips.

1524
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,110
Four is impossible.

1525
01:08:31,112 --> 01:08:33,379
- Soren can't even do four.
- Shut up.

1526
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:35,919
Drink.

1527
01:08:52,735 --> 01:08:54,267
That's one.

1528
01:08:54,269 --> 01:08:56,473
Big deal.

1529
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:00,610
That's two.

1530
01:09:01,744 --> 01:09:04,014
Mm-kay.

1531
01:09:08,718 --> 01:09:10,284
That's three!

1532
01:09:10,286 --> 01:09:12,086
This is insane.

1533
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:14,488
He's gonna barf.

1534
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,289
Somebody get him a sippy cup.

1535
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:19,193
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

1536
01:09:19,195 --> 01:09:22,695
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!
Sippy Cup!

1537
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:25,632
Sippy Cup!
Sippy Cup! Sippy Cup!

1538
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:27,767
Sippy Cup! Sippy...

1539
01:09:27,769 --> 01:09:29,770
That's fucking four!

1540
01:09:29,772 --> 01:09:31,739
Oh, fuck!

1541
01:09:31,741 --> 01:09:33,474
Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

1542
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:35,441
Thor! Thor!
Thor! Thor! Thor!

1543
01:09:35,443 --> 01:09:37,711
I'm a fucking alcoholic!

1544
01:09:40,415 --> 01:09:41,648
No way!

1545
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:43,617
Four sips. Badass.

1546
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:44,752
Mad respect to Thor.

1547
01:09:44,754 --> 01:09:46,587
Eyes up here.

1548
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:49,489
If you don't consent
to kissing, that's cool.

1549
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:51,557
You can go play VR upstairs.

1550
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:53,159
But if you're staying
down here,

1551
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:54,595
you better strap in,

1552
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:56,430
because shit's about
to get real.

1553
01:09:56,432 --> 01:09:58,065
- Hell yeah.
- Okay.

1554
01:09:58,067 --> 01:09:59,466
Let's spin a bottle.

1555
01:09:59,468 --> 01:10:02,703
Well, then it's a good thing
I got a bottle right here!

Oh, no.

Brixlee...

1567
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,418
your turn.

dramatic thing I've ever seen.

1570
01:11:34,897 --> 01:11:36,800
He's not gonna do it.

1571
01:11:38,601 --> 01:11:39,669
He's gonna do it.

1572
01:11:41,336 --> 01:11:43,669
I can't do it.

1573
01:11:45,273 --> 01:11:47,708
People don't change.
He's still Sippy Cup.

1574
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,575
Wait, wait.

His name is Thor.

1580
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:00,520
And everyone knows your mom
plagiarized her cookbook.

1581
01:12:00,522 --> 01:12:02,491
Thor, wait up.

1582
01:12:07,897 --> 01:12:10,596
I'm sorry I called you
a try-hard.

1583
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:12,932
Nah, you were right.

1584
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:14,668
This whole time,
I've been trying

1585
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,306
to be someone who I wasn't.

1586
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,573
I got an earring.

1587
01:12:19,575 --> 01:12:21,708
I drank a beer.

1588
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,776
I quit singing.

1589
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:25,546
Yeah.

1590
01:12:25,548 --> 01:12:27,914
I guess I went
a little crazy today, too.

1591
01:12:31,519 --> 01:12:33,553
Let's get out of here.

1592
01:12:33,555 --> 01:12:36,657
No.
You don't want to do that.

1593
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:39,525
You're gonna stay down here
and kiss Brixlee.

1594
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:43,198
The Bean Bag Boys
do everything together.

1595
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:45,766
Not everything.

1596
01:12:45,768 --> 01:12:47,637
Not anymore.

1597
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,907
Maybe those old girls
were right.

1598
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:56,443
Maybe we're on
different paths.

1599
01:12:56,445 --> 01:12:59,312
Yeah.

1600
01:12:59,314 --> 01:13:00,782
Then what are you gonna do?

1601
01:13:02,483 --> 01:13:05,351
I don't know.
I just know it's not this.

1602
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:07,320
No way.

1603
01:13:07,322 --> 01:13:08,454
This is insane.

1604
01:13:08,456 --> 01:13:10,257
Forget spin the bottle.

1605
01:13:10,259 --> 01:13:13,596
Now, go over there
and kiss your future wife.

1606
01:13:15,397 --> 01:13:18,231
Bye.

1607
01:13:18,233 --> 01:13:20,236
Bye.

1608
01:13:46,762 --> 01:13:49,933
Brixlee, can I kiss you?

1609
01:13:51,433 --> 01:13:52,769
Okay.

1610
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:24,030
Cool.

1611
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:25,899
Where am I?

1612
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:27,668
Oh, here I am.

1613
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:30,069
Lucas, I'm leaving.

1614
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:31,937
You sure you don't want
to try this?

1615
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:33,610
Nah, I'm good.

1616
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:40,047
Want to go to my house
and play Ascension?

1617
01:14:40,049 --> 01:14:42,952
I don't want to play
Ascension anymore.

1618
01:14:44,018 --> 01:14:46,052
Then who am I gonna play with?

1619
01:14:46,054 --> 01:14:47,721
You'll find someone.

1620
01:14:49,825 --> 01:14:50,990
My face feels so tingly.

1621
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:52,859
No way.

1622
01:14:52,861 --> 01:14:55,061
Oh, my God.
This is amazing!

1623
01:14:55,063 --> 01:14:57,631
I can't believe
you guys are here.

1624
01:14:57,633 --> 01:14:59,632
Oh, this is so amazing.

1625
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:03,002
- Hi. - Oh, hi.
- Sit down.

1626
01:15:03,004 --> 01:15:04,604
Please no, please no.
Don't kill us.

1627
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:05,838
Look what happened.

1628
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,908
How do you know Soren?

1629
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:10,510
Is he your boyfriend?

1630
01:15:10,512 --> 01:15:13,713
He's my brother.
I love that piece of shit.

1631
01:15:19,655 --> 01:15:21,754
You guys,
where's everybody else?

1632
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:24,056
Where's your friend
with the sad eyes?

1633
01:15:24,058 --> 01:15:26,525
- Sad boy Max.
- In the basement kissing.

1634
01:15:26,527 --> 01:15:28,395
It's an orgy down there.

1635
01:15:28,397 --> 01:15:29,796
And you guys aren't into that?

1636
01:15:29,798 --> 01:15:31,765
- Mm-mm.
- Aw, it's okay.

1637
01:15:31,767 --> 01:15:32,998
You're only in sixth grade.

1638
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,435
You guys are gonna
figure it out.

1639
01:15:35,437 --> 01:15:37,738
- Yeah, you have your whole life for that. No rush.
- Yeah.

1640
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,771
- No rush.
- No rush.

1641
01:15:38,773 --> 01:15:41,440
I mean, what do you love?

1642
01:15:41,442 --> 01:15:45,878
Ascension, rules,
antidrug campaigns...

1643
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,681
grilled cheese.

1644
01:15:47,683 --> 01:15:49,548
- Mmm.
- Oh, I could fuck with a grilled cheese right now.

1645
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,784
- Aw...
- Guys, I'm gonna make us grilled cheese.

1646
01:15:50,786 --> 01:15:52,953
- Oh, yeah. That sounds so good.
- Nice.

1647
01:15:52,955 --> 01:15:55,154
What about you, sleeveless?
What are you into?

1648
01:15:55,156 --> 01:15:57,591
I love to sing.

1649
01:15:57,593 --> 01:15:58,958
Yes.

1650
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,694
I actually skipped

1651
01:16:00,696 --> 01:16:02,462
my audition today
for the musical.

1652
01:16:02,464 --> 01:16:04,431
- No.
- Now I can't be in it.

1653
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:05,998
- No.
- What? You have to

1654
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,700
convince them
to let you audition.

1655
01:16:07,702 --> 01:16:09,636
You must. You must.

1656
01:16:09,638 --> 01:16:10,703
- Audition.
- Shh. Sing for us.

1657
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:11,504
- No.
- Oh, my God.

1658
01:16:11,506 --> 01:16:12,939
Sing for us.
You're a baby bird.

1659
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:13,907
No, come on.
We missed our concert.

1660
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:16,142
- Sing for us.
- So, no grilled cheese?

1661
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:17,543
- Sing for us. Sing for us.
- No.

1662
01:16:17,545 --> 01:16:18,548

You know I'd never miss
one of your shows.

1715
01:20:23,392 --> 01:20:25,691
It was so cool
when you stabbed that pimp.

1716

Thank you.

1717
01:20:27,062 --> 01:20:29,361
Oh, sorry.
Thor, this is Scout.

1718
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:31,664
- You were really good.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1719
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:33,302
I was much better
in the matinee.

1720
01:20:34,702 --> 01:20:36,772
I'm gonna go find Cassidy.

1721
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:40,039
I thought you were
still grounded.

1722
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:42,909
It ended yesterday.
A month in the hole.

1723
01:20:42,911 --> 01:20:45,278
Thanks again
for taking the fall.

1724
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,180
You would've done the same.

1725
01:20:47,182 --> 01:20:49,248
Well, well, well.

1726
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,850
Look who's here. Me.

1727
01:20:50,852 --> 01:20:53,352
Hey!

1728
01:20:53,354 --> 01:20:55,691
Feels like we haven't
talked in weeks.

1729
01:20:57,259 --> 01:20:58,925
Yeah.

1730
01:20:58,927 --> 01:21:00,092
Max.

1731
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:02,328
My mom said she'll drop us
at frozen yogurt

1732
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,064
if your mom will pick us up.

1733
01:21:04,066 --> 01:21:05,765
Great.
Be there in a second, babe.

1734
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,100
Okay, babe.

1735
01:21:07,102 --> 01:21:09,302
So, how's it going with Scout?

1736
01:21:09,304 --> 01:21:10,436
Good.

1737
01:21:10,438 --> 01:21:12,337
But hard. But good.

1738
01:21:12,339 --> 01:21:14,740
A relationship is
a lot of work.

1739
01:21:14,742 --> 01:21:16,379
Don't let anyone
tell you differently.

1740
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:19,479
Hey.
Uh, Lucas, you still want

1741
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:21,715
to play Ascension
with me and the guys later?

1742
01:21:21,717 --> 01:21:24,687
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Classic Lucas.

1743
01:21:25,987 --> 01:21:28,354
Carlos and those SCAB guys
seem cool.

1744
01:21:28,356 --> 01:21:30,457
They're cool.

1745
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:32,995
But they're not
the Bean Bag Boys.

1746
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:37,165
Max.

1747
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,870
All right.

1748
01:21:43,304 --> 01:21:45,971
I guess, I guess I should go.

1749
01:21:45,973 --> 01:21:47,873
Yeah, all right.

1750
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,876
Well...

1751
01:21:49,878 --> 01:21:51,511
Yeah.

1752
01:22:06,827 --> 01:22:09,098
I missed you guys.

1753
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:19,404
Let's make a promise.

1754
01:22:19,406 --> 01:22:21,775
Even if we don't hang out
all the time,

1755
01:22:21,777 --> 01:22:23,943
we'll still always be there
for the big stuff.

1756
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:26,182
Bean Bag Boys for life.

1757
01:22:27,249 --> 01:22:29,149
Bean Bag Boys for life.

1758
01:22:29,151 --> 01:22:31,253
Bean Bag Boys
for life.

1759
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:42,864
Wait.

1760
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:46,900
There's something
I have to show you.

1761
01:22:46,902 --> 01:22:48,838

How cool is it?

1768
01:23:04,853 --> 01:23:06,586
Your parents love to play.

1769
01:23:06,588 --> 01:23:09,955
- What do they do with it?
- They swing on it.

1770
01:23:09,957 --> 01:23:11,557
